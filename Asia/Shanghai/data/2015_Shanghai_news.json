According to Chinese state media, at least 35 people were killed and 42 injured in the crush, which happened in the city\u2019s Bund riverfront area at about 11.30pm local time. Emergency services soon arrived to aid the wounded in Chen Yi Square, an area that often becomes crowded during major events. It was not immediately clear what triggered the stampede. The official Xinhua news agency said many of the injured were students. Photographs on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, showed densely packed crowds of revellers along the Bund, which lies on the bank of the Huangpu river. In some photographs, rescue workers were seen trying to resuscitate victims on the pavement while ambulances waited nearby. Authorities had shown concern about crowd control in the days leading up to New Year\u2019s Eve. They recently cancelled an annual 3D laser show on the Bund which attracted 300,000 people last year. New Zealand, the first country to celebrate the new year, celebrated with fireworks launched from Auckland\u2019s Sky Tower, while in Australia an estimated 1.5 million spectators lined the harbour to watch the now renowned firework display on Sydney Harbour Bridge. The event, broadcast to an estimated billion people, featured a tribute to the two hostages killed in the December siege inside a cafe before seven tonnes of fireworks, including 10,000 aerial explosives and 100,000 pyrotechnics, went up in smoke. In Indonesia, celebrations were muted because of the recent loss of AirAsia Flight 8501. In Japan, people filled temples and shrines to pray for peace as bells struck 108 times to mark the number of temptations in Buddhism. Dubai saw hundreds of thousands of revellers watch fireworks launch from the Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building, which was wrapped with 70,000 panels to create the biggest ever illuminated LED facade. Meanwhile, a light show and fireworks marked the beginning of 2015 at the Olympic park in Beijing. Moscow was one of the first cities in Europe to mark the new year, with fireworks detonating over St Basil\u2019s Cathedral and the Kremlin. In London, 100,000 people gathered on the banks of the Thames to watch an 11-minute firework display involving 12,000 pyrotechnics. This year\u2019s event was ticketed for the first time, with revellers paying \u00a310 each to access the fenced-off viewing area, after around half a million tried to squeeze into the area around the South Bank last year. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a ticket, the best place to watch the #londonnye fireworks will be live on the BBC,\u201d the office of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, said on Twitter after telling the public that last year\u2019s crowded conditions meant that a free event was \u201cuntenable\u201d. However, he came under fire from opposition politicians over the ticketing and for the erection of mobile signs hammering home the message that the fireworks were being shown on the BBC. Fiona Twycross, a member of the London Assembly, described the signs as an insult to Londoners and visitors to the city and accused the mayor of privatising New Year by bringing in the ticketing system. Those who bought tickets, however, described the atmosphere as \u201celectric\u201d. In Scotland, Hogmanay celebrations on Stirling Castle\u2019s esplanade were cancelled due to high winds. A live outdoor concert had been due to take place on the esplanade, with music from The Waterboys, Skerryvore, JJ Gilmour and Model Aeroplanes, followed by a fireworks display. However, the event was cancelled as high winds meant public safety could not be guaranteed, police said. Chief Inspector Paul Rollo, Stirling policing commander, said: \u201cHogmanay is one of the highlights of the year in the city, and the joint decision to cancel the street party was only taken after lengthy discussion and deliberation with the organisers. \u201cWe prioritise the safety of people attending an event and with the poor weather conditions right now with winds far stronger than expected, unfortunately this could not be assured.\u201d Up to 75,000 people were expected to gather for the world-famous event in Edinburgh, which saw Lily Allen headlining the Concert in the Gardens. There were five live stages throughout the city, with 13 acts performing, including Soul II Soul and Twin Atlantic, plus four firework displays. Early celebrations included a torchlight parade when a cast of thousands carried flaming torches through the historic Old Town. Organisers said tickets for events have been bought by those in more than 70 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Mauritius, Slovakia and South Africa. Wilson Peery, 33, from Oregon, USA, travelled to Scotland especially to attend Edinburgh\u2019s street party. He said: \u201cI came here in 2008 and made a split second decision to come back this year with a group of friends. We all just decided to come. \u201cI just really like the energy and the fact that there are so many things to do. The torchlight procession is something special.\u201d As the new year reached Rio De Janeiro, millions flocked to Copacabana beach, where fireworks were launched from boats and artists and DJs performed on three stages for a traditional all beach party where many revellers wear white. In Havana, people roasted pigs for their traditional New Year\u2019s Eve family dinners, often using a pit dug in the backyard. And in New York, thousands gathered in Times Square to see in 2015 and watch the traditional dropping of a giant crystal ball at midnight.

Eschewing computer power for sharp pencils and tracing paper, father and son architect team Quinlan and Francis Terry are drafting classically inspired designs for some of the capital\u2019s most prominent sites in a fightback against plans for hundreds of new skyscrapers. Working from offices wallpapered with copies of the Times from 1957 in the picturesque historic town of Dedham, they are the antithesis of their modernist rivals in central London studios. But their latest scheme confirms them as a spearhead of a growing movement for an alternative urbanism. As part of a bid for one of the most sought-after and prominent \u201csuper-prime\u201d sites in the capital, they have drafted a gigantic apartment \u201cgroundscraper\u201d on the site of the army\u2019s Hyde Park barracks in the style of the Paris city blocks planned by Georges Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann in the 19th century. It could be the sign of things to come. David Cameron last month appointed Quinlan Terry to a government panel advising on new housing design standards and awarded him a CBE. With its stone facade and mansard roof, the traditional proposal for the site, which the Ministry of Defence is considering selling off, is the latest gambit in a broadening campaign against schemes for clusters of towers on prime land, maximising profits at the expense, critics argue, of human-scale streets and public spaces.

Photograph: Quinlan and Francis Terry    The counter-movement\u2019s key players include Prince Charles, who earlier this year made a speech backing a new wave of traditional architecture to help solve London\u2019s housing problems; Paul Murrain, an urbanist and until recently an architecture adviser to Charles; and Nicholas Boys Smith \u2013 a former adviser to the chancellor, George Osborne \u2013 who has set up a lobby group against the direction development is taking under the banner Create Streets. About 250 towers of more than 20 storeys are being planned in London according to research by the New London Architecture centre, sparking unfavourable comparisons with the unchecked development of Dubai and Shanghai. Critics have identified plans for 18,000 new homes around Battersea power station, which include schemes by Frank Gehry and Norman Foster, as key examples of the trend. Developers say they are building high to maximise the number of homes that can be built in an increasingly crowded city facing a housing shortage, and modernist architects believe the traditional styles used by the Terrys and favoured by Charles are inappropriate for a 21st-century global city. \u201cI think we have the hearts of ordinary people on our side every time, but not the politicians or the architects,\u201d said Quinlan Terry. \u201cThat is sad because we have right on our side. Steel and glass don\u2019t produce useful buildings that last more than 25 years. We are trying to create density in a grain rather than with a tower of 20 storeys and space all around it. If you look at Rome, Paris and Milan you have that dense urban grain.\u201d There are signs the movement is gaining support from political leaders. Create Streets has lobbied the Treasury, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Greater London authority, and earlier this year it worked with Francis Terry and the local community to propose an alternative plan to build hundreds of homes on the site of Royal Mail\u2019s central London sorting office at Mount Pleasant. Instead of the series of apartment blocks rising to 15 storeys, designed by leading modernist architects including Wilkinson Eyre and Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, Francis Terry drafted plans for eight-storey classical terraces around a \u201ccircus\u201d open space. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, granted planning consent for the modernist scheme, but asked for the \u201cbeautiful\u201d alternative plans to be submitted as well.

Photograph: Gehry Partners    The Terrys\u2019 Hyde Park barracks proposal has echoes of Charles\u2019s 2011 successful intervention over plans to build housing on Chelsea barracks, when he torpedoed Richard Rogers\u2019 plans by writing to the prime minister of Qatar, whose royal family owns the site. He rubbished the modernist scheme, promoted Quinlan Terry\u2019s classical alternative and the owners sacked their architect. Arguably even more sensitive, the decision by a consortium of bidders said to include Chinese and Gulf investors to select Quinlan and Francis Terry on the Hyde Park site, is likely to be seen as an attempt to avoid similar royal disapproval. In the summer, the consortium leader, Bruce Rippon, said the scheme would be \u201csomething which would make future kings and queens be proud\u201d. The Ministry of Defence is likely to invite bids for the site which is expected to fetch about \u00a3650m. A report by Create Streets said most people are happier, less stressed, are less likely to be victims of crime in conventional streets rather than large multi-storey buildings. It said they also find it easier to bring up children and to behave more sociably with their neighbours and that the value of property on conventionally designed streets goes up faster than large multi-storey buildings, and that the lifetime costs of large buildings are higher and they tend to be pulled down earlier. Boys Smith said Britain was in danger of returning to some of the worst excesses of 1960s planning. \u201cLondon\u2019s population is rising fast but our response, a second generation of multistorey tower blocks, many for social housing, is not the right one,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people, most of the time, don\u2019t want to live in big blocks. We are concerned that in the long term the flaws in these large multistorey buildings will make themselves very apparent.\u201d Create Streets is advocating popular and timeless architecture instead and says that while traditional and classical styles are not always the solution, they are often most popular with local communities. Prince Charles has spoken of\u00a0his desire to see more mansion blocks, between five and eight storeys and told architects in a speech last year: \u201cThere is enormous potential in taking the mid-rise housing block and adapting it to tackle the demands of 21st-century population growth.\u201d", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "London", "Prince Charles", "UK news", "Skyscrapers", "Cities", "Heritage", "Culture", "Construction industry", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-02T18:15:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/03/fatal-shanghai-stampede-fewer-police-new-years-eve", "sentences": ["Lax safety measures and a shortage of police officers may have contributed to the fatal New Year\u2019s Eve stampede in Shanghai which killed 36 people and left scores injured.", "Before the 2013 celebrations, Shanghai authorities deployed 6,000 police officers and requested help from military police to manage the 300,000-strong crowd.", "Shanghai had hosted a New Year light show on the Bund riverfront for the previous three years, but authorities cancelled it this year because of concerns about overcrowding.", "Shanghai people know it, and the whole country knows it."], "title": "Fatal Shanghai stampede: 5,000 fewer police on duty than last new year", "article": "Lax safety measures and a shortage of police officers may have contributed to the fatal New Year\u2019s Eve stampede in Shanghai which killed 36 people and left scores injured. There were 5,000 fewer officers on duty on Wednesday night than on New Year\u2019s Eve the previous year, according to Associated Press. Traffic controls implemented the previous year were also abandoned because the official light show had been cancelled. Before the 2013 celebrations, Shanghai authorities deployed 6,000 police officers and requested help from military police to manage the 300,000-strong crowd. Just 700 officers were on duty this year. According to state media, last year police closed off access to an elevated viewing platform and to the nearest subway station in an attempt to control the crowd. But last week, despite the same number of revellers showing up to welcome in the new year, the subway station remained open and people were free to climb the staircases to the platform. Shanghai had hosted a New Year light show on the Bund riverfront for the previous three years, but authorities cancelled it this year because of concerns about overcrowding. Instead, a smaller light show was held at a nearby 2,000-person venue that required admission tickets. But hundreds of thousands of people still turned up for the traditional show on the riverfront. When the authorities became alarmed by the size of the crowd, they drafted in another 500 police officers, but by then it was too late to prevent one of the biggest disasters to strike a Chinese city in years. Three dozen people ended up asphyxiated or trampled to death in a stampede at the bottom of a 17-step, 5-metre-wide concrete staircase which led to one of the best vantage points to view the Huangpu River. Nearly 50 others were injured. Witnesses said people were trying to climb the staircase to the viewing platform as others tried to get down, causing panic and confusion. Investigations are continuing into how the tragedy occurred. \u201cYou cancelled the light show, but did you properly notify the public?\u201d asked a father who lost his daughter in the stampede, according to AP. \u201cOnce people started to show up in the hundreds of thousands, did you have backup measures to ensure safety? What were you doing during the time the crowds were growing? The government has been seriously derelict of its duties,\u201d he said. Zhao Chu, a local resident, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a tradition to see the lights on the Bund on New Year\u2019s Eve. Shanghai people know it, and the whole country knows it. \u201cThe government should have foreseen the crowds on that night. Such incidents could have been avoided.\u201d Patrol officer Wang Qiang told state media: \u201cBecause there was no scheduled event, there was no traffic control,\u201d adding that tourists kept asking him if there would be a light show.

The discovery has added to McDonald\u2019s troubles in Japan, where it has more than 3,000 outlets, coming soon after it was forced to restrict the sale of french fries because of industrial action at ports in the US, where it sources the product.

But, though these abstract compositions are not conventional landscapes, his sense of shape and light is influenced by the three places he knows best: Ireland, his birthplace in 1945 and the homeland of his parents; north London, where he grew up and went to art school; and New York, where today he mainly lives and works, now a US citizen. So which of this trinity of influences figures most in his dreams and ideas? \u201cI\u2019m Irish in the mythic, romantic sense but, in the living sense, I\u2019m a Londoner. My wife [the artist Liliane Tomasko] is Swiss and, at home in America, we like to sing Maybe It\u2019s Because I\u2019m a Londoner and take the piss out of it.\u201d On the day we meet, he is briefly visiting the Timothy Taylor gallery in London, his UK representative, on a stopover between New York and Shanghai, where he has just become the first western artist to have a major retrospective. Follow the Heart covers five decades of his work, and will transfer to Beijing in March. But he has been spending increasing amounts of time in London recently \u2013 summer trips and visits to the funerals of elderly relatives \u2013 and is increasingly tempted to remigrate from the US: \u201cMy son is five and he is my most important project, and I don\u2019t want to bring him up in the land of guns.\u201d He fantasises about buying the house in Highbury, close to the old Arsenal stadium, where he grew up. The first art he remembers seeing was at the local Catholic church, the series of devotional paintings known as the \u201cstations of the cross\u201d, which show the scenes leading to Christ\u2019s crucifixion: \u201cThey were very geometric, like Russian paintings.\u201d Catholicism also influenced his artistic development in another way: \u201cAs a child, the most important people in my life were my pet rabbit and Mary, mother of Jesus. Plaster of Paris was pretty cheap, and so I\u2019d make sculptures of Mary and the rabbit and play games with them. They\u2019d get married and have tea parties and so on.\u201d     \u2018I don\u2019t know how a painting is \u00adgoing to come out\u2019 \u2026 Kind of Red (2013) by Sean Scully. Photograph: Christoph Knoch/Arla Borel    The Scullys had left Dublin for London when he was four and, though Ireland remained present in the accents and anecdotes of relatives, it was a long time before he went back. He was unable to go on a secondary school trip there because he suffered what is medically known as nocturnal enuresis until the age of 20: \u201cAnd if you\u2019d been brought up by my parents, you\u2019d have wet the bed as well.\u201d Throughout adolescence he wore, in a now discredited Pavlovian experiment, a sort of urinary-chastity belt at night that triggered a ringing bell when it became wet, waking up the wearer. So what was it about his parents that brought on this condition? \u201cConstant extreme anxiety. It was like living in a warzone. My father was a genius footballer, a natural two-footed centre-forward who had played for Arsenal juniors, but he was sent out to work aged 14 and so lived out his life in a frustrated, rageful way. And my mother was a fucking force of nature, man. So, between them, it was always warring and discord and the constant threat of violence in the air. She would provoke my father until he couldn\u2019t take it any more \u2026 \u201d So he hit her? \u201cHe had. And he hit me a few times. But he also saved me a few times from gangs and so on \u2013 because we grew up very rough. Although they probably have cappuccino there now.\u201d Growing up poor in north London, did he have much exposure to art? \u201cNot art, but showbiz. My mother used to sing Unchained Melody, which is a profoundly melancholic song. And my art is very melancholy. We used to go to places like Margate in the summer and there\u2019d be talent contests and my mother would enter and win every time.\u201d It was only in his 30s, when a touring exhibition of his went to Ireland, that he spent time in his birthplace as an adult: \u201cThat was when Ireland went \u2018whooooooosh\u2019 in me.\u201d He adopts an Irish accent to personify the island: \u201c\u2018Get over here, Sean, you\u2019re an Irishman and that\u2019s the end of it.\u2019\u201d Two Irish writers \u2013 James Joyce and Samuel Beckett \u2013 are usually mentioned in connection with Scully\u2019s work, and have been reflected in it: one of the pictures he\u2019s currently working on features Lucky, the slave from Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot. But, for me, the artist\u2019s work has also always invoked the poems of Seamus Heaney. The square is the dominant configuration in Scully\u2019s abstracts, and the same shape \u2013 representing neat agricultural fields and the dimensions of a four-line stanza \u2013 recurs throughout Heaney\u2019s verse, overlapping, in a sequence called Squarings, with a type of throw used in a children\u2019s game of marbles.     \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted my art to be global rather than local. I want to make paintings that people everywhere can relate to\u2019 \u2026 Sean Scully. Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian    Scully\u2019s wide smile lights up: \u201cYes, I remember that word from my childhood. Seamus and I were good friends. He asked to use one of my pictures on a book of his, Opened Ground. And then, out of that, I did a series called Cut Ground. I\u2019m constantly referring to land, cutting into land. And a lot of Seamus\u2019 poetry is about cutting. It\u2019s a very Irish thing: cutting into soil that has accumulated over thousands of years.\u201d Scully points to one of his paintings, which is hanging on the wall of the office we\u2019ve borrowed at the gallery. \u201cActually, that\u2019s one of the Cut Ground series over there. It\u2019s called Battered Ground.\u201d So what does he think when he suddenly sees one of his pictures like that? Does he remember painting it? \u201cOh, yes, absolutely. I painted that in Dulwich, in 1990 or so, because I\u2019d bought that house in 1989. I thought, whatever happened, I\u2019d always have that house, but I had to sell it and give it to my ex-wife.\u201d He may have a vivid memory of his completed works, but there\u2019s little clarity in advance: \u201cI\u2019m not in control of it: I don\u2019t know how a painting is going to come out. For decades, I never used green in a picture, and suddenly I\u2019m using it all the time. But I\u2019m really not conscious of making those decisions.\u201d Twice shortlisted for the Turner prize, he used to dream of a big show at Tate Modern, but insists that the Chinese show means more: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted my art to be global rather than local. I want to make paintings that people everywhere can relate to.\u201d And perhaps an abstract artist is more likely to achieve that ambition than a figurative one, because colours and shapes are a shared international language? \u201cAbsolutely. That is one reason that it appeals to me.\u201d     \u2018I want to live to 95 \u2013 to be there for my son \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m still staggering out of the chair to paint\u2019 \u2026 Blue Red, from the Cut Ground series (2011) by Sean Scully.  Photograph: Timothy Taylor Gallery    Scully is an admirer of the Russian artist Kazimir Malevich (1879-1935). Malevich\u2019s work was suppressed and destroyed by the Russian Communist authorities because abstraction was seen as a decadent inferior to the favoured artistic mode of socialist realism. But, conversely, there is a suspicion that the growing popularity of abstraction in China is due to the fact that the genre is very hard to censor. \u201cIt\u2019s uncensorable,\u201d Scully agrees. \u201cHowever, that said, from what I see when I go to China, the censorship is minimal.\u201d I suggest that Ai Weiwei, who remains under heavy surveillance and travel restrictions, might not agree. \u201cAh, I knew you were going to say Ai Weiwei. He was a student of mine [in New York]; I know him very well. He\u2019s manipulating all that to stimulate his market in the west; he\u2019s playing a game against China, and the west loves him for that.\u201d But he did get beaten up by the police, didn\u2019t he? \u201cHe got whacked on the head, yes. But I got banged on the head once in jolly old London, in Trafalgar Square, protesting against apartheid. I\u2019m not saying China\u2019s liberal, like we are, but I\u2019ll tell you something: it\u2019s on its way.\u201d Scully has suffered painful times, including, in 1983, the death of a son from a previous marriage (\u201cbasically, I went insane but didn\u2019t deal with it because I wanted to keep painting\u201d) and, last year, near-fatal complications from medication for a back injury. Nothing, though, has ever kept him from his studio for long. \u201cI went to see a therapist for a while and, in the end, he told me to go away. He said: \u2018Although there\u2019s a lot wrong with you, you like yourself the way you are. And he was right. I\u2019ve made 1,400 paintings by hand. You\u2019d have to be a madman to do that.

But building more \u2013 and better \u2013 toilets is no mere case of urban planning. For Zhang, toilets are politics. They are poetry. They are art. In 1994, the then 29-year-old recorded his performance piece 12 Square Metres on black and white film. To mimic the putrefying conditions in Chinese toilets Zhang sat naked, his head shaved, in a prison-like space. Caked in fish oil and honey he waited for the flies to feed. They crawled into his mouth, up his nose, into his ears and his eyes. For one hour exactly Zhang remained still. Then he stood up, walked slowly to a nearby pond, and submerged himself.  \u201cThat toilet was my life,\u201d recalls Zhang, noting the poverty of his childhood in rural Henan province and the sparseness of his digs in an artists\u2019 community on Beijing\u2019s outskirts in the 1990s. Public toilets swarmed with shit and flies. Indoor plumbing was then, and remains for many today, a luxury. For Zhang, however, times have changed. He is now an internationally renowned artist who has been represented by Pace Gallery, New York, since 2007. He employs more than 100 full-time assistants (during busy periods this can rise to 200) who churn out industrial-sized artworks in his 75,000 square foot Shanghai studio. He continues to surprise, moving from painting to performance to sculpture. This week Zhang is in Australia to promote Sydney Buddha, his majestic ode to eastern spirituality. Standing over five metres tall in Carriageworks\u2019 cavernous central hall, it is his largest installation in Australia to date.  Two Buddhas, representing permanence and transience, face each other. One, a hollow aluminum mould, shimmers in beams of sunlight. Its tranquil head lies severed at its feet. The second buddha is a casting of the first\u2019s interior and is created from 20 tonnes of incense ash sourced from Shanghai temples. As time passes, it will eventually crumble.  \u201cFor me [the ash] is souls,\u201d explains Zhang, sitting next to his creation and opening his palms in a gesture of prayer. \u201cThis is my Buddha flying here to bless the people and the city.\u201d Otherworldly, maybe. But Zhang, who is taut and wiry with an open unlined face far more youthful than his 50 years, is also funny and humble. For the launch he is dressed entirely in shades of grey, from his hiking shoes to his cap to his grey polo shirt, the collar upturned. There are traces of the grace and physical poise that made his performance pieces as a young man beautiful: as he talks, he sits bolt upright, sometimes resting his toes on pointe like a ballet dancer. Zhang was born Dong Ming, meaning \u201ceastern brightness\u201d, in 1965 to factory-worker parents a year before the cultural revolution erupted. Embarrassed by his revolutionary name (an homage to Chairman Mao) he changed it when he moved to Beijing in the 1990s to study at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. There, living with other poor migrants and artists, he created angst-ridden performance pieces that brimmed with pain and a meditative masochism. That Zhang \u2013 the rebellious, dirty, daring artist who hung naked from the ceiling of his studio, suspended in chains, with his blood dripping on to a pan below where it slowly cooked \u2013 is gone.     Sydney Buddha at Carriageworks. Photograph: Susannah Wimberley    Buddhism provides a link. In his previous works Zhang emulated the mental fortitude that monks seek by enduring extreme physical tests. The art, to many, seemed perplexing and subversive. He says his parents thought it \u201cdangerous and that I was mad\u201d and that for a long time they had no idea what he did. In 2014 a program about him that aired on the Discovery Channel in Asia was banned in China \u201cbecause some people cannot accept it\u201d. Zhang only rediscovered Buddhism as a full way of life when he moved back to Shanghai from New York in 2006 after eight years living in the US. Now it informs everything: from the tools he uses, including ash, to the subjects he sculpts. He sees his task to help promote president Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cChinese dream\u201d. Zhang insists: \u201cWe have to revive all our traditional ancestors\u2019 culture and art.\u201d  Savvy, and commercially viable, Zhang has ridden the wave of the Chinese art boom. (It has no signs of slowing down: he is designing a flagship store-cum-art gallery for a Chinese diamond company.) Embracing this side of things has inevitably led to a dulling of his edge. Zhang recently packed his teenage son off to a London boarding school with the advice: help others, study hard and \u201cavoid traffic, sex, girlfriends and drugs\u201d. Back in Carriageworks, the disintegrating ash Buddha, surrounded by swirls of incense, is a reminder of Zhang\u2019s own fluidity and fortune. \u201cI always believed in the traditional Chinese doctrine: that you keep changing and this is the rule of the universe,\u201d asserts the artist. \u201cI feel I am so lucky to change from a mad man to a man with good food and a family man, to have my children. I feel that Buddhism has blessed me.\u201d Zhang is carefully weighing up how to spend his next 30 years \u2013 and how to stretch them out to feel like 300. One idea is to abandon art to become a monk; another is to spend 10 years doing 10 exhibitions in 10 of the world\u2019s most important museums. Another is to become mayor. Because, as Zhang notes, there is a lot to do. While New York snoozes, \u201cChina never sleeps.\u201d \u2022 Sydney Buddha is at Carriageworks until 15 March.

Beijing has blamed a number of attacks, which include market bombings, riots, sieges of police and government offices, on religious extremism and the influence of pernicious foreign groups. Uighur groups abroad frequently describe them as a desperate stand against religious and cultural repression.  Police apprehended the suspects at the Shanghai Pudong airport as they attempted to leave China, some of them bound for Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to the newspaper. One of the suspects had \u201crepeatedly broadcast audio and visual materials to incite ethnic hatred and ethnic prejudice,\u201d it said. Michael Clarke, a Xinjiang expert at Griffith University in Australia, said that if the report is true, the arrests would mark an unprecedented case of China arresting foreign nationals in connection with Xinjiang-related violence.  \u201cTurkey, for the Uighurs, has long been seen as a clear cultural connection, linguistically and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s ideological sympathy as well for the Uighurs from Turkey. But I haven\u2019t seen evidence before that Turkish nationals were travelling to China to support Uighurs within Xinjiang. \u201cOne big question is, how will this affect China\u2019s relationship with Turkey itself?

In March 2014, Thai authorities detained more than 200 Uighurs at a human smuggling camp. Many of them purported to be Turkish, and some claimed to seek political asylum. In September, Indonesian police arrested four Uighurs, also on Turkish passports; police said that they planned to meet an Indonesian jihadi with ties to Isis. Details of the case remain murky. In October, Malaysian police detained 155 Uighurs crammed into two tiny apartments in Kuala Lumpur.  On Monday, Chinese police shot and killed six people in Xinjiang as they attempted to detonate explosives, state media reported. One man attempted to charge police with an axe.

At about the same time, halfway around the world, the city of Angkor was being founded. It would be the grand capital of the Khmer kingdom for six centuries before itself being abandoned. The only contemporary account we have of Angkor is from a Chinese diplomat, Zhou Daguan, who arrived in 1296 and stayed almost a year. He tells us that the new temple of Bayon (all stone in what remains now, but still spectacular) had a gold tower, eight gold Buddhas, and a golden bridge flanked by gold lions leading to it. He writes of grand royal processions and firework displays, of a society with many slaves, open-air marketplaces with women vendors, and houses built of bamboo and thatch. Angkor, the most extensive urban settlement of pre-industrial times, is now an archaeological park in northwestern Cambodia. Buses and trishaws ferry tourists between the ruins of some of the largest and most elaborate Hindu and Buddhist temples ever built. Some are only heaps of laterite blocks, but many are still astonishing: the towering lotus buds of Angkor Wat, the haunting Ta Prohm, in the clutches of time and strangler figs. Only recently have we begun to piece together how this and other ancient cities thrived and declined \u2013 their stories offer some intriguing lessons for cities today.     Modern analysis has shown the true extent of Angkor, the most extensive urban settlement of pre-industrial times. Photograph: Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty Images    The true scale of Angkor as an urban settlement began to be confirmed around 20 years ago. The size and number of its temples turned out to be matched by the extent of the city around them. It was spread out over around 1,000 square kilometres \u2013 composed of temple complexes, large residential clusters and paddy fields irrigated by a canny network of reservoirs, canals, ponds and embankments. At Angkor\u2019s peak, in the 12th and 13th centuries, some three quarters of a million people lived there. Angkor \u2013 a name thought to be derived from \u201cnagara\u201d, the Sanskrit for \u201ccity\u201d \u2013 was a low-density urban settlement, its population spread out owing to agricultural land being part of the city. This was a pattern of urbanism found in several ancient metropolises, including the Mayan cities of central America, and Sri Lankan cities such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. These cities all went into decline relatively soon after attaining their prime. Angkor was flourishing in the late 13th century when Zhou Daguan visited; a little over a century later, it was all but abandoned. Researchers are beginning to see similarities in how these ancient low-density cities failed \u2013 and this is of particular interest today because, even as our cities grow in extent and population, their densities are falling. \u201cAlmost all cities are dropping to extremely low density,\u201d says Roland Fletcher, professor of theoretical and world archaeology at the University of Sydney. \u201cFor example, the middle of New York may be very crowded, but Greater New York is a vast, sprawling landscape with huge amounts of open land which are never out of sight of buildings.\u201d  A similar pattern repeats with Greater Shanghai, Greater Tokyo, and the larger American and European agglomerations. The phenomenon of urban sprawl has largely been seen as a consequence of industrialised urbanisation: the availability of cars, outrageous real estate prices close to city centres, suburban aspirations of the middle class. But as Fletcher points out, there is nothing new about low-density cities. He recalls delivering a talk in 1996 about pre-industrial cities at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. Someone asked him at the end of his talk if he\u2019d seen radar imagery of Angkor taken from the space shuttle Endeavour. Fletcher had the image within a week, and the first thing he noticed was something that had been speculated to exist \u2013 \u201cthis whacking great canal coming down from the north\u201d. The area with the temples proved to be just the centre of Angkor: \u201cThere were lines and patches and tanks and features all over the place. The immediate revelation was that this place was huge.\u201d     Monks in Angkor\u2019s Ta Prohm temple. Photograph: Alamy    Fletcher went to Cambodia in 1998 where he met Christophe Pottier of the \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Extr\u00eame-Orient, riding around on a motorcyle to map Angkor. When Pottier pulled out his maps, says Fletcher, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know what it was, you\u2019d think it was a Mayan city.\u201d The pair teamed up to form the Greater Angkor Project, a Cambodian-French-Australian initiative that aimed to produce a detailed map of greater Angkor and investigate the reasons for its demise. They used high-altitude remote sensing technology to find urban forms concealed by forest cover, and conducted surveys and ground excavations.  There had long been a debate about what led to the decline of Angkor and the southward move of the Khmer seat of power. Proposed explanations included the strain on theocratic rule of Hindu-Buddhist jostling; attacks by Thai armies; and changes brought about by maritime trade. But the Greater Angkor Project added a significant new possibility: extreme climate instability. Analysis of tree rings in neighbouring Vietnam showed long periods of droughts followed by periods of unusually wet monsoons in the 14th and 15th centuries.     A remote sensing image of Angkor reveals how much of the surrounding city lies hidden.  Photograph: Damian Evans/Khmer Archaeology LiDAR Consortium    The upheaval caused by flooding during mega-monsoons is clearly visible in remote sensing images produced by the project: erosion channels show rapidly moving water breaching a dam, crashing into the wall of a reservoir, then tearing away the edge of a residential area, flowing at a high level through housing, and later damaging a bridge. Perhaps the scenes in Angkor were not very different from those seen in recent years in New Orleans or Fukushima. Sand accumulated in Angkor\u2019s canals, and parts of the water network were cut off from each other. Damage to an old, complex water management system meant the city became less resilient in intervening periods of drought. Angkor, with its large population and broken infrastructure, would have found it hard to sustain itself. The pattern of urbanism at Angkor was hardly unique: the Mayan cities that Pottier\u2019s maps of Angkor reminded Fletcher of have long been recognised as low-density agrarian settlements. The lack of the wheel and the absence of draught animals meant that large quantities of food could not be transported, and cities had to be largely self-sufficient, growing maize, varieties of beans, squash, manioc and other staples of the region.  The city of Tikal, in present-day Guatemala, was one of the most important of these Mayan centres. In what is called its Late Classic Period, around 600 AD, there was a flowering of art and architecture: large plazas, palaces, pyramid temples, sculpture and painted ceramics (of the many structures still found in Tikal, a 65-metre high pyramid is one of the tallest man-made structures in all pre-Columbian America). Conservative estimates put the city\u2019s population at around 45,000 during this period; the city extended over 160 square kilometres. Then, in the middle of the ninth century, Tikal collapsed. Just how a large population was sustained, and then came undone, in the middle of a rainforest has been reconstructed in recent inter-disciplinary work by a team of researchers from Mexico, Guatemala and the United States. David L Lentz, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cincinnati, says: \u201cWe now have empirical data to tell you what the landscape looked like.\u201d     The Mayan city of Tikal was abandoned in the ninth century. \u2018Tikal serves as an excellent model of us today because we\u2019re following the same trajectory,\u2019 says David Lentz. Photograph: Getty Images    Originally, the area of Tikal was around 70% upland tropical rainforest, and the rest swampy wetland. An extended family would build their houses in a cluster, with cultivable land attached. In all, the people of Tikal cleared around two-thirds of the rainforest to create their monuments and homes, and to fuel their fires. \u201cIn many ways they were managing the forest very effectively,\u201d says Lentz. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t aware that cutting down a forest reduces the amount of precipitation in the region. Then suddenly a horrible drought comes along, and they can\u2019t figure out why they can\u2019t supplicate their gods adequately to prevent it.\u201d It didn\u2019t help that Tikal\u2019s water management system had become increasingly reliant on collecting rainwater in reservoirs, at the cost of groundwater. \u201cAs Tikal grew and grew,\u201d Lentz says, \u201cthey created all these pavements around the city, from which they\u2019d divert water to the reservoirs. But this cut off the recharge capacity of the springs. When there was no longer any rainfall to fill up their reservoirs, the springs had dried up too.\u201d For centuries, the Maya at Tikal had been erecting stelae \u2013 upright stone slabs with hieroglyphs and depictions of gods and rulers. The last one is dated 869. Soon after, there are signs of what might today be called urban decay, with palaces being occupied by squatters. Charred, gnawed human bones from this late period suggest desperate times. Then, the city went quiet. Tikal\u2019s over-use of forested land ended up exacerbating the drought in the ninth century, and their construction compromised the city\u2019s back-up source of water. Both are familiar refrains from analyses of cities today. \u201cThey did at least two things that changed their environment in significant ways,\u201d Lentz says. \u201cThis ultimately led to their demise. In the big picture, Tikal serves as an excellent model of us today, because we\u2019re following the same trajectory.\u201d  Tikal had a population explosion in the seventh century and continued to adapt. \u201cBut they ran all of the resilience out of the landscape. Then, when the rains didn\u2019t come, they had no way to respond and the whole thing collapsed.\u201d  Lentz draws a comparison with a neighbouring city called El Zotz, which had a smaller population, which didn\u2019t modify its landscape as drastically, and was thus able to survive the drought that felled Tikal.     Temple 1 and the palace from Temple 5 at Tikal. As drought struck, temples were occupied by squatters; gnawed human bones suggest desperate times.  Photograph: David Lentz    In the ancient world, low-density cities were prone to episodes of collapse. But back then, only a minuscule fraction of the world\u2019s population lived in cities. According to Fletcher: \u201cIt\u2019s now generally reckoned that 50% of humankind lives in cities, a lot of which are relatively low density. In less than 200 years we\u2019ve created a physical situation for millions and millions of human beings that has never existed before. It\u2019s completely unprecedented. We should probably take a fairly hard look at it.\u201d Tikal, Angkor and Anuradhapura (which foundered in the 10th century after thriving for more than a millennium) were very different cities in their geography, environment and social and political functioning. But, Fletcher points out, they all had operational similarities: extensive land clearance, sprawling low-density settlement patterns, massive infrastructure \u2013 all of which are attributes of modern cities. The extended infrastructure of Angkor and Tikal proved vulnerable to a changing climate, something else that may be upon us. \u201cWhatever the cause of climate change, we\u2019re in it,\u201d says Fletcher. \u201cAnd this fluctuation is getting serious.\u201d He points out that events like the flooding of New Orleans have resonances with Angkor: \u201cBoth cities had developed a fantastic method of managing water. But if the impact that comes is outside the parameters of the system, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d ", "tags": ["Cities", "Urbanisation", "Cambodia", "Cambodia holidays", "Asia", "Asia Pacific", "Angkor Wat holidays"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-14T10:14:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/15/foreign-investors-buy-80-per-cent-developments", "sentences": ["Barratt\u2019s application is one of dozens of new high-rise housing developments planned along the banks of the Thames and the trend has invited unfavourable comparisons with high rise proliferation in Shanghai and Dubai."], "title": "Foreign investors buy 80% of homes in Thameside developments", "article": "Foreign purchasers have bought 80% of the homes in a series of major new Thameside housing developments in the latest sign that struggling London homebuyers are being squeezed out by wealthy international investors. A quarter of properties bought in the four developments were taken by buyers from the far east and around 20% from the Middle East, according to the leading estate agent Knight Frank. The agent also revealed that 40% of all the homes in the schemes were sold to investors. The sales data will dismay campaigners for more affordable housing for Londoners who complain they are being priced out of living in the capital. But it is seen as good news by the estate agency which has quoted it approvingly in a marketing brochure aimed at persuading developers to invest in a similar project, the proposed 291 luxury apartment scheme at Vauxhall Cross, on the south side of the Thames. The sales pitch for the Vauxhall development says London is \u201cwidely regarded as the \u2018gold bullion\u2019 of international property markets\u201d and boasts that returns on property in the area have been \u201cbetter than \u2026 the FTSE 100 and gold\u201d. Knight Frank declined to name the four schemes which were largely acquired by foreign buyers. But they are thought to be similar in size and standard to the proposed Vauxhall Cross scheme. Knight Frank focuses on prime property in some of the most desirable riverside areas of the capital such as Vauxhall, Chelsea and Tower Bridge. The purchase figures emerged amid signs of a growing backlash against developers targeting foreign investors rather than providing affordable homes. Last week, Berkeley Group PLC, one of the UK\u2019s largest house builders, unveiled a new marketing drive for apartments in a planned 50-storey tower by Blackfriars Bridge where the cheapest home is being sold for \u00a31.15m and the most expensive is available for \u00a323m. A promotional video aimed at foreign buyers had to be taken down almost immediately after it was attacked on Twitter as \u201cnauseating\u201d and \u201cabsolutely revolting\u201d. It showed a buyer flying into London on a private jet, driving to the skyscraper in a Bentley and buying an apartment as a surprise gift for his girlfriend as if it was a piece of \u201ccurving glass sculpture\u201d. The four-minute film showed the man and his wife sipping champagne in the Tate Modern before the man sent his wife for a swim in the rooftop pool, bought the property and presented her with the home as a gift. \u201cWe have removed the video,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Berkeley Group, who otherwise declined to elaborate on the contents of the film. \u201cWe are not making any comment on that.\u201d London Mayor Boris Johnson has admitted that London is suffering \u201ca desperate shortage of homes\u201d and last year warned: \u201cLondon homes aren\u2019t some kind of new global asset class. They aren\u2019t just blocks of bullion in the sky.\u201d After several London developments were marketed first in Hong Kong and Singapore before being promoted in the capital he has asked developers halt the practice. Tom Copley, Labour\u2019s housing spokesman on the London Assembly, said the 80% foreign sales revealed by Knight Frank showed the mayor\u2019s policy was \u201cclearly failing\u201d. \u201cThe fact that only a fifth of these developments are bought by domestic buyers highlights the extent to which the needs of people who live here and contribute towards the success of this city \u2013 no matter where they are from originally \u2013 are not being met by London\u2019s housing market,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only is the mayor\u2019s agreement woefully inadequate, but some of the developers that have signed up to it appear to be ignoring it.\u201d A spokesman for Knight Frank said the very high level of foreign investment related to \u201ca narrow percentage of the market and in the total market across London it is a much smaller proportion\u201d. Property industry sources have also claimed that foreign sales of homes are now slowing compared to the boom period of 2012. In a further sign that some new London developments are not meeting affordability targets, Barratt Homes has this month submitted an application to build a 28-storey tower of 135 apartments close to Battersea heliport of which just 14 of which are classed as \u201caffordable\u201d. Wandsworth is facing an annual shortfall of 1,586 affordable homes and the council\u2019s policy is that at least one in three new-build homes should be for social rent, intermediate rent or shared ownership. However, Barratt claimed in a planning statement to support the application that this was \u201cthe maximum reasonable level supported by this scheme\u201d. Asked why the level was so low a spokesman claimed the scheme \u201cwill set a new standard of design innovation and quality\u201d. Barratt\u2019s application is one of dozens of new high-rise housing developments planned along the banks of the Thames and the trend has invited unfavourable comparisons with high rise proliferation in Shanghai and Dubai.

For instance, I immediately recognised the first shot of London in 1927 in Colour as being taken from much the same vantage point you could obtain today by sitting on the top deck of the 188 bus. But the economy and life lived in the area has transformed, with the warehouses and cranes replaced with office blocks and luxury flats (the Shard would only just be out of shot).  What makes a lot of this footage so compelling is the leisurely way it is shot, frequently by mounting a camera on the top of a bus or tram: simple, easy and panoramic, the film you could have made had you taken your cameraphone on top of the 188 bus in 1927. With many silent clips, the lack of newsreel-style voiceover also induces a certain dreaminess. Nankin Road, Shanghai (1901)            An inhabitant of the Puxi side of the Haungpu river, rather than the south side of the Thames, couldn\u2019t have the same reaction in watching Nankin Road, Shanghai, 1901. This view of a main street in the city\u2019s British-administered International Settlement reveals a great density of Chinese shop signs and many more people on the streets than in most London footage. There\u2019s the odd bicycle or horse and cart, but mostly the traffic is rickshaws, long before their recent, semi-ironic revival in western capitals. Men run along the street carrying other \u2013 often European \u2013 men on their backs. At the end, a platoon of Gurkhas patrols the street, flanked by two less disciplined-looking, fag-smoking British officers. Nothing of this landscape survives in today\u2019s high-rise, neon-bedecked Nanjing Road, and few could seriously miss it. Liverpool overhead railway (1950s)            Contrasts of the urban past and present formed the basis for an installation project by the filmmaker Patrick Keiller, The City of the Future, where archival footage \u2013 mostly from Mitchell and Kenyon, mostly from the top of buses and trams \u2013 juxtaposed with shots of the same places in the 21st century prove a seemingly counter-intuitive point. The vast majority of the British streets (if not those in the \u201ccolonies\u201d) were basically unchanged, but for the fact that the people therein were a bit healthier and fatter, and the buildings less sooty but more dilapidated. The \u201ccity of the future\u201d envisaged by the likes of HG Wells happened only in pockets, at least in the places tracked by these films.  It\u2019s the opposite approach to that of Terence Davies\u2019 acclaimed Of Time and the City, where similar footage was marshalled into a much more pessimistic depiction of a British city that had allegedly prostituted its grandeur for an inept modernisation. Much of Davies\u2019 film hinged on thrilling shots from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, a rapid transit system unforgivably demolished and replaced with a dual carriageway in the 1950s. Even then, however, as this other footage from the overhead railway shows, the main thing missing from the same view today is industry, not buildings. Havana, Cuba (1930s)            Another sense of \u201cnon-change\u201d is provided by this popular clip of Havana, filmed by the travelogue-maker Andr\u00e9 de la Varre in a similar laconic, drifting style to Mitchell and Kenyon or Friese-Greene. The view of this magnificent, colonial city could probably be recreated shot-for-shot, building for building today, bar the monuments to the US army. However, the dilapidation of the Cuban capital now would contrast with the bourgeois elegance on show in these eight minutes. If only, the viewer might wonder, the revolution hadn\u2019t happened, then maybe Havana would be like Miami by now! The advance from a ferociously unequal mafia capital to a country with the highest life expectancy in the region is not easy to register via panoramic shots of monumental architecture and busy streets. Warsaw (1955)            What, though, about cities that weren\u2019t mostly left alone (as in Britain or Cuba), or that didn\u2019t redevelop themselves to the point of unrecognisability (as in China), but which were destroyed? The Polish capital Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Wehrmacht in 1944 after their suppression of the Warsaw Rising. The response from the post-war government was to rebuild the historic Old and New Town, partly via a meticulous study of Canaletto paintings, rather than from available pre-war footage of what had by then become a rather dilapidated and commercialised area. This can be seen in this charming 1955 city short: Niedzielny Poranek (Sunday Morning) by Andrzej Munk. Though semi-fictional, centred on the flirtations of the city\u2019s public transport staff (meaning a lot of good shots from moving buses), it does what it was intended to do in showcasing the romance and success of the reconstruction. However, the city\u2019s 19th-century commercial areas were not reconstructed, and it\u2019s this absence that forms the basis of a rather extraordinary essay in imaginary reconstruction, the short film Warszawa 1935 ... Warsaw reconstructed (1935)            There is decent real footage of the pre-war city, such as the clip Pre-war Warsaw in Colour, which gives a view of the city in 1939 with the usual sorts of views \u2013 parks, \u201cpicturesque\u201d residents (here, Orthodox Jews) and grand neoclassical buildings. However, this partial and fragmented picture was not enough for the makers of Warszawa 1935, who created a film that had never actually been made about the city on the eve of its destruction \u2013 pieced together in its absence through animation and meticulous architectural reconstruction. The result is thorough and architecturally precise, if somewhat sentimental with its sweeping perspectives and elegaic music. But this 3D spectacular rings remarkably hollow. It is an attempt to prove that what contemporaries saw as a tense, impoverished city ruled by a military dictatorship was actually a successful capitalist metropolis \u2013 a retrospective CGI ad for a 1930s property developer, with the same creepy purple skies as architectural renders.  No city could ever have been this coherent, this clean, this elegant. Claiming Warsaw as a \u201cParis of the East\u201d, it makes the actual Paris of 1935 \u2013 available in clips such as Paris, the Beautiful 1930s - look positively squalid. But then the difference is that nearly every component of that Paris still exists, so you could still make that film today.

Related: Kim Fowley, LA music legend, dies aged 75    On the surface, Kim Fowley \u2013 who has died at the age of 75 \u2013 was an archetypal Hollywood brat. His father was a B-movie actor, his mother a Goldwyn Girl and Warner Brothers contract player; he went to school with Nancy Sinatra and James Brolin and enjoyed a brief career as a would-be delinquent in the company of Ryan O\u2019Neal. But his childhood wasn\u2019t quite as gilded as it looked.  His mother abandoned him to a foster home when she remarried. According to Fowley, admittedly not always the most reliable witness, his father rescued him so that the six-year-old might act as a lookout when he was scoring opium, and he helped his dad procure women at Sunset Strip clubs: \u201cI would go up to a girl and I\u2019d say \u2018Could I talk to you, pretty lady?\u2019 \u2018Oh, what a cute little boy!\u2019,\u201d he told the journalist Michael Walker, \u201cand then I\u2019d take off and he\u2019d move right in\u201d. His father abandoned him again when Fowley\u2019s ever-increasing height and a limp occasioned by a bout of polio left him \u201can Ichabod Crane/Scarecrow of Oz\u201d, unable to charm potential conquests.  Forced to live on his wits, he became a petty thief and a male prostitute \u201cfor old desperate women\u201d, before spotting an opportunity in the world of rock\u2019n\u2019roll as a manager and producer: \u201cwhen you\u2019re 19 and you\u2019ve already done 13 years of opium runs with dad and been a kind of seduction advance man, you know how to talk to people.\u201d His early hits tell you a lot about the way rock\u2019n\u2019roll was viewed in the pre-Beatles 60s. They were novelty records, designed to squeeze quick money out of a fly-by-night phenomenon that might already be on its last legs, but \u2013 in what was to become something of a recurring motif in his career \u2013 they occasionally turned out rather better than you suspected Fowley had really intended. For all his cynicism, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from being genuinely entertaining.             B Bumble and the Stingers\u2019 Nut Rocker, essentially a version of Tchaikovsky\u2019s March of the Toy Soldiers from The Nutcracker, which Fowley had the chutzpah to take a writing credit for, is brilliantly, irresistibly stupid. Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow, a song he talent-scouted for the Rivingtons, became a trash-rock classic, performed by everyone from the Beach Boys to the Muppets, and given a second lease of life when it was transformed into Surfin\u2019 Bird by the Trashmen, and later covered by the Ramones and the Cramps.  The arrival of the Beatles should theoretically have meant the end for Fowley: another of his productions, the Murmaids\u2019 Popsicles and Icicles, made it to No 3 in the US in January 1964, but sounded hopelessly pass\u00e9 next to I Want to Hold Your Hand, released the same month. Instead, Fowley flourished, his career based on two skills.  One was an understanding of spectacle. He worked with PJ Proby at the height of the singer\u2019s trouser-splitting notoriety and apparently invented a deathless gig tradition when he encouraged the audience at the Toronto Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Revival to hold lit matches and lighters aloft to welcome a nervous John Lennon to the stage.             The other was a talent for spotting other people\u2019s talent. The author of Popscicles and Icicles was David Gates, later frontman of Bread; early on in their careers, he worked with the Soft Machine, Warren Zevon and Slade. More puzzling was how he parlayed that into a recording career of his own, despite possessing what his friend Michael Des Barres described as \u201cno musical ability\u201d. Even so, his releases occasionally came up trumps, almost despite themselves. His 1965 single The Trip is not only way ahead of the curve when it comes to referencing LSD in pop, it\u2019s a kind of sneering, contemptuous assault on the values of the nascent hippy movement. His 1968 album Outrageous \u2013 the record that so upset Robert Christgau \u2013 offered more ur-punk attitude (\u201cDirty, filthy, sneaky, horrible\u201d, he intoned gleefully on Animal Man, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you \u2013 are you straight?\u201d). Bubblegum had a killer garage rock riff so good it was subsequently covered by Sonic Youth. Motorboat, his 1974 glam single as Jimmy Jukebox, is flatly brilliant, a ridiculous confection of camp, ennui-laden vocals \u2013 \u201cMondo deco! Punk rock fugitive!\u201d \u2013 Duane Eddy guitars and Fowley impersonating the sound of an outboard motor. Given that it was an exercise in trashy flamboyance, outrage and chutzpah, it was no wonder Fowley understood glam perfectly: he turned up on The Old Grey Whistle Test explaining Alice Cooper, for whom he wrote. In fact, the 70s were the decade that suited him best. He was perfectly placed to tap into the early 70s obsession with nostalgia for the rock\u2019n\u2019roll era, working on the soundtrack of George Lucas\u2019s American Graffiti. As the lyrics of Animal Man and Motorboat suggested, he was on to the idea of punk before punk really existed. In 1973, he produced Jonathan Richman\u2019s visionary protopunk band the Modern Lovers; the following year, he put together the Runaways. His tenure as the manager of the all-girl band was controversial: it was Fowley that insisted on the band\u2019s \u201cjailbait\u201d image, with frontwoman Cherie Curie obliged to perform onstage in lingerie, while his desire to appear as a svengali-like figure in total control of the band made them easy to disdain by a music press never afraid to be sexist in the first place. But he co-wrote their awesome single Cherry Bomb, a record perfectly balanced on the cusp between glam and punk.             The Runaways fired him in 1977, and Fowley never quite captured the zeitgeist in the same way again. But whatever subsequently happened on the LA music scene, Fowley was frequently to be found on its fringes, being Kim Fowley. He had a stab at 80s AOR with Steel Breeze, attempted to muscle in on the Sunset Strip hair-metal scene via a band called Shanghai, dabbled in post-White Stripes garage rock with Muck and the Mires, and gained the mind-boggling credit of \u201cartistic consultant\u201d to GG Allin, a punk singer who ate his own excrement on stage.  He never lost his capacity to outrage: invited to perform at London\u2019s Dirty Water club a decade ago, he succeeded in so offending the audience that one of them grabbed the microphone from him. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are or how many great records you\u2019ve made,\u201d she shouted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just fuck off?\u201d  Fowley\u2019s response was unrecorded, but given that he described himself as \u201ca necessary evil\u201d, it seems more than likely he took it as evidence that he was doing his job.", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Punk", "Psychedelia", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-16T11:59:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/16/detroit-auto-show-stronghold-capitalist-splendour", "sentences": ["The Detroit auto show \u2013 next to the shows held throughout the year in Geneva, Paris, Frankfurt and Shanghai, among other places \u2013 is one of the largest and most significant in the industry, and is certainly the most important show for manufacturers touting their wares in the the United States and Canada."], "title": "In Detroit, the auto show is a stronghold of capitalist splendour", "article": "The North American International Auto Show, which opens to the public this weekend in Detroit, is not an event known for its subtlety.   The Detroit auto show \u2013 next to the shows held throughout the year in Geneva, Paris, Frankfurt and Shanghai, among other places \u2013 is one of the largest and most significant in the industry, and is certainly the most important show for manufacturers touting their wares in the the United States and Canada. It gives automakers a chance to display, amid great fanfare, new models and flashy concepts, a task they embrace with vigor.  At the 2010 show, Ford lowered the Atlas concept truck \u2013 a predecessor to the new F-150 pickup \u2013 from the ceiling on a steel sling. One of the more famous stunts was when Chrysler introduced the new Jeep Grand Cherokee to journalists by driving it through a plate glass window at the front of the Cobo Center. There was nothing so flashy this year in the media previews, but it was still like walking into a carnival of capitalism. The presentations feature huge, brightly lit display monitors, loud music, smoke machines, laser displays. Pyrotechnic displays are not unusual. Circus impresario PT Barnum would feel at home.  The show opens to the public today for a week, though journalists \u2013 sporting comically large pink badges and bright orange wrist bands \u2013 had an early look last week.      The Infinity Q60 concept car is displayed during the press preview at the North American International Auto Show. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images    Spectacle is a beloved tradition, and the ringmasters were all present. Automakers\u2019 chief executives were front and center in Detroit this year. That includes GM\u2019s Mary Barra; Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of both Renault and Nissan; William Clay Ford Jr, executive chairman of Ford, and Dieter Zetsche, the mustachioed chairman of Daimler, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent company. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Sergio Marchionne made it to the show, but declined playing ringmaster in favor of getting down to brass tacks on the particulars of auto industry finance at a seminar. Such capitalist splendor is matched by journalists, who are known for their rumpled everyday outfits but typically dress to the nines at these events. Most men wear suits or jackets and ties, and women wear everything from smart pantsuits to elegant dresses. A small few opt to wear comfortable clothes.  Each automaker gets its own area to tout its wares, and its showmanship is on display. Ford, for example, introduced three high performance vehicles \u2013 the F-150 Raptor, the Shelby GT350R and the GT super car \u2013 on the stage of the giant Joe Louis Arena. Like supermodels featuring a designer\u2019s new collection, all three vehicles were in the same shade of brilliant blue. An official driver drove the Shelby with Dukes of Hazzard-style panache, spinning its rear wheels and drifting the car around one end of the stage. The drivers for the offroad muscle truck and the supercar chose a more stately pace, appropriate to supermarket parking lots.  When an automaker\u2019s turn comes to strut its stuff, a crowd gathers before the stage and attention is focused in that direction. Usually, there is a countdown clock, which, as it reaches the one-minute mark, is accompanied by music that one would expect to hear at the sort of expensive nightclub that many journalists would, when not offered free entrance by an automaker, have to wait on a long line to enter. Oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss, oomp-tsss \u2026 The signal that a show has begun is usually a loud sound \u2013 music, a pyrotechnic burst, bass that causes the structural supports in the hall\u2019s ceiling to vibrate, or, sometimes, edgy guitar riffs. Each automaker has its favorite style. General Motors tends to favor rocky guitar music played at a volume that would burst eardrums if played for more than a few seconds, as well as \u2013 this year, in the case of the Bolt/Volt introduction \u2013 electrical sparking sound effects to go along with the lightning bolts streaking across large video monitors positioned around the stage. Zzzztt. Zzt. Zzzzzttt-ttssss \u2026 Like Detroit itself, these flashbang features don\u2019t always work as they should. The public address system stopped briefly, cutting off in half the room from the voice of Mary Barra, GM\u2019s chief executive, as she spoke.     A Honda product specialist demonstrates the Uni-Cub personal mobility device during media previews for the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.  Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP    With the introductory music over, these press conferences usually follow a predictable format. Someone from the company talks about how many cars and/or trucks that company has sold over the past year or years and passes the microphone to someone more important. Person B, the more important one, makes broad, sweeping statements about the company\u2019s goals, and begins to hint at what everyone\u2019s really there to see.  For example, after more or less unceremoniously introducing hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions of the Sonata, Hyundai suggested what everyone knew: the sexy stuff would be shown shortly. Cue more loud music. \u201cFor a large group of people, a pickup truck just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Dave Zuchowski, Hyundai Motor America\u2019s chief executive, just before stage hands executed a lightshow-backed veil dance with a pair of poles and the sheet that had been draped over the car to be revealed.  Then, boom. Flashing lights, more loud music and sound effects, and the Santa Cruz concept was revealed.     The Hyundai Santa Cruz crossover truck concept is unveiled during the North American International Auto Show. Photograph: Carlos Osorio/AP    With the cover thrown off of the object of everyone\u2019s attention, the presenter talks about it briefly, then invites people to come up for a closer look. That signals to the salivating horde assembled at the foot of the stage that they are now free to mob the presenters and the revealed vehicle with cameras, microphones and notepads. People jostle to get unobscured photos of the new model. The air is filled with the smells of sweat, hair gel and other odors as the crowd converges in bazaar-like fashion upon the vehicle and the presenters, who are usually asked a line of disappointingly predictable questions: How much? When\u2019s it going to be available? Is there going to be a sports/offroad/luxury/eco edition?  It\u2019s not clear how a presenter actually escapes from the scrum, but eventually, they take their leave. The crowd dissipates instantly once the press conference has ended. Little pools of humanity remain around the vehicle, taking pictures and doing video stand-ups in front of it, and explaining what has just transpired. People sit inside the cars, play with the knobs on the dash, take pictures of the infotainment screens.  It is like prom. Crowds cling to the more popular models long after the event has ended. Less popular models quickly find themselves alone. Within five or ten minutes, the same thing has begun in another part of the hall as music begins heralding the introduction of yet another model.  By the end of the day, the crowd on the show floor is thin, as most journalists have retreated to file reviews to their schlubby editors. The well-dressed women \u2013 \u201cbooth babes\u201d \u2013 hired to tend automakers\u2019 display booths stand about, chatting idly among themselves or with visitors, and occasionally posing for photos next to the cars. Once in a while, it\u2019s possible to see small teams armed with tape measures, micrometers and other evaluative tools swarming different cars and scribbling things in notebooks and smartphone notepads. These engineering treasure hunters were impossible to spot in the wilds of the show floor this year. Once the manufactured excitement of the press conference schedule is over, quiet falls upon the center. By the end of the day, only a handful a people showed up for the closing awards ceremony. Most of the chairs in front of the stage were empty as people streamed out of the building on their way to restaurants or flights that would take them home.

In a career lasting almost 60 years, Fowley created B. Bumble and the Stingers and the pioneering all-female hard-rock band the Runaways, produced artists from Gene Vincent to the Seekers and the Soft Machine to Helen Reddy, sang with the Mothers of Invention and made radio programmes with Miami Steve Van Zandt, and could claim to be on familiar terms with just about everyone who counted in the music business. Back in 1965, Bob Dylan told him to become an artist himself, and to make his own records. It was something he tried many times over the years, with a commercial failure so consistent that he came to accept his role as a backroom boy \u2013 albeit an unusually colourful and highly visible one: he was 1.96 metres (6ft 5in) tall, with a compelling gaze from eyes described by the critic Barney Hoskyns as \u201cdead blue marble\u201d. He belonged to a generation of highly intelligent and gifted but temperamentally unorthodox 1960s people who fell in love with pop music and used it as their canvas. Fowley never wanted to turn pop music into a subject for postdoctoral study. He loved its street qualities \u2013 its grime and its flash, its sleazy glamour \u2013 and when he published the first volume of his autobiography, in 2013, he called it Lord of Garbage. He was transgressive decades before the term was applied to pop. But he had great ears and a set of cultural antennae finely tuned to changing fashions. Born in Los Angeles, he was the son of the actor Douglas Fowley, who played Doc Holliday in the popular 1950s TV series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, and one of his seven wives, the actress Shelby Payne. After his mother left them, he spent some time in an orphanage. In his autobiography he claimed that his father later used him as a lookout while making drug deals and as a lure when picking up women. He attended University High School in West Los Angeles, where his classmates included Nancy Sinatra, Bruce Johnston (later a Beach Boy), Jan Berry and Dean Torrence (later to become Jan and Dean), and the actors Sandra Dee and Ryan O\u2019Neal. In 1957, having recovered from a bout of polio, he took the first step towards a career in the music business by managing and trying to get publicity for a band called the Sleepwalkers, whose members included Johnston, the drummer Sandy Nelson and, from time to time, Phil Spector. After serving an apprenticeship with various Hollywood industry figures \u2013 including the disc-jockey Alan Freed, later jailed for his role in the payola scandal \u2013 in 1960 he recorded a Coasters-style novelty song called Alley-Oop, released under the name of a non-existent group he called the Hollywood Argyles. It went to No 1 in the US pop charts. Other early hits were made with doo-wop vocal groups, including classics by the Rivingtons (Papa Oom Mow Mow, 1962) and the Paradons (Diamonds and Pearls, 1960). When he met the young songwriter David Gates (later to found the group Bread), who played him a song called Popsicles and Icicles, Fowley put together a female singing group called the Murmaids and took the resulting record to the top of the US charts. In 1962, at the suggestion of his then girlfriend, the actor Candice Bergen, he recorded Nut Rocker, a jangly piano-led instrumental based on Tchaikovsky\u2019s March of the Wooden Soldiers, from the ballet The Nutcracker. The name of the group, B. Bumble and the Stingers, concealed the identities of Hollywood session men, including the pianist Al Hazan. The record enjoyed its biggest success in Britain, where it topped the charts after getting past a BBC screening committee that had hitherto denied airtime to parodies of classical music, but which on this occasion softened, reporting that \u201cin our opinion it will not offend reasonable people\u201d. A desire to offend reasonable people was a strong part of Fowley\u2019s make-up, and in 1963, making a six-month visit to check out the London scene, he teamed up with PJ Proby, another refugee from Hollywood, whose on-stage trouser-splitting antics quickly became notorious. A further visit to London saw him producing a group called the \u2019N Betweens (later to become Slade, but then specialising in Motown covers), one side of the Soft Machine\u2019s first single, the Seekers\u2019 Emerald City, and the Hellions, who included Dave Mason and Jim Capaldi, future members of Traffic. Back in Los Angeles, he set up House for Homeless Groups, providing a pre-fame refuge for Jim Morrison, Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night. Adjusting to the psychedelic revolution, he produced the Seeds\u2019 Falling Off the Edge of My Mind (1968) and sang on the Fraternity of Man\u2019s Don\u2019t Bogart Me (1968). He supervised Gene Vincent\u2019s comeback album in 1969 and had songs to which he contributed lyrics recorded by the Byrds and the Sir Douglas Quintet. He worked with the Modern Lovers and the Finnish group Wigwam, and with Flash Cadillac and the Continental Kids on songs for George Lucas\u2019s film American Graffiti (1973). Introducing John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band at a festival in Toronto in 1969, and knowing that Lennon was experiencing a bout of anxiety at the prospect of facing a crowd of 20,000 with a new band, Fowley invited the audience to welcome the musicians by striking matches or holding up lighters \u2013 the first recorded instance of what would become a rock and roll tradition. In 1975 he met a young guitarist called Joan Jett, around whom he formed an all-female group, a long-held ambition. Completed by Lita Ford, Cherie Currie and Jackie Fox, they were called the Runaways. Their relationship was not always smooth \u2013 he would be accused of exploiting them in various ways \u2013 but he worked with them for the next 12 years and wrote the lyric for Cherry Bomb, their classic 1976 pre-punk single. In a feature film based on Currie\u2019s published memoir of the group, released in 2010 and titled The Runaways, he was played by Michael Shannon, with Kristen Stewart playing Jett.

The surge is likelyto have spooked regulators, who are keenly aware of the risks posed to a highly leveraged financial system. The CSRC also said that it would closely supervise entrusted lending, a type of shadow banking that often serves as a back door for margin lending. \u201cRegulators are concerned that shares have run too hard, too fast,\u201d Hao Hong, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Bocom International Holdings told Bloomberg. \u201cThey want a measured increase in the stock market.

A chance to reach the semi-finals awaits Alain Perrin\u2019s side when they play hosts Australia in Brisbane on Thursday night, a scenario that was barely conceivable before the tournament began.  Some in the million strong Australian Chinese community had disconnected from the national football team, unable to endure their downward spiral since making the final of the 2004 Asian Cup. An 8-0 humiliation at the hands of Brazil in 2012 represented an unprecedented low point and, for many, the last straw. China had missed qualification for the last two Asian Cups and won only two of their six qualifying games to get to the 2015 edition. Perennial underachievers, their Fifa ranking had plummeted to 96 from a high of 37 in 2008. Their qualification for the Asian Cup 2015 was a near disaster, but results went their way on the final matchday and by the skin of their teeth, they slunk in the back door to Australia. Expectations had never been lower. Three months out from the start of the tournament I was invited to a press conference in a hotel in Brisbane hosted by Michael Ma, an AFC Asian Cup Community Ambassador. Ma leads the peak Queensland Chinese community organisation and in response to slow ticket sales for China\u2019s two games in Brisbane, he had invited the local Chinese media and community organisations to rally for the cause. Part of the event involved an Asian Cup trivia quiz where the crowd was asked a mix of historical and topical questions about Chinese football. Ten Asian Cup hats were up for grabs. Questions such as \u201cwho is China\u2019s highest all time goalscorer?\u201d were met with awkward silences. After a few more unanswered questions the session descended into comedy. The hats were eventually given away. Ma explained, \u201cWe have had too much pain from following China, we have had to look away and now we don\u2019t know the answers to these questions. From today we move forward and give the new young guys a go. We will read and learn about them and give them 100% support.\u201d The crowd vigorously mumbled in unison, wanting to believe. But the draw was not overly kind, and China were pitted in Group B with heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan, and North Korea. A good start against the Saudis in Brisbane was vital and at least Team China could rely on strong local backing \u2013 after three months effort, Ma and his team\u2019s tireless marketing culminated in a big and vocal crowd. The faith of those inside the stadium was rewarded with a moment of magic that will resonate through the ages. Just before facing a penalty, Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei asked Stephen White, a local ball boy standing behind the goal, which way he should dive. Stephen said dive left, and we all know what happened next. One of the most extraordinary cross-cultural exchanges in the history of sport had unfolded on the pitch and the youngster became the darling of 1.3 billion people after China went on to win 1-0.           Link to video: Brisbane ball boy says he is now \u2018very famous in China\u2019     Ahead of the second game against Uzbekistan, also in Brisbane, I ran into Ralph Yan, a softly-spoken, football-mad reporter for a Chinese Christian newspaper in Melbourne. After some pleasantries I asked if he would be happy with a draw with the White Wolves after the victory over Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe will win convincingly,\u201d came the reply. I was taken aback by his confidence. I probed further. \u201cYou haven\u2019t beaten Uzbekistan in 10 years, they are ranked 25 places higher than you. Do you know something I don\u2019t, Ralph?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Evergrande factor,\u201d he whispered, as if passing on a family secret. Most of the Chinese team play for Guangzhou Evergrande, the former Asian champions and Asia\u2019s first superclub. Their academy in Guangzhou is 167 acres of football paradise, boasting 50 pitches, 2,300 students and 24 foreign coaches.  Ralph believed that the high number of Guangzhou players in the team gives China a chemistry far superior than other teams thrown together from disparate lands. Bayern Munich have performed a similar role for Germany, with great success, so why not Guangzhou for China? The night of the match was sticky and humid and an even bigger Chinese crowd was in attendance at Brisbane Stadium, despite it being a Tuesday night.   Related: Asian Cup: few criticisms after successful group stage | John Duerden    Confidence was high. I sparked a conversation up with Ye from Shanghai. He was tall and meaty, his face painted red, and he was bursting out of his red \u201cGo China\u201d T-shirt. He had been previously been a student in Australia and flown back especially for the Asian Cup. \u201cNo draw. No tight game. We will be too strong,\u201d he beamed. Uzbekistan scored first and it looked like that confidence was misplaced. But China roared back and scored twice, including a brilliant strike from substitute Sun Ke as the Uzbeks wilted like an orchid in Brisbane\u2019s tropical humidity.  With qualification in the bag, a flotilla of Chinese fans sped down the Hume Highway from Sydney to Canberra for their team\u2019s final pool match against old friend North Korea. The match was a sell-out and the army of fans who had poured into the stadium went sent into early delirium as Sun struck again, this time within 90 seconds of kick-off.  I sat next to Lin Zu who is an Asian Cup Community Ambassador and writes content for a Sydney Chinese website. I asked her what the difference was between this team and other Chinese teams. \u201cBefore, they bring me much shame,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this team is young with no fear. It is very exciting. They are new China.\u201d Sun scored a second to prompt a Mexican wave around the stadium as Lin\u2019s media accomplice Ste Lin shared a theory with me: French coach Perrin was the difference. He is calm and understands the Chinese ways. \u201cAfter winning the top medals in Beijing Olympics we have big expectations for our football team,\u201d Ste said. \u201cWith a good coach like Perrin, we can now believe.\u201d The game ended 2-1 and China topped the group, undefeated without a point dropped \u2013 and real reason to believe. Next up are the Socceroos, again in Brisbane, in front of what will be a thronging crowd of red and yellow. Australia face their number one trade, tourism and education partner but that will mean nothing for 90 minutes in what is arguably the biggest match ever played between the two countries.  Australia has the edge with a 5-4 historical record, but the dragon has awoken and if not careful the Socceroos may feel the flames.", "tags": ["Asian Cup 2015", "China", "Football", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-22T01:47:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/23/middlesbrough-manchester-city-memories-fa-cup", "sentences": ["The former England coach is managing Shanghai in the Chinese Super League."], "title": "When Middlesbrough left Manchester City on dark side of the blue moon | Louise Taylor", "article": "The chant was inspired by Pink Floyd. \u201cWe don\u2019t need no Phil Scolari, we don\u2019t need no Mourinho; hey Thaksin, leave our Sven alone,\u201d chorused the Manchester City supporters to the tune of Another Brick in the Wall. Beneath a bright Teesside sun the Riverside Stadium\u2019s away end were urging Thaksin Shinawatra, City\u2019s Thai owner, not to sack Sven-Goran Eriksson. As football protest songs go it can rarely have been bettered but 11 May 2008 was not City\u2019s day. Lacking even a semblance of their fans\u2019 defiance, they concluded the season by surrendering 8-1 to Gareth Southgate\u2019s Middlesbrough.  Almost seven years on, and having taken somewhat divergent paths, the teams reconvene in FA Cup fourth round combat at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Remarkably, Joe Hart, an unused substitute during what was to prove Eriksson\u2019s final game in charge before his replacement by Mark Hughes, is the only player involved in 2008 still at either club. Driven by globalisation, the pace of change has been so radical and so rapid that, in many ways, the whole extraordinary match almost feels part of a much earlier era. Although a few of the principal players remain household names, others are earning livings in the Middle East and Asia while several are no longer professional footballers. City began unravelling when Richard Dunne was sent off for fouling Tuncay and Stewart Downing converted the resulting penalty. Suitably encouraged, Afonso Alves began teasing those Teessiders who had dismissed him as a \u00a312m Brazilian misfit by shooting the first goal of a technically accomplished hat-trick. Downing\u2019s sublime volley dispatched with the outside of his left boot boosted the scoreline, Alves registered a second and, courtesy of a deflection, the substitute Adam Johnson got in on the scoring act. F\u00e1bio Rochemback\u2019s vicious, high-velocity, free-kick preceded J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re\u2019s low shot and, after Elano claimed City\u2019s consolation, Alves completed that treble. It revived memories of the previous month when Boro\u2019s record buy had deconstructed Rio Ferdinand while scoring twice against Manchester United but such cameos were to prove cruel chimeras.   Related: FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekend    Alves, recruited from Heerenveen, would score only four league goals as Boro were relegated the following season. With his wages a millstone, the striker moved onto Qatar where he represented a handful of clubs before dropping out of the game in 2013. Another Brazilian, Elano, had been the early star of a season which, bolstered by Eriksson\u2019s appointment and the acquisition of overseas imports (many sourced by Graham Carr, now Newcastle United\u2019s chief scout), promised a top-five City finish. A collision with a mid-winter wall saw them limp to the Riverside en route to finishing ninth. Even so, the dramatic capitulation to a team four places below them suggested they had already adopted the languor demanded by the 40C temperatures awaiting on assorted holidays in Dubai and Las Vegas the following week. \u201cWhen you lose like this it\u2019s awful,\u201d Eriksson said. \u201cMentally we had nothing left. We were not even on the pitch \u2013 the team had totally gone. It was embarrassing for everyone. I\u2019m living in the unsecure and it\u2019s not very nice.\u201d Greater embarrassment was to come later that summer when Garry Cook, City\u2019s then chief executive, described Shinawatra \u2013 a former Thai prime minister with a less than impeccable human rights record \u2013 as \u201ca great guy to play golf with\u201d. Coincidentally, Steve Gibson also had golf on his mind. Boro\u2019s rather more gentlemanly owner was helping preside over the construction of one of Europe\u2019s longest courses in attractively undulating parkland adjacent to the club\u2019s training ground south of Darlington. Alongside it, a \u00a360m investment was turning Rockliffe Hall, a 19th-century mansion house, into one of the UK\u2019s finest five-star hotels and, potentially, a guarantor of Boro\u2019s future prosperity. Ranked second in TripAdvisor\u2019s 2012 list of UK luxury hotels, it represents one of Gibson\u2019s proudest achievements. \u201cRockliffe Hall is fantastic, a gem to this area,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s special. We believe it will eventually create an income equal to our gate revenue. Middlesbrough FC represents a town of only 120,000-125,000 people so we\u2019ve got to punch above our weight.\u201d Seven years ago this task was complicated by the international credit crunch which forced Gibson \u2013 who, over the years, has poured more than \u00a3100m into Boro \u2013 to find new ways of restructuring the club\u2019s then \u00a385m debt. That sum has since been eliminated but, with Rockliffe Hall gobbling cash, Southgate confronted austerity. The most expensive squad in Boro\u2019s history was swiftly dismantled with the manager trimming \u00a37m from the wage bill before relegation was confirmed in May 2009. One hundred and 12 miles south-west across the Pennines, the horizon looked appreciably brighter. Eight months earlier Sheikh Mansour and his Abu Dhabi United Group had bought City. No matter that their first vanity signing, Robinho, would prove virtually as ineffective as Southgate\u2019s purchases of Alves and Mido, Mansour was writing off City\u2019s \u00a3305m debt while spending countless millions more in pursuit of two titles secured by Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini. With the appointments of the soon-to-be-sacked Southgate\u2019s successors, Gordon Strachan and Tony Mowbray, lacking similar impact, Boro seemed consigned to Championship anonymity but Gibson was quietly forging strong links with Jorge Mendes, the international football agent and Peter Kenyon, the former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive. Formulating a new blueprint based broadly around Moneyball principles he began establishing relationships with assorted European clubs including Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Juventus and Chelsea involving scope for future loan arrangements. Most importantly, Aitor Karanka replaced Mowbray. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s former assistant at Real Madrid will most definitely not be underestimated by Pellegrini. It is no fluke that Boro\u2019s well-coached team of homegrown products, bargain overseas imports and smart loan acquisitions, travel to the Etihad sitting second in the Championship. \u201cAppointing Aitor was a real change for us,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cIn the past I\u2019ve been accused of being a little Englander but football\u2019s global now \u2013 we\u2019re all one.\u201d Along the way Adam Clayton\u2019s world has been turned upside down. In May 2008 a midfielder expected to start for Karanka\u2019s side on Saturday afternoon was ending his first year as a young professional at City. \u201cI grew up in a house 10 minutes from Maine Road,\u201d Clayton says. \u201cI was seven when I joined City\u2019s Academy and I watched the first team every week. I went eight or nine years without missing a single home game.\u201d He was there when City dropped into English football\u2019s third tier and, at one point, counted five managers coming and going in bewilderingly swift succession. \u201cCity\u2019s a completely different club to the one I joined as a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cNow there\u2019s no one there I know player-wise except Joe Hart. \u201cBut I\u2019m really looking forward to going back. I\u2019ve played at the Etihad loads of times for the reserves but being involved in a top-class game will be special for me as a City fan and for Boro as a club. We want to prove ourselves against the best.\u201d Where are they now? Manchester City 1 Andreas Isaksson \u2013 now 33.

Here is the first, about a headline, later changed: \u201cPlease be more thoughtful about how women are described. They should not be introduced or identified through their association with a man. The offending headline, \u2018Spanish king\u2019s sister to stand trial on tax fraud charges\u2019, accompanies a story about Spain\u2019s Princess Cristina\u00a0(23\u00a0December 2014). \u201cHer title is Princess, not \u2018Spanish king\u2019s sister\u2019. By that standard, he is \u2018former king\u2019s son\u2019. She has a title, and does not need to be introduced by her association with her brother, father or husband. The primary subject of the story is a woman with a name and title. Your headline reduces her to an extension of the king, and gives her no autonomous identity.\u201d At first it seemed to me to be less clear-cut. In describing her as \u201cSpanish king\u2019s sister\u201d, the subeditor was making the importance of the story clear, because it reached right to the top of Spain\u2019s establishment. The problem with describing her as Princess Cristina is that she is less well known. I thought the story was about making clear the alleged corruption at the heart of the Spanish establishment, rather than her as a person. After I\u2019d conceded that I might be wrong, the reader came back to agree on that at least: \u201cI think \u2018Spanish Princess Cristina\u2019 would well convey the extent of her royal highness. Short of being queen, there is no more elevated position or rank for a royal woman in Spain\u2019s establishment. By your logic, Prince Charles should be called \u2018son of Queen Elizabeth\u2019 and the poor wee baby George would be unfamiliar to your readers unless described first as \u2018great-grandson of Queen Elizabeth\u2019. Will I be seeing those references in your headlines soon?\u201d Fair point, well made. When the princess was next in the news my subeditor colleagues plumped for \u201cSpanish government drops support for Princess Cristina over tax fraud charges\u201d. Another, even clearer example of an ill-considered usage came early in the new year from a reader: \u201cToday\u2019s headline, \u2018Dozens killed in stampede at Shanghai celebration\u2019 (front page of the website, 1 January) has the strapline, \u2018At least 36 people die, including 25 women, in Shanghai waterfront new year crush\u2019. \u201cNobody would write the strapline \u2018At least 36 people die, including 11 men\u00a0\u2026\u2019, so why point out the number of women? In what way is it of any interest to anyone that, of the 36 people killed, 25 are women? It\u2019s not as though it\u2019s at all surprising or remarkable that there were women present at a new year\u2019s\u00a0celebration. \u201cThis is not mere pedantry. Pointing out the number of women in this kind of situation suggests that women are somehow intrinsically more precious or defenceless or less deserving of (say) being killed in a stampede than men \u2013 something that we should be especially sad or shocked about. This is obvious from the fact that \u2018women\u2019 is almost always closely followed by \u2018children\u2019 (as in the first bullet point when you click through to the article: \u2018At least 36 people have died, including 25 women and some children.\u2019 Pointing out the number of women is, frankly, just sexist. It\u2019s not an especially pernicious form of sexism, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s unintentional \u2013 but it\u2019s still sexism ... It\u2019s 2015, not 1915.\u201d That\u2019s so well put that there is little to add other than that I agree. Finally, a colleague came to me to protest that a headline in G2, \u201cAs the years go by, I enjoy my sexuality more\u201d, above an interview with Caroline Quentin (21 January), who is appearing in a remake of Fanny Hill, was not a true representation of what the piece was actually about. She said that the article was really about the reality of life as a prostitute, sexual abuse and images of older women in the wider world. The quotation used for the headline comes in the last paragraph \u2013 maybe a point too far? I don\u2019t think so; this is a piece that covers sexuality in many different ways. Headlines are meant to grab the attention, but perhaps not like the early suggestion for that story \u2013 hastily rejected by editors \u2013 which included a couple of references, from the play, to \u201cflesh brush\u201d and \u201clove\u00a0truncheon\u201d.", "tags": ["Women", "The Guardian", "National newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "Media", "Life and style", "Caroline Quentin"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-25T19:29:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/26/greece-elections-euro-hits-11-year-low-after-anti-austerity-party-victory", "sentences": ["The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped by 0.3%, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite shed 0.8%."], "title": "Greece elections: euro hits 11-year low after victory for anti-austerity party", "article": "The prospect of a standoff between Greece\u2019s new leftwing government and the European Union briefly sent the euro to an 11-year low against the dollar on Monday, as the world digested Sunday\u2019s victory by anti-austerity party Syriza.

In anticipation of a Syriza victory on Sunday, the euro had slumped to 130.15 yen, its lowest level against the Japanese currency since September 2013. Growing speculation that the Greek bailout is under threat would continue to hit the euro, said Chang Wei Liang at Mizuho Bank in Tokyo. \u201cDoubts over whether the EU bailout program will be extended should keep Greek bonds and the euro under pressure,\u201d Chang said. \u201cSyriza\u2019s victory could signal a broadening shift of support away from mainstream political parties toward economic populism, and might lead to more active political pressure to pare back austerity measures within Spain and Italy as well.\u201d The single currency had already plummeted on Friday after the European Central Bank [ECB] announced a trillion euro stimulus to boost growth and ward off deflation, mimicking anti-deflationary policies pioneered by Japan\u2019s central bank. Analysts said Sunday\u2019s election result in Greece, which saw Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras triumph over prime minister Antonis Samaras, had cast doubt on Greece\u2019s willingness to compromise with, say, an agreement to extend its debt and remain in the euro. Yuzo Sakai, at Tokyo Forex and Ueda Harlow, said the ECB quantitative easing measures, combined with Sunday\u2019s election result, had dealt the euro a \u201ddouble punch\u201d. \u201cAlthough the possibility seems low that Greece will exit the eurozone, the change of government casts a sense of unease about how Greece will act within the eurozone and traders will be paying close attention to signals from the new government,\u201d Sakai told Kyodo News. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear bottom to the euro\u2019s fall and some economists believe it is headed toward parity with the dollar.\u201d Some analysts have said that parity with the dollar will be more likely if the euro breaks the key level of US$1.10.

They parted on reasonable terms, according to the agreed party line, although there were tensions after five largely successful and happy years. Now Vallverdu (who disputes talk of even mild rancour) will be doing his best to undermine Murray\u2019s bid and he has good ammunition to work with in Berdych, who put Rafael Nadal out of the tournament on Tuesday shortly before Murray beat the exciting Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios. After winning 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 in gusts that swirled and dipped around a packed Rod Laver Arena in chill-to-the-bone conditions, Murray fielded the expected questions about Vallverdu cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said when asked what it would be like seeing his old friend in his opponent\u2019s box on Thursday night. \u201cWhen I finished working with Miles Maclagan he started working with [Marcos] Baghdatis. I played against Baghdatis a few times, at the Olympics and in Tokyo, with Miles there. I didn\u2019t really have an issue with it.   Related: Andy Murray beats Nick Kyrgios to reach Australian Open semis \u2013 as it happened    \u201cBut, again, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ll find it weird on the day.

So I don\u2019t think about that in the next days.\u201d Nor, he said, would he dwell on what Vallverdu may be contributing to Berdych\u2019s tennis, which has been superb in this tournament. \u201cWatching is one thing, seeing someone\u2019s game, but when you get on the court with them things are actually a lot different. It seems like you might be able to attack certain areas of someone\u2019s game, or something that they do might look really good, but what matters is when you\u2019re on the court can you exploit those things, that weakness? \u201cThat weakness, is it as weak as you think? It\u2019s completely different when you\u2019re out there on the court, in my opinion. We\u2019ll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are. But, you know, I also know what Dani thinks of Berdych\u2019s game because he\u2019s told me, so it works both ways.\u201d Berdych, who beat a woefully underdone Nadal 6-2, 6-0, 7-6, was similarly circumspect. \u201cWe set up before the match the right tactics, then I was able to execute that on the court,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m really happy about. But I\u2019m going to keep it secret. It would be pointless if I opened up everything here. But he\u2019s changed a lot of things.\u201d Berdych denied that he had asked Ivan Lendl to approach Vallverdu on his behalf, after his fellow Czech had turned down his request to make a comeback to coaching after leaving Murray last March. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to say it very clearly: the time that I talked to Ivan was after Shanghai when the season was still on and everybody was under agreements: me with my coaches and probably Dani with his team. We never talked about anyone else because my approach was to Ivan and not anyone else. So we didn\u2019t talk about it at all.\u201d Nadal could offer no reason for his poor performance other than that he was outplayed.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tomas Berdych", "Australian Open 2015", "Australian Open", "Sport", "Tennis"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-27T13:18:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/28/beijing-smog-unliveable-mayor-wang-anshun-china", "sentences": ["In September 2013, China\u2019s cabinet introduced a sweeping anti-pollution plan, which included prohibiting the construction of new coal-fired power plants in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the country\u2019s three most important cities."], "title": "Beijing smog makes city unliveable, says mayor", "article": "Beijing\u2019s mayor, Wang Anshun, has called the city \u201cunliveable\u201d because of its noxious smog, according to state media. \u201cTo establish a first-tier, international, liveable and harmonious city, it is very important to establish a system of standards, and Beijing is currently doing this,\u201d he said last Friday, according to the China Youth Daily newspaper. \u201cAt the present time, however, Beijing is not a liveable city.\u201d Anshun\u2019s speech came days before the market research company Euromonitor International announced, in its findings on the global tourism market in 2013, that tourism to Beijing had declined by 10% from the year before due to pollution and a countrywide economic slowdown.

Here are some of the pressing challenges Easterbrook will need to address. Winning back customers who have fallen out of love with McDonalds     Customers are falling out of love with McDonalds Photograph: Luke MacGregor / Alamy/Alamy    Once loyal McDonald\u2019s customers have had their heads turned by its more up-market fast-food rivals such as Shake Shack, Five Guys and Chipotle. Easterbrook will have to work out a way to reignite the customer\u2019s love affair with the Big Mac.   Related: McDonald\u2019s chief executive steps down after sales slump    Young people in the US are taking their custom elsewhere. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald\u2019s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year-olds visiting is flat. As McDonald\u2019s sales figures go into reverse, sales at Chipotle Mexican Grill are soaring. Shake Shack meanwhile has transformed from a single hot dog stand in Manhattan\u2019s Madison Square Park a decade ago into a 63-strong chain operating in nine countries. It is preparing for a stock market floatation that will value the company at $568m (\u00a3374m). Taking on Burger King for low-income customers     Burger King restaurant in Piccadilly, London Photograph: Sarah Lee    At the other end of the spectrum, McDonald\u2019s needs to make sure that it can still attract low-income customers, rather than losing out to its traditional rival Burger King. Burger King has served up better results recently, which the chain has partly put down to its focus on price and success of its value menu range.

Photograph: Kim Kulish/Kim Kulish/Corbis    McDonald\u2019s has a reputation for paying its staff poorly. The company has been hit by protests from workers, many of whom earn the minimum wage despite being with the company for years. Shareholder activists last year called for the salary of outgoing chief executive Don Thompson to be cut, citing the chain\u2019s poor performance and the massive gap between his wages and those of the average McDonald\u2019s worker. At a time when it is losing customers, the company could really do without the additional bad pr. Sort out China, where it has been rocked by food safety scandals     A man sleeps outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Beijing Photograph: GREG BAKER/Associated Press     Steve Easterbrook will need to make a concerted effort to clean up McDonald\u2019s reputation on food safety, which has taken a battering following scandals in China. Last summer, a supplier to the chain\u2019s restaurants in China was accused of supplying rotting meat and falsifying meat expiry dates. Local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at the supplier in question, Shanghai Husi Food, claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC kitchens. There was a near three week shortage of meat products in some of its Chinese restaurants after it suspended orders from the supplier.  The company is still dealing with the fall-out from the situation. Sales in Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa fell by 4.8% in the final quarter of last year on a like-for-like basis, stripping out the impact of restaurants open for less than a year. McDonald\u2019s said the drop was \u201cprimarily due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue on sales and profitability in China, Japan and certain other markets\u201d. While it is having a clear and quantifiable impact on financial results, the cost to its reputation could be greater. McDonald\u2019s has also been hit by food safety concerns in Russia - apparently politically motivated as the US company is caught up in Russia\u2019s dispute with the West over Ukraine. About half of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia were put under government investigation.

There\u2019s a bond and you can get either depressed or exhilarated.\u201d Maseeh Rahman in Delhi Rest of Asia The clash between Manchester City and Chelsea will be the most closely watched Premier League game this weekend in Asia but it will not attract the same passionate attention as some other fixtures in the calendar. The kick-off time does not help. In south-east Asia \u2013 the region that loves the league the most \u2013 the game starts in the early hours of Sunday morning. For China, South Korea and Japan those early hours are even later. Lunchtime kick-offs are always better. Chelsea and, especially, City are still lagging behind Manchester United (even if the claims two years ago of 325 million followers in Asia are fanciful), as well as Liverpool and Arsenal and the big two in Spain or the massive one in Germany.     Fans of Manchester United in Shanghai react as they watch their team in action. Photograph:   Aly Song / Reuters/Reuters    For December\u2019s Manchester United-Liverpool clash Carlsberg Malaysia and Carlsberg Hong Kong organised an all-weekend football retreat for 300 fans of the two clubs. There is no such event planned for this weekend. Admittedly that game, while unimportant in title terms, was an earlier kick-off. In Malaysia it attracted around 1.5m cable viewers, though these are unofficial figures. This Chelsea-City top-of-the-table game will struggle to reach half of that figure. City have given their rivals a head start in terms of Asia and success. They are a decade behind Chelsea, two behind United and four behind Liverpool in places like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia and are light years away when it comes to China, Korea and Japan. Chelsea\u2019s longer and more active engagement in Asia and European success means that these Blues are catching up. Still, though, they lack the historic support of their red rivals. As the biggest game in the Premier League this weekend the game will get plenty of play in most local media around Asia but for most it will be due to interest about the result and what it means rather than passion for the teams. John Duerden in Seoul Australia Most Sundays, at the ungodly hour of 4.30am, the Imperial Hotel on the corner of Bourke Street and Spring Street in central Melbourne is not only open; it is filled with football fans. Premier League replica shirts are on show, sweary shouting can be heard and terrace chants are sung. It is an incongruous assault on the senses but not an uncommon one. A similar scene is played out across Australia in the dead of night every weekend, from the beaches of Sydney to Brisbane\u2019s Riverside, from the northern suburbs of Perth to the Adelaide Casino. In Australia football is a sport on the rise and the Premier League is a big deal. Every single game airs live on pay TV \u2013 a situation that UK-based fans can only dream of \u2013 and local hostelries are willing to stay open all night long to give fans a piece of the action. The Imperial Hotel is just one of many pubs that have adopted a Premier League club, or several, to give supporter groups a venue where they can meet and enjoy a game with like-minded fans. The Imperial counts Manchester City among its clubs and, just round the corner, the Portland Hotel is Chelsea. This Sunday morning, despite it being a table-topping clash at Stamford Bridge, neither establishment is expecting a full house. That, the manager of the Imperial, Stephen Marrs, says, is partly due to the kick-off time but also down to the teams involved. \u201cIf it was a Liverpool derby, I\u2019d expect more,\u201d he says. Early starts can dictate how many fans stay up and watch the game, but Marrs says there are a hardcore who will turn up, no matter what time kick-off is. In Brisbane those diehards are more numerous. The cavernous Pig\u2019N\u2019Whistle, which has a capacity of 1,000, plays host to both City and Chelsea fan clubs and big numbers are expected this weekend. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we got less than 250 to 300,\u201d says Jack Nicholson, an employee at the pub. The time difference means that kick-off is an hour earlier in Queensland but those figures at 3.30am are still impressive. Whatever interest in the match there is among fans willing to endure a sleepless night has not, however, been matched in the media. Coverage this week has been light to non-existent in mainstream newspapers, television and online, although that, of course, could change closer to kick-off. This week, of all weeks though, it is unlikely. And it has nothing to do with the identities of the two English clubs involved. The Socceroos\u2019 rampant charge into Saturday\u2019s final of the Asian Cup has captured the imagination of the nation, consumed it (along with Nick Kyrgios\u2019s run at the Australian Open), and meant there are precious few column inches left for coverage of a match being played more than 15,000 kilometres away. Chelsea and City will kick off hours after Australia discovers if its national side has won a first major football trophy and either wild celebrations will be in full swing or fans will be glumly staring into the bottom of empty schooners. However, thousands of Premier League fans, expats and Australians alike, congregated at venues around the country, should ensure the Premier League encounter will not pass by entirely unnoticed. Mike Hytner in Sydney  United States Saturday\u2019s match between first-placed Chelsea and second-placed Manchester City is undoubtedly the biggest game of the Premier League season. But does anyone in the US care? Any other weekend, perhaps. Yet Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots has reduced the biggest game of the Premier League season to an afterthought. \u201cUndoubtedly the hardcore fans in the US can\u2019t wait for this salivating match-up but the game lacks buzz in the sports press here because everything gets overshadowed by the Super Bowl,\u201d Sports Illustrated\u2019s Richard Deitsch says. \u201cThere are so many media resources directed toward Glendale this week that it\u2019s very hard for any other event \u2013 whether in the US or abroad \u2013 to get any kind of traction. Had this happened on any other week, I think the chatter would be different.\u201d Saturday\u2019s match will be carried on NBC, who purchased the Premier League\u2019s US broadcasting rights in 2012 for an estimated $250m (\u00a3165m), more than triple Fox\u2019s previous contract. The deal puts select Premier League matches on over-the-air television and represents a bellwether for soccer\u2019s growing profile stateside. Premier League Live, NBC\u2019s pre- and post-match studio show hosted by Rebecca Lowe, will originate from downtown Phoenix during Super Bowl weekend. In effect the network is appropriating Chelsea-Man City as a lead-in to its blanket coverage of the NFL\u2019s showcase event. That is not to say Saturday\u2019s match will not move the needle among hardcore fans. The supporters\u2019 clubs for both sides here in New York \u2014 Legends in Midtown for Chelsea and the Mad Hatter in Kips Bay for Manchester City \u2014 are both expecting overflow crowds. However, the idea of soccer cracking the American mainstream in any meaningful way is wildly optimistic with the Super Bowl hype machine in overdrive. NBC\u2019s most-watched Premier League match was the Manchester United-Chelsea match at Old Trafford last October. That 1-1 draw attracted 1.29m viewers on NBC to rank as the most watched Premier League game since the network began its coverage in August 2013. \u201cI would not expect this game to top it,\u201d Deitsch says. Bryan Armen Graham in New York  South America The appetite for English football here in Brazil is immense. There are five or six live Premier League matches at the weekend, plus coverage of the cup and Championship games. Premier League replica shirts are a familiar sight everywhere you go and the interest in football is often wrapped up with a passion for English culture; particularly music. It is not uncommon to find locals who follow a Brazilian club and Manchester United, Chelsea or Arsenal. This should not come as a surprise. The domestic product is in decline. Brazilian teams are bereft of real stars and the football is stuck in a time warp as Kak\u00e1 lamented at the end of his loan spell with S\u00e3o Paulo last year. Chelsea versus City is something special because six Brazilians could feature (seven if you count Diego Costa). Both clubs have a good social media presence here and there is a real buzz among the fans. \u201cWe believe the game could be the title decider. And it will be the first time that [Frank] Lampard is back at Stamford Bridge. It will be really exciting,\u201d said Guilherme Neto from Chelsea Brasil. Jo\u00e3o Hugo from Citizens Brasil was also pumped up. \u201cWe\u2019re organising a meeting at a pub in Rio de Janeiro \u2026 If we win, the gap will be down to two points. City will be motivated and will be up for it as always.\u201d Fox Sports has the fixture and is billing it as the biggest event in the Premier League calendar so far. \u201cWe are treating it as premium content,\u201d said the programming director, Rog\u00e9rio Brand\u00e3o. \u201cIt\u2019s a game that\u2019s really grabbed the fans\u2019 attention \u2026 We are giving it high visibility across the Fox family channels. [The match] will be our big event of the week and its repercussions will feed the programme schedule for the coming weeks.\u201d Gustavo Villani will be the man behind the microphone. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of game that makes me lose sleep the night before. I\u2019ve prepared for days. But the 90 minutes will be over in a flash.\u201d Jon Cotterill in S\u00e3o Paulo  Africa More Africans now swear by the big five sides \u2013 Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City \u2013 rather than for their own local teams. And on the surface it may appear the historic importance of games between either of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal is losing ground to the new money of Chelsea versus Manchester City. \u201cSince the Russian and Qatari funds came into both teams I\u2019d definitely say Chelsea\u2013City is a bigger game now,\u201d says Joachim Tembo, a Zambian sports journalist. Adeola Olalekan, a Nigerian analyst, posits a contributory factor. \u201cFixtures grow on success so, as a lot of youth in this generation have no memories of when Liverpool were a force, they switch focus to the lure of Chelsea and City.\u201d     Kenyan football fans watch Arsenal and Manchester United Photograph: Noor Khamis/ Reuters    For Liverpool fans across the continent, however, their claim to continuing relevance in these fixtures boils down to history. \u201cIt\u2019s the history that matters. Liverpool are United\u2019s closest challenges for top-flight titles and that\u2019s what will keep this fixture relevant in the eyes of Kopites,\u201d Abdul Kadir, a freelance Gambian journalist, argues. \u201cAlso, saying, for example, that Liverpool v Arsenal isn\u2019t as big any more is a bit like saying Newcastle v Sunderland is not a big deal because they aren\u2019t what they used to be \u2013 it\u2019s illogical.\u201d But as I have travelled across the continent, the growth of Chelsea versus Manchester City as a fixture is evident because the success of both teams means they are attracting new fans all the time. However, the feeling is that it would take some time before it overtakes the glamour of meetings between the big three, no matter how poor Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United have been recently.

Cheatle runs Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge business that helps people to organise aspects of their lives that they don\u2019t have the time or inclination to do themselves. This can be anything from booking exclusive tables at restaurants to organising hard-to-get tickets and negotiating airfares.  The company, which provides services to more than two million members worldwide, started in London with 20 members. In 2001, Ten won its first corporate contract to provide concierge on behalf of a major banking group. It now runs more than 70 customer and employee loyalty schemes.   Related: Destined for greatness: but how did these businesses start out?    It all started in 1998, when Cheatle was in California recovering from malaria he\u2019d caught in Cambodia while travelling the world in search of a business idea. The idea for Ten Group formed while he was \u201cgetting his head straight\u201d; the illness, he says, energised him and made him do something about it. Cheatle wasn\u2019t tempted to set up a dotcom business.\u201cI was obsessed with trust and wanted to set up a business that focused on being trustworthy. The strongest and richest relationships of trust are between people rather than between people and slow, late 90s-style websites, so I didn\u2019t want a dotcom experience to get between us and our members.\u201d While it was exciting being in San Francisco during this time there were also drawbacks. \u201cIn our very early days we were under pressure to stick up a website whether or not our members actually wanted one just so we could claim to be a dotcom and then increase our valuation significantly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took courage to stick to our principles \u2013 but it\u2019s one reason why we were one of very few innovative London/UK start-ups in the late 90s that didn\u2019t lose its shareholders their shirts.\u201d Cheatle predicted that in the 21st century people were going to be given more choice and have more complex decisions to make. \u201cI believed that the future was going to be marked by a marketing and sales overload with businesses trying to get people to buy their product. I thought there was a real opportunity here for an organisation that helps people, on their own agenda and in an uncomplicated, unbiased way. And I thought: \u2018We\u2019re going to set that up.\u2019\u201d The entrepreneur did not dismiss the powers of the internet. \u201cI knew we would need digital technology,\u201d he says, \u201cbut inside the business. I wanted to grow it by having personal contact, human-to-human.\u201d The business grew considerably from 2007 and opened offices in San Francisco, New York, Zurich, Brussels, Miami, Mexico City, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Cape Town, Mumbai, Dubai, Brussels, S\u00e3o Paulo and Melbourne \u2013 in addition to London and Maidenhead in the UK.   Related: Do entrepreneurs make their own luck?    Cheatle says the company\u2019s real breakthrough came when he realised that the concierge model was of value to financial institutions and large businesses. It was a gradual dawning but, he says, \u201cwe figured that many of our members wouldn\u2019t need to pay for our service. We worked out that big brands and financial institutions would pay for the service on their customers\u2019 behalf to develop value and trust with their own client base.\u201d Coutts in the UK was among Ten\u2019s first corporate contracts. Ten Group has also worked with Maserati in Italy. The business created a staff of expert lifestyle managers. \u201cWhen we first set up we thought that if we had talented generalists to deal with the members\u2019 requests they would quickly become experts in particular areas through experience alone.\u201d This didn\u2019t work, so Ten started hiring ma\u00eetre ds, sommeliers or people who were writing leading food blogs, for example. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hire experts in order to grow a culture of passion and expertise and this was another real breakthrough for us,\u201d says Cheatle. The road hasn\u2019t been without its hurdles. Cheatle says: \u201cWorking out how to deal with all the different sectors that we had to become expert in was tough. Every industry has a distinct culture and personality.\u201d Convincing hotels to give them good rates and upgrades is a numbers-driven contract conversation, whereas, he says, \u201ccreating great relationships with restaurateurs so they give us tables that they would not give to the general public is far more about personal trust, friendships and the human touch\u201d. In the 2001 downturn Ten had to reduce its staff from 100 to 33. However, the company stayed positive and, says Cheatle, \u201cbecause of this downsizing and the resilience of the core team during this tough period, the company survived into the strong 450-strong business it is now\u201d.

But sometimes our obsession with how to improve it can appear somewhat myopic, with an over-focus on internal change that can blind us to other approaches from around the world that are already achieving better outcomes for patients. This was brought home to me on a recent visit to Shanghai, which deals with more than 3 million episodes of care a year. While we in the west still regard China as playing catch-up, Shanghai is a glittering model of modernity \u2013 indeed, it\u2019s almost a glimpse into the future. Think air-conditioned underground, skyscrapers and a savvy, smartphone-addicted population. The health service of this hectic, booming megacity of 24 million people has had to keep up. So on my trip to the Shanghai People\u2019s Number One Hospital, I got a taste of how a service that operates without an effective primary care system manages to deal with so many patients. To cope, the hospital is run as a production line for health. Rows of endoscopy suites cater for patients and productivity per suite is twice that of UK hospitals. Consultants are expected to see all the people who turn up on the day \u2013 most without a pre-booked appointment \u2013 and soon they can be ushered into a nearby operating theatre, very often with family members sitting in a huge waiting room just outside the theatre doors. Now I\u2019m not saying the UK could or should adopt the Shanghai approach to patient demand. But this method certainly helps them to deal with their particular circumstances, with a very high patient-to-clinician ratio. China surprised me in other ways, too. For example, they already have national electronic patient records for the whole country to cope with mind-boggling patient numbers \u2013 something the UK is still grappling with despite numerous costly initiatives over the years. And China isn\u2019t the only country that\u2019s blazing a trail for others. We might also want to take a leaf out of the Danes\u2019 book for their approach to implementing standards for healthcare technology and hospital reconfiguration; the Australian funding approach, which ensures universal access to care and regulates the private insurance sector to prevent older citizens or those with pre-existing conditions being discriminated against; or the Norwegian approach to healthcare data sharing and clinical registries. \u00a0 The point here is that there\u2019s a whole world out there to learn from. We look outside the UK for new technology such as robotic surgery or pharmaceuticals; we read journals and papers in our area of specialisation from across the globe.\u00a0However, it\u2019s very rare for the non-clinical leaders in our hospitals \u2013 finance directors, chief executives and so forth \u2013 to sit down and consider the big clinical and policy issues on a national basis, let alone an international one. And rarely do we get clinicians and hospital management in the same room debating and exchanging views.\u00a0 At Dr Foster, we\u2019ve set up a network of executives and clinicians from progressive hospitals around the world called Global Comparators, which delves into healthcare data to examine differences in outcomes internationally, to spot where this can be attributed to clinical practice or policy. It\u2019s generating a string of international collaborative research programmes, which are providing new insight into how different systems are performing relative to each other. So for example, at our recent conference in London we heard from Prem Chana from the Centre for Patient Safety and Service Quality at Imperial College London. His study on emergency laparotomy \u2013 a high-risk surgical procedure that involves making an incision to provide access to the abdominal cavity \u2013 showed big variations in 30-day mortality rates between England, the US and Australia. England\u2019s rate was the worst, and this is thought to be due to the fact that healthcare systems in the US and Australia provide more robust and efficient pathways of care for emergency patients. Meanwhile, on stroke care, Professor Jin-Moo Lee of Washington University School of Medicine told us how England, which had among the highest mortality rate in 2005, saw a dramatic reduction in stroke deaths over the following five years \u2013 an improvement not seen in other countries. So as we fixate on the future direction of the NHS and how we can get the best results for patients with the most efficient use of resources, we would do well to lift our eyes occasionally. There may not be one \u201cperfect\u201d health system, but its component parts are out there today in hospitals around the world. We just need to find them. If we examine what\u2019s out there already, we might save ourselves from reinventing the wheel. Are you a member of our online community?

Republic of the Congo have been practising penalties but it is probably best that nobody\u2019s confidence is eroded any further: the last of an inauspicious set was sent three goals high by the 6ft 5in striker F\u00e9r\u00e9bory Dor\u00e9, and his French manager shuffles towards the sideline inscrutably. \u201cThat was just for the goalkeepers,\u201d he says with the hint of a smile, anticipating any raised eyebrows, and you decide to believe him. LeRoy has achieved enough to be allowed the benefit of any doubt. This is the Frenchman\u2019s eighth Africa Cup of Nations, the 2006 and 2013 editions of which he entered in separate stints as manager of Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), his current employers\u2019 close neighbours. He left DR Congo in June 2013, crossing over to Brazzaville six months later. Few foreign coaches have engaged with the continent as deeply as LeRoy, but new experiences keep on presenting themselves. On Saturday his side will face DR Congo in a rare \u201cderby\u201d fixture between the Congos, and the coach will be confronted with a team that he believes he created. \u201cThis is David against Goliath,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cWe are four million [inhabitants] and they are 70 million. But sometimes the small guy can create problems for the bigger one and we\u2019ll try, tactically, to cause them trouble. \u201cRemember, I know their team perfectly. I keep hearing that it\u2019s a new team, but it\u2019s almost the same one I built four years ago. There was a great atmosphere between us and I\u2019ll be very happy to see them again. I still wish the president of their federation all the best by SMS before every game, and this will be the one time that I don\u2019t.\u201d LeRoy, who turns 67 two days before next Sunday\u2019s final, can undersell his outsiders all he likes, but he is fooling no-one. They played out a stuttering draw against an Equatorial Guinea side in the first match of the tournament, but the response was decisive. Gabon were beaten 1-0 before a late Fabrice N\u2019Guessi goal secured a 2-1 victory against a highly fancied Burkina Faso side that put Congo through as Group A winners \u2013 with more points than any of their 15 rivals managed in the first round. The old master is doing it again. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream for us to be in the last eight,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have come so far. This is a diligent team that loves to work; they worked hard during our training camp at Diambars [the Senegalese academy part-owned by Patrick Vieira] and we knew that we were ready on a physical and mental level. It\u2019s more about finding tactical solutions at this stage. \u201cWe know we have already achieved some fantastic things for this country. They had not qualified for 15 years; we\u2019ve won two group games for the first time in 41 years; in qualifying we won in Nigeria for the first time in 40 years. Now the reward is this fantastic game against DR Congo and everything is beautiful for us. Anything from now onwards is a bonus \u2013 but we want more and more bonuses.\u201d LeRoy is charming and relaxed in conversation, but his default setting in the dugout and on the training pitch sits somewhere between incredulity and exasperation. Yannick Bolasie, the Crystal Palace winger to whom LeRoy gave a debut for DRC in 2013, said on Thursday that his former manager \u201cdoes not take any crap from anyone\u201d. You can well believe it, and his willingness to speak truths to those in the Confederation of African Football\u2019s (Caf) corridors of power in the last two weeks has been evidence enough of that. But he wears kid gloves too. Barely a minute of his training session passes without LeRoy being in conversation with one or other of his players, quietly pulled to one side, and many of those who have worked with him believe that his knack for man-management has contributed greatly to his longevity in Africa. \u201cWhatever the job, you have to bring all your character, your passion and always be the same coach for yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you are the never the same man for 23 players. You are 23 times a different coach to them depending on the background, the socio-cultural education of the player \u2013 their culture, their life and footballing habits. You have to be clever and smart, and manage a player depending on his sensibilities. That\u2019s what I am passionate about.\u201d His formula has worked in other corners of the world. He and his protege, Herv\u00e9 Renard, the coach of Ivory Coast, worked together at Shanghai Cosco before pulling Cambridge United out of the League Two relegation mire in 2004 (\u201cThat few months was a huge pleasure. I had to leave because I was offered the DR Congo job but I enjoyed it so much and had good contact from some Championship clubs at the time too \u2013 I had to take a very fast decision, and sometimes it got me thinking \u2013 but I would like to work in England\u201d). Under his managership Oman won their first ever Gulf Cup title in 2009, and he has also managed in Syria, Malaysia, UAE and France. But his relationship with Africa, where he has managed five countries in seven spells, is profound. \u201cEverywhere I have worked is close to my heart, because you build your life like that. Point by point, some faces, some smiles, some eyes \u2013 if you have good relations you don\u2019t forget them. \u201cI love this continent and the people. My wife loves it and my children do too. They grew up in Cameroon and Senegal, they went to school there, they have close friends on this continent. My father fought as a political leader for the independence of countries like Algeria and Congo, so I\u2019ve been concerned by Africa ever since I was a kid.\u201d \u201cConcerned\u201d was the right word when Congo arrived in Equatorial Guinea for this tournament. A number of LeRoy\u2019s players and staff went without hotel rooms before the opening game against the host nation, while Caf officials appeared to be staying in luxurious accommodation. Their Vistamar apartments are indeed a sight to behold but, a few mutterings aside, LeRoy has calmed down now. He still provides a stark picture of facilities in remote Ebibeyin, where Congo played against Burkina Faso. \u201cWe\u2019re OK now, we\u2019ve got a normal hotel. It\u2019s not a thing for me, it\u2019s for the players. They have to be fed and rested, and while we don\u2019t want luxury we expect at least the minimum, like water. We didn\u2019t have any water in our four days in Ebibeyin.\u201d He mimics pouring water over himself from a bottle. \u201cBut on the whole everything has seemed better since that first match. The preparation for the first game was unbelievable, but that\u2019s football. Well, no, it\u2019s not football \u2013 but it was the reality of the situation.\u201d The reality now is that Congo, nine of whose squad are based in the obscure domestic league and whose only real star is Thievy Bifouma, who spent time with West Bromwich Albion last season, are a game away from their best African Cup of Nations result since 1974. That year, they came fourth; two years previously they had won the competition for the first and only time. DR Congo, in those days, was known as Zaire. \u201cRepublic of Congo is a small country with some potential, but DR Congo has huge potential in African football,\u201d says LeRoy. \u201cThere are similarities with Nigeria. If things are one day organised at a normal level I think they can achieve a lot of things. There have always been so many possibilities, so many good players, so much talent and now you have to help them. \u201cI am sure it will be a bit of a confrontation between the two Congos \u2013 but it\u2019s a football game and we will try to show perfect behaviour. We made a good tactical plan for Gabon and Burkina Faso, and now the players and I must put something together for DR Congo.\u201d They surely will. But for all his preparations, you remember LeRoy\u2019s walk away from the training ground penalty shoot-out and wonder whether he knew he had just witnessed the kind of eventuality that not even one of Africa\u2019s master tacticians can control.", "tags": ["Africa Cup of Nations 2015", "Africa Cup of Nations", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-01-31T10:00:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/31/chinese-firm-creates-worlds-tallest-3d-printed-building", "sentences": ["Print your own apartment A construction firm from Shanghai has unveiled what they are calling \u201cthe world\u2019s tallest 3D-printed building\u201d: a five-storey apartment building made using a 3D printer."], "title": "Chinese firm creates 'world's tallest 3D-printed building'", "article": "The best city stories from around the web this week discover a five-storey building in China made using a 3D printer, explore a futuristic idea for a fully sustainable city in the desert and reveal the safest cities in the world.

Print your own apartment A construction firm from Shanghai has unveiled what they are calling \u201cthe world\u2019s tallest 3D-printed building\u201d: a five-storey apartment building made using a 3D printer. The building is on display at the Suzhou Industrial Park, alongside a 3D-printed neoclassical mansion.  As CityLab explains, the buildings are created with a patented \u201cink\u201d consisting of recycled construction waste, which is then coursed through a printer that is 150 metres long. Could printing our homes be a realistic solution to the housing crises facing cities around the world?

The ideal desert city Italian architect Luca Curci has come up with a proposal for a fully self-sufficient city located in a desert. As Fast Co Exist explains, the design of the city means its residents share all of the resources, from renewable energy to recycled wastewater. The city consists of a network of circular buildings, powered by solar energy and cooled by wind-harvesting devices. Other features include shared electric cars and drinking water provided through desalination. However, the design is still very much hypothetical. \u201cThis is a project proposal for a new way to live in the desert,\u201d Curci explains. \u201cThere are many ways to save and reuse available resources.\u201d Safe cities The Economist Intelligence Unit has published a report on safety in cities \u2013 The Safe Cities Index 2015 \u2013 which has scored cities across four categories: digital security; health security; infrastructure safety; and personal safety.

Uncube magazine have published an interview with Klapsch alongside a gallery of his brilliant images, discussing the process of documenting the city during a period of unique change. \u201cThe division of Berlin has left strong marks on the cityscape,\u201d Klapsch explains; \u201cthe socialist thinking behind Alexanderplatz and its vicinity is still clearly visible. The post-war drive towards new and modern types of housing has also left formative buildings in both former East and West: such as the Stalinist buildings in Karl-Marx-Allee and those in the Hansaviertel in the Tiergarten.\u201d For more photography from the city, check out our gallery of Ciar\u00e1n Fahey\u2019s photographs of Blub, an abandoned swimming pool complex in West Berlin.

Now a fresh controversy has hit preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics \u2013 whether to allow \u201cembarrassing\u201d J-pop phenomenon AKB48 to perform at the opening ceremony. The all-female band, known for high-pitched delivery, saccharine lyrics, wild dance routines and outlandish costumes, has about 140 rotating members ranging in age from their early teens to early 20s, whose appearances in live and recorded performances often depend on their individual popularity among fans. Older singers \u201cgraduate\u201d and are replaced by trainees selected at auditions held twice a year.

The idea drew a withering rebuke from TV celebrity and columnist Matsuko Deluxe, who said the idols would be \u201can embarrassment\u201d.            Deluxe, who is best known for his cross-dressing TV persona, told a radio programme: \u201cI absolutely don\u2019t want them to perform at the opening ceremony. As long as they aren\u2019t part of the opening or closing ceremony, I don\u2019t care what they do, but please use somebody for the opening and closing ceremonies that wouldn\u2019t be an embarrassment.\u201d The wildly popular group\u2019s mooted appearance divided opinion on social media. One user called AKB48 \u201cthe shame of Japan\u201d, according to RocketNews24. A commenter on Japan Today wrote: \u201cAKB is not the image we want the world to have of Japan.\u201d But another leaped to the group\u2019s defence, pointing out that they had raised money for relief efforts after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in north-eastern Japan and acted as ambassadors for Japan\u2019s \u201csoft power\u201d diplomacy. \u201cAKB has been representing Japan in their on country and internationally \u2026 why would they be an embarrassment to Japan if they do all this good?\u201d the poster wrote. Despite making AKB48 Japan\u2019s bestselling group, many Japanese, it seems, would prefer to keep them under wraps. In a 2013 poll seeking suggestions for artists to perform at the Olympics, the group finished a lowly seventh; topping the poll were the Southern All-Stars, a pop rock band that has been a fixture of the Japanese music since the 1970s. Since their debut in 2005, AKB48 have built up a huge following in Japan and in other parts of Asia, although their sugary lyrics and dance routines often draw unfavourable comparisons with South Korea\u2019s more refined brand of pop .

But such has been the nature of this off-season, and such has been the drift in Cahill\u2019s reputation in MLS this past year, that his departure has an anti-climactic feel to it \u2013 more of a tidying up of loose ends from a rapidly eclipsed era at the Red Bulls than a sense of a prized asset being lost. This has been a particularly crazy few months in New York, that at times has seen what are now two MLS sides entering a new competitive era apparently determined to hand the initiative to each other.  So for example just as the Red Bulls looked set to benefit from the fallout of the Frank Lampard debacle in NYCFC\u2019s camp, they conjured one of their own, when new sporting director Ali Curtis sacked folk-hero coach Mike Petke on the eve of pre-season. Petke was not only the coach who had brought the team their first ever trophy (the 2013 Supporters Shield), but as a former player from the team\u2019s MetroStars incarnation, his presence had done a lot to bring round long-term fans skeptical of the Red Bull buyout of the team back in 2006.  By the time the team played New England in last season\u2019s Eastern Conference final home leg, there were banners in the team\u2019s former colors in the corners of the stadium and past players were being paraded onto the field, in direct contrast to years of airbrushing out the past after the extensive Red Bull rebranding. These concessions weren\u2019t Petke\u2019s decisions, but his presence on the sidelines helped create the surprising spirit of Glasnost in the Red Bull\u2019s recent ownership style. But the cautious goodwill engendered by these gestures, and the sense that the post-Thierry Henry era would see the team define their unique selling point as the long-term incumbent MLS side in New York, (in implicit comparison to the nouveau NYCFC) was blown up by the sudden sacking of Petke.  The backlash from Petke\u2019s sacking and replacement with Jesse Marsch would overshadow most of the subsequent moves the Red Bulls front office would make \u2013 including the shrewd way they managed to land the country\u2019s top college player last year, Leo Stolz, from a lowly No18 on the draft, or outsmarting LA Galaxy to trade up for an allocation slot that saw them land Sacha Kljestan, along with Montreal playmaker Felipe Martins, last week. While Curtis had to give up the promising Ambroise Oyongo and the much-improved midfielder Eric Alexander to do so, the sequence looked to have led to an immediate net gain in the Red Bulls personnel fortunes. Instead of heralding a brave new era however, these moves have not offered significant popular relief from the impression that Petke took a lot of long-term fans with him when he left. In all likelihood Marsch will be a tactical upgrade on Petke the motivator, but to the hardcore fans paying for \u201cThank you Mike Petke \u2013 Red Bull out\u201d electronic billboards beside the Lincoln Tunnel in recent days, that\u2019s hardly the point. Similarly NYCFC might point to what\u2019s been a steady stream of positive personnel decisions from their inception \u2013 up to and including the acquisition of young US talent in Mix Diskerud, and wonder why the Lampard storyline has overshadowed those decisions to the extent it has. In particular, David Villa, who has just been announced as the club\u2019s first captain, and who was the first signing for the team, could be forgiven for wondering just where the spotlight has gone. Villa has already shown himself to be a humble and respectful presence for his new team, in his limited public utterances, and deserves much better than to be treated as an afterthought. It\u2019s still silly season in MLS of course \u2013 even if this one has been sillier than most in New York (we\u2019ve not even touched on Raul showing up at the Cosmos\u2026). The current chatter will pass and the season will be underway soon, and New York City fans will be able to assess the actual merits of Villa, Diskerud et al (while waiting for Lampard), while Red Bulls fans will be watching another new incarnation of their team without Henry, without Petke, and now without Cahill.  Looking at these departures as significant phenomena, one of those men is probably irreplaceable, one may have set his replacement up for an impossible task, and one of them seemed to believe he was irreplaceable (before he was replaced last year). Put bluntly, Cahill\u2019s departure is a story, but it\u2019s far from the story in New York soccer this off-season.  Tim Cahill\u2019s time in New York Cahill was an ambiguous presence as a designated player in MLS \u2013 showing traits of the best and worst of the species in his two and a half years with the Red Bulls. Arriving in New York in the middle of the 2012 MLS season, after a largely indifferent season at Everton that had many writing him off and even questioning whether he\u2019d make the 2014 World Cup squad, Cahill made all the right noises in his new home and was an instant locker room presence. Where Henry did little to hide his exasperation with the degree of media access and banal questioning he was subjected to after every game, Cahill was conspicuously on message and always scrupulously vocal in his support of the team and league project. If he was also vocal about his national team ambitions and priorities, there was a certain amount of selective hearing that went on in New Jersey, as at that stage fans preferred to note his crowd-pleasing promises to \u201crun through walls\u201d for his new team. And despite a slow start in that first half-season, and the opening games of the 2013 season, they would be rewarded by a surge in form and driving play from Cahill on the run to the 2013 Supporters Shield. Along the way he became an apparently popular locker room presence \u2013 and at PR events with team-mates he was often front and center, emphasizing his everyman credentials rather than any marquee aloofness.  Ironically, given the later split with Petke, he would be seen as something of an avatar of the coach on the field in 2013 \u2013 the enforcer of Petke\u2019s wish that the Red Bulls shed their reputation for lacking character, once and for all. Perhaps the highlight of Cahill\u2019s time in New York was when New York traveled to Seattle in September 2013, with both sides competing for the Supporters Shield. With Henry and Jamison Olave missing the game on turf, Cahill consistently talked up New York\u2019s chances in the week before the game, then scored a vital equalizer to tilt the Shield charge New York\u2019s way.            It was possibly the peak of his influence. After the Shield win, 2014 was a different story. With two years remaining on his contract Cahill reportedly asked for a significant raise during the off-season and was denied. Subsequently, he seemed to drift with the Red Bulls and MLS. He was noticeably less central within the New York locker room, and his form was indifferent too. Some put it down to his focus on the impending World Cup, but whatever the cause there was a definite malaise about Cahill\u2019s play. Of course this wasn\u2019t helped by Petke trying to figure out how best to use him, given the form and roles of Bradley Wright-Phillips and Thierry Henry, as well as the late-season combination of Eric Alexander and Dax McCarty anchoring the midfield.  Just as significantly though, Cahill\u2019s international absences went from a tacitly accepted cost of having him in New York, to something of an open irritation with the league and club. By the time Cahill returned from the World Cup, his notoriety after scoring one of the goals of the tournament was not enough to get him further than the New York bench on the season run-in. And with that run-in proving a tight one for the Red Bulls, and with Cahill absenting himself from crucial league matches for exhibition games with Australia during it, his priorities found him on a repeat collision course with those of his club.            Certainly Monday\u2019s news did not come as much of a surprise \u2013 from his comments after the playoff elimination last season, it was fairly clear that Cahill was already on his way, and it was just a matter of where.  The Shanghai destination makes sense of the direction the Cahill story has been headed. Beyond his carefully placed talk of the team coming first Cahill has shown a healthy individual ego that suggests he wants to be branded as a leader wherever he goes (and he\u2019ll be making a leader\u2019s salary in Shanghai). He was always unlikely to want to sit on a bench again, even in a more prestigious league than MLS \u2013 and with his stock still at a high in Asia right now, and strangely diminished in New York, this may be Cahill\u2019s best move right now.", "tags": ["New York Red Bulls", "Tim Cahill", "Thierry Henry", "MLS", "US sports", "Australia sport", "Sport", "New York City FC"], "publicationDate": "2015-02-03T15:50:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/feb/05/tim-cahill-end-socceroos-career-blog", "sentences": ["The new Shanghai Shenhua jack-in-the-box Cahill, said that along with his move to China he wants to stay part of the national team as long as Ange Postecoglou will have him there."], "title": "Time for Tim Cahill to stand aside and allow youthful Socceroos to flourish | Anthony Colangelo", "article": "New York, I Love You But You\u2019re Bringing Me Down by LCD Soundsystem is vocalist James Murphy\u2019s ode to his city in transition. It\u2019s about his love for NYC\u2019s shadows of danger and grunge, but as those in charge begin reforming it for the better, the city he adored changed and even though he wanted its addictive and alluring charm to stay, it wasn\u2019t what was right for the city itself.   Tim Cahill and the Socceroos tell a similar story \u2013 Tim Cahill, We Love You But You\u2019ll Start Bringing Us Down is how the song would go, or at least be titled. You\u2019re here, you\u2019re still amazing and we all love you, but for the greater good we need a change.   In the midst of Asian Cup glory the squad and supporters are dealing with transition and while we all ferociously pine over Cahill and are tempted to keep him a Socceroo forever the right thing to do now is to say goodbye. The new Shanghai Shenhua jack-in-the-box Cahill, said that along with his move to China he wants to stay part of the national team as long as Ange Postecoglou will have him there. (Also don\u2019t forget Cahill said pre-Asian Cup he could play on until age 39 for Russia 2018.) But the day before on a Melbourne sports radio station Postecoglou said that the choice of international retirement was up to Cahill.  Of course Postecoglou\u2019s was a diplomatic answer \u2013 giving the exclusive of Cahill\u2019s Socceroo swansong to \u201cThe Ox and Marko Allen\u201d on SEN 1116 is not exactly respectful to the magnitude of such a decision \u2013 however the difference of response from the pair shows how complicated the issue could become in the lead up to the start of qualifying for Russia 2018.   It would be foolish to think that Postecoglou wouldn\u2019t impose judicial weight onto the situation if need be, just as he has in similar decisions at Brisbane Roar, Melbourne Victory and when taking the Socceroos job. Ask Craig Moore, Charlie Miller, Danny Tiatto, Liam Reddy, Harry Kewell, Carlos Hernandez, Lucas Neill, Brett Holman, Mark Schwarzer, Luke Wilkshire and Ante Covic about Postecoglou\u2019s strength of conviction when deciding between appeasing the wishes of a long-serving stalwart against what\u2019s best for the team\u2019s future.  Those decisions were not as big as a decision on Cahill would be, but Postecoglou knows the heartbreak retirement can bring. Postecoglou\u2019s playing career ended due to a knee injury, aged 28, so he is more than capable of empathising with a star who has to move on when they might not think it necessary.      The Socceroos know they can rely on Cahill to deliver, but it that part of the problem? Photograph: Steve Christo/REUTERS     But how does Cahill hold the Socceroos back by playing on for the green and gold? Well, yes, his three Asian Cup goals were vital, his knack for saving Australia is lucrative and if he still has a club he could possibly play through 2018 World Cup qualification and lead the line adequately.   Let\u2019s remember though that the make-up of the Socceroos has now changed with a new found depth, optimism and damaging attacking weaponry. To be blunt Cahill offers very little in general play, which was seen clearly at the Asian Cup.   In the final it was his replacement Tomi Juric whose superb piece of dribbling set up James Troisi\u2019s winning goal while Nathan Burns\u2019s cameos (restricted to such due to Cahill\u2019s presence) were frantic displays of the A-League top scorer\u2019s ability.   If it wasn\u2019t for his remarkable heading ability and penchant for a show-stopping volley or bicycle kick, Cahill would be of much less value to the Socceroos. Are these the kinds of qualities we want the team\u2019s attacking game to be based on?  I\u2019d rather allow another quick, technical and young attacker like Adam Taggart, Burns or Juric join Robbie Kruse, Massimo Luongo and Matthew Leckie in the XI to take our stiflingly skilled offensive abilities to another level.   That summation may seem harsh on Cahill, who has been the embodiment of a legend, a monolith and a father-figure to the national team of late, but if supporters are happy to trumpet the future of the Socceroos in the wake of the Asian Cup win they should feel comfortable about going forward without Cahill.   He has dominated media coverage of the Socceroos for too long, and it is time to see more of the squad\u2019s other players in the limelight. Even his next career choice (explained exclusively LeBron James-style live on Fox Sports News), puff-pieces with commercial TV stations, kicking of a match ball to his son after a warm-up and failure to produce \u2018big-game magic in the final\u2019 stole the limelight from the real starlet of the team at the Asian Cup, Luongo.  Say it quietly, but in the most respectful way, it\u2019s getting to be a cult of personality.  So Tim, we love you, you\u2019re simply a once-in-a-generation footballer. But let the team transition properly now, let youth take over the mantle of Socceroos pin-up boys and holders of national representative responsibility completely.  Because until that emotional and celebratory day of nostalgia when you do walk away, the team will never truly move on.

But proof that even corporate financial professionals are not exempt from being swindled has come with the revelation that a company based in Omaha, Nebraska lost $17.2m in an email scam. A senior employee at the Scoular Company, a privately owned commodities trader founded 120 years ago, wired the money to a bank in China last year in three tranches \u2013 one of $9.4m \u2013 after acting on instructions received in emails from fake addresses. The emails were sent to Keith McMurtry, the corporate controller, and appeared to have come from Chuck Elsea, the chief executive, and its auditing firm. However, they were sent from a different address than the one usually used by Elsea, Omaha.com reported. The FBI said that the first email on 26 June told McMurtry to wire $780,000 to Shanghai Pudong Development Bank \u2013 a genuine institution. The following day he complied with another instruction to transfer $7m, and then he sent another $9.4m three days later. \u2018Not suspicious\u2019 The first two emails from Elsea\u2019s fake address told his colleague that the transfers were for a secret acquisition of a Chinese company and swore him to secrecy. The second email gave the arrangement an air of legitimacy by telling McMurtry to contact an employee of the auditing firm for details of where to send the funds. He subsequently received an email that appeared to be from the firm telling him to send the money to the bank.  McMurtry told the FBI that he was \u201cnot suspicious of the three wire transfer requests\u201d because Scoular had been considering expanding in China, the email address used by the fake auditors appeared to be genuine and the phone number given in one of the emails was answered by a person with a name given in one email when he called.

Elsea said the company had not been affected by the loss, but accepted that it would be difficult to recover the funds \u2013 although the FBI was attempting to do so.  The main victim appears to have been McMurtry: he is no longer one of the 800 people employed by Scoular.

Photograph: Studio Linfors/A Visual History of the Future    The purposeful or accidental translation of these past visions is a phenomenon explored in detail by the UK Government Office for Science, as part of an epic two-year project on the future of cities. In looking ahead 50 years at what UK cities could become, the project has also looked to the past to see how predictions and provocations can become reality \u2013 or not. For their report, A Visual History of the Future, authors Professor Nick Dunn and Serena Pollastri of Lancaster University and Dr Paul Cureton of the University of Hertfordshire, reviewed nearly a thousand examples of proposed cities of the future, boiling them down to around 100 projects, proposals and fictional cities that they felt were emblematic of the shifting paradigms of the last century of urbanism. And by grouping them into categories \u2013 the \u201cregulated\u201d city, the \u201clayered\u201d city, the \u201cflexible\u201d city, and so on \u2013 the authors argue we can better understand how the dominant future urban visions of today may shape our cities in decades to come. One particularly influential idea is the Garden City, first proposed by Ebenezer Howard in 1898. \u201cThe Garden City paradigm is one that just keeps re-emerging, with a slightly different remix each time,\u201d says Dunn. He observes that a number of new themes have become more dominant in recent visions of the future city, among them the ecological city and a trend toward what he calls \u201cstreet-based urbanism\u201d \u2013 \u201chuman-centred cities; cities that are based on people walking, bikes, neighbourhoods. And that\u2019s very tangible for where we are now.\u201d     The Berg (2009) imagines a 1,000-metre manmade mountain on the site of Tempelhof airport in Berlin, Germany.  Photograph: Mila &amp; Jakob Tigges/A Visual History of the Future    Past visions of the future city \u2013 from Howard\u2019s Garden Cities to Albert Speer\u2019s 1939 \u201cWorld Capital Germania\u201d, to Buckminster Fuller\u2019s 1960 proposal for a dome over Manhattan, to Archigram\u2019s reconfigurable, modular 1964 Plug-In City to OMA\u2019s 2010 concept of a low-carbon, interlinked Europe \u2013 will be on display at an exhibition on the Future of Cities project, opening on 10 February at RIBA\u2019s headquarters. It\u2019s a retrospective, but also a prompt \u2013 to people both in government and out \u2013 to further this process of imagining the future. \u201cThinking about how cities will look and the kind of places we may live in isn\u2019t something that policy-makers typically engage themselves with in such a visual manner,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cI think the idea, really, is to plant the seed within the general public\u2019s mind that they can be co-designers of their future. That they don\u2019t have to just receive something that\u2019s bestowed on them from an architect on high.\u201d The exhibition will also be exploring some of the less visual elements of the Future of Cities project, with an emphasis on re-examining how the UK government relates to its cities, and how those cities relate to one another. \u201cWe\u2019re looking across demography, economics, social sciences; we\u2019re trying to be as broad as possible to understand cities as systems,\u201d says Nick Francis, a researcher at Space Syntax, the urban design and planning firm launched out of University College London. Francis is helping to coordinate the Future of Cities project, and says this systems-based thinking about how cities function will only become more important as cities around the world continue to grow. \u201cHow do all our cities connect? What are the flows of people, trade, traffic between them?\u201d One point that has emerged again and again is the relative lack of autonomy among most cities in the UK. \u201cAs a nation we are one of the most centralised in the world, especially when it comes to cities,\u201d Francis says. He estimates that local governments raise only 17% of their own budgets, with the rest coming from central government. \u201cSo our cities really don\u2019t have a lot of freedom.\u201d It is a model that may be becoming obsolete. In their 2013 book The Metropolitan Revolution: How Cities and Metros are Fixing our Broken Politics and Fragile Economy, Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley of the Washington DC-based Brookings Institution argue that US cities are making progress by tackling those issues that the federal government seems incapable of solving. Some issues, they write, are better addressed at the local or metropolitan level, and in a way it\u2019s a prediction about the future of cities \u2013 one that Francis thinks could benefit cities in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re moving to a place where I think cities are being seen as the more appropriate scale to tackle specific challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that is a positive move.\u201d     Autopia Ampere (1978) was a concept by the late seascape architect Wolf Hilbertz. It uses Biorock \u2013 a mineral accretion technology which fast grows coral and repairs damaged reefs \u2013 developed by scientist Thomas Goreau.  Photograph: Newton Fallis/A Visual History of the Future    By rethinking cities as interconnected parts of a system, Francis suggests the UK may be able to address some of the spatial disparities that have limited the economic potential of cities in the north, for example. \u201cQuite a lot of policy implicitly can end up favouring London and the south-east of the country, and disadvantaging northern cities. It\u2019s not because there\u2019s any sort of malign will there; it\u2019s just because nobody looks at it, so we don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Francis says. \u201cCentral government could make better spatially literate decisions, and I think that would lead to better outcomes.\u201d Visualising the future city \u2013 be it a speculative design for a settlement in the atmosphere, a dystopian sci-fi movie, or a new approach to measuring the economy \u2013 can begin to guide the form and function of the city to be. Francis is hoping to continue this long tradition with a spinoff competition that seeks \u201cgrounded visualisations\u201d of what the future may hold for specific cities. \u201cGetting public responses to that, or asking: \u2018would you like a city that looks like this or a city that looks like this?\u2019 \u2026 I think it would be quite an interesting exercise.\u201d And it\u2019s easier than ever to create those visions of the future, of course. \u201cThere are so many amazing techniques of representation now,\u201d says Dunn. From easily accessible computer software to video games to CGI filmmaking, there\u2019s immense potential to share these ideas in a visual, captivating way. Dunn points out that even lay people are increasingly capable of engaging with the concept of creating a new or different city \u2013 just look at all the millions of children worldwide who are building their own cities in Minecraft. The past visions of the future presented in Dunn\u2019s report are just a small sample of the potential futures our cities may hold. Which is part of the idea behind the Future of Cities project: to bring more ideas to the table, so the best ones might one day come true. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily trying to build consensus with what we\u2019ve written,\u201d Dunn concludes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to just prod people to think about what they want in the future.\u201d", "tags": ["Cities", "Science fiction", "Architecture"], "publicationDate": "2015-02-06T08:00:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/07/scientists-map-bacteria-new-york-city-subways", "sentences": ["The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons."], "title": "Plague, anthrax and cheese? Scientists map bacteria on New York subway", "article": "Like veins carrying the lifeblood of a city, a subway system teems with billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of swiss cheese and kimchi, of bubonic plague and drug-proof bugs and of human skin, guts and waste. Now, for the first time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a city\u2019s subway \u2013 and they have found a wealth of curious results. Dr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that for 18 months swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life-forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. In what Mason called \u201cthe first city-scale genetic profile ever\u201d, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train car and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a garbage bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan. In research published in the journal Cell Systems on Thursday, the team strongly downplayed the findings of plague and anthrax, noting the extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years.  \u201cThe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,\u201d the study says, \u201cnor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk.\u201d       In fact, most of the bacteria identified by the team are either harmless to humans or beneficial in the city\u2019s thriving world of microorganisms, many of which process toxic hazards and waste in the same way that bacteria inside every human help with digestion and bodily functions. Bacteria of the human body also turned up in the researchers\u2019 results, which found that many of the species on the subway are associated with the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts and human skin. Some of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said \u201cshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands\u201d. He also said that many bacteria of the same genus as those \u201cthat are beneficial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese\u201d also turned up around New York. Subway riders are what they eat Bacteria appeared to reflect the eating habits of various neighborhoods. All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses \u2013 brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza \u2013 turned up. The distinctive bacteria of swiss cheese was more localized to midtown Manhattan and the financial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the financial district and Bay Ridge. The computer also identified cucumber DNA all over the city, probably making the closest match it could of diverse, unannotated plant DNA to one of the best studied sequences, Mason said. Bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhea and nausea, both benign and bad E coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary tract infections were common all over the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem. With more than 1,000 samples collected at all of New York\u2019s 466 open subway stations, Mason and his team ran the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and then through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases. They identified 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria. But almost half of those distinct life-forms matched no known organism, Mason said, meaning \u201cthere\u2019s a vast amount of life just under our fingertips waiting to be discovered, something I find very exciting\u201d. Mason admitted, however, that the database still lacks some DNA sequences expected in the subway, such as cockroaches and many species of plants and fungi. Mason also found many bacteria resistant to antibiotics \u2013 those that can cause staph infections were all over the city. Twenty-eight percent of cultured microorganisms yielded colonies resistant to standard antibiotics, and a multi-drug-resistant bacterium was discovered at one station. Mason said that \u201cthis is actually a very normal aspect of a lot of bacteria, they evolve to resist antibiotics evolved by other bacteria\u201d. \u201cSo it\u2019s not too surprising,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that no one every looked at what does the number look like on surfaces in the city.\u201d It\u2019s dirty (and smells), but it\u2019s safe The good news, the researchers wrote, is that these \u201cpotentially infectious agents\u201d are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York, but rather seem to be \u201cnormal cohabitants\u201d and \u201cmay even be essential\u201d and \u201crepresent a normal, \u2018healthy\u2019 metagenome profile of a city\u201d. In short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought. Mason said people should not be concerned getting urinary tract infections from subway seats. \u201cYou should wash your hands,\u201d he said, \u201cand probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym, and that\u2019s about the same today as it was yesterday.\u201d \u201cIf anything,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ve become much more confident riding the subway.\u201d Mason said New Yorkers were mostly unperturbed by his team swabbing around the subway for a year. One passerby hugged a student, thanking them for cleaning the subway and paying no heed to the Q-Tip in the researcher\u2019s hand.

The researchers failed to offer alternative, much more plausible explanations for their findings, which is a common best practice for scientific papers.\u201d Many findings made sense: heavily trafficked stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them; the subway was most enriched for bacteria associated with skin. The Bronx, with its diverse neighborhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with just three stops, had the lowest. The researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry, a station that flooded during Hurricane Sandy \u2013 but were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish. At the Gowanus Canal, an EPA Superfund site with a history of industrial waste, they found bacteria that metabolize methane and sulfur. The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons.

It was an image he actively encouraged. An ordained Church of England minister, Lord Green published a book in 2009 entitled Good Value: Reflections on Money, Morality and an Uncertain World. It preached that business leaders should behave not just legally but ethically, going beyond \u201cwhat you can get away with\u201d.  Today, Green faces awkward questions over the culture of lax controls and failures in compliance at HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank. The Geneva subsidiary that routinely allowed clients to withdraw very large sums of cash and that colluded with some to conceal undeclared \u201cblack\u201d accounts was created on Green\u2019s watch. The son of a Brighton lawyer, Green began his 28-year career at what was then Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1982. By 1998 he had been singled out for promotion by Sir John Bond, the chairman whose leadership set HSBC on the path to becoming Europe\u2019s largest bank. Green was appointed to the board of HSBC group that year, running investment banking, asset management and crucially, private banking. He retained oversight of the private bank until becoming chief executive. A year later, HSBC bought the Republic National Bank of New York, the business that was merged with other HSBC units to become the new Swiss operation. From 2005, Green was afforded an even closer look at the inner workings of the Geneva business as chair of its supervisory company, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA. But he has so far refused to answer questions on the scandal, telling the Guardian: \u201cAs a matter of principle, I will not comment on the business of HSBC, past or present.\u201d The principles Green extolled in his book proposed a different approach to corporate good behaviour. \u201cFor companies, where does this responsibility begin?\u201d he asked. \u201cWith their boards, of course. There is no other task they have which is more important. It is their job \u2013 and one which by its nature will never be complete \u2013 to promote and nurture a culture of ethical and purposeful business throughout the organisation.\u201d           HSBC files: how secret Swiss account data detailing misconduct came to light    Green was chief executive of HSBC group from 2003 until being appointed its chairman in 2006. At David Cameron\u2019s invitation he left to join the House of Lords at the end of 2010, donning ermine as Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint and becoming minister for trade and investment.  Green, who became a Church of England priest in 1988, voluntarily gave up his HSBC bonus during the banking crisis, but after long years at the bank he also amassed a \u00a319m pension pot \u2013 large even by City standards. Despite being richly rewarded for his role, Green has never been grilled over the goings-on in Geneva. On the contrary, he left the private sector to a chorus of praise after steering HSBC safely through the global financial meltdown. Unlike the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC was not forced to turn to British taxpayers for help. As one of the world\u2019s strongest banks, it remained a rare provider of liquidity to the markets and, when in need of cash \u2013 a chunky \u00a312.5bn of it \u2013 investors were more than happy to stump up. \u201cIn Stephen we will be appointing a minister with a long career as a leading international banker,\u201d business secretary Vince Cable trumpeted when Green joined his department in 2011, \u201cone of the few to emerge with credit from the recent financial crisis, and somebody who has set out a powerful philosophy for ethical business.\u201d A source close to Cable said Green\u2019s appointment as trade minister had been made by Cameron. Contacted by the Guardian on Monday as to his view on his former junior ministerin the light of the HSBC revelations, Cable said: \u201cWe simply don\u2019t know at present if Lord Green was aware of or condoned these practices.\u201d Regulators began to catch up with HSBC in 2012, when the US fined the bank $1.9bn for allowing its international branches in Mexico and elsewhere to become a conduit for \u201cdrug kingpins and rogue nations\u201d. With Green leading trade missions to Mexico and Colombia at the time, there were calls from Labour in opposition for a full explanation. But the minister said he had no plans to quit. \u201cHSBC has expressed regret that there were failures at implementation ... and I share that regret,\u201d Green said in a letter to Chris Leslie, financial secretary to the UK Treasury for Labour By the end of 2013, however, Green had left government after two years in post. The prime minister stood by his decision to appoint Green on Monday, saying: \u201cStephen Green was an excellent trade minister, he did a good job.

As I listened, my blood pressure rose and two images came to my mind. The first was the Beijing Olympics in 2008 \u2013 the waving flags and banging drums in perfect unison. Then I thought of the 2012 London Olympics, with all the human stories that reflected our history and values \u2013 a ceremony that was feted around the world for its creativity and wit. But you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that we were in China given the level of prescription in the new proposals for primary mathematics. It was based almost entirely on the Shanghai education policies which Nick Gibb, the schools minister, so much admires. The new, highly prescriptive curriculum for England presents \u2013 in a year-by-year schedule \u2013 the exact maths that teachers have to \u201cdeliver\u201d and even suggests the particular methods and layout children must use. This isn\u2019t enough classroom control for Gibb, though. He wants to prescribe what textbooks teachers should use, too. In November last year, the minister launched the next stage in his reform of the primary maths curriculum. In it, he proposed that all teachers should give every child a Chinese or Singaporean-style textbook and that the teaching of maths should follow directly from these. Children will work through these textbooks in unison, keeping on the same page at the same time, as they do in Shanghai. Gibb has drawn heavily on Why Textbooks Count, a paper written by a favourite adviser Tim Oates, who argues that textbooks from Singapore and China are the answer to our difficulties in teaching maths to five- to 11-year-olds. The theory is that, because the Chinese and Singaporean children all work through a textbook together, no one falls behind. And they think this system should work in the UK. The programme needs the support of British publishers; if every child is to have a Chinese-style textbook, which teachers must use as the \u201cbasis of instruction\u201d, then publishers must either translate them into English or produce imitation copies. This is precisely what was proposed at a meeting held by the DfE last week. The department informed educational publishers that the only model for textbooks were the Chinese and Singaporean ones on show and a list of criteria would be drawn up to which all textbooks \u201cwould have to conform\u201d. Not only is this profoundly undemocratic, but there hasn\u2019t been a shred of evidence that a mass move to textbook-orientated teaching across 100% of English primary schools \u2013 rural and urban, in affluent and poorer areas \u2013 would improve children\u2019s understanding of mathematics. The arguments for the move rely on that fact that some \u201chigh-achieving jurisdictions\u201d, including Shanghai and Singapore, use a system where children work through state-prescribed textbooks. This is the backbone of their maths teaching in primary schools, with children as young as five. Since they do better in international comparisons, it follows that we should copy them. It is true that Shanghai and Singapore appear higher than the UK in the international maths tables. But, as Oates himself points out, it is not only countries with state-prescribed textbooks that do well in these tables: \u201cThere are high-performing jurisdictions which do not use central approval processes (eg Massachusetts) and low ranked jurisdictions that do.\u201d We also don\u2019t know what elements of Shanghai\u2019s education produces good mathematics education. One thing to note, however, is that Chinese teachers have a five-year education training, specifically targeted at teaching primary children, whereas we have systematically cut the time we give to trainee teachers. Indeed, all three comprehensive reports on primary maths in England produced by Ofsted over the last six years have unequivocally stated that excellent teaching produces successful maths learning. We know \u201cexcellent teaching\u201d is a complicated cocktail of good mathematical models, inspiring children to investigate and solve problems and a fundamental base of practice and memorisation. But most of all it requires dedicated professional and stimulating teachers. It\u2019s a great shame that things have come to this. We all want to improve children\u2019s learning and it would be sensible to use the evidence we have from teachers and Ofsted to ensure that all teachers provide a structured programme of excellent teaching. Most primary maths experts would also agree that high-quality, well-researched textbooks are an essential component of that. But we should encourage publishers to produce a variety of textbooks of different types that enable schools to choose ones that fit their teaching and are right for their students. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to improve children\u2019s learning. Worse still, it undermines more important features of our culture and heritage, where we punch above our weight in creativity and celebrate originality and difference rather than uniformity.

In 1982 China\u2019s ministry of health had decided to undertake a massive survey of the country\u2019s diet looking to pinpoint sites of malnutrition and understand where best to target basic food resources. But in the course of their research they discovered that the number of overweight people in China accounted for approximately 7% of the population (by way of contrast, in 1980 it was claimed that 26% of American adults were obese).  Just over a decade later, a 1992 survey suggested that 15% of Chinese people were overweight and approximately 30 million were clinically obese. In other words, the number of overweight Chinese had doubled in a decade. Excessive weight and obesity were now items to be added to China\u2019s ever lengthening healthcare agenda. The 90s saw the government launch the first campaigns around smoking, excessive alcohol intake and tentatively consider the \u2013 still politically sensitive \u2013 adverse effects of pollution on the nation\u2019s health. As China has become richer, so there have been what are known as \u201cwealth deficits\u201d \u2013 a rising awareness of depression as well as Alzheimers and other conditions associated with improved longevity. Obesity has fallen into this group as decades of food scarcity have receded into an era of availability. TV programmes and radio shows discuss the adverse effects of obesity on everything from marriage prospects to students\u2019 exam performance to getting a job. \u201cFat camps\u201d for kids, bogus slimming pills, the massive uptake of liposuction, the explosion of gyms and all manner of quack diets are all the subject of debate and tabloid speculation. Weight and body image are not seen as sensitive subjects by the media censors and so a repressed tabloid media has taken to discussing obesity with a vengeance.     In China the cumulative effects of change in the national diet, rather than \u2018a single identifiable evil\u2019 has triggered obesity. Photograph: Nikhil Patel/Guardian    In the west there has been a tendency to equate the \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d with a single identifiable evil in the diet \u2013 a prime suspect if you like \u2013 trans-fats, junk food and fizzy drinks. But, in China, it is the cumulative change across the national diet that has made the difference.  The fact is that, particularly for China\u2019s urban middle class, diet has changed radically and seemingly definitely in terms of both volume and variety. Access to food has greatly improved \u2013 supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores. At the same time the range of food products has grown, though mostly this has been pre-packaged and processed foods high in fat salt and sugar (HFSS). For instance, the total volume sales of the processed foods and beverages with high quantities of HFSS food products have grown at more than twice the rate of fresh fruit and vegetables sales over the last 15 years. The diet has changed, and urban malnutrition is now virtually extinct, but not necessarily for the better.  As new data revealed China\u2019s growing waistline so the policy of targeting the poor and underfed also became a quest to understand why some people were putting their health at risk by overeating. \u201cFrom famine to gluttony in a generation,\u201d is how one dietician in Guangzhou phrased to me. Another described it as a \u201cwealth benefit\u201d in the new China and that, just as more people owning cars was leading to sky-rocketing accident rates, so the greater availability of, access to, and affordability of food was seeing some Chinese overindulge and gain weight to degrees that were injurious to their health. By 2012 China\u2019s Ministry of Health estimated that as many as 300 million Chinese people are obese in a population of 1.2 billion. This total makes China the second most obese nation after the USA in numbers of overweight citizens.  This rise in obesity translates into a major healthcare policy problem. Recent surveys of obesity and diabetes to date have found that the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes is nearly 10% and 16%, respectively, across China, accounting for 92.4 million adults with diabetes and 148.2 million adults with pre-diabetes. Underdiagnosis is a major concern for healthcare policy planners in China. Diabetes, both type 1 and 2, are believed to be significantly underdiagnosed, while according to the ministry of health, only 30.2% of China\u2019s population is aware of hypertension as a clinical condition (and to many, this seems a high estimate). Due to underdiagnosis, China could potentially be home to many more diabetics, unaware of their condition or unable to access treatment. Their number could be being added to by 1.5 million to 2 million new sufferers per year.     Despite attributing rising obesity levels with lack of physical activity by young people, there has been no more funding for sports for children.  Photograph: Nikhil Patel/Guardian    Chinese healthcare planners are now far more aware of obesity, and the medical problems associated with it, than they were even just five years ago when Ji Chengye, of the Child and Adolescent Health Section of the China Preventive Medicine Association, declared that \u201cChina has entered the era of obesity\u201d. It is now a subject of many studies, media speculation and greater educational awareness. In large part the government has blamed inactivity and sedentary lifestyles as the major culprit. Tian Ye, director of the China Institute of Sports Science, has said the issue of weight and physical decline can be attributed partially to the lack of sports activities among young people but funding for more mass-participation programmes was never forthcoming.  Across the board \u2013 from exercise to diet \u2013 specific funding for obesity awareness programmes remains low to non-existent. In China\u2019s system of rigid central planning of budgetary allocations awareness of a problem can grow, but funding and new approaches are far slower to emerge, due to five year planning cycles. In 2009, as part of China\u2019s $586bn (\u00a3384bn) fiscal stimulus package, the central government budgeted for billions more to go into the healthcare system, in the countryside and cities. However, none of this went to obesity prevention. While the number of researchers in the field has increased ground level activity remains small. According to China\u2019s National Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene in Beijing, the country has just over 10,000 qualified nutritionists nationwide, but needs at least four million, based on international standards of one nutritionist for every 300 people. China still remains legislation-lite when it comes to obesity. In 2007 when new obesity stats made headline news some initiatives were launched \u2013 the central government ordered the building of more playgrounds and passed a law requiring students to exercise or play sports for an hour a day at school. While more playgrounds were built they were often not well thought out and did not encourage more active play, while many schools have disregarded the exercise regulations (often due to parental criticisms of wasted time away from academic studies) or circumvented them by using the time for drilling or simple mass playground exercises.  Similarly, a government initiative to institute mass exercises in workplaces was largely ignored by employers as inappropriate when staff have customers to deal with. At the same time the Chinese Nutrition Society launched a campaign \u2013 Eat Smart at School \u2013 aimed at cultivating healthy eating practices in schools. This emphasis on school meals followed research in Hong Kong where staple lunchtime dishes such as fried rice and noodles were found to be high in fat, cholesterol and sodium. In 2006 Hong Kong launched a campaign entitled EatSmart@school.hk to promote territory-wide healthy eating. The campaign included issuing new nutritional guidelines on school lunch for primary school students to guide caterers to provide balanced diets to 300,000 students in some 600 whole-day primary schools. China followed suit, though only schools in wealthier urban areas have realistically been able to afford the new lunches. However, despite debate, there has been no adoption of any formal legislation regarding TV advertising of fast food or requirements to introduce additional warning labeling to products in the HFSS category.      There is no formal legislation regarding fast food advertising in China. Photograph: Nikhil Patel/Guardian    More recently there appears to have been a rethink on the approach to obesity by the Chinese government. As with other healthcare issues of growing concern \u2013 care of the increasing elderly population for instance \u2013 localised community-based interventions appear to be where resources will be targeted in future. China is currently experimenting with community-based interventions through the National Plan of Action for Nutrition in China. This programme is a mixture of the education and promotion of better diets and lifestyles while also providing incentives to food growers to both produce healthier foods and improve production and hygiene after China\u2019s decade long rash of food scares.  Still, at present, obesity rates \u2013 particularly among children \u2013 are continuing to grow and associated medical conditions, most notably type-2 diabetes, is continuing to add additional strains to an already overstretched national healthcare system. Today\u2019s overweight and obese in China can look forward to a mixed future of bright economic hopes for their country, but all too often, poor and deteriorating health for themselves. Many of China\u2019s young obese are about to hit healthcare problems associated with being overweight in middle age.    Related: From child hunger to obesity: Brazil's new health scourge    According to a 2012 survey undertaken by the Children\u2019s Hospital of Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University, the number of Chinese children under 14 suffering from diabetes is growing fast and has almost tripled over the past 25 years representing a significant rise in Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). MODY leads to more type 2 diabetes, caused by the wearing out of insulin-producing cells normally associated with the natural ageing process, in younger and younger patients. As well as more incidences of type 2 diabetes in the young, it also means that more cases of heart disease, strokes and kidney failure \u2013 problems caused by diabetes \u2013 will develop in ever younger people. Put quite simply, what was once a chronic disease of midlife in China is now a paediatric problem occurring in children as young as ten. All this will impact significantly on China\u2019s heathcare budget in the future.

On Thursday the Labour party pledged that if elected it would cap class sizes at 30 for pupils aged five to seven years. By contrast, last week the head of the OECD Program of International Student Assessment (Pisa) surveys, Andreas Schleicher, set out the seven big myths about top-performing school systems, with myth number four being that small classes raise standards. This can\u2019t be right, he argues, because high-performing education systems like those in east Asia focus on better teachers, not class sizes.   Related: Ed Miliband: Labour would restore Blair-era cap on class sizes    These two attitudes reflect opposite sides of a longstanding and angry debate which resurfaces at regular intervals. On the one hand we have teachers, unions, parents and some academics arguing that smaller classes allow better teaching and learning; on the other are many policymakers, politicians and advisers, as well as some academics, who argue that class size is not important. Despite the Labour party pledge, my impression is that this latter perspective is gaining ground. As well as the OECD, the view is reflected in the influential Sutton Trust toolkit, and in a number of weighty reports by, among others, McKinsey &amp; Company, the Grattan Institute, and the Brookings Institution. How do we reconcile these two different approaches? Are teachers wrong and self-serving, as some commentators imply? To address this question we need to examine the evidence on the relationship between class size and pupil performance. As someone who has researched this for some time, I am struck by how those in favour of larger classes rely on three main sources of data: cross-national comparisons, \u201cmeta-analyses\u201d and econometric analysis. Yet all of these offer only a partial view and are not conclusive on the causal role of class size. Results from Pisa are a case in point. These show that students in east Asian regions like Shanghai and Hong Kong do very well on school tests and also have relatively large classes; it is therefore concluded by many that class size is not important to academic achievement. But the flaw in this argument is that there are a host of reasons why high-performing Asian education systems do well, including high levels of parental support, cultural factors that favour education, and the prevalence of private tutoring. The causal effect \u2013 or not \u2013 of class size therefore cannot be inferred.    Class size does matter for the younger pupils in the first two to four years in school    So called \u201cmeta-analyses\u201d, such as the well-known one by professor John Hattie have also been persuasive. They involve large-scale statistical analysis of multiple studies which address the effects of class size. The conclusions have generally been that class size does not have a major influence on student learning. Yet often these analyses are based on studies of such varying quality, and with variable parameters \u2013 age of pupils and research design, for example \u2013 that it is difficult to arrive at sound conclusions. A similar problem exists with econometric analyses \u2013 studies by economists who often take measures of class size, or more usually pupil-teacher ratios (which is not the same thing), and develop statistical models of effects that take little account of what actually happens in school. Interestingly, these sources of data are all secondary analyses; that is, they use data collected by other people and are often not designed to study class size at all. What is needed are dedicated studies of class-size effects which carefully control for potentially confounding factors like pupil and teacher characteristics. There are very few such studies. Perhaps the two most reliable and large-scale ones \u2013 the Student/teacher achievement ratio (Star) experimental project from Tennessee, and the Class size and pupil adult ratio (CSPAR) longitudinal study, which I directed at the Institute of Education (IoE) \u2013 arrive at similar conclusions: class size does matter for the younger pupils in the first two to four years in school, and small classes are particularly beneficial for the more disadvantaged and initially lower-attaining pupils. It is sometimes argued that class sizes have to become smaller than 20 for any noticeable effect, but in the IoE study we were able to show that there was no such threshold; the effects of class size continued in a linear way across the range of class sizes. But in any case, the debate over class size has become tired and formulaic, and is hampered by significant limitations. One is that the focus on class size and academic performance overlooks the effect of class size on other aspects of classroom life, such as relationships, discipline and catering for pupils with special educational needs. Again, there are few studies, but careful moment-by-moment systematic observation of pupils shows that class size affects the amount of individual attention pupils receive, and their engagement and active involvement in class.    Class sizes and teaching are not mutually exclusive    In a recent IoE study we found that lower-attaining secondary pupils were more likely to be off task in larger classes when compared to middle- and high-attaining pupils. Intriguingly, in high-performing east Asian countries like China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there has been a move recently to introduce smaller classes. This is not to improve academic attainment, but to help with a move from teacher-directed to student-centred approaches that aim to meet individual pupils\u2019 diverse educational needs, and to develop critical thinking and collaborative approaches. So performance on tests is not the only worthwhile educational outcome; there are other pupil outcomes and classroom processes that can be influenced by class size. The second limitation of much of this debate is that it sets up the issue as a binary choice: either invest in class sizes or in teaching. But these are not mutually exclusive. All teaching and learning takes place within a context, and one important feature of school classrooms is the number of pupils in a class. We can all agree that the quality of teaching is vital, but smaller classes can help teachers provide a more effective education. This is appreciated far more in east Asia than the west, as is the realisation that the benefits of class-size reduction will not happen automatically, but will require careful attention and professional development if we are to make the most of the opportunities that smaller classes offer. Instead of focusing on the relationship between class size and pupil attainment, we should be looking at the relationship between class size and effective teaching.", "tags": ["Education", "Children", "Society", "School tables", "Schools", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2015-02-13T15:20:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/14/china-corruption-crackdown-spreads-xi-jinping", "sentences": ["Luxury shopping in Shanghai: but China\u2019s recent economic slowdown has been partly attributed to President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-corruption crackdown.", "Li Hui, an anti-corruption expert and politics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, praised \u201ca nice beginning\u201d to a long-term shift, instead of seeing it as a one-off movement."], "title": "Politburo, army, casinos: China\u2019s corruption crackdown spreads", "article": "China\u2019s long and largely unavailing battle with corruption is dotted with notorious officials. Take Heshen, still a byword for misbehaviour: a Qing dynasty figure who seemed unassailable despite his conspicuous greed and soaring wealth. When emperor Qianlong died in 1799, the fall of his favourite was as swift as his rise had been remarkable. Heshen was charged and forced to kill himself; his family\u2019s vast fortune was confiscated. Now his modern-day counterparts are learning his painful lesson: that a change in regime can spell a swift end to the comfortable status quo. In recent decades, top leaders warned that the Communist party faced a life-and-death fight to root out abuses while cadre members and their families amassed ever greater assets: luxury properties at home and abroad; sports cars and designer wardrobes; stacks of cash and stakes in major companies. But since China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, took power two years ago, his pledge to bring down both \u201cflies and tigers\u201d \u2013 corrupt cadres at all levels \u2013 has demonstrated real bite. Authorities say 100,000 officials have been punished so far. Others seem willing to do anything to avoid investigation; recently, the party launched a nationwide survey of suicides among its 87 million members. While there is concern that some reported cases have been a cover for deaths during gruelling internal party interrogations, there have also been graphic tales of people attempting suicide as anti-graft teams arrived, hoping to protect their families not just from disgrace but from losing their property and positions. Privately, both officials and businesses warn that day-to-day work is simply grinding to a halt: officials lack other incentives to act, no longer know how to navigate the paths of power to get things done, or are worried that any decision \u2013 however legitimate \u2013 will attract unwanted attention. The official People\u2019s Daily quoted Hebei province\u2019s party secretary as warning: \u201cI am afraid that too much punishment of senior officials could harm the stability and development of the local economy.\u201d Some even think the campaign is playing a part in China\u2019s lower growth figures. \u201cThe slowdown of economic growth, to a certain degree, is related to cadres slacking off,\u201d said Sheng Hong, executive director of the Unirule Institute of Economics. The sensitivity of anti-corruption officials to such remarks is evident in a commentary posted on their website last week. It said that such opinions showed a lack of understanding about the changing pattern of economic development, a failure to comprehend the \u201cgrave and complex\u201d situation regarding power abuses, or ulterior motives. The assumption has been that eradicating corruption can only mean a swift improvement in the system. In fact, crackdowns tend to come at a cost, says Dan Hough, an expert on anti-corruption initiatives at the University of Sussex. \u201cOften it does lead to negative economic and social consequences. You have to take that medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople freeze. They are not sure what the new rules of the game are \u2026 It will take time before a consensus emerges.\u201d The drive has been more prolonged and far-reaching than anyone anticipated. In September, the party boss of Nanjing, one of China\u2019s biggest cities, praised the initiative in the People\u2019s Daily: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a good official for a short period, but to remain a good official for a lifetime is much harder,\u201d said Yang Weize. Apparently he spoke from personal experience. In January, he too was detained. The campaign\u2019s scope reflects not just cynicism among the public about endemic corruption, but an understanding of how deep and entrenched government-business ties have become: \u201cI think the current Chinese leadership realised that the lethal mix of power and money is a grave danger to the legitimacy of the party,\u201d said Xiaobo L\u00fc, an expert on Chinese politics at Columbia University in New York. Even if Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao, shared that concern, he was a weaker figure who relied on collective leadership: \u201cHe did not, and probably could not, take on the entrenched interests \u2013 ie corrupt crony capitalism \u2013 head-on,\u201d said L\u00fc. China watchers previously assumed that an unwritten accord prevented corruption charges against any member or former member of the politburo standing committee, the country\u2019s top political body. Yet Xi has overseen the arrest of Zhou Yongkang, the former security tsar; on 9 February, Liu Han, a mining billionaire widely reported to have ties with Zhou, was executed for committing multiple murders.     Luxury shopping in Shanghai: but China\u2019s recent economic slowdown has been partly attributed to President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-corruption crackdown. Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis    The campaign has swept across the army, claiming even Xu Caihou, former vice-chair of the central military commission and a politburo member, now charged with taking \u201chuge amounts of bribes\u201d in exchange for promotions. It has spread to finance, with the arrest of the president of the Minsheng Bank and investigation of a Bank of Beijing board member. Spymaster Ma Jian, a deputy head at the ministry of state security, was reportedly detained last month. Not long before, the discipline watchdog began investigating the top sports body; subsequently, a top official there vowed to toughen the fight against corruption in the television and film industry. The graft-busting body \u2013 the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection \u2013 has dramatically expanded its power and reach: \u201cNever has the CCDI, whose job used to be solely related to clean governance, been involved so deeply in the country\u2019s overall administration,\u201d wrote analyst Willy Lam in a piece for the Jamestown Foundation. \u201cWhile President Xi\u2019s commitment to clean governance does not seem to be in doubt, he and the CCDI\u2019s Wang [Qishan] need to do more to convince the public that they have not been using one of China\u2019s most powerful organs to consolidate their power and to decimate political foes.\u201d Wang, who has headed the anti-corruption fight for Xi, is highly regarded for his abilities; he is also a fan of the US drama House of Cards, which perhaps encourages speculation about machiavellian manoeuvring. Both men have a deep knowledge of internal party dynamics as well as seasoned political skills; and now, it seems, they have public opinion behind them. \u201cIt is a power struggle rather than a genuine crackdown on corruption. In other words, it is a campaign to marginalise opponents in the name of anti-corruption,\u201d argued Zhang Lifan, a Beijing-based independent historian. Zhou was a relatively easy target, despite his elevated position: he had few allies and was made suspect by his ties with the ambitious politician Bo Xilai, toppled spectacularly and charged with corruption and power abuses after his wife was accused (and later convicted) of murdering Briton Neil Heywood. Not only that, says novelist Murong Xuecun, but Zhou had scrambled to power from a humble background, while the \u201csecond generation reds\u201d who, like Xi, were born to veteran communist families, seem mostly unscathed. \u201cThose groups that support and pledge loyalty to Mr Xi appear untouched,\u201d the novelist wrote last month. Most striking has been the long investigation into Ling Jihua, formerly a top aide to Hu. Yet few doubt that the leadership is genuinely concerned about the challenge that corruption poses to its credibility and the country\u2019s ability to function. General Liu Yuan \u2013 known for his outspoken denunciations of military graft \u2013 warned recently that graft was the number one killer of combat effectiveness. Corruption entrenches and widens economic inequality; it disproportionately affects the poor. They are the ones whose homes are torn down for minimal compensation when property developers buy off local officials. Watching a parade of officials being shamed offers at the least a sense of vengeance, at best a hope of future justice. But while the \u201ctigers\u201d dominate the headlines, it is often the actions of low-level \u201cflies\u201d that have more impact on people. \u201cWith decentralisation and the growth of the market, lower level officials in a local county branch have a lot more power [than in the past],\u201d noted Deng Xiaogang of the University of Massachusetts in Boston, who holds a fellowship from Harvard\u2019s Edmond J Safra centre for ethics to study institutional corruption. \u201cIf you want to find a job or do a small business transaction, you need this kind of personal network \u2026 It\u2019s about who you know so your child can go to a better middle school; so your relative can see a better doctor when he has cancer. It could be about [passing] hygiene inspections if you sell food. It\u2019s become part of Chinese culture. People take it for granted; it becomes routinised and people may not feel it because it is part of daily reality.\u201d Some misbehaviour has gone underground. But the campaign has had real impact. It has been blamed for plummeting casino revenues in Macau and falling sales of everything from expensive spirits to Tibetan mastiffs: the fierce dogs, which previously sold for hundreds of thousands of yuan, were fashionable gifts for businessmen seeking to woo high officials. On Wednesday, the World Gold Council cited its strong impact on sales, down 38% in 2014. Some hotels have even downgraded their five-star ratings to win back custom. \u201cAnti-corruption has become a \u2018new normal\u2019 in China,\u201d an editorial in the official Global Times newspaper announced on Friday. The length of the campaign in part may indicate the time it is taking to unravel the patronage networks that have formed. Corruption patterns have become more complex, sophisticated and deep-rooted. One case leads to another. But it might also reflect the resistance from those who have benefited from the existing system and face losing everything. \u201cIt now seems very difficult to conclude the crackdown \u2013 the initiators may face a backlash if they fail to root out all the other tigers,\u201d warned Zhang Lifan. At the same time, the leadership faces further public disaffection if its efforts halt too abruptly. Li Hui, an anti-corruption expert and politics professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, praised \u201ca nice beginning\u201d to a long-term shift, instead of seeing it as a one-off movement. He ticked off efforts being made to ensure permanent improvement: from making budgeting more transparent and regulating officials\u2019 expenses to establishing a property registration system. But he agreed: \u201cThe next step is to introduce institution-building and rule of law. The government will need to further restrain its power and scrap unnecessary administrative examination and approval items.\u201d Others argue a powerful independent investigator is needed \u2013 something that would be anathema to the party. Xi seems to have turned his back on any prospect of political reform: the last two years have seen an ideological tightening and consolidation of party control. Sheng said greater scrutiny was needed from outside the system, such as from the press and public. The high-profile figures who have been ousted are just a fraction of those involved in wrongdoing, he warned. \u201cThe public love to see corrupt officials being brought down. But the system that makes corruption possible remains unaffected by the crackdown.\u201d Additional research by Luna Lin  FALLEN TIGERS Xu Caihou Xu Caihou, retired vice-chairman of the central military commission, is the highest-profile military leader to face prosecution in recent years. State media said the 71-year-old former general, who was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2013, had accepted \u201chuge bribes personally and through his family, and \u2026 sought profits for others in exchange for bribes\u201d. Reports said it took 14 trucks to carry away the cash and treasures from his luxury villa - including a solid gold statue of Mao Zedong and 20 crates of expensive liquor. Zhou Yongkang Once a member of the politburo standing committee, the country\u2019s most powerful political body, Zhou is the biggest \u201ctiger\u201d caught in the crackdown. The former security chief was arrested and expelled from the party in December 2014, after months of speculation \u2013 and heavy hints \u2013 about his case. A trial date has yet to be set; according to state media his suspected crimes include abusing power, leaking party and state secrets and committing adultery. The party\u2019s official newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, has branded him a traitor. Ling Jihua The terse announcement of the investigation into Ling Jihua\u2019s \u201csuspected serious disciplinary violation\u201d, shortly before Christmas, came as little surprise. Several of his relatives and close contacts, including two of his brothers, had been detained. Ling was vice-chairman of the Chinese people\u2019s political consultative conference committee and former president Hu Jintao\u2019s senior aide. A question had hung over him since the attempted cover-up of a mysterious Ferrari crash in March 2012, in which his only son died.     Jiang Jemin. Photograph: Bobby Yip/Bobby Yip/Reuters/Corbis    Jiang Jiemin Jiang Jiemin, a close ally of Zhou, was a politburo member and head of the powerful state-owned assets supervision and administration commission before he was fired in 2013. He was later expelled from the Communist party and his case has been handed to prosecutors. The South China Morning Post reported he was earlier questioned over payments made by a state-owned company to the families of passengers in the Ferrari crash that killed Ling\u2019s son. Liu Tienan Liu Tienan, the disgraced deputy director of the top economic planning agency, was sentenced to life for bribery in December after his mistress gave incriminating information to a well-known journalist who posted allegations of questionable business deals and even death threats online.

It\u2019s by the bus station, next to a homeless shelter, on the site of a corner shop. The company\u2019s other offices are in rather more glamorous surroundings: Canary Wharf, Hong Kong, Singapore and Abu Dhabi. But this opening is evidence of the dramatic transformation under way in the Nine Elms area in Battersea, on the south bank of the Thames. In a triangle bordered by the river, Battersea Park and the main railway line into Waterloo, 20,000 homes are being built \u2013 most of them luxury apartments in a cluster of high-rise towers that has been dubbed mini-Manhattan or Dubai-on-Thames. \u201cWe will handle the odd instruction between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a31m, but we are pitching this office at properties worth \u00a31m-plus,\u201d says Henry Wiltshire sales director Kyle Spence. \u201cWe are a very high-end brand.\u201d They chose the area \u201cbecause so many of our clients in Canary Wharf are now buying in Nine Elms as well\u201d. Central London could soon have a glut of expensive new homes. Using figures from researchers Lonres and Dataloft, consultancy Property Vision reckons more than 54,000 homes are planned or being built in prime areas of the capital, most of them costing more than \u00a31m. This is despite the fact that last year, just 3,900 homes worth \u00a31m or more were sold in central London. Across London, more than 200 tall towers have been proposed, approved or are already under construction.    Property Vision founder Charlie Ellingworth says: \u201cLondoners are beginning to discern a skyline that is quite out of scale with anything they are used to.\u201d And while local buyers are \u201csqueezed further out and into ever smaller spaces with mortgages they are not quite sure how they will ever repay\u201d, the property business is booming. \u201cFor developers and their dependent ecosystem of estate agents, architects, lawyers and builders, it has been a one-way super-bet.\u201d About \u00a315bn of investment is pouring into the Nine Elms area, which is directly across the river from super-swanky Chelsea but was until recently wasteland, sheds and warehouses. This is the biggest building site in London, and one of the largest regeneration projects in Europe, easily eclipsing the \u00a39bn cost of the 2012 Olympics site in Stratford. Ravi Govindia, the Conservative leader of Wandsworth council, is very upbeat: \u201cYes, some of the buildings will be tall, but there will be a distinctly London flavour. It\u2019s going to be a place that people [will] enjoy living in.\u201d But it is unclear how many of the buyers who get to enjoy that distinctly London flavour will be local people.     Battersea Power Station is at the heart of the project. Photograph: Martin Godwin    At the heart of the development is Battersea power station, which lay derelict for three decades before its Malaysian owners came up with an \u00a38bn facelift plan. Several developers have tried and failed to restore the grade II-listed 1930s landmark, which is so vast St Paul\u2019s cathedral could fit comfortably inside it. Rob Tincknell, who runs the Battersea Power Station Development Company, set up by the Malaysian consortium, says the proposal \u2013 to fill the power station with shops, offices, luxury apartments and \u00a330m-plus penthouses, and surround it with yet more apartment blocks, all designed by star architects Lord Foster and Frank Gehry \u2013 \u201cwas the last chance to save it\u201d.    'The power station will become a big Westfield with a shopping centre inside'  Keith Garner, Battersea Power Station Community Group     But not everyone agrees. Keith Garner, a local architect and a member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group (BPSCG), which campaigns against the project, says: \u201cThis famous London landmark will disappear behind this wall of flats. And the housing isn\u2019t very nice \u2013 it\u2019s crammed in. The power station will become a big Westfield with a shopping centre inside.\u201d But Tincknell says the height of the new buildings will be capped at 60\u00a0metres, which means the brick colossus\u2019s four white chimneys will be visible from afar. \u201cIt\u2019s these things,\u201d he says, pointing at the luxury flats on a scale model of the power station, \u201cthat are paying for this [the restoration]. You don\u2019t just regenerate this out of thin air.\u201d Faced with a barrage of criticism when most of the first phase of 865 flats were sold to overseas buyers, many from Asia, the developers marketed the second lot of 254 homes only in London. But for the third tranche, of 539 apartments, a marketing campaign ran in Tokyo, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur, and there were celebrity-studded launch parties in New York and Los Angeles. State-imposed curbs on second-home purchases in Beijing and Shanghai may have further fuelled Asian interest in London. Tincknell insists that of the 1,300 homes sold so far, two-thirds have gone to UK buyers, and that \u201cpeople are coming over the river from Chelsea\u201d. But Angela Parkinson, a local resident and BPSCG campaigner, is not impressed: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a \u2018buy to leave\u2019 business. These flat are just deposit boxes for buyers taking advantage of the rising value of property in London.\u201d One of the newest blocks in the area seems to bear this out. Look up, any night, at the 52-storey Vauxhall Tower, completed in 2013, and most of the flats are in darkness.    Look up, any night, at the 52-storey Vauxhall Tower, completed in 2013, and most of the flats are in darkness    Govindia says the Nine Elms area was \u201calmost a blank slate\u201d before the diggers moved in four years ago. But it was not entirely wasteland. The famous flower market, part of New Covent Garden, Britain\u2019s biggest wholesale market, is to be demolished to make way for three towers of flats, shops and offices. The market traders petitioned unsuccessfully against the \u00a32bn redevelopment. A big Sainsbury\u2019s was also knocked down and the grocer is now developing, with housebuilder Barratt, a new store and seven towers with a total of 737 homes. This is the supermarket chain\u2019s biggest housing project, and when the flats went on the market last autumn, 11 were sold in the first eight minutes. Landmark Victorian gasholders have also been sold off by National Grid to make way for new homes. Huge amounts of foreign money are pouring into London. Chinese property company Dalian Wanda is constructing one of Europe\u2019s tallest residential buildings at One Nine Elms. Two towers of 60 and 45 storeys respectively and linked by a walkway will house 491 flats, including 52 affordable homes and a five-star hotel. The only higher homes in London will be those at the top of the Shard. The affordable housing in the projects is limited, however. At Keybridge House in Vauxhall, where BT is demolishing a telephone exchange to build five high-rise blocks, the 419 new flats include just 19 affordable homes. At 4.5% of the total, this is far short of the local Lambeth council\u2019s affordable target of 40%. The Labour leader of Lambeth council, Lib Peck, acknowledges this, but points out that the new affordable homes will be of a very high standard and \u201cbig enough for families\u201d and that a new primary school will also be built. Having had their budgets slashed as part of the government\u2019s austerity drive, local authorities are increasingly reliant on property developers to help plug gaps.     An apartment block under construction in Nine Elms. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images    Of the planned 3,444 new homes at the power station 560, or 16%, will be affordable. But that includes intermediate rent properties, which are pitched at 80% of market rates and require a family income of at least \u00a338,000 a year. When Labour members of the London Assembly attacked the drive to sell the power station flats to wealthy foreigners, saying they were \u201ca million miles from affordable to ordinary Londoners\u201d, London mayor Boris Johnson called the critics \u201cgloomadon poppers\u201d, adding that \u201c600 hundred affordable homes are better than no affordable homes\u201d. He also pointed out that the Malaysian developers were contributing \u00a3200m towards the cost of the London Underground extension that will serve the development. Tony Travers, director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, says: \u201cIn fairness, the developer is being required to pay for a lot of other things. The land has to be used very intensely to produce enough yield to pay for the things that the government used to pay for.\u201d    Labour Assembly members say the power station flats are 'a million miles from affordable to ordinary Londoners'    The government could, he points out, have made Battersea power station a designated area of affordable and social housing. \u201cBut then the government would have had to pay for it.\u201d Many flats were sold off-plan and, still unbuilt, are back on the market at higher prices. Just before Christmas one unbuilt studio flat in the power station, which had sold for close to \u00a31m, was back on the market for \u00a31.4m. Last week, estate agent Chestertons was reported to have other unbuilt flats on the market for \u00a3865,000 \u2013 \u00a3150,000 more than their original asking price. The initial buyers never paid the full purchase price, just a deposit of up to 20%; the new buyers then take over next-stage payments. Govindia stresses that the Nine Elms revamp will bring 25,000 permanent jobs plus 20,000 construction and engineering jobs during the building phase, as well as launching a new cultural hub. This year, Damien Hirst is opening a gallery to house his art collection in a row of converted theatre warehouses, stretching along an entire street in Vauxhall. But there has been criticism on other grounds, such as the lack of a masterplan for area. Rowan Moore, Observer architecture critic and author of Why We Build, says the new buildings don\u2019t speak to each other. Sir Simon Jenkins, former chairman of the National Trust, has warned that the Thames riverside is turning into \u201ca wall of glass from Bermondsey to Battersea\u201d. Travers of the LSE talks of \u201cHong Kongification\u201d and says London\u2019s skyline \u201chas never been protected the way Paris\u2019s skyline has\u201d. He says the high density of London housing is partly the fault of the green belt, which prevents the capital sprawling into the countryside. He adds: \u201cYou can get quite high densities without building towers,\u201d pointing to blocks of social housing in Earls Court and Pimlico. And, like Moore, Travers also questions whether the Nine Elms towers are going to look good, compared with the skyscrapers further east: \u201cThe City of London has more different shapes. As a cluster, it has some kind of pizzazz.\u201d ALL CHANGE \u25a0 The transformation of Nine Elms from urban no-man\u2019s-land to \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d started in 2008, when the US embassy decided to move there from Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, north of the river. The Dutch embassy in west London is now following suit. \u25a0 Another catalyst was the rescue of Battersea power station by a Malaysian consortium, which bought the 42-acre London landmark for \u00a3400m after it had fallen into administration in 2011. \u25a0 The final boost came last October, when the Northern Line extension was given the green light. The area will have two new tube stations and will be 15 minutes from central London.", "tags": ["Construction industry", "Housing market", "Housing", "Property", "London", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2015-02-14T16:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/15/ukraine-is-pointing-in-the-direction-of-a-new-world-order", "sentences": ["Putin\u2019s idea of a \u201cgreater Europe from Dublin to Vladivostok\u201d, which he was seeking to sell to the European, particularly German business community, only five years ago, is being replaced by the reality of Russia\u2019s increasing closeness to China and the rise of what can be called a \u201cgreater Asia from Shanghai to St Petersburg\u201d.", "Apart from China, it is trying to expand ties to India, which is also joining this year the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation."], "title": "Ukraine points towards the start of a tumultuous new era in world politics | Dmitri Trenin", "article": "After the ceasefire negotiated in Minsk, a peace settlement in eastern Ukraine remains distant.

The most one can hope for is that the conflict is frozen and people stop dying. Even that, however, cannot be taken for granted, as continued fighting ahead of the ceasefire\u2019s formal entry into force suggests. If the truce sticks, it will be the first negotiated arrangement in a newly divided Europe, leaving Russia almost alone on the east, with much of the rest of Europe supporting Ukraine. This split can grow much worse if the conflict in Donbass continues. But even if it stops, reconciliation is not on the cards. This means that in the foreseeable future there will be no common security system on the continent of Europe, no commonly agreed-upon norms and no rules of behaviour. The world disorder has entered the recently most stable and best-regulated part of the globe: Europe. The idea that a combination of western sanctions and the low oil price can bring a change in Kremlin policies, or a change in the Kremlin itself, has so far not been borne out by the facts. Putin remains defiant, the elites do not turn against him, and his popularity among the bulk of the Russian people, despite the hardships they have begun to feel, is at record levels. These people are not ignorant of the dangers a continued conflict over Ukraine can pose to them, but lay the blame for these on Kiev, Washington and the European leaders. Putin, whether as war leader or a peacemaker, is their champion. At Minsk, he has achieved his minimal goal. Kiev has conceded the failure of its efforts to wipe out the Donbass rebels backed by Moscow. If the ceasefire becomes permanent, the \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d will be physically safe and can start turning themselves into functioning entities on the models of Transnistria. Russia will need to supply them with more than weapons and humanitarian assistance, straining its resources even more, but there\u2019s hardly an alternative. For Putin, and most Russians, these are \u201cour people\u201d. Yet, in Minsk, Putin reaffirmed Russia\u2019s official position that Donbass should remain part of Ukraine. This is not a concession. Within a formally unified Ukraine, Donetsk and Lugansk are a protected centre of resistance to the political leadership in Kiev. The situation in the rest of the country permitting, they can expand their influence beyond Donbass and link up with those who, a year after the triumph of the Maidan, have become disillusioned with their government, which is woefully unable to tame corruption and improve the lives of ordinary Ukrainians. Indeed, if the truce in the east of the country holds, the future of Ukraine will depend on how it manages reform and popular discontent. Russia has not so much \u201clost Ukraine\u201d, as, at least for the time being, its European option. The recent joint trip of chancellor Angela Merkel and president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to Moscow, which paved the road to Minsk, is a rare top-level visit to Russia by western leaders these days. The German-Russian relationship, a mainstay of Europe\u2019s post-cold war stability, has dangerously frayed. With politics adversarial and history divisive, the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War has led to controversies, with a number of politicians in Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine seeking to minimise the Soviet Union\u2019s contribution to the defeat of Nazism or accusing the Soviets of crimes to exonerate those who sided with Hitler against Stalin. Thus, as a result of the Ukraine conflict, the gulf between Russia and the European Union is wide, deep and growing. The Russian government does not expect the lifting of EU sanctions for a long time and, even then, it is hard to expect business as before. Putin\u2019s idea of a \u201cgreater Europe from Dublin to Vladivostok\u201d, which he was seeking to sell to the European, particularly German business community, only five years ago, is being replaced by the reality of Russia\u2019s increasing closeness to China and the rise of what can be called a \u201cgreater Asia from Shanghai to St Petersburg\u201d. When Putin reviews the Victory Day military parade on 9 May, his most honoured guest will be the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, with Barack Obama and most other western leaders boycotting the celebration. De facto expelled from the G8, in confrontation with the United States and with its European option closed, Russia is not isolated elsewhere. Apart from China, it is trying to expand ties to India, which is also joining this year the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. When Putin hosts the twin summits of Brics and SCO in Ufa in July, he will be in the chair of the two most prominent clubs of the non-western world. Thanks to China\u2019s economic and financial might, and Russia\u2019s international experience, these clubs have a potential for evolving into serious organisations capable of providing a measure of financial and political leadership. It is not all symbolism. In a dramatic move, Russia has dropped Gazprom\u2019s pet project, the South Stream, in favour of a gas pipeline running through Turkey to meet the EU on the Greek border. Turkey, a Nato member and US ally, is strengthening economic links to Russia. So is, albeit more quietly, South Korea, another key US ally. Prime minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has not given up on his vision of a normalised and economically vibrant relationship with Russia. In the Middle East, Russia has intensified its outreach to Iran and Egypt, while keeping active relations with Israel and courting Saudi Arabia, not to count its involvement in Syria, of course. From Latin America to south-east Asia to Pakistan, Russia has been looking for customers for its newly revived defence industry. Ukraine is not the centre of the geopolitical universe, neither is Russia central to the future of the globe. Yet, Ukraine and the global crisis over it point to the start of a new period in world politics. Great powers \u2013 Russia overtly, China covertly \u2013 are challenging the US-dominated order. Nationalism, on the rise in places from Turkey to India to Japan, leads to a further erosion of that order. Attempts to degrade and destroy Islamic State have yielded only partial, reversible results. Having lost Russia as a partner and gained Ukraine as a new responsibility, Europe is uncertain what to do. Germany has provided a modicum of diplomatic leadership to the EU as a whole, but the larger issue of strategic goals and how to achieve them has not been properly addressed. Europe, an island of stability and peace for the last quarter-century, is rejoining the world.

In it, four masked \u2018rooftoppers\u2019 hijacked the feed of the enormous LED screen on top of the 52-storey China Online Centre by splicing into the control panel with a laptop. They looped on to the enormous screen a spine-chilling video of the same individuals climbing the under-construction Shanghai Tower in Beijing over a sea of early-morning fog, then filmed themselves watching the illegal screening from a drone.  The spectacle concluded, we follow the masked men as they jet down the stairs of the China Online Centre, change clothes in the stairwell and calmly walk out of the lobby like a scene from Mission Impossible. Vadim Makharov and Vitaly Raskalov, the orchestrators of this meta-selfie, are part of a loose network of people who used to be called urban explorers. But the practice of urban exploration has now splintered under the weight of relentless media attention, crackdowns by authorities and attempts at marketing exploitation \u2013 reforming along divergent lines.          Video: What\u2019s up Hong Kong? by Vadim Makharov and Vitaliy Raskalov    One of those lines is \u2018rooftopping\u2019, a practice of accessing rooftops to take dizzying skyline photography, often peppered with symbolic political messages and displays of bravado imported from parkour. Many will have encountered the Channel 4 documentary Don\u2019t Look Down, featuring James Kingston, a free-runner turned explorer, who can be seen all over the internet hanging one-handed from construction cranes and doing somersaults in precarious places.     Newcomers can amass hundreds of thousands of followers by posting photos of their dirty sneakers dangling off buildings    Rooftopping, or \u2018buildering\u2019 as yet another variant is called, is nothing new. A 1937 book called The Night Climbers of Cambridge was full of photographs of agile young men (exclusively) climbing up drainpipes, over fences and balancing atop the spires of the old colleges.  In recent years rooftopping has spiked in popularity, attracting a more diverse set of practitioners. As an ethnographer who has studied urban exploration cultures around the world since 2008, each day I awake to new sets of click-bait assemblages with titles such as The 10 Most Death-Defying Rooftopping Photos or Heart-stopping Pictures of Daredevils Risking Their Lives trending in my social media feeds.     Scaling Battersea Power Station in London. Photograph: Bradley L Garrett    This bloated exposure was recently ruptured by three events in rapid succession. First, the pseudonymous climber Mustang Wanted repainted a Soviet star on one of Moscow\u2019s Stalin-era Seven Sisters skyscrapers in Ukrainian colours and topped it with a flag, to the delight of Pussy Riot. Soon after, I got a message from a rooftopper in New York City telling me that the whole scene there was on lockdown after two German artists, Mischa Leinkauf and Matthias Wermke, put white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge and that the FBI were dragging urban explorers in for questioning. Finally, three explorers were arrested earlier this month in Toronto, arguably the most historically relaxed city for rooftopping, and are headed to court to answer multiple charges including breaking and entering, and \u201cmischief\u201d. It is clear that rooftoppers have been taking increasing physical and legal risks in recent years. Adrian Chen, in an article on the Outlaw Instagrammers of New York City, argues that younger generations of rooftoppers see the practice as a quick way to internet stardom. Relative newcomers to the scene can amass hundreds of thousands of followers in mere months by posting photos of their dirty sneakers dangling off buildings or, even better, photos of themselves dangling off buildings. Not long before before the Toronto arrests, a well-respected local explorer, Neil Ta, announced he was retiring from rooftopping precisely because of this behaviour:  Something fundamentally changed when it became less about just going up and having a good time with friends and more about who can take the photo of the other person in the most precarious situation.  That precarity has extended to the legal landscape, where harsher sentences are being handed down with each arrest. As much as I might agree with Neil, I do not think the search for fame sufficiently explains why people seem to want to take ever greater risks. After all, rooftoppers \u2018get up\u2019 in Dubai, Hong Kong, Moscow and New York, where the consequences of being caught are much more severe than in Toronto or Paris, for instance. If their missions were just about fame, surely the risk/reward ratio would tip the scales to places where they are less likely to end up in court or prison.           Video: James Kingston and fellow climber Mustang Wanted illegally scale the Moscow suspension bridge in Kiev, Ukraine. After some incredibly dangerous and ill-advised stunts, the pair are arrested by police on their descent    A second theory is that the escalation is coming from certain rooftoppers using the practice as a pathway into political activism \u2013 and the Hong Kong hijack and the Moscow star stunt certainly indicate this may be the case. After the China Online Centre hack, Vadim and Vitaly told Euan McKirdy at CNN that they have no philosophy, but reading a little deeper into the event does not take much effort. Only a five-minute cab ride from the skyscraper, a heaving crowd of thousands of pro-democracy protesters stood outside the Central Government Offices calling out \u201cBeijing\u201d and asserting their rights to the city.     Rooftoppers want to be free to explore their cities. The more their choices diminish, the more militant they become    There is also a third explanation, however: that exploration is inevitable. When you put people in cities where there is little available to explore on their own terms, activities like rooftopping are bound to take place \u2013 as is the escalation of those activities as people press up against the boundaries of freedom. It turns out that a good deal of attention has been paid to these kinds of behaviours by psychologists and sociologists. Psychologists have tried to quantify what they call Type T behaviour (the T stands for thrill-seeking). In the words of researchers Kari Knutson and Frank Farley, these people \u201cprefer high levels of stimulation, complexity, and are distinguished by flexibility in thinking styles\u201d. The authors go on to suggest that Type T people not only comprise 25% of the population, but that there is a higher percentage of people who are risk-seeking than risk adverse. Why, then, do we create risk adverse cities when this goes against majority desires? The foreseeable follow-up question is this: what does living in risk-adverse cities do to Type T people? Turning to sociology might provide an answer. Stephen Lyng worked with people undertaking what he called \u2018edgework\u2019 (a term coined by Hunter S Thompson); activities where individuals placed themselves in unnecessarily risky situations, close to the edge of death and chaos. Lyng goes further than Knutson and Farley to suggest that as people feel increasingly disempowered, edgework activities actually increase. Lyng\u2019s study seems to suggest that the escalation we are experiencing in rooftopping activities is as much about our environment as it is about personal needs and desires.     Rooftopping in Las Vegas. Photograph: Bradley L Garrett    Trying to separate these three motivations makes less sense than combining them. Recognition, politics and desire make for a pretty convincing motivational cocktail. The more people\u2019s conversations are eavesdropped, movements curtailed and houses raided, the more they feel a need to push back. This arms race did not begin with urban exploration. It began when our rights to the city began to be stripped back and when curiosity \u2013 a natural and necessary inclination \u2013 became criminalised. This is not armchair speculation: I have always been a Type T personality. I cave, I Scuba-dive, I skydive, I trespass, I drink too much and I work too hard \u2026 like most other T Types. In response to my explorations in the UK (part of my doctoral research), the police have raided my house twice and I have been on bail for most of the past three years under various charges. But just being charged is massively disruptive to one\u2019s life, which I think is the point. The Home Office has held my US passport almost constantly since August 2012, and I have spent much of my time living here with my possessions in police storage facilities. I have turned to publishing as a productive outlet, but I am filled with a frustration that no amount of crane-dangling will ever quell.      Looking down on the streets of London. Photograph: 'Gary'    Rooftoppers may have trouble articulating their motivations, but the message comes through loud and clear in their photography \u2013 they want to be free to make choices to explore their cities, and the more those choices diminish, the more militant their reactions become.   Related: Underground London: adventures in the secret city beneath our feet     Related: The weird afterlife of the world's subterranean 'ghost stations'    Arresting and charging people does not stop rooftopping. Changing security protocols is unlikely to either \u2013 explorers have vaulted incredibly complicated security measures, including those at the new World Trade Center in New York. The answer, it seems to me, lays in paying attention to the research and in coming to terms with the fact that a segment of every urban population needs to take risks to be content. Or, more accurately, a segment of every urban population needs to feel that they have agency, some sense of control over their lives.  While no one would recommend inexperienced climbers tackle skyscrapers, perhaps we should just let rooftoppers take the risks they want to take. If we can take off our health-and-safety blinkers for a moment, we may also realise that the photos, videos and stories produced by rooftoppers \u2013 many of them highly experienced adventurers \u2013 make the city a richer place to live.  Perhaps, too, it is time for us to all be honest with ourselves \u2013 we enjoy living vicariously through these thrill seekers. As Will Self has argued, let us reinstate the freedom to explore.

Scrap the plans and start again", "article": "By 8am, Dharavi is already noisy. Tea stalls already clinking, leather-making and embroidery and plastic-crushing machines already cranking through their long daily grind. Dharavi, the most well-known informal settlement in Mumbai, stands in a category of its own, and challenges the very notion of a slum. Its maze of matchbox buildings contains thousands of micro-industries, which collectively turn over $650m annually and provide affordable housing to the city\u2019s working class. Over decades, Dharavi\u2019s residents \u2013 its potters, garment-makers, welders and recyclers from all over India \u2013 have transformed what was a marshy outpost into a thriving entrepreneurial community. But Dharavi is no longer in the boondocks. Massive northwards growth in the peninsula city of Mumbai over the last two decades has engulfed Dharavi\u2019s humble plot of 525 acres. Today, Dharavi stands on a goldmine: a slice of land in the heart of the megapolis with the highest land prices in India. Its coveted position sits at the intersection of two main train lines, and is just a stone\u2019s throw from a new business district, the Bandra-Kurla Complex. Not surprisingly, Dharavi has caught the attention of sharkish developers. Under the government-led Dharavi Redevelopment Project, developers will provide the people living there \u2013 who can prove residency since 2000 \u2013 a new, 300 sq ft house for free. In return, authorities have allowed the builders to go higher ( increasing the floor space index in Dharavi from 1.33 to 4), thereby concentrating residents into tower blocks and freeing up space for luxury high rises that will reap huge returns. The plan has created a storm of controversy.     Turning external forces into qualities. Competition entry, The Game Is On! Illustration: Felixx Landscape Architect &amp; Planners + Studio OxL Architects    Everyone agrees that Dharavi needs better working and living conditions. The settlement may have organically achieved the low-rise, mixed-use community of many urban planners\u2019 dreams, but it is not without its problems. Years of government neglect have left Dharavi\u2019s hygiene and safety levels grossly inadequate. There are queues for everything, including toilet blocks, municipal water taps and healthcare clinics. The 300,000 or so residents \u2013 there has been no official count and studies suggest it could be double that \u2013 squeeze into an area just one-third bigger than Hyde Park.     Dharavi\u2019s design is not an accident; it responds to the social ties and economic needs of the community    The new plan to redevelop Dharavi increases that density to inhumane proportions. Although the tower-block buildings offer amenities such as toilets, they also threaten to destroy the fabric of a community in which homes, roofs and outdoor spaces transform into places of work and social interaction \u2013 the only way many of the micro-enterprises can operate. Dharavi\u2019s design is not an accident; it responds to the social ties and economic needs of the community. The clash of opinions on Dharavi\u2019s future triggered a decade-long stalemate. So, last year, Mumbai\u2019s Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI), an independent organisation advocating for more equitable development in its home city, put the problem to the global community. UDRI launched an international competition, called Reinventing Dharavi, to solicit the best ideas for this endlessly limboed issue. Twenty teams, with more than 150 members from 21 different countries, submitted proposals. The competition\u2019s only requirement was that the teams were interdisciplinary, in order to address the complex housing, work, financing, health, sanitation, recreation and legal issues.  Their proposals ranged from bathroom towers that moonlight as public spaces, to an annual festival, to a collective brand that would increase marketing power and recognition of the area\u2019s diverse products.  \u201cWe wanted to stimulate fresh thinking,\u201d said Cyrus Guzder, a member of the jury, at the competition\u2019s awards ceremony in December. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve spent some time walking around Dharavi, we must say the ideas were quite original, even from international participants.\u201d     Redevelopment of the negar (neighbourhood) in competition entry, The Game Is On! Illustration: Felixx Landscape Architect &amp; Planners + Studio OxL Architects    UDRI held a workshop to give people a first-hand look at some of the urban structures the residents themselves have already created. Many of the competition proposals built on and celebrated the community\u2019s strengths: its sense of entrepreneurship; the mixed-use developments; the low rates of crime; and strong social ties. One proposal from a Dutch team, entitled The Game is On!, honed in on the vibrancy of Dharavi\u2019s street life \u2013 the children\u2019s cricket matches, tea sellers, and fruit vendors \u2013 as the starting point for gradually improving living conditions. Their concept, which won an honourable mention, proposed to bring local stakeholders together to \u201cco-create\u201d a plan for the streets and squares that zigzag between the tightly knit neighbourhoods. \u201cThe process of street-led upgrading forms a frame for people to start upgrading their houses and workspaces, or to define places for communal buildings,\u201d says team member Joop Steenkamp, an architect. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to gradually improve living conditions without disturbing social coherence or destroying a historically grown situation.\u201d    It is hard to overstate the sea change this represents in the history of development planning for Dharavi    Many teams mapped out new physical infrastructure, such as container housing or sophisticated water systems. Another common concern was the idea of connectivity, on both a physical and economic level. The India-based members of team sevenproposed that Dharavi remain a place to both live and work, a \u201cfactory for the 21st century\u201d, and asked the judges to rethink the notion of a world-class city. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be Shanghai. We want our own characteristics, with the slum dwellers as part of that,\u201d they said. The group proposed that Dharavi no longer be an island of deprivation in the city, but rather a magnet for commerce, by converting slum buildings into industrial hubs. But it was a team from Mumbai that took first prize, for a most novel idea: scrap all plans and begin again. The group, called Plural, asked a question that has been missing in all these decades of discussion: \u201cHow would residents envision their future if they had their rights?\u201d The rights being denied to them, argued Plural, are the right to entitlement, the right to participate and the right to livelihood. And their first suggestion? To eliminate the one profiteering commodity that has skewed all visions of Dharavi\u2019s future: the land itself.      One million people live and work in Dharavi, which occupies just under one square mile. Photograph: Bethany Clarke/Getty Images    Inspired by Gandhi\u2019s notion of land as a community inheritance, the group proposed that current landowners in Dharavi \u2013 the biggest of which is the government \u2013 release all ownership rights to a Dharavi Community Land Trust.     The idea shows promise: one of the major hindrances to redevelopment has been the complexities of land ownership    This trust would be a non-profit corporation, governed by former landowners, community members and neighbourhood associations. Its first task would be to understand the needs of each of the existing 156 nagars (neighbourhoods), before developing accordingly. The idea shows promise: one of the major hindrances to redevelopment has been the complexities of land ownership, from various government agencies to private owners. The trust would solve that problem in a stroke. \u201cWe have a vision to bring back the focus on the people\u2019s needs in Dharavi in a sustainable and human-centred manner,\u201d said Jasmine Saluja, a Plural team member. \u201cWe\u2019ve had proposals on Dharavi since the 1970s, but the problem is that they\u2019ve never included the people themselves.\u201d It is hard to overstate the sea change this represents in the history of development planning for Dharavi: rewind on the process altogether. Rather than showcasing glossy images and plans, the project involves the residents in development from the get-go.  But influencing the current trajectory will be no insignificant task. There\u2019s a sobering precedent: Mumbai\u2019s abandoned mill area, which was primed for affordable housing is instead now lined with luxury malls and hotels. A similar debate is raging over how to redevelop the eastern waterfront. At some point, UDRI will need to convince not just activists but power-brokers. Its next step shows it is aware of the task ahead: UDRI is developing a publication to bring the most promising ways forward to government officials.

Welcome to instant Salem I have been obsessing over Jon Ronson\u2019s brilliant and pertinent essay in the New York Times \u2013 actually an excerpt from a forthcoming book \u2013 about the ugly phenomenon of Twitter-shaming and mob bullying. Ronson begins by discussing a fatally misjudged tweet by a PR person in New York: an offensive Aids joke to her 170 followers. This undoubtedly objectionable wisecrack went viral and called down global wrath on her head, causing her to have a breakdown whose effects lingered long after Twitter had entirely forgotten about her. It is a kind of mob justice that is not interested in the defendant\u2019s previous good character, or indeed in rehabilitation after sentence. Ronson reflects on the discrepancy between the original offence and the fanatically punitive response, with its weird recreational element. I think he is on to something, and his essay might be a turning-point. Twitter-shaming allows people who complacently think of themselves as basically nice to indulge in the dark thrill of bullying \u2013 in a righteous cause. Perhaps Ronson\u2019s article will cause a questioning of Twitter\u2019s instant-Salem culture of shame. When PG met HSBC HSBC continues to suffer an ordeal of bad publicity about its dodgy tax-avoidance wheezes and connections with Tory and Labour grandees. But there is one trump card its PR department could play. In 1900 its parent group, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, employed PG Wodehouse as junior clerk in London, amiably allowing him long lunches to watch the cricket. Wodehouse wrote in the evenings, and by 1902 he had the income and confidence to go full time as a freelance writer. Without HSBC, he might never have begun his career. As it happens, he converted his experiences at HSBC into a book, Psmith in the City, in which Mike Jackson, a likable soul not dissimilar to Wodehouse himself, takes a job in the New Asiatic Bank, where his friend Psmith is also employed. But it is run by an unsympathetic fellow called Bickersdyke, who gets elected as a Unionist MP and is a member of the Senior Conservative Club.

Kazuo Ishiguro \u2013 for all that tight authorial control he is associated with \u2013 is no different. For a long time, he tells me, as we sit in his Cotswolds cottage on a bright, wintry afternoon, he\u2019s wanted one of his novels to feature a man and his horse. Now, with the publication of his seventh, The Buried Giant, he has finally had his way. \u201cThat lone rider figure has always done it for me,\u201d he laughs. Ishiguro\u2019s prototype was the character familiar from the westerns he loves, the John Ford and Sam Peckinpah movies that so frequently, as in Ford\u2019s The Searchers, open with a distant rider crossing a vast landscape, \u201clike a self-contained little community of just a man and a horse, a lonely community that moves from place to place\u201d. What particularly resonates with Ishiguro is the idea of a man somehow adrift from history: \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense that there\u2019s a whole world travelling there in that man \u2026 he\u2019s out of time, somebody who belongs to a more violent world. And peaceful people need him when violence is needed, but he\u2019s not really welcome in a peaceful community.\u201d But it was not to the American frontier that Ishiguro looked for the backdrop for his own lone rider. Instead The Buried Giant, his first novel since 2005\u2019s Never Let Me Go, takes us back to Britain after the Romans have departed, and the Anglo-Saxons are on the brink of fully occupying the island; the moment, in other words, \u201cwhen England is created\u201d. Its horseman is none other than Sir Gawain, the youngest of King Arthur\u2019s knights, a figure of myth and legend, of chivalry and poetry; and in Ishiguro\u2019s imagining, now an old man responding \u2013 just like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Coburn in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid \u2013 to one last call to arms. \u201cDressed in rusted chainmail and mounted on a weary steed\u201d, Gawain\u2019s \u201csacred mission\u201d is to slay the she-dragon Querig. The novel inhabits the gap in the historical record, argued over by archaeologists and historians, about what happened after the Roman occupation. The hypothesis Ishiguro brings to life is that waves of Anglo-Saxon migrants from the Germanic countries landed in the eastern part of Britain, \u201cand at a certain point they massacred the people who were living here. There was what today we\u2019d call ethnic cleansing \u2013 and they just vanished. The Britons, basically, were slaughtered.\u201d In support of this theory \u2013 another view suggests that the different groups interbred and assimilated \u2013 is that so little survives, in terms of place-names or the language that we use today, of the Romano-Celtic spoken at the time. It\u2019s possible that it endures, in remnants, in Cornish or Welsh; that the survivors of the genocide fled to the westernmost parts of the country. By alighting on the moment before this brutal drama begins, Ishiguro captures a country on the brink of seismic change. As he puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s not any old conflict that\u2019s about to happen. This is the Anglo-Saxon settlement.\u201d     The cover of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Buried Giant. Photograph: Faber    It was both the uncertainty of what actually happened and the distance from contemporary events that attracted Ishiguro. His choice of setting was sparked by a reading of the 14th-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight or \u2013 more accurately \u2013 a tiny moment near the beginning when Gawain, \u201cquite a pampered guy\u201d, has to travel between castles, in a land without comfortable inns or courtly protection, constantly being chased out of villages by wolves and up hills by ogres: \u201cAnd there\u2019s a series of all the irritating things that happened in the countryside, how freezing cold it was, and rain, nowhere to shelter, and then he gets to the other castle and the story continues. And the way these things are mentioned, particularly the ogres, as if they\u2019re just like boars or something in a field, I suddenly got this vision of a landscape \u2026 I thought, that\u2019s quite a fun place to put something. And things like ogres and elves could be completely banal.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t just the prospect of \u201cfun\u201d that got Ishiguro going \u2013 and neither has writing the novel been plain sailing. He was some way in, he explains, when his wife Lorna, who is always his first reader, told him: \u201c\u2018This just will not do. I don\u2019t mean you have to change a few scenes here and there. You\u2019re going to have to start again if you want to do this. Because the language is all wrong \u2026 some of it\u2019s laughable.\u2019\u201d It was, he admits, a \u201chorrible moment\u201d, but he also points out that he started Never Let Me Go twice during the 1990s, \u201cso I don\u2019t panic\u201d. And on the bright side, the break gave him time to write the five musically themed stories in 2009\u2019s Nocturnes. He also saw the film of Never Let Me Go through production. Ishiguro is supportive of the movie adaptations of his books, another of which now looks likely, with Scott Rudin having acquired the rights to The Buried Giant. More generally, Ishiguro believes in the potential harmonies between film and cinema; he also writes screenplays, including 2005\u2019s The White Countess. Returning to The Buried Giant after completing the other projects, he made the language much plainer \u2013 less of the \u201cbehold this\u201d and \u201cpray that\u201d \u2013 and wrote it much more quickly. Ishiguro had been looking for a vehicle in which to explore a specific set of ideas about societies and historical events, but didn\u2019t want it to be easily and obviously relatable to any particular place or time. \u201cIt seemed to me wherever I put this story down, there was a danger that it would be seen as about that,\u201d he says, but he was adamant that he didn\u2019t want to look \u201cpeculiarly interested in a particular crisis in history. And so I was trying to find something that would be obviously fictional.\u201d Ogres, elves, knights and a quest-style narrative would at least partially solve the problem. \u201cA landscape like that would clearly signal that this was fantasy and you\u2019re supposed to apply it to many situations.\u201d     Illustration by Jonathan Edwards    Not that he went the whole hog. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a fantasy world where anything weird could happen. I went along with what happened in the Samurai tales I grew up on. If it\u2019s conceivable that the people of the time had these superstitions or beliefs, then I would allow it.\u201d In other words, he wouldn\u2019t have suddenly allowed a flying saucer to appear in the sky. For the reader, though, the language and the appearance of the kinds of creature more usually associated with the fantasy genre is something of a shock. Ishiguro is moderately sympathetic, although to him, of course, it makes perfect sense. \u201cI often don\u2019t appreciate the extent to which it might be a surprise,\u201d he concedes. \u201cI\u2019ve come at it from the inside. What you see at the end is my arrival point. I\u2019ve got there with what to me are fairly logical steps, but if you encounter it cold you think, \u2018God, this is odd.\u2019 This is quite a departure.\u201d Then again, he\u2019s used to it by now. \u201cI had this moment very early in my career when I went from writing Japanese books, or at least books set in Japan with Japanese characters, to writing something like The Remains of the Day. At the time, people were startled by this. They were saying, \u2018That\u2019s a bit odd, what does he know about English people? Well, I suppose he\u2019s lived here for a while.\u2019 But if you look at the reviews that came out at the time, and the comments made on review shows, this is what people talked about more than anything else \u2013 isn\u2019t it extraordinary that this young Japanese guy should know so much about English butlers, or English high society between the wars. There\u2019s a kind of surprise; perhaps people are slightly uncomfortable that I made what they see as a jump, from being someone identifiably writing about my ethnic background, if that\u2019s the word, to someone who wasn\u2019t.\u201d In fact, Ishiguro often maintains \u2013 perhaps slightly teasingly \u2013 that he writes the same book over and over again. But he also writes in the gap between two cultures \u2013 or, more precisely, between our perceptions of what those cultures might represent, or what properties they might display. He was born in Nagasaki in 1954; his mother, Shizuko, had survived the atomic bomb attack there when she was a teenager. His father, who was brought up in Shanghai, was an oceanographer, and it was his job that led the family to move to Guildford, where his mother still lives, when Kazuo was five. In a 2008 interview with the Paris Review, Ishiguro recalled how struck he was by the quietness of England, the sudden diminution in noise and images, the abiding sense of greenery. From his grandfather in Japan he still received colourful, busy books and comics; finding their English equivalents rather dull, he developed instead a great enthusiasm for Sherlock Holmes, even coming up with his own detective stories. But more than writing, his early creative impulses found expression in the song lyrics he still writes; during a gap year in 1973 between Woking grammar school and a degree in English and philosophy at Kent University, he hitchhiked around the US with a guitar over his shoulder. His musical heroes are Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell; a recent favourite film was the Coen brothers\u2019 spirited reimagining of the Greenwich Village folk scene in 1961, Inside Llewyn Davis. Although his career as a musician never took off, he believes this early experience helped to form his distinctive prose style, to which the words \u201caustere\u201d, \u201creticent\u201d and \u201cpared down\u201d are often attached. By the time he signed up for the creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia in 1978, this sensibility was already ingrained enough for course tutor Angela Carter to describe his work as \u201cvery grown-up for a young lad\u201d. Malcolm Bradbury, his other tutor, perhaps got close when he noticed the \u201cquality of irrealism\u201d and the \u201ctexture of oddity\u201d in Ishiguro\u2019s first novel, A Pale View of Hills, which was published in 1982 and won the Winifred Holtby memorial prize. The remarks came during a fascinating conversation between the two at the ICA just after publication, in which Ishiguro, who grew up speaking \u201cpidgin Japanese\u201d at home, talked about his dual\u2011culture upbringing. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to distinguish how much Japanese influence I\u2019ve actually inherited naturally, and how much I\u2019ve actually generated for myself because I felt I ought to,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think I certainly do have a tendency to create a Japaneseness about my writing when I do write books in a Japanese setting.\u201d     Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins in The Remains of the Day (1993). Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features    But his books didn\u2019t confine themselves to that background. After A Pale View of Hills and 1986\u2019s An Artist of the Floating World, which won the Whitbread book of the year award and was shortlisted for the Booker prize, Ishiguro turned to England between the wars and to Stevens, the emotionally repressed butler who some years later reflects on his unquestioning service to his former employer, the pro-German Lord Darlington. \u201cIt is sometimes said that butlers only truly exist in England,\u201d confides Stevens. \u201cOther countries, whatever title is actually used, have only manservants. I tend to believe this is true. Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the restraint which only the English race is capable of.\u201d The Remains of the Day won the Booker prize in 1989, and was later filmed by Merchant Ivory, from a script by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (Harold Pinter had worked on an earlier version), with Anthony Hopkins taking the role of Stevens. Both commercial and critical success meant continuing freedom to experiment, and in 1995 Ishiguro published The Unconsoled, which could hardly have been more different. At 500-odd pages, it was set in an unnamed city in central Europe, and narrated by a concert pianist whose every effort to fulfil his obligations is thwarted by a series of bizarre obstacles. Its aesthetic was informed above all by the logic of dreams. Critic James Wood said \u2013 a much quoted comment \u2013 that it \u201cinvented its own category of badness\u201d; Anita Brookner described it as \u201calmost certainly a masterpiece\u201d. His next novel, When We Were Orphans, also had a dreamlike quality. Focusing again on the interwar period, it was the story of Christopher Banks, a famous society detective whose life has never really risen clear of the early trauma of his parents\u2019 disappearance in Shanghai, and who believes that he can still crack the case \u2013 which, it gradually becomes apparent, operates as some kind of mental stand-in for the approaching global conflict. It is a deeply mysterious, upsetting novel, and also confirms Ishiguro as a master of psychogeography; his landscapes, whether they are bits of half-remembered English countryside or cities in the midst or aftermath of conflict, are suffused with mental imagery that potently blurs the distinctions between what characters \u2013 or readers \u2013 see and what they imagine, between what might have been and what will perhaps come to pass. The nightmarish final section of When We Were Orphans sees Banks struggling through chaotic, contested back alleys during the battle of Shanghai, far from the safety of the international settlement, searching for his long-vanished parents. Sustained over the course of 50 utterly gripping pages, it is studded with abandoned buildings, impassable tunnels and dispossessed people of uncertain identity, and with sudden changes of scene: \u201cI would often stumble into a barely damaged chest of drawers or shrine, giving the impression the family had just gone out for the day. But then right next to such places I would discover more rooms utterly destroyed or flooded \u2026 Once I came upon three dogs savagely tearing something apart, and drew my pistol, so convinced was I they would come for me; but even these animals meekly watched me pass, as though they had come to respect the carnage a man was capable of wreaking.\u201d When We Were Orphans was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize, as was his next novel, Never Let Me Go (2005), which lost to John Banville\u2019s The Sea in an exceptionally strong shortlist that also included Ali Smith\u2019s The Accidental, Zadie Smith\u2019s On Beauty, A Long Long Way by Sebastian Barry and Arthur and George by Julian Barnes. The dystopian, science-fiction element of the story \u2013 cloned children are bred for organ donation and must nurse one another through their \u201cdonations\u201d until, at a horribly early age, they \u201ccomplete\u201d, or die \u2013 meant that for a long time, Ishiguro would be invited to comment on TV and in newspapers every time there was a \u201cweird science\u201d story. It too was made into a film, with a screenplay by Ishiguro\u2019s friend, the novelist turned film-maker Alex Garland.     Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in Never Let Me Go (2010). Photograph: FoxSearch/Everett Collection/Rex Features    Of course, the book is not really about cloning, but about mortality, which Ishiguro believes links it to his new novel: \u201cThat sense of what happens to love between people when the proximity of death is felt is something that both books have in common. And that is quite an emotional subject. It would be odd if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d (Nonetheless, he adds, he doesn\u2019t like to have extraneous emotion in his novels. \u201cIt has to be about the big thing. I tend to avoid incidentally sad scenes. I don\u2019t like orphans and dogs dying in my books.\u201d) As The Buried Giant opens, we are introduced to an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice, who, impelled by some vague sense of unease, decide to leave their small, warren-like community and go in search of their son. Their journey is made more precarious both by the numerous dangers that might assail them, including the dark forces of the \u201cGreat Plain\u201d, and by their own tenuous grasp on reality: for snaking in and out of the narrative is a nebulous mist that has rendered the population strangely forgetful, aware that certain episodes in their past have taken place, but mystifyingly unable to access them. It is this mist that is The Buried Giant\u2019s ideological centre, the nub of what Ishiguro wanted to explore. He had previously concentrated on how individuals struggle with painful memories, caught between a desire to confront them and a fear of what might be unearthed; sometimes past trauma is so deeply embedded, as in A Pale View of Hills and When We Were Orphans, that it warps perspective, giving rise to fractured narratives in which both the protagonist\u2019s and reader\u2019s sense of what is real is brought into question. Now, though, he wanted to explore how that might work at a societal level. And while his incidental reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight provided him with the setting, his interest in the theme went back much further. He recalls being asked, over a decade ago, to chair a panel at the World Economic Forum and settled on a topic that was preoccupying him greatly: how societies remember and forget, when and how we decide it is time to move on from the past, and what implications this has for the pursuit of justice. His panel members included Holocaust survivor and political activist Elie Wiesel and a then deputy mayor of New York, Dan Doctoroff, at the time engaged in working out how the city should commemorate 9/11.    If I had been a generation older, what would I have done? Would I have also been a fascist?    For himself, says Ishiguro, referring to The Remains of the Day and An Artist of the Floating World, \u201cI\u2019d always been slightly uneasy about the idea that you could make an individual like Stevens the butler, or a Japanese artist of a certain period, representative of the whole of English society between the wars, or Japanese society after the second world war.\u201d Those characters were pictured looking back at lives devoted to what turn out to be dangerous principles \u2013 in both cases, fascism. They were explorations of \u201cwhat happens if you do your very best, but because you don\u2019t have an extraordinary perception of the world, and you can\u2019t help but be a part of the society you live in, you invest all your talents in something that later you think you shouldn\u2019t have\u201d. They are elegies for lives not merely wasted but fundamentally misguided. This was the key territory of Ishiguro\u2019s first three books, and he says it was \u201cvery, very clear\u201d to him as an area he was determined to explore: \u201cBecause I was a young guy at the time, I was aware of my parents\u2019 generation, and the generation in Germany, who because they\u2019d lived when they did, they had been caught up in that sort of fervour. I felt if I had been a generation older, what would I have done? Would I have also been a fascist?\u201d It also chimed with his own experiences as a young man, when he was working for the housing charity Cyrenians, where he met his wife; the couple married in 1986 and have a daughter, Naomi, who is in her early 20s. Back in the 1980s, Ishiguro found himself a frequent participant in political debates on key issues of the day, such as the campaign for unilateral nuclear disarmament. As time went on, he says, he began to ask himself: \u201cHow sure are we that we\u2019re backing the right cause? We\u2019re well-meaning, but most of us are just being swept along. We\u2019re not sitting down and really examining why we\u2019re taking certain stances. We belong to certain tribes, and there\u2019s always the correct slogan and position on every issue for our little tribe.\u201d Having explored the intersection between politics and personal belief, Ishiguro wanted to move on to examine how communities, societies and nations deal with memories, and whether it is crucially different from the ways that individuals do. He wanted to know who controls a society\u2019s memories, who mobilises them and to what ends; whether they can be used, as he believes Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 did in the former Yugoslavia, to awaken dormant ill-feeling between people.     Ishiguro in London in January. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    \u201cWhat are the main mechanisms by which a country like Britain or France or Japan remembers? Is it by means of the literature, is it by means of museums, is it official history books? What is it? It\u2019s some mixture of all those things, but in the end it comes down to what ordinary people actually have in their heads about what happened in their country,\u201d he argues. Along with the rest of the world, he had watched as Yugoslavia disintegrated, and as genocide claimed at least 800,000 lives in Rwanda; as well as the obvious horror, he experienced \u201ca profound disappointment, because after the Berlin Wall came down, and we were supposed to be at the end of history, we had this idea that things were going to become peaceful\u201d. Then, suddenly, \u201cyou had concentration camps, death camps, massacres like Srebrenica, right in the middle of Europe. And the astonishing thing then \u2013 and I suppose looking back it shouldn\u2019t have been so astonishing \u2013 was the fact that people, neighbours who\u2019d been living with each other for decades, just turned on each other and massacred each other. It is well known that in those villages, certain houses were marked with crosses the night before, so that the militia could go through and just kill the people in those houses. And these were people who\u2019d been eating in each other\u2019s houses, and looking after each other\u2019s children.\u201d He is interested, too, in how countries such as Rwanda and South Africa are able to move on from such widespread violence and trauma. \u201cTo some extent,\u201d he notes, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to abandon justice and grievance to break the cycle of violence.\u201d But also feeding into Ishiguro\u2019s thought processes were examples of a collective reaction to trauma from further back. Japan in the immediate aftermath of the second world war gave him the setting for his first two novels; he has clearly been long preoccupied by what he calls the country\u2019s \u201creally strange version\u201d of what happened during the conflict: \u201cJapan as a nation wiped out the fact that they were aggressors in the second world war and that they rampaged through a lot of China and east Asia slaughtering people. Most people in Japan remember the second world war as a great tragedy which climaxed with two atomic bombs.\u201d He adds that they were encouraged in this view by the American authorities, who needed Japan to be a sturdy ally against communist Russia and China; but that the consequences of that version of events having taken such firm hold creates problems between Japan and China to this day.

Photograph: Allstar/Merchant Ivory/Sportsphoto    Vichy France, too, is an area of fascination, not merely because of its own interpretation of its wartime history \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019ve all convinced themselves that they were resistance fighters rather than that it was a country that sent its own Jews to Auschwitz, and the Vichy regime was happily collaborating, and in every small village there were people who betrayed other people to the Gestapo\u201d \u2013 but because of the way that interpretation shaped popular culture. To say that Ishiguro and his wife are film fans is something of an understatement; they have a home cinema in their north London house and organise their own mini-seasons (recent examples are screwball comedies and war films, which they\u2019ve temporarily shelved after the distress of watching Elem Klimov\u2019s drama about the Nazi occupation of Belarus, Come and See). They also, clearly, think very deeply about them; and one of their theories about French postwar popular culture \u2013 both the Nouvelle Vague in film and the nouveau roman in literature \u2013 is that \u201cthere was a real desire to put an end to the kind of realist narrative fiction tradition, because nobody wanted a Balzac to write about what the hell happened. That\u2019s the last thing you want.\u201d In movies, the argument continues, film-making became ever more personal, more inward \u2013 \u201ca way of creating what seems to be serious art without tackling this huge thing that\u2019s staring you in the face. What the hell happened to us? How did we face up to the challenges of Nazi occupation?\u201d Meanwhile, the films that were actually addressing the legacy of war-time France were the genre films, the gangster stories of honourable thieves and corrupt policemen and politicians. Alain Delon is keeping a watchful eye as Ishiguro is telling me all this \u2013 a large portrait of the French film actor, specially commissioned after the couple saw a vast picture of Claudia Cardinale by the same artist, occupies one wall, with another on the wall opposite. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite figured out how to use this place yet,\u201d he says of the cottage they acquired a couple of years ago. It sits in a quiet corner of a village in the north Cotswolds which, he assures me, is a world away from Chipping Norton, associated with the likes of Jeremy Clarkson and Rebekah Brooks. \u201cWe still think of it rather like a holiday place. I come with a lot of good intentions, with lots of books and stuff to do, and I never do it. We spend all our time wandering about local cafes. I\u2019m a bit bad about tea and cake.\u201d    I\u2019ve managed to stay relatively pure. I stick to what I really want to write about.    Does he just have a sweet tooth, I wonder, or is there something about the ritual of afternoon tea that he likes? The question is prompted by the meticulously described upper-class ceremonials in The Remains of the Day, the constant tea-making of A Pale View of Hills, the grand 1930s hotels in When We Were Orphans. A bit of both, he thinks. \u201cI\u2019ve never really liked sitting in pubs in the evening drinking ale, but I do like sitting around chatting with tea and scones. But you\u2019ve got to have the right setting.\u201d When I drove into the village that morning, I tell him, I saw lots of togged-up ramblers, setting off with walking poles and charts. Is he likely to do that? He gestures, half-hopefully, half the opposite, towards a shelf holding books of walks and Ordnance Survey maps. \u201cI think Lorna thought we would go for bracing walks and things, but we haven\u2019t done that very much. We\u2019ve just sat eating coffee-and-walnut cake.\u201d That is, of course, not \u201cjust\u201d what he does. Most of the time, he is writing. But, I point out, he is conspicuous by his absence from public debate, from the writer-as-commentator position occupied by novelists such as Ian McEwan or Martin Amis or, in her essays, by Hilary Mantel. \u201cI did it once, right at the beginning of my career,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt was the anniversary of one of the atomic bombs, and the Guardian asked me to write a piece about the atomic bomb\u2019s relationship to literature. This was back in 1983 or something, when the cold war was still on, and people were much more preoccupied about nuclear weapons.\u201d He thought he should do it; his first novel hadn\u2019t even come out in paperback and he\u2019d probably get a whole page in the paper. \u201cI sat down and I thought, well, I don\u2019t really feel strongly about anything, but I\u2019d better work myself up into some position, and write a piece as though I do feel very strongly about something to do with it. I came up with this concept of the pornography of seriousness, that some people would often bring in issues like the Holocaust or the atomic bombs into otherwise fairly ordinary stories, so that the stories would be given a serious dimension.\u201d It sounds pretty plausible and, indeed, he thinks it was pretty well written. \u201cBut this was something I hadn\u2019t been going around fuming about, or even thinking about until I got asked.\u201d He laughs. \u201cBut if you read that piece now, you\u2019d think I had; a guy who was born in Nagasaki who felt the whole nuclear thing had been exploited by people just trying to lend spurious weight and seriousness to their otherwise rather banal piece of fiction.\u201d After that experience \u2013 quite the reverse of what happened when he wrote fiction \u2013 he realised that \u201cif I keep doing this, I won\u2019t know who the hell I am. I\u2019ll just be a sum total of these positions that I\u2019ve taken up to fulfil commissions.\u201d Instead, he decided that he\u2019d be better off spending the time working out what really interests him \u2013 and has spent the following 30 years doing precisely that. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to stay relatively pure. I stick to what I really want to write about,\u201d he says, although he thinks others should feel free to air their views and be given a platform to do so. For him, though, \u201cthat\u2019s not my job. I write novels. I try and write films. I write songs. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d The Buried Giant is published by Faber on 3 March", "tags": ["Kazuo Ishiguro", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2015-02-19T16:42:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/19/russian-bombers-raf-flight-west-putin-cold-war-nato", "sentences": ["Western domination of global political and economic forums such as the UN security council and the G7 have led him to alternative international structures such as the Eurasian Economic Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation."], "title": "Russian bombers testing the RAF hark back to cold war for Putin and the west", "article": "The sight of Russian long-range nuclear bombers testing the RAF in the skies off Cornwall has brought home the perils faced daily by the inhabitants of eastern Ukraine and reignited inflammatory talk of a new cold war with Russia.  Against a background of overt and tacit threats to former satellite states, tit-for-tat spy expulsions, high-risk military games of chicken, gas supply cut-offs, and angry diplomatic exchanges, it seems the west is rapidly rewinding to the bad old days of confrontation with Soviet Russia.   And as the Ukraine ceasefire appears to unravel, the question on the lips of every western leader, army general, business analyst and spy chief is: what does Vladimir Putin want?  The Russian president\u2019s apparent bad faith in honouring the Minsk peace accord is seen as part of a pattern of threatening behaviour that has raised tensions across Europe. Russia\u2019s armed forces, both nuclear and conventional, are formidable, and have global reach.  Despite the falling oil price, sharp devaluation of the rouble and western economic sanctions, Putin continues, undeterred, to spend heavily on Russia\u2019s military and its nuclear weapons arsenal. The country\u2019s 2014 military budget was about $70bn, with only the US and China spending more. It is set to rise this year to $84bn.   Related: After separatists' victory in Debaltseve, will Putin stick or twist?     Russia\u2019s navy comprises the Northern Fleet, based at Murmansk, the Baltic Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, Caspian Flotilla, and Pacific Fleet, while the army, partly based on conscription, is believed to number about 300,000 men \u2013 Britain\u2019s army totals about 86,000.  American estimates suggest Russia has approximately 1,500 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, plus more than 1,000 in reserve. It can also deploy 2,000 tactical nuclear warheads. Missile system platforms included land-based silos, submarines, and air-launched warheads. Of particular alarm to analysts is Russia\u2019s development of new nuclear-armed cruise missiles and long-range submarines as 1980s arms control treaties expire. So-called close encounters with Russia\u2019s conventional military have grown exponentially in the past year, from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean. Russia\u2019s air force, of particular concern to Britain, comprises 38 advanced fighter squadrons, including MiG29s, 15 Su-24 bomber squadrons and 14 assault squadrons, plus other assets.  David Cameron, criticised for his silence over Russia\u2019s actions, is now showing increased urgency. He waded in on Wednesday after it became clear the Moscow-armed separatists had Ukraine\u2019s army on the run. \u201cWe must not allow people to cause instability and bully their neighbours,\u201d he said. Defence secretary Michael Fallon went further. He warned that the Baltic republics \u2013 Nato members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2013 could be next. \u201cNato has to be ready for any kind of aggression from Russia, whatever form it takes. Nato is getting ready,\u201d Fallon said. This all seems slightly hysterical. Looked at from Putin\u2019s perspective, Russia is more attacked than aggressor. His narrative of national victimhood begins in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent \u201ctragic\u201d implosion of the Soviet Union.   Related: Ukrainian soldiers share horrors of Debaltseve battle after stinging defeat     Argument still rages over whether the then US secretary of state James Baker promised President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that Nato would not enlarge up to Russia\u2019s borders. Whatever people say now, Putin insists the promise was made \u2013 and cynically broken. In Putin\u2019s mind, Nato\u2019s expansion is matched by EU enlargement into central and eastern Europe, which he views as little more than another American-inspired attempt to deny Russia its traditional spheres of influence in its \u201cnear abroad\u201d.  Putin\u2019s grievances, real and imagined, include overbearing US militarism in the Middle East, notably in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan, and in its crude attempts to dictate the future of Syria and Iran.  Western domination of global political and economic forums such as the UN security council and the G7 have led him to alternative international structures such as the Eurasian Economic Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.  Putin is actively building bilateral ties with China, including big oil and gas export deals, as a way of off-setting US influence and reducing Russia\u2019s dependency on European energy markets.  Yet Putin is not merely reactive and pragmatic. He is, equally, an opportunist and an ideologue \u2013 a passionate, patriotic Russian nationalist, fiercely proud of the Motherland (the beloved Rodina) and determined to restore lost greatness. It is this sense of mission that makes him truly dangerous and unpredictable.           People living in war-torn eastern Ukraine struggle to feed themselves and their children as provisions become increasingly scarce.     But it is Putin\u2019s belief in western, especially American weakness \u2013 even moral decadence \u2013 that is perhaps most threatening of all.  Peering out from his Kremlin perch, Putin sees a European continent divided between wealthy and poor countries, between north and south, and senses an opportunity. He sees a Nato alliance similarly riven yet, like the EU, united in its wish to avoid an open fight with Russia.  He sees a risk-averse US president who, his many domestic critics say, has abandoned America\u2019s global leadership role. He sees, in the end of the American unipolar moment, a chance to forge a Bush-ian new world order conformable to his authoritarian, paternalistic philosophy.  Putin sees himself, above all, as a muscular champion and guardian of traditional, patriotic and national values and of familial, religious and sexual orthodoxy. The legacy he draws on is neither Soviet nor Marxist-Leninist, but imperial. What Putin wants is power and pre-eminence, personal and national.

Arranged around the room are samples of odd-looking concrete wall of varying thickness. Outside, across the car park of this otherwise unremarkable industrial estate, is a grand, neoclassical mansion that recently became a global internet sensation . It is the world\u2019s first 3D-printed villa. Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing \u2013 the process of fabricating solid objects from digital models \u2013 has been around for three decades. Talk of how this technology could transform both the construction industry and the way we conceive of and build cities has long circulated, too. With 3D printing, customisable \u201cdream\u201d homes would no longer be the purview of the rich, and architects would be able to create fantastically complex geometrical structures. In the developing world, low-income housing could be erected en masse, while speedily printed structures would provide disaster relief or temporary homes for refugees. But until recently such talk was largely theoretical. Then in March 2014, the little-known Chinese company Winsun announced it had 3D-printed 10 \u00a33,200 concrete houses in a day. When, in January of this year, it unveiled that 3D-printed 1,100-square-metre villa \u2013 and a five-storey apartment building \u2013 it raised the question of whether the technology was about to become commercially viable. In Winsun\u2019s showroom, a video on a giant LED screen shows a printer head moving horizontally along a massive gantry frame. Winsun\u2019s 3D printer is 6.6 metres tall, 10m wide and 150m long, I\u2019m told. I am not permitted to see it. A filmed close-up of the nozzle reveals what looks like a giant icing bag extruding a grainy batter in a careful pattern. This \u201cink\u201d is made from recycled rubble, fibreglass, steel, cement and binder, and takes 24 hours to dry. The ribbed-finish printed walls are hollow inside apart from a corrugated filler, a design that saves on materials without sacrificing strength. It took eight people one month to finish the \u00a3105,000 villa, explains Zheng Jian, general manager of Winsun\u2019s Suzhou operations. If traditional construction methods were used it would take 30 people three months. Costs are halved.     The 3D-printed villa by WinSun, on display in Suzhou industrial park. Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis    \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to set up factories all over the world,\u201d says Ma Yihe, Winsun\u2019s CEO, a couple of days later in the company\u2019s Shanghai office. Winsun Global, a joint venture with an American financial firm who\u2019s identity Ma will not reveal (\u201cthey have great influence in the Middle East\u201d), aims to establish 3D printer plants in 20 countries in the next few years, including Dubai, Britain and France. In China Winsun will build as many as 100 factories. The Egyptian government, meanwhile, has already signed a deal for 20,000 single-storey dwellings in the desert. Winsun will provide the printer and formula for making \u201cink\u201d from sand, and the houses will be printed on site. \u201cThe future of Winsun is as a technology company,\u201d Ma says. \u201cWe\u2019re turning from a company focused on producing and selling construction materials to a company exporting technology \u2026 These houses you see are made by our first-generation printer. We\u2019re now developing generation six.\u201d     Ten houses built in 24 hours with 3D printing technology in 2014. Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis    Perhaps unsurprisingly, the plans are not without controversy. When Behrokh Khoshnevis, a pioneer of 3D printing at the University of Southern California, learned of Winsun\u2019s creation of 10 houses in 24 hours, he was shocked. \u201cI\u2019m very upset with this man,\u201d Khoshnevis says on the telephone from his office in Los Angeles, referring to Ma.  According to Khoshnevis, in 2013 Ma visited him at USC to view the professor\u2019s work. Later, Khoshnevis was invited to visit Ma\u2019s company in China: \u201cI went there and [Ma] asked me to show him the consistency of this material, and I showed him all of that. Then he didn\u2019t contact me.\u201d  Khoshnevis says he has spent two decades refining and patenting a 3D-printing technology called Contour Crafting. He claims Winsun\u2019s operations, which are similar, copy his idea: \u201c[Ma] has infringed on my method of corrugated wall structures, claiming he was the guy who has worked on this for many years,\u201d Khoshnevis says. Winsun did not respond to a request for comment on the claims. Khoshnevis, who is also working with Nasa on 3D-printed lunar structures, has no doubt that in the future, a large portion of cities will be printed. \u201cI think in about five years you are going to see a lot of buildings built in this way,\u201d he says.    At the dawn of the 21st century about two billion people live in slums. I think this technology is a good solution.  Behrokh Khoshnevis     He hopes the technology will help address a worldwide shortage of low-income housing. \u201cI think it is a shame that at the dawn of the 21st century, about two billion people live in slums,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this technology is a good solution.\u201d  He adds that 3D printing will encourage governments to build affordable homes because of savings in time and cost. A significant difference between traditional construction methods and 3D printing is efficiency. If in the future a London borough wished to build a public housing estate, for instance, they could hire a developer with a 3D printer. The printer would then be delivered to the site along with the construction material and architectural design on a flash drive. \u201cThey plug it in, hit a button and the buildings get built,\u201d Khoshnevis says. \u201cThe nice thing about it is that we can build beautiful, dignified neighbourhoods \u2013 not cookie-cutter, box-like houses.\u201d  Not all architects are convinced that 3D printing is good for architecture as a discipline. Writing in the New Statesman in 2013, Amanda Levete, principal at AL_A, long ago warned against the \u201ccreep of an unchecked evangelism around the advent of 3D printing ... It may come without economic cost at a small scale but in architecture, if we are not careful, this is at the expense of integrity.\u201d But according to Adam Kushner, president of D-Shape Enterprises, 3D printing will liberate architecture. To underline the point, Kushner partnered with Italian inventor and engineer Enrico Dini to create a self-financed, 2,400-sq-ft, 3D-printed estate \u2013 with swimming pool \u2013 in Gardiner, New York.      Adam Kushner\u2019s designs for a 3D-printed estate.  Illustration: Kushner Studios/Harlan Steed/Karl Jeune    Dini\u2019s massive D-Shape printer uses sand and a magnesium-based binder to create stone-like structures; it could be used in the restoration of crumbling temples, or to build anything from bridges to public loos. Kushner\u2019s vision is more elaborate and personal: the rounded form of his roof design for the estate mimics the surrounding tree canopy, while the walls resemble local rock formations. Built the traditional way, the estate would cost around $500,000. Kushner aims to spend half of that. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to make is a work of architecture,\u201d Kushner says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to speak to a greater series of questions and problems. I can\u2019t answer those questions in any methodology other than 3D printing.\u201d The concave-convex surfaces of Kushner\u2019s design, for instance, would otherwise require the prefabrication of formworks (moulds), the mounting of complicated scaffolding, and manual casting \u2013 which are all expensive and slow. \u201cI think [3D printing] is as fundamental a shift as the elevator was in raising our cities,\u201d Kushner says. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the act of construction being this difficult, time-consuming, energy-consuming part of our lives. We can build these amazing, beautiful structures and then let\u2019s do other things \u2013 let\u2019s go out there and enjoy the world around us.\u201d Additional reporting by Alex Sun", "tags": ["Cities", "China", "Architecture", "Construction industry", "3D printing", "Technology", "Housing", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-02-26T09:58:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/26/duke-of-cambridge-to-work-with-east-anglian-air-ambulance", "sentences": ["In China, William is to visit Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City and he will launch the three-day great festival of creativity in Shanghai."], "title": "Duke of Cambridge to work with East Anglian air ambulance", "article": "The Duke of Cambridge is to start work with the East Anglian air ambulance (EAAA) this summer after finishing and passing air transport pilot licence exams.

The job based at Cambridge airport is convenient for the Cambridges\u2019 new country home, Anmer Hall, a Grade II-listed 10-bedroom mansion on the Queen\u2019s Sandringham estate, recently privately refurbished to accommodate the duke and duchess and Prince George. While in London, the couple will live at their 21-room apartment at Kensington Palace, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a34.5m to the public purse. The EAAA operates two helicopters and employs three pilots in Norwich and three in Cambridge, covering Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. Along with a pilot, each helicopter carries a doctor and a paramedic. William\u2019s main duties will involve flying an EC145 T2 aircraft, working alongside medics to respond to emergencies ranging from road accidents to heart attacks. The announcement came as William arrived in Japan for a four-day visit that will see him meet survivors of the 2011 tsunami. He started his first visit to Japan with the tea ceremony at Hama Rikyu Gardens in Tokyo. His wife Kate, who is due to give birth to their second child in April, stayed home. The Edo-era style garden, which once belonged to a feudal shogun, is filled with sculpted pine trees and blossoming plum trees, and features wooden bridges over several lakes.  The Japan leg will include a visit to a school in the north-eastern region of Fukushima, where some areas have been closed off around a nuclear power plant that went into meltdown four years ago. William will also visit other areas devastated by the March 2011 tsunami to show support for the survivors and pay his respects to those who died. The tsunami and the quake that set it off killed about 19,000 people, and displaced tens of thousands, including those whose homes were intact but contaminated by the radiation spewed from the Fukushima plant. He will be taken to the area devastated by the waters, but some have claimed he will not meet families whose lives were blighted when the tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Local leaders have accused Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who wants to restart the country\u2019s nuclear plants, of using the royal visit for his own aims. According to local reports Abe will join William on his visit to a public playground where contaminated soil has been removed \u2013 but it is believed he will not meet families driven from their homes by the nuclear disaster.

Hunt has told the Guardian that in government he plans to set up a special fund, administered independently, to advise teachers on what they can do to stretch the most talented children in primary and secondary schools. He said: \u201cWe have done a lot to help those at risk of falling behind through initiatives such as the Pupil Premium, but we need to more to help the most talented, especially from deprived backgrounds.\u201d Labour, under the influence of Lord Adonis and David Miliband in 2002, set up a National Academy for Gifted and Talented youth, but after some chopping and changing the funding was withdrawn in 2010 and it has not been revived by the coalition government. Hunt is proposing that schools be entitled to bid for monies from the Gifted and Talented Fund to help their work in stretching their most able pupils. It is likely to have a \u00a315m pot initially, and will set up a new evidence base on how to encourage talented children. International research shows that, with most resources focused on improving the performance of the lowest achievers, the UK performs badly in helping the most talented children.   Hunt said: \u201cSchools should use all the tools at their disposal, including streaming in English and maths where that is necessary. There is nothing wrong in recognising that people are born with different skills and talents. We need to develop all talents, but it is right to recognise that some talents can be stretched further.\u201d His plan comes as the government prepares this week to give to go-ahead to a new annexe to a grammar school in Sevenoaks in Kent, in effect a new grammar school. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, welcomed Hunt\u2019s plan, saying: \u201cOur research shows that England compares poorly with other countries in its provision for the highly able. Weak school support for able students contributes to a big university access gap, where those from the richest fifth of neighbourhoods are more than nine times more likely to go to our best universities than those from the poorest fifth of neighbourhoods. Put simply, too many bright young people from low- and middle-income families are being let down.\u201d Hunt said: \u201cEnglish education\u2019s lacklustre support for gifted state school pupils is an underappreciated a component of inequity. The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission report in 2014 showed that this failure is particularly acute when it comes to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some 8,000 kids on free school meals achieve the top grades at primary school every year, and yet only 900 make it through to the elite universities.  \u201cEvery child has the right to learn something new and exciting every day. We on the left need to shelve any misplaced scruples about stretching the most able, trust in teachers, and support plans for a new Gifted and Talented fund.\u201d   Research shows that the OECD average for pupils reaching the highest levels of performance at age 15 in maths is 3.1%, whereas in the England it is just 1.7%, with the majority coming from independent or grammar schools. This leaves the UK ranked 26th out of 34 OECD areas, behind Shanghai (27%), Singapore (16%), Switzerland (8%) and Belgium (6%). In literacy, England performs around the average, but again the top-performing pupils are overwhelmingly drawn from independent and grammar schools. An Ofsted report in 2013 criticised the non-selective state school for a \u201cmediocre\u201d and \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d record at assisting highly able, non-privileged children to fulfil their potential.

What flows from us handing power to you follows an old principle: the less the powerful are challenged, the more muscles they think they can flex. In short, you and your coterie do what you want. Here are three examples. State school parents of year 1 children in England may not know that waiting for their offspring in 2016 is a spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag) exam that is already affecting their children, as it forces teachers to do what inspectors and ministers pretend to despise, ie to teach to the test. Yet the exam was brought in on the basis of no evidence and no public discussion. Luckily for you and your predecessor\u2019s coterie, the media didn\u2019t question how such a huge change could have taken place. They would have discovered that it came in as a late tagged-on recommendation to the secretary of state from a committee that was established to produce a report on \u201cassessment and accountability\u201d, and not from a committee formed to discuss the best way to teach English.    What crazy command structure are we locked into that something this important should be decided by one junior minister?    This Spag test was recommended with hardly a footnote of evidence and on a false premise \u2013 namely that spelling, punctuation and grammar questions have right and wrong answers. Nor did it consider the possibility that questions for seven-year-olds that produce only right and wrong answers might be the wrong questions to be asking them about language anyway. Every day, in signs, advertising, posters, leaflets and poems, children are presented with hundreds of examples of writing that do not follow the rules required by the Spag test. If your little coterie were serious about children learning about language, you would have encouraged the kind of teaching that would enable children and teachers to investigate usage and change: for example, why might they read on signs near me that the Edwardian Queen\u2019s Mansions are in Queens\u2019 Avenue? However, such work might raise the spectre that not only are adults inconsistent, but also that, when government committees exercise power over children through exams, they don\u2019t tell the truth about right and wrong. Second, your colleague Nick Gibb\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A session with publishers last November gave some people the impression that Gibb was advocating, first, that capitalist publishers of textbooks should sometimes produce materials that the consumers (schools) don\u2019t want and, second, that, if they don\u2019t produce them, textbooks from Singapore will be brought into schools anyway. According to Merlin John, a freelance journalist formerly with the Times Educational Supplement, Gibb said: \u201cYou have got to do it, I\u2019m afraid, because otherwise we\u2019ll have to use Singapore maths books, which is not what we want.\u201d This is a minister who will unhappily confess what he perceives to be the defects in his own education, making a decision about what should be taught and how. If he thinks that England has something to learn from Singaporean and Shanghai maths textbooks, why doesn\u2019t he set up a commission of maths teachers, mathematicians and textbook publishers to investigate the\u00a0matter? What crazy command structure have we got locked into that something this important, affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of students and the working practices of thousands of teachers, should be decided by one junior minister? Third, in a recent speech at the British Educational and Training Show, you first boasted about the academies programme your coterie has imposed on the English education system \u2013 a programme that has cost millions but cannot show that, of itself, it improves\u00a0schools. Then, you waxed lyrical about new digital ways to monitor and track children and students, through the use of \u201cregular, standardised tests\u201d. You used the fact that we parents like to know what our children are up to, to justify a system that enables parents to \u201ctrack day-to-day progress\u201d, as if our queries and concerns could be satisfied with yet more test scores. \u201cUse technology to improve the flow of information,\u201d you said, even as teachers, pupils and parents drown under the weight of the weekly testing that many of our secondary-age children are put through. Has anyone in your castle put a stopwatch on the hours that 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds are spending preparing for and sitting in-school tests? Isn\u2019t a pointless set of high-stakes exams at 16 enough for you people? But tests are good for control from the top. Even as you pretend that \u201cmonitoring\u201d is \u201caccountability\u201d, it locks students and teachers into inflexible, hour-by-hour containment. In its own way, it\u2019s perfect.

Speaking at the Xishuangbanna Elephant Sanctuary in Yunnan Province, Prince William said: \u201cit is appalling that elephants - and many others - may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes\u201d.  The extinction of elephants and other animals such as rhinos and pangolins would be \u201can immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity,\u201d he said.  The prince said the illegal trade in wildlife, just like pollution and climate change, \u201crecognise[d] no borders\u201d. He said it is a \u201ccommon enemy\u201d that \u201cerodes the rule of law, fuels conflict, and may even fund terrorism\u201d.  The prince has been campaigning to save endangered animals for several years and in December he mentioned in a speech how in China the wholesale price of ivory had increased from $5 (\u00a33) to $2,100 per kilogram in 25 years and poaching has increased as a result. Today he praised China for its \u201ccontribution to the protection of wildlife in Africa\u201d but he said that there is much more to be done including reducing the demand for products made from endangered animals. \u201cDemand provides traffickers with their incentive. It fuels their greed, and generates their vast profits,\u201d he said.  China has come under fire from conservationists who say that its huge appetite for ivory has fuelled poaching to a level that it threatens the existence of elephants in parts of Africa. Ivory has become a popular luxury item among China\u2019s wealthy. Praising the one-year ban on the import of ivory carvings implemented last week in China, the prince said such steps are \u201cwelcome\u201d and would help to ensure that the legal trade could not be used as a front to launder illegal ivory products. China\u2019s State Administration of Forestry declared the ban last Thursday with immediate effect in a public notice posted on its official site, in which it said the administration would not handle any import request.  William said he had discussed the efforts China is making during his meeting with president Xi Jinping on Monday, who told him of China\u2019s \u201cintention to do more\u201d.      Prince William, Duke of Cambridge visits an Elephant Walkway on March 4, 2015 in Xishuangbanna, China. Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images    The prince met with conservationists during his visit to the sanctuary and fed a rescued elephant named Ran Ran. He also met with the local Dai community who live side by side with wild elephants.  In a reference to China\u2019s challenge to balance GDP growth with environmental protection the prince said that all countries \u201cexperience the tension between the need to develop resources for the good of all, and the responsibility to preserve nature\u201d and that this is a \u201cdifficult balance\u201d. The two cannot be separated, he added, and long-term economic stability requires \u201csustainable development green growth\u201d. The prince features on a billboard campaign in China along with David Beckham and Chinese celebrities such as former basketball player Yao Ming and actress Li Bingbing that aims reduce demand for ivory. During the Prince\u2019s visit, he also featured on a television campaign being aired across the country and on the world\u2019s largest video screen on the facade of the Citi Tower on the waterfront of Shanghai\u2019s iconic Bund. WildAid, the organisation behind the campaign, said that consumer awareness in China of the impact of the trade in ivory and rhino horn has grown rapidly over the past two years.  Reports released this week by WildAid found that 95% of those surveyed agree the Chinese government should impose a ban on the ivory trade. They also found that 70.6% believe elephant poaching is a problem, compared with 46.6% in 2012.  The prince\u2019s first visit to China has been the highest profile royal visit to the country in 30 years since the Queen\u2019s tour in 1986. He has made a better impression than his father, who famously described Chinese officials as \u201cappalling old waxworks\u201d in a leaked diary at the time of the Hong Kong handover in 1997.  The prince kicked off his four-day visit in Beijing where he met Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People and presented the president with an official invitation from the Queen for a state visit later this year. They discussed a number of topics including their shared interest in football. The visit has also been used to promote British business ties with China. In Shanghai, the prince opened the GREAT Festival of Creativity that aims to create jobs by supporting UK companies looking to break into Chinese markets. Partnerships between the UK and China in film, TV, healthcare and tourism were announced at the festival, and the prince met with business leaders including Jack Ma of Alibaba, the richest man in China. To mark football being added to the national school curriculum, the prince joined a football master class with coaches who are trained by the Premier League at the Nanyang High School in Shanghai.

China\u2019s relentless economic growth is self evident in Beijing and its big cities but it is reassuring that there are still parts of this vast country which remain relatively unspoilt.  Yunnan covers 4% of China\u2019s land, but boasts 60% of its species and the Prince chose to end his China tour by visiting Elephant Valley in the Xishuangbanna Forest Nature Reserve. His aim was to focus on one of his great passions \u2013 conservation of Africa\u2019s wildlife. It is a subject that he is well versed in having spent a great deal of time in Africa - a part of the world that he cares deeply about. His China visit has given him the chance to see conservation work in the region but, more importantly, the chance to meet president Xi Jinping, with whom the delicate issue of the illegal wildlife trade and China\u2019s consumption of ivory and rhino horn was openly discussed on Monday. Having spent the first two days successfully promoting political, trade and cultural links, his final day has been all about seeing, listening, and learning of the conservation challenges faced in this part of the world.    Related: Prince William in China: illegal wildlife trade a 'vicious form of criminality'    Conservation is ultimately about people. The prince knows this well from witnessing firsthand community programmes funded by Tusk in Africa. So it was no surprise that for his first engagement at a Dai village he took great interest in the problems faced by this rural community protecting their crops from China\u2019s 250 remaining elephants living in the neighbouring reserve.  It strikes me that coming to see China\u2019s last remnant population of elephant is highly symbolic. Are we witnessing what Africa might be like in a decade or two if the slaughter of its elephants continues unchecked? The irony is that in a country where demand for ivory is pushing Africa\u2019s elephants to the brink, here in Yunnan the Chinese State Forestry Administration is proud of their efforts to protect and slowly increase the population again.  And if to emphasize the point, as part of the visit, the prince was introduced to a habituated elephant, Ran Ran, which had been found and rescued by 80 villagers having been caught in a huge iron trap.  The prince clearly enjoyed meeting a group of young conservation students eager to ensure that theirs is not the last to see wild elephants in China. Throughout the trip there was real evidence that China\u2019s youth is increasingly becoming engaged in promoting conservation and concerned with pollution and climate change.      Later in the day, the prince spoke passionately at a regional conservation conference about the brutal reality of an illicit trade now estimated to be worth $20bn a year to the criminal syndicates who exploit it.  \u201cIt is a vicious form of criminality: plundering the natural resources of poorer countries, taking lives, hindering development and spreading corruption. It erodes the rule of law, fuels conflict, and may even fund terrorism,\u201d he said.  However, he was also careful to applaud the Chinese leadership for banning shark fin soup from the menu of all state banquets \u2013 a move that has seen a 70% reduction in the devastating shark fin market and he clearly wanted to encourage more.  \u201cWe have to conserve our planet \u2013 to provide security and prosperity for all people, and indeed to sustain humanity,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe extinction of animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins would be an immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity,\u201d  In concluding, the prince encouraged China to become \u201ca global leader in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade\u201d and adding, \u201cno tradition or fashion is worth the extinction of an entire species, and no criminal gang should be allowed to destroy any part of nature.\u201d  The fact that this 32-year old prince has been able to eloquently raise and discuss this issue at the highest possible level with both the presidents of America and China within just four months is an extraordinary achievement and illustrates his unquestionable commitment to the cause.  As he returns to London, the question that the conservation world now waits to see is whether China will indeed take the next step of banning the ivory trade outright.

The study \u2013 based on the OECD\u2019s international tests and surveys \u2013 suggests school performance both worldwide and in the UK could be boosted by improving attitudes among girls towards tackling maths and science, and by parents encouraging girls to consider careers involving subjects such as engineering.    Gender disparities in performance do not stem from innate differences in aptitude  OECD report     The OECD\u2019s research found that girls do worse than boys in maths, and that boys come out top even among high-performing students, in countries that took part in the OECD\u2019s assessments of 15-year-olds. The OECD said: \u201cWhat emerges from these analyses is particularly worrying. Even many high-achieving girls have low levels of confidence in their ability to solve science and mathematics problems and express high levels of anxiety towards mathematics.\u201d Yet girls were also found to have more positive attitudes to school in general, did more homework, more often read for pleasure and were less likely to play video games \u2013 so that far fewer girls than boys were among underachieving school pupils. Finland \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s best performing countries in OECD tests overall \u2013 had more than twice as many boys as girls among its low achievers. The UK came out relatively well, with almost no gender gap seen between boys and girls among the worst performing pupils. \u201cGender disparities in performance do not stem from innate differences in aptitude, but rather from students\u2019 attitudes towards learning and their behaviour in school, from how they choose to spend their leisure time, and from the confidence they have,\u201d the report said. As proof, the report noted that girls in Shanghai \u2013 the highest performing entrant in the last round of OECD tests \u2013 scored more highly in maths than boys in most other countries. The OECD pinned the blame for the disadvantage for girls in maths and science on low expectations among parents and teachers, as well as lack of self-confidence and what it called the ability to \u201cthink like a scientist\u201d in answering problems. \u201cThis gender difference in the ability to think like a scientist may be related to students\u2019 self-confidence. When students are more self-confident, they give themselves the freedom to fail, to engage in the trial-and-error processes that are fundamental to acquiring knowledge in mathematics and science,\u201d the OECD said. Girls were more likely than boys to report that they \u201cjust weren\u2019t good at maths\u201d and less likely to agree that maths was one of their best subjects. Girls in the UK appeared to be particularly vulnerable to low self-confidence hampering their ability in maths and science. British boys outperformed girls in science exercises by 20 percentage points \u2013 but the gap disappeared when the performances were adjusted for levels of self-confidence. In other words: girls who said they were good at science performed as well as boys with the same attitude, while girls and boys lacking in self-confidence achieved results that were similar to each other. In maths, British girls were outscored by boys in tests \u2013 but the gap was reversed when attitudes were taken into account. The problem, however, is that many more girls lack confidence in their mathematical and scientific ability than their male peers. In the UK, the position was made worse by the very high correlation between mathematical and science test performance and self-confidence in those subjects. As a result, lack of confidence is potentially holding the UK back from performing better in international league tables such as the OECD\u2019s triennial Pisa tests. Alun Jones, head of the Girls\u2019 School Association, said that he agreed with the OECD\u2019s assessment, but said that girls could be encouraged to \u201cthink like a scientist\u201d in the right environment and through exposure to scientific roles. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with centuries of gender bias and what people and parents think and say, often without realising it, does influence children\u2019s expectations of themselves. \u201cGirls\u2019 schools can\u2019t eradicate this kind of cultural conditioning, but we can take significant steps towards minimising it and the results indicate that this does boost girls\u2019 confidence in their maths and science abilities,\u201d Jones said. Pupils at all-girls schools are more likely to study subjects such as physics and maths to A-level. The OECD research tallies with recent examination results in England. While girls do better overall, boys outperform them in maths and sciences other than biology, and study those subjects in greater numbers in higher education.", "tags": ["Education", "OECD", "World news", "Schools"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-05T10:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/06/china-takes-environmental-documentary-off-the-web", "sentences": ["The Financial Times said an employee at a Shanghai newspaper had been suspended on suspicion of leaking that directive."], "title": "China takes environmental documentary that went viral off the web", "article": "China has begun deleting the documentary about smog that became an overnight sensation, notching up hundreds of millions of views.

The page on the website of the official People\u2019s Daily that was dedicated to the documentary had also been removed. That may suggest disagreements among those in authority over the film.

Plus, when foreign media report the documentary and the public discussion, it becomes an incident. \u201cSecondly, the authorities might be worrying that the discussion of the documentary overshadow the annual conferences.\u201d The conferences, held annually in the spring, started this week. Figures in the energy sector had complained about aspects of the documentary.  Some also wonder if today\u2019s move is an attempt to reduce attention before the ministry of environmental protection hosts a press conference on Saturday. This week the central propaganda department ordered media not to report on the documentary, tamping down attention without attempting to suppress the film at that stage.

These are not realistic interpretations, though: they\u2019re drawn largely from memories and photos. Complimenting this, he\u2019s also creating one of his ongoing \u201cspace paintings\u201d. Daubed directly on the walls between H&amp;W\u2019s two galleries, it will respond to the surrounding landscape. Hauser &amp; Wirth Somerset, Tue to 21 Jun SS Joshua Reynolds, London Joshua Reynolds was one of Georgian Britain\u2019s creative power-players. He was the first president of the Royal Academy and a linchpin of The Club, an elite gang that included Samuel Johnson and fabled actor David Garrick. Those he painted ran from aristocrats to war heroes to superstar actors. Yet was he a great artist? For all of their finesse, his paintings have acquired a so-so reputation in recent decades. Where Hogarth\u2019s A Rake\u2019s Progress or Smollett\u2019s Roderick Random deliver a rambunctious vision of 18th-century life, Reynolds\u2019s perspective can seem conservative. This show sets out to rescue his reputation, reinstating him as a radical innovator. Works run from soulful to hot stuff, and include his deliciously minxy depiction of the south London socialite and courtesan Mary Nesbitt. The Wallace Collection, W1, Thu to 7 Jun SS Potential Architecture, London Historically, utopian architecture proposals have been big on the wow factor and low on likelihood. Here, four leading radical architects from around the globe marry far-out ideas with focused social commentary. Joar Nango has created a Mongolian community cinema; Alexander Brodsky critiques Russia\u2019s unregulated building industry with a pavilion of plastic cladding; sociologist Apolonija Su\u0161ter\u0161i\u010d has built a platform for debating London gentrification; and Sean Griffiths has crafted a labyrinth that rethinks our relationship to real and illusionistic space. Ambika P3, NW1, Wed to 19 Apr SS Possiblities Of The Object, Edinburgh This group exhibition of Brazilian sculpture from over the last 60 years is an aesthetic and intellectual joy. Since the 1950s a host of Brazilian sculptors have been sidestepping easy definitions of what they do. The medium\u2019s ongoing metamorphosis has necessitated new terms \u2013 \u201cactive-object\u201d, \u201crelational object\u201d, \u201ctrans-object\u201d, \u201cpoem object\u201d \u2013 to better explain its ideal of creative playfulness and evocative ambiguity. Early abstracts by Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica, exhibited here, are typically angulated, enfolded, elegant, and more likely to be fashioned from polyvinyl acetate resin and painted iron than traditional bronze. More recent pieces by their contemporaries are harder to tie down. Small but highly sensuous objects by Ernesto Neto look like sex aids, hardly items to be secured on a gallery plinth and gawked at. Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, to 25 May RC Leonora Carrington, Liverpool With this, the first UK solo exhibition of her work for over 20 years, Leonora Carrington\u2019s time may finally have arrived. For too long she has been remembered as the token female surrealist painter - surely now she can be recognised as something special? Hybrid monsters, giant eggs, spectral white horses, Heathcliffian heroes, everything filtered through a rainbow haze, Carrington\u2019s fantasies \u2013 once dismissed as the indulgence of a fairytale sentimentalist \u2013 can now be accepted as multicultural cross-association. From an upper-class upbringing in Lancashire, Carrington fled, via a spell among Paris\u2019s surrealists, to find a lifetime\u2019s inspiration amid the revolutionary intensity of Mexico. Included here is her 4.5m 1964 mural The Magical World Of The Mayas, a dreamlike panorama in which collective psychic transformation is posited as a distinct possibility. Tate Liverpool, to 31 Mar RC Russell Mills, Halifax Cut-and-paste collage may have formed the compositional backbone of 20th-century art, but Russell Mills takes the tradition into moodier realms of disorientation, mixing paints with ashes, teeth and crushed glass. Cargo In The Blood includes collages and sound installations, all of which are imbued with a painter\u2019s penchant for productive mess. A central set of 30 works were commissioned for Hesitation Marks, the 2013 album by industrial rockers Nine Inch Nails. Now Then is a new installation in the bowels of the building. Such scrapbook accumulations and nocturnal atmospherics look less self-consciously built up than ingeniously grown, conjured, or revealed by chance erasures.

Two years ago her father, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who came to England on the Kindertransport as a boy in 1938, died in hospital in \u201cutterly miserable\u201d circumstances after a\u00a0mistakenly prescribed double dose of\u00a0antibiotics destroyed his liver. The year before that, Samson\u2019s friend, the journalist Cassandra Jardine, died of lung cancer. And the year before that, Samson\u2019s eldest son Charlie went to prison after admitting \u201cviolent disorder\u201d for his part in an attack on Topshop that\u00a0followed the tuition fee protests of\u00a0December 2010, during which he was pictured on the bonnet of Prince Charles\u2019s car and hanging from a flag on the Cenotaph. At times she found it difficult to focus on anything else. The first draft of the story that grew into The Kindness was framed by an account of a prison visit. Then there was a plan for an intriguing combination of novella and linked short stories. But over the course of the\u00a0miles-long walks she takes from her house on a bustling corner of the sea front at Hove, Samson gathered her\u00a0material together and stitched it into the densely plotted, dynamic domestic thriller \u2013 with an English idyll of ivy-covered house, meadow and hammock on the cover \u2013 that is sitting on the coffee table in front of us. \u201cIt\u2019s the most gleeful sort of writing there is,\u201d she says from the large sofa where she is smoking roll-ups and looking out to sea. \u201cFor days I\u2019d be thinking, how does this happen? How do the characters not know this information or how do we not know it? All those technical problems. That\u2019s the thing about walking \u2013 or sleeping, it\u2019s the same \u2013 it\u00a0just solves them and then you\u00a0can\u2019t wait to get back to the top of\u00a0the house.\u201d    I had no access to my\u00a0Jewish family but finding out about them has given me a stronger sense of who I am    By coincidence, following the triumph of Helen Macdonald\u2019s memoir H Is for Hawk, The Kindness opens with a falconry scene, but swiftly moves indoors to trace the contours of grief. Julian has lost both partner Julia and daughter Mira, and is stuck in a country house with their ghosts, his overbearing mum and needy former girlfriend. From empty picture frames and beds the novel moves backwards, to the couple\u2019s ever-so-romantic beginnings, their grotty L-shaped flat, and the accidental pregnancy and miscarriage that preceded Mira. On a whim, we learn, Julian moved the family back to his picturesque childhood home, Firdaws. Then childhood cancer struck: blood tests, scans, tubes, \u201cpale, curdy sick\u201d. The novel is contemporary but deeply indebted to the past. Samson\u2019s grandmother used to say the family lost \u201cjust two aunts\u201d in the Holocaust, but since her father\u2019s death, and aided by a trunk of papers she inherited, Samson has become obsessed with piecing together the truth. In particular she is interested in\u00a0her great-uncle Heino, who killed himself in the 1970s and whose black-and-white photograph of painter Mark Rothko sits behind her on a shelf. The feelings of living people mean she must be careful what she reveals, but she has drawn on\u00a0family secrets in The Kindness and recently went to Paris to meet the woman Heino loved in later life. \u201cMy father was from Hamburg and most of his family got out, but like a lot of people he didn\u2019t want to talk about Germany, the war or the Holocaust,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was sealed off, and when we went to live in Cornwall\u201d \u2013 in 1970 when she\u00a0was eight \u2013 \u201cties were pretty much severed with everyone except my grandmother. I had no access to my\u00a0Jewish family at all but they did all the things I do \u2013 they wrote, they took pictures \u2013 and finding out about them has given me a much stronger sense of who I am.\u201d Samson\u2019s husband is David Gilmour, the musician, best known for being in\u00a0Pink Floyd, with whom she has two sons and a daughter. Gilmour, who is\u00a016\u00a0years her senior, has\u00a0four adult children from his first marriage and Samson\u2019s son Charlie also comes from a previous relationship, though Gilmour adopted him. They are a modern blended family, but what is striking about Samson\u2019s background is\u00a0that this\u00a0is nothing new. Second and\u00a0third marriages and webs of siblings go back\u00a0at least two generations to her grandmother, an East End\u00a0chambermaid of Jewish or Romany origins who\u00a0married the scion of a well-to-do Shanghai family but was sent back to England following the 1937 Japanese invasion, leaving her husband to start\u00a0again. Samson\u2019s mother Esther was six at the time, and she and her brothers went first to a children\u2019s home and then to what Samson calls \u201cpretty scary foster parents\u201d. She survived to fall in with a\u00a0group of Spanish communist students, marry a Chinese-American war hero and smuggle herself to China. There, she found a set of half-siblings, though not her father, and stayed for 10 years, serving in the Red Army and working as an interpreter for journalists including the Daily Worker\u2019s Alan Winnington, who became her second husband. Samson\u2019s parents met in East Berlin, when the British Communist party gave her father the job of trying to get Winnington out of China, where he was stuck without a passport. They fell\u00a0in love and had Polly before marrying in 1969, but Winnington remained a\u00a0long-distance member of the family, with his son and Esther\u2019s child by her previous relationship brought up with Polly, who grew up calling her biological father \u201cLance\u201d and Winnington \u201cDaddy\u201d.     Polly Samson with her husband David Gilmour. Photograph: Dave M Benett/Getty Images    Asked whether her first novel, Out of the Picture (2001), which she dedicated to Charlie and is all about a young woman\u2019s attempts to reconnect with her absent artist-father, expressed the hope that Charlie might in some way reconnect with his own lost parent, the\u00a0poet Heathcote Williams, Samson says she wonders if the book wasn\u2019t more about herself. Contact with Winnington, the second father of her early years, suddenly stopped: \u201cNo one thought I might have a yearning and looking back now I\u00a0think I did.\u201d She later learned he had kept one of her baby shoes all his life. Samson\u2019s parents stuck with the Communist party through the Soviet invasion of Czechslovakia and gave up their membership quietly in the 1970s. Her father went from the Daily Worker (now the Morning Star) to the Packet group of local newspapers in Cornwall, where her half-Chinese mother became head of a village school. \u201cMy parents very much enjoyed each other\u2019s company and didn\u2019t really need anyone else,\u201d she says. \u201cWe lived in an old tin-mining village that even people in the next town had never heard of. They didn\u2019t have a lot of friends or do\u00a0much socialising. Maybe they just wanted a rest.\u201d Samson had virtually dropped out of school by\u00a014, but at her grandmother\u2019s urging she moved to London and got a secretarial job in publishing, from where she rose to become head publicist at Jonathan Cape. She began a relationship with Williams, moved back to Cornwall and in 1989 had their son. When Williams walked out, Samson returned to London in a \u201cterrible state\u201d and was offered a\u00a0place to stay by Jardine, a virtual stranger who became a close friend. She married Gilmour five years later, only deciding she believed in marriage as they arrived at Marylebone town hall. Today they preside over their \u201chuge tribe of children\u201d and the vast German shepherd she got from a rescue home at\u00a0the height of her anxiety about Charlie\u2019s incarceration. She has taken up smoking again, suffers from stage fright so\u00a0acute that she takes beta-blockers before public appearances, and\u00a0travels to London each week to see\u00a0a\u00a0psychotherapist. A \u201creally, really secret writer\u201d for many years, Samson wrote her first novel in six weeks because she wanted it finished before her short stories came\u00a0out and bad reviews crushed her\u00a0confidence. In the event critics were enthusiastic: her new novel has received much advance praise and she has moved to a new publisher after a\u00a0prolonged courtship. At Gilmour\u2019s urging she also revealed herself as his lyricist, and lights up with excitement when she plays me rough versions of a\u00a0couple of tracks on his forthcoming album. One was inspired by book two of Paradise Lost; another by a painting on the wall above the fireplace. Samson suffered a pang about her\u00a0own lack of education when she delivered her son Charlie to Cambridge. She struggled in her 20s, she says, when \u201ceveryone else had a gang from university\u201d. Reading Paradise Lost, which features in her novel as well as Gilmour\u2019s song, she thought: \u201cI would love to be going to lectures. I would love someone to set me an essay on this.\u201d When stuck with her writing she took to spending long days at the piano, having begun lessons to help her children before deciding to take the\u00a0exams herself. Her last book of short stories had the\u00a0ironic title Perfect Lives. Since then Samson has had what she calls \u201cabout the most horrible experience of my life\u201d, visiting her son in prison: \u201cThey make it\u00a0about as unpleasant as they can. The\u00a0glass is smeared with semen and\u00a0you speak through a kind of box. I\u00a0had\u00a0one or two of my younger children with me\u00a0and it was terrible for them.\u201d She remains angry about what happened, and critical of legislation that meant Charlie was convicted of \u201cviolent disorder\u201d although he didn\u2019t attack anyone. But as she sets out for her afternoon walk with songs to write rather than a\u00a0plot twist to resolve \u2013 she is where she wants to be: \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve hit my lyrical stride,\u201d she says. \u201cI am so in the mood for this.\u201d \u2022 The Kindness is published by Bloomsbury Circus.", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-07T11:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/09/sarah-brown-57-million-children-school-campaign-interview", "sentences": ["Bec and her team can\u2019t let the message stand in the way of their business, but there can still be a connection around creativity and branding and spreading a message online.\u201d From Brown\u2019s vantage point in this glass and steel tower \u2013 so sleek that it stood in for a Shanghai skyscraper in the Bond film Skyfall \u2013 you can watch the weather fronts as they approach, rolling in across the city from the west."], "title": "Sarah Brown's mission to send 57 million children to school", "article": "Sarah Brown \u2013 global campaigner for health and education, ex-prime minister\u2019s wife, Twitter star \u2013 wants to talk about jewellery. Actually, what she really wants to talk about are the 57 million children worldwide who will never get a day in school. But a top-flight career in public relations and 13 years in residence at numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street have made Brown an expert on how to make people listen to and engage with a message, and these days she is convinced of the benefit of fashion as a campaigning partner. And so she is here to promote the bracelet she is wearing, made from sterling silver woven with sky-blue silk thread, sales of which will benefit Brown\u2019s global education charity, A World at School. The challenge of such a cause is that no one disagrees with it. There is no controversy with which to seize attention. \u201cNo one is going to say: \u2018Oh no, I don\u2019t think children should go to school,\u2019\u201d says Brown. We are 30 floors above Liverpool Street station, London, in the building where her charity works and Gordon\u2019s non-parliamentary offices are based. Brown, smartly dressed in navy trousers and jacket and a scarf printed with abstract squiggles, is friendly and warm in person, although she positively bristles with efficiency. Several times, when a question starts to ramble, she dives in and crisply rewords it for me before answering. It is not done in a rude or domineering way, but as the instinct of someone who can\u2019t imagine wasting time. \u201cWe have to create something desirable, which motivates people to actively ally their own personal brand with this cause. And no one knows better how to create that desire than the fashion industry,\u201d she says. Brown\u2019s association with fashion and campaigning goes back to the 1980s, when her brother worked with Lynne Franks, whose firm represented Katharine Hamnett. Her years at No 10 coincided with a crunch time for London fashion week, which was in danger of being squeezed out of existence between New York and Milan. Brown proved herself a champion of the industry, negotiating with Diane von Furstenberg and reviving the lapsed tradition of Downing Street fashion week receptions, and played a key role in successfully seeing off the challenge.  Along the way, she made high-profile allies such as Naomi Campbell, who became a prominent supporter of Brown\u2019s maternal mortality campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with so many people in the fashion industry, and they\u2019ve always been people who really get behind a campaign and come good on their promises. Historically, the campaigns that the fashion industry has attached itself to \u2013 I\u2019m thinking of HIV/Aids, and breast cancer \u2013 these have tended to be campaigns with a strong identity, a vision that people can get hold of, and that has helped to make them very effective.\u201d     Children in New Delhi fight for the right to go to school. Photograph: Atish Patel    The bracelet is a collaboration that Brown initiated with jeweller Astley Clarke: 20% of the price tag will go to A World at School and online shoppers will be urged to join the three million signatories of the petition for a global right to education. Eight years ago, having noticed Brown\u2019s name and Downing Street address attached to a jewellery order that had been placed online, founder Bec Astley Clarke slipped in a note introducing herself with the delivery, and the two became friends. \u201cBut I am realistic,\u201d says Brown. \u201cFundamentally, I\u2019m trying to implement change, and fashion does not exist primarily to do good in the world. Bec and her team can\u2019t let the message stand in the way of their business, but there can still be a connection around creativity and branding and spreading a message online.\u201d From Brown\u2019s vantage point in this glass and steel tower \u2013 so sleek that it stood in for a Shanghai skyscraper in the Bond film Skyfall \u2013 you can watch the weather fronts as they approach, rolling in across the city from the west. But then, Brown has always been savvy about knowing which way the wind is blowing. She joined Twitter early: \u201cBecause when we moved from No 11 to No 10 [in 2007] we needed to make ourselves more publicly available, and since Gordon and I wanted to keep the kids out of the public eye, I knew it was up to me to fill that space.\u201d Twitter, on which she now has 1.2 million followers, allowed her to speak in her own voice, \u201crather than talking to journalists and leaving it up to them to translate what they decided I had meant to say. Also, 140 characters is perfect for my concentration span.\u201d Last week, Brown piggybacked Twitter\u2019s \u201cthrowback Thursday\u201d meme, enlisting supporters such as Arianna Huffington and Miranda Hart to post photos of themselves as schoolgirls in support of the 31 million girls worldwide who are denied an education. \u201cThe fundamental change in the past few years is that everybody has their own brand, their own online identity, their own social media channels. If you want to be effective, you have to work with that. You have to create a unified call for action in a way that enables people to be their own brand,\u201d she says. In other words: people are motivated to help others by the opportunity to post selfies. And if Brown finds anything negative in this development, she is too practical a campaigner to bemoan it publicly.     The London launch of the campaign to get all children into school. Photograph: Oliver Dixon/Imagewise    She is sanguine, too, about the pressures an association with fashion brings. \u201cI enjoy fashion, but the reality of my schedule is that I have very limited time for hair and nails and makeup. To me, it\u2019s a fairly straightforward tradeoff between results, and the amount of time I\u2019m prepared to devote to it. I\u2019m comfortable with that. Every once in a while I think: right, today I\u2019m going to make an effort, and I\u2019m going to enjoy it, but on the whole I\u2019m not prepared to curate my life around my wardrobe.\u201d The one fashion decision she regrets is the day she let the pressure get to her, she says. When Carla Bruni came on her infamous Dior-clad state visit in 2008: \u201cI took advice from too many people, and ended up wearing something I wasn\u2019t comfortable in. It was a perfectly nice outfit, but it wasn\u2019t me. I got that one wrong.\u201d These days, the Browns live in Fife with sons John, 11, and Fraser, eight, juggling work trips to London between them. \u201cThe boys are used to us both having busy lives,\u201d she shrugs. Gordon\u2019s take on parenting has mellowed in the post-Downing Street years, she says. \u201cYou start off thinking you want your kids to be successful, but actually these days he\u2019s much more of a view that you just want them to be happy. I think he\u2019s a bit surprised by how strongly he feels that now.\u201d\u00a0 Both work diaries are still packed, \u201cbut it\u2019s so much more manageable now, because we are more in control. The trouble with political life is all the things come out of nowhere and blindside you.\u201d Her focus until the end of this year is those 57 million children \u201cwho all the UN countries signed up to promise they would have in school by the end of 2015 \u2013 which gives them months to deliver on that promise\u201d. The thing is, she says, the goal is entirely achievable. \u201cThe costs are not actually very high, in global terms. There\u2019s no rocket science involved. You don\u2019t have to find a cure. This is a problem that can be solved. But you have to get the right people to listen and then to actually do something.\u201d", "tags": ["Sarah Brown", "Education", "Politics", "Global development", "Charities", "Voluntary sector", "Society", "Women's jewellery", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-09T17:40:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/10/cuts-sixth-form-part-time-education", "sentences": ["Sixth form colleges will be forced to cut direct tuition from 18 hours to 15, which is half what their peers in high-performing education systems such as those in Shanghai and Singapore receive, the report claims."], "title": "Cuts mean sixth-form students will get part-time education, says report", "article": "Sixth form students will get little more than a part-time education as a result of funding cuts that will bite next year, according to a new report. Sixth form colleges will be forced to cut direct tuition from 18 hours to 15, which is half what their peers in high-performing education systems such as those in Shanghai and Singapore receive, the report claims. Amid the ongoing battle over education funding ahead of May\u2019s general election, the report by the Sixth Form Colleges Association warns that English sixth formers risk being left behind by international competitors as a result of a \u201clow hours, short duration\u201d sixth form model. In Asian/Pacific countries which excel in the PISA global league tables, students receive 30+ hours a week of tuition; in Nordic countries such as Sweden students are allowed to fewer hours but extended over three years of study. Prof Ken Spours of the UCL Institute of Education, which carried out the international comparison in the SFCA report, said: \u201cOur research suggests that state-funded sixth form education in England is out of step with other international systems and the weakness of our low-hours, short-duration model is being exacerbated by ongoing cuts to funding. \u201cThis will make it increasingly difficult for young people in England to compete for jobs and opportunities in the global economy.\u201d Educationalists agree that a rounded sixth form curriculum should be based on a baccalaureate model which, as well as qualifications, values enrichment activities and work experience to develop the \u201csoft\u201d skills essential to higher study and employability. However, an analysis in the report of sixth form college finances by independent analysts London Economics has shown that there is a significant gap between this aspiration and the financial reality. Survey evidence shows sixth form colleges reduced the teaching workforce by 13% between 2010 and 2012, at the same time as student numbers increased by 1.5%.  By 2016-17, the report says, sixth form colleges will require extra funding to support an additional 7-10 hours of direct teaching if they are to deliver a worthwhile curriculum, which will cost at least \u00a31,000 more per student than the current planned settlement. David Igoe, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: \u201cThe government will maintain that it is funding sixth formers to study on a full-time basis. But there is a big difference between the way the Department for Education defines full-time study for funding purposes and the reality of what a full-time education actually involves. \u201cFrom next year, institutions will only be able to afford to put a teacher in front of students for around half the 30 hours they are actually in college. Our young people miss out on having that direct teaching and support which is vital to their progress.\u201d", "tags": ["Sixth form", "Politics", "Education", "Society", "UK news", "Schools"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-10T00:57:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/11/revolution-changing-way-your-child-taught", "sentences": ["But the reason Shanghai\u2019s schools are recognised as among the best in the world is because their teachers never stop thinking about how to get better at teaching.", "When Marc Tucker, the president of NCEE, an American education thinktank, went to Shanghai, he discovered a system designed to elicit continual improvement.", "The Shanghai system, Tucker said, revolves around the premise that \u201cnot only is it possible for you to get better, it is your job to get better and it never ends\u201d."], "title": "The revolution that\u2019s changing the way your child is taught | Ian Leslie", "article": "The video does not seem remarkable on first viewing.

Hinton, a blonde woman in a colourful silk scarf, stands before a class of eight- and nine-year-old boys and girls, almost all of whom are African-American. \u201cWhat might a character be feeling in a story?\u201d she asks. She repeats the question, before engaging her pupils in a high-tempo conversation about what it is like to read a book and why authors write them, as she moves smartly around her classroom.

He sees that after she first asks a question, hands that spring up immediately go back down again, in response to an almost imperceptible gesture from Hinton, to give the other children more time to think (\u201cwait time\u201d). He sees her repeat the question so that this pause in the conversation doesn\u2019t slow its rhythm. He sees Hinton constantly changing the angle of her gaze to check that every pupil is paying attention to whoever in the room is speaking, and silencing anyone who is not doing so with a subtle wave of her hand. He sees her use similar gestures to gently but effectively recall errant students into line without interrupting her own flow or that of the student speaking at the time (\u201cnon-verbal corrections\u201d). He sees Hinton venture away from the hotspots to move down the sides of the class, letting her students know, with her movement, that there is always a chance she will be beside their desk in the next few seconds. He sees that in one particular instance she moves toward a particular student while making it look to the rest of the class as if she is simply changing her perspective, so that she can correct his behaviour without embarrassing him \u2013 and he sees that she does so with the grace of an elite tennis player delivering a disguised drop shot. He sees that Hinton is smiling throughout, beaming warmth to her class, and varying the volume of her voice to convey enthusiasm for her topic. He sees that children from one of the poorest neighbourhoods in America \u2013 children who elsewhere might have been tacitly expected to misbehave, or to withhold their attention from a class on English literature \u2013 are utterly captivated, eager to pitch in with their own thoughts, avid for learning. He sees, finally, that behind this self-effacing display of apparently effortless mastery there are thousands of hours of deliberate, carefully considered practise. *** Lemov never considered himself a brilliant teacher. When he taught at a school in a poor neighbourhood of Boston, he enjoyed training days, and left them eager to apply what he had learned in planning the next day\u2019s lessons. Then the next day arrived, and his plan collapsed: instead of inspiring kids with his enthusiasm for English or history, he spent his time imploring them to be quiet when he was talking and to stop throwing pens. In the staffroom one day, a more experienced colleague gave him a piece of advice. \u201cWhen you want them to follow your directions, stand still. If you\u2019re walking around passing out papers it looks like the directions are no more important than all of the other things you\u2019re doing.\u201d This was a revelation. It was exactly the kind of guidance \u2013 clear, practical, precise \u2013 that Lemov had been missing. And it worked. Lemov, who has an MBA from Harvard, likes precision, and he likes to break a problem down into its component parts before putting together an answer. That was how he set about solving the problem of becoming a better teacher, and it is also how he thinks about the problem that preoccupies him more than any other: closing the \u201cachievement gap\u201d between poor students and everyone else. In fact he has come to see the two problems as inextricably linked.     Doug Lemov passes on his classroom tips to a workshop of newly qualified teachers, at Walworth Academy, London. Photograph: Graham Turne    After leaving the school in Boston, Lemov worked for a time as a consultant to failing schools. He came to realise that although he might be able to help them implement better assessment systems, or to use technology more effectively, nothing would work unless the teachers got better at helping the children learn. How could he help with that? Characteristically, he started with a spreadsheet. Cross-referencing test scores and demographics, he identified which schools were achieving the most exceptional results with poor students. Then he visited the classrooms of the best teachers in those schools with a videographer. He watched and rewatched the lessons he recorded, like a football coach studying the tape of a game, analysing in minute detail what these outstanding teachers were doing. He gave names to the techniques he saw them use. Then he circulated his notes to the teachers he worked with. Those teachers passed them on to teachers they knew, who passed them on in turn, until the document, known at that time only as \u201cthe taxonomy\u201d, took on a samizdat life of its own. Lemov realised how far word of it had spread when a teacher from California got in touch to request a copy. In 2010, he was persuaded to turn his notes into a book, which became a surprise best-seller in education circles. In its latest edition, Teach Like a Champion lists \u201c62 techniques that put students on the path to college\u201d. Lemov says that some of the advice in the book is probably wrong, and he does not pretend it is comprehensive. But it has become the key text of an incipient transformation of teaching that has little to do with government edict or official policy. *** Hardly anything matters more than education, yet when we talk about education we spend a lot of time arguing over things that do not matter very much. Class sizes, uniforms, curriculum design, which politician runs the Department for Education \u2013 none of our favourite flashpoints make a lot of difference to whether children do well at school. For all that parents worry over which school to send their children to, more important is who teaches them when they get there. Professor John Hattie, of the University of Melbourne, has undertaken a rigorous assessment of the thousands of empirical studies that have been carried out on educational achievement. He concluded that, other than the raw cognitive ability of the child herself, only one variable really counts: \u201cWhat teachers do, know and care about.\u201d The evidence suggests that a child at a bad school taught by a good teacher is better off than one with a bad teacher at a good school. The benefits of having been in the class of a good teacher cascade down the years; the same is true of the penalty for having had a bad teacher. Such effects do not fall evenly upon the population: the children who gain most from good teachers are those from disadvantaged homes in which parental time, money and books are in short supply. Being in the classroom of a great teacher is the best hope these children have of catching up with their more fortunate peers. In 1992, an economist called Eric Hanushek reached a remarkable conclusion by analysing decades of data on teacher effectiveness: a student in the class of a very ineffective teacher \u2013 one ranked in the bottom 5% \u2013 will learn, on average, half a year\u2019s worth of material in one school year, whereas if she was in the class of a very effective teacher \u2013 in the top 5% \u2013 she would learn a year and a half\u2019s worth of material. In other words, the difference between a good and a bad teacher is worth a whole year.    A child at a bad school taught by a good teacher is better off than one with a bad teacher at a good school    Hanushek\u2019s proposed solution to the question of how to raise educational standards was brutally simple: fire the worst 10% of teachers and replace them with better ones. Education reformers in America used his findings to argue that schools should have more power to sack under-performing teachers and attract better ones with higher salaries. This \u201caccountability\u201d movement, backed by politicians such as Barack Obama and philanthropists including Bill Gates, has been closely associated with the rise of charter schools in the US and academies in Britain. But it has turned out to be a lot harder than reformers initially envisaged to raise standards. Performance pay has had mixed results, and it has proven difficult to systematically separate good and bad teachers. The reformers can point to some striking successes, but overall, children at charter schools and academies are no more likely to do well than children at run-of-the-mill schools. Meanwhile, teaching unions on both sides of the Atlantic have stubbornly resisted attempts to differentiate between effective and ineffective teachers \u2013 and they are quick to level accusations of \u201cteacher-bashing\u201d at those who attempt to do so. This is understandable. Politicians can take an unholy glee in berating \u201cbad teachers\u201d, and you do not have to be paranoid to see such rhetoric as a thinly disguised attack on the whole profession. On the other hand, given that teaching is such a demanding and complex job, it would be bizarre if there was not a wide gap between the best performers and the worst. Globalisation has increased the pressure on education systems to improve, but the pressure is now coming from the bottom up too. The rise of charter schools and academies has precipitated a Cambrian explosion of new ideas and innovations, stimulating a debate about methodology led by teachers themselves. The internet has provided platforms for teachers to talk to other teachers, beyond their own schools and outside official oversight. On social media, teachers are sharing ideas, evidence and techniques, organising conferences on education research, and arguing about the most effective way to teach reading or maths. After years of debate among academics and politicians over how to raise teacher standards, the problem is being solved by the practitioners. And it has become apparent that the noisy argument over \u201cbad teachers\u201d was drowning out a much better question: how do you turn a bad teacher into a good one? And what makes a good teacher good? *** In 2010, the Los Angeles Times triggered a minor earthquake in a city familiar with such events. The Los Angeles school district \u2013 the second largest in the United States \u2013 had collected detailed data on the performance of its roughly 6,000 teachers, that it had not released. The newspaper used a freedom of information request to get its hands on this database, and after conducting an analysis, published a list of all the teachers in Los Angeles, ranked by effectiveness. It turned out that the very best teachers were getting results that were not only much better than low-ranked teachers, but twice as good as good teachers. At the very top of the list was a woman called Zenaida Tan. Tan taught at Morningside Elementary, a decent if unremarkable school with an intake of mainly poor students, many of whom struggled with English. Year after year, students were entering Tan\u2019s class with below-average ability in maths and English, and leaving it with above-average scores. You might imagine that before the Los Angeles Times published its rankings, Tan would have already been celebrated for her ability by her peers \u2013 that her brilliance would be well-known to fellow teachers eager to learn her secrets. You would be wrong on all counts. When the Los Angeles Times sent a correspondent to interview Tan, they found her quietly carrying out her work, unheralded except by those who had taken her class and knew what a difference it had made to their lives. \u201cNobody tells me that I\u2019m a strong teacher,\u201d Tan told the reporter. She guessed that her colleagues thought her \u201cstrict, even mean\u201d. On a recent evaluation, her headmaster noted she had been late to pick up her students from recess three times. It was as if Lionel Messi\u2019s teammates considered him a useful midfielder who needed to work on his tackling. There is entrenched resistance, in the education establishment, to singling out individuals, even to praise or emulate them. The only options for Tan\u2019s evaluation were \u201cmeets standard performance\u201d and \u201cbelow standard performance\u201d. But if Tan and others like her go unnoticed it is also because they do not look the part. Ask someone to describe a great teacher, and they are likely to conjure up someone like Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society: eccentric, flamboyant, prone to leaping on to desks. When we see a teacher effortlessly commanding her class\u2019s attention, our instinct is to put it down to some quality of their personality \u2013 great teachers, it is said, just have something. They are possessed of an innate ability to inspire. Sam Freedman, the head of research at Teach First, which places high-achieving graduates into schools with disadvantaged intakes, said that even among teachers, there is hostility to the notion that what they do can be analysed and replicated: \u201cThe idea of learning heuristics seems bad because you\u2019re not discovering your inner teacher.\u201d But the myth of the magical teacher subtly undermines the status of teaching, by obscuring the extraordinary skill required to perform the job to a high level. It also implies that great teaching cannot be taught. At training college, budding teachers learn theories of child development and are told about the importance of concepts such as \u201cfeedback\u201d and \u201chigh expectations\u201d. But they get surprisingly little help with actual teaching. Imagine being told you need to show high expectations of your students. \u201cIt\u2019s like telling a kid to get better GCSEs,\u201d Jenny Thompson, a teacher at Dixons Trinity Academy in Bradford, told me. The reason teachers respond so enthusiastically to Doug Lemov\u2019s ideas is that he is right there with them at the front of the class.     Jenny Thompson teaching at Dixons Trinity Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    Tall and wide-chested, Lemov is built like an American football player. In fact, his favourite sport is soccer, which he played at college in upstate New York. His coaches there did not spend much time discussing the game in the abstract. Instead, they told him to \u201cnarrow the angle\u201d or \u201cclose the space\u201d. In his books and workshops, Lemov talks about what pace to move around the classroom, what language to use when praising a student, how to adjust the angle of your head to let students know you\u2019re looking at them. Teaching, he says, is \u201ca performance profession\u201d. Sports coaches know that what looks effortlessly achieved, like the way Roger Federer hits a backhand, is in fact the product of countless hours of practice and analysis. Faced with a problem \u2013 a weakness in their game \u2013 they break it down into parts and work on the execution of each one before putting it all back together. Successful sportspeople have what the psychologist Carol Dweck calls a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d \u2013 the belief that talent is intelligently applied effort in disguise. The ones who understand this principle best are those born without the supreme talent of a Federer \u2013 the ones who have had to strive for every millimetre of improvement. The best teachers do not necessarily understand how teaching works, because their own technique is invisible to them; sports psychologists call this \u201cexpert-induced amnesia\u201d. When the Los Angeles Times asked some of the teachers who topped their list what made them so effective, one replied that great teachers simply love their students and love their job: \u201cYou can\u2019t bottle that, and you can\u2019t teach it.\u201d Doug Lemov is on a mission to prove that talented teacher wrong. *** At Lemov\u2019s workshop, the teachers rehearsed asking questions and taking answers \u2013 not something I had imagined would require practice. A few minutes earlier, Lemov had cited research that found the average time a teacher leaves between question and answer is 1.5 seconds. That is not enough, he said. The teachers, all of whom had several years of experience, agreed. As they discussed why, I began to understand something about how absurdly difficult the job is, and the fundamental reason for its difficulty: thinking is invisible. Imagine you\u2019re a teacher, standing in front of your class. You ask a question: \u201cWhat was the immediate cause of the first world war?\u201d Three hands go up immediately. You decide which one to pick. \u201cOK, Leon.\u201d Leon gives the answer you taught last week: the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Things are going well, aren\u2019t they? But what if there is a child in the third row who was on her way to getting the answer right but gives up the moment she sees Leon raise his hand? What if there is another student, in the back row, who does not even bother thinking any more because he knows Leon always gets there first? Lemov played a clip of a teacher called Maggie Johnson. Johnson asks her class: \u201cWhat does Atticus say about mockingbirds?\u201d After leaving a gap of several seconds, she takes an answer. Lemov played the clip again and this time, with the help of the teachers in the room, he dissected Johnson\u2019s technique \u2013 showing how she used \u201cwait time\u201d to enact high expectations and make everyone in her class feel they might have an answer worth sharing. Before she has even finished asking the question, one boy has his hand up. Johnson waits. Two more hands go up. Johnson walks slowly across the front of the classroom, smiling, her gaze criss-crossing the class, as more and more hands spring up. Her movement, and her smile, dissipates any tension before it arises, either in herself or her students. Another lesson that Lemov learned from his football days was that if he really wanted to improve, playing in matches was not enough. He needed to practice techniques and routines, preferably with teammates. Teachers like Maggie Johnson have honed their skills outside the classroom, in countless coffee-fuelled staffroom sessions with colleagues. This means they are able to execute classroom routines with the minimum of conscious effort, leaving them free to concentrate on the headspinning complexities of tracking which child has understood what, and who needs what kind of help. The rhetoric of \u201cbad teachers\u201d and \u201cgood teachers\u201d not only reinforces the perception that teaching ability is a gift someone either has or does not have, it also undermines the kind of informal collaboration Lemov advocates (a problem with linking pay to performance is that it incentivises teachers not to help each other improve). Indeed, the set-up of most schools is inimical to collaboration. In a hangover from the days when monks taught in cells, the most important work in a traditional school is done behind closed doors, by individuals separated from their peers (educationalists call it the \u201cegg crate model\u201d). As a consequence, teachers have never developed a shared vocabulary for discussing their work in detail. One reason they enthuse over Teach Like a Champion is that it offers one. A teacher at the workshop told me: \u201cI can say to my colleagues, \u2018Have you tried cold calling? And they immediately understand what I mean. That makes a huge difference.\u201d Lemov played the video of Maggie Johnson a third time, and paused it about two-thirds of the way through. He pointed to a girl in the front row, slight and bespectacled, with her hair in neat plaits. At a point when most of the class have their hands in the air, hers is still down. Her teacher waits. The girl stares intently at her notes. Her hand creeps up to her neck, and goes down again. Her teacher is still waiting. The girl puts her hand up, this time with conviction, and this time she holds it there. Lemov is wary of big ideas and educational philosophies. Most of the tools in Teach Like a Champion, he says, remain beneath the notice of theorists of education. But he does have a philosophy, even if he wouldn\u2019t call it that. One of its tenets is that teachers need to maximise the amount of thinking and learning going on in their classroom at any one time, and to ensure that this effort is widely distributed. Take \u201ccold calling\u201d. Instead of asking a question of the class and then picking a hand, you call on a student regardless of whether they have raised their hand. It sounds too simple to be significant. But, to use one of Lemov\u2019s favourite phrases, cold calling is \u201ca small change that cascades\u201d. Cold calling enables the teacher to check on the level of learning of any student in the class; it keeps the pace of the lesson high, because the teacher no longer has to wait for volunteers; it makes the teacher look more authoritative. Crucially, it increases the amount of thinking going on in the classroom at any one time because everyone knows the next question might be for them. Another of Lemov\u2019s tenets is that mundane routines can have magical effects. He often opens his sessions by showing a clip of a teacher called Doug McCurry at Amistad Academy in New Haven, Connecticut \u2013 another school that achieves exceptional results with underprivileged students. McCurry is instructing his pupils, on their first day at school, on how to pass out papers. Though it happens several times every hour of teaching, it is not the kind of thing you get taught at training college. McCurry takes a minute to explain how he wants it done (pass across rows, start on his command, only the person passing gets out of his or her seat). Then he has his students practice it while he times them with a stopwatch. \u201cTen seconds. Pretty good. Let\u2019s see if we can get them back out in eight.\u201d When Lemov plays this clip, many teachers are sceptical. Why is McCurry focusing on this menial task? Is he trying to turn his students into automatons? Quite the opposite, says Lemov. Assume that the average class passes papers out or back 20 times a day, and that they take 80 seconds to do it. If McCurry\u2019s students accomplish this task in 20 seconds, they will save 20 minutes a day. The school has increased its most precious asset \u2013 teaching time \u2013 by 4%, without any spending any more money. In case that sounds like arid managerialism, consider what it means in practice: 20 minutes not spent passing papers back and forth is 20 minutes that a child who grew up in a home with no books can spend learning about how Charles Dickens uses imagery; 20 minutes not shuffling paper is 20 minutes that a girl who believes she is hopelessly bad at maths can be taught how to calculate the area of a circle. Over a school year, those minutes add up to eight school days: time for a whole unit on 20th-century poetry or coordinate geometry; time enough to get hooked on the life-expanding pleasures of learning difficult things. *** Gareth Cook, a slender young man with feline eyes, is watching himself, on a laptop screen, address a group of 12-year-old boys sitting on artificial grass, clutching footballs. In a crisply delivered speech, Cook, a former school teacher, explains to the children how to react when your team loses possession. When the video is paused, Cook sits back and says, \u201cToo much talking.\u201d Next to him, Martin Diggle nods, pointing to a time code under the picture: \u201c29 minutes of talking in a 90 minute session.\u201d Cook is a junior coach at the academy of Liverpool Football Club. Diggle is employed by the Football Association to mentor club coaches, part of the FA\u2019s effort to raise the technical standards of the national game. Staff at top clubs do not generally relish being told how to do their job by the sport\u2019s governing body, but Diggle, an experienced coach possessed of a reassuring manner, is listened to. \u201cMy job isn\u2019t to tell them how to coach,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy job is to help them think about what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Earlier in the day I watched Nick Marshall, the academy\u2019s head of operations, deliver an appraisal to another young coach. Topics included the importance of attending to the individual as well as the group, and how to make children want to follow rules rather than feel they have to. \u201cAs coaches, we tend to get obsessed by tactics,\u201d Marshall told me afterwards. \u201cBut instead of studying tactical diagrams until 3am, why aren\u2019t we reading Carol Dweck, or the neuroscience of the teenage brain?\u201d Just as sports coaches are becoming polymaths, teachers are adopting coaching\u2019s focus on constant, self-reflective improvement. Traditionally, teachers haven\u2019t necessarily been expected to get better at teaching once they have mastered the basics of the job. According to Dylan Wiliam, Emeritus Professor of Educational Assessment at the University of London\u2019s Institute of Education, and a former teacher, the evidence suggests that most new teachers improve for the first two to three years of their career, as they learn how to manage classroom behaviour, and then stop improving. \u201cPeople make claims about having 20 years\u2019 experience,\u201d Wiliam told me, \u201cbut they really just have one year\u2019s experience repeated 20 times.\u201d    People make claims about having 20 years\u2019 experience, but they really just have one year\u2019s experience repeated 20 times  Dylan Wiliam     For years, British football coaching was stymied by a macho disdain for new ideas imported from the European clubs that regularly beat them in competition. In education, when Asian countries top international tables of achievement, we make derisory noises about hothousing. But the reason Shanghai\u2019s schools are recognised as among the best in the world is because their teachers never stop thinking about how to get better at teaching. When Marc Tucker, the president of NCEE, an American education thinktank, went to Shanghai, he discovered a system designed to elicit continual improvement. Staff meet once a week by grade and subject, and break into teams to work on problems of their choice \u2013 at one school, the teachers had rearranged their floor plan so that teachers from the same grade level shared an office. Every young teacher has an older mentor, of proven achievement, assigned to them. The Shanghai system, Tucker said, revolves around the premise that \u201cnot only is it possible for you to get better, it is your job to get better and it never ends\u201d. Nick Marshall reminded me that there have always been forward-thinking football coaches in this country. But they are now more likely to find a home that makes the most of their talents, and to choose an employer on that basis. Similarly, ambitious teachers now want to work for a school that helps them improve, rather than one where they are so busy struggling to impose their will on the classroom that they cannot develop their skills. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed,\u201d Sam Freedman told me, \u201cat how many schools there are where a teacher can discipline a child by sending him out of the room, only for the deputy head to pass by a few minutes later and send him back in.\u201d At successful schools, everyone abides by the same rules, while at the same time understanding that the rules are a means to an end. The best instil a hunger to learn, and not just in their pupils. Introducing his workshop for educators, Doug Lemov showed a scatter graph, plotting achievement in maths, on the horizontal axis, against socioeconomic status on the vertical axis. Each dot represented a school in America. The dots clustered together into fuzzy but unmistakable line running from top-left to bottom-right: the poorer you are, the less likely you are to achieve the kind of education that might enable you to stop being poor. The same applies here: in England, if you are a high-achieving 11-year-old from a poor family, you are only 30% as likely to attend university as your richer peers. After inviting us to consider anew the enormity of this grim truth, Lemov pointed to some stray dots that had escaped from the main cluster to find their own space. In these schools, children from poor neighbourhoods were doing as well or better than middle-class peers. If they can do it, he said, why can\u2019t any school? And why isn\u2019t every other school in the land scrabbling to find out what these schools are doing right, so that they can copy it? *** Almost the first thing Jenny Thompson does when I arrive at her school on a freezing Monday morning is to take me outside. \u201cCome and stand on the step with me,\u201d she says, \u201cThis is what I do every morning.\u201d Thompson, 34, is senior vice principal at Dixons Trinity Academy, which Sam Freedman told me was the best school he had visited in England. It\u2019s early \u2013 before 8am \u2013 and night still lingers; I wonder if I should go back and get my coat. But now here come the children, some arriving alone, some in twos or threes, some grinning, some with heads down. Thompson has a word for everyone. \u201cHow are you this morning, Ahmed? Did you sleep OK, Shazia? Ben, have you recovered?\u201d Academies may not, on average, be better than regular schools, but the best ones are doing astonishing things. Shortly after he started videoing great teachers, Lemov co-founded a chain of charter schools. Uncommon Schools aims to help children born into poverty get to university. Its 40 or so schools, scattered across north-eastern cities such as Boston and New York, serve the urban poor, which means, for the most part, African-Americans. In a reversal of national norms, its black students outperform local white students in tests of maths and reading, and consistently beat state averages, often dramatically so. Lemov\u2019s workshop in London was hosted by All Saints Academy, part of the Ark chain, whose schools are achieving similarly impressive results in underprivileged areas. Dixons Trinity, which opened in 2012, draws its pupils from one of the most deprived parts of Bradford, a town yet to regain the prosperity it enjoyed in its industrial heyday. Around half of the pupils live in the city\u2019s five poorest wards. Many are the children of immigrants from Pakistan or India, and many do not speak English at home. But its students out-perform the UK average in English and maths, and the ones who enter Dixons Trinity with the lowest achievement levels do better than anyone else. This is a source of particular satisfaction to the school\u2019s principal, Luke Sparkes, who tells me that the school is designed around its most vulnerable pupils. \u201cIf you get it right with them, you get it right with everyone.\u201d     Luke Sparkes, principal at Dixons Trinity Academy in Bradford. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    It is 8am now, five minutes before the start of the school day. Children tumble out of parental cars and run. Thompson reassures them: \u201cIt\u2019s OK. You\u2019re not late!\u201d By 8.05 all the children are inside. It is an earlier start than at most schools, but the children\u2019s punctuality record \u2013 at Dixons Trinity, they keep data on everything \u2013 is almost 100%. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d Thompson says, \u201cthey want to be here on time.\u201d Doug Lemov says his techniques work best when the pupils understand when and why they are being used; they are not intended to be secret weapons. The spirit of transparency permeates Dixons Trinity. When new pupils join they are asked to sign up \u2013 literally \u2013 to the school\u2019s values of \u201chard work, trust and fairness\u201d. After that, \u201cwe over-explain everything,\u201d Thompson says. There is no rule or routine, from being silent in the corridor to lining up in the playground after lunch, that isn\u2019t painstakingly explained and re-explained to the pupils. \u201cWe have high standards, and that means rules,\u201d Sparkes says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want the kids to feel they have to kick against them, so they need to feel part of it.\u201d I watch as Dani Quinn, head of maths, teaches her class how to calculate the area under a curve. She begins with an explanation of why they are doing the lesson at all, given that they covered the same material last week: \u201cWe know from research in psychology that when your brain is forced to retrieve something from memory, it sinks in deeper.\u201d When two girls start to whisper to each other as Quinn is talking, she silences them with a swift but detailed explanation of why she is doing so: \u201cIt means the others can\u2019t hear me properly, which prevents them learning, which isn\u2019t fair on them and damages the trust we have in each other. OK, so how do we calculate this value?\u201d Sparkes, a self-possessed 35-year-old from Liverpool, was at pains to stress that most of the school\u2019s practices are adopted from other good schools. \u201cVery little of it is new,\u201d he told me, as we stood in the playground and watched two teachers line up the entire school as a post-lunch reset. \u201cThe only difference is, we do what we say.\u201d At Dixons Trinity, there is no single innovation or magical personality around which everything revolves, just a shared and relentless attention to better execution. That can make it a hard place to work. \u201cYou need a self-critical disposition to work here,\u201d said Thompson. On the other hand, there is pleasure to be found in obsessing over the details of an inexhaustibly interesting job. Dani Quinn describes herself as a \u201cpedagogy geek\u201d. On a table in Sparkes\u2019s office are copies of Teach Like a Champion. \u201cWe buy it for every teacher,\u201d he told me. At least two mornings a week, the teachers get together in a group or in paired sessions between younger and more experienced teachers. When I visited, they were focused on honing two of Lemov\u2019s techniques: \u201cno opt out\u201d \u2013 insisting, when a child gives an answer, that she repeat it until it is 100% correct, and \u201cpositive framing\u201d \u2013 making critical feedback encouraging. Small things, said Sparkes, but teaching is complex, and in the classroom, \u201cyou need to have this stuff down so that you can think\u201d. Not to mention that for pedagogy geeks, this is fun. What the teachers at Dixons Trinity tell the children, they apply to themselves: that it is vital to push yourself, that the road to mastery leads through hard work, that you should never stop trying to get better. Somehow, though, these imperatives do not sound like strictures. The school runs on rules, but it is animated by something else. In the videos that Doug Lemov shows, what impresses you is the teaching, but what moves you is the palpable joy that the students are taking in being taught. In the days after my trip to Dixons Trinity, what stayed with me was the image of Jenny Thompson, radiating bonhomie into the chill Yorkshire air, children rushing up the steps to school. Before I leave, I ask Thompson where she finds the will to get out of bed at 5am every day; to work weekends and evenings; to endure the punishing constraint of thinking self-critically about everything she does. At least in sport or business, I suggest, there are prizes. \u201cOh, but I think it\u2019s easier for us to get motivated,\u201d Thompson says, noting that she was still paid less than the salary she was offered to join Goldman Sachs as a graduate trainee. She laughs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t work this hard if I was at a private school.\u201d Ian Leslie is the author of Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Future Depends on it.

Unsurprisingly, Belgium (25), where the European council holds its meetings, is the most popular destination. The next most visited countries on Cameron\u2019s travels were France (nine) followed by Afghanistan (eight) to visit British troops.  The PM\u2019s first overseas trips were to Berlin and Paris to meet Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, and in June 2012 he became the first British prime minister to visit Norway in 26 years.      David Cameron\u2019s overseas travels - May 2010 to March 2014 (inclusive). Shows count of every time the prime minister has visited a country within the region.   In the first eight months of his prime ministership, Cameron visited 14 countries - including trips to Nato, G8 and G20 summits and Switzerland for the failed 2018 World Cup bid.  In 2011 and 2012 the number of Cameron\u2019s trips and countries visited remained fairly steady. In 2011 the PM made 25 trips, and he made 21 in 2012. In both years he visited 20 different countries (on some overseas trips the PM goes to more than one country). In 2013 he made 20 trips visiting 20 different countries. The number of times that the PM will get on a plane will naturally decline further as the election nears and the Tory leader moves his focus to the domestic front - and to an extent this is expected and justifiable.   Related: David Cameron's overseas trips: where has he visited?    However, with the number of trips made by the PM having dropped year-on-year every year since the PM entered Downing Street, it probably isn\u2019t surprising that many question if Britain\u2019s standing in the world has declined under Cameron?  Consider this: in the first two weeks of February this year the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, visited eight European countries, plus Washington to meet President Obama and Ottawa to meet the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper. The chancellor\u2019s trip included meetings in Kiev with the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, and in Moscow with Vladimir Putin. By comparison, in the first three months of 2014 David Cameron made six trips to six different countries. While it isn\u2019t surprising that most of Cameron\u2019s overseas trips were within Europe, it is quite remarkable that the PM has only visited Latin America twice - and once was to Mexico for a G20 summit. The PM has been far more active in Asia, which is his second most visited region after Europe. Recent trips in December 2013 include an overseas trade mission and bilateral meetings in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu in China. Cameron vowed in 2010 to double UK trade to the country to $100bn (\u00a362bn) a year by 2015. Other trips to Asia include visits to Pakistan and Kazakhstan in June/July 2013 as well as trips to India and Sri Lanka in November of the same year. In fact the PM has visited India on three occasions: in July 2010, February 2013 and November 2013. In terms of the special relationship, during the analysed period the PM visited the US six times, which, coincidentally, equals the number of trips he made to Germany \u2013 a relationship the PM may increasingly need if he is to successfully renegotiate terms of EU membership after the next election.

The move was seen as largely symbolic, a token action designed to head off the criticism the government expected from Prince William on his visit to China the following week. But it is a hopeful sign that the Chinese authorities are sensitive to the international outcry over the country\u2019s role in fuelling demand for poached ivory, and its complicity in the massacre of elephants currently taking place all over Africa. In response to international pressure, governments in China and Hong Kong are also taking action to destroy ivory stockpiles. By the end of June, Hong Kong will have destroyed 30 tonnes of illegal ivory \u2013 one of the largest commitments seen anywhere. However conservationists insist that the only way to smash Chinese demand for illegal ivory is by shutting down the legal domestic ivory trade, and thus depriving business to the workshops that turn smuggled ivory into consumer products. While today in Kenya you may receive a fine of KSh 20 million (\u00a3142,000) or earn life in prison for possessing a single ivory product, in China you can freely carry around a whole polished tusk. In fact 83% of middle and upper income Chinese surveyed in 2013 by National Geographic said they were planning to buy ivory products. The legal ivory trade in China is supposedly restricted to ivory from historical stockpiles that existed before the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) ban came into force in 1976, or from the one-off sale of 60 tonnes of ivory in 2008. China flatly denies it, but there is no doubt in the minds of experts and conservationists that the legal ivory trade is simply a cover for thriving black market in poached ivory. This black market fuels demand and keeps prices high, and drives the ongoing decimation of Africa\u2019s elephant populations. Most ivory smuggled into China from Africa arrives at the port of Hong Kong, which is reputed to be the world\u2019s largest market for ivory. Last month Richard Leakey and I travelled to Hong Kong to find out for ourselves what could be done to reduce the demand for ivory. Over the course of five days, we spoke to more than 3,000 people, including government officials, the media, school children, the business community and conservation charities. We gave lectures, held meetings, and I even visited ivory shops.

In fact they sat in silence and listened carefully. Unlike pupils at other schools we visited, these 15-year-old boys did not cry or express horror at seeing pictures of dead elephants. But when they saw a bonfire of ivory they all screamed in shock. At the end, when I invited the boys to help us with solutions, they were very shy about speaking up in English. But afterwards a boy came to me and made a suggestion I had never heard before. He told me that ivory is coveted in China because of its whiteness: the whiter it is, the more valuable it is. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we stain it and make it ugly?\u201d he suggested. This would help prevent government stockpiles from ending up in the traffickers\u2019 hands. He had no idea how this could be done but was ready to go and figure it out. This wild out-of-the-box thinking is the magic of young people and why I love speaking to them. With young people on our side we will find ways to be beat the traffickers.     Paula Kahumbu with school children in Hong Kong in February 2015 Photograph: Paula Kahumbu / WildlifeDirect    But right now, the scale of the problem is huge, and unfathomable. According to Alex Hofford of Wild Aid, 25.3 million containers enter Hong Kong seaport annually, and only 1% of these are checked. 47 million tourists from China visited Hong Kong in 2014. For many of these visitors, the main purpose of their trip is shopping for luxury goods, including ivory. Despite aggressive awareness campaigns, the trade in ivory is booming. Legal ivory products, i.e. antiques, are supposed to be authenticated by certificates issued by CITES. Reports suggest that forging of these certificates makes it impossible for consumers to distinguish legal from illegal ivory. I went to two ivory shops to find out for myself. Richard Leakey would not accompany me as he said it would depress him. The shelves in the shops were stacked with small and medium carvings, jewellery and cheaply made figurines. In one shop, I found carvings of African women, clearly from Africa. The shop assistant confirmed that the sculptures were produced in Africa, and that he had imported them from London. He had a CITES certificate verifying that he imported the pieces in December 2014 and that the sculptures were pre-1920, which would make them pre-convention and perfectly legal. I feigned deep interest in a carving made by my ancestors, and offered to buy it to take it back to London. He was aghast and warned me that I could not take it out of Hong Kong despite the \u2018official\u2019 CITES permit. My personal assessment was that the carving was more likely from recent ivory. I suspected the same of many of the raw tusks and other carvings in his shop. These were not works of ancient art; they were not even beautiful. These were mass produced pieces including jewellery, carvings of Buddhist and Christian religious icons and, ironically, miniature elephants. I asked if I could buy earrings or chopsticks as gifts for friends, saying that I would hide them in my suitcase and smuggle them into London. Again the trader aggressively warned me against it and said I would get caught and arrested. When I asked what the penalty would be, he said he had no idea. The government officials we met were polite, extremely serious, and a pleasure to talk to. But we were surprised to hear that many of them knew virtually nothing about the role that Hong Kong plays in the international ivory trafficking and slaughter of elephants in Africa. Once they understood the problem, they were keen to help. In one meeting, a Hong Kong official asked Dr Leakey: \u201cWhat can we do to move the Hong Kong Government to ban ivory trade? How can we move the people to support it?\u201d Leakey responded that it is all about changing attitudes. When we left Kenya, we had been told that reducing the demand for ivory in China and Hong Kong would be nigh impossible due to its strong cultural roots. The culture is strong, but that does not mean it cannot change. China has abandoned many cultural beliefs and attitudes, for example towards slavery, foot binding and the rights of women. Japanese attitudes towards ivory were changed in the 1980s as the country became more integrated into the international community, and the same can happen in China. Dr Leakey is convinced that he can help fast-track this attitude change through the voice of Brad Pitt, who will be playing him in the bio epic \u2018Africa\u2019, to be directed by Angelina Jolie and due to be released in 2016. According to Leakey, \u201cThe film can change behaviour because it shows a love affair with elephants. It will allow Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to say what needs to be said and to influence hundreds of millions of people. In buying ivory, the Chinese people may not be directly killing elephants, but by not buying ivory they can directly help to stop the killing.\u201d The film will also give African conservationists the opportunity to build links with the growing environmental movement in China, to create grassroots alliances that can keep up the pressure on the government once memory of the film fades. We were well received everywhere we went in Hong Kong, as were my colleagues Christopher Kiarie and Resson Kantai on their visit to mainland China last year.

As a fledgling editor of a tennis magazine after he had retired in 2008, Bjorkman interviewed the American player James Blake, who had recently been voted one of the sexiest men in the game. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold back and not ask about his charm with the girls,\u201d Bjorkman recalled in an interview with the ATP website. \u201cUnfortunately in the story we referenced his girlfriend and ran a picture of his ex-girlfriend. I showed him the spread [later]. He joked that he\u2019ll never do an interview with me again, but he took it OK.\u201d Murray knows the feeling. After Great Britain had beaten the United States in their Davis Cup tie in Glasgow on Sunday, he mentioned in a live television interview that Dominic Inglot had met \u201ca little girlfriend\u201d over the weekend \u2013 oblivious to the fact his team-mate had recently started a relationship. That should be an ice-breaker, then, when Murray and Bjorkman meet later this month to discuss the Swede joining the team to help out during those weeks when Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo is away. However, it is unlikely Bjorkman will stray far from his home in Monaco, where he has lived for several years with his wife, Petra, and two young children. When he quit the Tour, he admitted: \u201cThe travelling is the [one thing] that\u2019s been the toughest in the end.\u201d Bjorkman is remembered kindly as a generous and funny companion on tour, and was renowned as a locker-room joker and impressionist who enjoyed a good time away from the court. So he should get on well with Murray, whose sense of humour swings between the cruel and the crazy. Although he is teetotal, Murray will appreciate the story of when Bjorkman famously played a Davis Cup dead rubber with a hangover. In Argentina in 2006, the local crowd gave the visitors a torrid time and the Swedes, 3-0 down going into the final Sunday, were not keen to play on in such a hostile atmosphere. In an interview with Cafe magazine, Bjorkman revealed: \u201cThe crowd, egged on by [Diego] Maradona, were terrible. It was a scandal.\u201d Rebellious and angry, the Swedish players, captained by Mats Wilander, indulged in several rounds of drinks on the Saturday night, determined to pull out and return home, but they were told they had to go through with the rest of the tie. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a few beers the evening before and not all [of the alcohol] was gone,\u201d Bjorkman later told the Swedish paper Expressen of how he felt on Sunday morning \u2013 although he was not, apparently, \u201ctotally out of it\u201d. Never the less, he lost the final match 6-0, 6-1 to Jos\u00e9 Acasuso. Acasuso could be proud of that scalp, however diminished its legitimacy, because Bjorkman was playing some of his best singles in his mid-thirties, making the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2006 and 2007, as well as the fourth round at Roland Garros. But doubles, where he won nine majors and was No1 in the world, was his strength. That is the expertise he will bring to the Murray project, with touch, balance and judgment at the net. Bjorkman has stayed in touch with tennis, mainly at the grassroots, where he coaches through his clinic in Stockholm. Now he is catapulted back on to the Tour, and it will be fascinating to see how he gels with Murray and Mauresmo. Word is they have already hit it off well. Bjorkman said after his last match, at the Masters Cup in Shanghai in 2008: \u201cIt started as my hobby, and I\u2019ve been able to do it for 17 years, which is great. To listen to all the trash talk in the locker rooms will be something that I will miss.\u201d Even back then, Bjorkman rated Murray, describing him as \u201cthe new prince\u201d chasing Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, \u201cfour guys competing on \u2026 a different level to the rest of the group. The way they play, it is different, with a different pace.

Lu has left her five-year-old daughter, her husband and her job as a primary school teacher in Shanghai to come to England to teach children maths \u2013 the Chinese way. The classroom has been reconfigured to resemble a Shanghai classroom. The carpet has been taken up, desks which are normally clustered in friendly groups are in straight rows, and all eyes are on Lu and her touchscreen. She is one of 30 Shanghai teachers currently working in primary schools across England, flown in by the Department for Education in the hope they can work their mathematical magic on a generation of children and raise flagging standards. Shanghai is one of the the top-performing jurisdictions in the Pisa global education league tables, which suggest that by the age of 15, children in Shanghai are up to three years ahead of their English peers in maths. Almost all Shanghai pupils reach a similarly high standard and there are few gaps in achievement (unlike in England where there is a wide range in attainment). Lu and her colleagues are here to show us how they achieve their extraordinary results. The government has invested \u00a311m in a two-year programme to boost England\u2019s performance in maths, but many in the education world remain sceptical about attempts to copy the Shanghai model.   Related: \u2018Culture, not just curriculum\u2019, determines east Asian school success    Fractions are apparently particularly challenging for English children, so Lu is devoting her three-week stay at Fox primary school in Kensington to halves, thirds, numerators and denominators. It may be worth noting that the children at Fox are already pretty good at maths. Fox is one of the best performing primary schools in the country, but 25 other schools currently have their own Miss Lu, 22 schools were part of a similar programme last November, and the aim is that good practice will be shared with other schools. To that end, at the rear of the classroom sits a small group of observers \u2013 teachers from nearby schools \u2013 who watch and take notes. Next year the Shanghai exchange expands to secondary schools. Lu begins by asking the children to read out the fractions on the screen. One child gives the answer \u2013 \u201ca half\u201d \u2013 then the rest of the children repeat. Another child identifies a third, everyone repeats, a quarter, and so on. At the end of this part of the lesson the children give themselves a clap \u2013 not a boisterous round of applause with whoops and cheers, but five precise claps in a set rhythm. Then the children read the fractions out all over again before Lu moves on to how to write fractions. There is nothing random about how to write a fraction, it turns out. First you draw the line, then you write the denominator (below the line), and finally the numerator, above the line. In that order. \u201cCan you write the fractions now? Yes or no?\u201d she asks the children. The children write them in their books then are called out individually to the front to write them on the board. Five more tidy claps. The class is repetitive, going over and over similar territory, stretching the children slightly further as the lesson progresses, picking up on mistakes and making sure that everyone is keeping up.  This is the \u201cShanghai mastery approach\u201d, a methodical curriculum, aimed at developing and embedding a fluency, deep knowledge and understanding of underlying mathematical concepts.     In Shanghai every child of the same age is on the same page of the same text book at the same time. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris/Frantzesco Kangaris for The Guardian    \u201cEnglish teachers would have moved on so much more quickly,\u201d whispers Ben McMullen, deputy head at Fox school and senior lead in the local maths hub. \u201cThey dwell on it for what seems a long time so every single child understands exactly what\u2019s going on. We move them on too quickly before they\u2019ve properly understood the principle.\u201d Lu is now asking the children what a fraction is. \u201cIf the whole is divided in to three equal parts, each part is a third of the whole,\u201d one child explains. The other children follow suit, repeating and adapting their answer to explain the fraction written on the board. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chanting and recitation which to our English ears seems a bit formulaic,\u201d says McMullen, \u201cbut it\u2019s a way of embedding that understanding.\u201d    There\u2019s a lot of chanting and recitation which to our English ears seems a bit formulaic  Ben McMullen, deputy head     Last September McMullen was one of 71 English teachers to travel to Shanghai where they spent two weeks in local primary schools and he is still brimming with enthusiasm at the quality of the maths teaching he saw there. To start with the lessons are much shorter \u2013 35 minutes in Shanghai followed by 15 minutes unstructured play, half what McMullen usually delivers at Fox. \u201cI saw better maths teaching in 35 minutes than I had ever done in an hour and ten minutes,\u201d he says.  In Shanghai every child of the same age is on the same page of the same text book at the same time. Setting and streaming do not exist - there\u2019s an expectation that every child will succeed. Children have mastered their jiujiu (times tables) back to front and inside out by the time they are eight. Classrooms are bare and text books are basic, minimal, \u201cnot that appealing\u201d to look at, admits McMullen, but of exceptionally high quality and thoroughly researched. The classroom where we are sitting, in contrast, is filled with colourful, interesting work stuck all over the walls; one display shows the word of the day is \u201cShanghai\u201d, the word of the week is \u201cChina\u201d, an untidy row of violins lean up against the wall and children come and go to music lessons. Perhaps our children are suffering from sensory overload, ponders McMullen.     Some are sceptical about importing Shanghai teaching techniques to England. Photograph: Alamy    When Lu is working at her usual school, Shanghai Zhaibei District Experimental Primary, she teaches just two lessons a day; she only teaches maths, the rest of the day is spent debriefing and discussing maths. An English primary teacher, in contrast, is a generalist, teaching all subjects, all of the time. Likewise, the teacher training models for China and England could hardly be more different. Lu spent five years at university studying primary maths teaching; trainee teachers on programmes like School Direct will spend less than two weeks concentrating on maths. Ruth Merttens, professor of primary education at the University of St Mark and St John, is one of those who is sceptical about importing Shanghai teaching techniques to England.  She questions how compatible Shanghai methods are with the diversity of children in English schools, which cater for children of many different nationalities and backgrounds, as opposed to the more homogeneous intake in Shanghai. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can learn from the Shanghai teachers, some things will be appropriate, others will not. But one thing I would say is that there\u2019s very little money in education at the moment.

English \u201csuper teachers\u201d can only dream of teaching two lessons a day, with the rest of the day devoted to professional development in their specialism. Contrast this with the box-ticking mentality peddled by politicians, which gives teachers no time to reflect on their pedagogical development.

When we look at the quality of teaching in the Netherlands, Singapore, Flemish Belgium, Japan and Finland, why are we copying this nonsense? Yes, whole-class teaching is a key feature of effective teaching, but what happened to the vital component called interaction? When you look at effective mathematics teaching across the globe there is a huge variation but direct teaching based on conceptual understanding and students making sense of mathematics is a common feature. Countries that provide a balance between conceptual understanding and computational proficiency are successful. Looking at the research into children\u2019s understanding of fractions, we see the negative impact of teaching ungrounded symbolic manipulation and learning of an isolated vocabulary. Giving teachers more time to prepare and having high expectations of their lessons does seem to be a feature of highly effective countries but I suspect the investment is costly. Yes, some countries have specialist mathematics teachers in primary but it is not a feature that is common to the highest-achieving ones. Success is actually rather straightforward: stop chopping and changing, keep developing interactive teaching, invest in supporting the teachers to do this and do not expect overnight gains.Frank EadeGrand Cayman, Cayman Islands \u2022 Let\u2019s all follow the example of the Shanghai education system? True, it has invested huge amounts of money, and teachers have time to prepare good lessons. However, a city of 23 million should be educating 300,000 15-year-olds. Shanghai lavishes money only on those 100,000 whose parents hold residency permits. Children whose parents don\u2019t possess a hukou residency permit are unable to access the education system (Report, 31 July 2104). With after-school crammer clubs, the school day can last up to 12 hours. Maths, literacy and science are taught to the exclusion of other subjects. Child wellbeing and health are among the lowest in the developed world, with depression and suicide rates way above European countries. Is this a model we want to follow?Richard KnightsLiverpool    Whenever I hear someone being critical of chanting, I want to ask them how they learned their alphabet  Chris Coghill     \u2022 Several years ago, I would help my daughters with their maths homework. It was painfully obvious that they had not grasped fundamentals to enable them to solve the questions. Once I ran over these basic elements a few times, they were able to answer easily. Clearly, the teachers had allowed the lessons to finish without ensuring all pupils had understood the basics. And now we have enlisted Chinese teachers whose mantra is to ensure all pupils understand before moving on to the next topic. Am I missing something here? Paul GarrodSouthsea, Hampshire  \u2022 The arrangement of desks (actually, usually tables) and children in English schools varies depending on the teaching format of the particular lesson. So if, as in this case, the teacher were teaching from the front, we would expect to see all children facing that way. Ben McMullen is quoted as saying: \u201cI saw better maths teaching in 35 minutes that I have ever done in 1 hour and 10 minutes.\u201d Well, I\u2019m not surprised. Lessons for seven-to-eight-year-olds should never be more than 45 minutes; even for 11-year-olds 60 minutes is the maximum; research has shown that young children cannot concentrate for longer. The Shanghai model, as I understand it, takes results from selective schools, not all schools. So results will be high and in those schools it may be possible to keep children together on the same page. We, however, have classes containing children with a wide range of ability. I can imagine the uproar if our brighter children were held back until all children were ready to move on. Teaching for understanding is crucial: repetitive copying and chanting on its own will not achieve this. The ability to write a fraction does not mean a child understands what a fraction is.Jane Cooper Former primary mathematics adviser, Isle of Wight \u2022 \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chanting and recitation, which to our ears seems a bit formulaic\u201d?

This week, however, a very public argument, has clouded this vision.  It\u2019s no surprise that the row between Dolce and Gabbana and Elton John has proved irresistible to the media, given that it involves two delicious concepts: celebrities openly expressing anger and fashion people being imprudent. To recap: Elton John called for a boycott of Dolce &amp; Gabbana after the pair described babies born through IVF as \u201csynthetic\u201d in a magazine interview. A Twitter spat ensued, with two of the designers\u2019 most famous friends and muses, Victoria Beckham and Madonna, speaking out in support of IVF.  As the storm gathered pace, Dolce and Gabbana released statements speaking of democracy and freedom of speech, with Domenico telling CNN in an interview: \u201cIt\u2019s my private point of view. I am Sicilian, I grew up in Sicily, my family is a family company and I believe in the tradition of family.\u201d      Human rights activist Peter Tatchell joins protests outside the Dolce &amp; Gabbana shop on Bond Street in London. Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images    This is far from the first time Dolce and Gabbana have found themselves at the centre of a media storm since they met. Notably, for the better part of the past decade the designers have been embroiled in a complex tax dispute, which stems from a 2004 transfer of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana and D&amp;G brands to a Luxembourg-based holding company. Though they have always vociferously protested their innocence \u2013 in July 2013 the designers closed their Milan stores and put signs reading \u201cClosed for indignation\u201d in the window \u2013 it has taken seven long years for the Italian government to agree, during which time they were given suspended sentences of 18 months in prison, fined \u20ac400m (\u00a3289m) and then, in October, cleared, with the previous charges annulled.  Dolce and Gabbana met in Milan, in 1980. Dolce grew up in the small Sicilian town of Polizzi Generosa, near Palermo, and was a tailor\u2019s son \u2013 he claims he made his first pair of trousers at six years old. He moved to the heart of Italian fashion, Milan, in his late teens, worked in the atelier of a designer called Giorgio Correggiari and there met graphic design student Gabbana, who was keen to break into fashion. Gradually, while working together, they fell in love and in 1982 set up their own label, which, Gabbana was to convince Dolce, should look to Sicily for its inspiration. \u201cAt the beginning,\u201d Dolce has said, \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to consider it because I had moved to Milan to get away from that world, to breathe a new air. Instead, I found myself designing pieces that are the cornerstones of Sicilian style: pinstriped or velvet suits, coats, waistcoats, white shirts and the flat cap known as the coppola.\u201d     Friends of the designers, Linda Evangelista, left, and Naomi Campbell backstage at a Dolce &amp; Gabbana show in Milan. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Their first shows was held in a small apartment in Milan, with Dolce\u2019s brother and sister on the door, but in 1985 they secured a spot for up-and-coming talent on the official Milan fashion week schedule. They turned heads immediately, their curve-celebrating corsetry quite at odds with the reserved, traditional approach of Italian fashion at the time, led by Giorgio Armani. Their rise to the top was helped by some powerful fans: Linda Evangelista so loved their work that she convinced her supermodel friends \u2013 Cindy Crawford, Carla Bruni, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell \u2013 to walk for them in 1992 in exchange for free clothes. Madonna spotted them around them same time, and commissioned them to design her Girlie Show tour wardrobe in 1993.  Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s romantic relationship ended in around 2001, although they did not reveal it to the press until 2005. \u201cThe worst time for us was when we broke up but kept working together,\u201d Gabbana said in 2012. \u201cWe thought about splitting up, but no. And the truth is, everything is exactly the same. But no sex.\u201d  Though the pair famously bicker (\u201cHe said, \u2018Brocade.\u2019 I said, \u2018No. Fuck brocade\u2019\u201d might be a typical exchange, according to Gabbana) a truce has been reached and now they work as a unit. Dolce, now 56, is regarded as the quieter and more introverted of the two, focusing more on tailoring, often described by journalists as having a monk-like air (this may have as much to do with his bald head and comparatively stocky stature as his demeanour). Gabbana, 52, speaks better English and is credited with the label\u2019s patterns and colours. Not only do they work together but they live on different floors of the same apartment block and even go on holiday together \u2013 current boyfriends in tow.     The worst time was when we broke up but kept working together. The truth is, everything is exactly the same. But no sex  Stefano Gabbana     \u201cI can\u2019t work without him,\u201d Gabbana once said in an interview. \u201cMaybe one day there will be a Dolce collection and a Gabbana collection \u2026 \u201d \u201cNo. Never,\u201d retorted Dolce. \u201cThis is my destiny.\u201d Certainly, the pair are inextricably linked as a megabrand, producing womenswear and menswear, and there are fragrances, sunglasses, jewellery, childrenswear and beauty products, with revenues of \u20ac759.34m in the last financial year. In 2013 the businessmen were named on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with Dolce\u2019s net worth estimated at $2.2bn (\u00a31.5bn) and Gabbana\u2019s at $2.1bn.  At one of the tax trials, in 2013, the company\u2019s board director Cristiana Ruella talked about the various offers that were on the table for Dolce &amp; Gabbana in the 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 from LVMH and Gucci, before the latter was owned by Kering \u2013 and confirmed that a public offering had also being considered.

Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    For the moment the company is private \u2013 in all senses of the word. Loyalty is prized in Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s gilded world and there is a sense that anyone who wishes to inhabit it must tread carefully. They are unafraid of spats: in 2009 they fell out with the godfather of Italian fashion, Giorgio Armani, after the elder designer accused the relative upstarts of copying his designs for quilted trousers. Last year, they broke ranks by describing Beckham as not being on the level of the likes of Alexander McQueen. \u201cShe make a good job but \u2026 for us, she don\u2019t make the same way like a fashion designer,\u201d said Gabbana. Fashion journalists \u2013 even those from the industry\u2019s most powerful publications \u2013 have found themselves uninvited to shows after less than effusive reviews. Most senior staff have been with the company for more than two decades. Dolce &amp; Gabbana is a family and a way of life; the company\u2019s CEO is Dolce\u2019s brother, Alfonso Dolce. Fashion editors and former employees are wary of talking in public about them. Off the record, some fashion editors believe the tax debacle has proved very frustrating \u2013 one said they \u201chave stopped caring what the wider world thinks of them and have gone slightly rogue\u201d. The row this week may have caused damage, says PR and brand commentator Mark Borkowski. \u201cNowadays the level of noise around supposed \u2018crises\u2019 can make issues look a lot more serious than they are, but I did think this was a very silly, ill-thought out comment. As a fashion brand, you are selling to the high street and to high-end \u2013 you have to protect the top end of your brand so you can sell other items at the lower end \u2013 so offending your key market and key fans, icons of fashion and a patrician of gay culture in Elton John, presents a disrupted point of view in PR terms. You are repelling not only customers but people with real influence. Much of middle America or middle England would not have been too uncomfortable with their point of view but that is not their key audience.\u201d Meanwhile, Richard Storer, managing director at branding consultants Eleventen, said: \u201cTheir brand is very traditional and their adverts show groups of people, families and so on, together and rejoicing, maybe this traditional outlook is how they think life should be lived. However, this is not what the brand has always stood for in the past, so it\u2019s mixed messaging and confusing to a consumer.\u201d      A pregnant model on the catwalk for Dolce &amp; Gabbana women\u2019s autumn-winter 2015-16 collection. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP     Melanie Rickey, a fashion editor and consultant, who has a child with TV presenter Mary Portas through IVF, said Dolce and Gabbana were entitled to their views but \u201cthey need to accept there are many other ways to achieve a happy family than the one they cherish\u201d, though added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it will damage the brand. Their clothes have Sicilian Italian glamour at the core of the DNA always. And it sells.\u201d They certainly don\u2019t care for the whims of the fashion industry, returning to the curve-clinging shapes their customers love each season rather than following industry trends. \u201cWhen we design a dress, we try to imagine whether a man will whistle at the women who buys it when she wears it,\u201d Gabbana has said. \u201cIf he will, it\u2019s OK.\u201d Indeed, any angst that has been felt in the past seven years of courtroom drama has not been reflected on the catwalk.  Dolce &amp; Gabbana\u2019s fashion shows have remained cheerful and sumptuous, focusing on the themes that made them famous: an idealised version of Italian life based around family, food and femininity, often referred to clearly and playfully as earrings fashioned after pieces of pasta or, in the most recent show, mothers and babies on the catwalk. Backstage, Gabbana \u2013 the more gregarious of the two \u2013 will talk about fashion as fantasy, last season explaining his vision thus: \u201cI have this life \u2026 I want to be happy. I want to eat tomatoes and pasta. I want to have passion.\u201d Conversation will often turn to Italian cinema (Luchino Visconti\u2019s lush 1963 version of The Leopard, starring the raven-haired Claudia Cardinale, is a recurring reference) and great Italian beauties (Monica Bellucci is often in the front row). Catholicism is a common theme. The brand\u2019s most famous material is black lace, inspired by Sicilian widow\u2019s weeds, but the Dolce &amp; Gabbana woman is both a mamma and a vamp. Corsetry is a key part of the look, and dresses and tailored suits are cut very close to the curves. Yes, there are crucifixes, but they are likely to be dangling lasciviously between pushed-up breasts.While Dolce has claimed his sexuality has been unproblematic in Catholic Italy \u2013 \u201cNever,\u201d he has said, \u201cThe fashion industry is full of gays\u201d \u2013 Gabbana has talked about having 10 years of therapy dealing with issues that \u201cwere rooted in my realising that I was gay when I was a little boy.\u201d The pair have long venerated heterosexual families. In 2006, Gabbana revealed he had asked a female friend to be a surrogate mother to his children but had changed his mind: \u201cI am opposed to the idea of a child growing up with two gay parents. A child needs a mother and a father. I could not imagine my childhood without my mother. I also believe that it is cruel to take a baby away from its mother.\u201d In a 2005 Vanity Fair interview on the subject, Dolce said he would love an \u201centire football team\u201d of children, but: \u201cI have the small handicap of being gay so having a child is not possible for me.\u201d They refer constantly to their business as their baby. Their dream, they have often said, is to be a \u201cmaison, like Chanel. But maybe we need to die first.\u201d   Related: Could Elton\u2019s dust-up with Dolce &amp; Gabbana be fashion\u2019s Franz Ferdinand moment?

Faculty members feel disenfranchised and underpaid, and the institution\u2019s expansion plans have upset both academics and neighbours. Hamilton isn\u2019t a stranger to difficult situations. When he joined Oxford University as vice-chancellor in 2009, the institution wasn\u2019t in an entirely happy state. Dons were still dusting off their gowns after a prolonged and bitter dispute with Hamilton\u2019s predecessor concerning reforms to the university\u2019s governance. Hamilton was also tasked with navigating Oxford through a series of dramatic reforms to higher education, which included substantial cuts to government funding. Sally Mapstone, pro-vice-chancellor for personnel and equality at Oxford University, says Hamilton has done a good job at engaging with academics and getting them on board. She describes Hamilton as \u201ca friendly person, an extrovert, loquacious \u2013 but in the nicest possible way\u201d.  Although Hamilton\u2019s speeches sometimes overrun \u2013 Mapstone often positions herself so that she can give a subtle \u201cwind it up\u201d signal on such ocassions \u2013 he is willing to listening to others.  When Hamilton moved to Oxford from Yale University, where he was provost, he brought an American style with him, she adds. \u201cHe has a tendency is to \u2018reach out to people\u2019, which, when he first arrived, some of us found that slightly unnatural because it was an American idiom that we weren\u2019t used to,\u201d she says. \u201cActually, that kind of inclusiveness is refreshing.\u201d   Related: The Guardian profile: Professor Andrew Hamilton    Academics at New York University will be relieved that their incoming president will pay attention to staff concerns. Many feel their opinions have not been heard by the current president, and in 2013, faculty at five of NYU\u2019s schools passed votes of no confidence in Sexton. Hamilton will also face another of Sexton\u2019s unpopular legacies: the university\u2019s expansion both overseas and at home. NYU\u2019s intake has soared over recent years, making it one of the largest private nonprofit universities in the US.  Some see the institution, which has opened branches in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai and has 11 study centers around the world, as a trailblazer for US universities. But others have raised concerns about academic freedom on overseas campuses. Last weekend, the New York Times reported that an NYU professor had been barred from the United Arab Emirates after criticising the exploitation of migrant workers there. The university had said it was committed to fair work conditions of labourers in United Arab Emirates, after reports emerged that those working on its Abu Dhabi campus were underpaid, poorly treated and threatened with deportation if they protested.  NYU\u2019s expansion locally has also met with opposition. The university is currently embroiled in a court battle against opponents of $6bn expansion plan in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village. Hamilton isn\u2019t new to the US higher education system, or its culture. Each of his three children live in the US \u2013 New York, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. A keen sportsman, he once described himself as the \u201cMichael Owen of Southern Connecticut\u201d. Born in England, the world-renowned chemist studied at the University of Exeter before gaining a master\u2019s degree from the University of British Columbia and a doctorate from the University of Cambridge. It was at Princeton University that he began his academic career as an assistant professor of chemistry, before joining the University of Pittsburgh and, later, Yale University as provost.  But despite his experience living in the US, the new job will be a far stretch from Oxford\u2019s cloisters and grand dining halls. NYU is a gritty, urban university with ambitious plans and a rising reputation.  Oxford, which has a medieval governance structure including a 4,000-strong \u201cparliament of dons\u201d and a powerful council, is a prestigious but far less nimble institution. It also has half the number of students. \u201cAs vice-chancellor of Oxford, your first job is maintaining and protecting the university\u2019s reputation,\u201d says Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Eduction Policy Institute in London. \u201cNYU is another world-class institution, but it is still climbing the rankings, so the task is perhaps a little different.\u201d Raghu Sundaram, who was involved in the selection process and is professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, adds that the institution is a \u201cvery large and very complex organization that has been on a remarkable upward trajectory over the past two decades. \u201cThe biggest challenge coming out of this for the new president will be meeting the intense expectations that have been generated.\u201d  That means improving the quality of the faculty, and of the education offered to students. Doing so will require money \u2013 and NYU doesn\u2019t have much. \u201cGiven its extremely modest endowment, especially relative to its ambitions, fundraising will be of paramount importance,\u201d says Sundaram. Hamilton was chosen with this in mind. He has been key to driving his university\u2019s Oxford Thinking campaign, which has now raised more than \u00a31.9bn \u2013 an impressive amount for an institution in the UK, where there is not a strong culture of alumni donations. Hamilton has faced criticism in the UK for his \u00a3442,000 salary (including benefits and pension). Many were angered by his suggestion that universities should be allowed to raise fees above \u00a39,000 a year, where they are currently capped. It is likely he will be paid far more at NYU, and face pressure to tackle the spiralling cost of degrees in the US. But Mapstone says that Hamilton has done lots to ensure there is a generous bursary system available to people from disadvantaged backgrounds. He has also protected Oxford\u2019s reputation for high-quality research, with the university performing at the top of the UK government\u2019s research audits.  Hamilton\u2019s own research interests lie at the intersection of organic and biological chemistry. But he admits that he was a late developer, saying he had no interest in chemistry sets as a child. It wasn\u2019t until the final year of university that he realised \u201cthe beauty of organic transformations\u201d. Since then, Hamilton has always maintained an active research profile, even while vice-chancellor of Oxford. It\u2019s likely he\u2019ll continue to do so at NYU: he once said research \u201chelps me keep my sanity in the complex world of university administration\u201d.

The McLaren driver, who missed the opening race in Australia a week ago after suffering concussion in testing in Barcelona last month, will be tested by three FIA-appointed specialists at the University of Cambridge. However, that is the first of three hurdles the Spaniard will have to clear before he can race. If the trio of medical experts pass Alonso fit to travel from his Dubai home to Malaysia for the race, he will then be asked to pass the scrutiny of two further examiners. On Thursday, he will have to meet the chief medical officer of the Sepang International Circuit and the medical delegate of the FIA, Jean-Charles Piette. They will require him to pass the FIA\u2019s impact test, a 40-minute examination that will analyse his suitability to race by comparing his reactions and cognitive skills with his score taken from an earlier test. McLaren are anxious that their \u00a325m signing for the season will be fit to race after a wretchedly disappointing first outing in Melbourne, where their lone finisher, Jenson Button, came last. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Alonso\u2019s non-appearance in Australia has cost insurers \u20ac1.8m (\u00a31.3m), because of a clause requiring the driver to be fit for every race. Insurers will cover the cost unless it is found that the team was responsible for the driver\u2019s absence. Meanwhile, the Observer can reveal that Mercedes offered to pay 50% of any potential loss in a vain attempt to save the German Grand Prix. The team also undertook to promote the race, in what would have resulted in a total outlay of several million euros. On Friday, the FIA World Motor Sport Council announced that the race had been dropped from the calendar because \u201cthe commercial rights holder and promoter did not reach agreement\u201d. The race was scheduled to take place at the N\u00fcrburgring on 19 July. When talks with the track\u2019s new owners broke down in the winter, it was hoped to switch the event to Hockenheim, but that, too, proved difficult. A Mercedes spokesman said: \u201cThe organisation of the race calendar and of individual events is a matter for the FIA, the commercial rights holder and the individual promoters. In principle, we do not believe it is the job of the competing teams to provide financial support for individual events and we do not\u00a0believe this is a sustainable model for the future. \u201cNevertheless, the German GP is a core race on the Formula 1 calendar and we have a significant interest in this race taking place. Mercedes-Benz has participated in discussions and offered a significant contribution to support a successful German GP, at the Hockenheimring, in 2015. This offer was, unfortunately, not accepted.\u201d So Germany, the country that gave the motor car to the world, which won both world championships last year, and which, in Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel, have the two most dominant drivers of the modern age, no longer features on the itinerary, joining other traditional venues \u2013 including France, Portugal, Argentina and San Marino \u2013 on the scrapheap. Rumours also persist about the future of Monza, which has been in operation since 1922.

The night before, the Coalition\u2019s ship had come in. The biggest swing in Australian political history had cut through Labor\u2019s western Sydney heartland, flipping seats the Liberals had \u201cnever dreamt of winning\u201d, O\u2019Farrell said. For the voters in traditional Labor territory in Granville, Smithfield, Campbelltown, and the other unlikely seats now in Liberal hands, the former premier \u2013 and minister for western Sydney \u2013 had a goal: \u201cThat people who have voted for us for the first time do understand by the next election that we have kept the faith, that we have delivered for them.\u201d As it appears increasingly likely that O\u2019Farrell\u2019s successor, Mike Baird, will be elected premier on Saturday, the spotlight shifts to contests in Sydney\u2019s west. If key seats such as Penrith, Holsworthy, Seven Hills and Drummoyne stick by Baird, the 2011 wipeout looks less a backlash against Labor excesses and more a permanent shift in the New South Wales political landscape. Bigger than Shanghai in area, with a population greater than that of South Australia, western Sydney looms large in political calculations. Insiders speak of subjecting policies to the \u201cPenrith test\u201d. Sydney\u2019s tabloid Daily Telegraph runs a \u201cFair go for the west\u201d campaign and lauds the region as \u201creal Australia\u201d. This idealisation casts its own fog. \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes commentators make, and even people in parliament, is to talk about the region as if it\u2019s this amorphous, homogenous concept,\u201d says Michelle Rowland, the Labor member for the federal seat of Greenway. \u201cAcross the region and even with my electorate you have huge demographic differences.\u201d A \u201cwestern Sydney\u201d policy such as extending light rail to Parramatta, as both parties have promised to do, would mean little to voters in Blacktown, Rowland says. \u201cThose in Blacktown refer to Parramatta as the eastern suburbs.\u201d Ethnic diversity rises and falls across the region. In areas such as Liverpool about 150 nationalities cluster together. Blacktown\u2019s most common surname is Singh. New housing estates on the city\u2019s western fringes contribute to this influx of new voters. It makes for volatile electorates, Rowland says. \u201cThe level of \u2018rusted-on-ness\u2019 in a lot of these new areas is markedly lower than other parts of Sydney. It\u2019s predominantly people who didn\u2019t grow up in the local area and probably had little engagement in the political process.\u201d One seat to watch will be Holsworthy, formerly Menai, in the city\u2019s south-west. The electorate, which takes in an army base and defence housing, was once a Liberal stronghold. The margin is still 10%, but successive redistributions have seen its boundaries migrate towards Liverpool, and towards clusters of immigrant and working-class communities. At a pre-polling booth in George Street, Liverpool, on Thursday last week, campaigners wearing oversize party T-shirts over their clothes sweltered in 30-degree heat. Ali Karnib, a Labor man in red sporting a handlebar moustache squabbled with his Liberal counterpart over debt, public transport and whether \u201cleased\u201d was another of saying \u201csold\u201d. Periodically they would switch to Arabic and discuss more prosaic matters: how\u2019s your old man? Coming to dinner on Saturday? \u201cLabor, Liberal, it\u2019s just politics,\u201d Karnib shrugged.     Labor man Ali Karnib doesn\u2019t let politics get in the way of friendship. Photograph: Julian Chung  for the Guardian    The youngest face at the booth belonged to the Labor candidate, 27-year-old Charishma Kaliyanda. Her parents arrived in Australia from India when she was four, giving her a unique perspective on the bread-and-butter work of state governments, often dismissed as mere service delivery. \u201cHaving seen my parents struggle to establish a new life in a place that they\u2019ve chosen has been incredibly eye opening and it makes you a lot more sensitive to some of the challenges that migrants face,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes people aren\u2019t aware, or aren\u2019t sensitive to the fact these services are important. And when you come from a background where you\u2019ve relied on these services and you see, daily, reasons for them to exist and be strong and well resourced, you prioritise them.\u201d Her mother stood at the entrance of the booth nearby holding a wad of how-to-vote cards. If elected, Kaliyanda will be the state\u2019s youngest MP \u2013 and probably the last still living with her parents. \u201cYou know, ethnic families,\u201d she grinned. \u201cCan\u2019t leave until you\u2019re married or move interstate.\u201d     Charishma Kaliyanda hands out leaflets on the street. Photograph:  Julian Chung  for the Guardian    Local councillors such as Tony Hadchiti, the president of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, are keen to milk perceptions of the region\u2019s importance. \u201cEveryone has woken up to western Sydney being a powerhouse,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone away from the days where western Sydney was always neglected \u2013 though we\u2019re not 100% there yet.\u201d Already the Coalition has announced the creation of a Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue (\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple: western Sydney\u2019s time has come,\u201d Baird said) and promised billions in new infrastructure, including roads and public transport to a proposed second airport at Badgerys Creek. The Baird government has completed a rail link to the city\u2019s south-west and commenced a second to the north-west. The controversial WestConnex motorway would be another artery connecting the region, the airport and the central business district. This past weekend saw an extra $300m promised for an upgrade of Campbelltown hospital. Penrith would also enjoy the benefits of the National Disability Insurance Scheme from July 2015, Baird announced, a full year earlier than the rest of the state. Labor has countered, saying that the Baird government\u2019s cuts to services have hit western Sydney particularly hard. Waiting times are up at least 30% at Westmead, Nepean and Liverpool hospitals. Labor met a 92% on-time running target for the Western Line train every year from 2008 \u2013 a feat the Coalition hasn\u2019t been able to match in its term. Unemployment also is up across the region, reaching 9.3% in the city\u2019s south-west. More jobs is the linchpin, Hadchiti says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a job where people live it means less travel time. Less travel time is less pressure on public infrastructure. It helps with educational issues because it means less time travelling and more time spent sitting with the kids doing homework. \u201cIf we get jobs right, we are going a long way.\u201d A Liberal, Hadchiti is keen to cast the 2011 election as a watershed. \u201cThe people of western Sydney four years ago said you can\u2019t take us for granted any more. We won\u2019t vote the way our parents voted. Whether you\u2019re Liberal or Labor, you\u2019re not in a safe seat any more.\u201d But the veteran political analyst Malcolm Mackerras says this is \u201coverblown\u201d. \u201cI think western Sydney has a fair number of marginal seats, and fair number of Labor seats, and there\u2019s one safe Liberal seat,\u201d he says. Despite a catastrophic swing \u2013 more than double the state\u2019s previous record \u2013 Labor still held core seats such as Auburn, Fairfield, Lakemba, Canterbury, Bankstown and Liverpool, he says. Predictions of a western Sydney rout at the 2013 federal election were similarly exaggerated. \u201cIn the end Labor held almost every seat,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is still Labor heartland.\u201d He thinks the real opportunity for the Liberals to redraw the political map was in their gains in Newcastle and the Hunter \u2013 a historic chance probably squandered by a succession of resignations in the wake of spectacular hearings at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. \u201cWhen the Liberals did well in 2011, they won a significant number of seats in western Sydney. But all of them will go back to Labor one day,\u201d Mackerras says. Most Liberal gains in the region hang on knife-edge margins, including East Hills (0.2%), Prospect (1.1%), Macquarie Fields (1.8%) and Granville (3.8%). \u201cHalf the seats will go back next Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the rest will go back when there\u2019s another Neville Wran or Bob Carr in charge of the Labor party.\u201d", "tags": ["NSW election 2015", "Australia news", "New South Wales", "New South Wales politics", "Sydney"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-23T00:34:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/24/hsbc-to-base-ringfenced-retail-banking-operation-in-birmingham", "sentences": ["In 1993, the company previously known as the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation massively expanded its UK operations by acquiring Midland Bank."], "title": "HSBC to base ringfenced retail banking operation in Birmingham", "article": "HSBC has chosen Birmingham as the headquarters for the ringfenced UK retail and commercial banking business it is setting up, in a move that will involve relocating 1,000 jobs from London.

Their itinerary includes the Gold Museum, Chinese Cemetery, Mine Tour and Sovereign Hill\u2019s recreated Goldfields Village. The tour buses never stop at Eastern Oval, the ground that over 120 years ago hosted a unique part of Australia\u2019s sporting history.  In 1854, Ballarat had become a thriving Chinese colony and many were successful veterans of the great Californian gold rush. By 1890, the town had surrendered the last of its 20 million ounces of gold, and each member of the Chinese community faced a dark night of the soul: to stay or return home.  Locked out of key union jobs, the ones who stayed integrated into the community as market gardeners, herbalists, cabinet makers and laundry managers. These first Chinese Australians were a tough, resilient and adaptable community. And they loved Australian Rules football.  In his office at Victoria University, Dr Rob Hess, a leading historian of early Australian Rules Football history, regaled me with amazing tales of Chinese small town football pioneers: Chin Kit for Ironbark in 1882, Thomas Chin Chee for Inglewood in 1895. In 1903 James Hing of Echuca Football Club became the first Chinese player to win a premiership and also became the first recorded Chinese Australian to be suspended, soundly thrashing Abe Flower of Moama after being racially vilified on the field. And, most intriguingly, the Chinese Goldfields Leagues that started in Ballarat on Friday 26 August, 1892 and soon swept across Victoria.  For the local drinkers at Ballarat\u2019s Red Lion Hotel, that Friday was a day like no other. Chinese and Europeans had come together to witness a historical spectacle: the first Chinese Australian Rules football game.  Ballarat was split by a cultural fault line \u2013 English and Cantonese, the flutter of cards and the clacking of Mahjong tiles, whiskey and rice wine, opium and tobacco, Confucius and Jesus. On this day they were united by the great Victorian game.  Golden Point, Ballarat\u2019s Chinatown, was bustling as the curious Chinese community set off from their joss houses, kitchens, market gardens and gambling dens towards Eastern Oval to watch their men play the strange colonial game.  The two Cantonese Chinese teams, the Miners and the Gardeners, assembled in their stockings in front of the Red Lion and were transported in a six-car procession that, according to the Evening Star, \u201cmoved through Ballarat on a great scale of magnificence\u201d; a sonic potpourri with Cantonese opera songs punctured by firecrackers thrown to ward off the evil spirits, all to the soundtrack of the townspeople cheering them down the dusty streets.  The newspaper reported the Chinese players had prepared for weeks and were \u201cquite enthusiastic about the matter\u201d.  The match, which kicked off at 2pm, was umpired by Mr George Lepp. Attired in silk Chinese slippers, Lepp was the first Chinese Australian Rules umpire. The Miners were captained by Quong Tart, an extraordinary historical character who straddled the east-west cultural divide with class. Today he is immortalised in bronze outside Ashfield Station in Sydney. Quong Tart spoke English with a thick Scottish accent and introduced caf\u00e9 society to Australia through his chain of teahouses. Tart was the quintessential multicultural man, comfortable in a Kilt or Chinese robes, a bagpipe player and an honorary Mandarin of the fourth degree. Philanthropist, merchant, freemason, president of the NSW Victorian Football Club, it\u2019s fitting that Quong Tart kicked off the Chinese Australian Rules tradition.

Photograph: State Library of NSW    The \u201cCelestial Football Match\u201d began with a Chinese orchestra that continued playing throughout game. Schoolchildren shouted their support to the players in freshly learnt Cantonese. One crowd highlight reported in the Ballarat Evening Star was a pitch invasion by a European spectator who took a swing at one of the Chinese players. Described as a \u201cmuscular son of the sun\u201d, the player \u201cseized the offender and soused him in mud amid applause and laughter of a large group of onlookers\u201d.  The 25-17 victory by the Gardeners over the Miners was reported nationally as a \u201csplendidly contested\u201d match in front of an estimated 5,000 fans, a pivotal moment that gave birth to the Chinese Australian Rules Football tradition.  For a golden decade, charity fundraising matches continued between the Chinese \u201cLittle Canton\u201d regional communities of Ballarat, Bendigo, Eaglehawk, Geelong and even Beechworth up in Ned Kelly Country where the Shanghai Reds played the Foochow Greens in 1896.  The Ballarat pre-game template was adopted in all of these games, which were often played with intensity; a telling anecdote comes from a game in Geelong in 1896 featuring the Gardeners, a \u201cfull-blooded\u201d Chinese team who played the Miners, a \u201chalf-caste\u201d Chinese team.  In an effort to throw the Gardeners off their game, the Miners started pulling and unravelling their opponent\u2019s Manchu pigtails causing a \u201cdisturbance\u201d between the players. \u201cThis was wrong,\u201d reported The Bulletin, \u201cbecause the half-castes should have remembered that their fathers were Chinese.\u201d     Les Kew Ming \u201cThe Fighting Footballer\u201d. Ming was one of the early Australian Rules players who were Chinese.  Photograph: North Melbourne Football Club     In 1899, football fever spread to the big city, infecting Melbourne\u2019s Chinese community. A series of Chinese community games were held to raise money for St Vincent\u2019s Hospital including the first international game of Australian Rules Football between \u201cChinese and Hindoo\u201d teams.  In 1901 the White Australia policy stopped any new Chinese immigration and those that remained faced official discrimination. Ballarat\u2019s Chinatown was demolished, the regional Chinese communities moved into Melbourne and the Goldfields Leagues ceased to exist, the only legacy being the nickname of the Golden Point Football Club, the \u201cRice Eaters\u201d. In Melbourne, Chinese players broke into elite football including Carlton\u2019s Wally Koochew, Geelong\u2019s George Tansing, St Kilda\u2019s Ernie Foo and the most famous of all, the fighting footballer, North Melbourne\u2019s Les Kew Ming.  Did the Chinese Australian Rules football tradition survive into the 21st century? Jamie Pi, an Australian Rules fanatic born in Xinjiang province, believes so. \u201cIt\u2019s booming,\u201d he said, and yet he had only heard rumours about the Ballarat Goldfields League history. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t people tell us about this?\u201d he asked.  Pi is the AFL\u2019s first Mandarin match commentator, the first China-born senior coach and is the current coach of Team China in the AFL International Cup. Pi is a founding member of the Southern Dragons Asian football club that has played in Melbourne since 2007 and tasted success in 2011 winning the Division 3 title in front of hundreds of screaming fans.  \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the AFL South China League, how fast it\u2019s growing and how seriously the students are taking it,\u201d said Pi. \u201cAFL clubs such as Port Adelaide are getting behind it and they\u2019ve now got eight teams including the Guangzhou Scorpions. The AFL has gone back to its Cantonese roots.\u201d  Last year, Pi played and coached China to their first ever win against Finland in the International Cup, an experience he describes as \u201cunbelievable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s coming slowly but surely,\u201d he said. \u201cHere in Melbourne Lin Jong from the Western Bulldogs carries the AFL flag for the Chinese community, with strong Chinese heritage. We have some good prospects in the VFL and TAC Cup pipeline such as Michael Tang from the Coburg Lions and Kenny Ong from the Sandringham Dragons.\u201d     Team China Player Coach Jamie Pi (l), Port Adelaide\u2019s Jackson Trengove, Team China captain Shaoliang Chen. Photograph: Port Adelaide Football Club     More than a century since the first Chinese Australians played footy, it\u2019s clear the tradition lives on. \u201cThese are amazing Australian stories. Chinese players lining up to play the quintessential Australian game in the shadow of the White Australia policy,\u201d said Dr. Hess. \u201cFootball was able to bring the European and Chinese communities together and created a decade of tolerance and harmony across Victoria. There\u2019s a rich history that historians have ignored, hidden or marginalised.\u201d  Pi is clearly delighted to carry on that tradition. \u201cWe\u2019ve always played the game and we\u2019ll always play it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our game too, no matter what anybody says.\u201d  With special thanks to Associate Professor Robert Hess from Victoria University, Edith Fry from the City of Ballarat and Sophie Couchman from the Chinese Museum, Melbourne.", "tags": ["AFL", "Australian rules football", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-25T03:41:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/25/accc-slaps-down-andrew-forrests-call-for-cap-on-iron-ore-production", "sentences": ["In a speech in Shanghai on Tuesday evening, Forrest expressed concern about the plunging iron ore price and suggested the major producers should \u201cact like grown-ups and just agree to cap their production\u201d."], "title": "ACCC slaps down Andrew Forrest's call for cap on iron ore production", "article": "Foreign minister Julie Bishop has backed away from earlier comments supportive of mining billionaire Andrew Forrest\u2019s call for a cap on iron ore production.

In a speech in Shanghai on Tuesday evening, Forrest expressed concern about the plunging iron ore price and suggested the major producers should \u201cact like grown-ups and just agree to cap their production\u201d. The Fortescue Metals Group chairman\u2019s remarks sparked a swift response from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which noted that \u201cthere are civil and criminal penalties for both cartel conduct and attempts to engage in cartel conduct\u201d. Bishop, when asked about Forrest\u2019s comments, told reporters: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a matter for the iron ore industry.

Bishop replied that she had made the comments in response to a question during a doorstop interview and had noted she \u201cwasn\u2019t an expert in the area\u201d. \u201cI made the quite obvious observation that the commodity price decrease is having an impact on our economy, that iron ore prices infiltrate our entire economy, but any ideas to assist would be worth considering,\u201d the deputy Liberal party leader told parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t know the detail of Andrew Forrest\u2019s proposal but I have since been discussing the matter with the treasurer and the treasurer says the specifics of Mr Forrest\u2019s proposal would not be acceptable. And of course I support the treasurer on that basis.\u201d Earlier, Hockey repudiated Forrest\u2019s idea, saying \u201cwe\u2019re not very supportive of cartels at all\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we continue to believe, as we always have, as Liberals, in free markets, and I\u2019m as concerned as the falling iron ore price as anyone else,\u201d the treasurer said. Tony Abbott said he was \u201cnot aware of Andrew\u2019s speech\u201d but was \u201cvery conscious of the fact that the iron ore price has been heading south for quite some time\u201d. \u201cWe are a trade exposed economy and we support free markets, but obviously, in a free market prices can go down as well as up and that has consequences,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cI am not going to run a commentary on the behaviour of our major producers. Obviously, they are all big enough to talk for themselves. They are more than capable of making decisions that they believe are in the best interests of their shareholders, their workforce, their customers and ultimately their country and this is the way markets operate.\u201d  Forrest raised the idea during an address to business leaders and suggested it would have flow-on benefits to the federal budget, which is affected by commodity prices. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely happy to cap my production right now,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cAll of us should cap our production now and we\u2019ll find the iron ore price will go straight back up to $70, $80, $90 and the tax revenues which that will generate will build more schools, more hospitals, more roads, more of everything which Australia needs.\u201d The ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said he would seek an explanation from Forrest because \u201cany attempt by Australian businesses to encourage competitors to restrict outputs is a matter of grave concern\u201d.", "tags": ["Andrew Forrest", "Mining", "Business", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Julie Bishop", "Bronwyn Bishop"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-25T05:01:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/mar/25/fur-trade-booming-fashion-catwalks", "sentences": ["Six months ago I would have said Beijing and Shanghai are really hot markets, but now we are seeing a shift away to the second- and third-tier cities in China as well."], "title": "Fur trade booming after swing from fashion faux pas to catwalk favourite", "article": "In 1994, four of the world\u2019s most famous supermodels were splashed across billboards under the slogan \u201cWe\u2019d rather go naked than wear fur\u201d. Fast-forward 21 years and it seems it is now another story for Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Cindy Crawford, who have been pictured in fur coats, gilets and trimmed parkas. They are not alone in falling off the anti-fur wagon. Figures from the International Fur Federation show that the industry is enjoying another year of considerable growth. The demand for mink, sable, fox and ferret has soared and farmers have stepped up production. In 2013/14, 87.2m mink pelts were produced around the world, worth a total of \u00a32.2bn, with 35m produced by China alone. China also remains one of the biggest producers of fox pelt, and together with Finland was responsible for 91% of the 7.8m fox furs produced globally. The figures \u2013 the first to show a breakdown of different pelts \u2013 follow on from research by the IFF last year which valued the global fur trade at more than \u00a326bn. On the British catwalks last year, more than 60% of shows featured fur, and at New York fashion week the figure topped 70%. While luxury labels such as Fendi have a long history of featuring real fur in their shows, fur is increasingly being used by newer brands as well. In New York, the up-and-coming label Cushnie Et Ochs said fur was its favourite material of the season, adding that it was \u201cnot ashamed\u201d. This month Karl Largerfeld said he would be putting on a special \u201ccouture fur\u201d show to mark his 50th anniversary of working for Fendi. \u201cFor me, fur is Fendi and Fendi is fur, fun furs\u201d he said. \u201cFendi is my Italian version of creativity. The Fendi haute fourrure fashion show is the opportunity to stage the royal furs of furs.\u201d He told the New York Times: \u201cFor me, as long as people eat meat and wear leather, I don\u2019t get the message. It\u2019s very easy to say no fur, no fur, no fur, but it\u2019s an industry. Who will pay for all the unemployment of the people if you suppress the industry of the fur?\u201d In the 80s it was a serious fashion faux pas to step out in real fur, but today\u2019s celebrities are rarely seen out of it. Rihanna and Rita Ora have recently been pictured in real mink coats, and Kim Kardashian dressed her one-year-old daughter North West in what was thought to be a $3,500 (\u00a32,300) crystal fox fur coat at last month\u2019s New York fashion week. Lady Gaga made a Naomi Campbell-esque turnabout on the issue. Having initially denounced fur, she was later pictured in a full-length coat made of white pelt, and went on to say: \u201cYou see a carcass, I see a museum pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\u201d Mark Oaten, CEO of the International Fur Federation, said he was unsurprised by the growth in productionas the taboo around wearing real fur was fading into irrelevance. \u201cWe knew from the catwalks that fur is certainly being used much more by designers and from some of the retail figures, which can be patchy and difficult, that the sales are going strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo with this increase in demand, farmers are deciding to invest more in fur farms and increase production.\u201d Oaten, a former Liberal Democrat MP, said Asia and Hong Kong remained the big players in the fur trade, both in terms of demand and production, but emphasised there was a shift towards buyers in America and Europe. \u201cDesigners appear to be embracing it, customers appear to be embracing it and we certainly find the younger generation have less of an issue with fur than the younger generation of the 1980s,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s changed rapidly, even in the past three or four months. We\u2019ve seen a change of patterns of the kind of consumers in Asia. Six months ago I would have said Beijing and Shanghai are really hot markets, but now we are seeing a shift away to the second- and third-tier cities in China as well. We\u2019ve also seen an enormous increase in America because fur has had an incredibly busy runway and it has also been extraordinarily cold.\u201d In the UK, members of the British Fur Trade Association reported a 20% increase in sales last year. The association\u2019s chief executive, Mike Moser, said the growth was being driven as much by younger generations as by foreign millionaires.  \u201cIt\u2019s hot stuff because fur is being used in a real fun way in fashion now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more accessible for young people because of the increase of fur trims on coats and fur accessories. \u201cThe BFTA runs an annual competition for design students using fur and this year we\u2019ve seen a 50% increase in the number of students taking art. They just want to use fur in their designs which proves there such a strong interest in the younger generation.\u201d While the fur industry in countries such as Canada, the US and Europe remains heavily regulated, concerns remain over China, which is much more lax about the welfare of animals. Oaten conceded it was a concern for the IFF and said cleaning up the Chinese fur trade remained a priority. \u201cObviously with so much mink coming from China, one of my big priorities is to make sure that they understand what the requirements are for welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in China a couple weeks ago meeting with government officials. They have already adopted Council of Europe guidelines on welfare and we\u2019ve had a long dialogue with them to implement even stronger welfare protocols. The difficulty does still lie in ensuring these regulations are always enforced in such a large country.\u201d Oaten said he was a personal fan of pelts. \u201cI use a lot of fur for interiors,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I\u2019ve not yet found a fur coat that suits me.\u201d ", "tags": ["Fashion", "Fashion industry", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-25T19:56:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/27/will-self-on-the-meaning-of-skyscrapers", "sentences": ["I accord this development \u2013 in terms of my own life at least \u2013 to be a great irony: having failed to up sticks and move somewhere exotic while I still had the necessary verve, I\u2019ve awoken in middle age to find that Shanghai is my new neighbour."], "title": "Will Self on the meaning of skyscrapers \u2013 from the Tower of Babel to the Shard", "article": "When it comes to skyscrapers I am, in the proper sense of the word, ambivalent: I hate them for all the obvious reasons \u2013 sometimes a cigar may be just a cigar, but a skyscraper is always a big swaying dick vaunting the ambitions of late capitalism to reduce the human individual to the status and the proportions of a submissive worker ant. Architecturally skyscrapers are the most meretricious of structures; predicated not on the possible realisation of any aesthetic ideal, but on the actualisation of specific construction technologies. In syllogistic lock-step with Mount Everest \u2013 which was climbed simply \u201cbecause it was there\u201d \u2013 they are there \u2026 simply because. And following on from the cast-iron frame method that allowed for the first skyscrapers to be raised in the late 19th century, each successive wave of innovation has been incorporated into further erectile capability. The current architectural zeitgeist, whereby form invariably follows finance, finds its purest expression in the skyscrapers de nos jours, with their parametrically designed waveforms that positively billow with opportunism. Yet I also love them \u2013 truly, I do. I love their Promethean swagger; I love their ability to transform our perception of the city by proposing a new parallax around which we instantly reorient as we tunnel along at ground level. And I love the way that they are seemingly purpose-built to accompany what Marshall McLuhan described as the \u201cinstantaneous medium\u201d of electricity. By day, Renzo Piano\u2019s Shard is an almost frantically undistinguished building; far from being the mirrored sliver thrust into the skyline its designer envisaged, its dirt-dappled haunches hunker down on top of London Bridge station, surely straining even the notable credulity of the City commuters who, morning and evening, gaze up at its exposed giant bolts. But by night, through the window of the bedroom where I sleep \u2013 a room into which I have moved to enjoy it \u2013 I thrill to the sight of this Orion\u2019s dagger, dropped from the jet-howling darkness to quiver and wink in the sodium-lit belly of the urban beast; and I hearken \u2013 like the good global tribalist that I am \u2013 to the message of this medium: to look upon the Shard is, perforce, to worship it.     Toby Maguire as Spiderman in Spider-Man 2. Photograph: MELISSA MOSELEY/AP    Shortly after the topping-out ceremony for the Shard, a squib appeared in Private Eye. There is a regular feature in the Eye called \u201cLookalikes\u201d that invites readers to send in two photographs that foreground a resemblance between disparate people. Usually one of the individuals will be a politician or similar worthy, and the other a popular entertainer, so the intent is obvious: to denigrate the former by association with the latter. The images are always accompanied by a reader\u2019s letter that follows a formula: \u201chas anyone else noticed the resemblance between X and Y, I wonder if by any chance they may be related?\u201d So it was that a postage stamp-sized photo of the Shard appeared, next to an equally grainy illustration of the four-pronged tower inhabited by the wizard Saruman in JRR Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings; and the reader\u2019s letter of course read: \u201chas anyone else noticed the resemblance between the Shard and Isengard, I wonder if by any chance they may be related?\u201d Setting to one side fantastical nit-picking \u2013 Isengard is the name of the entire fortress, the central tower is in fact called Orthanc \u2013 this struck me as a very funny trope indeed, and I\u2019m still laughing nearly three years later. Like all the best visual jokes, this one establishes an antinomy: perceptually the two buildings are startlingly similar, but conceptually they couldn\u2019t be further removed. Or could they? What makes the joke continue to resonate is the way the mind goes on bouncing between the two towers, delineating a complex interlacing of correspondences, until forced to the conclusion that, yes, they must indeed be related.     King Kong atop the Empire State Building (1933). Photograph: RKO/Allstar    \u2766 I am a child of two cities with markedly different edifice complexes. My mother was a New Yorker who grew up in Queens; my father, a Londoner, born in the southern suburb of Blackheath. As they were growing up in the 1920s and 30s, both would have had good long-distance views of their respective burgeoning metropolitan centres, with this key difference: until the late 60s, Wren\u2019s St Paul\u2019s Cathedral remained far and away the most salient building on the London skyline: a baroque salver cover beneath which lay church and state disjointed. London had an early flirtation with the skyscraper: Queen Anne\u2019s Mansions in Petty France, Westminster, was raised at first to 12 storeys in 1873 and a further two were added in the early 1890s. Equipped with hydraulic lifts by their enterprising developer, Henry Alers Hankey, the Mansions were at once a cynosure of the new urban lifestyle \u2013 tenants included Edward Elgar \u2013 and a focus of the most intense disapproval, not least from Queen Victoria, whose royal prerogative, she felt, included an unobstructed view of the Houses of Parliament from her back garden. The architectural historian Harold Clunn said of the Mansions, \u201cit is for real ugliness unsurpassed by any other great building in all London\u201d. The 1894 London Building Act, with its 80ft height limit, was a direct result of this genteel disapprobation; an ordinance that remained in place until it was waived in 1963 \u2013 essentially by prime ministerial fiat \u2013 so as to allow Conrad Hilton to raise his Park Lane hotel to 28 storeys. When I was a child, in the 1960s and 70s, central London remained a mostly low-rise zone, with Millbank Tower, the Shell Centre and Harry Hyams\u2019s Centre Point (designed by Richard Seifert) the notable exceptions. Whereas in the US the popular perception of the skyscraper coalesced around the \u201cinternational style\u201d office block, in Britain the field remained clear for the late arrival of Le Corbusier\u2019s machines for living: system-built structures, many prefabricated by the French engineering company Camus, that came stalking ashore in the late 1950s and early 60s. Although they were initially hailed in the spirit their planners intended \u2013 as harbingers of the new, the classless and the progressive \u2013 the collapse of Ronan Point, the 22-storey residential tower in Newham, east London, in 1968, marked a definitive break between optimistic postwar futurism and the subsequent enduring association in British popular culture of the skyscraper with high levels of social anomie. This linkage had already been welded by Anthony Burgess\u2019s 1962 dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange, with its urine-smelling and graffiti-bedizened high rises. This seems woefully unfair: Ronan Point collapsed almost certainly because of construction errors, but underlying any consideration of the practical merits of these buildings lay the deep-rooted conflict between Ebenezer Howard\u2019s bucolical \u2013 and low rise \u2013 Garden City movement and its modernist rivals; a conflict that goes back to at least the period during which Queen Anne\u2019s Mansions humped up above the horizon, when, in cultural form, it was played out in the oppositional views of the city enshrined on the one hand in the scientific romances of HG Wells, and on the other by the retro-feudal fantasising of William Morris\u2019s News from Nowhere. No Wellsian prospect of the distant future is complete without a full complement of megastructures; the author understood with deep and intuitive force that the technological extension of human capabilities would brook no opposition. An urbanism defined by the high-piling of the species was a propositional inevitability of the form: \u201cHave pile driver \u2013 will drive piles\u201d.     Illustration by Eric Petersen    The British disaffection with the high rise as an instrument of social change \u2013 up-thrusting the proletariat \u2013 led, post-Ronan Point, to a razing of these skyscrapers. To take Merseyside for example, some 80 blocks were demolished in a 20-year period from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s. For a while, in 2003-4, I had the tenancy of the highest flat in Liverpool; from the 23rd storey of this block at the back of Lime Street station, I could see as far as Mount Snowdon, 70 miles to the south. All around me extended the echoic emptiness not only of the block \u2013 that by then had fewer than 100 residents \u2013 but also the city, which had lost more than half its population since 1945. I had been allocated the apartment as part of an art project, and typing a novella on my manual machine in its gutted shell, I was conscious of acting out an adaptation of JG Ballard\u2019s High Rise (1975). This novel recasts the spatial analogue of class warfare \u2013 ingrained in the British popular imagination of the skyscraper \u2013 as an emblem for the age of evolutionary psychology. The opening line is a synecdoche: \u201cLater, as he sat on his balcony eating the dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months.\u201d The eponymous high rise \u2013 in a familiar instance of Ballard\u2019s prescience \u2013 has been built on the Isle of Dogs site soon to be occupied by One Canada Square (popularly known as Canary Wharf); the blank-faced 50-storey block designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli that became in the 1990s the concretisation of London\u2019s financial Big Bang, synonymous with the full alignment of British society with neoliberal finance capitalism \u2013 and the concomitant eastward expansion of the City of London \u2013 and which remained the tallest building in Britain until the completion of the Shard. Ballard\u2019s building is socially stratified, with the less affluent tenants on the lower floors, and the penthouse occupied by the architect-developer himself. As class warfare breaks out between lower and upper floors, and the building becomes wilfully sealed off from the surrounding city, the protagonist, Laing, embarks on a journey upwards that is less an exercise in social climbing than a phylogenetic descent from the crown of the evolutionary tree to its roots in primitivism. Hence the dog-roast.     The Shard in London. Photograph: Alamy     \u2766 Ballard understood that the role played by the skyscraper in the collective unconscious is to do with its alteration of the traditional proportions of domestic life. In this he follows L\u00e9vi-Strauss who observed that \u201call distortions in scale sacrifice the sensible in favour of the intelligible\u201d. Whether very small, as in an architect\u2019s model of a skyscraper; or very large \u2013 the skyscraper itself \u2013 the important factor is the loss of the felt experience. Of course, the actual myths that enshroud the cloudy summits of multistorey buildings are necessarily banal in secular Britain, quite as much as they are in the more plangent and religiously revanchist climate of the US. Nevertheless, Huxley when he opens Brave New World by limning the Central London Hatchery as: \u201cA squat grey building of only 34 storeys\u201d; Orwell, when he embeds the Ministry of Truth in a repurposed version of London University\u2019s Senate House (the tallest unconsecrated building in prewar central London); HG Wells, William Morris, Burgess and Ballard himself \u2013 all are operating within the unified field of the same foundational myth: that of the tower of Babel, from Genesis, a tale of human hubris: \u2026 Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another\u2019s speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth \u2026     The Tower of Babel (1563). Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images    Any and all skyscrapers are anthropic subversions of the godly perspective \u2013 attempts to realise the entirety of human life within the built environment \u2013 and hubristic affronts to our Maker and his transcendent Will, for: \u201cnow nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do\u201d. The British dichotomies \u2013 bucolic/urban, high rise/low rise; proletarian/bourgeois \u2013 all are mere spin-offs, subsumed to this primary one: our will/His; and its moral concomitant: good/evil. Naturally it follows that God\u2019s razing of the Tower of Babel recapitulates that earlier toppling from a peak perspective: Lucifer\u2019s jump, and its sequel: the apple of knowledge plummeting from a higher branch of the phylogenetic tree down into Eve and Adam\u2019s moistened mouths as they loiter between its roots. \u2766 The starts and fits with which skyscrapers were raised in the US may have been a response to boom-and-bust economic cycles, while the floor plans of the late 19th-century skyscrapers \u2013 featuring individual worker-bee cells, each equipped with its own electric lighting, window and ventilation \u2013 served a sanitary conception of social advance; the buildings\u2019 hydraulic elevators literally lifted their clerkly tenants out of disease. However, New York\u2019s 1916 Zoning Resolution \u2013 unlike London\u2019s late-Victorian stricture \u2013 imposed only formal patterning on skyscrapers, and a fixed ratio between plot size and tower footprint, rather than restricting height per se. From the top floor observatory of hindsight we can see the evolution of the set-back design of New York and then Chicago skyscrapers not as a response to the problem of human air-rights, but as the unconscious construction of a staircase fit for King Kong. True, the giant ape swarms up the facade of the Empire State Building, yet once he nears the top, he is able to hold Ann Darrow out in front of him, all the better to perform his snuffling inter-species totenlieder. In my memory Kong is always enormous, fully the equal of the man-made peak he scales. Still, every time I review the scene I am shocked by how he is dwarfed by the Empire State far more than Darrow is by him. Kong is us \u2013 or, rather, Kong is the prototypical superhuman of 20th-century myth, and at least fleetingly the skyline of Manhattan is his jungle gym. Kong was thus the way-finder for Batman, Superman, Ironman and all who followed on behind, each of whom is attempting to reapprehend the intelligible with their magically enhanced sensibilities. Indeed, flipping through back issues of Marvel and DC Comics it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the entire genre exists largely as an unconscious response to the skyscraper. Frame after frame features these limber figures leaping, back-flipping and curvetting over row after row of Mies van der Rohe; that Kong himself was a personification of the re-insemination of the machine age by the primitive necessitates his own penetration by .50 calibre machine gun bullets synchronised to fire through diaphanous aeroplane propellers.

Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    Like a window cleaner\u2019s cradle dangling from a davit in high wind, American popular culture can\u2019t help letting it all hang out. The recrudescence of the Athenian polis in the spatialisation of the Manhattan skyline \u2013 a solid block of concrete, steel and masonry neatly sliced into democratically accountable chunks \u2013 brought with it the original Grecian sin: hubris. In the film The Towering Inferno, as the fuse cupboards explode and flames wasp-waist the 135-storey tower, Doug Roberts, the architect played by Paul Newman, asks fire chief Mike O\u2019Halloran \u2013 mummed by Steve McQueen \u2013 \u201cJust how bad is it?\u201d to which O\u2019Halloran replies: \u201cDepends how good your imagination is.\u201d The answer is, of course, not terribly good at all \u2013 because it doesn\u2019t need to be. The so-called \u201cMaster of Disaster\u201d, producer Irwin Allen, ushered in the counterweight to all those Lycra-clad leapers with this 1974 film, whose release lagged not long behind the completion of the World Trade Center. Corrupt developers and their senatorial shills mill around in the Promenade Room; their celebratory party has been abandoned and now they must fight to gain access to the scenic lifts scooting down the glassy flanks of the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper. With blue-collar probity etched into every angle of his face, Chief O\u2019Halloran sneers, \u201cArchitects!\u201d To which smooth Doug Roberts can only rejoin, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s all our fault.\u201d Over the next three decades, and now in the new century, the bonfire of the vanities has never wanted for more fuel; the raising of one actual skyscraper is effectively twinned with the destruction of its cinematic doppelganger. Ballard\u2019s 1981 novel Hello America features an expedition mounted from Europe in 2114 to visit the ecologically ravaged remains of the former superpower; and which rediscovers the skyscrapers of Manhattan sticking out \u2013 like the bones of a dinosaur \u2013 from 100ft-high sand dunes. But Ballard\u2019s fervid skill in conjuring up the sensation of silica on silicate was about to be eclipsed; Hollywood imagineers have a rapacious appetite for displaying the deluging, flaming, death-raying, exploding and otherwise laying waste to the central business districts of American cities. The Towering Inferno is filmed with only closeups, mid- and long-shots; with the advent of CGI, it becomes possible \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 for disbelief to remain suspended high above the skyscrapers, an all-seeing eye that contemplates The Day After Tomorrow for its entire nauseating duration. But by creating the super-viewer \u2013 taller, faster and stronger than a collapsing skyscraper \u2013 the imagineers have simply reconfigured the problem at a different scale; now we are too big to experience our cities\u2019 destruction feelingly, just as before we were too small to inhabit them empathetically. Lunch(ing) atop a Skyscraper, we were, each of us with his \u201cbaloney sub\u201d in waxed paper and his soda bottle, part of a Renaissance group reclining on a girder, one that wouldn\u2019t have been any more or less comfortable were that girder to have been lain on the ground in front of a half-built basilica. And surely, that was the entire point of what was intended to be a publicity shot for the RCA Building, a skyscraper completed in the same year King Kong was released. If the Hollywood studio doesn\u2019t mete out brimstone to go with the fire it rains down on the hubristic sinners of Babel, it\u2019s only because Smell-O-Vision never caught on. It\u2019s certainly not to do with any restraint on their part. Following the destruction of the Twin Towers by Al-Qaida-backed terrorists you might have expected some compunction about the vivid portrayal of skyscrapers being destroyed. Not a bit of it. \u2766      Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Photograph: WestEnd61/Rex Features     The willed destruction of the Twin Towers by religious fanatics steeped in Judaeo-Christian eschatology made this latent content so very manifest that the myth became a tale, the telling of which was effectively over. After 9/11, in a very important sense, the skyscraper simply ceased to exist. Just as my teenagers defend their first-person-shooting of virtualised Nazi zombies on the grounds that \u201cThey\u2019re Nazis and they\u2019re zombies\u201d, so the zombie skyscrapers continue to stalk the globe, but their raison d\u2019etre dispersed through the cloud of toxic dust that billowed out from Lower Manhattan throughout that endless and apocalyptic day. How to show the storied skyline after 9/11 became a problem for the visualisers. The release in 2008 of James Marsh\u2019s Man on Wire, a feature-length documentary about Philippe Petit\u2019s 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers was a cause not for the celebration of the indomitable human spirit but for a faux-reconnection with an earlier and more na\u00efve age, one when it was possible for a gang of renegade circus artists to breach security without too much trouble, all in the cause of a spectacle whimsical rather than world-shattering. This was a stupendous feat of bravery and conquest; during the hour-long walk, throughout which he frolicked and struck attitudes, Petit himself became a real-life Superman, apprehending the skyscrapers directly through his own twanging form. He subsequently found himself unable to comment on the destruction of the WTO (which Marsh\u2019s film also makes no mention of), but then the buildings that he had so romantically linked had ceased to exist, not simply now \u2013 but in 1974 as well. This is also why the presence in the opening sequence of The Sopranos of the Twin Towers, which are glimpsed over Tony Soprano\u2019s shoulder as he exits the Holland Tunnel en route to his mafia fiefdom of North Jersey, seems quite so unheimlich: in the face of the painful verisimilitude of the drama series \u2013 which inaugurated a renaissance in American TV drama that endures to this day \u2013 it is the World Trade Center that confirms its true status as pure fiction. The same might be said of the opening sequence of Mad Men, another lavishly produced television drama series that, in the manner of Balzac\u2019s Com\u00e9die humaine attempts to link together, through drama, the unravelling strands of American culture and society in the decades following the second world war. This sequence uses spare graphics of the style employed by the \u201cmad men\u201d of the title (a self-ascription of cynically self-congratulatory Madison Avenue advertising executives of the 1950s and 60s) to show a white-shirted, dark-suited man plunging downwards in mute supplication \u2013 arms outstretched, legs akimbo \u2013 past the cubism of sparsely limned skyscrapers. Although strenuously denied by its creators, this forces on the informed viewer\u2019s mind, quite unavoidably, the image of the so-called \u201cjumpers\u201d, those most benighted individuals, who, facing immolation in the fires raging after the hijacked planes smashed into the north and south towers, chose to fling themselves from the upper floors. In particular the Mad Men sequence recalls the most famous image of them: the \u201cFalling Man\u201d shot of a still-unidentified man plunging from the North Tower taken by the veteran AP photographer Richard Drew. It is easy to see the jumpers as a confirmation of the submerged but still-dominant Tower-of-Babel mythos of the western skyscraper. In The Towering Inferno the adulterous businessman is immolated \u2013 the first death we witness on screen \u2013 as he tries futilely to find a way out of the conflagration for him and his lover; shortly after this, the woman taken in sin jumps from the skyscraper. That the Twin Towers were credible icons of transnational capital flows, only serves to complete the apotheosis. In the years since the violent opponents of usury (a prohibition contemporary Salafist jihadis share with medieval Christians) launched their attack on the Babel-that-was-Mammon, the skyscraper has struggled to maintain any salience at all. \u2766     Islam\u2019s holiest shrine, the Kaaba and The Abraj al-Bait Towers (Mecca Royal Hotel Clock Tower) in Saudi Arabia. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty    In 2008, on a two-day hike across the auto-plutocratic city-state of Dubai and into the Empty Quarter of Arabia, I marvelled at skyscraper after skyscraper, built by indentured labour, and each seemingly a more bowdlerised example of that inherently bowdlerising architectural style, postmodernism. Hypertrophied mansard roofs supported by gargantuan Corinthian columns; Pantagruelian porticos leaning out over six-lane expressways planted with begonias drenched in costly desalinated water \u2013 the spectacle Dubai presents is of a last-chance saloon at which all the formal decadences of the west have come home to die. And then there is the matter of scale: by elevating detailing more suited to a sports shoe or an SUV thousands of feet into the sky, the Dubai skyscrapers themselves apotheosise those first Chicagoan up-thrusts, whereby the belle epoque was blasted into inner-space. The new International Style is that of the desktop toy writ horribly large. In London it isn\u2019t only the Shard that instantiates in the skyscraper a tendency the architectural critic Owen Hatherley has noted: to elide icon and logo in a single structure. The nicknames for these vast promotional devices follow ineluctably: \u201cthe Quill\u201d, \u201cthe Walkie-Talkie\u201d, and \u201cthe Cheesegrater\u201d have joined the Gherkin and the Shard itself in altering for the foreseeable future the skyline of the city. They are not alone: in the next 20 years, scores of skyscrapers are set to rise up from the London clay into the capital\u2019s smoggy heavens. I live in north Lambeth, hard by the dark carceral star of the new US Embassy, and this quarter is set to become engorged by the concrete poured into it and surfeited with the side dishes of reinforcing bars. I accord this development \u2013 in terms of my own life at least \u2013 to be a great irony: having failed to up sticks and move somewhere exotic while I still had the necessary verve, I\u2019ve awoken in middle age to find that Shanghai is my new neighbour. And while there may be desultory political coverage of these pharaonic undertakings the popular and collective apprehension of them is more or less nonexistent; apart, that is, from Private Eye\u2019s squib. It was said of Tolkien that, while a devout Catholic himself, he laboured carefully to expunge the Judaeo-Christian worldview from The Lord of the Rings, putting in its place what he saw as an older and deeper moral eschatology. That may well be; and it may also be true that the Two Towers of Isengard and Barad-dur (the Dark Tower) were inspired by a pair of particularly ugly Victorian water towers close to his boyhood home in Birmingham, but this meticulous scholar of Anglo-Saxon \u2013 and wild fantasist \u2013 nonetheless managed to zero in on the popular cultural consciousness of the 21st century with uncanny prescience. In June 2012, one in a whole series of Arab mega-structures was completed. Largely ignored in the west, these include the crazed bodkin of the Kingdom Centre in Riyadh, and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. In the next two decades, even this uppermost peak is set to be over-topped by at least 10 more vast skyscrapers in the region; but the Abraj al-Baitin Mecca are undoubtedly the purest expression of the deep correspondence between the Shard and Isengard. A hulk of pseudo neoclassicism only 11 metres shorter than the Burj Khalifa, the Towers do indeed tower over the Masjid al-Haram and its meteoric core, the Ka\u2019abah. Many of the 3,000 hotel rooms and suites are positioned so that their windows look down into the holy-of-holies, so encouraging devotion in their temporary tenants. But it is the giant clock set in the Mecca Royal Clock Tower forming Abraj al Bait\u2019s summit that cements together those two seemingly disparate lookalikes, the Shard and Isengard. Mohammed al-Arkubi, general manager of the hotel, is reported as saying that \u201cPutting Mecca time in the face of Greenwich Mean Time, this is the goal.\u201d It\u2019s a fruitless goal if he expects the inhabitants of Middle Earth \u2013 sorry, I mean the west \u2013 to pay any attention. We don\u2019t so much as look upon our own tower of Isengard, whose designer\u2019s stated aim was to create a skyscraper that disappeared vaporously into the surrounding atmosphere \u2013 and we know better than to even glance at the compound eye of Saruman that floats atop the Dark Tower of Barad-dur (sorry, I mean Abraj al Bait). And if you were to tell us that this skyscraping nemesis, like so many of the Arabian towers, had been built by the Saudi Binladin Group, why, we\u2019d only shrug our shoulders and observe, why not? After all, it is the biggest construction company in the world. \u2022 A version of this piece will appear in The Future of the Skyscraper, edited by Philip Nobel, part of the SOM Thinkers Series, to be published by Metropolis in May.

Yet, this time, just maybe, things are different. The national team are improving, the league is booming and, most importantly, the government is investing to ensure that the youth of the world\u2019s most populous country takes up its most popular game in its tens of millions. If this plan comes together, Japan, Asia\u2019s premier power, should watch out. In terms of league football, the Middle Kingdom is on the march. In 2011 the Chinese Super League overtook the J-league in terms of average attendance. In 2015 in terms of continental club competitions, it is living La Liga loca, while Japan\u2019s clubs are outdoing even their English equivalents in ineptitude. After three games of the 2015 Asian Champions League group stage Guangzhou Evergrande and Beijing Guoan have more individual points than all four Japanese teams combined. Of the J-League quartet, only Kashiwa Reysol have won a game. Urawa Reds, Gamba Osaka and Kashima Antlers \u2013 perhaps the three biggest teams in Japan \u2013 have, between them, lost eight and drawn one of their nine. Foreign players are playing a major part in closing the gap. China is now the go-to Asian market for the best overseas talent thanks to the money invested in a number of clubs, often by flush real estate companies. J-League teams can\u2019t compete. Guangzhou, winner of the past four titles and the 2013 Asian crown, were the first and are the best. A 4-3 win over Kashima last week showed once again the difference that top-class imports can make, with the Brazil international Ricardo Goulart, signed for \u20ac15m in the close season, grabbing a hat-trick. Other clubs are spending in an attempt to catch up. Jang Hyun-soo is a South Korean international who was signed from FC Tokyo by Sven-Goran Eriksson in 2014 at Guangzhou R&amp;F. The Swede left at the end of last season, tempted by the even greater riches at Shanghai SIPG, but Jang remains and has high hopes for the game in China. \u201cThe Chinese Super League is improving all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are good players and good coaches with lots of clubs investing. In terms of individual talent, there is not much difference between [Chinese players and] Korean and Japanese players, it\u2019s similar. The understanding of tactics is not as good, however, and the same can be said of their reading of in-game situations,\u201d adds Jang, who believes this aspect will improve over time, helped by the influence of foreign coaches and players. \u201cChinese football has its own style and atmosphere, it\u2019s like Europe. The games never stop. I am much more tired after a game in China than I was in Korea or Japan.\u201d Japan produce better players but the best tend not to tarry, heading to Europe in increasing numbers whereas Chinese clubs are able to keep hold of their top local talent. This makes the east Asian scene, according to Urawa\u2019s coach, Mihailo Petrovic, more equal. Some Chinese clubs are starting to discuss the possibility of looking at the top end of the J-League as a new market to go with the growing number of Korea internationals active in the CSL. Few players/clubs would be able to resist the salaries/fees. Tim Cahill is an Asian star inspiring Shanghai Shenhua to unusually good form. The fact that the Australian\u2019s two goals knocked China out of the Asian Cup in January at the quarter-final stage has not dimmed his popularity. The Red Dragons were pleased at the progress made after years of disappointment. In Australian press rooms, the sight of Chinese scribes smiling was, after years of frustration and chain-smoking, as strange and refreshing as the Japanese sports drink Pocari Sweat. Buying the best foreigners offers rapid improvement but the real path to the top is built upon youth development, an area where Japan are light years ahead. Finally though, there are concrete and coordinated moves to improve the quantity and quality of young players produced in China. The population is there but the players are not. There\u2019s no mystery. Chinese youth just don\u2019t play the game in big numbers. President Xi Jinping, a football fan, wants to change this. The ministry of education has introduced a compulsory programme that will be in 20,000 schools by 2017. It all means that, soon, approximately eight million kids will be playing regular football and that\u2019s just the start. Last week Chengdu announced it will build 300 football pitches and Shandong\u2019s schools will stop volleyball and basketball to focus on football. Other cities are following suit to create extensive local leagues. Public cynicism about Chinese football, formed by years of disappointment, incompetence and scandals, may hardly be easier to break down than an Italian defence marshalled by the new Guangzhou Evergrande coach, Fabio Cannavaro, but it is starting to erode. Having the World Cup would help \u2013 last week the Chinese government announced plans to bid and Fifa is unlikely to refuse. The tournament should happen some time in the 2030s. Two decades or so from now, a new generation of players should be ready. The 2002 World Cup was a major milestone in the development of Japanese football. By the 2030s China\u2019s league should be established as one of the world\u2019s best, with the national team an Asian power. Hosting the event could take everything to the next level. There is no debate that one day China\u2019s economy will become the biggest in the world. The only question is when. In football, there is no such sense of inevitably but for the first time perhaps, China is starting to look like it can not only overtake Japan to become Asia\u2019s best but can join the ranks of the football superpowers.", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "China"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-28T10:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/29/chinatown-restaurants-london-threat-rent-rises", "sentences": ["His mother washed up while his father made Shanghai noodles, because few others could, before turning his hand to supplying foodstuffs from Covent Garden to the burgeoning number of local restaurants."], "title": "Big trouble in little Chinatown as rent rises force restaurant owners out", "article": "Jon Man points at the busy KFC a few doors along from his own restaurant on Wardour Street, one of the small number of bustling streets that make up London\u2019s Chinatown. \u201cThat\u2019s the best business around here,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the one I would choose.\u201d Man\u2019s parents emigrated from Hong Kong in the 1950s to work in Britain\u2019s growing restaurant trade, bolstered as it was by the willingness of those freshly returned from foreign frontlines to taste new foods.

He knows everyone, and they all know him, but his children, 18 and 21, won\u2019t follow him to work there. More significantly, he can\u2019t see how he or his peers can stay. London\u2019s little Chinatown is, he suggests, in big trouble. The business model for these few teeming streets, squashed between the inelegant cinemas and hotels of Leicester Square and fashionable Soho, has long been cheap-and-cheerful food sold to theatregoers, office workers, late-night revellers and, to a lesser degree, tourists, not always by the most polite of serving staff. Chinese supermarkets, massage parlours and, for a long time, just three betting shops discreetly tucked away, added to the mix. A certain authenticity has given the area its niche. It was a genuine community built by the emigrants from Hong Kong who, having been bombed out of Limehouse in the East End in the 1940s, made this patch of London, with its cheap commercial rents, their own.

The rough-and-ready charms of Chinatown today don\u2019t necessarily fit in a city where a square foot of land can demand a rent of \u00a3838 a year. Eighteen years ago, Man was paying \u00a366,000 a year in rent. In 2012, after a year of wrangling with his landlord, Shaftesbury, which owns the premises of 71 restaurants in the area, that increased to \u00a3244,000. He is due another rent review in two years, when it will go up again, probably significantly. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to stay,\u201d he says. \u201cThere will be no point in me being here. So many of my friends have already gone.\u201d   Related: Food For Thought, London's iconic vegetarian restaurant, set for closure    Shaftesbury admits that about 10% of the restaurants it owns have changed hands in the last two years, although Man says that such churn, so damaging to the community, has been a fact of life for longer than that, and more of the same should be expected. The Cheun Cheng restaurant, also on Wardour Street, distinctive for the enormous model dragon above its door, was owned by the same family for 40 years. They closed down 18 months ago and, with one eye on custom from the huge new hotels in the area, it is to be replaced by a steak house. The owners of Loon Tao on Gerrard Street, who have been there for 20 years, are looking to get out having seen their rent soar from \u00a3160,000 five years ago to \u00a3312,000.

Not as I know it.\u201d     A number of Chinatown\u2019s businesses are reportedly for sale despite the area\u2019s continued bustling popularity. Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer    The landlords can be confident in demanding exorbitant rents because if the current businesses won\u2019t pay, others most certainly will. DeVono, a commercial property agency, reports that demand for a foothold in London has tripled since March 2013. They say there is a year-long waiting list for hopeful entrants \u2013 \u201ceating brands\u201d. The right restaurant, often with the financial backing of a chain, can make a fortune. And the landlords setting the rents know it. Shaftesbury, whose real estate portfolio includes 575 properties in Carnaby Street, Covent Garden, Soho and Charlotte Street, as well as Chinatown, saw profits grow by almost 50% in the six months to the end of March 2014. So the profits are there to be had, but can the independent Chinese restaurants, often one-man bands who have been in Chinatown for decades, be the ones to extract them? \u201cThere is footfall,\u201d Man admits, \u201cbut they don\u2019t spend money. The tourists come over, have a photo taken and disappear. They go to the KFC. \u201cThere is nothing apart from the theatre to attract people who will spend money here. Leicester Square is just big hotels. One side of one of the roads in Chinatown is the side wall of the M&amp;M\u2019s store. The road is dead and it used to be full of retail. And since the congestion charge, and what with the lack of parking, even those coming for the theatre don\u2019t drive and stay for a meal. They run off for the last train home. As the rent has gone up our turnover has gone down. And I can\u2019t increase my prices because the customers won\u2019t come.\u201d Shaftesbury says rent rises are just a reaction to market forces. They won\u2019t, they admit, rescue failing businesses because \u201cthat would be daft\u201d. And there are plenty of restaurants, Chinese or otherwise, willing to come in and pay the rents. Man argues that those new entrants might not be so willing if they knew the truth. He has set up the West End Chinatown Tenants\u2019 Association, through which restaurateurs already in Chinatown and those who are looking to get in can share information about rents. \u201cThere is new money coming from China, but they come over and accept extremely high rents, don\u2019t know the market here and, within months, want to get out because there is no money to be made. \u201cThat then sets a benchmark for all our rent reviews, and it is artificial. If we can share information, maybe we can help each other keep the rent down.\u201d But there is also a broader political question, according to Gareth Thomas, the shadow deputy minister for London, who is being mooted as a Labour candidate in the next mayoral election. \u201cThe mayor needs to champion small businesses and independent entrepreneurs, putting them at the heart of regeneration and modernisation plans and standing up to the big property companies on their behalf,\u201d said Thomas.

It\u2019s about the love affair between a married woman and a department store clerk, played by Rooney Mara, and given that filming wrapped last April, there\u2019s a very good shot of it sneaking in. The Childhood of a Leader      The Childhood of a Leader    Brady Corbet\u2019s made a career of being That Guy Who Was Great in That Thing. You half-recognised him in Thirteen, Melancholia or Martha Marcy May Marlene, now \u2013 finally \u2013 it might be his time to shine. His directorial debut, The Childhood of a Leader, will push many of the selectors\u2019 buttons: it\u2019s arty (based on a Jean-Paul Sartre short story), starry (Robert Pattinson, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo) and sufficiently Francophile (set in Paris during the first world war, shot in both English and French). Director\u2019s Fortnight at least.  Dheepan     Jacques Audiard. Photograph: LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP/Getty Images    As close as we\u2019ll get to a red carpet shoo-in, Jacques Audiard\u2019s latest will likely follow in the footsteps of his previous films A Prophet and Rust and Bone, which both premiered at the fest. His new film is a drama about the immigrant experience in France with a Sri Lankan Tamil warrior getting a job as a caretaker in Paris. The Early Years     Paolo Sorrentino. Photograph: David Levene    Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s films have been a fixture at Cannes since his second feature, The Consequences of Love; no doubt a slot has been reserved for this next one should Sorrentino deem it desirable. News that The Early Years \u2013 which stars Michael Caine as an orchestral conductor summoned from Switzerland to play for the Queen of England \u2013 is in English doesn\u2019t, to be honest, bode well; Sorrentino\u2019s last English-language film, This Must Be the Place, drew lukewarm notices and baffled reactions for Sean Penn\u2019s goth-rocker turn. Still, we can forgive him a lot after (the Oscar-winning) The Great Beauty. Elle     Isabelle Huppert. Photograph: LOIC VENANCE/AFP/Getty Images     Related: The 88 movies we're most excited about in 2015    It\u2019s been an awfully long time since Paul Verhoeven has made one of his trademark trashy thrillers but the Showgirls director is ticking all of the lurid boxes with his latest, which pairs him with unlikely collaborator Isabelle Huppert. Haneke\u2019s oft-used favourite stars as a woman stalked by an unknown assailant who turns the tables and starts to stalk him back. Fans of Hitchcockian psychosexual schlock should keep an eye out for this one and given that it\u2019s Verhoeven\u2019s first film in French, a festival spot could be a possibility. Flashmob     Michael Haneke. Photograph: Francois Durand/Getty Images    Mystery surrounds Michael Haneke\u2019s latest, which follows a disparate group of characters brought together by the internet, with the director proving to be tight-lipped over whether filming has even begun. But, if his ode to the web is in the can, the two-time Palme d\u2019Or winner is likely to unveil it at Cannes, given his affinity with the festival. High Rise       Tom Hiddleston in High Rise    Ben Wheatley takes on JG Ballard. The story couldn\u2019t be much more Cannes: a luxury tower block\u2019s residents declare war on each other after shutting the door on the outside world. Tom Hiddleston will be scaling the social hierarchy as Robert Laing, a doctor enticed into the Randian nightmare, while Jeremy Irons plays the architect of the allegorical stack. The star power of High Rise warrants a flashy premiere, in an invite-only screening, locked away from the masses. Stay near an exit. Inside Out            After a year off from releasing a film, for the first time since 2005, Pixar should be making a triumphant return with this fascinatingly strange animation about the emotions in a girl\u2019s head interacting with each other. A comically adept voice cast, including Amy Poehler, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling, suggests greatness and after the ecstatic reaction to opener Up back in 2009, Cannes seems like the perfect place to launch. Irrational Man      Woody Allen     Named for William Barrett\u2019s 1958 primer for existential philosophy, the new one from Woody Allen has a potentially less-co-operative-than-usual lead in Joaquin Phoenix \u2013 though since Phoenix plays an academic who has an affair with a student (Emma Stone, back again after Magic in the Moonlight), this may not be so much of a departure after all. Hard to tell which way this will go, as Allen has blown hot and cold in equal measure recently but \u2013 like everyone else \u2013 we\u2019re always hoping. Jane Got a Gun            Gavin O\u2019Connor\u2019s film, about a homesteader (Natalie Portman) protecting her brood against a bullying gang, has had plenty of stones in the shoe. Original director Lynne Ramsay skipped town after a disagreement with the producers. Star Jude Law went with her. Bradley Cooper replaced Law, then Ewan McGregor replaced Cooper when he too bailed. Still, western-a-likes (The Homesman, Blue Ruin) play well on the French riviera. Perhaps, despite the showdown, Jane still has firepower? The Last Face     Charlize Theron and Sean Penn. Photograph: Joel Ryan/Invision/AP    Mixing his professional and romantic lives hasn\u2019t always led to great things in the past for Sean Penn with Madonna-starrer Shanghai Surprise proving a notorious flop in 1986. But he\u2019s hoping his latest film as director, an African drama which stars his girlfriend and rumoured fianc\u00e9e Charlize Theron, will prove more successful. Penn\u2019s relationship with the festival, which included a stint as president of the jury in 2008, means a Cannes debut is likely.  The Little Prince            An eclectic voice cast (Marion Cotillard! Jeff Bridges! James Franco! Rachel McAdams! Benicio del Toro! Bud Cort!) and a curious mix of computer and stop motion animation suggest this could be a classy alternative to other kids\u2019 movies this summer. The release of a French language trailer and a confirmed release date in France make this a likely inclusion. The Lobster       The Lobster    As winner of the Un Certain Regard section in 2009 for Dogtooth, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos probably has a Cannes place on hold forever. The new one looks like it will be ready in time; a characteristically wacky idea about a future society where non-mating humans are kicked out into the forest where they turn into animals. It\u2019s in English (and has funding from the BFI), and has a classy cast, including Lea Seydoux, Olivia Colman, Ben Whishaw, Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz. Louder than Bombs     Jesse Eisenberg. Photograph: Linda Nylind/Guardian    The festival has seen a number of failed attempts from acclaimed international directors to present their first English language films from Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s My Blueberry Nights to Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s This Must Be the Place and Oslo, August 31st director Joachim Trier is hoping his Jesse Eisenberg/Isabelle Huppert drama will be an exception to the rule. Love          Cannes loves mucky-minded Gaspar No\u00e9. All of his films have premiered at the festival, while the Argentine director has been twice nominated for the Palme d\u2019Or (for Irreversible and Enter the Void). His new film, Love, has been coquettishly described as \u201ca sexual melodrama about a boy and a girl and another girl\u201d, but the poster suggests unbridled raunch. Actually the film\u2019s likely to be somewhere in between. No\u00e9\u2019s too smart to make his films too shallow.  Love in Khon Kaen          Apichatpong Weerasethakul won the Palme d\u2019Or in 2010 for his mystifying ghost story Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. French critics hated it, but it would be unbelievably churlish for Cannes to not offer him a spot, if he\u2019s game. The Thai director\u2019s newie, Love in Kohn Kaen, tells the story of a lonely housewife looking after a soldier suffering from sleeping sickness. The blurb promises \u201challucinations, dreams, phantoms and car chases\u201d, though we may have hallucinated that last one.  Macbeth          There\u2019s a lot of interest in this, the followup to Australian director Justin Kurzel\u2019s gruesome Snowtown. Traditionally, Macbeth affords a good opportunity for serious blood and guts, which Kurzel has shown to be his forte, while Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard \u2013 as Lord and Lady M \u2013 are both capable of powerhouse performances. The film seems to have an autumn release slot, but Snowtown\u2019s success off the back of a Cannes Critics\u2019 Week opening suggests this one is riviera-bound. Midnight Special          \u201cA big PG summer blockbuster family film\u201d, according to Jeff Nichols, who\u2019s well on his way to becoming a Cannes fixture. He was nominated for the Palme d\u2019Or with Mud and won the Critics Week grand prize for Take Shelter. Midnight Special features Michael Shannon on the run from Adam Driver after his son develops supernatural powers. We reckon this\u2019ll almost certainly pop up, likely in competition. The alternative would be to wait it out for Sundance next January. By then, that special will be cold. Mia Madre     Nanni Moretti. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images    This looks like a dead cert. Former Palme d\u2019Or winner Nanni Moretti directs and acts in a film about a film director juggling a tricky big name American actor on set, and a rough home life with a sick mother. Moretti, though, doesn\u2019t play the director: that\u2019s Margherita Buy, who has acted for Moretti before, in We Have a Pope and The Caiman. John Turturro is getting back to his roots as the imported star. Ricki and the Flash          Meryl Streep continues to prove the (only) exception to the rule that women over 50 don\u2019t get offered interesting roles with a lead as a woman who abandons her family to become a rock star only to return years later to make amends. A script from Oscar winner Diablo Cody suggests a darkly funny streak and matched with direction from fellow Oscar winner Jonathan Demme, who scored with similar material in 2008\u2019s Rachel Getting Married, it could make this one an early awards contender. The Sea of Trees          It\u2019s been a patchy few years for Gus Van Sant with fracking drama Promised Land and schmaltzy romance Restless both crashing, but his latest sounds like a promising curio, if nothing else. The plot has Matthew McConaughey as a suicidal man on a journey to salvation with help from Ken Watanabe, suggesting that it\u2019ll be a return to Van Sant\u2019s more daring work. Sunset Song       Photograph: Hurricanefilms    It seems like Terence Davies\u2019 adaptation of Lewis Grassic Gibbons\u2019s classic novel has been on the big-hopes list for at least a decade, but it now looks as if it will see the light of day in the not too distant future. With Davies taking bit of a risk casting model Agyness Deyn as farmer\u2019s daughter Chris Guthrie, bruised and battered by hardscrabble life in northeast Scotland in the early 20th century, this may or may not turn out to be a triumph; but Davies is a festival favourite, with his first three features all selected for Cannes. If ready, this should be there. A Tale of Love and Darkness     Natalie Portman on set. Photograph: ABIR SULTAN/EPA    The directorial debut of Natalie Portman, based on Israeli author Amos Oz\u2019s book of the same name, an autobiographical account of growing up in Jerusalem during the early years of Israel. Portman, who was born in the city before moving to the US age three, also takes a role, playing Oz\u2019s mother. Should take a spot based on Portman\u2019s prestige alone.  The Tale of Tales           Italian director Matteo Garrone won the second-prize Cannes grand prix for his last feature, Reality (as well as for the one before, Gomorrah) so, like his compatriot Paolo Sorrentino, you\u2019d presume the festival will find room for the new one, whatever it\u2019s like. Garrone describes The Tale of Tales as \u201ca fantasy film with horror elements\u201c; it\u2019s an adaptation of Giambattista Basile\u2019s 17th century collection of fairy tales that, like Sorrentino\u2019s latest, is being shot in English. Salma Hayek, John C Reilly and Toby Jones lead the cast; we\u2019re betting it\u2019ll be on the Croisette. Sicario      Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Prisoners    Denis Villeneuve\u2019s intriguingly murky CV, including thrillers Incendies, Prisoners and Enemy, looks to get even darker with his latest, a gritty crime drama starring Emily Blunt as a cop hunting a drug lord. Villenueve is no stranger to the Croisette, having premiered three of his films there, and although we\u2019re yet to even see a still from this one, it\u2019s a strong possibility for the fest. Southpaw            An outside bet. Antoine Fuqua\u2019s boxing drama stars Jake Gyllenhaal as (cliche counter at the ready) a washed-up fighter lining up one last bout in order to reconnect with his family and regain his self-respect. Bold, emotionally strident and morally clear-cut, this would be a dead cert for Toronto if the US release date didn\u2019t precede that festival by a month. Cannes is its only chance for a high profile festival premiere. Stranger things have happened.  Tomorrowland            Disney has been keeping its cards close to its chest for this one, especially considering how close we are to the May release, but it\u2019s likely that Brad Bird\u2019s sci-fi adventure will be launched during the fest. We know that it stars George Clooney, it has some sort of connection to Disneyland (previews of footage are happening at various parks) and, given Bird\u2019s knack for majestic action (from The Incredibles to Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol) it should be one of the summer\u2019s most satisfying blockbusters. Trespass Against Us     Michael Fassbender. Photograph: LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS    Variety are suggesting this thriller from British director Adam Smith won\u2019t be ready in time, but if so, it\u2019d be a shame. The advance word has been impressive for this gangster pic starring Michael Fassbender; he plays a man who is looking for a way out of his criminal family ways. Smith, who cut his teeth doing music videos for the Streets and the Chemical Brothers, has got the latter to write the score. But here\u2019s hoping it makes the cut. Triple Nine     Chiwetel Ejiofor. Photograph: LUCY NICHOLSON/REUTERS    A toothsome cast, including Anthony Mackie, Kate Winslet, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Casey Affleck back up this cops-and-robbers thriller directed by John \u201cThe Road\u201d Hillcoat. The title refers to a police code, 999, that an officer has been shot; a cop-killing is to be used as a distraction by a crew of heisters. It ought to be ready for Cannes \u2013 and Hillcoat\u2019s history with the festival (Lawless, The Proposition) should secure this from Toronto\u2019s clutches.  \u2022 This article was amended on 31 March to correct the spelling of Toby Jones\u2019s name.", "tags": ["Cannes 2015", "Film", "Culture", "Festivals", "Toronto film festival", "Venice film festival", "Casey Affleck"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-30T11:43:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/30/islam-karimov-re-elected-uzbekistans-president-in-predicted-landslide", "sentences": ["Monitoring missions from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which include former Soviet republics and China, called the election open and democratic."], "title": "Islam Karimov re-elected Uzbekistan's president in predicted landslide", "article": "Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan\u2019s authoritarian president since 1990, has won re-election in a predictable landslide victory that will put him in office for another five years. According to preliminary results announced on Monday by the central Asian state\u2019s electoral commission, Karimov, 77, won 90.39% of the votes in Sunday\u2019s election, which was roundly criticised by western observers for irregularities and lack of competition.    Related: Islam Karimov set to reprise presidential role as Uzbekistan heads to the polls    This will be his third term under the current constitution, even though that same treaty limits presidents to two terms, an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe observer mission noted in a report. The only question going into the election was how badly Karimov would trounce his three toothless competitors from the country\u2019s other parliamentary parties, who have themselves praised the president as the best candidate. The electoral commission put the turnout at an impressive 91.08%. Monitoring missions from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which include former Soviet republics and China, called the election open and democratic. Although Vladimir Churov, the Russian electoral commission head also lauded the vote, he told the state news agency RIA Novosti that \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as totally clean elections\u201d and said his team would discuss \u201ccertain remarks on the organisation of the voting\u201d with local authorities. Autocratic leaders across the former Soviet Union have been known to dispatch \u201cquid pro quo\u201d observer missions to each others\u2019 elections to lend them legitimacy. But the OSCE observer report on the election catalogued many \u201clegal and organisational shortcomings,\u201d noting that slavish media coverage gave Karimov a \u201cclear advantage\u201d and that \u201cproxy voting on behalf of several voters appeared to be universally practised\u201d.

Related: Uzbekistan's ruling family feud spills into open with Twitter row    A Human Rights Watch report in September said Karimov\u2019s government had locked up thousands of critics, including activists, journalists, artists and clerics. Of 34 prisoners profiled, 29 made credible allegations of torture and ill treatment, including beatings, electric shocks, and hanging from wrists and ankles. Analysts have said the ageing Karimov is trying to postpone a power transition that has recently been complicated by an ugly family feud. Last autumn, the president\u2019s oldest daughter, Gulnara Karimova, an occasional pop star and businesswoman whose dealings are the subject of two corruption investigations in Europe, accused her sister of sorcery and claimed her mother was trying to \u201cdestroy\u201d her. Before her Twitter account was mysteriously shut down, Karimova also accused the powerful head of Uzbekistan\u2019s security service, Rustam Inoyatov, of attempting a power grab.

Europe has promised a 40% emissions cut by 2030, compared to 1990 levels \u2013 and the report says this will bring real benefits, including 70,000 full-time jobs, the prevention of around 6,000 pollution-related deaths, and a \u20ac33bn cut in fossil fuel imports. But if emissions were slashed by around 55% \u2013 the study\u2019s proposed route for holding global warming to two degrees \u2013 those benefits would multiply to $173bn fuel savings, 420,000 full-time clean energy jobs and 46,000 lives saved, its authors say. 31 March is the deadline for developed countries to submit their climate pledges for the conference (so called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs), but few have yet done so and nations such as Canada and Japan are expected to miss the bell.  \u201cThis report adds to the growing body of evidence that greater climate ambition means better health,\u201d said Anne Stauffer, the deputy director of the Health and Environment Alliance.  \u201cThe massive health benefits expected from mitigation action not only include premature deaths avoided but also reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity. This should be welcome news for European decision-makers.\u201d In other parts of the world, the effects of increased climate ambition would be even more dramatic, according to the New Climate Institute\u2019s (NCI) analysis which uses data from the International Energy Agency. Putting China on course for a world warmed only by two degrees would save over a million lives and create almost 2m jobs \u2013 compared to the 100,000 lives and 500,000 jobs set out in its climate deal with the US. Comparable figures in the US for a 2C pathway would see 650,000 new jobs created and 27,000 deaths avoided. \u201cDespite the major achievements of the INDCs, this study has shown that the potential co-benefits of strengthening INDCs to meet a 2C compatible trajectory are many times higher than those already achieved,\u201d the paper says. Global temperatures have already risen by 0.85 degrees since 1880, according to the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). As the warming effect of CO2 emissions is thought to take a decade to materialise, we may already be committed to over one degree of warming. In the long term, that is likely to risk the future of coastal cities such as New York, Shanghai and Calcutta, according to scientists at the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research. If the planet warms by 2C by 2100, the Royal Society expects to see a third of the world\u2019s currently-cultivated agricultural land disappear, the bleaching of all coral reefs, and an increase in water stress for 410m people. At a rise of 4C, the limits for human and environmental adaptation are likely to be exceeded in many parts of the world, a 2010 paper by the Society said. It envisaged around half of the world\u2019s current agricultural land becoming unusable, sea level rises of up to two metres, and the extinction of about 40% of the world\u2019s species, as droughts and wildfires ravaged the globe.  \u201cThe ecosystem services upon which human livelihoods depend would not be preserved,\u201d the study found.  \u201cOur industries must face the challenge of massive decarbonisation,\u201d said Sharan Burrow, the International Trade Union Confederation\u2019s secretary-general.  \u201cWe have the technology and there are millions of jobs possible from the necessary investment and millions more saved if we avoid the devastation of extreme climate change.

The researchers believe the technology could be used to judge whether proposed anti-ageing treatments have any effect, and to help doctors fine-tune advice and therapies for their patients. They developed the technology after scanning the faces of more than 300 people aged 17 to 77 and building up a map that reveals how the human face changes over a lifetime. For each image, the subtle contours of the face were captured in tens of thousands of 3D points in space which the system could then use to assess a person\u2019s biological age. In contrast to chronological age - simply the number of birthdays a person has had - biological age reflects how well (or not) a person\u2019s body is getting older. From young adulthood to old age, the images captured the process of steady decline. Mouths become wider, noses larger. The corners of the eyes droop. The face loses its smoothness, becomes plump with subcutaneous fat, and the whole lot sags as gravity triumphs over the collagen and elastin fabric of the skin. The scientist found that most people\u2019s chronological ages lay within six years of their \u201cfacial age\u201d as predicted by the computer. So people who had facial ages of 30, were typically aged 24 to 36 years old.      Similarly, this image shows the male average face for each age group. Composite: Chinese Academy of Sciences    But despite the discrepancy, the scientists found that facial age was a more accurate reflection of a person\u2019s biological age, that is, the state of their bodies as revealed by blood tests that measure signs of ageing. The finding came about when the researchers analysed blood profiles from all the men and women they studied, and checked their real and facial ages against blood markers for ageing, including total cholesterol in women, and albumin, the main protein in human blood plasma, in men.  \u201cI did not expect to see such remarkable changes with age, nor did I expect the 3D images to be such a good biomarker for biological age,\u201d Jing-Dong Han told the Guardian from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. \u201cThey turned out to be as accurate as the most accurate marker to date.\u201d What is unclear is whether the same facial features can predict ageing so well in other ethnic groups. Among the 332 people who took part in the study were a small number who, according to their facial ages, were growing old either much faster or much slower than average. Some of the people\u2019s faces appeared more than ten years older or younger than their real, chronological ages. When Han looked at the blood profiles of these outliers, she found that they too reflected either rapid or much slower ageing than normal. \u201cThe predicted fast agers do have more accelerated ageing blood profiles, and vice versa for the slower agers,\u201d Han said.  She believes that the system, described in Cell Research, could be used to test whether products touted for their anti-ageing effects make any difference. In the longer term, she said, it could aid doctors as a simple way to a measure how well people are ageing, and to help them advise patients on changes to their lifestyles, or to personalise treatments when they fall ill. \u201cReliable and easy prediction of the ageing process is not only important for assessing the degree of the ageing process and its reversal, but it is also important for assessing the risks of ageing-associated diseases, for designing personalised treatment schemes, and for individuals to improve their life styles and health,\u201d Han said.", "tags": ["Science", "Medical research", "Ageing"], "publicationDate": "2015-03-31T10:37:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/dick-advocaat-john-carver-sunderland-newcastle", "sentences": ["Aware 2015 is the Chinese year of the sheep Pardew decided to have a bit of fun and was assured his gesture would be well received in Beijing, Shanghai and assorted points in between."], "title": "Dick Advocaat and John Carver sweat on their futures in north-east derby", "article": "It was the week before Christmas and Alan Pardew had embraced the festive spirit.

Aware 2015 is the Chinese year of the sheep Pardew decided to have a bit of fun and was assured his gesture would be well received in Beijing, Shanghai and assorted points in between. Within a couple of days, though, that little piece of film was well on the way to becoming irrelevant and outdated. On Sunday 21 December Newcastle lost 1-0 at home to Sunderland, courtesy of Adam Johnson\u2019s 90th-minute goal and the sun vanished from Pardew\u2019s eyes. It was the fourth straight defeat he had suffered against Sunderland and there is a sense at St James\u2019 Park that the backlash played a significant part in prompting his defection to Crystal Palace in the new year. Back then Gus Poyet\u2019s already uneasy relationship with Sunderland looked set to limp on until the summer but a deterioration in already disappointing results led to the Uruguayan being replaced by Dick Advocaat last month. By peculiar coincidence, Advocaat\u2019s second match in charge \u2013 and first at the Stadium of Light \u2013 features Newcastle\u2019s visit. In April 2013 Paolo Di Canio marked his second game at Sunderland\u2019s helm with a 3-0 win on Tyneside while that October, Poyet presided over a 2-1 home win against the local enemy in his second match. Should Advocaat complete an unlikely hat-trick of such victories, John Carver can almost certainly say goodbye to his already slender hopes of remaining in charge on Tyneside after his short-term head coach contract expires this summer. Carver is well aware Graham Carr, Newcastle\u2019s powerful chief scout, admires Derby County\u2019s Steve McClaren and knows that other coaches, most notably the former Lyon manager R\u00e9mi Garde, continue to covet the post. Yet although there are those at St James\u2019 who believe the job is McClaren\u2019s to turn down, the hierarchy are said to be impressed with the way Carver, a Newcastle fan since boyhood, has conducted himself in the midst of an injury crisis and accept he has been under-resourced. Seventeen years his counterpart\u2019s senior, the much-travelled Advocaat is as worldly as they come. Even as a veteran of Old Firm clashes, the former Holland and Rangers manager may be slightly taken aback by the intense wall of noise which will greet the teams on Sunday. He also labours under the disadvantage that, while Carver\u2019s team remain effectively safe in mid-table, Sunderland\u2019s high risk of relegation means points are imperative. A crowd of almost 50,000 will pack the Stadium of Light to capacity with the majority willing a home side who have won only one of their last 13 Premier League games to victory. Along the way Sunderland have scored just once in six matches, but Newcastle also bring unwanted baggage to the party. Carver\u2019s side have collected only nine points in 2015 \u2013 only three more than their neighbours \u2013 and arrive without two key players in the suspended Fabricio Coloccini and Papiss Ciss\u00e9. Throw in the injuries sidelining Steven Taylor, Siem de Jong, Massadio Ha\u00efdara, Paul Dummett and Cheick Tiot\u00e9 and, on paper at least, Sunderland appear slight favourites. If Advocaat could have done without a knee injury ruling out Wes Brown for the next five weeks, he has Lee Cattermole available after suspension against a somewhat ersatz-looking visiting side expected to feature Daryl Janmaat, a right-back, at centre-half and Jack Colback, a former Sunderland midfielder, at left-back. \u201cCattermole\u2019s our controller,\u201d Advocaat says. \u201cHe moves the ball quickly.\u201d While much may hinge on whether Cattermole can counter Carver\u2019s own midfield star, Moussa Sissoko, Sunderland\u2019s outstanding individual is one player capable of influencing Advocaat\u2019s hopes of retaining the post beyond his nine-game remit. Three further questions promise to prove similarly pivotal: can Jermain Defoe finally justify Sunderland\u2019s hefty January investment by relocating his shooting boots?; will Johnson (on police bail while allegations of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, which he denies, are pursued) cope with some inevitably ferocious baiting from travelling fans?; is Advocaat\u2019s often rather static defence capable of withstanding Newcastle\u2019s formidable counterattacking pace? The answers could help determine which division Sunderland play in next season \u2013 not to mention shape the futures of Carver and Advocaat.", "tags": ["Newcastle United", "Sunderland", "Alan Pardew", "Gus Poyet", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-02T16:14:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/04/football-north-korea-riots-sanctions", "sentences": ["Two of the games were played in Shanghai because the North refused to allow South Korea\u2019s flag to fly in Pyongyang.", "Related: Attitudes changing as North Korea gear up for Asian Cup | John Duerden    Cockrell attended the Shanghai games and described an \u201coverwhelming South Korean fan presence,\u201d and a small but vocal group of supporters for the North Korean team."], "title": "From riots to sanctions: a short history of North Korean football", "article": "Pyongyang is not associated with mobs of violent football fans, its population largely consisting of middle class citizens rewarded for their loyalty to the state with large apartments, cinemas, bowling alleys and other luxuries. But in March 2005, as North Korea\u2019s national team failed to qualify for the next year\u2019s World Cup in a match against Iran, violence erupted at Kim Il-sung stadium in the heart of the city. Iran\u2019s coach at the time was Branko Ivankovi\u0107, a veteran of the Croatian football team NK Vara\u017edin. He said his team had arrived in the country having been asked to bring their own food, as there was apparently not enough available in North Korea. \u201cThe hotel was OK, but you could see it wasn\u2019t clean, not kept well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stadium was also OK, but they hadn\u2019t finished a lot of things.\u201d The stadium that day was packed with up to 50,000 spectators, said Ivankovi\u0107, and almost over capacity.    Related: North Korea aim to improve their attack    North Korea had little chance of progressing to the 2006 tournament hosted by Germany. The team was at the bottom of their qualifying group \u2013 having already lost to Bahrain and Japan.  In the final moments of an already ill-tempered match, with DPRK 2-0 down, a piece of controversial play by Iran led the North Korean players to rush Syrian referee Mohamed Kousa and demanded a free kick. Instead a North Korean player got a red card. It was the last straw. North Korea\u2019s normally well-behaved football fans, convinced the referee was biased, began throwing chairs, bottles and stones at the pitch. \u201cIt was a very tough game,\u201d Ivankovi\u0107 said. \u201cNorth Korea, they have good players, they played with a lot of patience, with a lot of emotion. For [the players] football is really the whole world \u2013 football gives them a better life.\u201d Thousands rushed the pitch as the match ended, preventing the Iranian team from getting on their bus, and riot police and soldiers had to intervene. \u201cI was scared and nobody knew what was going on,\u201d said Ivankovi\u0107. The team were forced to wait for a few hours in a dressing room for the crowds to be dispersed by the police, he added.  State media reported the game but offered only a hint of what had unfolded: \u201cAt the end of the match all the spectators were angered and vigorously protested the wrong refereeing by the Syrian referee and linesmen,\u201d wrote KCNA, although mentions of the fans\u2019 protests were added to later versions of the piece. The violence was so bad that Fifa ordered North Korea\u2019s last qualifying match \u2013 against its old enemy Japan \u2013 to take place behind closed doors in Bangkok. \u201cI think the North Koreans tried to do something because they were angry. Not just because of the game, they were angry because of the referee, because of the federation, also they were angry at their leader.\u201d \u201cIt was an emotional reaction,\u201d said Ivankovi\u0107.             By contrast, the 1966 World Cup was a major event in North Korea\u2019s sporting history. Not only did the team qualify but they reached the quarter finals, where they defeated Italy 1- 0.  It was a historic moment, documented in the 2002 film The Game of Their Lives. The players returned home as national heroes and, as shown in the film, are still venerated in state propaganda. Football sanctions If anything goes against the idea of North Koreans as mindless automatons, meekly accepting their lot, it\u2019s the 2005 riot in Pyongyang. But what it does reveal about the politics of sport in the country is harder to establish.     It\u2019s \u200bis\u200b often treated more like fishing. I haven\u2019t seen anyone distorted in agony or ecstasy watching a game  Simon Cockerell     There\u2019s a well-established connection between authoritarian regimes and football politics. Under Saddam Hussein, members of the Iraqi football team were imprisoned and tortured for slip-ups on the field, and Qatar\u2019s 2022 successful bid for the World Cup has been marred by allegations of corruption and criticisms of the state\u2019s human rights record.  Communist regimes historically used international sports to showcase their athletic prowess, and North Korea is no exception. Mass games were a fixture of life in the eastern bloc, and the purpose of the Arirang festival in Pyongyang is to demonstrate the nation\u2019s unity and collective spirit through dramatic displays of athletics. In March, as tensions escalated once again on the Korean Peninsula the international football governing body announced it was withdrawing $1.66m in planned financial assistance to the DPRK.     The North Korean team huddle before their match against Portugal in 2010. Photograph: /flickr    It was due to be provided through Fifa\u2019s financial assistance program \u2013 which helps countries lacking the means to develop their footballing industry, but Fifa said that money had been withdrawn because of North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear proliferation efforts. \u201cSince Fifa is domiciled in Switzerland, sanctions of the Swiss [authorities] are binding,\u201d a spokesman told Radio Free Asia. \u201cDue to these sanctions, we are currently unable to transfer any money to the North Korea Football Association.\u201d The decision passed with little controversy, but offers further evidence that when it comes to sport, North Korea, like in everything else, is regarded as a pariah. Fishing not football The people of the DPRK are not immune to the pull of international sports, but despite unconfirmed reports in the British tabloid press last year that Kim Jong-un is a fan of Manchester United, North Korean fans do not display the type of devotion seen in the Premier League. The pitch invasion of 2005 seems to be the exception, not the rule. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to whip up the hysteria or mania that other footballing nations have when their teams play,\u201d said Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours, a keen football fan who has organised matches inside North Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s often treated more like fishing ... I haven\u2019t seen anyone distorted in agony or ecstasy as their team scores or lets in a goal, it just doesn\u2019t seem to bring out the intense emotions that it does elsewhere.\u201d  Korean derbys  Recently, there have also been a number of \u201cKorean derbys\u201d, with the South and North playing against each other. In the qualifying matches for the 2010 World Cup the two Koreas played each other four times, resulting in three draws and one victory for the South.  Two of the games were played in Shanghai because the North refused to allow South Korea\u2019s flag to fly in Pyongyang.   Related: Attitudes changing as North Korea gear up for Asian Cup | John Duerden    Cockrell attended the Shanghai games and described an \u201coverwhelming South Korean fan presence,\u201d and a small but vocal group of supporters for the North Korean team.

The leadership of the North Korean governing body of football, DPR Korea Football Association, includes head honchos from the military and politics. The president of the association for example, is Ri Jong-mu, who served as sports minister until April 2014, and is a lieutenant general in the Korean People\u2019s Army.  The North Korean state is also in the process of developing its \u201csports economy\u201d \u2013 a massive infrastructure project involving the construction of new stadiums, parks and ski resorts. Curtis Melvin of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University explains that many of the reasons behind the initiative are unclear, and whilst experts can only speculate, the motivations may centre around increasing loyalty from citizens rather than improving the economy.  \u201cI suspect that it is part of Kim Jong-un\u2019s stated emphasis on improving the lives of the people,\u201d he says. \u201cSports parks, children\u2019s parks, skate parks and water parks are being built all across the country.\u201d ", "tags": ["North Korea", "Football", "Asia Pacific", "Sport", "World news", "World Cup", "Football violence", "South Korea", "Sport politics"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-04T04:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/04/in-search-of-my-familys-buried-treasure-china", "sentences": ["When I arrived in Shanghai, where my 96-year-old grandmother had moved after many decades in Texas to live with one of my uncles, many of the principal characters were long dead, and those old enough to still remember the porcelain were elderly and unknown to me."], "title": "In search of my family\u2019s buried treasure", "article": "In the summer of 1938, the Japanese army landed in Jiujiang, a major trading port on the Yangtze river near my great-great-grandfather Liu Feng Shu\u2019s hometown of Xingang. As the Japanese advanced, Liu directed his workmen to dig a large hole in the garden, deeper than a man was tall and as wide as a bedroom. They lined the pit with bamboo shelving, on which they stacked the family\u2019s heirlooms: antique furniture, jade, scrolls, and Liu\u2019s prized porcelain collection, all carefully packed in straw. The men laboured after dark, filling the vault to its brim before covering it with a false floor and replanting the vegetation on top.     Liu Feng Shu with one of his grandsons in the 1930s.    One night in July, shortly after the burials were completed, a raggedy Chinese soldier knocked on the door and asked for something to eat. After Liu took him in and fed him, the soldier said, \u201cWhy have you not left yet? The city has fallen. The Japanese are here.\u201d The next morning, my great-great-grandfather and his family stuffed as much jewellery and silver as they could fit in their pockets and bundled their clothes in knapsacks. They barricaded the heavy front doors and fled for Sichuan province, where the Chinese army had retreated, leaving behind the buried treasure. Liu had been born to a modest, landowning family as China\u2019s last imperial dynasty \u2013 the Qing \u2013 was crumbling. Though he earned the second-highest score on the district-level imperial civil service examination, he declined a government position, instead returning to his village of Xingang, where he established a private school and invested his earnings in land. In the tradition of Chinese scholar-gentry, Liu patronised the arts and collected porcelain by the crate. He filled his house with vases of every shape and size, decorative plates, figurines of Buddhist gods, tableware, and dowries for his five granddaughters. The collection supposedly included valuable imperial wares. The family lived a wealthy, comfortable existence in post-imperial, Republican China. Though a staunch Confucian, Liu had his sons study at engineering colleges and, at a time when women often didn\u2019t even receive names, sent his granddaughters to a nearby Methodist boarding school where they learned English and received western educations; my grandmother was not the first woman in the family to earn a college degree. The family summered on nearby Mount Lu in Guling, the missionary retreat established by an Englishman, Edward Selby Little, their villa sitting across a small stream from that of the Chinese military and political leader Chiang Kai-shek. Occasionally, the girls would see the generalissimo out on his evening walk. \u201cHello, Mr President,\u201d they said as he passed by. Chiang would wave and warn them to be careful around the water. If my parents told me about Liu and his buried porcelain, it never registered. Growing up in Utah, I paid little attention to family stories, most of which concerned overcoming hardships that I, preoccupied with overcoming my own hardship of being Chinese and non-Mormon in Salt Lake City, couldn\u2019t relate to and didn\u2019t care to hear about. As far as I was concerned, the Chinese people in my life, with their loud, angry-sounding manner of speaking and odd habits, were from another planet and had travelled to Earth for the sole purpose of embarrassing me. By the time I went to China to look for my great-great-grandfather\u2019s porcelain, armed with little more than strands of a family legend, I still had far more questions than answers. How much porcelain and silver was buried? Were there really imperial pieces in the collection? Where was the old family house? Did it still belong to us? Had anyone ever tried to recover the porcelain? What happened to it? But my family\u2019s long march had splintered it over thousands of miles and two continents, an estrangement that hardened when the Communists took the mainland in 1949. My grandmother, the oldest of her generation and a chemist working in a Kuomintang research laboratory, and her cousin, married to a high-ranking Kuomintang officer, fled to Taiwan. My grandmother\u2019s family eventually resettled in the US. The rest of their family \u2013 sisters, cousins, my great-great-grandfather \u2013 stayed behind in China, and for decades neither side knew anything about the other. When I arrived in Shanghai, where my 96-year-old grandmother had moved after many decades in Texas to live with one of my uncles, many of the principal characters were long dead, and those old enough to still remember the porcelain were elderly and unknown to me. I soon learned that when the porcelain was buried, my grandmother had already graduated from Ginling women\u2019s college in Nanjing (just months before the Rape of Nanking) and headed south to teach at a missionary school in Guangzhou, and then Macau. Though Macau remained a safe haven for most of the war, food shortages after Hong Kong fell in 1941 forced my grandmother into her own harrowing trek back to Chongqing, China\u2019s wartime capital. Though her memory remained impressively sharp, she preferred the family history to remain buried. The old fears and grudges \u2013 including against Liu, who had prevented her from pursuing her desired medical studies \u2013 from the wars and dislocations had ossified over time, and she discouraged me from seeking out other relations. Navigating family mores was nothing like navigating China, which unfolded relatively easily once I relearned the Chinese that I had forgotten. But through a mixture of patience, persistence, and felicitous timing, I eventually arranged to visit my grandmother\u2019s cousin in Taiwan, Liu Pei Yu, who had remained close to their grandfather and had helped with the burials. She turned out to be as chatty as my grandmother was reticent. As the widow of a Kuomintang military officer, her loyalties were clear. In her stories, the Kuomintang were the noble heroes, while the Communists are \u201cred bandits\u201d, \u201cghouls\u201d or \u201cbastards\u201d, the Communist sympathisers in the family were \u201ctraitors\u201d, and she gave dates as \u201cthe nth year of the Republic of China\u201d. From her, I learned about Liu\u2019s scholarly achievements, the small empire he built in Xingang, the respect he commanded from the villagers, his heroism in taking his family to safety during the war, and how he died in 1951 after being kicked out of his house and forced to live in a pigsty by the Communists. She even had a box of photographs from her childhood, my first real glimpses of a time that, until then, had been more myth than reality. But she could only speculate about the fate of that buried porcelain, as the Sino-Japanese war was just the start of a series of catastrophes for the country, and when she returned to see her hometown well after the cultural revolution, it was so changed she could barely locate Liu\u2019s house. By then, everything belonged to the government, anyway. Back on the mainland, I rushed to visit the remaining relations while I still could, a winding journey punctuated by dinner meetings with Chinese officials, altercations with reckless drivers, a frantic night searching for a rabies clinic in Jingdezhen, numerous illnesses, and plenty of wild goose chases. These were relations whom I had not even known existed, much less been familiar with their stories. And yet they welcomed me, the first of my generation to seek them out, with an unexpected warmth.     Huan Hsu, who journeyed to China in search of his great-great-grandfather\u2019s buried treasure. Photograph: Martijn van Nieuwenhuyzen    In Beijing, I met my grandmother\u2019s youngest sister, Liu Pei Sheng, whose vivacity made it hard to believe she had suffered a stroke a few years ago. Her memory faded in and out, and I tried my best to coax clues from her. Her husband, on the other hand, a retired academic, could not have been more lucid. An American-educated metallurgist, he had been tapped for China\u2019s nuclear programme in 1956, and for nearly two decades worked on an arid plateau in western Qinghai province running experiments. When the country began devouring itself during the cultural revolution, his position was such that he was singled out for torture, physical and psychological. His children were sent to the countryside for \u201cre-education\u201d and locked out of universities. Somehow, despite all the murders and suicides around him, he survived, and he recounted it all with remarkable equanimity. But they could tell me little about the porcelain, so I went north to Jinan, in China\u2019s agricultural heartland, to find the only male of my grandmother\u2019s generation, who would have inherited my great-great-grandfather\u2019s estate. Liu Cong Ji had also stayed on the mainland after the Communist victory, and, like everyone, had paid the price for his bourgeois background. His father, the only one of my great-great grandfather\u2019s three sons to survive the war, was terrorised so unrelentingly during one of Mao\u2019s campaigns that he killed himself. Liu Cong Ji showed me the only photograph of my great-great-grandfather that my family owned. Once I made my way back to Xingang, still home to the Liu family cemetery, where my great-great-grandfather was buried, I could hardly keep up with all the relations I was introduced to, including the keeper of the jia pu, the recorded genealogy stretching back more than a dozen generations. By then, my journey had become more than a search for clues to lost treasure. It was a race to preserve stories before they, too, were lost, an accretion of the memories and piecing back together of the narratives that were far more fragile than porcelain. And the journalist in me couldn\u2019t help testing and corroborating the information I had heard. A native term for overseas Chinese is huaqiao. Hua means \u201cChinese\u201d and qiao is a homonym for \u201cbridge\u201d. When I first heard the term, I imagined myself stretched across the Pacific Ocean with my head in America and my feet in China (or vice versa, a fitting confusion for an American-born Chinese), getting trampled on by people from both sides. But as I untangled the antecedents to my return to my ancestral home, I was reminded that being a huaqiao had also revealed a new world that I, by an accident of birth, could explore with as much or as little confrontation as I chose. And that I could spend the rest of my life tracing my roots through that world. I began to understand the concept of a huaqiao not as a burden but a privilege. Truth is a shifty thing in families. I had hoped to find consensus, a unified theory that captured and explained the entire history of the Lius. Instead, each relation had his or her own version of events, often cast in light of their personal experiences, biases and insecurities. Liu Pei Yu, my grandmother\u2019s cousin in Taiwan, remembered the porcelain collection having been as vast as it was valuable. Her cousin Liu Cong Ji on the mainland described it as nothing special, of mostly sentimental value. Were her memories gilded by a life spent in exile? And had he changed his in order to survive movement after movement targeting the gentry and intelligentsia? In the end, the truth is whatever you choose to believe. Yet I was surprised at how much turned out just like my family had said. After three years of searching for Liu\u2019s buried porcelain collection, I found myself squeezed into a black Mazda with distant relations, cruising along the Yangtze river to Xingang. The village was indeed a half-day\u2019s walk east of Jiujiang, the port city where my grandmother and her sisters had attended boarding school, which still stood. The fields along the river that had belonged to Liu were as expansive as my relations described. After we made a left at the main intersection, wound around a gentle, inclined turn, and stopped before a tall metal gate, I saw that his estate really had been converted into a cotton factory after it was \u201cliberated\u201d by the Communists. The factory looked as if it had been abandoned for years, the lock on its gate rusted shut. Weeds pushed up between the seams of the concrete courtyard around which long brick buildings were arranged. Grass and bushes grew wild on the vacant, northern end. We found a rickety ladder made of scrap wood leaning against the wall, and moments later I was standing on my great-great-grandfather\u2019s old property. We walked into the overgrowth, my grandmother\u2019s local cousin, whom I called Uncle Tang, holding his arms before him like divining rods. The air buzzed with cicadas. \u201cThe washroom was over there, I think,\u201d he said, motioning for me to follow him to a small clearing. \u201cThere was a big cistern we used for baths.\u201d \u201cAnd over there was the kitchen,\u201d he said, pointing to another area. He put one palm against his head and thought. \u201cThat retaining wall used to run all the way along the property. That means the garden would have been \u2026\u201d He led me to another spot where someone had planted a few rows of wilted vegetables. \u201c\u2026 about here.\u201d Uncle Tang pointed at the ground. \u201cThis is it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is probably where they buried the porcelain.\u201d We looked, but it turned out not to be the place, and so the search continued. But I had closed the circle. Somewhere near where I stood, on this very patch of land, my great-great-grandfather had breathed the same air and dug the same earth. And I realised that no matter what I might find, I\u2019d already discovered heirlooms far more valuable and enduring than Liu\u2019s buried treasure: my family. \u2022 The Porcelain Thief by Huan Hsu is published by Fourth Estate, \u00a316.99.

But Longbridge is on its way back", "article": "For a 100 years the name Longbridge cast its shadow across Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry. Throughout a century when the ability to make motor cars defined an economy\u2019s industrial clout, the plant \u2013 brainchild of one of Britain\u2019s automotive pioneers, Herbert Austin \u2013 was a standard bearer of British-owned volume car production. Ten years ago this week, however, production ground to a halt and more than 6,000 workers at the Birmingham plant and many others in the region lost their jobs. The end came on 8 April, when MG Rover went into administration after failing to secure a rescue partnership with Chinese state-owned carmaker the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC). Today, a new town is emerging from the sprawling 468-acre site as part of a \u00a31bn regeneration programme, one of the biggest in Britain, which could take another decade or more to complete. The UK automotive industry is also motoring. In a single week at the end of March, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Geely, the Chinese owner of the London Taxi Company, announced combined investments of more than \u00a31bn at their UK factories. By the time the Longbridge project is finished, St Modwen, the property company that is redeveloping the site, says it will provide 10,000 jobs (more than 3,500 have already arrived), 2,000 new homes, a town centre (Sainsbury\u2019s has already moved in; M&amp;S is on the way), schools, leisure facilities and almost 2\u00a0million square feet of offices, distribution and industrial space, including an innovation centre and technology park. The old engine plant is now a housing development, and work has begun on a retirement village. A park has replaced a press shop and there is even a creche \u2013 a surprising survivor from carmaking days.     An Austin 10 being assembled at Longbridge in 1945. Photograph: William Vanderson/Getty Images    Unemployment in the area has fallen to around or below pre-Rover-crash levels. But Richard Halstead, Midlands regional director of manufacturers\u2019 group the EEF, says it was more than a question of jobs. The impact was also felt, he says, in ways not captured by the raw unemployment figures: \u201cThere was a big impact on the perception of the sector and on careers in the sector. The perception was that manufacturing was not a place you wanted to develop a career.\u201d In a region where the skills base had already been hit by contractions over previous years, that was a serious blow, and one which is still being felt. As manufacturing recovers from the post-crisis recession, Halstead notes that the three main preoccupations of his members are: \u201cSkills, skills, skills.\u201d Richard Burden, long-serving Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, is another who believes that, damaging as the closure was for the local economy, its impact went deeper: \u201cLongbridge was part of the way people defined themselves. It was part of their identity. What happened went to the core of that: what the plant was, what the community was, what their future was, what their children\u2019s futures would be.\u201d Mike Murray, senior development surveyor at St Modwen, who leads the regeneration programme, is also insistent that Longbridge must be more than bricks, mortar and the latest in global communication links. The aim is to create a community to replace the one that, over the years, had grown up around the car plant: \u201cWhat we are doing is putting the heart back into Longbridge.\u201d     The West Works, part of the site, seen in the process of being demolished. Photograph: John James/Alamy    It is generally accepted that achieving this ambition has been helped along by a steady development of new homes and jobs. The most visible sign of life is the arrival of the Bournville College and its \u00a366m facility, which brings a daily influx of students. Longbridge\u2019s automotive past has not been entirely swept away. While it was the collapse of a deal with a Chinese backer that sealed Rover\u2019s fate, China did not turn its back on Birmingham. After the closure, part of the plant was bought by Nanjing Automotive \u2013 which in 2007 was essentially taken over by SAIC, the company that had failed to become Rover\u2019s saviour. The group has chosen to place its UK research and development at the Longbridge facility, which now employs more than 400 people on design and engineering work. Motor manufacturing began again in 2008, with a small production line building MG sports cars. Sir Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council, acknowledges that, after the crisis triggered by the closure of Longbridge, he is relieved at the way events are unfolding. Development of the site is an integral part of the council\u2019s overall economic plan, but it goes beyond that: \u201cWhat we have is something that can call itself Longbridge, which is clearly identified, not with a single manufacturing plant\u2026 but with housing, retail, job opportunities, further education and so on. We have a new Longbridge emerging.\u201d The demise of MG Rover and the closure of Longbridge were widely seen as yet another stage in the slow decline of Britain\u2019s automotive industry. Indeed for many it was hard to see how things could get worse. In 2004, the year before Rover closed its doors, Britain produced 1.65m passenger cars. The following year, even without Rover, it made 1.6m. In 2009, in the downturn following the global banking crisis, however, production slumped, with UK car plants turning out just 1m vehicles. Though there were fears that Britain could face further closures, the main carmakers \u2013 Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Vauxhall, Mini and Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 hung on in, though not, in some cases, without painful cuts. Their faith in UK manufacturing capability was rewarded. Demand picked up and production recovered. By last year, according to motor industry body the SMMT, car production had topped 1.528m vehicles in the best year since 2007. Though sales to the European Union, a key market for UK marques, were hard hit, exports to destinations including China, Russia and the US helped boost demand. Britain now exports four out of every five cars it builds. In the first three months of 2012, for example, the UK clocked up a positive balance of payments in cars for the first time since 1976, meaning the country earned more from selling vehicles abroad than it spent on importing them. At the same time, sales in the UK have soared as motorists make the best of low interest rates or opt for personal contract hire plans that allow the user to lease their car for a set period, then trade it in for a newer model. With strong demand at home and exports thriving, there are even suggestions that Britain\u2019s carmakers could raise output levels to 2m within the next few years.

Photograph: PA    In the past two years, more than \u00a37bn has been invested in UK car production facilities, with several new models coming on stream. Last month Jaguar Land Rover announced plans to spend \u00a3600m at its West Midlands site, including \u00a3450m for the manufacture of the Jaguar-XF aluminium-bodied car in Castle Bromwich. In Coventry, the company plans to double the size of its headquarters, adding a centre for research and advanced engineering. The expansion could indirectly create between 7,000 and 11,000 more jobs through the supply chain, and involves the purchase of a 62-acre site. In another boost for Coventry, Geely unveiled plans to create 1,000 jobs at a \u00a3250m plant building low-emission black cabs. Then Honda secured the future of its Swindon factory with a \u00a3200m investment in making a five-door version of its Civic hatchback, one of its most popular European models. Honda had cut jobs and production at Swindon two years ago, but the news has laid to rest fears the plant could be mothballed. Honda\u2019s head of European operations, Toshiaki Mikoshiba, has unveiled four new models for the European market and says that the company has a \u201crenewed optimism and purpose in Europe\u201d. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, declared that it had been \u201ca fantastic week for UK automotive\u201d. There was, he said, no precedent for as much investment in the industry in such a short period. \u201cUK car manufacturing is now more diverse than ever, with a unique combination of volume, premium and specialist brands giving our products truly global appeal.\u201d Back at Longbridge, the last Austin Metro rolled off the production line a long time ago, but the name of British motoring\u2019s founding father lives on in the newly created Austin Park. Here the river Rea, which had been buried in a culvert to make way for industrial development, has been brought back to the surface. Illuminated for a festival of light last October, it runs all the way to Birmingham city centre and has caught the eye of a new generation of town planners, who are wondering whether a cycle route linking the centre to the suburbs might help to transform a very car-centric city. At Longbridge, that transformation is already well under way. Longbridge\u2019s history: Red Robbo, Shanghai and the Phoenix Four     Workers leaving MG Rover after the Phoenix Four collapse. Photograph: Brian Bould/Daily Mail/Rex    Situated between urban Birmingham and the picturesque Lickey hills, Longbridge had always been unashamedly industrial; a pioneering car plant, a wartime munitions maker, a driving force for the local economy and beyond. That has made it a political nightmare for generations of politicians terrified of losing the jobs it represents, either directly or through the tentacles of its supply chain. It was an industrial, as well as a political, battleground, where Longbridge union convenor Derek \u201cRed Robbo\u201d Robinson clashed repeatedly with British Leyland\u2019s acerbic South African boss Sir Michael Edwardes \u2013 whose empire included Longbridge \u2013 in the late 1970s and early\u00a01980s. In 1988 an exasperated Thatcher government eventually sold Rover \u2013 as British Leyland had subsequently become \u2013 to British Aerospace who, just six years later, passed it to Germany\u2019s BMW. Fast-forward another six years and BMW had also had enough. The German carmaker\u2019s owners, the Quandt family, had become increasingly concerned by the losses being clocked up at the \u201cEnglish patient\u201d. Rover had to go. Land Rover was snapped up by Ford \u2013 which had bought Jaguar a decade earlier \u2013 but the bulk of the operation, including Longbridge, was sold to Phoenix Venture Holdings, a consortium of four businessmen: John Towers, John Edwards, Peter Beale and Nick Stephenson. Quickly dubbed the \u201cPhoenix Four\u201d, they promised to maintain volume manufacturing. BMW paid heavily for the Phoenix Four to take the business off its hands, bestowing what amounted to a \u00a3475m \u201cdowry\u201d on the company in exchange for a nominal sum. But if BMW was desperate to unload Longbridge, it was careful to keep the Mini, with production switching from the West Midlands to Cowley in exchange for Rover 75 production . The relief that greeted the Phoenix deal did not last long. The consortium\u2019s plan was that MG Rover Group, as the new carmaker was named, would build 200,000 cars a year at Longbridge \u2013 a target that was to prove elusive. Phoenix was no more successful in finding the international partner Rover needed to secure its long term future than anyone else had been. A string of possible candidates came and went before, in spring 2004, negotiations began with a state-owned Chinese carmaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. Talks dragged on for almost a year as SAIC became increasingly concerned about the long term viability of its would-be partner, as well as the potential redundancy and pension liabilities with which it might be saddled. Without the cash from a joint venture, Rover was running out of road. Last-ditch support from Downing Street and a possible \u00a3110m bridging loan failed to reassure SAIC. By Thursday 7 April 2005, and despite frantic efforts, MG Rover\u2019s board decided\u00a0to seek advice on the \u201cprobable imminent administration\u201d of the group and the next day officially went into administration, leaving more than 6,000 workers without jobs and Rover\u2019s creditors owed almost \u00a31.3bn. In the wake of the closure, unemployment in the immediate Longbridge area doubled over the next five years. Adjacent Northfield and the wider Birmingham area showed sharp increases in joblessness over the same period. It could have been even worse: many Rover suppliers, alerted by what happened in 2000 when BMW sold out, had used the following five years to reduce their dependence on the plant. The collapse triggered an outburst of anger and recrimination, mainly directed at the Phoenix Four, some of which is still felt today. It took Department of Trade and Industry inspectors four years to untangle what had happened. Unsurprisingly, their report was critical of the Phoenix Four, not least because during their stewardship they had become multimillionaires despite the group\u2019s demise, receiving \u201clarge, and we say unreasonably large, financial rewards totalling tens of millions of pounds\u201d, according to the inspectors. Two years later, all four men were disqualified from being company directors for varying periods. Richard Burden, the Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield then and now, still believes the Phoenix Four owe a debt to the workforce: \u201cWe are still saying to the Phoenix Four they should provide some recognition\u2026 putting their hands in their pockets. It would help people to move on, to have closure on the closure.\u201d", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Jaguar Land Rover", "Automotive industry", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-04T15:00:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/05/music-enhance-enjoyment-wine-food", "sentences": ["\u201cWe find that when our team has a strange result in tasting, it corresponds to a moment in the lunar calendar.\u201d I should have known batter: the perfect accompaniments     British food on a union jack table at Ultraviolet in Shanghai.", "Photograph: Carlos Barria /Reuters    Fish and chips Shanghai restaurant Ultraviolet serves its version against a backdrop of Beatles music as a union flag is projected on to the surface of the table."], "title": "Melody on the menu: how a sprinkle of Mozart might give your meal zing", "article": "Professor Charles Spence is trying to come up with a sound for salty. \u201cWe are not quite there yet,\u201d says the Oxford academic. \u201cBitter, sweet, sour \u2013 we have those. But salty is the hardest taste to embody in sound.\u201d Spence, a behavioural psychologist, spends his life finding out how music, colour and even the weight of cutlery used in a restaurant can be used to enhance the enjoyment of both wine and food. Pure taste is not nearly as dominant as we may think when judging a meal, he says. Play the right music to diners and the pleasure they derive from drinking and eating can be greatly enhanced. Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal is among restaurateurs who have sought the professor\u2019s advice, applying the lessons learned to the Michelin-spangled Fat Duck at Bray, Berkshire. It is just the beginning of a trend that could see music being adopted as an integral part of the menu. Wine experts say that taste, smell and sight are the senses that count when judging the contents of a bottle, but Spence believes what you hear is important, too. Combine Tchaikovsky or Bryan Ferry with the right bottle and you will have a much better night out. Musical pairing recognises that our senses play off each other in ways that we do not yet fully comprehend \u2013 that our ears unconsciously inform our taste buds. When sommeliers talk of high or low notes in wine, they may actually be on to something.     Mozart: an ideal adornment for Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. Photograph: De Agostini/Getty    \u201cCan we capture aromas or bouquet musically?\u201d asks Spence. \u201cComposers around the world are working on this. Are wine writers merely filling column inches with this use of the musical metaphor or are they picking up on some underlying truth? We think they are.\u201d Humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes. Sourness is high-pitched, while sweetness is associated with richer, more rounded sounds. Bitterness is expressed in deeper, more mordant tones. Salty, however, is tricky. Spence and his team think it\u2019s something like a throbbing sound, but the version they use in tests doesn\u2019t convince. \u201cWe have found that people can experience 15% more pleasure if music matches the wine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an exciting area: how soundscapes come together with taste to make the whole experience more enjoyable \u2026 It\u2019s a kind of digital seasoning.\u201d Spence is speaking in Berlin as a guest of the champagne house Krug, which wants to use music to enhance the enjoyment of its luxurious and pricey product. To this end, it has created an app matching champagnes from particular years with music. Ferry and the jazz pianist Jacky Terrasson are among those recruited by Krug to create the musical accompaniments. Apparently Terrasson\u2019s brand of free-form jazz is ideal when downing Krug Grande Cuv\u00e9e 2003. Spence is confident of his findings and cites a study in which Tchaikovsky\u2019s String Quartet No 1 in D Major turned out to be a very good match for Ch\u00e2teau Margaux 2004. Mozart\u2019s Flute Quartet in D Major, meanwhile, was found to be the ideal adornment for Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 \u2013with drinkers enjoying their wine more when \u201cpaired\u201d music was played more than in periods of silence. To demonstrate how musical tones influences taste, Spence stages a test in Berlin. People are given chocolate to eat and two pieces of classical music are played \u2013 one sombre, one lighter. Most of those tested reported that the chocolate eaten during the sombre music was more bitter, while that consumed during the lighter music tasted sweeter. \u201cTinkling music \u2013 high-pitched piano \u2013 draws people\u2019s attention to something in chocolate,\u201d explains Spence. \u201cMusic cannot create tastes or flavours that are not there in your mouth, but it can draw attention to certain notes in a wine or food that are competing in your mind.\u201d    Tinkling music \u2013 high-pitched piano \u2013 draws people\u2019s attention to something in chocolate  Professor Charles Spence     But how would musical pairing work in a crowded restaurant where people are eating and drinking different things at the same time? The answer is a hyper-directional speaker, a \u201csound shower\u201d that beams music vertically down on to the table and cannot be heard by people even a short distance away. Colour can play just as important a role as sound in food and wine appreciation. Tests conducted on 3,000 people attending an event in London have demonstrated how ambient light can enhance flavour. Red wine drunk in red light is reported to be fruitier than in normal light, while green light can enhance sourness. \u201cWe tested the four best wine experts in the Alicante region and fooled them all by colouring white wine red,\u201d says Spence. \u201cAs experts, they are more likely to be fooled because the colour gives them expectations \u2013 of what they know about that colour. Likewise, chefs are more likely to be fooled than ordinary people by changing the sound of food because they use sound to judge freshness more than ordinary people do.\u201d Does this mean that quality in food and wine is a myth, that perception can be skewed easily by sound or colour or even packaging? \u201cPeople will always know when something is bad,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide the fact that a fish has gone off. But you can make something good even better.\u201d Branding has an effect all of its own. Research at Oxford shows that when people encounter luxury items the pleasure centres in their brain light up. They are not pretending to enjoy an elite product \u2013 they are truly aroused by it. Snobbery is not merely social but physical. Labelling works. Eric Lebel is the man Krug relies on to ensure quality. Each year he drives around the Champagne region of France selecting grapes for his employer, tasting them on the hillsides. Krug does not aim for the occasional great vintage, preferring consistency, year in year out, irrespective of weather. Lebel and his team are charged with ensuring that consistency, and their decisions can make or break the reputation of a great house. What does he think affects taste? \u201cThe moon can,\u201d he offers, nonchalantly. \u201cWe find that when our team has a strange result in tasting, it corresponds to a moment in the lunar calendar.\u201d I should have known batter: the perfect accompaniments     British food on a union jack table at Ultraviolet in Shanghai.

These days almost 2m cars clutter up the sprawling city\u2019s thoroughfares. \u201cAt 9am we\u2019re already bumper-to-bumper,\u201d says Zhu, at the wheel of his C-Elysee, one of the models manufactured locally by Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen. Wuhan, population 10 million, is a transport hub, and dreams of becoming the car city of the People\u2019s Republic. The automobile industry represents 20% of the city\u2019s economy, with 200,000 direct jobs and more than a million indirectly. And Wuhan\u2019s car industry is growing fast. General Motors and its Chinese partner, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, have launched a new plant capable of producing 240,000 vehicles annually. At the end of this year Renault will be rolling out an assembly unit. With the plants operated by the Dongfeng-PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn joint venture and Honda, among others, the provincial capital will soon have about 10 car factories, producing more than 2m vehicles a year, in an area smaller than the Paris basin. In 2014 Wuhan was the world\u2019s seventh-largest centre of automobile production, with 1.13m vehicles assembled, although Chongqing, which assembled 2.3m vehicles last year, tops the global rankings. The most visible impact of this development is the congestion. Corinne Policisto, who works for Renault, first came to what seemed a pretty drab place in 1988. Returning in 2013, she was bewildered. \u201cWhen I visited my old stamping ground near the university, it had all changed. In those days I could cycle around at 2am but I wouldn\u2019t dare now, the traffic\u2019s so crazy.\u201d Like much of the rest of China, Wuhan is seemingly one huge building site. In one direction a new development with 10 towers is going up, in the other an elevated urban highway. Not far off there is a new overground railway and beyond a vast mall. Not to mention thousands of homes. There are currently 11,000 building sites in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s been chaos since they started building the subway five years ago,\u201d Zhu says. In December 2014 a fourth new line opened and the city council has promised that by 2020 there will be 12. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much change in the 2000s,\u201d says Liu Yi, a young PSA executive. \u201cBut in 2010 it all speeded up, with Beijing driving development.\u201d Wuhan cannot compete with the big cities on the coast, despite its efforts, but it has a prominent place in Chinese history. In the early 20th century the revolt that overthrew the Qing dynasty started here. During the war against Japan the town became a rear base for the authorities, and Mao Zedong liked to swim in the Blue river.     Employees inspect a C-Elysee in a plant operated by Dongfeng Peugeot Citroen in Wuhan, in Hubei province.  Photograph: Shepherd Zhou/EPA    His successors launched the great offensive to give the country its own car industry. \u201cThe objective was to develop six large firms,\u201d says Yin Xinmin, professor of economics at Fudan University, Shanghai. \u201cTo develop the automobile, it was necessary to create everything that gravitated around it. Hubei, with its capital Wuhan, was an ideal candidate, being one of the earliest industrial centres in China. The region is well-connected, thanks in particular to the Yangtze river.\u201d Second Automotive Works, which changed its name to Dongfeng in 1992, set up shop in Shiyan, in the mountains of Hubei, 450km from Wuhan. In 1990 the company started a joint venture with Citro\u00ebn, opting to build its first civilian car plant at Wuhan, which was more accessible than Shiyan. Only in 2005 did Dongfeng move its headquarters to the city, by which time it was working with PSA, Honda, Nissan and Renault, giving ideas to the increasingly ambitious local authorities. \u201cEvery city needs a champion. Wuhan stands out because Dongfeng is involved in more joint ventures with foreign firms than the other state-owned organisations,\u201d says Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dufour, at the consultants DCA. \u201cIt\u2019s an important company in China and it carries quite a lot of weight. For the local authorities, local manufacturers are crucial. It\u2019s a matter of prestige, a source of potential revenue and above all jobs.\u201d To the west of the city, the economic and technological development zone hinges on \u201cDongfeng city\u201d. The firm has given its name to all the streets round the head office: Dongfeng Road 1, 2, 3 and so on. There are six car factories in the vicinity, operated by PSA, Honda and, of course, Dongfeng. \u201cDongfeng is looking out for us,\u201d says Zhu. What with the workers on the assembly lines, in the hospitals, sports centres and housing complexes, everything in this part of Wuhan is Dongfeng. \u201cThey\u2019re good employers, too,\u201d Liu says. \u201cThe health cover and pensions are better than other companies.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have this firm here,\u201d Zhu says. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of work and that brings in trade. Without them the city would never have developed so quickly. And you know, Xu Ping, the Dongfeng boss, is more important than the head of the city council.\u201d The provincial capital is also one of China\u2019s largest university towns, with 1.3 million students. So there is a steady stream of eager young technicians and engineers. Labour costs are lower than on the coast too. \u201cFor a long time the economy was a bit sluggish,\u201d says the local head of a French equipment manufacturer. \u201cBut now it\u2019s catching up lost time.\u201d This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Automotive industry", "Peugeot", "Citro\u00ebn", "Business", "Toyota", "Manufacturing sector"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-06T14:17:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/08/can-world-economy-survive-without-fossil-fuels", "sentences": ["The size of the global middle class has increased, and consumers in Shanghai and Mumbai have been able to afford cars and fridge-freezers."], "title": "Can the world economy survive without fossil fuels? | Larry Elliott", "article": "The final chapters of The Bone Clocks, David Mitchell\u2019s 2014 novel, describe a future in which progress has gone into reverse. In 2043, the fossil fuel age is over: nuclear power stations ar e melting down, there is no access to the electricity grid and solar panels are so prized that they are looted. Catastrophic climate change has become a reality. Rising sea levels have caused floods on the New York City subway, killing thousands. Internet coverage is patchy, food and consumer goods are scarce, and life\u2011saving drugs such as insulin are hard to come by. It is a dystopian vision that looks like a brutal, dangerous version of the past \u2013 one not at all like the future that was promised when the cold war ended with victory for the western capitalist model. If it comes to pass, it will be because, despite all the warnings, climate change has not been taken seriously enough. Here is one such warning: \u201cFor generations, we have assumed that the efforts of mankind would leave the fundamental equilibrium of the world\u2019s systems and atmosphere stable. But it is possible that with all these enormous changes \u2013 population, agricultural, use of fossil fuels \u2013 concentrated into such a short period of time, we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself.\u201d That was Margaret Thatcher, in a speech to Britain\u2019s scientific elite in 1988. Thatcher was no climate change denier. She told the Royal Society that her government supported the idea of sustainable economic development, and concluded: \u201cStable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world, provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded. Protecting this balance of nature is therefore one of the great challenges of the late 20th century.\u201d   Related: Faith in fossil fuel divestment | Letters    It was, though, just one speech at a time of great global upheaval: China was liberalising its economy; apartheid was in its death throes in South Africa; above all, the cold war was coming to an end with defeat for the Soviet Union. \u201cWe know what works,\u201d US president George HW Bush said at the time. \u201cFree markets work.\u201d   Climate change campaign sign up   The market model spread quickly to parts of the world that previously it could not touch: to China, where the reforms begun by Deng Xiaoping were accelerated; to India, where the idea that the world\u2019s biggest democracy could go it alone was abandoned; to the Soviet Union and its former satellites, which received a strong dose of economic shock treatment. Within five years, the reach of the market economy had been extended to an additional 3 billion people. Some places remained off limits. Cuba, subject to a US economic embargo, was one such country. After decades of relying on Moscow for oil, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and a large chunk of its food, Fidel Castro\u2019s government faced a crisis. The economy shrank and strict food rationing was imposed. There was an acute shortage of fuel for tractors. Calorie intake fell by a third. The Cuban government responded by creating urban farms: agriculture went local, small scale and \u2013 by necessity \u2013 organic. Food production became less oil-intensive, as every possible scrap of land was exploited. If the denouement of Mitchell\u2019s novel presents one frightening future, Cuba provides another sketch of what could be in store if the transition from a fossil fuel world to one running on renewable energy does not go according to plan \u2013 less apocalyptic than The Bone Clocks, but with considerable drawbacks. The grow-your-own drive has only been partially successful: a quarter of a century later, food is still rationed in Cuba. Most of the world has gone in a different direction. In the west, there was a long economic boom that lasted from the early 1990s through to the financial crash of 2007. Growth rates in the developed world, however, were dwarfed by those in some of the bigger emerging economies. After the crash, when the developed world was struggling to emerge from the deepest slump since the Great Depression, it was China and India that acted as the engines of growth. In terms of reducing the number of people living below the global poverty line of $1.25 (84p) a day, the post-cold war model of capitalism has been a success. Fewer people go hungry. More have access to healthcare and education. The size of the global middle class has increased, and consumers in Shanghai and Mumbai have been able to afford cars and fridge-freezers.       Photograph: Alamy    But this process has had two unattractive side effects. The first is that the balance of power in the workplace has tilted decisively in favour of capital over labour: with an abundance of cheap workers to choose from, employers can be mean with pay. The second is that the triumph of the market has put pressure on the planet, just as Thatcher suspected it might. As the west outsourced its manufacturing to low-cost centres in Asia, energy demand in China, India and Indonesia rocketed. Globalisation means that people in the developing world know how we live in the west and they want some of what we have. In addition to higher consumer spending, that also means higher demand for energy, the bulk of which comes from fossil fuels. China currently builds a new coal-fired power station every two weeks. Burning fossil fuels puts carbon into the atmosphere, and the overwhelming view of scientists is that this leads to a buildup of greenhouse gases that results in global warming. To have a realistic prospect of preventing global temperatures from rising by more than the previously recognised danger threshold of 2C, scientists say it is not possible to burn all the proven fossil fuel reserves owned by companies and governments. Between two-thirds and four-fifths will need to be left in the ground.    In terms of reducing global poverty capitalism has been a success, but this growth has put pressure on the planet    The question, therefore, is whether it is possible to marry two seemingly contradictory objectives. Can we imagine a future that is cleaner, greener and sustainable \u2013 one that avoids climate armageddon \u2013 without abandoning the idea of growth and, thus, forcing living standards into decline? The answer is that it will be hellishly difficult, but it is just about feasible if we make the right choices \u2013 and start making them now. * * * Slowly, those in power are beginning to understand what is at stake: that if we carry on growing the global economy at its current rate, and continue to rely on fossil fuels to power that growth, the planet is going to cook. Not everybody buys into this narrative, of course. One of the challenges faced by those who wish to curtail fossil fuel use is that there is no political consensus on tackling climate change. The business-as-usual camp says that the scientific consensus is wrong about climate change, or that climate scientists have exaggerated the risks, which can be tackled if and when they become apparent. But Barack Obama does not think that way, and nor does China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, which is why they signed a deal in November 2014 setting targets for CO2 emissions up to 2030. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, does not believe it either, which is why he went public at the 2014 annual meeting of the World Bank with his view that the \u201cvast majority of fossil fuel reserves are unburnable\u201d if we wish to keep the increase in global temperatures below 2C.       Photograph: Getty    With the world barely recovered from one global recession, policymakers are now concerned about another. The talk at meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the G20 is whether the next financial crash will be caused by the pricking of the carbon bubble \u2013 the idea that the stock-market valuation of fossil fuel companies has been inflated by overestimating the worth of reserves of oil, coal and gas that could only be exploited by putting the climate at risk. In the unlikely event that investors all pulled out of fossil fuels at once, the result would be much worse than what followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 \u2013 a colossal stock market crash, followed by an equally epic slump. The Bank of England is sufficiently concerned to have launched an investigation into the risks of this happening. The odds are still against such a financial market meltdown. In part, that is because investors will probably move slowly. In part, it is because the reserves of the big western fossil fuel companies make up only a small chunk of the global total, and it is hard to see Vladimir Putin being too troubled by a divestment campaign. But the risk is now out there \u2013 and growing \u2013 because policymakers have now woken up to the risks of climate change. \u201cThere have been two terrible realisations,\u201d says Michael Jacobs, who used to advise Gordon Brown on the issue. \u201cWe have started too late, and it doesn\u2019t matter how much solar and wind power there is \u2013 you are still burning all the coal, oil and gas. Even if you do so more slowly, it will still go into the atmosphere and cause climate change.\u201d Jacobs adds that, in the past quarter of a century, when countries could have been putting in place the infrastructure for a new green economy, they have been going in the opposite direction. They have invested in fossil fuel-burning power plants and built energy\u2011inefficient buildings in cities designed for cars. Carney believes climate change is the medium-term issue of our age, but talks about the \u201ctragedy of horizons\u201d. By this he means that central banks and finance ministers are set up to deal with short-term problems, such as whether inflation will hit its target in two or three years\u2019 time, or whether another housing bubble can be prevented before the end of the decade. Governments are thinking about climate change, but they have other more immediate priorities: reducing unemployment, increasing living standards and, in the case of politicians rather than the technocrats running central banks, getting re-elected.   Related: World cannot prosper without cutting carbon emissions, says Climate Group    To some in the environmental movement \u2013 the \u201cdeep greens\u201d \u2013 it seems pointless to expect politicians to do anything meaningful about climate change: they are obsessed with growth for its own sake, bend the knee to fossil fuel companies when they demand tax breaks and subsidies, and are reluctant to back the potential of renewables. In order to avoid ecological suicide, they argue, we must first recognise that capitalism is an insuperable obstacle to any reduction in our fossil fuel consumption. All of this may be true, but it leaves unanswered the question of how we get from where we are now to the kind of world the deep greens want to see. Let us begin with one basic idea: 250 years of growth based on the exploitation of fossil fuels has brought real benefits. There are those who might argue otherwise, but life in the world before the industrial revolution really was nasty, brutish and short. Life expectancy was 40 at best, the working week was long, disease was rife and diets were poor. Life for the vast bulk of the population was strictly no-frills, as it had been for more than a millennium. The current coalition government in the UK has come under attack for allowing the economy to flatline for a couple of years, but incomes per head barely rose in the 1,300 years between the sacking of Rome and the mid\u201118th century. The acceleration of growth and big increases in living standards only really began with the industrial revolution; they would not have happened without the exploitation of fossil fuels. Over the years, the idea that all growth is good became embedded. Parents expected their children to be better off than they were. Businesses that did not expand were viewed as failures. One four-letter word underpinned economics: more. And this, notwithstanding the corporate sustainability reports and the greenwashing, remains the case for even the most right-on companies. Unilever wants to sell more soap and deodorant. John Lewis commissions expensive ads to encourages us all to spend more at Christmas. Here at the Guardian, we want to sell more newspapers, and more ads to companies selling their own goods and services to readers. But the economics of more, together with a rapidly rising population, have created problems unforeseen at the time of James Watt\u2019s steam engine. At the end of the 18th century there were fewer than 1 billion people on the planet. Today there are more than 7 billion. The energy needs of a bigger and richer global population have risen sixfold in the past 50 years. Almost 90% of that energy is provided by fossil fuels \u2013 coal, gas and oil. Global temperatures have risen by almost 1C above pre-industrial levels, and the number of weather-related natural disasters has increased. Those who say manmade global warming isn\u2019t happening look more and more certain to end up on the wrong side of history \u2013 which will harshly judge our failure to act until the threat had become so obvious that we had no other options. * * * There are more climate change sceptics than we might like to think. But the problem goes much further than figures such as Tony Abbott, the prime minister of Australia, or Nigel Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, or about every Republican harbouring hopes of winning the nomination for the 2016 US presidential race. That problem is us. Dieter Helm, professor of energy studies at Oxford University, says: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear we\u2019re very serious about climate change. We want other people to do stuff, we want to divest from companies \u2013 but what about us? We are ultimately the consumers of those carbon-based products, and when we elect politicians, what\u2019s worrying is that we\u2019re not prepared to say: \u2018Make us pay for the damage and the pollution we cause.\u2019\u201d This is an uncomfortable thought. If climate change can simply be blamed on \u201cthe Man\u201d, on the evils of capitalism, or on a cabal of fossil fuel companies hell-bent on destroying the planet, then the solution is to take on the Man, replace capitalism with something kinder and gentler, and force the fossil fuel companies to shut down.    The average sub-Saharan African consumes the same amount of energy in a month as the average Briton does in a day    But if it can be blamed on \u201cus\u201d, the answer is not quite so simple. Fossil fuels are used to make and power mobile phones, tablets and laptops. There is no evidence that we want fewer of them. Nor would there be much support for a return to the days before fridges, gas cookers, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Smoking in a restaurant or bar is no longer socially acceptable; until the same applies to driving your son or daughter to school in a gas-guzzling 4x4, Helm is right: we are not very serious about climate change. This is one of the reasons why the deep-green approach to climate change is fraught with difficulty. The fossil fuel companies are in business because we want the products that fossil fuels make and power. It is not just a question of supply, but also a question of demand, which is why many people now have more than one smartphone and lust after the Apple watch. Does this make us any happier? Well, according to Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, economists at the University of Michigan in the US, the evidence is that wellbeing rises with income, and that the satiation point has yet to be reached, even in the richest countries. The experience of the past few years would appear to support the Stevenson-Wolfers argument: the idea that, above a certain level of prosperity, there is no link between happiness and income has yet to be tested in a period when living standards have been flatlining. But there is little evidence so far that the public is wildly keen on the idea that they are becoming worse off. The second problem with the deep-green approach is that even assuming rich people in the west could be persuaded to curb their consumption, it would not stop CO2 emissions from rising. That is because the real growth in energy demand from now on is going to come from the developing world.       Photograph: Murdo Macleod/Guardian    Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are home to around 630 million people with no electricity. Apart from the impact on households, power shortages are holding back growth and job creation. Firms have to depend on costly generators, which makes goods more expensive. Outside of South Africa, coal is a small part of the power story. Africa is far greener than the UK, the US or Germany, largely because of hydroelectric power in countries such as Ethiopia. Its carbon footprint is tiny. Again leaving South Africa to one side, the average person in sub-Saharan Africa consumes the same amount of energy in a month as the average Briton does in a day, according to Kevin Watkins, director of the UK\u2019s Overseas Development Institute. Without question, Africa\u2019s energy consumption is going to rise. It has abundant reserves of coal \u2013 the most damaging of the fossil fuels \u2013 and nations such as Angola and Nigeria are significant oil exporters. One option would be to skip fossil fuels entirely and move straight to renewables, especially solar energy, but Watkins says that this is too expensive for most countries to contemplate. \u201cAchieving universal access and a tenfold increase in power generation will take huge domestic investments and a big international financing effort.\u201d So, there is a choice. The rest of the world can help poor African countries with the cost of developing renewable energy; the rest of the world can provide Africa with expensive carbon capture and storage for coal-fired power stations; or the rest of the world can do nothing and watch Africa\u2019s carbon footprint rise rapidly as it burns dirty fossil fuels. There is no status quo option. India provides another example of the policy choices facing countries in the emerging world. Given the dreadful air quality in Delhi, the government led by Narendra Modi is well aware of the threat of climate change and has announced ambitious plans to increase solar power. But it also wants to ensure that every Indian citizen has access to electricity, and believes that can only be achieved by expanding coal power at the same time as it is expanding solar power. Watkins believes western governments and environmental NGOs would be better off mobilising finance for a programme of carbon capture and storage in India than offering Modi advice about the perils of climate change. The third difficulty with the anti-growth approach is that growth is part of the solution to climate change. Most growth is the result of innovation \u2013 the development of new products, new techniques and new ways of doing things that are an improvement on what went before. Since the middle of the 18th century, there have been successive waves of technical progress: coal and steam, railways and the internal combustion engine at the end of the 19th century; the mid-20th-century age of consumer durables and commercial air travel. The next wave looks like it will be dominated by digital technology, robotics, biotech, lighter materials and renewable energy. Nicholas Stern, who authored a 2006 report on the economics of climate change commissioned by then-chancellor Gordon Brown, says stopping growth misses the point. The possibilities opened up by this new wave of technology, he believes, provide hope that growth can be decarbonised over the decades to come. \u201cTo say that we have to stop growing \u2013 that we have to go backwards \u2013 I think is factually wrong, and also politically unlikely to be successful.\u201d       Photograph: David Levene/Guardian    Even if the world called a halt to economic expansion now, he adds, carbon emissions would continue rising and the world would be looking at an increase in global temperatures of 3-4C. \u201cWe absolutely can have growth and protection of the climate at the same time, and in doing so we will construct a much better form of economic activity and growth in terms of clean air, less-congested cities and so on,\u201d Stern says. \u201cIf we say the only way to handle this is to stop growing, we will be factually wrong, because if we stopped growing but didn\u2019t break the relationship between activity and emissions, we wouldn\u2019t be tackling climate change.\u201d In reality, only the deepest greens are opposed to all forms of growth. The Green party in the UK wants to grow the NHS and education; it wants a bigger budget for social care and a higher minimum wage. Tim Jackson of the University of Surrey, author of Prosperity Without Growth, says we need fewer resource-intensive activities that damage the climate, but more of the services that improve the quality of people\u2019s lives. Like Stern, he is not really talking about replacing the economics of \u201cmore\u201d with the economics of \u201cless\u201d; he is suggesting replacing it with the economics of \u201cbetter\u201d.   Related: Richard Branson leads call to free global economy from carbon emissions    There are only three ways of reducing our carbon footprint: reduce the amount each person consumes, reduce the number of people, or make each unit of growth less carbon-intensive. Those who want to cut consumption and restrict population growth have the same question to answer: unless you are prepared to use draconian methods, how do you do it? Historical evidence shows there is a link between income and population: as people become richer, they have fewer children. That is why Japan\u2019s population is ageing and shrinking. So if reducing living standards is a political non-starter and repression is spurned as a way of controlling population growth, that leaves reducing the carbon-intensity of growth. \u201cI think it\u2019s extremely simplistic to be pro-growth or anti-growth\u201d, says Helm. \u201cWhat matters is the sort of growth we choose. Now the underlying driver of economic growth is technical change, and technical change is accelerating. We want technical change, for example, to build new solar technologies. Do the deep greens say, \u2018Tell you what, we want to stop the boat now, we don\u2019t want to bother with any more technical change, let\u2019s go back to a more simple society, a more decentralised society, and one that has a smaller footprint on the planet\u2019? I think that\u2019s totally naive.\u201d * * * Even the light green approach is going to be tough, and might not work. The UN is hosting a conference in Paris in late 2015 that will seek commitments to reduce carbon emissions from all the countries attending. As things stand, the offers will fall a long way short of what the experts say is a level consistent with the 2C target \u2013 about 12bn tonnes a year, short according to Michael Jacobs. The fossil fuel company BP helpfully provided a ready reckoner in its latest Energy Outlook report for how 2bn tonnes of CO2 emissions could be saved by 2035. It would involve the share of gas used in power generation rising from just over 20% to more than 35%; coal with carbon capture and storage rising from almost zero to just under 10%; renewables increasing from around 5% to just over 20%; and finally, nuclear power almost doubling from just under 10%. The same 2bn tonnes of CO2 could be saved through substantial improvements in energy-efficiency over and above those already expected. Oil, coal and gas currently account for 86% of primary energy, and BP is forecasting only a small decrease, to 81%, by 2035. That is incompatible with the climate change projections made by the International Energy Agency, which thinks fossil fuels should make up no more than two-thirds of the energy mix. BP admits that, on its current projections, emissions will \u201cremain well above the path recommended by scientists\u201d.   Related: Why the Guardian Media Group is getting out of fossil fuels | Neil Berkett    The IEA also makes the point that it is time the world got its act together. \u201cDelaying action is a false economy: for every $1 of investment in cleaner technology that is avoided in the power sector before 2020, an additional $4.30 would need to be spent after 2020 to compensate for the increased emissions.\u201d Fossil fuels are not going to disappear overnight, but the phasing-out process needs to start immediately, and that process could be hastened if governments used the opportunity provided by the recent halving of global oil prices to remove the $1tn annual subsidies for fossil fuels. It is easy to see why governments, especially those in poorer parts of the world, want to help citizens with their energy bills. But the collapsing cost of crude oil is the equivalent of a tax cut for energy consumers; governments could remove subsidies painlessly in the current climate. The IEA is right: further delay will be costly. Obama could do his bit by making climate change a mission for the US \u2013 similar to the way that John F Kennedy vowed to put a man on the moon in the early 1960s. The mission could be to phase out domestic use and export of coal by a fixed date, or to set a deadline for shifting 50% of US energy consumption to renewable sources. Washington could then invite other nations to sign on to the same commitment. That message would be reinforced by putting a price on carbon. This could be achieved in one of two ways: through a carbon tax, or through a cap-and-trade scheme. Either way, it would suggest that governments had started to take seriously what Stern calls one of the greatest market failures in history: the failure to take account of the damage caused by burning fossil fuels.       Photograph: David Levene/Guardian    Once shareholders understand that governments are serious about climate change, they will start to look at their investment portfolios. New technologies, particularly those with first\u2011mover advantage, tend to be profitable, and there will be incentives for pension funds and insurance companies to get their money out of the fossil fuel sector and into a sector that has massive growth potential. On past form, governments will be slower to act than they should be. The lessons from the anti-apartheid and debt-relief campaigns is that divestment can be used to put pressure on governments to act. Politicians move when they know votes are at risk. There are not many votes to be won these days by promising to increase foreign aid, but taxpayers in the west have to realise that poor countries with copious reserves of fossil fuels are going to exploit them, and that one way of mitigating the impact is to transfer to them the latest technology. The exploitation of fossil fuels in the developing world is only going to be reduced if financial assistance is offered. The amount of money currently allocated by international bodies, such as the UN, for climate change adaptation and mitigation is less than $1bn a year: it needs to be at least 10 times bigger. Unless it is, there will be little point in saying that someone in sub-Saharan Africa can get all the power he or she needs via a solar panel costing as little as $200. After all, the average sub-Saharan African does not have $200 to spare. Success at the Paris conference would be easier if developing countries saw that the west was serious about providing help for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Jacobs says there is little prospect of countries hardening up their commitments between now and December, but it would be progress if there were agreements to tackle particularly damaging forms of climate change, such as deforestation, and to cut emissions to zero in the second half of the century. But that does not mean that we can afford to wait until the second half of the century to make the transition to non\u2011fossil-fuel energy. Building up the necessary infrastructure is going to be a long and expensive process, which should be encouraged through public procurement, tax incentives and a big increase in R&amp;D budgets. The stone age did not end because of a shortage of stone. The fossil fuel age will end either when there are newer, better and cleaner ways of providing energy, or when it is too late to prevent irreparable damage to the planet.           Why we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground \u2013 video    Renewable technology is moving on apace. Investment in clean energy is growing at a double-digit rate. That is the good news. The bad news is that renewables will still only meet around 20% of energy demand by 2035, even using optimistic assumptions about future growth rates. That is going to require some tough decisions and some compromises. Coal is by far the dirtiest of the fossil fuels; it needs to be phased out first, and rapidly. But there is going to be a lag, even on the most optimistic assumptions, before renewables can take the place of coal. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing very rapid change\u201d, says Stern, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to have to accelerate the arrival and installation and use of renewables, from hydroelectricity and wave power through to the various types of solar. We\u2019re going to have to look more closely at carbon capture and storage, because that\u2019s a way of using your fossil fuels without emitting. And we\u2019re going to have a period when gas is substituted for coal.\u201d Helm agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that we can\u2019t both burn fossil fuels and limit the damage from climate change. There are basically three steps toward getting out of fossil fuels. The first is to make people pay for the consequences of burning fossil fuels, and that\u2019s a carbon tax. The second is the transitionary bit: the only serious way in the next 15-20 years to bear down on coal is to switch from coal to gas. Gas is, of course, a fossil fuel, but it has half the emissions of coal, and we could make substantive cuts \u2013 as indeed the US has done \u2013 by making the switch. And then, further out, what we need are new technologies.\u201d So what will the world look like in 2043? The future sketched out in The Bone Clocks is only fiction. It does not have to be that way. We could be living through the green technological revolution, in which energy has been decarbonised. Atlanta and Barcelona have the same number of people and share the same per-capita incomes, but Atlanta\u2019s carbon emissions are 10 times those of Barcelona. We need more Barcelonas and fewer Atlantas, because that will encourage us to change the way we live: walking more, using public transport more, sharing cars, cycling. All of this is important, because ultimately Helm is right. This is not just about carbon taxes. It is not just about R&amp;D. It is not just about divestment. If we really want the fossil fuels to be left in the ground, it is about us. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread", "tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Climate change scepticism", "Fossil fuel divestment", "Fossil fuels", "Energy", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Business", "US economic growth and recession", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Energy industry", "Energy research", "Energy"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-08T05:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/09/abc-launches-web-portal-in-china-called-australia-plus", "sentences": ["While the portal \u2013 a partnership with Shanghai Media Group \u2013 will not replace the Australia Network, it does go some way to restoring the soft diplomacy referred to by Scott as a powerful reason to keep it going."], "title": "ABC launches web portal in China called Australia Plus", "article": "The ABC has partnered with a Chinese media company to open a web portal for Australian content in that country, becoming the first mainstream media organisation to launch a registered web portal in China.

In the short gap between Ferrari\u2019s sublime triumph in Malaysia and Sunday\u2019s race in Shanghai he has returned home, to the small hinterland where he can engage in his private passion, squeezed between his hectic working schedule in Italy as Ferrari\u2019s technical director and his severely abridged family life in England. In the monomaniacal world of Formula One even finding time for a hobby is extraordinary, particularly when tasked with a role that has involved him changing the culture at Maranello. But flying matters to Allison. Formula One may even be described as his second choice because first and foremost he wanted to be an RAF pilot, like his father. \u201cI\u2019m just about managing to cling on by my fingernails to the one enduring hobby I\u2019ve had from the whole of my childhood and adult life, and that is aeroplanes,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a private pilot\u2019s licence since I was 17. Before that I was a glider pilot and before that an aeroplane modeller. I like mucking around with planes, and mucking around with wood. I would like to make an airplane out of wood. That would be my Nirvana.\u201d Allison, 47, who returns from Italy to be with his wife and three children every second weekend, just manages to fly enough hours to keep his licence but he no longer takes part in the UK acrobatic events that so excited him. \u201cI was brought up on air bases and been surrounded by planes all my life. But when I was nine or 10 I learned I was colour-blind, and they don\u2019t let you become a pilot in the RAF if you\u2019re colour-blind. \u201cSo I had a focused ambition of cheating my way into the RAF by doing the Ishihara test, the one with coloured dots. They\u2019re designed in a specific way and if you understand how they\u2019re designed, even if you can\u2019t see them, you can figure out what they say. So I studied Ishihara books enough to understand how they were made and could see the pattern, even though I couldn\u2019t really see it. \u201cI went to Biggin Hill to do the test and was doing marvellously well but the doctor could see the half-second of pause that I took to work it out. So then he gave me another uncheatable test, and I was out.\u201d Allison flies an Auster Mark Five, which he describes as \u201ca particularly terrible 1930s high wing monoplane that is a ridiculous plane to own\u201d. It\u2019s the same plane his father used to fly him around in as a boy. \u201cWe had adventures and it was great fun. But then I went to boarding school and he had to sell it and he was heartbroken.\u201d Two years ago his father tracked down the plane and bought it back. \u201cHe said it was a brilliant bargain at \u00a34,000. And I told him it was only \u00a34,000 because it was a complete bag of bolts. \u201cI went to see him to pour scorn on the whole idea, to tell him he was a fool and that he should sell it. But instead of feeling the contempt for his purchase I got attacked by a fit of nostalgia as I remembered all the fun we\u2019d had in it. So we agreed to restore it together and we spent the next couple of years making it beautiful.\u201d During that period, in September 2013, Allison rejoined Ferrari from Lotus, having had a five\u2013year stint with the Italian team in their championship-hogging epoch at the start of the century. Yet Ferrari endured a difficult season last year in which they did not win a single race. A number of key personnel changed with the departure of the chairman Luca di Montezemolo and two\u00a0team principal changes in 12 months\u00a0culminated in the arrival of Maurizio Arrivabene. After five seasons Fernando Alonso left to rejoin McLaren, with Sebastian Vettel replacing him for\u00a02015. \u201cFerrari hold a special place in my heart because they picked me up at a low ebb in my career in 1999 [when he lost his job as head of aerodynamics at Benetton],\u201d says Allison.     Sebastian Vettel celebrates his Sepang triumph. \u2018Every now and then you get a race that is completely delicious,\u2019 says James Allison. Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Images    So his joy after Vettel\u2019s win at the Sepang Circuit last month was unconfined. \u201cIt\u2019s been lovely. All over. I\u2019ve been extremely lucky because I\u2019ve been in lots of teams that have won races and won championships by me being in the right place at the right time. Some people never get a race win in a whole career. \u201cBut every now and again you get a race that is completely delicious. It makes you feel like everything is worthwhile. Becca [his wife Rebecca] is the person who I pour out all my worries to. And her normal reaction is \u2018why don\u2019t you stop and do something less stressful?\u2019 \u201cI always feel the same thing when she says that, which is that she\u2019s never had the good fortune to feel what it feels like when things go right. It\u2019s tremendously affirming because there\u2019s no hiding when things are bad. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t done a good job it\u2019s paraded in front of the world every two weeks. Your worth is measured so precisely by the progress of your car. And that can be brutal. But when the car goes well it\u2019s a tremendous feeling and it makes all the bits that are tough dissolve away. And all the time that things are tough you think it doesn\u2019t matter, because you\u2019re going to get back to that feeling.\u201d The old Volkswagen camper van outside Allison\u2019s home is a clue to his modesty. When asked to explain his strengths he says: \u201cI don\u2019t lose my temper, ever, and I work quite hard, so people know I\u2019m putting the effort in.\u201d When pushed, he expands a little. \u201cI know enough, technically, across the car to know what is important and what\u2019s not as important and I try not to squander effort. And I hope I\u2019m a reasonable judge of character, and that the key appointments I\u2019ve made, previously at Lotus and subsequently at Ferrari, have been ones where my judgment has been rewarded and those people have paid me back a hundred fold.\u201d But Allison\u2019s most profound impact at Ferrari, he thinks, has been to pay more attention to the subsequent year\u2019s car. \u201cIf I had to be immodest, the main contribution I\u2019ve made has been to break out of the vicious circus Ferrari were in, which was to start the year with not the best car and then throw all efforts behind that car at the track, having a quixotic assault on a championship that was already lost. And pressure to keep pushing with that car, throwing good money after bad, was at the expense of the subsequent year\u2019s car, which meant that car would also come out of the blocks slower. \u201cIf I\u2019ve had any effect it has been to help the team break away from that pattern, to stop robbing the future Peter to pay the present Paul. You pay enormously if you ignore the future. We\u2019re not good enough yet but Ferrari were able to put more into the current car.\u201d There is a pellucid quality to the way he speaks and he says he learned much from his old Ferrari boss Ross Brawn. \u201cRoss\u2019s skill was in choosing good people and leading with a light touch, but with a strong sense of purpose. I\u2019ve tried to replicate what Ross did, in a very limited way.\u201d Allison admits Ferrari are still slower than Mercedes, who are strong favourites to win in Shanghai.

This is a former world champion who, at 35 and close to the end of his career, finds himself driving a car that he might have picked up in the pages of Auto Trader. But his enthusiasm will not be thwarted, and his smile is infectious, even though it may start to look a little cheesy by the time we get to Abu Dhabi at the end of November. The ending is likely to be happier for Button than it was for Loman, the protagonist in Miller\u2019s classic Death of a Salesman, who died when he crashed his car, apparently deliberately. McLaren will be competitive one day but it is likely to be a long haul after they failed, for the third time in three race weekends, to make it to Q2 on a Saturday afternoon, though for Sunday\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix they missed out by just two tenths of a second. Button, as always, embraces the positives. \u201cOf course I want to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve won a championship, 15 races, and it is tough right now. But Fernando Alonso and I have a team-mate that we can be competitive against, and have a bit of fun out there on the circuit, while we\u2019re trying to build this team into something special. \u201cTo challenge Mercedes, you\u2019ve got to be a manufacturer. That\u2019s exactly the reason for the McLaren-Honda partnership. It\u2019s going to take time, definitely, but at some point you have to make that decision to go in that direction. \u201cYou could say: \u2018What about next year or the year after?\u2019 \u2013 I do have a two-year contract, so there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll be here next year. I enjoy building a team up. And having a team-mate like Fernando \u2013 we have so much experience between us \u2013 we can really help this team progress throughout the season and next year. And we might win races next year.\u201d McLaren do not expect to get their act together until the circus comes to Europe next month but it could take a lot longer than that. They came here expecting more, only to find that the other teams had all taken a step forward. Button and Alonso were 17th and 18th respectively, beating only the two cars from the struggling Manor team. Button added: \u201cIt\u2019s always tricky when you start off in the winter with not doing much mileage. I think for everyone it was a big surprise to see us finish in Melbourne. I think for the outside world, they probably didn\u2019t think we made a big step from Melbourne to Malaysia but we did. It was very, very big. We weren\u2019t able to finish the race but we got a lot of useful information. I feel we still haven\u2019t got the best out of what we have right now. A lot of people have asked me how I\u2019m so positive and how the team are so positive and upbeat, and it is because we see a great future. It\u2019s just a lot of hard work now improving before we can get there.\u201d Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg has accused his Mercedes team of putting him under unnecessary pressure towards the end of Saturday afternoon\u2019s qualifying session. He missed out on pole to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton by just four-hundredths of a second in Shanghai and said he was unhappy with his team\u2019s instruction to speed up on his warm-up lap. He shouted \u201cCome on guys!\u201d to his team at the end of the session. He explained: \u201cWe need to look at that as it was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don\u2019t think it cost me anything, but even the mindset to know that I have to speed up a bit \u2026 so we need to look into that.\u201d Hamilton and Rosberg\u2019s presence on the front row reasserted Mercedes\u2019 dominance after Sebastian Vettel\u2019s triumph for Ferrari from second on the grid in the Malaysian Grand Prix two weeks ago.

The 37-year-old, who signed a 12-month contract back at Stamford Bridge last summer, has effectively been promised a job for life by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Yet the specifics of his future role at the club \u2013 whether on the playing staff, as a coach or with an ambassadorial brief \u2013 have yet to be formally discussed and there remains the possibility Drogba could explore alternative options in search of more regular first-team football given his desire to play on. Asked if he had made a decision on his future, the striker indicated he intended to continue a playing career that has taken in spells at Le Mans, Guingamp, Marseille, Shanghai Shenhua, Galatasary and two glittering periods with Chelsea. \u201cI have made a decision, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd no, this is not my last season.\u201d The forward, whose last goal came at Newcastle in December, would not elaborate, though talks are anticipated with his employers to determine whether he has a role on the playing staff at Chelsea next term. Mourinho had indicated last week that those discussions would take place. \u201cWe have to think, we have to speak, we have to know what he wants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of talks to do. But it\u2019s not a problem. I don\u2019t know if he wants to. There are people who, during their careers, earn the right and the power to make decisions and not wait for others to make decisions for them. What he did at this club for so many years puts him in a great position.\u201d The striker, who has won the Premier League three times and the European Cup once, started his first game since February in Sunday\u2019s 1-0 victory at Queens Park Rangers and is the only fit senior striker at the league leaders with Diego Costa and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my suffering from hamstring and calf injuries respectively. That is likely to see Drogba leading the line against Manchester United on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you don\u2019t play and then have to go into these kind of games, but I try to give my best,\u201d said the Ivorian. \u201cI tried to give the best of my physical capacity against QPR, so if the manager needs me I\u2019m always ready. \u201cThat was an important win [at Loftus Road]. We are only looking forward and we just wanted to win to get closer to the title. \u201cWe still have those two games against [the closest challengers] Arsenal and United still to play, but we try to only think about our game. We are top of the league. They are maybe thinking about us and hoping we make a bad result, but we are more positive that we want to win.\u201d Chelsea were far from at their best at Loftus Road but prevailed courtesy of Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s late goal and Thibaut Courtois\u2019s fine display in keeping QPR at bay. The Belgian goalkeeper had suffered in the recent victories over Hull and Stoke \u2013 he was beaten from 66 yards by the latter\u2019s Charlie Adam \u2013 but was back to his best, with one fine block to deny Matt Phillips granting the leaders the opportunity to pilfer the win with their only shot on target. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say the title is decided already, but if we had drawn the game at QPR it would have given Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City hope to be champions,\u201d said Courtois. \u201cBut by winning it, they can still see we are there on top, haven\u2019t dropped points and that\u2019s important. We know QPR is a very difficult game and we showed character. \u201cIt was not our best football but we got the three points. It was an important win.

Following Sunday\u2019s race, in which Rosberg finished second to Hamilton \u2013 the British driver\u2019s 35th victory and one that extended his lead in the Formula One world championship \u2013 the German accused Hamilton of driving too slowly at the front of the race. That leads to an obvious question: So why did he not attempt to pass him? Mercedes have always insisted their drivers are free to race and a few feisty duels, most memorably in Bahrain a year ago, have lent substance to their integrity. But have they changed their minds following an unexpected threat to their hegemony from Ferrari? It would be disappointing if this were the case because, as it stands, Mercedes still have the superior car, which has more downforce and horsepower than its Italian rival. There were clear signs before the race in China that Mercedes had been spooked by Ferrari\u2019s victory at the previous grand prix in Malaysia. There was even talk of them splitting their race strategies to ensure they beat a team who had displayed greater tyre preservation two weeks before. Hamilton said: \u201cI just said to the [Mercedes] guys, if I was in second and I had the pace that I had today, I would have been pushing to be as close as possible and passing. That\u2019s racing. They said maybe he [Rosberg] was just comfortable with second and I said well that\u2019s the difference between us. \u201cI want to win, always. And I would have done everything to get past. Or at least pushed for three laps. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. This is Formula One. I grew up watching the sport. You want to see overtaking. You want to see a battle. And now I\u2019m in the sport you don\u2019t want it to be too controlled. You don\u2019t want to back off to save the tyre. \u201cI want the guy to be up my arse if he\u2019s got the pace, up my arse and putting pressure on me. And if I can\u2019t defend it, you lose it. Like in Bahrain, I wasn\u2019t quick enough and I did everything I could to stay ahead. And that was the greatest race ever. Whether we could have had that today, I don\u2019t think so. I want to race.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s simplistic desire to race disguises the fact he has become a formidable all-round driver, one who can control a race from the front. \u201cI honestly felt great after the race because we went in the right direction the whole weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a one-two, which was the ultimate goal. I didn\u2019t make any mistakes and brought the team home. And it\u2019s the greatest feeling.\u201d Rosberg is arguably the most intelligent driver in the paddock, along with perhaps Sebastian Vettel, but for all that he knows deep down he cannot beat Hamilton and that his entire career as a driver has been defined by the Englishman\u2019s superiority, evident since their karting days of boyhood.

If you weren\u2019t looking for it, the chances are you\u2019d miss it. But this is where the Pret a Manger brand is taught and honed. Today, Pret is one of the capital\u2019s most visible businesses, almost as entrenched in the cityscape as a red letterbox or the lollipop tube sign. The firm, founded by the entrepreneurial friends Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham in 1986, rode out a harrowing first year \u2013 when it chalked up losses of \u00a380,000 \u2013 and recovered to establish itself as a suave new presence on the high street of Thatcher\u2019s London.  Steady growth continued in the 1990s, and in 2001 Metcalfe and Beecham sold a 33% share of the business to MacDonald\u2019s. However, this partnership ceased in 2008 when Bridgepoint Capital, a private equity firm, bought a controlling stake in Pret for \u00a3350m.  Ever since, despite the credit crunch and subsequent downturn, it has been fast uphill for Pret. Sales have continued to rise around 15% year on year, growth that has fuelled an ambitious expansion strategy. Pret now operates more than 360 outlets, in locations far beyond its London heartlands.  The company is exploring international markets too. Last year it opened outlets in Paris and Shanghai, adding to existing restaurants in Hong Kong, New York, Boston, Chicago and Washington DC. While Pret has expanded, the core characteristics of the brand have remained the same: the deep burgundy backdrop of the store signs, the five-pointed sheriff stars, the three omnipresent promises: \u201cFreshly Prepared\u201d, \u201cGood\u201d, \u201cNatural Foods\u201d. But it\u2019s inside the stores that Pret has cultivated its most distinctive identity. There\u2019s the quirky atmosphere \u2013 a mix of the upbeat and the helpful. There are the cheerful staff at the tills, baristas shouting out the orders for coffee, the drinks being relayed to the counter with all the theatre of a rugby ball emerging from a scrum. Pret\u2019s goal is to serve you within 60 seconds \u2013 with warm wishes in your ear \u2013 so with a tap of your card, you\u2019re on your way. The \u201cPret Buzz\u201d is one of things taught here at the Pret Academy. I have come here to find out more about how the company teaches its culture. I\u2019m let in and venture up a flight of stairs to a reception desk. It\u2019s a strange experience. The whole office space has been converted to resemble a Pret restaurant. Everything is instantly familiar: the beech wood floor and fittings, the exposed brickwork, the chrome coffee machines. At the end of the corridor is a presentation room, the walls bedaubed with exhortations to \u201cNever, Never, Never Give Up\u201d; up another staircase is a run of seminar rooms, in one of which a class of fledgling baristas are learning their trade.     Inside the Pret Academy.    In a neighbouring room I sit down with Andrea Wareham, Pret\u2019s director of people, to talk shop. Pret\u2019s an odd mix, we agree. There\u2019s the French name, the English food, American branding, and multicultural workforce \u2013 106 nationalities, Wareham says. But what I really want to talk about is this reputation for being cheerful.  Wareham, of course, maintains that Pret a Manger is a happy place to work. \u201cWe get lots of feedback from customers via social media, commenting on the positive experiences that people have when they go into a Pret. \u2018I went into Pret today and your team member did this for me or that for me\u2019, so there\u2019s this huge wealth of anecdotal feedback.\u201d The ethos, Wareham says, can be traced back to the opening of the first Pret store, just along the road in Victoria. \u201cBack then it was Julian [Metcalfe] with the tiny shop, and every Friday night they shut the shop, got the beers out and had a party. They had a few drinks and said thank you to each other. Julian has always said very simply, that happy teams equal happy customers equal a happy business.\u201d Yet how do you create genuine happiness? Some have found Pret\u2019s cheery exterior troubling. They ascribe it to a particularly twenty-first century form of emotional moulding \u2013 forcing staff members to act in a particular way.     All of our focus is on helping teams to feel good when they come to work  Andrea Wareham, Pret\u2019s director of people     Back in 2013, Pret\u2019s CEO, Clive Schlee, made headlines when he revealed that on store visits: \u201cThe first thing I look at is whether the staff are touching each other. Are they smiling, reacting to each other, happy, engaged? I can almost predict sales on body language alone.\u201d  Critics leapt on this as evidence that Pret was peddling an inauthentic \u201chave a nice day\u201d culture, the cheerfulness prised out of a workforce worried they were being spied upon. It\u2019s a charge that I put to Wareham. She denies this is the case at Pret. \u201cIf you tell people what to say it will come across as false. We don\u2019t do any of that. I think a lot of companies will talk about customer service. But we start before that. We create the happy team so that everything else flows.\u201d She points out that the staff retention rate is improving. In the last six years their annual employee turnover has dipped from 90% to 60%, which she claims is \u201cgood for this industry\u201d. So how does Pret attempt to create a happy workforce? It starts with its recruitment strategies. A staff member is not hired on the strength of a traditional CV but on whether they conform to the three core Pret behaviours: passion, clear talking and team working. \u201cIn the recruiting centres they are not asking about have you made sandwiches before, can you make coffee, they are asking questions to see if people have these qualities,\u201d Wareham says. If an applicant fits the bill they will soon find themselves at the academy learning the Pret culture. This means learning the art of interacting with customers and generating energy from behind the tills. \u201cThat\u2019s what the baristas are doing,\u201d Wareham says, \u201ccalling out the coffee, helping to create the buzz.\u201d   More experienced staff are brought back to the Academy too, to explore more cerebral ideas like psychometric testing. All senior staff members have insights profiles, a colour-coded variant of Myers-Briggs. There\u2019s a career path for those wanting to climb the ladder. You join as a team member, after three months you are promoted to become a team member staff, then you come to a fork where you can specialise, becoming a hot chef, a barista or a trainer in the shop.     Staff training at the Pret Academy.    After that you can rise to be a team leader and, after about three years of service, an assistant manager. \u201cEighty per cent of our managers start as team members,\u201d Wareham says. \u201cIf you invest in your people, if you put your absolute focus on that part of your business, then everything else flows. To any small business, I\u2019d say you have to put your money where your mouth is. Don\u2019t have a shiny office, don\u2019t have the lovely Apple Mac computers, don\u2019t do any of that. A traditional company will spend 7% of their turnover on marketing, but we spend 1% and we invest everything in our people.\u201d The company uses staff reward schemes. Every shop has a mystery shopper visit each week, who is looking for engagement with a team member.  If the mystery shopper has a good experience, team members get an extra \u00a31 an hour for the hours they have worked for the week. \u201cEighty per cent of our shops get the bonus every week,\u201d says Wareham.  There are other performance nudges too. For a particularly good example of customer service \u2013 helping a parent through the door with a pram for instance \u2013 team members are rewarded with Outstanding Cards, which translate into \u00a350 rewards. There are also perks for the customers. One such initiative is the Joy of Pret which allows staff to give away free drinks to returning or deserving customers. Ben Rogers, a 21-year-old trainee manager, says these perks make customers happy, which in turn makes the staff happy. Rogers, who has been working for Pret for two and a half years at a store in Vauxhall, London, applied to work for the company having seen an advert for Pret\u2019s school leavers\u2019 programme on a website. \u201cI was going to go to university and study business,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to become a manager but I looked at Pret and it looked like the same sort of thing. It seemed a good way to go.\u201d   Related: Kelly Hoppen: \u2018Take risks and trust your intuition\u2019    So what does Rogers say to those who believe the \u201cPret buzz\u201d is a facade. \u201cIf they are cynical\u201d, he replies, \u201cfeel free to give them my email. I genuinely really enjoy working here. If I have any bad feedback it gets sorted out. It\u2019s hard work, but every work is hard and it should be if you\u2019re going to get where you want to be.\u201d Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "tags": ["Supporting business growth", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Business", "Small business", "Food & drink", "Coffee", "Food & drink industry", "Life and style", "Work & careers", "Money"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-14T08:33:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/14/weekly-sport-diary-grand-national-many-clouds", "sentences": ["Hamilton wins in Shanghai  Formula One\u2019s jangling, billionaire-fuelled circus pitched up in Shanghai, where to no one\u2019s great surprise Lewis Hamilton claimed victory in the Chinese Grand Prix for the fourth time."], "title": "Many Clouds carries Leighton Aspell to historic double at Grand National", "article": "The Grand National, Britain\u2019s best-known and also most controversial horse race, was won by the 25-1 shot Many Clouds, as Leighton Aspell became the first jockey since Brian Fletcher, on Red Rum in 1973-74, to win the gruelling four-and-a-quarter-mile race for two years running.

Indeed, the main intrigue focused on some characteristic press conference chuntering about Hamilton\u2019s tyre management from his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who finished second, evoking memories of the two drivers\u2019 animosity last season. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to look after Nico\u2019s race,\u201d shrugged Hamilton. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to manage the car and bring it home as healthy and as fast as possible. That\u2019s what I did.\u201d After Malaysia and China, F1 continues its tour of international human rights blackspots by moving on to Bahrain this weekend. No fairytale end for Wiggins   There was to be no fairytale departure from road racing for Sir Bradley Wiggins in cycling\u2019s Paris-Roubaix classic, the Briton finishing 18th in his final outing for Team Sky. \u201cI\u2019ve just kissed [the Team Sky chief] Dave Brailsford on the forehead and told him we\u2019ve gone through a lot together. He\u2019s known me since I was an 18-year-old streak of piss and now I\u2019m a 35-year-old streak of piss,\u201d said Wiggins, perhaps unintentionally coining a career epitaph to end all career epitaphs. Germany\u2019s John Degenkolb took the honours for his second classic triumph in recent weeks, but the other main talking point centred on a near-disaster at a railway crossing \u2013 thankfully averted \u2013 when several riders were temporarily stranded in the path of an oncoming TGV train. Oxford thrash Cambridge   Oxford achieved the unique distinction of winning the university boat race twice, the 186th version of the race being the first to include the women\u2019s race on the same stretch of London\u2019s river Thames. Cheered on from the riverbanks and bridges by an estimated 250,000 well-refreshed spectators, Oxford thrashed their old rivals Cambridge by the distance of six-and-a-half lengths in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s races.", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2015-04-14T10:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/15/global-box-office-furious-7-lets-get-married-the-longest-ride", "sentences": ["Sleepless in Shanghai         Watch the trailer for Let\u2019s Get Married    We saw a few weeks ago how television has become a fertile picking ground for Chinese cinema, with reality-TV adaptations Running Man and Dad, Where Are We Going 2?"], "title": "Latin America-fuelled Furious 7 set to become 2015's first $1bn hit", "article": "The winner Far from assured when Furious 7 was on the starting grid two weekends ago, $1bn global box office for Universal\u2019s delayed tentpole now looks all sewn up \u2013 which will make it the first film through that gate in 2015. A $59.6m second frame for Vin Diesel and co in the US means a 59% drop \u2013 the outer edge of what\u2019s expected for big-opening blockbusters \u2013 but the studio barely will have blinked with China and Russia dropping into the race this week. The latter, historically F&amp;F-crazy, delivered a $15.9m opening that is a four-day record for the country; China, opening on Sunday, a $68.8m first day that is also unprecedented both financially and attendance-wise, beating Furious 6\u2019s entire 2013 run in one fell swoop.            The film team review Fast &amp; Furious 7    So director James Wan, new to the franchise, finds himself behind the wheel of the most successful instalment after just 10 days, topping number six\u2019s $788.7m. The Paul Walker factor has undoubtedly played a part in Furious 7\u2019s incredible surge, but there\u2019s a longer game here: the culmination of the expansive rebuild of the series since part four, taking it away from its genre-movie origins and bolting on the beefed-up action sequences, power-play casting and international locations befitting of the global-era blockbuster. There\u2019s a simplicity to old-fashioned automobile chaos understandable from London to Lombok, plus the series\u2019 growing reliance on CGI keeps younger audiences on-side. It\u2019s also tempting to pinpoint F&amp;F\u2019s endearingly hokey emphasis on family values for how strongly it continues to play in more traditionalist climes outside the west.   Related: Fast &amp; Furious 7 review \u2013 a satisfying global game of cat-and-mouse    Since Fast Five, the franchise has commanded 65+% overseas audiences (high for live-action), but it is Latin America that increasingly looks like at the heart of the F&amp;F family. Much has been made of the series\u2019 equal-opportunities policy on race and, with Michelle Rodriguez a fixture of the series, plus plenty of Spanish-speaking settings, this has played well with American Hispanics: they made up 37% of the opening-weekend audience in North American (and 75% overall were non-white). But Furious 7 makes clear the kind of traction the series has built up in central and South America, too. Mexico ($20.8m) opened higher than the UK ($19m), and is still \u2013 at $39.7m cumulative \u2013 edging it as the second biggest market behind China; of the 26 countries where Furious 7 was the highest opener of all time, 12 were Latin American. Never mind all the incoming petrolhead knockoffs (a sequel to 2014\u2019s Need for Speed has apparently now been greenlighted) \u2013 how about, post-F&amp;F, a greater acceptance of the serious financial benefits of a diverse casting policy?     Booming success ... Dwayne Johnson in Fast &amp; Furious 7. Photograph: PR    On $803.2m as the weekend wound up, Furious 7 should screech past $1bn very soon. That will be only Universal\u2019s second ten-digiter ever (Jurassic Park is the other), putting it in pole position among the studios for 2015 after Fifty Shades of Grey; a weird flip-flop after 2014 saw the studio manage its most profitable year ever with no traditional blockbuster in sight. The speculation now is how much more Furious 7 has left in the tank before Avengers: Age of Ultron clanks in on the penultimate April weekend; if the US holds well next time, and Japan kicks in strongly on 17 April, some people believe it could go as high as no 4 on the worldwide all-time chart, unseating the final Harry Potter. Who\u2019d have put money on that happening when the first film came out in 2001?  Sleepless in Shanghai         Watch the trailer for Let\u2019s Get Married    We saw a few weeks ago how television has become a fertile picking ground for Chinese cinema, with reality-TV adaptations Running Man and Dad, Where Are We Going 2? scoring strongly in February. New romcom Let\u2019s Get Married, focusing on the conjugal complications of four different couples, is the latest off the small-screen production line, placing ninth globally this week. But it\u2019s also part of a bigger trend, a local resurgence in romcoms over the last five years that stands in total contrast to how discredited and moribund the genre is in the States. Note the jobs of the four main protagonists: bridal boutique owner, violinist, airport security official, businesswomen. It\u2019s this affluent, middle-class constituency - and its anxieties about balancing a love life with professional aspirations - that seems to be driving the romcom boom in the fast-urbanising country. That was the milieu for the Tiny Times series that has taken $213.8m so far over there, 2013\u2019s Sleepless in Seattle homage Finding Mr Right (which took $84.4m), as well as a torrent of other gushy practitioners over the last half-decade. Let\u2019s Get Married, the trailer packed full of ravishing snapshots of foreign tourist spots, is very aware of the upwardly mobile set it needs to pull in \u2013 and the four-for-the-price-of-one structure seems to be another selling point. Up to $42.9m in its second week, it\u2019s climbing into the middle range that American romcoms used to comfortably nestle in on a regular basis; rarely blockbuster-big, but glossy repackagings of film-goers\u2019 lives that connect on a dependable basis. The Sparks finishing school     Dependable slush \u2026 Britt Robertson and Scott Eastwood in The Longest Ride. Photograph: Michael Tackett/AP    On the subject of dependable slush, master of the backlit romance Nicholas Sparks was back this weekend, with The Longest Ride cantering up as the 10th adaptation of his bestsellers since 1999\u2019s Message in a Bottle. Intertwining the story of a North Carolina rodeo bull-rider\u2019s new fling with a wartime courtship in flashback, it opened at $13m Stateside \u2013 just ahead of cult Ryan Gosling weepie The Notebook and squarely in the middle of the scale for a Sparks adaptation. Not bad considering the film\u2019s total lack of star involvement, and a certain kind of fingers-down-throat irony beginning to attach itself to the author\u2019s work after so much recent exposure. I say \u201clack of star involvement\u201d, but The Longest Ride does come with gilded lineage in the shape of 29-year-old lead Scott Eastwood, who will be hoping that the film starts to push his career Clint-wards.    Related: The Longest Ride review: stop the wooing, I want to get off    What is striking alongside the consistency of the Sparks brand (all but 2002\u2019s A Walk to Remember and last year\u2019s The Best of Me have taken $80m+ worldwide) is the procession of young male talent who\u2019ve used these adaptations to broaden their audience on their way up. All with budgets of the $20-30m order, these films have been cut-price alternatives on the old-school romantic epic allowing the likes of Gosling, Channing Tatum (2010, Dear John), Liam Hemsworth (2010, The Last Song), Zac Efron (2012, The Lucky One), James Marsden (2014, The Best of Me) and now Eastwood Jr to lodge themselves, via female audiences, deeper in the mainstream. The rest of the world         Watch the trailer for Asu Mare 2    Paddington gave Peru a rare nudge into the box-office spotlight at the end of last year. So it\u2019s good to see the country back in the world rankings again so soon, at No 13, with Asu Mare 2 \u2013 a sequel to the highest-grossing local film for 2013, a spin-off of comedian Carlos Alc\u00e1ntara\u2019s one-man autobiographical TV standup show. After lampooning his own childhood in the original, he gets on to his early love life and early artistic struggles in this one \u2013 a boost for a box-office market that is still small (worth $131.5m in 2013) but steadily growing in line with South America as a whole. In France, another local-boy comic favorite, Jamel Debbouze, fell just outside the global top 10 with a $3.5m take for an unusual choice of directorial debut: Pourquoi J\u2019ai Pas Mang\u00e9 Mon P\u00e8re?, an animated romp about the exiled son of a monkey king that looks somewhere between Ice Age and Year One. Finally, Wolf Warriors, Wu Jing\u2019s action thriller about a special-forces soldier forced to go rogue \u2013 that old chestnut \u2013 held fairly solidly in its second week for the runner\u2019s-up spot in China and fourth place globally.  The future         Watch the trailer for Mr X    One more weekend before The Avengers sequel stomps into town and rearranges the all-time box-office chart \u2013 just enough time for Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Paddy Considine to put on their best slav-face (or Russian accents, at least) as Soviet-era child-murder thriller Child 44 opens in 20, predominantly European markets. Meanwhile, Liam Neeson\u2019s latest geri-action nugget, Run All Night, with Russia, Australia and Mexico among its 20-or-so openings, is looking for a quick international top-up to a wan-looking $47.1m haul. Chinese\u2019s biggest female box-office draw Fan Bingbing, who you might have seen in the local cut of Iron Man 3 and X-Men: Days of Future Past, adds to the native romcom boom with Ever Since We Love. And fellow filmic traveller Emraan Hashmi \u2013 who recently starred for Oscar-winner Danis Tanovi\u0107 in the interestingly-looking pharmaceutical expose Tigers \u2013 goes for the mainstream jugular in India with Mr X. He follows in the disembodied footsteps of Claude Rains, Chevy Chase and Kevin Bacon, by playing a man with the power of invisibility, and the temptations whereof. Developed by Fox Star India, this \u2013 with oddly familiar steel-blue \u201dX\u201d livery stamped all over the trailer \u2013 feels like a sly attempt to seed the western-superhero bug in Bollywood audiences.

Before it, England had no\u00a0such thing as a secondary-education system. If you were rich you might go\u00a0to Eton or Rugby or Winchester or Harrow; if you were lucky you might live near a city merchant\u2019s charitable foundation. But for most people there was nothing much at all. The 1869 act changed that by seizing the endowments that had been left, over the centuries, to the ancient grammar schools and distributing the money in what was, in some ways, a more sensible fashion: for example, by funding schools for girls. But the act also abolished provisions made for educating poor scholars completely free \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the something-for-nothing society, this was Victorian England. And it helped split schools into three basic types, for working-class, middle-class and upper-class children \u2013 a divide, buried though governments have tried to make it, that continues to distort and disfigure the education system today. There\u2019s something else people need to know about the 1869 act. The heads of the endowed schools hated it, and set up a club, the Headmasters\u2019 Conference, to defend themselves against it. It is now called the Headmasters\u2019 and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference, but it\u2019s still the main body representing the elite education providers in Britain, the\u00a0schools that, even now, can promise pupils a much better chance than average of gaining wealth, power, Ucas points, and membership of the mysterious old boys\u2019 networks that continue to gird the globe. \u201cMore than half of the top medics, civil servants, lawyers, media figures and Conservative MPs\u201d in Britain attended an HMC school, says David Turner, not to\u00a0mention \u201cpop stars \u2013 22% of them, according to the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission\u201d. Worse, the very fact such privilege exists causes many people to feel that state schools, no\u00a0matter how good they are, are never good enough. Academies, free schools and grammar schools, and church places, music places and places for whatever else: all spring from a sense of inadequacy that goes back decades. Neither the Endowed Schools Act nor the Taunton Commission on grammar schools that preceded it feature much in Turner\u2019s history of the British public school. As his title implies, he\u2019s an old boy himself, and comes not to bury but to prod gently at the institutions that made him (the book is coy about which school he went to, so I\u00a0asked his publisher: King\u2019s College, Wimbledon; followed by St John\u2019s College, Cambridge.) Much of the book is anecdotal and affectionate: \u201cI have suffered indigestion from trying to understand Notions, the Winchester College argot, while lunching with the scholars\u201d, and so on. But even when it\u00a0is making more substantial arguments, the book\u2019s basic sympathy for the public-school system \u2013 poor plucky little mites, forced on the defensive by\u00a0all those brawny state schools with their vulgar A-levels \u2013 makes it quite an\u00a0odd and frustrating read. \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d Turner states, \u201cI need to establish my definition of a\u00a0public school.\u201d But the definition he\u00a0plumps for \u2013 \u201ca school independent of\u00a0state control which has primarily educated members of the elite\u201d \u2013 surely isn\u2019t right. The reason public schools were called public in the first place was precisely because they weren\u2019t entirely independent, but regulated by the statutes of their founders: there it is on\u00a0the Charity Commission website, the Kynge\u2019s College of Our Ladye of Eton Besyde Windesore, alongside Oxfam and Save the Children, and subject to the same tax breaks, even now. Pauperes et indigentes scholares: that is what it says on the founding documents of Winchester College. These schools have charitable status because they were set up to educate poor and indigent scholars for the public good. The earliest public schools, though, had education of the poor as only their secondary purpose. The bigger aim was to make sure there were enough priests to run the church. William of Wykeham, according to Turner, had observed how church government was broken after the 1348 Black Death: in\u00a01379 he established New College, Oxford, to repopulate the priesthood, then added Winchester as a feeder for it in the early 1380s. The founding statute famously allowed for 70 of the \u201cpoor and needy\u201d, but also up to 10 fee-paying \u201csons of noble and influential persons, special friends of the said College\u201d. Thus the distinction between the poor-but-brainy scholars subsidised by the rich-but-dim commoners was built into the system right at the beginning. Cruelty, corruption and cheese-paring infested these places from the very start. In 1373, Turner reports, the bishop of Norwich forbade teaching in the churches of King\u2019s Lynn, \u201con the grounds that the cries of beaten pupils distracted worshippers\u201d. Scholars at Westminster three centuries later enjoyed thrashing the commoners, \u201cnot only to bruises and bloodshed, but often even to wounds, and Scarrs, that remain al the daies of their life\u201d. And so, across the centuries, the violence and damage went on: master-on-boy, boy-on-boy and sometimes boy-on-master. Eton experienced six \u201cfull-scale revolts\u201d between the 1770s and 1830s and Rugby five, including one in 1797 in which boys took prisoners at swordpoint. It was after a rebellion at Marlborough in 1851, Turner says, that the headmaster hit on the idea of team sports as offering \u201ca sublimated violence which made it an especially powerful substitute for the knightly training of earlier centuries\u201d, not to mention as a\u00a0\u201cprophylactic against certain unclean microbes\u201d \u2013 in other words, sex. Then, when the schools belatedly started teaching maths and science, the violence became technological. \u201cIn the 20th century, public-school boffins and leaders of men invented the tank and worked out how to use it strategically \u2026 The improvements in the curriculum made the upper class a much more effective warrior class than before.\u201d    Cruelty, corruption and cheese-paring infested these places from the very start    Turner used to work as the FT\u2019s education correspondent, and his book gets more searching the closer it gets to the present day. A \u201cgolden age\u201d came in with the 1980s as successive Thatcher governments starved the state schools while subsidising private ones with the assisted places scheme. The schools used the extra money to begin \u201cthe facilities arms race\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou should always have a building on the go, like your knitting,\u201d as Heather Brigstocke, the former high mistress of\u00a0St Paul\u2019s girls\u2019 school, advised. By the time New Labour abolished assisted places in 1997, a new global elite was emerging, prepared to pay almost limitlessly for a\u00a0prestigious anglophone education. International pupils made up 36% of boarders by 2014, Turner points out, with close on half of that from China and Hong Kong. Average fees are now in real terms the highest ever: \u00a328,788 a year for boarders, \u00a312,723 for day pupils. As Turner says, attempts the state has made to curb the power of these schools \u201chave generally oscillated between mild and total incompetence\u201d. Rab Butler had the best chance ever in his great Education Act 1944, but for all sorts of\u00a0disappointing reasons, he blew it: \u201cThe\u00a0first-class carriage has been shunted into an immense siding,\u201d as he\u00a0later wrote. A future government, Turner suggests, might try forcing top universities to take more state-school children, thus removing the public schools\u2019 biggest competitive advantage. But instead of that, both Labour and the Tories are currently focused on the public-benefit requirement placed on the schools by charities law. Labour proposes what Tristram Hunt has called \u201ca\u00a0School Partnership Standard \u2026 if they want to keep their business-rates relief\u201d; the Tories have funded the Independent-State School Partnerships forum, whose website is due to go\u00a0live in May. Both parties have also encouraged public schools to sponsor academies, though so far the results are not auspicious. Wellington College\u2019s Wellington Academy was given a \u201cRequires improvement\u201d rating at its Ofsted inspection last year, and in 2013, Dulwich College pulled out of sponsoring the Isle of Sheppey Academy in Kent. Strangely, neither school seems to have experienced such problems when expanding overseas: Wellington International Tianjin opened in 2011 and the Shanghai branch last year; Dulwich has franchises in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Zhuhai, Seoul and Singapore. Strangely, too, Turner has little to say about either\u00a0academies or overseas franchises, though, love them or hate them, such developments are surely what the future is all about. Instead of that, he concludes by noting that today\u2019s public schoolboys \u201care cognisant of the fact that roasting boys [is] not morally acceptable\u201d, which I suppose is always something, and that \u201cthe public schools deserve much of the credit\u201d for teaching them \u201cto embrace and master the modern world\u201d. \u2022 To order The Old Boys for \u00a320 (RRP \u00a325) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

It\u2019s not a well-known building but it survives to tell an important part of Beijing\u2019s development over the past century. Tucked away among courtyard homes, the old exchange is located to the west of Qianmen, the gate that used to guard access to the inner city. The Qianmen neighbourhood has historically been Beijing\u2019s centre of commerce. Geographically isolated and ruled by an increasingly conservative Qing dynasty, change had come slowly to Beijing. While skyscrapers were going up in New York and Chicago, goods still arrived in Beijing on camel-back.     The rundown old exchange has been split into several separate living areas. Photograph: Jens Schott Knudsen    At the beginning of the last century this changed. In 1906, a hole was torn through the ancient city wall and a railway station opened next to the Qianmen gate. This was the beginning of the end of the city wall and the start of a century of rapid changes. The 1911 revolution ushered in the China\u2019s warlord period with different factions fighting for control of the country. In Beijing, the city began its transformation from an imperial city that had seen few changes over several centuries to a modern metropolis. On West Riverbank Street by the city\u2019s moat, a growing number of banks and hotels began to appear to serve the influx of merchants. Roads were paved, and western engineering and architecture began to leave their traces on the city\u2019s streets and buildings.    While skyscrapers were going up in New York and Chicago, goods still arrived in Beijing on camel-back    It was in this turbulent environment that the Beijing stock exchange was established in 1918. It was the first stock exchange owned and operated by Chinese people. Foreigners had brought public trading to Shanghai decades earlier but a domestic securities market had never fully developed. Indicative of the growing foreign influence and capitalism, the building was a break from traditional Chinese architecture with a facade and an interior marked by both Chinese and western styles. Inside, a light-filled, two-storey gallery is surrounded by wooden pilasters, and on the second floor, an intricately designed iron fence lines the balcony. The exchange operated for several decades before trading stopped in the 1940s. It reopened briefly after the Communist party took over in 1949, and then closed for good soon after. Like elsewhere in the city, the communist government took a practical approach to the use of the building. After housing navy cadets for a few years, the building was taken over by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and used as housing for its researchers and students. Today, western-style capitalism and freewheeling development are back. In 1990, China got its own stock exchange again \u2013 this time in Shanghai. Meanwhile in Beijing, the first foreign fast-food chain opened in the late 1980s around the corner from the old exchange. And down the street, by the Qianmen gate, developers have now transformed the old commercial neighbourhood into a pedestrian mall, complete with faux 1930s-era shops and restaurants. In other parts of Beijing, space-age architecture dots the skyline and the city\u2019s expansion continues at a steady pace \u2013 one mega-block and high-rise compound at a time.     The facade of the old exchange on Qianmen West Riverbank Street. Photograph: Jens Schott Knudsen    Qianmen West Riverbank Street has not received much attention from developers and the government. A city agency has recently renovated some of the building facades on the street \u2013 including the old exchange. The agency also put up a sign explaining the significance of the exchange in Chinese and English. The new sign stands in sharp contrast to the inside of the building. While a sense of its grandeur remains, the interior is rundown and makeshift housing structures fill the floor of the gallery. The Chinese Academy of Sciences nominally still owns the building. The tenants are no longer scholars but the two walls of active electric meters suggest that they reside there legally. The fate of the old stock exchange lies in the hands of several layers of stakeholders, from the Chinese Academy of Science and the current tenants to the city agency and other parts of the government. So far, this relationship has mostly preserved the status quo. In this way, the ghost of the exchange provides a telling illustration of how Beijing struggles with its past with no single entity taking charge of the preservation efforts. This impasse does, however, mark a change from the time the city dealt with its old neighbourhoods by tearing them down \u2013 something the disappearance of the city wall and more than two-thirds of the city\u2019s hutongs can attest to. Today, redevelopments like the Qianmen neighbourhood, even if heavy-handed, suggest an eagerness to preserve some version of the past. The river moat and the bankers may be long gone, but the exchange remains to tell a story of Beijing and China\u2019s transformation and future challenges. Given the building\u2019s central location and the city\u2019s relentless growth, it\u2019s a story that is still being written.  \u2022 Which other buildings in the world tell stories about urban history?

The Briton comfortably beat Rosberg in Shanghai, managing his tyres and the gap with aplomb, after which the German accused him of selfishness, arguing that Hamilton had deliberately backed off the pace to compromise his Mercedes team-mate\u2019s strategy. Rosberg said in China that Hamilton was \u201cjust thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race\u201d. Asked in Bahrain whether his comments will have actually given Hamilton an edge, he said: \u201cMaybe, because I am standing here and answering all these questions.\u201d He then admitted that the conversation would have better been confined to the team\u2019s motorhome. \u201cI would do it again because I felt the need to discuss things after that race,\u201d he added. \u201cI would not do anything different, apart from discussing it with you.\u201d Rosberg has done his best here to play it down while Hamilton was also eager to move on from the incident. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue between me and Nico,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw each other this morning and everything is good. There are going to be times when people are unhappy about some things but we\u2019re grown-ups and we move past it.\u201d Yet this is a stance far easier for the British driver to hold as the pair prepare to go wheel to wheel at a track where last year they duelled in thrilling proximity over the closing laps, from which a bullish Hamilton emerged victorious. Rosberg led the championship at that stage but it is his team-mate who now has the whip-hand. Hamilton has finished ahead of Rosberg in nine of the last 10 races, winning eight of them, and this season has out-qualified him in all three rounds. Where Rosberg appears to some extent to have hit a wall, unable to match Hamilton on a single lap or in race pace, the Briton appears serene and untroubled in a car performing exactly to his requirements. For a driver this is already a psychological advantage and the key issue in China, that Hamilton was backing Rosberg up in to the clutches of Sebastian Vettel in third, is likely to play more on the German\u2019s mind in Bahrain, on a track that will favour Ferrari, as it did in Malaysia, where Vettel won. The threat from Ferrari was acknowledged this week by Toto Wolff when the Mercedes principal admitted some form of team orders may be adopted. \u201cIt may be if we are risking a win against Ferrari we would make an unpopular call, not to freeze everything, but manage them more,\u201d he said. This was a view echoed by Rosberg here. \u201cThe situation is the same as it always has been. We have agreed it and whenever the team\u2019s one-two is at risk, there are measures that will be used to ensure that,\u201d he said. But for those measures to benefit Rosberg truly, he really needs to be ahead of Hamilton, who was clearly happy not to enter the debate. \u201cI just do my talking on the track, that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been since I was eight years old,\u201d he said. Hamilton also defused the minor furore that had arisen after pictures on the podium at China showed him spraying Liu Siying, a 22-year-old graduate of the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, with champagne. Liu had already largely dismissed the condemnation and told the Shanghai Daily: \u201cIt lasted for only one or two seconds, and I didn\u2019t think too much about it. I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic than local media. I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201d Hamilton said he was relieved to hear Liu\u2019s comments, and that it was a \u201cfun thing\u201d in celebrating a win. \u201cI would never intend to disrespect someone or try to embarrass someone like that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that the lady wrote in \u2013 if it had been the other way and she\u2019d wrote in and she was really unhappy, then perhaps there would be more concern.\u201d", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Nico Rosberg", "Mercedes GP", "Ferrari", "Formula One 2015", "Formula One", "Sport", "Motor sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-04-16T17:24:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/17/melbourne-international-comedy-festival-where-to-eat-and-drink", "sentences": ["Having devoured a box of moreish prawn dumplings from the Shanghai Dumpling House two nights earlier, while jogging along Flinders Street to a standup show, I was already on board with the city\u2019s dumpling joints.", "Supernormal, however, left me longing for Shanghai\u2019s grubby floor, strip lights and mismatched morsels in a plastic box.", "Along with Shanghai Dumpling on Tattersalls Lane, my best meal was at another cheap and cheerful place that I believe is a favourite with ravenous comedians."], "title": "Melbourne international comedy festival: where to eat and drink after a show", "article": "Let\u2019s be clear: arts festivals are great. Getting to cover a festival in front and behind the scenes is, in my books, even better. However, whether you are a punter or a journalist, a full day of festivalling can be exhausting.  There is infinitely more to see than there are hours in the day, yet the buzz and quality of entertainment on offer seems to induce a kind of temporary festive insanity. The more drained you become, the more determined you are to plough on, which is why sustenance is key. During my six days spent at this year\u2019s Melbourne International Comedy festival, I kept track of the cafes, restaurants and bars that fuelled my venue-hopping from morning until, well, morning.  Bearing in mind that hefty ticket prices mean food budgets usually suffer, I did not indulge but kept things modest. I was simply keen to sample an eclectic range of Melbourne\u2019s legendary food and drink scene.  Here\u2019s my pick of the pitstops I made, along with a couple of duds.  Coffee My usual of habit of one strong coffee per day went out the window almost immediately, which is good because Melbourne clearly isn\u2019t lacking in cafes. And given the quality of roasts and baristas, my increased need for caffeine didn\u2019t actually result in being over-caffeinated.  I\u2019ve only been in Australia since December, so I\u2019m still learning to trust that a good single-shot long black delivers a kind of mellow buzz that\u2019s hard to find in London. But Melbourne coffee quickly fired me into an enjoyable, non-jittery state and kept me there. My go-to place was the newer branch of Bowery to Williamsburg on Hardware Street. I could have sipped their coffee all day, though eyeing up the cramped, communal table area, I was always glad to be getting takeaway.  Had I been staying nearby, Dukes on Flinders Lane would have been top pick. I\u2019ve found some coffee too perfumed over here (sorry, Single Origin) but Dukes seemed to nail that sweet spot between aromatic and full-bodied. Definitely worth the occasional queue.      A latte will keep you going until the next show. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters    Food When I say I wasn\u2019t indulgent, I was mostly referring to solids. Staying at the Melbourne University end of Elizabeth Street meant I fell into a habit of grabbing a piping hot beef or chicken g\u00f6zleme from the Borek Bakehouse around mid-afternoon, having forgotten to eat breakfast or lunch. They were so hot because I always arrived just as the bakery was closing, so the staff would roll their eyes and make me a fresh one. I would not recommend this method of eating a g\u00f6zleme, but cooled down a bit, they were totally delicious, not too greasy and endlessly affordable. The fact you can watch them being made through the window was definitely part of the attraction. On my final day in Melbourne I finally had time to try one of the city\u2019s cooler eating \u201cdestinations\u201d. Having devoured a box of moreish prawn dumplings from the Shanghai Dumpling House two nights earlier, while jogging along Flinders Street to a standup show, I was already on board with the city\u2019s dumpling joints.  Supernormal, however, left me longing for Shanghai\u2019s grubby floor, strip lights and mismatched morsels in a plastic box. My more expensive pork dumplings were knitted together with a greasy egg glaze that was hard to make sense of let alone manhandle with chopsticks. I also ordered a side of brown rice and I\u2019m not sure I can honestly claim to have found flavour in it. The free roasted pumpkin seeds were ace, as was the service and atmosphere, so maybe I just made an unlucky order. Along with Shanghai Dumpling on Tattersalls Lane, my best meal was at another cheap and cheerful place that I believe is a favourite with ravenous comedians.  Flora Indian restaurant, opposite Flinders Station, has a somewhat baffling ordering system but I didn\u2019t mind not getting what I thought I\u2019d ordered because it was still a mountain of authentic, rich marsala goodness.      Flora Indian restaurant is the real deal. Photograph: Fred McConnell/The Guardian.    I say authentic because the flavours, segmented metal dish and enough roti to use as cutlery reminded me of being in India, not because I\u2019m actually knowledgable.  I think the key here is to order large. I was even able to swing some free chutney because a) I was so tired I genuinely messed up my order and b) the server could tell it was my \u201cfirst time\u201d.  Alcohol I was surprised to feel a little underwhelmed by the bars in Melbourne, at least in the CBD. Perhaps a comedy festival isn\u2019t the best time to bar-hop, as evenings are generally when punters are seeing shows. Also it was quiet because of Easter weekend, which people kept reminding me as though someone had just died. Campari House was as fine a place as any to start an evening, especially to someone still finding rooftop bars an incredible novelty. However I was a bit disappointed at the lack of overt Campari celebration/peddling. Maybe I missed the point, but it is called Campari House and that is why I was excited to be there. Section 8 made me feel like an old man, frustrated at being unable to continue the conversations we\u2019d started at the previous bar because the mediocre DJ was too loud. I tried to order a local craft beer that wasn\u2019t too hoppy and was offered Brooklyn Brewery lager, which I think made both the bar person and I feel awkward.  I\u2019m reluctant to admit quite how often I found myself settling for the festival club at Hi-Fi, where there was always a good late-night show but also a baffling preponderance of canned Victoria Bitter (VB) drinking. Yuck.  So instead, I\u2019ll finish in Fitzroy where Bar Open and G&amp;Tea helped me realise the downside of the festival is that I was mainly confined to the CBD. G&amp;Tea especially was a wonderful find, with $7 happy-hour drinks and informed yet not-too-attentive service.

By 1965 numerous US cities already had skateboarding bans, while 50 years later \u201cskate stopper\u201d devices (ranging from metal prongs on ledges to roughened pavement surfaces) have mushroomed across city squares worldwide, spoiling skateboard fun with universal determination.  Typical is the \u201cScoop\u201d amphitheatre beside London\u2019s City Hall, a pseudo-public space managed by the More London office development and which deploys a metallic army of joy-killing knobs. In this version of the skate city, skateboarding is expelled from urban centres and confined to the invisible hinterlands of suburbia and industrial estates. Except this is not the whole story. Skateboarders are fighting back. What\u2019s more, many of the general public, charities and councils, along with a few enlightened developers, architects and companies, are starting to agree. One healthy sign of this emerging shift came in 2014, when an immense public campaign saved the historic undercroft skateboarding spot at London\u2019s Southbank Centre from being turned into retail units. Today, as well as its section 106 agreement guaranteeing the continuance of skateboarding in the undercroft, the Southbank Centre is keen to pursue further skateboarding and other urban arts activities under its Hungerford Bridge site. Skateboarding is now an established part of this major international arts venue.     The undercroft skating area at London\u2019s Southbank Centre, saved from redevelopment. Photograph: Alamy    Buoyed by this success, other skaters have been fighting off ill-conceived plans for skateboarding bans everywhere from Norwich to Columbia City, Indiana. They are also more aware of the legal opportunities available. Brixton-based Friends of Stockwell Skatepark have followed the Southbank Centre undercroft in gaining \u201casset of community value\u201d status for their 27-year-old facility, and are looking to expand the skatepark still further. Rom skatepark in Essex acquired Grade II listing from English Heritage last year, while the Bro Bowl in Tampa Bay, Florida, has gained similar historic preservation status \u2013 and is heading for laser-scanning and reconstruction under a park redevelopment programme.  Skateboarding\u2019s burgeoning \u201cDIY\u201d movement is also playing a part, where skaters add home-made ledges, bowls and transitions to existing urban spaces and so fabricate new skate opportunities. Often these are transgressive acts, but many others \u2013 like the famous Burnside project in Portland, Oregon and Levi jeans-funded Holy Stoked skatepark in Bangalore \u2013 involve the active collaboration and approval of local authorities. The Burnside project began in 1990 when local skaters like Mark Hubbard, Mark \u2018Red\u2019 Scott and Bret Taylor first added a few ad hoc concrete transitions to a piece of wasteland beneath a road bridge. Through a combination of skater manpower, free concrete from a friendly contractor and lots of local politicking, Burnside quickly mushroomed into a full-blown skatepark with full city approval, and has become internationally renowned as one of the most challenging skateparks in the world. \u201cEvery skater knows what Burnside is,\u201d says Hubbard. \u201cEvery skater would like to visit it at least once. That\u2019s what makes it legendary.\u201d Burnside has even been credited with regeneration powers, replacing the site\u2019s former drug-addicts and prostitutes with a much more amenable bunch of regulars.     Burnside Skate Park in Portland. Photograph: Steve Dipaola/Invision/AP    It\u2019s not just skaters, then, who are cultivating a new kind of skate city. A skate infrastructure building boom is under way, with just about every UK council \u2013 having realised that skateboarding is healthy and accessible \u2013 now boasting at least one new skatepark in the heart of the local community.  Public spaces can also integrate skateboarding alongside other pursuits, from cycling and parkour to walking and running. The $4.5m Paine\u2019s Park in Philadelphia offers 2.5 acres of landscaping and walkways, plus skater-friendly banks, ledges and blocks. Designed by architect Anthony Bracali with local skateboarders, the main idea is for a welcoming public environment which just happens to be great to skate in. At Rabalder Park in Roskilde, Denmark, a rainwater drainage system has been inventively re-purposed by architect S\u00f8ren Nordal Enevoldsen for skateboarding and other activities. Other stealth-skateboarding venues are also popping up, with renegade skater-architects apparently smuggling skateboard-friendly features into their designs. For Sn\u00f8hetta\u2019s Opera House in Oslo, architects consulted skateboarders regarding surface textures and materials, leading to parts of the building and its immediate surroundings being kitted out with skateable marble ledges, kerbs, bench-like blocks and railings. At Foreign Office Architects\u2019 Auditoria Park in Barcelona, innumerable walls, banks and ramps tempt skaters with curving transitions and long runs.     An architects\u2019 vision of Rabalderparken, Denmark. Composite: SNE architects      Of course, skateboarding is big business too. London\u2019s new House of Vans skatepark is both a rolling advertisement for the $2bn shoe company and a free-to-enter skatepark and cultural venue in a prominent central location. City authorities are also realising skateboarding\u2019s financial potential, with Louisville, Ohio, Shanghai and George Town, Cayman Islands establishing multimillion pound skateparks to promote tourism. Haderslev in Denmark, for example, has just opened its elaborate \u00a33.6m StreetDome skatepark. Replete with grass-domed arena and provision for skateboarding, kayaking, music, parkour and climbing, here \u201curban sport, street culture and youthful souls all meet together\u201d. As this all suggests, skateboarding is now reaching deep into mainstream culture and education. The US Skate Pass system provides equipment and training to school teachers, adding skateboarding to the sports children can pursue now and into later life. Likewise, the \u201cCreate a Skate\u201d initiative \u2013 founded by skateboard manufacturer Paul Schmitt \u2013 lets kids fabricate and decorate skateboard decks, and so acquire design and technology skills. Still other ventures have even more ambitious social agendas. Community-oriented projects like EthiopiaSkate and Megabiskate in Addis Ababa, Ride It in Detroit, Skateistan in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa, SkatePAL in Palestine, 7Hills in Jordan, Bedouins in Tunisia and the All Nations Skate Project in America all deploy skateboarding to build social capital and counter deep-rooted issues with alcohol, drug abuse, unemployment, violence, gender prejudices and access to education. Skateboarding here is part of an answer to complex social conditions in the city.     Children participating in the Skateistan project skateboard in Kabul. Photograph: Skateistan    Oliver Percovich, the Australian skateboarder who founded Skateistan in Kabul and is now its executive director, explains how the children who make up 70% of the population of Afghanistan often have only roadsides in which to play, with girls in particular not being allowed to ride bicycles or climb trees. But they are allowed to skateboard \u2013 hence Skateistan\u2019s efforts to teach boys and girls alike to skateboard alongside an educational arts-based curriculum ranging from world cultures, human rights and environmental studies to nutrition, hygiene and storytelling. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, kids just want to be kids\u201d, explains Percovich. \u201cSkateboarding provides that because it\u2019s fun and challenging. It lets them forget their problems for a moment. Once kids are hooked on skateboarding, so much more is possible, especially in the classroom. Skateboarding itself teaches important life skills, like creativity and problem solving.\u201d Whereas many cities around the world have continued to push skateboarding out from squares, shopping streets and other public areas, they have also had to accept that skateboarding is here to stay. Propelled by the rise of street-based skateboarding since the early 1990s, by the popularity of spectacular events like the X-Games and by pro-skater Tony Hawk\u2019s PlayStation video game, skateboarding has entered the cultural mainstream to become a global phenomenon with tens of millions of active practitioners. It is also a multibillion dollar business, with skate shoe company Vans alone turning over $2bn in 2014. On top of this has come the realisation that skateboarding can be actually a good thing. Apart from the obvious benefits of young skaters doing something that is relatively healthy, affordable and accessible, skateboarding is increasingly being recognised as encouraging a whole series of qualities from creativity and entrepreneurship to resilience, confidence and independence. Countries all over the world are appreciating this, hence the global boom in skatepark construction and other skate-related community initiatives. Through all these ventures, skateboarding is no longer something to be proscribed or repelled. Instead, in the new city skateboarding is increasingly central to debates about the value of public spaces, while simultaneously adding artistic, cultural, educational and commercial value to our urban lives. It is even helping to address some of our most difficult social challenges, and providing hugely disadvantaged children and youths with new hopes, skills and futures. Far from the narrow-minded view of skateboarding as purely countercultural and somehow separate to society, in the new skate city, skateboarding is being celebrated as something diverse, positive and very welcome.

He might have achieved international acclaim for his 2006 TED talk, \u201cDo Schools Kill Creativity?\u201d (now viewed by an estimated 300 million people worldwide), but for more than 40\u00a0years he has persuasively made the case for more creativity in teaching and\u00a0the curriculum, as a\u00a0teacher, government adviser, examiner and academic. Creative Schools brings together this classroom experience and policy ardour in an elegant, powerfully written manifesto for change. And if the book occasionally suffers from an overdose of education conference keynote-ese \u2013 the need for \u201ccuriosity, criticism, communication, collaboration\u201d; the importance of \u201cdiversity, depth, dynamism\u201d \u2013 its informed, avuncular style and unexpected accounts of inspiring teachers more than make up for it. The book is part of a growing public discourse on education policy aimed at\u00a0a data-and-ideas-hungry readership of helicopter parents, engaged practitioners and school innovators. There are Doug Lemov and Pasi Sahlberg on\u00a0teaching, Paul Tough on character, Andrew Adonis on school reform, Anastasia de Waal on selection, Paul\u00a0Marshall on closing the attainment gap. Then there are the blogs, Twitter feeds, Teach-Meets and EdTech geeks. Add to\u00a0that the controversies around international comparisons: Swedish free schools versus Finnish teaching; New Orleans charter schools versus Singapore curriculum reforms. And it is all to be welcomed. The more we discuss education, the better. Not least because such conversations help to highlight the tricky 40-year gap between where policymakers think schooling should be heading (preparing for society 20 years hence) and what the majority of the public thinks schools should be doing (their own halcyon days 20 years past). The role of politicians is\u00a0to seek, consensually and pragmatically, to bridge that divide. But Robinson\u2019s point is that politicians are doing exactly the opposite: scarred by the media reporting of the Pisa international league tables on school performance, they have retreated into a self-defeating cul-de-sac of testing and assessment. As a result, we are\u00a0at risk of inculcating an industrial education system producing compliant, linear pupils. \u201cThe emphasis on testing comes at the expense of teaching children how to employ their natural creativity and entrepreneurial talents \u2013 the precise talents that might insulate them against the unpredictability of the future in all parts of the world.\u201d The prescription is a richer personalisation of learning \u2013 an appreciation of the diversity of intelligence; the need to\u00a0adapt teaching schedules to different learning speeds; a flexibility that allows learners to pursue their interests and strengths; and a different model of assessment. And, as expected, a strong dose of arts education as an essential component of schooling. Through a\u00a0catalogue of test cases \u2013 teaching Shakespeare in LA\u2019s Koreatown; transforming schools in North Carolina under the A+\u00a0arts programme \u2013 Robinson shows how taking the arts seriously is\u00a0particularly rewarding for high-poverty, inner-urban districts. Time and again, the arts engage students and raise standards. If, occasionally, Robinson gets a\u00a0bit\u00a0too Californian \u2013 with his call for \u201corganic education\u201d and extensive flirtation with home-schooling \u2013 his driving critique of the \u201cexam factory\u201d model of schooling is well worth reflecting on. Because, in recent years, English schooling has had too much teaching to the test, too much focus on\u00a0C/D borderline, too many early and multiple entries for examinations. Yet the uncomfortable truth is that there are also large swaths of the English education system that require more not less uniformity. If all our pupils could reach some basic minimum standards of literacy and numeracy by\u00a0the time they left primary schools, our educational attainment as a nation would be markedly higher. Similarly, we need much greater consistency in the professional development and training of teachers. As much as Robinson decries them, this is the clarifying force of comparisons such as the Pisa tables: they show\u00a0how young people in Poland and\u00a0Germany, let alone Shanghai and Singapore, are more advanced in many essential subjects and skills. Robinson rightly makes the case for the\u00a0rigour of creative learning \u2013 \u201ccreativity in any field may involve deep factual knowledge and high levels of practical skill\u201d \u2013 but we always need to\u00a0guard against the soft bigotry of low expectations: the worrying trend of play and expression being adequate for working-class pupils, while leaving the tough stuff, the physics and history, for their better-off\u00a0peers. What I took from Robinson\u2019s impassioned work is the never-ending need for innovation in education. Project-based learning, flipped classrooms, personalised curricula \u2013 all of this is starting to reshape education and the role of teachers. We need to embrace all the exciting, uncomfortable possibilities offered by digital technology. What\u2019s more, no education system exceeds the strength of its teachers. Their ambition, professionalism and subject knowledge are the key variables. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how detailed the curriculum is or how expensive the tests are; the real key to transforming education is the quality of teaching.\u201d The structure of a school is markedly less significant than an effective head teacher, a faculty which embraces change, and quality professional development. We need to call time on the exam-factory model, ensure a broad and balanced curriculum in our schools, and\u00a0focus on improving teaching rather than fruitlessly reforming school structures \u2013 not only because a childhood at school should be a rich, enjoyable and challenging time; but also because the coming economy demands exactly the kind of rigorous creativity and personal resilience that Robinson advocates. \u2022 To order Creative Schools for\u00a0\u00a315.19 (RRP \u00a318.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330\u00a0333\u00a06846.

Residents hurry around on bicycles and scooters, and food vendors do brisk business selling hand-pulled noodles. This is Shanghai\u2019s Old Town, the traditional core of the Chinese city dating back to 1554, when walls were first erected to ward off Japanese pirates preying in nearby waters.  In the street stands a handsome mansion, built in the 1930s by a capitalist called Lin Guisheng, who named it Ximeng Lu, meaning \u201cHope for an Heir\u201d. An elegant mix of European and traditional Chinese designs, the building was reminiscent of early 20th century Shanghai when western influences, a result of foreign concessions that forced the city open, seeped into local culture, design and architecture. Touches of Art Deco motifs line the walls and ceilings; mosaic tiles with Buddhist swastikas cover the floors. A pair of stone lions, traditional Chinese symbols of wealth, sit under the eaves of a balcony. But Ximeng is emblematic of a darker side of Shanghai history that is often forgotten in the wake of rapid urbanisation: during the second Sino-Japanese War in 1938 the mansion was turned into a \u201ccomfort station\u201d, a military brothel where local women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army.    Ximeng is emblematic of a darker side of Shanghai\u200b\u2019s\u200b history that is often forgotten in the wake of rapid urbanisation       Hundreds of thousands of women from China, Korea and other occupied territories were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese army. Peipei Qiu estimates there were 400,000 victims    When the war reached Shanghai \u2013 leaving parts of the city buried in rubble and corpses \u2013 Lin fled for Hong Kong, and his mansion was abandoned to a dark legacy of sexual violence and rape.  For low-ranked soldiers using Ximeng, or one of the hundreds of other \u201ccomfort stations\u201d across China, sex was conducted in one of many rooms with beds placed in rows, separated by thin curtains. One can imagine the sounds of masculine grunts, creaking beds and muffled cries echoing across the wooden stairwell as the women were raped by scores of Japanese soldiers. Strict rules governing soldier behaviour were displayed prominently within the mansion: \u201cThe entrant must register and pay to obtain an entry voucher and a condom\u201d; \u201cThe entry voucher holder must enter the designated room and has an allotted time of 30 minutes\u201d.     Strict regulations were displayed in the so-called \u2018comfort stations\u2019     The women endured routine examinations to prevent the spread of venereal diseases and were given contraception. Some Japanese military personnel even received accountancy classes on \u201chow to manage comfort stations, including how to determine the actuarial \u2018durability or perishability of the women procured\u2019\u201d. Following victory in Shanghai, an emboldened Japanese army marched to the then-capital Nanjing where it unleashed a massacre, killing up to 300,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants. An estimated 20,000 women \u2013 including infants and the elderly \u2013 were raped, with many subsequently mutilated and killed in what became known as the Rape of Nanjing. One reason for Japan\u2019s rolling out of comfort stations across China was to regulate the sexual aggression of its soldiers, and Shanghai was home to an estimated 158 stations, more than any other city in China. After the war ended in 1945 and the Communist party takeover four years later, the mansion resumed its residential purpose in the form of social housing. More than 10 families were assigned rooms in the mansion, a cross-section of political and economic classes crammed under one roof. Families labelled as capitalists were reduced to small rooms in the back, with workers and party members assigned more generous spaces. A descendent of Lin, the original owner, is believed to still live quietly in a small room on the top floor of the mansion.      More than 10 families now live in Ximeng mansion, each occupying a room assigned by the Communist party in 1949.  Photograph: Sue Anne Tay    Over the decades, rooms were further halved to accommodate growing families. This was the reality of communal living across Shanghai, a cheek-by-jowl arrangement that remained largely unchanged even after China opened up post-1979. Housing reform allowed some Shanghainese residents to move out to newer and more spacious properties; they then rent their rooms to migrant families, maintaining the compressed state of affairs. All those living in the building know of its history but uncomfortably try to ignore the aura left behind by the violated women, some of whom killed themselves after the war. Residents endured further trauma during Chairman Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s, when neighbours turned on each other and capitalist families and political opponents were mercilessly attacked, and many died. Few of the older generation like to talk about those times.   Related: The Writers' Building, Kolkata: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 13    Places like Ximeng mansion are bricks and mortar testaments to Shanghai\u2019s tumultuous 20th century history. As the city demolishes vast swaths of old neighbourhoods to usher in gleaming new facades, they represent the dark side of a forgotten history that helped shape the city. Championing the preservation of old houses in Shanghai, whether on the grounds of historical or architectural significance, is bureaucratically challenging and rarely successful, especially when they occupy prime real estate. Residents of Ximeng mansion expect their home will suffer a similar fate in the coming years. There are few calls for the preservation of former comfort stations, with the memorialisation of their victims channelled through official narratives and designated sites. Historian Su Zhiliang, who founded the Research Centre for Chinese Comfort Women at Shanghai Normal University, collects testimonials to campaign for justice and recognition of past atrocities. He has for years called for city authorities to turn Shanghai\u2019s first comfort station into a museum. Like Ximeng mansion, the building is decaying and crowded with families.It is unclear if Su will be successful. Ximeng mansion is another story.

You might struggle: the Canadian port city may be a lovely place to live, but it\u2019s not exactly an exemplar of romance and adventure. When you last saw a film shot in Vancouver, however, is another question: so effectively (and economically) does it pose as a multitude of US cities in major productions that it\u2019s come to be known as Hollywood North. Right now, it\u2019s damply filling in for Seattle in Fifty Shades of Grey, and working overtime in the much-ballyhooed satire The Interview, multitasking as New York, rural China and Pyongyang.

Clint Eastwood, efficient as ever, turned Rabat into a reasonable substitute for the shrapnel-strewn streets of Fallujah in American Sniper, following the likes of Body of Lies and Green Zone.

But he couldn\u2019t have counted on giving the Kiwi tourism racket a whole new lease of life: with the country now forever branded as the real-life Middle-earth by global legions of Tolkienites, the number of themed tours of Queenstown, Matamata and the Southern Alps keeps growing. Neither is it just Hobbit country in the minds of cinemagoers: with the recent run of Narnia films having also rooted themselves here, New Zealand has become a one-stop geek mecca.

David Lean resorted to Cape Town when the drenched coastline of the west of Ireland served up too many logistical obstacles to completing Ryan\u2019s Daughter, while Robert Towne (filming his largely forgotten Colin Farrell noir Ask the Dust) declared that \u201cnothing could look more like southern California\u201d than the country\u2019s tourist capital.  Greystone Mansion, Los Angeles      Scene from There Will Be Blood.    We could have filled this list with the stately English homes that have dutifully served as the backdrop to countless corset dramas, but for sheer versatility they\u2019re arguably outdone by a gauche Beverly Hills pretender. Thanks largely to its immediately recognisable chequerboard floor and grandiose descending staircase, this 1928 Tudor revival sprawl has become a go-to symbol of American aristocracy, serving as the home of Jeffrey Lebowski Sr in The Big Lebowski, the older Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood (including that bowling alley) and even \u2014 briefly \u2014 Kermit the Frog in The Muppets.  Prague      A scene from Amadeus, 1984.

It certainly made for a lavish Vienna in Czech native Milos Forman\u2019s 1984 Oscar-guzzler Amadeus, while Casino Royale called upon it to serve as Venice, London and even Miami. And the Mission: Impossible franchise has made repeat visits to Prague, occasionally allowing the city to play itself \u2013 though the last instalment took the liberty of dressing up Prague castle as the Kremlin.

Monument Valley, Utah     Stagecoach. Photograph: JTavin/Everett/REX    Sometimes the American west does a perfectly fine job of representing itself. Case in point: the vast, eerie sandstone buttes of Monument Valley on the Arizona-Utah state line, an iconic location first put on the Hollywood map by John Ford\u2019s Stagecoach in 1939. Ford, after whom one of the region\u2019s key lookout points is now named, would return there for nine more westerns, including The Searchers, while Easy Rider, Thelma &amp; Louise and Forrest Gump are among the films to have followed his lead. No film-maker made more of the valley\u2019s otherworldly potential than Stanley Kubrick; in 2001: A Space Odyssey, that\u2019s the alien planet waiting at the end of the stargate sequence.

And few of its resources have been more exhaustively explored than this 4,310-acre municipal park in Santa Monica: with its caves, cedar groves, winding back roads, carousel and landmark conservatory, it\u2019s an all-purpose godsend for travel-shy location scouts. DW Griffith used it for the battle scenes in The Birth of a Nation a century ago, John Ford (again) borrowed the caves for the climax of The Searchers, and the imposingly domed conservatory will forever be associated with Nicholas Ray\u2019s Rebel Without a Cause. Almer\u00eda, Spain      Clint Eastwood in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.

It used to run a review every three years. Then, in 2012, it postponed the question indefinitely, arguing that too many other things were happening \u2013 like regulators\u2019 evolving plans to ensure the next banking crisis does not have the damaging consequences of the 2007-2009 catastrophe. Now HSBC has waltzed back onto the dancefloor. \u201cWe are beginning to see the final shape of regulation and of structural reform,\u201d says chairman Douglas Flint. So yet another review has been ordered to answer this \u201ccomplex\u201d question. Is it really that complex? One point is very simple. Even in the new regulatory environment of fatter capital cushions, big banks need to be domiciled in big countries. If not, investors will worry that the home state can\u2019t fund a bailout in a crisis. Bondholders would then demand a higher price to lend. Iceland was bust by its banks. Royal Bank of Scotland would have done much the same to an independent Scotland. In HSBC\u2019s case, there are only two possible homes, other than the UK \u2013 the US or China/Hong Kong. The US is surely a non-starter. HSBC operates there under a deferred prosecution agreement, a result of its money-laundering for Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, for which it was fined $1.9n in 2012. It\u2019s hard to believe HSBC would wish to be American.   Related: HSBC warns of economic risks of UK pulling out of Europe    That leaves China/Hong Kong, which is where the bank\u2019s roots lie. The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation moved to the UK in 1992 with its purchase of Midland Bank. The UK authorities demanded the redomicile but it was also seen as a smart piece of planning since Hong Kong was being handed back to China in 1999 with unknown consequences. So why is UK suddenly seen as less attractive? Flint\u2019s mention of \u201cthe shape of regulation\u201d is partly code for the bank levy, introduced by chancellor George Osborne. This is calculated on a UK-domiciled bank\u2019s global assets \u2013 not just those in this country \u2013 so an international operator gets hit disproportionately. All the main political parties are committed to the levy (and Labour is arguing for an increase) and analysts at Investec reckon HSBC\u2019s charge could rise from $1.1bn (\u00a3660m) in 2014 to $1.6bn in 2015 as a result of an increase in the budget in March. If HSBC was based in Hong Kong or Shanghai \u2013 and thus only its UK business was eligible for the levy \u2013 the bank would escape about two thirds of the charge. Flint also mentioned the UK\u2019s new ring-fencing rules today. These require a separation of the UK bank and dedicated capital cushions. HSBC\u2019s thought might be this: we are reorganising our UK business anyway and moving it from London to Birmingham, so why not go the full hog and shift the headquarters of the rest of the bank? The problem is this. The mists, as Flint calls them, are clearing around regulation but HSBC would he heading into a thick smog if went eastwards. In the UK, banks are regulated by a body accountable to a democratically elected parliament in a country that operates an open system of justice. Hong Kong may still love its financiers and tycoons but the UK\u2019s former colony comes under the increasingly watchful gaze of the Chinese Communist party. Could HSBC \u2013 or anybody \u2013 really know how the Hong Kong political landscape will look 20 years from now? That, at a minimum, is the horizon Flint &amp; co should be considering. No doubt there will be a strong lobby within HSBC arguing the case for Hong Kong or China. Most of the group\u2019s profits are made in Asia, and the locals feel HSBC never really left, spiritually speaking. But the costs and upheaval of such a move would be enormous. HSBC is vastly bigger than it was in 1992 and regulators\u2019 demands have multiplied. But the basic problem is straightforward: China and Hong Kong might look pretty today, but HSBC would risk making itself a slave to an undemocratic regime in Beijing.  The idea seems mad.

The bank employs about 48,000 people in the UK of 266,000 globally, according to its annual report. About 8,500 employees are based at the Sir Norman Foster-designed head office at Canary Wharf. Most of the bank\u2019s remaining UK staff work for HSBC\u2019s retail and commercial bank.  But it is more than taxes and jobs. Despite recent damage to its reputation, such as the tax scandal at its Swiss operation, HSBC\u2019s presence helps support the idea that Britain is a big player in international finance. Peter Hahn, a lecturer in finance at Cass Business School, said there would be a big effect on the City\u2019s standing and also on the wider economy if HSBC left. \u201cThere would be a huge psychological effect. In HSBC leaving London you would start to wonder how long they would want to hold on to their UK bank,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are no big international banks from Britain, it isn\u2019t good for the rest of the economy. We are trying to get more small and medium-sized companies to export but we are going to have a banking system that is focused on making mortgage loans. Who is going to help successful middle-sized companies to export?\u201d HSBC has been a fixture in the UK for more than two decades but for most of its 150 years it made almost all its money in Asia. Last year, 78% of HSBC\u2019s $18.7bn group profit came from Asia. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was founded in 1865 in Hong Kong to finance trade between Asia and Europe. The bank expanded throughout Asia and into the US but it was not until 1992 that HSBC gained a big presence in Britain.  Under Sir Willie Purves, then chairman, it bought Midland Bank, which was in financial trouble, before the planned handover of Hong Kong to China. The deal to buy one of Britain\u2019s big four clearing banks was one of the largest in the industry. HSBC moved its headquarters to London the following year. By the late 1990s, HSBC had replaced Midland\u2019s Griffin logo with its own red and white hexagon design as HSBC branded itself \u201cthe world\u2019s local bank\u201d. HSBC has announced that its UK retail bank\u2019s head office will move to Birmingham because of the government\u2019s policy of dividing retail and investment banking. Now there is talk that HSBC could split off the retail bank, possibly under the Midland name, to refocus on Asia. At the turn of the millennium, HSBC vied with Citigroup of the US to be the biggest bank in the world with operations spanning Asia, Europe and the Americas. Despite its size and power, HSBC was regarded as a conservatively run commercial bank with little time for risky ventures. Purves was one of a long line of canny Brits \u2013 often Scots \u2013 with a military bearing to preside over the bank. That changed in the early 2000s when Sir John Bond, who replaced Purves in 1998, bought Bital, a Mexican bank, in 2002; Household International, a US subprime lender, the following year; and Republic, a private bank, from the billionaire banker Edmond Safra in 1999. Each of those deals came back to haunt HSBC. The Mexican operation became a hub for drug gangs\u2019 money laundering; Household lost billions in the subprime mortgage crisis; and Republic\u2019s Swiss operation was revealed by the Guardian to have enabled tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance by its rich clients.

The former marketing man revealed last week that his largest stores, seen by many as the dinosaurs of retail, had shown the fastest recovery of all the chain\u2019s formats in the past three months. It was a valiant effort to project a positive message as he unveiled a towering \u00a36.4bn loss for the UK\u2019s biggest retailer. Lewis suggested the much-touted trend towards convenience shopping could just as well mean shoppers head for one big store that provides every need, rather than nipping to several places that are handy and local. Perhaps he\u2019s right. During the past few years of tough economic times, people have been much more prepared to shop around to ensure they are getting a bargain. It has been about saving money on petrol by sticking close to home and finding ways to use up leftovers, rather than grabbing a two-for-one deal. People have avoided the temptations of large stores that offer everything from T-shirts to televisions alongside the teabags. So it could be that when people have a little more money in their pockets, their time will become more valuable than saving a few quid. As Aldi and Lidl\u2019s stores get more busy, shoppers may tire of queueing, hunting for a parking space, paying for a plastic bag. Lewis had better hope so. With more enormous stores than any other supermarket chain, he has little choice but to place his bets on their revival. Thanks to Terry Leahy\u2019s hopes of world domination, Tesco is stuck with oversized stores from South Korea to Salisbury, via Turkey. Despite the improvement in performance at its UK hypermarkets Tesco\u2019s figures still underline how the tectonic shifts going on in the UK market favour small over large. Like-for-like sales slid 2.5% at its superstores, which are an average of 40,000 sq ft, and 2.2% at its biggest stores, which can be two and a half times that size. In contrast, sales at the Express convenience stores rose 4.5%, excluding new store openings. Online grocery sales rose 11.5%. Internet sales of things other than food soared by 14.3%. The improvement in performance Lewis heralded at those large stores was won largely by taking an axe to prices and spending millions paying more staff to be on the shop floor. As a result the UK\u2019s largest retailer, once seen as unassailable, stopped making money on day-to-day trading in the second half of its financial year \u2013 falling \u00a332m into the red, according to analysts. Commodity prices are expected to fall for much of this year and with discounters opening dozens of stores there is unlikely to be any let-up in the intensity of competition. Lewis spent about \u00a3200m trimming prices and improving service last year; this year he warned he was likely to have to spend even more. With profit margins shot to pieces, Lewis has a mountain to climb even to reach his \u201caspiration\u201d of merely matching last year\u2019s operating profit. Meanwhile, he must engineer a complete change in culture. He has to wean Tesco off the heady drug of supplier income that led it to paying less attention to giving shoppers what they wanted in favour of developing creative ways to charge brands and manufacturers for access to consumers. Lewis admitted he could not say how long the rebuild would take. Performance in the year ahead could be volatile and bumpy. Some might suspect that the hard truth about being the UK\u2019s biggest retailer is that the only way is down. Can Lewis prove them wrong? To do so he should be able to use Tesco\u2019s size to its advantage, commanding the best prices and services for its shoppers. He will have to convince them that those giant stores are not dinosaurs, unable to adapt to a world that has changed. It would take a hell of a lot of tiny corner shops to replace them. Global economy can\u2019t raise a smile The Federal Reserve meets this week to discuss whether to start raising interest rates in the US. Wall Street is not seriously expecting the Fed to act now, but a month or so ago the feeling was that it would send out a strong signal that the first increase in borrowing costs since before the financial crisis would take place in June. But the recent softness in the world\u2019s biggest economy has led to a rethink. The collapse in the oil price in the second half of 2014 was the equivalent of a tax cut for individuals and businesses, but both consumer and business spending have been weak. Interest rates in the US are now seen as being on hold until at least September. Some analysts put the sluggishness of the US economy down to a harsh winter. But this doesn\u2019t explain why business surveys from the rest of the world have also pointed to slower-than-expected growth in the months ahead. Manufacturing in China is clearly struggling. Japan is struggling despite the massive stimulus provided by Shinzo Abe\u2019s \u201cthree-arrow\u201d policy. The one part of the global economy where the outlook has brightened since the turn of the year is the eurozone, but there is no guarantee that the fledgling recovery will survive the deepening of the crisis in Greece. Looking around the world, it is easy to see why the former US treasury secretary Larry Summers talks about secular stagnation, a structural decline in the trend rate of growth. By this point in every previous postwar economic cycle, policy would have had to be tightened, often quite aggressively, to curb excess demand and inflationary pressure. This time, after almost seven years in which interest rates have been tiny, central banks have turned on the electronic printing presses and the oil price has halved, it has been a different story. The global economy has failed to achieve escape velocity and inflation is low. All this suggests a deep economic malaise. Until a solution is found for it, policymakers will be wary of taking their foot off the accelerator. HSBC may chicken out of flying the coop HSBC should be careful what it wishes for. When bankers threaten to quit the UK, the man on the street might celebrate. Where might HSBC prefer to be located? Not the US, where the bank was caught laundering billions on behalf of Mexican drug cartels. Not a big eurozone country, with the EU\u2019s hostile attitude to bankers\u2019 bonuses, nor Switzerland, where it is mired in allegations of client tax avoidance on an industrial scale. Hong Kong and Shanghai pose far more political risk than London. Neither will \u201cringfencing\u201d its UK arm, if HSBC departs these shores, be acceptable to the Bank of England. It will demand more supervisory control of a bank at the heart of the British financial system. Remember how Prudential\u2019s ambitions in Hong Kong were stymied by regulators in London.

In one corner stood Dennis Kimetto, the world record holder. In the other was Wilson Kipsang, the reigning London marathon champion. But a third Kenyan, Eliud Kipchoge, provided a thrilling upset by proving stronger than both of his highly touted rivals, racing prominently throughout before motoring away from Kipsang in an exciting finale to win by five seconds in 2hr 4min 42sec. The 30-year-old Kipchoge was talented enough to win world championship 5,000m gold as an 18-year-old and also took Olympic bronze in 2004 and silver in 2008. He has also run a razor-sharp 3min 33sec over 1500m. So when the race entered the last four miles with four Kenyans \u2013 Kipsang, Kimetto, Kipchoge and Stanley Biwott \u2013 duking it out, he looked like the man to be on. But Kipsang did not let go easily, matching him stride for stride until Kipchoge\u2019s extra gear allowed him to pull clear in the final 800m. Kimetto was third in 2:05:50. Kipchoge had won three of his four previous marathons, including Chicago and Rotterdam last year. But this victory against such a muscular field \u2013 including the three fastest marathon runners of all time, five of the world\u2019s all-time top 10 and eight men who have run under 2hr 5min \u2013 was on a different plane. \u201cThis was like a major championship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like an Olympic Games. I was a little bit scared at my competition but I was very confident by the time we got to 40km.\u201d Kipsang, meanwhile, paid tribute to his opponent but said he wished the earlier pace had been quicker. The pacemakers were due to arrive at halfway in 61m 45sec but ended up 35 seconds slower. \u201cI am happy for my friend,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was a very hard race but a fantastic one. But our aim was to run a course record.\u201d Kipchoge, Kipsang and Kimetto all said afterwards that they would like to run in the world championships in Beijing in August. Assuming they are picked \u2013 never a given with Athletics Kenya \u2013 Kenya, will as usual, hold the whip hand. The start on London\u2019s greased roads was lightning. The first three miles were covered in 14min 31sec \u2013 exactly 2hr03min pace and a smidge outside Kimetto\u2019s world record. But from then on the race became bitty, with surges in pace and quieter, more strategic, periods as the runners considered whether to stick or twist. After 19 miles the leading bunch was down to five and one could still have thrown a blanket over the pack as they headed towards the Thames. Five became four with four miles to go and when the runners emerged from the tunnel between miles 23 and 24, Kipsang and Kipchoge had surged 30m clear. It was nip and tuck after that but Kipchoge had the more violent kick at the end, as one suspected he might. Before the women\u2019s race there was warm talk of a possible challenge on Paula Radcliffe\u2019s women-only world record of 2:17:42m, set in 2005. The first mile of the race, run in 5min 40sec put paid to that. Radcliffe had done it in 5min 03sec. And there was another surprise as the anticipated \u201cFantastic Four\u201d race between the leading Kenyan challengers fizzled out and Tigist Tufa provided Ethiopia with a shock victory in 2:23:22. The 27-year-old Tufa made her marathon debut in a modest 2:41.50 in Houston four years ago but she has been steadily improving since. Last year she showed her talent by winning the Shanghai marathon in 2:21.50 but few expectedher to be a serious contender here. But from 35km to 40km she put in an impressive surge to leave her rivals floundering. The pre-race favourite Mary Keitany, the second fastest women in history behind Radcliffe, did her best to respond but she never looked like bridging the gap before settling for second. Meanwhile in the men\u2019s wheelchair race, David Weir, going for a record seventh London victory, was pipped on the line by the American Joshua George. Weir, whose great rival Marcel Hug had to withdraw having punctured just before halfway, appeared to have the advantage on the final straight but lost out by a second.

It was an audacious bid that not only put HSBC on the map in Europe but forced the bank to relocate its head office from Hong Kong to London. Almost a quarter of a century later, Britain\u2019s biggest bank is considering whether to migrate once more and move its head office from its 50-storey tower in Canary Wharf. The bank, which has a foothold in 70 countries and employs 266,000 peopleincluding 48,000 in the UK, is likely to consider several factors in determining whether London is a better location than, say, Hong Kong or Sydney. Its shares jumped on Friday when the review was announced, and continued to rise on Monday, pulling Standard Chartered \u2013 the London-based, Asian-focused bank \u2013 along too. In Hong Kong, where HSBC\u2019s shares are also listed, daily trading volume was the second highest recorded. But, while the share prices may be jumping, there is also some scepticism in the City about the prospect of HSBC moving its head office, at least in the next five years. Analysts at UBS said the possibility of such a move by either HSBC or Standard Chartered was unlikely in the short term. \u201cWe attribute the rationale for statements in this regard as being more a reminder to UK politicians ahead of the UK election than a message of serious intent.\u201d Here are the factors at play in HSBC\u2019s decision on whether to relocate.      The UK headquarters of HSBC in London\u2019s Canary Wharf. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images    The bank levy George Osborne\u2019s bank levy is on the size of banks\u2019 balance sheets, regardless of whether the assets and liabilities are located in the UK. The burden falls heaviest on HSBC, which paid $1.1bn (\u00a3700m) to the exchequer in 2014 and as a result of a rise in the levy announced by the chancellor in his budget, it could reach $1.4bn. Analysts at UBS calculate this is equivalent to 6% of pre-tax profits. HSBC points out that 58% of the levy it pays does not relate to its activities in the UK. HSBC\u2019s contribution is approximately a quarter of the annual proceeds from the levy, which was introduced after taxpayers bailed out banks during the financial crisis. Ringfencing banks The requirement for banks to ringfence their high street operations from their investment banking arms is another fallout from the 2008 banking crisis. The rules come into force in 2019 and in anticipation HSBC has  announced it will move 1,000 staff to Birmingham \u2013 the old base of Midland bank \u2013 to run the retail and business banking operation inside the ringfence. Stuart Gulliver, the bank\u2019s chief executive, told the annual general meeting last Friday that the location in Birmingham \u201cunderlined our commitment to communities throughout the UK and brings our ambition of becoming the bank of choice in the UK a step closer\u201d. Even so, speculation is rife that HSBC could spin out the retail business. Speaking on the sidelines of the bank\u2019s AGM, HSBC non-executive director Sir Simon Robertson told reporters that the ringfenced bank would become little more than an equity investment once the Vickers rules kicked in, because of the lack of direct control. \u201cIt changes the dynamics,\u201d said Robertson. Analysts at Credit Suisse calculate that if HSBC were to spin off the UK arm it would \u201cgive up a significant source of earnings\u201d. \u201cAs such, we expect a full UK separation would dilute returns,\u201d they said. A clampdown on wrongdoing  New rules which reverse the burden of proof in bank collapses, by requiring senior bankers to prove their innocence, may also have an influence. A new authorisation regime in the City is also putting more emphasis on the responsibility of senior individuals running banks.  A possible EU referendum     HSBC Group chairman Douglas Flint. Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters    Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, told investors at the AGM: \u201cOne economic uncertainty stands out, that of continuing UK membership of the EU.\u201d This could become clearer for HSBC after the general election because the Conservative party has promised an in-out referendum, so this uncertainty will be settled before the outcome of the headquarter review.  On the sidelines of the AGM, Flint insisted the review of the headquarters was not driven by politics. \u201cHow other people interpret it is up to them,\u201d he said.   Related: HSBC leads FTSE towards new record on talk of UK bank spin-off    Strategy review and regulatory overhang On 9 June, a month after first-quarter results, Gulliver will present the outcome of a strategy review. Investors are looking for an update on underperforming parts of the business: the US, Mexico, Brazil and Turkey. Gulliver has already pulled HSBC out of 14 countries since taking the helm in 2011. But, despite his mantra of running the bank with \u201ccourageous integrity\u201d, he has been embroiled in the scandal in the bank\u2019s Swiss arm. The Guardian and other publications published details of leaked accounts showing how the bank had helped customers avoid and evade tax.  Addressing shareholders at the AGM, Gulliver emphasised that the bank was subject to a deferred prosecution agreement with the US Department of Justice as a result of the \u00a31.2bn fine in 2012 for money laundering offences. There are suggestions that the close oversight of the US authorities under the agreement could affect whether other jurisdictions will welcome HSBC. The Hong Kong authorities, however, have said they would look favourably upon a return of HSBC. Even so, the UBS analysts said: \u201cAlthough Hong Kong is an obvious head-office location for HSBC and Standard Chartered, the issue will come down to the size of both banks relative to Hong Kong GDP and the broader role of Hong Kong versus Shanghai in terms of the longer-term positioning of the Chinese financial system.\u201d A counter argument is that HSBC has been designated, in regulatory jargon, a global systemically important financial institution. This means that it is holding a bigger capital cushion than it did before the 2008 crisis, which is intended to reduce the need for one of the world\u2019s biggest banks to rely on government support. This is probably a relief to the Hong Kong authorities, given that HSBC\u2019s balance sheet is nine times the size of the territory\u2019s GDP.

The hundreds of eager locals I found myself waiting among, in the middle of a weekday afternoon, were poised to receive their first taste of Japanese cheesecake \u2013 and, no less attractively, their first glimpse of a citywide trend. It\u2019s a long time to stand in line for dessert. But it\u2019s a small sacrifice indeed to participate in a bona fide craze.

The restaurant has been open about a month now, and the queue never dwindles. At any hour, a few hundred of the city\u2019s hungry and curious can be counted on to patiently wait.  When I went, the line seemed to loom from three blocks away. A friend I\u2019d invited along arrived a few moments before me, and by the time I joined him a half-dozen stragglers were already snaking behind. By the time we actually moved forward a step, the line seemed to have doubled.  The crowd was an affable mix of teenaged tourists and local office workers enjoying an extended lunch hour \u2013 the only sort of people, I suppose, able to squander 90 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon. People busied themselves on their phones \u2013 the Tetsu queue is a popular subject of Instagram photography \u2013 or shared rumors about how long friends and colleagues had waited for their cheesecakes on afternoons prior. A pair of computer programmers behind me speculated that in another month or two the novelty of the cheesecake would be exhausted. A lot of people mentioned the cronut. Every few minutes someone passing by would stop to ask what everybody was lining up for. One of us would sheepishly mutter something about Japan. The bold among us steeled themselves preemptively against the judgment of passersby. But I suspect most of us simply believed that we were there for more than just dessert: we were there for an event, something grand and communal.  My friend and I at last stepped into the Tetsu storefront. On the wall, greeting the lucky survivors, was a large cartoon modeled on Tetsu, beaming joyously. \u201cI like excitement very much!\u201d reads a speech bubble beside him. \u201cI\u2019m of medium height and a little fat, always wearing a jersey with flip-flops.\u201d Suddenly, a medium-sized fat man in a jersey and flip-flops shuffled into the restaurant \u2013 a remarkable likeness. \u201cIt\u2019s Uncle Tetsu!\u201d a little girl screamed. In short order, I received my prize: a six-inch cheesecake so fresh it was practically luminescent, stamped with the likeness of the Tetsu cartoon.  Have you ever eaten a slightly undercooked piece of french toast? That\u2019s what Japanese cheesecake tastes like, not unpleasantly. It\u2019s like a sweet, soggy quiche. I would eat another, I think, though perhaps not until the fervor winds down a little.  The question of whether something like this was worth the wait strikes me as beside the point. An hour and a half in line has a funny way of conferring upon anything an aura of significance \u2013 and an expectation that, if it can\u2019t be fulfilled by what you\u2019ve waited for, it is by the very act of having waited.

Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto, 52 (Malaysia) Exposto, from Melbourne, was arrested on 7 December 2014 after arriving at Kuala Lumpur airport, en route from Shanghai to Melbourne, with a bag authorities said contained 1.5kg of crystal methamphetamine. Exposto\u2019s lawyer, Tania Scivetti, confirmed to Guardian Australia that a chemical analysis of the substance would be submitted to court on Thursday, after which the case would probably move to the high court for a May hearing.  Malaysian law carries a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. Three Australian nationals have been executed by the state: Michael McAuliffe in 1993, and Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in 1986.

Tell me what you want, how much you want, then we can talk about price, we can talk about shipment.\u201d In the last decade, the global trade in drugs has changed in profound and unpredictable ways. The reality of drugs in the digital age is that on deep web markets any illegal drug, from marijuana to methamphetamine, is a click or two away.      The production process for a legal high. Photograph: Nicola Davison for the Guardian    Meanwhile the newly interconnected, globalised drugs scene has grown too complex and fractured for existing laws to control \u2013 a situation vividly illustrated by the rapid emergence of \u201clegal highs\u201d, or what official bodies call novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Legal highs are chemical compounds synthesised in labs that stimulate or depress the central nervous system in a way that mimics banned substances such as cannabis or cocaine. Chemists tinker with the structure of NPS compounds so that they fall outside international drug controls \u2013 at least when they first emerge.  And more of them are reaching the market every year: since 2009, the number, type and availability of these drugs has seen an \u201cunprecedented increase\u201d, according to a report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). Scores of new substances are reported in Europe and the US each year, and drug control agencies have now categorised more than 400 substances.  Drug policies in consumer countries such as the US and UK were conceived long before the internet and globalisation radically transformed the drugs market.  The deluge of toxic substances, hyperventilating media coverage and a recent spate of hospitalisations have shattered any illusion of government control. In the last month, New York, Mississippi and Alabama have all issued state health alerts following a dramatic rise in NPS overdoses, while Arizona, Florida, New Jersey and Texas report a similar surge. In Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, where one person died and two dozen were hospitalised after taking \u201cspice,\u201d police declared a public safety crisis. Curtailing NPS has been a \u201cpriority\u201d for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) since 2012, but last year one in five Americans told the Global Drugs Survey that they had taken a legal high in the last year \u2013 more than any other country in the world.     A pack of Spice Gold.  Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    All this has happened in a relatively short time. The mass production of legal highs began only in 2008, when UN drugs officials destroyed 33 tonnes of safrole oil, a precursor of MDMA, in Cambodia.  As MDMA stocks in Europe dwindled, suppliers shopped around for an alternative \u2013 and found mephedrone, a substance that was chemically similar to MDMA but not controlled in the UK. For the two years before it was banned, users could not get enough of this cheap, cocaine-meets-ecstasy high. Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer originally developed synthetic cannabinoids \u2013 drugs designed to mimic the effect of cannabis \u2013 as research tools to investigate the mechanisms of the brain\u2019s endocannabinoid system for clinical therapy.  Vendors began trawling obscure scientific journals for compounds, consumers described their highs on online drug forums, and the nascent market took shape. Wholesale importers in the UK, US and Europe put in bulk orders from chemical companies to be delivered through the post or by international couriers.  China has long been the world\u2019s factory for anything from iPhones to Christmas tree lights, so it was perhaps inevitable that it would fill the same role for drugs: local labs churn out huge amounts of chemicals for legitimate pharmaceutical or industrial purposes \u2013 so it was not hard for importers to find dozens of firms in Shanghai able to produce vast quantities of legal highs.  Local officials, if adequately bribed, would look the other way; the Chinese government was more concerned with rising domestic consumption of banned drugs than chemicals that are legal and headed abroad. China, as one headline in Time magazine put it, soon became the \u201cnew front in the global drug war\u201d.  I had been emailing another Shanghai chemist named \u201cCharles\u201d for months about a hypothetical order of a cannabinoid called AB-Chminaca (AB-C), a substance which is banned in the US, but not the UK. The headquarters of his company is on the 12th floor of a near-deserted office building on the edge of the city. On arrival, I am ushered into a meeting room and given a paper cup of steaming, loose-leaf green tea.  Charles\u2019s company will sell 1kg of AB-C for \u00a31,120 ($1,720). On a UK vendor site, 10g costs \u00a360 ($92). Based on this sales price, the vendor makes \u00a34,880 ($7,500) profit per kilogramme before shipping, processing and packaging.  I ask whether Charles can guarantee delivery. \u201cWe divide into one kilo packages and can ship all in one day,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you write down a couple of addresses, I can deliver 50 kilos.\u201d After a lunch of prawns with rice noodles and pumpkin \u2013 Charles chain smokes throughout \u2013 we drive across the city to an industrial park in the district of Pudong.  At the door a chubby woman in her 30s with cropped hair and a white coat greets us: she is the head chemist. We walk through a spotless lab of quietly industrious technicians (\u201cI like a clean lab, I\u2019m a girl,\u201d says the chemist) to an expensive-looking machine that performs gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. \u201cOur purity is above 99%,\u201d she says with pride. A large plastic bag contains some 50 samples of off-white powders and crystals \u2013 stimulants, depressants, opioids. We sit down to talk. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this [compound] is not good,\u201d the chemist says in accented English. \u201cFirstly, somebody give us the feedback that it\u2019s not strong. Second, it seems it has already [caused] dead in Russia. Do you know the news? So why do you still want it?\u201d She has a theory that the drug\u2019s uneven performance is the result of clumsy synthesis, of molecules substituted in the wrong places. Does she know anything about its potency? \u201cWe know nothing about the performance side,\u201d she says, hastily. \u201cWe are just chemists.\u201d  AB-C was first mentioned on drugs forums in early 2014. As a synthetic cannabinoid it is one of the most popular types of NPS and is a derivative, or close chemical cousin, of AB-Fubinaca, a substance banned in February 2014 in the US. Cannabinoids are designed to work in the same way as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the constituent of cannabis that acts on receptors in the brain to produce a psychoactive effect, or a high.  Today they are typically dissolved in solvents and sprayed on plant material before being packaged in 1g-3g foil packets with brand names such as Spice, K2 and Herbal Haze. They are labelled as \u201cincense\u201d, \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d or \u201cpotpourri\u201d and marked not for human consumption so as to be sold legally in convenience stores, head shops or online. Vendors do not include dosage advice to avoid condoning use and breaking the law. In order to keep ahead of legal control, the NPS market must constantly evolve: a small variation on the chemical structure of a banned drug allows the new substance to skirt most legislation \u2013 but this tiniest molecular tweak can create a drug with dramatically different psychoactive effects.  AB-C is active at a far lower dose than its parent compound, so mistakes are easily made. In a February post on an online drug forum, one user \u2013 who described himself as \u201cvery experienced\u201d \u2013 described his accidental overdose of AB-C: \u201cI drop onto my bed, towel over my face, wet hair, wet body, split naked, open windows at freezing point, blankets underneith [sic] me, I couldn\u2019t care less. I\u2019m so stoned, so so stoned \u2026 Am I gonna die?\u201d     AB-Chminaca, one of the most popular types of legal highs. Photograph: Nicola Davison for the Guardian    Under a haze of misinformation, the reality is that most people smoke whatever \u201cspice\u201d comes in the packet.  On 2 April, Alan Jones, chair of the emergency department at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, received a phone call from a nurse in the ER. \u201cShe told me that we were receiving our fourth patient by ambulance who had reportedly used spice \u2013 the fourth patient in two hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t typically see that.\u201d  Over the next 72 hours, a further 25 patients arrived, and Dr Jones notified the state health department. \u201cI have been working in emergency medicine for almost 20 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he says. Since early April, more than 500 people from almost every county in Mississippi have sought emergency medical treatment after overdosing on spice. The youngest patient seen at the hospital was 14.  Most arrive hallucinating, agitated and profusely sweating. Often, because they are confused, they are violent. \u201cA couple of patients have had problems with their breathing \u2013 not breathing sufficiently to maintain life,\u201d Dr Jones says.  A toxicological analysis of the Mississippi compound identified MAB-Chminaca, an AB-C derivative.  Since the DEA first encountered AB-C in March 2014 it has caused at least four deaths in the US. Adverse effects from taking the drug includes coma, loss of motor control, difficulty breathing and convulsions, according to the DEA notice that temporarily banned AB-C and two other cannabinoids in December 21014. (AB-C is legal to sell in the UK.)  Soon after the ban, users of online drug forums started discussing which compounds could be \u201ccompared to or better than\u201d AB-C. MAB-Chminaca was considered a sound alternative, and the endless \u201cgame of whack-a-mole\u201d, as one DEA official has put it, continued.      \u2018I have been working in emergency medicine for almost 20 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this\u2019, said Jackson doctor when nearly 30 patients arrived within 72 hours after overdosing on \u2018spice\u2019. Photograph: Thomas Wells/Reuters    The emergence of NPS has created an unprecedented challenge for drug policymakers worldwide. The current global prohibition on drugs was established by UN treaties dating back to the 1960s and has been incorporated into the domestic laws of 150 countries. Its roots are in the US prohibition of alcohol 1920-32, a costly experiment that failed to stop people drinking and instead fuelled a black market in moonshine run by rapacious gangs.  In 1971, US president Richard Nixon rebranded prohibition as a \u201cwar on drugs\u201d. Within prohibition, the UK and US use subtly different legislation, though neither approach has successfully stemmed NPS.  The US \u201canalogue\u201d controls can designate a substance not named in legislation illegal if it is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to a drug already controlled \u2013 a system criticised for being ambiguous. In contrast, the UK\u2019s \u201cgeneric\u201d controls list individual drugs or families on the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), a body of scientists, academics, police and other experts.  But this system proved too clunky \u2013 it could take months for the experts to conclude a drug was unsafe \u2013 so in 2011 the UK introduced new measures called Temporary Class Drug Orders, allowing the government to temporarily ban a substance while evaluating its harms. Despite these measures, only 60% of known cannabinoids are currently controlled in the UK.   Related: The North Korean Walter Whites funnelling crystal meth into China    Danny Kushlick, head of external affairs at Transform, a British drugs reform thinktank, calls the UK\u2019s legislative response to NPS \u201cterrible\u201d.  One of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of prohibition, according to the UN\u2019s Office on Drugs and Crime, is \u201csubstance displacement\u201d, whereby the control of one substance causes suppliers and users to move to another drug with similar effects but fewer controls.  \u201cLegal highs appear to have arisen because of success in the enforcement on the supply side for cocaine and ecstasy particularly,\u201d Kushlick says. \u201cThe demand remains and the entrepreneurs, whether they be criminal or legit, move in to exploit that demand.\u201d Mike Power, author of Drugs 2.0, argues that the answer to the legal high dilemma does not lie in punitive controls and the annual spending of millions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars. Drugs law should be progressively dismantled, he says, recommending the introduction of a controlled, regulated market of cannabis as seen in Colorado.  \u201cThe strength and potency of the drug would be limited by law, with accurate labelling and age requirements for prospective users demanded as we currently have with alcohol,\u201d he says. Kushlick, too, advocates legalising the more benign substances. \u201cWhen prohibition goes and we have legally regulated markets for drugs that have been used, in the case of cannabis, for millennia, people will choose to use those,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would you want to use a random white powder?\u201d", "tags": ["Legal highs", "Drugs trade", "Drugs policy", "China", "Drugs", "Politics", "Society", "World news", "Science", "Drugs", "UK news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-01T10:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/04/china-labor-pollution-smog-labor-under-the-dome", "sentences": ["There\u2019s no denying the devastating, nearly incomprehensible levels of smog in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai and many other Chinese cities \u2013 the pollution is so bad that you can even see it from space.", "Connecting efforts to eliminate pollution with the operating budgets of local governments has already unleashed a wave of fines \u2013 one of McDonald\u2019s French fries suppliers received a record 3.9m yuan ($629,000) fine for water pollution in Shanghai last month \u2013 which may deter current or would-be polluters."], "title": "China tackles pollution, but has long way to go on labor", "article": "Air pollution is easily China\u2019s best-recognized environmental challenge. There\u2019s no denying the devastating, nearly incomprehensible levels of smog in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai and many other Chinese cities \u2013 the pollution is so bad that you can even see it from space.  But pollution is only the beginning of China\u2019s problems resulting from the country\u2019s headlong race into economic development. Take your pick: water pollution, challenges to political and religious freedom, soil pollution, human rights problems, desertification, cancer villages and more. China has only recently begun to take stock of the true costs of its advance into economic powerdom. But intense domestic and international attention to China\u2019s air quality, exemplified by the recent release of the documentary Under the Dome in February, may well be remembered as a tipping point for environmental action in China. Under the Dome, a 100-minute, Inconvenient Truth-style documentary, paints a stark picture of the toll pollution is taking on Chinese people. The film by Chai Jing, which was released online on 28 February, was viewed more than 100m times in the first three days. The Chinese government first praised the film for raising important issues, then abruptly moved to halt coverage or discussion of the film by media outlets in China.    Related: Brazil struggles with drought and pollution as Olympics loom large    But it was too late: the discussion had already started. The first work day after the documentary aired, more than a dozen Chinese clean tech companies saw their stock prices surge, notably electric vehicle manufacturer BYD and pollution monitoring company Sail Hero. While China\u2019s neighbor, Russia, has long had strong environmental protection laws on the books but hasn\u2019t enforced them, China has recently made big strides in strengthening its environmental laws as well as enforcing them.  In January, the country significantly upgraded its Environmental Protection Law, enabling local governments to fine polluters on an ongoing, daily basis until the problems are fixed, and eliminating a cap on those fines. Connecting efforts to eliminate pollution with the operating budgets of local governments has already unleashed a wave of fines \u2013 one of McDonald\u2019s French fries suppliers received a record 3.9m yuan ($629,000) fine for water pollution in Shanghai last month \u2013 which may deter current or would-be polluters.  The new law also gives activists more power to tackle pollution: for the first time, Chinese NGOs have the right to sue polluters. It\u2019s the latest development in the \u201cwar on pollution\u201d announced by premier Li Keqiang last year.

Photograph: Andy Wong/AP    Still, lack of follow-through on environmental policies remains one of the biggest obstacles to progress. Take China\u2019s green lending laws, for example. Since 1995, China\u2019s central bank has required financial institutions to place a priority on protecting the environment when choosing which projects to fund. However, a 2012 report from the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection found that only 12% of banks had taken this requirement to heart, and 18% showed no tangible evidence that they had adopted the policy.

As the world\u2019s largest country by population, the world\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer, China has long faced global scrutiny for its social and environmental practices. Chinese manufacturers, in particular, face pressure from Chinese citizens, activists and business leaders, as well as from Western companies trying to improve their supply chains. Perhaps the most influential citizen-led group is the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPEA), founded in 2006 by journalist-turned-environmental advocate Ma Jun. The group\u2019s purpose is to shine a light on pollution in China. By making official pollution data easily available to the public, Ma has made it possible for people to take action in their communities, and has made it nearly impossible for polluters to hide. Among the IPEA\u2019s work is the China Pollution Map, a database that allows users to search for pollution violations by company name, and the Green Choice Alliance, an NGO network that lobbies multinational companies to help reduce pollution from their Chinese suppliers. In recognition of this work, Ma won a 2012 Goldman Prize, as well as a 2015 Skoll Foundation Award for Social Entrepreneurship.  One notable business-led environmental group is the Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology (SEE), which has become the most prominent funder of environmental groups and projects in the country. SEE was founded in 2004 by some of China\u2019s notable entrepreneurs, including Liu Xiaoguang, the head of the state-owned financial services and real estate firm Beijing Capital Group, and Wang Shi, founder and CEO of Vanke, the world\u2019s largest real estate developer, in response to the rapid desertification of the Tengger Desert in northern China. Financed in part by contributions from each of the 87 founding members, many of them influential Chinese entrepreneurs, SEE has helped to fund a number of autonomous groups across China, including Ma\u2019s IPEA.

Photograph: Qilai Shen     Related: Russia: the unsustainable superpower    The labor and human rights issues China faces are so well-known they have become a clich\u00e9: long hours, hazardous working conditions, low wages and limited \u2013 or nonexistent \u2013 worker protections. But just as it took years for the plight of Chinese laborers to become widely known in the West, the reforms taking place are also speeding ahead of public perception.  Years of work from labor rights advocates including China Labor Watch, the China Collective Bargaining Forum, and the China Labour Bulletin, among many others, have resulted in a workforce that has grown more empowered to demand fair pay and better conditions.  There are innumerable ways in which China casts a shadow, influencing its neighbors andthe entire world. Many of the most obvious ways are negative: water woes, pollution drift, dirty energy. But China has begun what appears to be an about-face on key global environmental issues, and with its size and influence, it also has an opportunity to be a role model for the world \u2013 and to spur major changes with its market power. If China grows a domestic market for green products, for instance, suppliers around the world will certainly rush to help fill it.  Last fall, China made a groundbreaking commitment to reach peak emissions no later than 2030, and Beijing has pledged to end its use of coal by 2020. And China has gone much further than simply serving as the manufacturing heart of the global solar boom: the country has for the past three years been setting a blistering pace for new solar installations. In the first quarter of 2015, China installed solar capacity equal to France\u2019s entire output, which in addition to dramatically lowering emissions helps to further build economies of scale in solar manufacturing and expand solar\u2019s reach.  Despite the many benefits of China\u2019s green transition, a potential downside waits in the wings: as Chinese workers successfully improve their livelihoods, one of the most challenging reverberations may be the spread of cheap labor practices to other developing countries.    Related: The BRIC nations' response to climate change is critical to the fate of the planet    Cheap labor and lax regulations may fade away in China, but there are plenty of markets that can help with companies still engaged in the global race to the bottom. In other words, the same forces that brought jobs to China may well send them away. Among the markets emerging for cheap manufacturing labor are Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and even Myanmar. As low-cost manufacturing shifts away from China, will labor and environmental advocates lose all the progress made in China over the last 15 years and have to begin anew in each of these countries? Or can these new host countries learn lessons from China\u2019s evolution and chart a better course to sustainable development?", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "China", "Climate change", "World news", "Pollution", "Environment", "Business", "Ethical business", "Corporate social responsibility", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-04T16:57:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/06/orson-welles-100-bfi-tribute-hollywood-legend-film", "sentences": ["The film will be shown as part of a season that includes other classics such as The Magnificent Ambersons and The Lady From Shanghai.", "The Lady from Shanghai: an Orson Welles film with a backstory as bizarre as its promotional picture."], "title": "Orson Welles at 100: BFI pays tribute to Hollywood legend", "article": "He revolutionised theatre, radio, cinema and television, and made what many regard as the greatest film of all time.

The season\u2019s co-curator, Geoff Andrew, said they would show as much of his film and television as they could, including the only recently discovered Too Much Johnson, an unfinished, unedited silent comedy film he shot aged 23 and intended for use in a live stage play.     Welles on location for Too Much Johnson, a film made in 1938 believed to have been destroyed in a 1970 fire. It was later discovered in an Italian warehouse.

Destiny was written at that moment.\u201d Three years later, Welles made Citizen Kane. The film will be shown as part of a season that includes other classics such as The Magnificent Ambersons and The Lady From Shanghai.  A 1998 re-edit of Touch of Evil, the last last feature film Welles made in Hollywood, will get a UK-wide theatrical release as part of the BFI celebration. Also planned are illustrated lectures giving an insight into the extent of his innovation, and his work across many mediums.  Callow, who will publish the third and final instalment of his Welles biography next year, said he was a man \u201cwho wanted to do everything\u201d. One \u201cbreathtaking\u201d discovery was that Welles was seriously being groomed to be the first secretary general of the UN.

In another story, the actor explained how, after Welles\u2019s King Lear failed catastrophically in New York, he travelled to Vegas and spent a week as a conjuror. \u201cHe went from King Lear to Vegas \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of madness that was going on with Welles all the time, which is fascinating and wonderful.\u201d The season will also examine his TV work, including showing episodes from a mini-series called Around the World with Orson Welles in which he toured Europe, going to a bullfight in Madrid and to the locations of The Third Man in Vienna.

In fact it was a medium he was fascinated by and had revolutionary ideas about.\u201d The season will also include screenings of less familiar films including The Trial (1962), The Immortal Story (1968) and F for Fake (1976); and examples of his huge passion for Shakespeare with the films Macbeth (1948), Othello (1952) and Chimes at Midnight (1966) in which he is Falstaff.

The Chinese government in January banned drivers of private cars from offering such services through apps. Police last week raided Uber offices in the southern city of Guangzhou, seizing thousands of iPhones and other equipment used to run the business.

A nostalgia which has embraced 70s bohemia and 90s minimalism is making way for an intergalactic aesthetic, with Louis Vuitton the latest fashion power player to turn his catwalk into a spaceship. A hit combination of Louis Vuitton\u2019s Parisian glamour and the brutalist flying saucer desert chic of the late Bob Hope\u2019s Palm Springs estate threatened to break Instagram on Wednesday as designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re staged his new cruise-season collection in the John Lautner-designed house built for the comedian in 1973 \u2013 and on the market for $25m (\u00a316m).  Fifty looks, from sandy Star Wars-esque flowing robes to Xena the Warrior Princess-style hotpants, took a sunset parade around the swimming pool, where giant Perspex speaker towers and towering palm trees were dotted among guests seated with views over the Coachella valley.     The Palm Springs estate designed for Bob Hope by John Lautner.  Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty    The house, a monumental 23,000 sq ft, features a giant oculus at its centre, which draws the eye skywards from the UFO-style concrete curves to the vast expanse of Californian blue above \u2013 and hints at the worlds beyond that. It is an epic, Hollywood-sized version of the smaller silver domes next to the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, which Ghesqui\u00e8re commissioned for his previous show two months ago. Futuristic architecture is the standout trend in fashion this spring, with catwalk shows staged in ahead-of-their-time landmarks. Last week, Chanel staged a bubblegum-toned, K-Pop influenced show in Seoul, at Zaha Hadid\u2019s curvilinear Dongdaemun Design Plaza. On Monday, Christian Dior will show in the Palais Bulles near Cannes, a retro-futuristic cluster of bubble-shaped rooms balanced on a seaside waterfall, the one-time summer mansion of designer Pierre Cardin.     Palais Bulles by architect Antti Lovag, Pierre Cardin\u2019s residence Photograph: Alamy    Such self-declared affinity with space-age architecture is a bold statement of intent and ambition from fashion brands which for decades have proudly upheld the whitewashed, high-windowed salons of the Avenue Montaigne as the ultimate expression of elegance. The move is a vivid visual representation of a leap into the unknown for names which are rooted in the past but have far-reaching ambitions for the digital age. This space-age synergy between catwalk shows being staged thousands of miles apart is all the more striking since it unites luxury brands which are fierce rivals for the same consumers. But this reflects the way in which, as the global fashion industry has expanded and fashion weeks have become more accessible, the most powerful names in luxury have broken free to create an unofficial Champions League level of elite catwalk events.      Location, location ... could the space-age trend be coming to a high street near you? Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty    This is an arena in which only the wealthiest names compete, in which expensive stunts \u2013 hiring the world\u2019s most expensive houses, luring supermodels out of retirement \u2013 are par for the course. Chanel, Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Burberry now each stage lavish, celebrity-filled catwalk extravaganzas, as well as taking part in the regular round of fashion weeks.  Burberry visited Shanghai last year, on the launch of a flagship store, and recently staged a lavish show in Los Angeles aimed at elevating its name in the spiritual home of the red carpet.  The expense of such events sets the luxury giants apart from the individual designers who take part in the London, New York, Paris and Milan catwalk rosters. Louis Vuitton flew VIP guests including Catherine Deneuve \u2013 whose cult 1983 vampire movie with David Bowie, The Hunger, was cited by Ghesqui\u00e8re as an influence \u2013 to Palm Springs, and are reported to have paidfor 3,000 luxury hotel room nights in the resort, in addition to the production costs of the show. The vogue for strikingly photogenic venues also reflects the rising power of Instagram, which demands a 360-degree experience which attendees \u2013 some of whom are invited because of their social media reach \u2013 can then showcase. But the new vogue for the space-age also reflects the profound impact Ghesqui\u00e8re is having on the luxury world two years after his appointment at Louis Vuitton. The avant-garde, futuristic aesthetic which Ghesqui\u00e8re championed in his previous role at Balenciaga is being given a wider platform at the bigger brand, where the look reaches a global audience far beyond the Paris fashion week faithful. For the jet-set customer, for whom the charms of Aspen and Positano have perhaps faded with ennui, the space-age represents the excitement of a newly aspirational frontier.", "tags": ["Louis Vuitton", "Fashion", "Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re", "Life and style", "Architecture", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-07T13:59:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/08/a-league-semi-final-sydney-fc-v-adelaide-preview", "sentences": ["His loan spell from Shanghai SIPG expires at the end of the season amid reported interest in the striker from the Newcastle Jets."], "title": "Sydney FC v Adelaide United - what to look out for | Rob Brooks", "article": "Home ground disadvantage Having finished second behind Melbourne Victory, the Sky Blues will have the comnfort of\u00a0playing in Sydney when they face Adelaide in Saturday\u2019s second A-League semi-final. But,\u00a0how much help is it for a team which only picked up a sorry\u00a016 points at Allianz Stadium during the regular season?\u00a0 Indeed, this campaign was Sydney\u2019s worst at home in six years, and their opponents this week defeated them twice at this venue this term alone. What is it that has prevented this genuinely talented team, coached by one of the best in the business in Graham Arnold, from picking up maximum points on their own turf? Do they not take enough initiative in attack? Does the pitch somehow not suit Arnold\u2019s highly structured style of football? Were their best players simply not available enough of the time? Regardless, Arnold will have his side primed for this must-win clash. If there have been issues which have stopped Sydney from being at their best on game day, they will have been addressed over the past fortnight of preparation. This is the same forward-thinking coach, after all, who halted his Central Coast Mariners players from celebrating too much after going 2-0 up over Brisbane Roar in the 2011 Grand Final. And we all know how that finished. Returning Stars To Shine Sydney FC have certainly suffered more than their share of serious injuries over the course of the campaign. Nicky Carle, Ali Abbas and Corey Gameiro headline a host of players who sat on the sidelines for extended periods over the past eight months. So the return of a couple of stars could not have come at a better time for Arnold\u2019s men. Terry Antonis has been confirmed as a definite member of the matchday squad after missing the last two months with a knee injury. And, perhaps more importantly, Austria skipper Marc Janko will lead the line once again following his return from a shoulder complaint which kept him out of the final round of the regular season. Antonis is not expected to start, but his availability alone will have given the Sky Blues a boost in the lead-up to this knockout clash. Janko, on the other hand, will surely be there come opening whistle. Adelaide, meanwhile, are also likely to welcome the return of Bruce Djite from a groin strain, while Michael Marrone is back from suspension. This will give the Reds a spark up front, which was missing at times in their narrow win over Brisbane at Adelaide Oval last week. So, with both teams getting close to full strength, it\u2019s set to be a memorable showdown.   Related: A-League semi-final: Melbourne Victory v Melbourne City \u2013 what to look out for | Jack Kerr    The Odd Couple Could there be a greater contrast between two coaches on the sidelines than we see in Arnold and Josep Gombau? It\u2019s hard to imagine. Perhaps a Craig Foster versus\u00a0Ange Postecoglou match-up would take the cake, but this is still pretty good. While Gombau has subdued himself a little from his Jose Mourinho-esque bursts down the pitch from last season, there still lies within the Spaniard a passion barely bubbling beneath the surface. This is the sort of unbridled joy for the game that was won Gombau many fans in Australia. Arnold, on the other hand, will almost certainly spend the majority of the game slumped deep in his chair, occasionally standing or barking an order at whichever player dared to shift out of formation. Perhaps a snide comment to Zeljko Kalac or Andrew Clark sitting to his left will follow. Be that as it may, it\u2019s almost impossible not to respect the man and his tactics. More than the sideline behaviour, though, this game is set to be a battle of syles, with Sydney to play in the typical organised manner of all Arnold\u2019s sides, while Adelaide will look to utilise the pace of Sergio Cirio and Craig Goodwin down the flanks. As this tussle plays out, the game could well be won between the lines, with Alex Brosque for the Sky Blues and Marcelo Carrusca for the Reds to provide a moment of brilliance while stretching the opposition defence out of shape. Keeping Them Honest The last time these two sides met, goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic was unbeatable. Like a shot-stopper from an early 90\u2019s video game, the 33-year-old latched onto the ball no matter which corner of the goal it was heading for. There were 17 shots taken by Sydney that night, and none could get past the inspired Galekovic. Whether or not the Socceroos back-up is able to replicate that invincible form is unknown, but where he will certainly have the edge on his opposite number is with his feet. Arguably the best goalkeeper in the A-League in terms of distribution\u00a0\u2013\u00a0certainly since Mat Ryan departed the Mariners - Galekovic will be planning on starting a few of Adelaide\u2019s attacks from within his own box. Expect to see some high sweeping and pinpoint passes from the custodian in this semi-final. With Sydney to press high through Janko and Brosque, Adelaide will be relying on it. Motivation and Moves Meanwhile,\u00a0Janko has been offered a new deal worth a reported $1.4 million, which has chewed up many column inches over the past few months, and\u00a0Bernie Ibini\u2019s future is also\u00a0in doubt. His loan spell from Shanghai SIPG expires at the end of the season amid reported interest in the striker from the Newcastle Jets. Shane Smeltz has also been tabled a new two-year deal to stay Sydneyside, but is yet to commit. In contrast, Adelaide have secured Isias, Carrusca and Cirio beyond this season, while Pablo Sanchez and Miguel Palanca are expected to stay. Nigel Boogaard has already confirmed his exit to his hometown of Newcastle. Could it be that the more settled Reds will upset Sydney FC again, or will the added motivation of potentially playing for the shirt one last time spur on the Sky Blues\u2019\u00a0stars?

Carrie\u2019s War paints a poignant and realistic picture of what the second world war was like for a child. The second world war was traumatic and frightening for children, and those being evacuated had to be very brave. Carrie\u2019s War captures the true reality of war for a child, and it doesn\u2019t sentimentalise war.          Katherine Rundell, author of RooftoppersA book that made a huge impression on me was Number the Stars by Lois Lowry (the author of the sublime book, The Giver). It\u2019s about two best friends, one Jewish, during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, and it\u2019s extraordinary; honest and wise without being sentimental or exploitative. There\u2019s a scene in it, with a sniffer dog and a boat filled with refugees, that still haunts me.          Michael Morpurgo, author of books including War Horse, Friend of Foe, The Amazing Story of Adolphus TipsI would choose Goodnight Mr. Tom and/or Carrie\u2019s War, both hugely relevant stories today, when we consider those refugee children worldwide fleeing from the devastation of war. It\u2019s a subject I have written about often myself. SF Said, author of Varjak Paw and PhoenixI\u2019d like to recommend two books on the second world war. The first is The Diary Of Anne Frank: for me, still the most powerful book about the war. Anne Frank\u2019s voice was incredible: so honest and direct. I just wish she\u2019d lived to write all the other books she wanted to write.  The other book I\u2019d recommend is less well-known, but equally worth searching out: Robert Westall\u2019s Blitzcat, a fantastically evocative novel about the Blitz. It\u2019s told from the point of view of a cat who passes through many human lives, achieving something like what Michael Morpurgo\u2019s War Horse did with the first world war. Philip Reeve, author of Mortal Engines series and Cakes in SpaceMy favourite second world war set book is Empire of the Sun by JG Ballard, a child\u2019s-eye view of war which is both startlingly unsentimental and weirdly dreamlike, it\u2019s not written for children but teenagers would enjoy it. I also want to recommend Pied Piper by Neville Shute, which was actually written during the war and is about an elderly Englishman who becomes responsible for a growing group of children as he tries to escape from the German invasion of France in 1940. I read it as a child, and it left a deep impression. Tony Bradman, author of My Brother\u2019s KeeperI want to recommend three: Last Train from Kummersdorf by Leslie Wilson \u2013 this is a terrific story about Hanno and Effi, a boy and a girl trying too survive in the chaos of Germany at the end of the war. Johnnie\u2019s Blitz by Bernard Ashley \u2013 a gritty, hard-edged novel about Johnnie Stubbs, a boy who finds himself on the run and looking after a three-year-old girl in the blitz. The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall \u2013 still one of the best books for children about the second world war. Geordie lad Chas McGill adds the ultimate trophy to his collection of war souvenirs \u2013 a working machine gun from a crashed German bomber\u2026 James Dawson, author of Under My Skin, current Queen of TeenMy favourite second world war story is a beautiful picture book called Rose Blanche by Ian McEwan (illustrated by Roberto Innocenti). After soldiers come to her German town, young Rose follows a strange truck through the forest, unprepared for the horrors she witnesses behind a barded wire fence. Originally published in 1985, the book clearly influenced both Schindler\u2019s List and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, and the haunting illustrations stayed with me long after I finished the book.   Related: Anne Frank: 10 beautiful quotes from The Diary of a Young Girl    Louise O\u2019Neill, author of Only Ever YoursI was fascinated by the second world war as a child and begged my mother to buy me as many books as she could on the subject. Some of these have stayed with me ever since. Anne Frank\u2019s Diary, Carrie\u2019s War by Nina Bawden, Goodnight Mr. Tom, and Back Home by Michelle Magorian, and of course, the wonderful When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit by Judith Kerr. But the book I remember having the greatest impact on me was Summer of my German Soldier by Bette Greene. I read it when I was about 10 and it was the first time I gave any consideration to the fact that not all of the Germans fighting in the war were inhumane monsters. The eponymous German soldier, Anton, has no interest in Nazi ideology; he is simply a young man caught up in something beyond his control. It\u2019s a powerful book about love and desperation. Twilight Vi, site memberThe book that I love most on the second world war is Carrie\u2019s War by Nina Bawden. It made me think about what it\u2019s like to be evacuated and I just love this book. I really want Jacqueline Wilson to write a book about an evacuee, I think it would be brilliant.          Sita Brahmachari, author of Artichoke Hearts and Red LeavesMy choices are The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. This book and the young heroine Liesel Meminger\u2019s story is one of personal friendship and courage with \u201cthe enemy\u201d against all odds. When Liesel steals a book from her wealthy employer her world begins to expand. Despite the fact that these books are read in the basement of her house while bombs fall all around her. The book speaks of the power of literature to open people\u2019s hearts to each other. She and her foster father cannot stand by and see the young Jewish man who is her friend be taken by the Nazis and when he is at his lowest ebb it is Liesel reading from her stolen books that keeps hope in his heart. This book will make you cry, restore your faith in human nature and think about the power of stories to transform lives.           I also want to recommend a book for younger children: The Lion and The Unicorn by Shirley Hughes, a beautiful picture book story of a boy who holds on to the badge he is given by his father as he goes off to fight in the war. Through all Lenny\u2019s trials \u2013 having to be evacuated, fear for his father\u2019s safety, missing his mother and meeting a wounded soldier \u2013 it this badge of the Lion and the Unicorn that keeps him believing in hope. It seems to have an almost magical power. Shirley Hughes\u2019s illustrations bring home the loneliness and confusion that war brings to children\u2019s lives. Paul Dowswell, author of The Story of the Second World War and Ausl\u00e4nderThese are written for adults, but great for teens: The World at War by Richard Holmes, the book accompanying the unbeatable 1970s TV documentary series. These eye-witness accounts just pip Studs Turkel\u2019s similar The Good War at the post, with first hand testimony by everyone from Lord Mountbatten to Hitler\u2019s secretary Traudl Junge, and the poor chaps on the ground who had to do the actual fighting.          Site member ItWasLovelyReadingYouMy second world war book recommendation is Code Name Verity by Elizabeth Wein.  I cannot stress how much I love this book, and if I described why I liked it i\u2019d probably just echo my review so yeah, Code Name Verity!          Sarah McIntyre, author and illustrator whose books include Oliver and the SeawigsMy favourite second world war book growing up was called Marta and the Nazis by Frances Cavanah. It follows the escape from Austria of a Jewish girl who\u2019s secretly carrying the family diamonds in her baby doll\u2019s bottle. But I think it\u2019s out of print\u2026 So I\u2019m going to choose another couple of YA books too: Maus by Art Spiegelman. Spiegelman\u2019s groundbreaking use of comics to tell the story of a man interviewing his father about the Holocaust feels even more universal because he chooses to draw its human characters as different kinds of animals. Empire of the Sun by JG Ballard: a young Brit named Jamie scavenges an existence alone in wartime Shanghai and in Japanese prison camps, coming to identify with his captors, admiring their fighter pilots and losing any sense of taking sides in the international conflict.    Related: Judith Kerr:  I wasn\u2019t scared enough. That\u2019s how I nearly gave us away    Jessamy Taylor, author of King\u2019s CompanyRecommending something to read about the second world war is particularly difficult because the good books (The Diary of Anne Frank, Goodnight Mr Tom, The Boy in Striped Pyjamas, The Silver Sword, and many, many more) are also very important. My own best-loved one is When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, Judith Kerr\u2019s story of her family leaving Berlin in 1933 and living as refugees in Switzerland, Paris and finally England. It\u2019s warm and compassionate and very funny. When I read it to my daughters, one of them laughed until she fell off the bed at Max and his French homework. Then we cried over Onkel Julius, because the fear, and the terrible implications of Hitler winning the election, are all there too, calmly and clearly explained. It\u2019s a wonderful book and I\u2019ll not just recommend it, I\u2019ll plead for it to be read. Leslie Wilson, author of My Last Train from KummersdorfGood Night Mr Tom by Michelle Magorian is a deeply touching story that confounds expectations of \u201cthe war story\u201d. Linda Newbery\u2019s Sisterland displays a profound understanding of the complexities of human experience, as well as being an engrossing read with a highly sympathetic main character.           Shalini Boland, author of the Outside dystopia series as well as A Shirtful of Frogs, a second world war timeslip adventure I want to recommend Goodnight Mr Tom by Michelle Magorian is a beautiful tale of the makeshift families that were created when children were evacuated from the cities. At first it seems as though nine-year-old Londoner Willie Beech is sent from one terrible, abusive situation to another; but Mr Tom isn\u2019t as gruff as his exterior\u2026 I also adored The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by John Boyne. It\u2019s a shocking, heart-wrenching tale, but absolutely gripping. A true modern classic that will make you think long after you turn the last page.     Asa Butterfield in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Photograph: c.Miramax/Everett / Rex Features    Laxmi Hariharan, author of The Many Lives of Ruby IyerI\u2019m going to recommend The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje\u2019s novel for adults which is perfect for older teens. I saw the film before I read the book. Not one but two doomed love affairs set towards the end of the second world war. I loved the vast richness of his canvas from an Italian monastery to the deserts of North Africa, the weaving of the politics of war with the power play of passion, all exhilarated with the thirst for exploration and adventure. I also love Under the Blood Red Sun by Graham Salisbury \u2013 I love this coming of age story set in Hawaii in 1941 when the Japanese launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbour. It shows how devastating an effect a war can have on children. In this case it changes Tomi\u2019s life from being an all American baseball loving teen, to becoming an enemy in the eyes of his neighbours and finally to rediscovering his pride in his Japanese heritage. So, ultimately it helped him find his identity and place in society.  Site member, Infinity scolopendra I like the Michael Morpurgo books on the second world war.          Piers Torday, author of the Last Wild trilogyI have a few to recommend! First of all Hero on a Bicycle by Shirley Hughes. Shirley Hughes is one of my literary heroes but her story is about a very different kind of hero. Britain was never invaded during the war, but this tense adventure gives a thrilling taste of the dilemmas which might have faced young people if we had been. Girl With a White Dog by Anne Booth. This story is not set during the second world war, but without giving the clever plot away, it is about a young girl confronting her family\u2019s past role in the conflict and discovering that while the 1940s feel far away now, many prejudices which inflamed the hostilities then remain all too current.          Otto by Tomi Ungerer. A beautifully illustrated classic tale about a teddy bear separated from his Jewish owner at the start of the war \u2013 will they ever find each other again? Says so much with great simplicity and power. And lastly, The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall. As a young boy growing up in the North East, I remember being hooked by this Carnegie award-winning yarn about five children from the region who find a working machine gun in a crashed Luftwaffe plane and set about defending their home town from bombing raids with dramatic results. It made me realise that war sweeps everyone up in its path, whatever their age.          Damian Kelleher, author of A Dog in No-man\u2019s LandI\u2019d choose Robert Westall\u2019s The Machine Gunners. It\u2019s the second world war seen through the eyes of Chas, a teenage boy on Tyneside, and Westall brings the whole business of war down to a very personal level. He also creates an incredibly exciting adventure with Chas and his gang finding a German machine gun and the lengths they go to conceal it. I can also recommend Michael Foreman\u2019s War Boy, his beautifully illustrated second world war memoir of his childhood in Suffolk. It includes the true story of the bomb that comes crashing through the roof, bounces round his bedroom before landing in the grate and exploding up the chimney.   Related: Top 10 animal war heroes    Sarwat Chadda, author of the Ash Mistry seriesMy choice is William Carries On by Richmal Crompton, was published right in the heart of the second world war. We see all its little absurdities played out in the life and times of William Brown, always aged 11. The book is a collection of seven stories, ranging from how William discovers that lemon soap (guest size) does not make for a good lemon substitute in cooking, to how the village suffers from a \u201cBomb Inferiority Complex\u201d, to how William (sort of) captures Hitler in the old barn, to finally witnessing his attempts to accelerate the peace process by having Violet Elizabeth run over by a train. Or at least lie between the tracks.  Bernard Ashley, author of Dead End Kids and Johnnie\u2019s BlitzMy favourite, in order, are: The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank, The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall, I Am David by Anne Holm, Carrie\u2019s War by Nina Bawden, The Silver Sword by Ian Serraillier. I also want to quote what 14-year-old Yitskhok Rudashevski wrote in his diary during his imprisonment in the Vilna Ghetto:   Today the ghetto celebrated the circulation of the one hundred thousandth book in the ghetto library. The festival was held in the auditorium of the theatre. \u2026 Hundreds of people read in the ghetto. The reading of books in the ghetto is the greatest pleasure for me. The book unites us with the future, the book unites us with the world.   He was killed in 1944.          Rachel McIntyre, author of Me and Mr JI love Back Home by Michelle Magorian. The moving experiences of an evacuee returning from America to drab, post-war England. Rusty\u2019s bewilderment and confusion is so vivid in this heartfelt book. And I\u2019d also like to recommend Code Name Verity by Elizabeth Wein. Every detail of every scene is woven into a story so fast-paced, it had me literally holding my breath as I turned the pages. An authentic and gripping read rooted in female friendship and heroism. Ayesha, site memberMy favourite second world war book would most definitely have to be The Book Thief by Marcus Zusak. This is because it is told in the perspective of Death and not in an English or French or German or Russian perspective, showing that no one is being dishonest. It is about an innocent young girl who discovers a love for reading and who doesn\u2019t understand exactly why there is a Jew hiding in the basement. I love the innocence that is portrayed in this book as well as the brutality of Death\u2019s narration. It is an addictive read and I highly highly recommend it to anyone. Thedauntlessbookthief, site memberMy all time favourite book (that just so happens to be set during the second world war) is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.          Lottie Longshanks, site memberI would recommend anything written by Michael Morpurgo about the war, especially Friend or Foe. I also enjoyed The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall and Storm Warning by Mara Kay. My two absolute favourites are Fireweed by Jill Paton Walsh and The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico.          ButterflyLion, site memberI really like Adolphus Tips by Michael Morpurgo. PetrovaFossil, site memberMy favourite second world war book is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak; I loved the way the characters spoke to me as if they were real. I felt part of the story and the fact that is was narrated by Death just made it all the more believable! I love Liesel\u2019s and Rudi\u2019s relationship and was in tears when the bomb hit the street. It is one of the best books that I have ever read and one of the very few that has made me emotional. The Book Bunch, site membersWe loved When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, Judith Kerr.

My faves when I was young #VEDay70&mdash; Danielle Woodward (@daniellewoody14) May 8, 2015    David, on email This choice or recommendation may seem a little obscure, or obtuse, but I\u2019d offer The Book of Merlyn by T H White. Though not published until 1977, it was written in 1941 and deals, not directly but through analogy, with the causes of the war and its consequences in the militarisation of human life. The character of Mordred from the traditional Arthurian cycle is updated to be head of a political movement, called The Thrashers, with obviously fascistic overtones (though they may also echo the Oprichniki of Ivan IV, known as Ivan the Terrible \u2013 a kind of medieval SS in some versions of events). White, though a tortured soul in some respects, had a depth of compassion for humanity that\u2019s evident in this anti-fascist allegory, a work that remains neglected because it wasn\u2019t included with the original Once and Future King collection.    @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit by Judith Kerr. I re-read it just recently :)&mdash; Jenni Fuchs (@jennifuchs) May 8, 2015    Annie, on email My favourite book about the second world war is Peggy Larkin\u2019s War by Trevor Forest.

A beautiful and engaging friendship. My daughter LOVES this book.    @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks Fireweed by Jill Paton Walsh. Its impact still stays with me, decades on. #VEDay70&mdash; Laleh Hobbs (@Laleh_online) May 8, 2015    Verity (aged 14), on email I nominate Biggles Defies the Swastika by W.E. Johns. It\u2019s a classic adventure story set during the invasion of Norway in the second world war. I think this part of the war is perhaps a little less well known, and also the author is more obscure now. Johns was a pilot and so the information about second world war aeroplanes is very interesting and detailed. This story also has a confrontation between Biggles and his arch enemy, Erich von Stalhien, a German Intelligence officer. It makes for an entertaining and informative read, as Biggles and his associates attempt to evade capture in order to escape to London with important military information.     @GdnChildrensBks No doubt it would be the Nevil Shute novel Pied Piper  1942&mdash; Meadowlark (@4norsemen) May 8, 2015      @GdnChildrensBks Little known,much loved as a child: The Last Flower,James Thurber.Could be any war but written &#39;39 after invasion of Poland&mdash; Fruin O&#39;Dill (@FruinODill) May 8, 2015      @EmilyDrabs @GdnChildrensBks Ian Serrellier&#39;s The Silver Sword&mdash; Ruth Kennedy (@ruthkennedy) May 8, 2015      @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks The Book Thief and Boy in The Striped Pyjamas&mdash; Pramodha Weerasekera (@wpramodha) May 8, 2015      @GdnChildrensBks @jabberworks Sandi Toksvig&#39;s Hitler&#39;s Canary, about a Danish theatre family under Nazis - excellent #WW2KidsBooks&mdash; Irish Writers&#39; Union (@WritersUnion_ie) May 8, 2015      @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks Morris Gleitzman&#39;s 4bk series beginning +Once-read 2many yr6 classes &amp; thy wld even miss lunch to hear more&mdash; Lisa Donnelly (@LisaDonnelly12) May 8, 2015      @GdnChildrensBks We love Pennies for Hitler by @Ozlaureate - WW2 seen through the eyes of a young German boy Georg pic.twitter.com/UfnRtGVN5a&mdash; Harper360 (@Harper360UK) May 8, 2015      @GdnChildrensBks WW2 Henderson&#39;s Boys, Robert Muchamore&#39;s exciting series, Art Spiegelman&#39;s heartbreaking Maus, my favourite graphic novel.&mdash; Harry Oulton (@HarryOulton1) May 8, 2015      @GdnChildrensBks Susan Cooper&#39;s Dawn of Fear- growing up WW2style, air raids etc, not old enough to be frightened -but having to learn.&mdash; Lara (@still_readingme) May 9, 2015      @GdnChildrensBks Morris Gleitzman&#39;s &#39;Once&#39; and &#39;Then&#39;: http://t.co/08C8HI4CjK pic.twitter.com/m8JoSCa1Py&mdash; Tessa Wooldridge (@OzKidsYALit) May 8, 2015  ", "tags": ["Children and teenagers", "Books", "Culture", "Second world war", "Children's books: 7 and under", "Children's books: 8-12 years", "Teen books", "Shirley Hughes", "SF Said", "Piers Torday", "Juno Dawson", "War (children and teens)", "Historical fiction (children and teens)", "Michael Morpurgo", "Ian McEwan", "Picture books", "Judith Kerr", "Art Spiegelman", "JG Ballard", "John Boyne", "Non-fiction (children and teens)", "Michael Ondaatje", "VE day"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-08T07:22:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/ghost-cities-of-china-wade-shepard-review-planning", "sentences": ["Milton Friedman, Shepard notes, saw Pudong, Shanghai\u2019s Central Business District, in its early form as a ghost city, or rather a \u201cstatist monument to a dead pharaoh\u201d.", "It is hard to imagine this ever happening to some of the examples in this book, which serves as a fascinating bestiary of apparently whimsical urban planning fixes \u2013 the British, Dutch and German-themed suburbs that surround Shanghai, for example, are populated mostly by visitors taking wedding photographs."], "title": "Ghost Cities of China by Wade Shepard review \u2013 unpopulated replica towns explained", "article": "One of the many under\u2011populated cities visited in this book is Hallstatt, on the outskirts of Huizhou, in Guangdong province. It is a precise copy of Hallstatt in Upper Austria. \u201cThe resemblance to the real Hallstatt went down to the smallest detail \u2026 the sounds of birds tweeting were playing throughout the streets from hidden speakers \u2026 and The Sound of Music soundtrack played on an endless loop could be heard everywhere.\u201d Wade Shepard was inspired to visit such places after his first, more mundane, sighting of a ghost city. He went to Tianti, in Zhejiang province, by accident getting off a bus at the wrong stop, and found a series of empty high-rises and office blocks so quiet he could hear only the wind and his own breathing. The buildings \u201call appeared to be crisp and new, inside they were dark cavities, devoid of inhabitants and interior fit-out\u201d. Many western observers, on coming across these places, have described them as surreal, or like stage sets \u2013 Shepard cites various reports, from Al\u2011Jazeera to internet \u201c10 Crazy Things About China\u201d webpages. They often conclude that China\u2019s property boom is fake, made up in large part of Potemkin cities set up as property boondoggles. As this book makes clear, that is not quite the case. Shepard has written an account of the economic rationale behind the more apparently strange and freakish aspects of the country\u2019s urbanisation; a crash course in how Chinese capitalism, if that\u2019s what it is, actually works. The first thing to understand is that nobody in China actually owns property. Land is still nationalised, and leases are sold for up to as many as 70 years. That China lacks property, however, doesn\u2019t signify a shortage of property developers. In fact, the \u201cproperty\u201d market described here sounds as extreme, if not more so, than that of London, with extortionate rents, a paucity of social housing (a pitiful 3% of all construction) and, most of all, the use of apartments and houses as investments \u2013 it is normal for middleclass Chinese to borrow their way into owning several unoccupied flats, even if they don\u2019t have one to live in. A version of this practice is now familiar in the UK; who influenced who is an open question. The second important point is that a \u201ccity\u201d in China is not simply an urban built-up area. Rather, it is a legal designation referring to everything that the municipality controls. So a \u201ccity\u201d such as Chongqing encompasses 28 million people, of whom only around 4.5 million actually live in the recognisable city itself. Urbanisation is much more lucrative than conserving agricultural land, so the municipalities \u2013 perpetually starved of central government funds, as in the UK or US \u2013 are eager to build. Reversing Mao, the result is that \u201cthe city surrounds the country\u201d. Premier Li Keqiang has stated his intention to \u201cavoid the typical urban malady where skyscrapers coexist with shanty towns\u201d, but something like this is occurring, as the encircled villages become home to the migrant workers whose labour underpins all this feverish construction. Meanwhile, the rural evictions that turn a \u201ccity\u201d into an actual city are often bitterly resisted. One insurgent village was given the almost unprecedented right to freely elect its own council, which quickly realised it would have to flog land to fund its policies \u2013 a cruel initiation into the problems of reformist local government. Although there is widespread corruption, the profits are usually spent on \u201curban necessities, like social services, education, health care and welfare\u201d. Infrastructure spending is also colossal, particularly on a vast network of metro systems and high-speed trains, in an attempt to wean the newly created middle class from their cars in order to alleviate the drastic pollution. Yet cars, like houses, give their owner (or investor) \u201cface\u201d. Once built, the newly urbanised area often stays depopulated for a few years, as it is more expensive for investors to properly fit out and let their flats, so they sit on them until \u2013 as inevitably happens \u2013 the Communist party induces businesses to move to the area, usually by opening a new branch of a university and extending a metro out to each \u201cghost city\u201d; benefits, such as free transport, low rents or even a couple of years rent-free are offered and are usually effective. So few places remain ghost cities for long. And if they exemplify a problem, it is rising inequality, rather than a precarious economy. The property bubble is unlikely to burst, as local authorities are merely one (municipal) branch of the Communist party owing money to another (banking) branch, which has no interest in making its comrades bankrupt. Milton Friedman, Shepard notes, saw Pudong, Shanghai\u2019s Central Business District, in its early form as a ghost city, or rather a \u201cstatist monument to a dead pharaoh\u201d. It is now one of the most bustling, populated places on Earth. It is hard to imagine this ever happening to some of the examples in this book, which serves as a fascinating bestiary of apparently whimsical urban planning fixes \u2013 the British, Dutch and German-themed suburbs that surround Shanghai, for example, are populated mostly by visitors taking wedding photographs. Their desolation is part of the appeal for their affluent residents \u2013 in the \u201cDutch\u201d district Shepard finds that \u201cthese people like their ghost town the way it is\u201d. Other examples include Huaxi, the first of rural China\u2019s communes to be listed on the stock market, and a village which has built itself a skyscraper taller than the Shard (it is a strictly hierarchical society, where the original communards enjoy new cars, villas and free health care, while most of the villagers are migrant workers with barely any rights). Some of the worst policies are now being phased out, such as investors sitting on unfitted-out flats. The government intends to increase social housing to 25% of construction, but this seems more a response to fear of unrest than worry that the bubble might burst. So far, in fact, its policies have succeeded in creating a capitalist class while leaving the Communist party in control. It is a wasteful approach, for sure, but very its primary functions are the generation of profit and the urbanisation of a recently rural country. Given the government has the power to make and remake cities, why are the results so sad? Copycat \u201cwestern\u201d towns, endless Central Business Districts, huge malls; this is urbanisation purely for quantity and profit. Other writers have argued that certain municipalities, such as Chongqing, have managed a more egalitarian state\u2011driven urbanisation than others, like Guangzhou, but Shepard doesn\u2019t explore the question. Neither does he address the future: once the ghost cities are populated, what next? \u2022 Owen Hatherley\u2019s Landscapes of Communism (Allen Lane) will be published in June.

A year earlier her boyfriend had taught her the basics of poi, a Maori dance in which performers swing flaming, tethered weights to describe bright geometric shapes in the dark. Despite the burns and bruises she earned, Dmytriievska was a determined pupil. She would practice for hours each day, drawing flowers and other outlines around her body using dummy weights, before attempting the same perilous tricks using fire. Although money was never the primary motivation \u2013 \u201cI simply love the fire; there is something magical when you feel like it\u2019s in your control,\u201d she said \u2013 after a few years Dmytriievska turned semi-professional. She joined a circus troupe in her home city of Kiev, Ukraine to help support her university studies. She excelled, often performing to audiences of hundreds. In June 2007, the troupe began rehearsals for an interpretation of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s poem, The Raven. As the backing music sounded out for the first time \u2013 a pipe organ, played rhythmically, as if calling people to worship, soon joined by galloping guitars and a furious drumbeat \u2013 Dmytriievska took to the stage. She began to dance. But her mind was not on the performance. As soon as she finished the routine she left the stage, walked up to her friend on the mixing desk and asked: \u201cWhere is that music from?\u201d   Related: Eve Online: how a virtual world went to the edge of apocalypse and back. By Simon Parkin    The track, he said, came from Eve Online, a science-fiction video game. It is, he explained, a game set in a vast galaxy comprised of tens of thousands of stars and planets, and inhabited by half a million or so people from around the world, who explore and do battle together daily via the internet. Dmytriievska returned home to see for herself. Space, it turned out, was a demanding place. Even before she entered the virtual galaxy, Dmytriievska had to make numerous choices. What would her character look like? What race would they be? Would they have shoulder\u2011length hair or a tight bob? What about piercings, tattoos or scars? Today, after years of updates and improvements, people who are new to Eve, as the game is known to its inhabitants, meet their digital avatar in the captain\u2019s quarters of a spaceship, a gloomy room with a full-length mirror in which you can admire your newborn character. But when Dmytriievska joined, Eve was a simpler proposition. \u201cBack then it was more of a, \u2018Here is your ship, now fuck off\u2019 kind of approach,\u201d she told me. Dmytriievska\u2019s new character was summarily cast out into space, in a Rookie ship \u2013 the lowliest and least powerful craft in the game, offered gratis to every newcomer. On screen, at the centre of the sweeping galaxy, Dmytriievska saw her craft, a nub of lights and metal, blinking expectantly in a perpetual night sky. Moments later, its hull erupted in flames, as an enemy ship taught her Eve\u2019s most elemental rule: in space, everyone longs to hear you scream. Dmytriievska, who only spoke a little English at the time, tried in vain to find other Ukrainian or Russian players within the game who might be able to guide her through the basics. Eve is a cold, hostile environment. You can pause to admire the curious play of light in the atmosphere, or the heft of the distant planets as they pass through stardust clouds, but sooner or later you will have to start thinking about how you are going to go about earning a living, out there in the galactic wilderness. That new spaceship will not pay for itself. Dmytriievska\u2019s initial expedition floundered in the face of Eve\u2019s arcana \u2013 should she install the Social Adaptation Chip in her character\u2019s digital brain to increase her charisma or the Ocular Filter, to increase her perception? Glumly, she closed the game window. But Dmytriievska did so not to quit, but to learn. Just as she had spent a few hours each day learning to juggle fire, she now took a few hours each day to study Eve. Along with fish, aluminium and Bj\u00f6rk, Eve Online is one of Iceland\u2019s biggest exports. Launched in 2003, it is a science-fiction project of unprecedented scale and ambition. It presents a cosmos of 7,500 interconnected star systems, known as New Eden, which can be travelled in spaceships built and flown by any individual. In-game professions vary. There are miners, traders, pirates, journalists and educators. You are free to work alone or in loose-knit corporations and alliances, the largest of which are comprised of tens of thousands of members. As a microcosm of human activity, the game has been studied by academics interested in creating political models, and by economists interested in testing financial ones. In a universe where every bullet, trade, offer of friendship and betrayal can be tracked and its impact logged and measured, Eve offers a new way to understand our species and the social systems of our world. \u201cWithin Eve we can see a political community that models hierarchy, authority, rule of law, power, violence and distribution of labour,\u201d says Felix Ciuta, senior lecturer in international politics at UCL. \u201cPlayers project onto this blank space their political and ideological principles. The way in which people act in the game might not reflect the way in which they act in the real world. But their virtual behaviour almost certainly is an expression of their ideas about how the world really works.\u201d    As a microcosm of human activity, the game has been studied by economists interested in testing financial models    As she began her research, Dmytriievska read about the game\u2019s three primary districts. High Security is a heavily policed area of space where drones and sentry guns pursue characters who have been flagged for criminal activity. Here new recruits can find sanctuary from the pirates that roam Low Security, a more dangerous patch of cosmos where unscrupulous bandits hijack vessels to sell them on for profit. The third, final and most notorious territory is Null Space, the galactic wild west where even the most well-tooled characters live in a state of constant peril. There the risks of being blown up are offset by the potential rewards: money, fame and power. Dmytriievska researched the famous and infamous factions and corporations that vie for control of territory. She read about their renowned leaders, who battle and scheme for supremacy. She learned of Eve University, a player-run virtual institution staffed by volunteers who lead newcomers through the fundamentals, and of the legendary Titans, vessels so large that they are capable of disrupting the tides of entire planets. Finally, in 2008 after months of study, reading online guides and lurking in the game\u2019s forums, Dmytriievska felt ready to return to New Eden. With some sense of ceremony she clicked on the icon Eve Online for the first time in nearly a year. She has lived there most days ever since. * * * In 1997, three friends \u2013 Reynir Har\u00f0arson, Thorolfur Beck and \u00cdvar Kristj\u00e1nsson \u2013 founded the game studio Crowd Control Productions (CCP) in Reykjavik. Their ambition was simple but ludicrous: to \u201ccreate virtual worlds more meaningful than real life\u201d. They dreamed of a game that would appeal to people from all over the world: a multiplayer space opera. This kind of luxurious project (the \u201cCrowd Control\u201d in the company name bespoke the hope that its games would be well-populated) was not going to be cheap. For one thing, at the time, there was no broadband internet connection in Iceland. So, first, the trio launched a board game, H\u00e6ttuspil (Danger Game). They had so little startup money that they had to mortgage a house owned by a close friend\u2019s grandmother to pay for its printing. The gamble worked: H\u00e6ttuspil was a hit (since its debut, roughly one in eight Icelandic households bought a copy). With the money from the board game, the team were able to work towards Eve\u2019s big bang moment. After three years of continuous work, the game finally launched in 2003. In the two decades after video games first appeared, outside of a few university campuses, people could only play cooperatively while gathered around the same screen or plugged in to the same local computer network. The advent of the internet brought new possibilities: virtual spaces that could be inhabited by more than one person at a time, who could connect from anywhere in the world. But these virtual worlds soon faced a problem: they were forever on the edge of obsolescence. Players were often lured from one game to the next, each brave new world more technically proficient than the last. When too many players leave a virtual world, the cost of maintaining it becomes prohibitive and the game\u2019s servers are switched off. This is a catastrophic event: the world and everything in it dies.     Spaceships do battle in Eve, a virtual world that has achieved the rare feat of lasting more than a decade. Photograph: Eve Online    Since the first graphical virtual worlds launched in the mid-1990s, more than 50 have closed as a result of dwindling populations. Some, such as Lego Universe (2010-2012) closed quietly and without ceremony. Others make the Armageddon a formal part of the fiction. When Rubies of Eventide (2003-2009) closed down, developers burned down the capital city and every player\u2019s character died in the fire. Some developers provide remaining players an opportunity to celebrate their memories and even to grieve. In the hours before Star Wars Galaxies (2003-2011) closed, the skies lit up with a prolonged and expansive firework display, providing a mournful ceremony for the remainder of the million players who bought a copy of the game during its eight-year existence. Eve is one of the few virtual worlds to have survived longer than a decade. Still, apocalypse-by-exodus remains a constant worry for CCP\u2019s 330 staff, most of whom work exclusively on Eve, from one of the company\u2019s four offices in Reykjavik, Atlanta, Shanghai and Newcastle. Andie Nordgren, the game\u2019s executive producer, believes that it has not only survived but thrived because it is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest living work of science-fiction\u201d. Eve\u2019s narrative appeal has little to do with formal authorship. It is constantly evolving, but not in the same way as other so-called massively multiplayer online games, such as World of Warcraft, where new stories are added by a collective of scriptwriters. Eve\u2019s story is written and steered by the actions of its players, whose individual and collective dramas play out and intersect week by week. People do not play Eve to \u201cwin\u201d. There is no way of \u201ccompleting\u201d the game and no set, overarching goal. Once you\u2019re a virtual millionaire and own the most powerful ship in the game, Eve becomes a game about social interaction and self-made goals. This gives the game its distinctive power. One story, above all, illustrates this power. At 5am on 18 April 2005, a character known as Mirial, the CEO of Ubiqua Seraph, one of the largest corporations in the game, warped into the Haras solar system, flanked by her most trusted lieutenant. It was a moment for which the members of the Guiding Hand Social Club, a corporation of spies founded by Istvaan Shogaatsu, had long been waiting. A code word went out across the Shogaatsu\u2019s chat channels: \u201cNicole\u201d. Within an hour Mirial was dead. Ten months earlier, Shogaatsu had agreed to take on this contract killing for an anonymous client. The fee was one billion ISK \u2013 Eve\u2019s virtual currency, named after the Icelandic kr\u00f3na. It was, at the time, equivalent to about \u00a3320. (While it is illegal to sell ISK for cash, CCP sells an in-game currency for real money, so it is possible to calculate an exchange rate.) Throughout the intervening period, Shogaatsu and his agents performed a thorough infiltration operation, orchestrated in private chat channels and on secretive forums. They took on jobs within Ubiqua Seraph and, week by week, ingratiated themselves with other corporation members. Soon the mercenaries had operatives in every level of the organisation. When the code word went out, the spy network was poised to strike. Mirial\u2019s prize ship was destroyed, along with her escape pod and, finally, her vacuum-frozen body was delivered to the Guiding Hand Social Club\u2019s client. Shogaatsu\u2019s spies looted the company\u2019s hangars and vaults. The combined cost of the ambush and theft totalled more than 30bn ISK, an estimated \u00a310,600 of assets lost through robbery or destruction. It was, at the time, the largest theft of virtual assets in any video game. While the ensuing news reports brought Eve to the attention of players around the world, some feared it might destroy the universe too. \u201cIt was a pivotal moment,\u201d said Hilmar P\u00e9tursson, who worked at CCP from the beginning, and who took over as the company\u2019s CEO in 2004, shortly before the incident. \u201cPeople wanted CCP to interfere. They felt betrayed and outraged. But we looked at what had happened and could see no rules that had been broken. Only trust had been broken. It\u2019s not our job to guarantee trust.\u201d When CCP released a statement to this effect there was an outcry from both players and staff calling for the decision to be reversed. For many, a line between play and reality had been crossed. Overnight, 500 people cancelled their subscriptions to the game. For a few days, New Eden teetered on the brink of destruction. * * * Eve skirted apocalypse. Many players exited the game in disgust but, soon afterwards, a British video game magazine published a story about the incident. Five thousand intrigued readers joined. If Eve\u2019s world had been on the verge of collapse, it was now saved and, moreover, its custodians had established critical laws with which to govern the virtual world. It was a close call, but a crucial one. As long as no real-world laws were broken, players now knew that they were free to play the game however they chose; an act of extraordinary cunning or betrayal might even make them famous.     The 2015 Eve Fanfest held in Reykjavik. Photograph: Steingrimur Arnason    Perhaps this is why Eve inspires in some an undying allegiance. Almost every year since 2004 Eve players from across the world have gathered in Iceland\u2019s capital. Together they drink, celebrate and share knowledge or get-rich-quick schemes (sample session title from 2015\u2019s event: \u201cConfessions of an Eve Trillionaire\u201d). In the Harpa building \u2013 a mass of black glass that sits heavily on the Reykjavik shoreline, like a grounded spaceship \u2013 attendees whoop and cheer as CCP announces its forthcoming plans for the virtual galaxy. In 2015, the crowd were brought close to mass hysteria by the news that the paintwork on ships will soon be shown to gather dirt and rust. One hundred and twenty players showed up for the first \u201cfanfest\u201d. This year there were 1,200, many of whom had spent thousands of dollars to be there. The makers of other popular video games hold annual festivals in their honour, but this event is different, not least because Eve\u2019s players are different. This is not a game that accommodates undergraduate stoner idling or StarCraft\u2019s caffeine-fuelled competitiveness. Its victories come slowly. They require long-view investment, even leadership skills. CCP claims that more than 50% of the player base is employed in engineering. \u201cYou will never find a player who has done something important in Eve Online who has not also done something important or significant in the real world,\u201d one attendee at the fanfest told me. At this year\u2019s event, two artists had set up shop in one of the Harpa building\u2019s broad corridors, offering a range of Eve-themed tattoos. Next to their stall, attendees in fancy dress browsed a shop selling miniature models of in-game spacecraft. There were also burned-out circuit boards, taken from the game\u2019s servers to be replaced with quicker versions. Before the morning\u2019s masterclasses ended, I approached an older man dressed in heavy priestly robes, edged with gold trim and ornate clasps. Charles White is a Californian with a closely trimmed beard, thin-rimmed glasses and a soft accent. He also works for Nasa\u2019s jet propulsion laboratory; he helped put the Rover on Mars. \u201cIn the game the players call me the Pope of New Eden, harbinger of faiths,\u201d he told me. \u201cI ran with that and made a costume based on the player\u2019s feedback. I showed up here wearing the costume because I\u2019m 55 years old and I don\u2019t give a crap any more.\u201d     An Eve player gets a tattoo at the annual fanfest. Photograph: Ben Hunter    White has been playing Eve since 2008 and is anxious about Eve\u2019s future development. \u201cI don\u2019t really have an endgame,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m concerned for some of the elder players. Once you own a Titan you\u2019ve pretty much won the game. Where\u2019s the challenge? There have to be things to do.\u201d Players running out of things to do is just one of the threats facing the Eve universe. It must continue to expand in order to hold its inhabitants\u2019 attention, but this expansion must also be in the right direction. One wrong move can jeopardise the game\u2019s existence. In 2011 CCP introduced a new feature that had been 18 months in the making: a digital store where in-game items (clothing, accessories and so on) could be purchased for real money. It was a disaster that brought New Eden close to its second catastrophic event. At the fanfest, Francesco Munda, an Italian player, recalled what happened: \u201cAt that time the game had a huge number of technical problems. Then in this grand reveal, CCP gave us a digital shop. All other problems were pushed aside. The game was in dire need of fixing. Nothing was fixed.\u201d For many players, one object on sale in the digital shop epitomised CCP\u2019s greed: a virtual monocle that could be worn by a player\u2019s online character, which cost \u00a345. The leak of an internal memo from the company\u2019s CEO, Hilmar P\u00e9tursson, that denounced the complaints as \u201cnoise\u201d further enraged the player base. Thousands gathered within the game and began to stage symbolic riots, firing their ships\u2019 weapons on a giant monument stationed outside a major trading hub. The protest, which marked the beginning of what soon became known as the \u201cSummer of Rage\u201d, was staged continuously for a week. It was effective. In an unprecedented move, P\u00e9tursson wrote an open letter to the game\u2019s players admitting that he had made a mistake. \u201cWe made a mess and someone had to own it,\u201d he explained to me. \u201cIt was mine to own.\u201d After the letter of apology, CCP acknowledged the protest by switching the 3D model of the in-game monument to one that was broken and damaged, a lasting memorial to the time when the players made their collective voice heard and the game\u2019s makers responded. Few video games accommodate their player base in this way. Eve\u2019s creators have learned that the future of their world depends not only on the happiness of the game\u2019s players, but also their feeling that the players, ultimately, own the world which they inhabit. P\u00e9tursson describes his company as mere caretakers. A better analogy is that he and his employees are gods. While many CCP staff members play the game avidly, they also exist in Eve on a celestial stratum, defining the rules and boundaries of its reality, listening to the desires of the players and deciding whether or not to act upon their pleas. And among this group of heavenly bodies, fire-juggler Nataliia Dmytriievska is something of an archangel. * * * After she rejoined Eve, Dmytriievska began to help other new players into the game, remembering the difficulties that she had experienced. She joined a large alliance, which had around 10,000 members, and began to recruit newcomers. Twice a week she would host teaching sessions \u2013 either general theory or practical flying lessons through the less dangerous areas of space. In playing the game, Dmytriievska made friends with some CCP staff. \u201cI talked to them about what it was like to work there,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey told me it\u2019s like a family. I wanted that.\u201d Dmytriievska sent numerous job application forms to CCP, each of which was rejected. But she had learned the value of persistence and, finally, after four years of pursuing her career inside the game, was invited for an interview to become a game master, an official expert employed to answer players\u2019 questions. Dmytriievska\u2019s family urged her not to go to Iceland. One family member told her that Ukrainian women who emigrate often end up as sex slaves. But Dmytriievska, who had just gained her bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal psychology, was determined to find a way to turn her hobby into a vocation. Ignoring her family\u2019s warnings, Dmytriievska arrived in Reykjavik on 12 March, 2013. She stepped off the plane into darkness. The sky was overcast, untouched by stars or the northern lights. It was, she recalled, extremely cold. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep all night,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so excited to see the country and to meet CCP.\u201d The interview, contrary to Dmytriievska\u2019s expectations, was not focused on her professional background or character, but on her knowledge of and accomplishments within Eve itself. Dmytriievska was being primed for a special role. Unknown to her, she was to become a cosmic go-between. Four years earlier, CCP had commissioned a study into the political state of New Eden, hoping to understand how they could better manage this vast virtual society. The study\u2019s authors argued that the game needed a player-run political body. Eve\u2019s society had evolved past tribal structures, they said, into complex social hierarchies. In response, CCP established the Council of Stellar Management (CSM), an invention unique to Eve, the only example of a game-based democratic organisation designed to represent a virtual society. Each year scores of candidates stand for election in one of the 14 places on the council. In 2015 there were 75 candidates, drawn from across different areas of space. Just as in real life, candidates come with platforms, create propaganda and muster both in the game and out for votes. Twice a year, CCP flies the successful candidates to their headquarters in Reykjavik for a few days of intensive debate \u2013 an audience with the gods, if you will. During that time, the council meets with CCP\u2019s staff and hears about the new features planned for the galaxy\u2019s future. The meetings can be heated and, on more contentious issues, there can be in-fighting between council members. But the council performs a crucial role in bridging the gap between the game\u2019s makers and players. Indeed, after the 2011 riots, CCP called an emergency summit in Iceland for the council. P\u00e9tursson admits that the CSM\u2019s advice directly influenced his mea culpa. Dmytriievska\u2019s final interview was, in the end, a mere formality. She was asked to start work later that week as CCP\u2019s official coordinator for the council, a chaperone and champion for council members. Hers is a crucial role in the project to keep Eve\u2019s universe alive. She must manage the tension between the game\u2019s creators, who want to execute their vision, and the game\u2019s inhabitants, who have different priorities. It is as if gods and their people are in a war over the universe \u2013 and Dmytriievska is caught in the middle. As well as the risk of alienating players by tweaking the way the game works, CCP also faces the challenge of policing behaviour when aggravation and bullying spills out of the game and into the real world. In 2014, a statue was unveiled just outside CCP\u2019s Reykjavik office. The monument lists the names of all active main characters in the game as of 1 March 2014 \u2013 more than half a million of them. It was a proud moment for the developers: the statue was unveiled by J\u00f3n Gnarr, the charismatic, cross-dressing comedian who served as the city\u2019s mayor from 2010 to 2014. A few days later, four of the game\u2019s players scratched off a rival character\u2019s name from the memorial. The police were called and, when the culprits were found out, they were evicted from the game with a lifetime ban. At other times, players have been known to hold others to ransom in the game for real money. One Russian player once claimed to be a hacker and threatened to cut the power to a rival\u2019s home during play in order to steal his Titan ship, which takes weeks to build and is worth between \u00a32,000-\u00a32,500. At last year\u2019s festival the Friday night pub-crawl ended in a street brawl (although there were some minor injuries, the participants later claimed it was just a bit of fun). \u201cI\u2019ve heard about couples breaking up over backstabbing in Eve,\u201d says Nordgren, the game\u2019s executive producer.     A Titan spaceship. Some are so large that they can affect the tides of Eve\u2019s planets. Photograph: Eve Online    For many players who have been involved in Eve for years, the social game around the digital game is what provides the ongoing attraction. Merely improving one\u2019s spaceship soon becomes tiresome. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s a game about spaceships \u2026 but not so much,\u201d a senior member of one of the game\u2019s larger, player-forged corporations said. \u201cIt\u2019s about people.\u201d * * * The most famous of Eve\u2019s players is Alexander Gianturco, alias the Mittani. He is leader of the Goonswarm Federation, the largest alliance in Eve, and his name is known in every corner of the virtual galaxy. (Gianturco\u2019s Twitter profile picture shows him kneeling, kissing the hand of Nasa\u2019s Charles White.) He commands close to 40,000 players, directing the federation\u2019s battles and actions from his home in Madison, Wisconsin. Gianturco, who used to work as a corporate lawyer in Washington DC, makes his living from the game by running an Eve-specific media empire, reporting the news of events from within the game on his website and YouTube channels. Gianturco regularly boasts that he has not logged into Eve for three years. Instead, he runs the Goons from chatrooms and online forums. According to Andrew Groen, an American freelance journalist who is writing a history that charts the first decade of Eve Online, Gianturco has helped to bring about a shift in the game\u2019s tone. \u201cEarly in Eve\u2019s story the game was a role-playing society; it was a blank canvas so the person who could make the largest splash became the most noticeable and therefore the most powerful.\u201d Players tended to be very sincere and to treat this fictional world with utmost seriousness. Today, Groen says, people are more aloof. This tonal change is, in part, thanks to the maturing world. \u201cIn the old days it was cool to care,\u201d says Groen. \u201cBut Goonswarm came up with this fascinating cultural edict: if you take the game seriously and you bond under the idea that you\u2019re the best of the best, a single loss can unravel the social fabric of the group. So Goonswarm\u2019s rallying cry is: we are terrible at this game. This means that when they lose they are able to laugh about it. But when they win they laugh even harder, making fun of the defeated and bonding over the hubris and misery of their enemy.\u201d CCP claims that Eve is more popular than it has ever been \u2013 in 2013 the game\u2019s population passed 500,000. The company\u2019s experiment in democracy, following the Summer of Rage, has paid off. The search for new players also continues. Last month, the company simplified no fewer than 73 tutorials into seven more straightforward introductory topics, with a hope to entice newcomers who had previously been put off by Eve\u2019s complexities. But the game faces other challenges, not least from rival space-simulation games. This is, after all, a game built on ageing technology. In a medium where technological prowess is often key to dominance in the market, that is a risk. Is the game\u2019s future truly secure? \u201cEve is certainly built upon compromises we had to make 15 years ago when first designing the tech,\u201d P\u00e9tursson said. \u201cNevertheless this 12-year-old game is in many ways the most innovative one out there.\u201d Arguably there are no other online worlds that exhibit such mature and nuanced social structures, or that allow players to play the game from outside its digital boundaries, as Gianturco does. \u201cThere are aspects of Eve that nobody has been able to replicate,\u201d said P\u00e9tursson. Many of Eve\u2019s inhabitants agree. During one of the final panel sessions at this year\u2019s fanfest, one councillor spoke earnestly of his belief in the game\u2019s future, despite the toughening competition. \u201cEve offers an experience you can\u2019t get anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we\u2019re up here. It\u2019s not because you can fly around shooting other people. We\u2019re here because you get to deal with people, both their in-game lives and their out-of-game lives.\u201d     Nataliia Dmytriievska and Paul Elsy. Photograph: Daniel Hoffend    Groen is equally confident about the game\u2019s prospects. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it\u2019s not around for another decade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will probably be around for another 25 years. CCP honestly believes in the philosophical idea of a virtual construct that never dies.\u201d There is something undeniably Icelandic \u2013 stoic, intrepid \u2013 in all this. As the snow swirls irritably around the Harpa building, it is easy to make a link between the game\u2019s environment and the country in which it was conceived. For some, Eve\u2019s philosophical darkness \u2013 its inhabitants are lost in space, engaged in never-ending conflict \u2013 reflects something of the dread of Iceland\u2019s inescapable winter. There\u2019s beauty in its vastness and ambition, but it can also feel bleak and oppressive. \u201cThat\u2019s the key,\u201d says Groen. \u201cEve offers us this utopian idea that you can never die. You can resurrect endlessly. But it also poses the question: do we really want to be strapped into the machines, waging war until the end of all time?\u201d For Dmytriievska, the answer is clear. In Eve, she has found the support and family she was looking for. \u201cWe all help one another,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can rely on people. I never felt that in the Ukraine.\u201d She is now engaged to marry Eve\u2019s community manager, Paul Elsy, whom she met in the game. But her attachment to Eve is not merely romantic. \u201cI never felt as though I was in the right place until I came to this volcanic glacier in the middle of the Atlantic,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut here, I am an essential cogwheel at the centre of this incredible mechanism that is capable of creating universes. It feels interesting. It feels important. I can help to keep the fire of this world burning forever.\u201d Back in the Ukraine, Dmytriievska\u2019s relations remain sceptical about her choices. \u201cA few times I\u2019ve been told to take a careful look at what I am doing with my life and maybe start thinking about a serious job,\u201d she said, looking at the floor. After a moment, she looked up again, defiantly. \u201cI simply reply: there can be nothing more serious than the spaceships business.\u201d  Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread  \u2022 This article was amended to correct the following errors: the Council of Stellar Management meets twice a year, rather than every six months, and the meetings can last up to five days.

Sprawling across 110 hectares on the outskirts of Milan, this crazed collage of undulating tents, tilting green walls and parametrically-contorted lumps can mean only one thing: Expo 2015, latest in a long and controversial tradition of \u201cworld\u2019s fairs\u201d, has landed. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to build a stage where all the actors can make their voices heard,\u201d says its design director Matteo Gatto, fresh from touring the Italian prime minister and the pope (who has his own, relatively restrained, pavilion) around the frenzied fairground. And Gatto appears to have achieved his aim: the 140 participating countries and brand sponsors are screaming their presence at full volume. In the centre of Milan, however, others have been making their voices heard in a different way. As the fair opened on May Day, thousands took to the streets to protest, while violent splinter groups smashed shopfronts and torched cars. \u201cThe Expo is a machine for burning public money,\u201d said one protester, carrying a \u201cNo Expo\u201d banner. \u201cIt promised to bring jobs and boost the economy, but it\u2019s being run by voluntary labour and has wasted billions on pointless infrastructure.\u201d    Expo claims to be a celebration of slow food and healthy eating but is sponsored by giants like Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s  Activist        The United States pavilion: Expo 2015\u2019s official motto is \u2018Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life\u2019.

The whole thing is beyond a joke.\u201d Expo 2015 has been one of the most controversial world\u2019s fairs ever staged in Europe. It has been plagued by escalating budgets, seeing total expenditure balloon to around \u20ac13bn, including the costs of building new transport infrastructure to service the site, 10 miles from the centre of town. It has suffered interminable construction delays, meaning \u20ac1m has had to be spent on building camouflage structures to hide the unfinished pavilions for the opening. And, while being touted as a model of a cleaner, post-Berlusconi Italy, it has been damned by charges of corruption and bribery, seeing seven senior managers and former members of parliament arrested last year, and more indicted for bid rigging a few months later. So what does the city have to show for its seven-year struggle? Traipsing the kilometre-long gauntlet of novelty structures, past Daniel Libeskind\u2019s twisted totem poles for Siemens and Norman Foster\u2019s \u20ac60m rippling pink concrete walls for the United Arab Emirates, it\u2019s hard not to see the whole endeavour as a monumentally misplaced allocation of resources. The exhibition content is, in the main, as vapid as the architecture is extravagant. Visitors roam like herds of lobotomised oxen in search of nourishment, from clambering on a net over some flowerbeds inside Brazil\u2019s giant climbing frame, to the touch-screen excitement of playing \u201cLithuania or not?\u201d (a game of swiping national dishes into a digital shopping basket). Most countries\u2019 exhibitions feel like a cross between a Waitrose advert and a travel agents\u2019 trade fair \u2013 immersive multimedia dioramas of bountiful produce and spectacular scenery, dotted with stalls selling craft trinkets and samples of cheese.     Israel\u2019s pavilion in Milan features tilting green \u2018fields of tomorrow\u2019. Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Shutterstock    \u201cWe thought we had a chance to do something radically different,\u201d says Stefano Boeri, the Milanese architect and planner originally responsible for coordinating the Expo masterplan when the city won the bid in 2008, until he was removed in 2010. \u201cKnowing that previous Expos have been quite weak, and have failed to leave a serious legacy, we thought we could really do something that would benefit the city.\u201d Boeri assembled a crack team to develop the masterplan. Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron were joined by the London Olympics\u2019 chief adviser on architecture and urbanism, Ricky Burdett, American designer and \u201ccradle to cradle\u201d evangelist William McDonough, and Joan Busquets, the Spanish architect and planner responsible for much of the good that resulted from the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. It would have been hard to conjure a better legacy-minded think-tank on paper. \u201cWe really wanted to get away from the usual vanity fair of competing architectural \u2018innovations\u2019,\u201d says Jacques Herzog, speaking from his studio in Basel. \u201cI was honestly shocked when I visited the Shanghai Expo [in 2010]. You were blinded by the amount of design, so by the time you left the show you had forgotten everything about the exhibition. We wanted to focus on the content, and use the site as a laboratory for creating something useful for Milan, which wouldn\u2019t leave the usual wasteland of ruins.\u201d Their plan did away entirely with the conventional format of bombastic national pavilions, sweeping the countries under a field of tent-like canopies instead, arranged in long strips either side of a central axis. \u201cWe went back to the Roman foundation of Milan,\u201d says Boeri, \u201claying out big Cardo and Decumano axes with lateral side-streets, abolishing any kind of hierarchy, so there would be no difference in size between the rich and poor countries.\u201d    Expos entrance with the same sense of contemptuous captivation that comes from watching the Eurovision Song Contest       A model poses next to the Swiss pavilion on the opening day of Expo 2015. Photograph: Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty Images    Embodying the agricultural theme, half of each plot would be given over to a cultivated garden, where the countries would grow a food of their nation and then bring their produce to a kilometre-long table running down the central boulevard \u2013 \u201clike a global last supper\u201d, says Herzog. In reality, you can now admire photos of the fairtrade coffee cultures of East Timor and Rwanda, then go and have an Illy espresso at the sponsored coffee bar. Or you can learn about the cocoa industries of Cameroon and Gabon, then stuff your face with Ferrero products at the Nutella concept bar. As for the masterplan structure, it was planned to be \u201cshovel ready\u201d for development after the Expo, so as not to leave Milan lumbered with the usual white elephant. \u201cIt was a very simple plan to create something that leaves behind a physical armature for a city,\u201d says Burdett. \u201cSo when the tents came down, you would have the infrastructure there, with all the services already laid.\u201d As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that this light-touch plan was too radical for the international exposition movement and its attendant entourage of sponsors to adopt. Judging by the track-record of what other Expos have left in their wake, the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE) in Paris \u2013 the intergovernmental agency responsible for co-ordinating world\u2019s fairs since 1928 \u2013 appears even less aligned to the subtleties of city-making than the steamrolling bureaucracy of the International Olympic Committee. The BIE might talk in lofty platitudes about the \u201cintellectual legacies\u201d that are supposed to emerge in the form of grand declarations and charters, but in reality there seems precious little care taken to ensure the host city is left better off than it was found.     Nepal\u2019s pavilion: \u2018It is still fascinating to see national ambitions embodied in a line-up of skin-deep architectural flourishes.\u2019 Photograph: Stefano Porta/EPA    Despite brimming with positivity about the final result, Gatto is candid about the difficulties of developing the Expo masterplan. \u201cIt was not so easy to make the design advisors\u2019 ideas a reality,\u201d he says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t force the participating countries to do what we wanted \u2013 the rules of the BIE mean we have to give them freedom to design what they want. The structure of the routes and public space is still as we planned, but the sultans and sheikhs will always have their way and follow their own ideas. And that\u2019s really what makes the beauty of the Expo, this amazing variety.\u201d The architectural smorgasbord is certainly varied, as you stroll from Qatar\u2019s concrete fort, topped with a giant woven basket, past the mirrored labyrinth of Iran, to the bloated Italian pavilion, which appears to be modelled on a Chinese shopping mall. When you get to the one structure designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron at the end \u2013 a series of wooden barns for Carlo Petrini\u2019s Slow Food movement \u2013 you sense the whole thing might actually have been a bit insipid if left in the hands of their restrained Swiss good taste. Because, ultimately, surely the only point of visiting an Expo is to marvel, drop-jawed with morbid fascination, at the bizarre architectural freak-show, and be entranced by the same sense of contemptuous captivation that comes from watching the Eurovision Song Contest. It is a spectacular mess, but it\u2019s also fascinating to see national ambitions embodied, side by side, in a line-up of skin-deep architectural flourishes. But then you\u2019re rudely awaken out of your kitsch reverie by remembering quite what will be left, and at what cost it all came. Before the Expo arrived, this site was a place of overgrown, formerly agricultural land. The intention was to leave it in such a way that development could happen in a productive landscape, creating a new kind of high-density garden city once the tents were taken down. Such a bucolic idea was soon abandoned and, for ease of development, the entire site has been covered with an enormous concrete foundation slab \u2013 at a cost of \u20ac224m, mysteriously up \u20ac60m from the original tender price.     The elaborate 'canal city' idea didn\u2019t quite turn out as planned either       An early visualisation of Milan\u2019s Expo by Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron in 2009    The elaborate \u201ccanal city\u201d idea didn\u2019t quite turn out as planned either. The Expo was to be a catalyst for reviving Milan\u2019s network of waterways, opening up canals to irrigate surrounding farms. Work was begun, before it was realised that the water pressure would not be strong enough to reach the fields. The revised plan met with huge environmental opposition, so instead the network was to be buried underground. With \u20ac60m already spent on the project, the fabled \u201cVie d\u2019Acqua\u201d has yet to materialise. \u201cIt is the real scandal of the Expo,\u201d says Boeri. \u201cA ditch going to nowhere that will never be used.\u201d Nor does the future look much brighter. The Arexpo company \u2013 the joint-venture Expo legacy vehicle, co-owned by the City of Milan, the Region of Lombardy and, in smaller parts, the Fiera Foundation and City of Rho \u2013 is now in the unenviable position of trying to find a buyer for the site, a place severed on all sides by motorways and railway lines. Having first acquired the land at a vastly inflated price from private owners (for \u20ac160 per square metre, when agricultural land in the area is worth \u20ac8-12 per square metre), the public sector is also burdened with trying to make back some of the huge outlay on remediating the site and building the Expo\u2019s infrastructure. Recently, the site was offered up for sale at \u20ac315m \u2013 to deafening silence. What happens next is still up in the air, with vague plans ranging from building a new stadium, to a scientific campus for the State University of Milan and an innovation hub for tech startups. But don\u2019t worry, at least there\u2019ll be a charter.     The British pavilion is \u2018a metaphor for how the UK is a hive of innovation and creativity\u2019. Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Shutterstock    \u201cThere\u2019s simply been far too much speculation on the land and now they\u2019re stuck with it,\u201d says Emanuele Braga, co-founder of Macao, a politicised arts group that has been organising campaigns against the Expo since it was first announced. \u201cThe first mistake was buying land from private developers; the second was covering it all in concrete \u2013 when the theme is about feeding the planet and reviving urban agriculture. They should have used a site they already owned that was in need of regeneration.\u201d I meet Braga in a former slaughterhouse now squatted as the HQ of Macao, on the other side of town from the Expo. Working groups busy themselves discussing labour conditions and workers\u2019 rights, while a symposium led by Robin Hood Minor Asset Management takes place upstairs. (A few days later, Macao would stage an occupation of the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice, in protest against labour conditions in Saadiyat Island, where the Guggenheim is building its latest outpost.) Standing on the slaughterhouse rooftop, Braga points to a landscape of derelict meat- and fish-market buildings spreading out before us that he says would have made an ideal setting for an Expo themed around food. But such a site would have necessitated the intelligence of adaptive reuse and careful planning, of a kind clearly at odds with the tabula rasa predilections of the Expo juggernaut.    Few can point to Expos that have left a lasting legacy, other than the Victorian originator and its Crystal Palace       London\u2019s Crystal Palace was built to house the \u2018Great Exhibition of the Works of the Industry of all Nations\u2019 in 1851. Photograph: Science &amp; Society Picture Library/Getty Images    One hundred and sixty four years on from the first such extravaganza, London\u2019s Great Exhibition of 1851, it seems clearer than ever that the format of the world exposition is well past its expiry date, leaving a trail of debt and destruction wherever it strikes. When pushed, even Expo boosters can point to few events that left a positive, lasting legacy for their cities other than the Victorian originator \u2013 which brought us the Crystal Palace and left a great axis of cultural institutions lined up along Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the famed Albertopolis, which the Olympic park is now trying to mimic. Sure, Vancouver\u2019s 1986 Expo opened up its waterfront for development, and Montreal \u201967 left a nice park with a big Bucky dome and a small amount of experimental housing, but all these benefits could have been achieved without the vast expense of putting on a fair. For several billion dollars, cities could build vast quantities of real, affordable housing and acres of beautiful, truly public space. Seville\u2019s Expo 92 was one of the largest ever at the time, sprawling across 215 hectares dotted with geodesic domes and snaking monorails, at a cost of almost \u20ac10bn. Most of the structures were intended to be temporary, but the city had no money left to remove them following the event. They mostly still stand there, abandoned, as forlorn symbols of a future that never arrived, with the first European space rocket and a strange pyramid of national flags still looming above a post-apocalyptic landscape. The event left the city mired in debt for decades.    Shanghai\u2019s Expo was the biggest in history, spread across an area five times the size of Milan 2015, at a cost of $50bn       Fireworks mark the opening ceremony of the 2010 Expo in Shanghai. Photograph: Feng Li/Getty Images    Hannover 2000 suffered a similar fate. Buoyed by the light-headed optimism of the Millennium year, the bubble was soon pricked when only around half of the expected number of visitors turned up, once again leaving the region saddled with debt and a landscape of overgrown ruins. The site was laid out by Albert Speer Jr, son of Hitler\u2019s architect, who also planned the Beijing Olympics \u2013 a strangely prescient choice, given his father coined the idea of \u201cruin value\u201d in his grandiose Nazi works. Hot on the heels of the Beijing Olympics, Shanghai\u2019s 2010 Expo was the biggest in history, spread across an area five times the size of Milan\u2019s exposition at a cost of $50bn (\u00a332bn) \u2013 a level of ambition that saw 18,000 families forcibly displaced, according to Amnesty International. The Chinese pavilion has since been converted into an art museum, while most others have been demolished to make way for cranes, now busy building a new swathe of mixed-use city across the site. \u201cBetter City, Better Life\u201d was the theme \u2013 for those who can afford it.

Expo 2020 is the jewel in the crown of Dubai\u2019s national programme of steroidal grands projets but, given the troubled trajectory of fellow Gulf state Qatar\u2019s endeavours for the 2022 World Cup, the world is watching with trepidation. Still, in the fantasy playground of the United Arab Emirates, where impossible dreams are daily conjured from the desert at untold human and environmental costs, perhaps the world expo movement has finally found its spiritual home.

China digests latest food scandals    No type of food has been spared and the scandals have led to enormous mistrust among consumers. \u201cFood safety is definitely among the top concerns of Chinese people,\u201d says Wang Jing, a food and agriculture campaigner with Greenpeace China. \u201cIt\u2019s literally everywhere around people\u2019s lives.\u201d. In a survey last year, 80% of respondents said they were upset about the food safety situation in China. The poll of 3,166 people across 20 cities was conducted in the aftermath of a food scandal involving out-of-date meat supplied to top fast-food outlets.  Concerns relate to all stages of food production, from processing back to the growing of vegetables and breeding of livestock. One of the most shocking and high profile cases was in 2008, when melamine-tainted milk powder led to the deaths of six infants and hundreds more being admitted to hospital. While standards have improved and efforts have been made to reassure the public, the mistrust of Chinese-produced milk powder remains, leading to high demand for imported milk products.     The Taiwanese-owned Green and Safe shop sells fresh produce from the company\u2019s own farm a few hours from Shanghai, and bread from its own bakery. Photograph: Grainne Quinlan    Added to these scandals is China\u2019s alarmingly high level of pollution, a result of its rapid coal-driven economic growth. Thick swathes of grey smog regularly engulf many cities, while rivers and soil are poisoned by heavy metals from industry and mining. According to government figures, up to 40% of rivers and 20% of farmland is polluted.  Urbanisation has happened at a rate never seen before as people flock from the countryside to China\u2019s burgeoning cities. These new city dwellers increasingly find themselves disconnected from the source of their food, and with so many scandals it is often difficult for them to ensure their food is safe.   Related: Fast food companies facing fight to win trust of millennials    Emily Xu, a young mother who runs a children\u2019s reading and writing studio in Shanghai, says food safety is a big concern for her and many of her friends, particularly since their children were born. \u201cThe more you learn about [food safety scandals] the more upset you will be. Sometimes you just feel helpless because you can\u2019t change the air or you can\u2019t change the soil, you can\u2019t change the way farmers do the farming. And it seems the government can\u2019t do anything to help. More and more, I have friends who choose to emigrate.\u201d Many urban residents seek out alternative food sources. Organic food and imported products have risen in popularity and are considered a safer option than the traditional \u201cwet\u201d markets where fresh vegetables, meat and fish are sold. In cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, the number of specialist and boutique food shops selling organic food is growing, especially among the Chinese middle class and expatriate community who have disposable income and are willing to pay a premium for good-quality, safe food.     According to a survey conducted last year, 80% of respondents said they were upset about the food safety situation in China. Photograph: Grainne Quinlan    One such outlet is Green and Safe, a Taiwanese-owned shop in Shanghai\u2019s up-market former French Concession area. Much of the fresh produce comes from the company\u2019s own farm a few hours from Shanghai. The store also sells imported organic goods, meat and fish, bread from its own bakery and has a restaurant and cafe. Mrs Li is a regular customer and is carefully picking through the baskets of vegetables, looking for the best ones to make food for her son. \u201cThe vegetables here are in decent shape,\u201d she says approvingly. They cost considerably more than those sold at the local markets, but Mrs Li said she is prepared to pay extra. \u201cI know that this market has their own farm and the water they use is much cleaner than others\u2019.\u201d  Many city residents are buying directly from farmers they trust who grow vegetables without pesticides. Community-supported farms have become increasingly popular, says Wang, along with farmers\u2019 markets. A small group of consumers has also begun to grow food themselves, sometimes renting land on the outskirts of the cities. However, all of these options are relatively expensive and not open to most average-income families. Those who can\u2019t afford the premium price of organic or imported food \u201cbasically have not much choice\u201d, says Wang. She believes access to safe food should not be dependent on income. \u201cEveryone has the right to safe food, it\u2019s a joint responsibility of companies, the government and consumers ourselves to make this happen by altering chemical-intensive agriculture to a more ecological and sustainable way of growing food.\u201d The food hub is funded by the Irish Food Board.

Welland meant by implication to Hollywood, but, with rare fine exceptions, nothing sturdily continued to happen except Brits got to play all the cheeky villains. Now, however, with so much US creative talent migrating to clever television, that is the new Hollywood \u2013 and, goodness, don\u2019t the British now have their sensibly shod feet firmly under that table. Three shows aired this week that actually could not have been made without British input \u2013 all right, technically yes, but only if by \u201cbeing made\u201d we mean \u201cbeing made worse\u201d. Dominic West, as he might, holds The Affair together with a powerhouse performance; Toby Jones, fresh from Marvellous\u2019s Bafta triumph (during which he took a typically selfless podium stance behind the real Neil Baldwin) only put in creepingly fleeting appearances in Wayward Pines, but my money\u2019s on him holding the cat\u2019s cradle of plot strings. And, of course, Tamsin Greig and Stephen Mangan, making a welcomely dry return to Episodes; though it has to be said that this show still amounts to a fierce amount less than the sum of its parts. The Affair could so easily have been a humdrum\u2026 affair. Middle-aged writerly dad, fraught with in-laws and children interrupting his sex life, is about to have affair with small-town waitress with good legs. It is elevated to something quite different, something strangely good indeed, partly down to the careful quality of the writing (and performances) but chiefly to the inspired retelling of two sides of the same story. So we get to see Noah\u2019s (West\u2019s) memories of the start of the affair, and, half an hour later, those of waitress Alison (Ruth Wilson). They differ only in relatively subtle ways. Noah, say, recalls her as having been first to greet him, and with a grin, at the beach bonfire; and to be the first to suggest he take advantage of her walk-in shower. Alison recalls herself as having taken a slightly more heroic role in the choking-daughter diner scene; and, on the beach, Montauk on Long Island, is gazing mournfully out to sea (\u201cthe waves seemed even angrier than I was\u201d) and is convinced it was Noah who first hailed her. I am sure it was ever thus: even with recent events, our fickle memories work hard to put the best gloss on ourselves. Listen to two people\u2019s accounts of a minor car crash and you can begin to worry about history. It\u2019s all done with great style and skill, if an understandable frustration in hindsight on behalf of the third party, the viewer, to get at the objective truth. That will surely have to wait. Already, there are hints of dark consequences. To which branch of officialdom are they now separately recalling their memories, and why? Has something truly awful happened (pretty sure that\u2019s a yes)? It is also, without showing too much, oddly and gruffly dirty-sexy for the land of Paul Revere; think Jessica Lange on the table in The Postman Always Rings Twice.     Matt Dillon as Ethan Burke in Wayward Pines: \u2018exuberantly unsettling\u2019. Photograph: Fox    Way stranger and darker (even) than that, Wayward Pines clambered cloacally on to our screens last week. It is a cult looking for a following, and it\u2019s already got me on board as a beady-eyed acolyte. M Night Shyamalan is better known for big-screen success with The Sixth Sense and a later stream of un-hits in which he attempted to find that same shock-reveal moment which had us genuinely shivered back then, and roundly missed, as in (they often say this in the rarefied world of auteur meta-criticism) couldn\u2019t hit a cow\u2019s arse with a banjo. But he keeps on keeping on and, in fact, who better to exec-produce and direct this clammy, macabre slice of America\u2019s tripe-grey underbelly. If you think there\u2019s something of the deja vu about it, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve deja viewed it \u2013 Twin Peaks being the most obvious antecedent, but also, just about, The Truman Show, Fargo and, I\u2019m told, The Prisoner (though as a child I could watch neither that nor, interestingly, Babar because they made me think that\u2019s what being on drugs would be like). A secret service agent, Matt Dillon, whose face as ever looks like he\u2019s been twice round the world lashed to the wheelhouse of a dodgy Shanghai brothel boat, has his face look particularly so when he wakes up after a car crash in the exuberantly unsettling Wayward Pines. There\u2019s something instantly passive-aggressive about everyone he meets: the troubled and troubling sheriff (Terrence Howard) and nurse Pam (Melissa Leo, channelling Nurse Ratched) and of course the marvellous little tweedy Toby, a study in sinister. And the crickets only chirrup electronically, and there are way too many hidden cameras, and time-travel conundra to come, and something wicked that way went called the Easter bombings, and a huge electrified fence round the entire weird zip code, and a pretty barmaid. And of course we\u2019ve seen much of this before, but of course much of it was splendid. A warm welcome to Twin Pines.     Matt LeBlanc as himself in Episodes. Photograph: BBC/Hat Trick Productions/Showtime Networks/Patrick Wymore    Episodes has so much going for it. It\u2019s co-written by David Crane, the clever writer mainly responsible for Friends! It has Joey from Friends in the shape of Matt LeBlanc, playing himself, Matt, as an older, greyer and slappably unwiser version of Joey from Friends! It has Tamsin Greig! And Kathleen Rose Perkins! And it\u2019s really underwhelming! Part of the problem must be that, while we Brits relished every last drop of the earlier battles surrounding the fictional couple Tamsin and Stephen Mangan\u2019s sharp fictional script being dumbed down for America, the real US scriptwriters might now feel a touch of possibly justifiable unease at all the shrewd Briton/whalethick Statesider gags. And thus have to concentrate on affairs, and Matt/Joey\u2019s vaulting new stupidities. But it\u2019s a fresh series, and I\u2019ll let it settle in, and admittedly Mr Mangan\u2019s facial reactions to Matt\u2019s financial woes last week \u2013 turned out he\u2019d been scammed for half his lifetime earnings, and thus had \u201cjust\u201d $31m left \u2013 were as pricelessly and stoically old-country as old maids cycling through the morning mists on cheap and broken bikes.     Lee, from Stockton-on-Tees, in Benefits Street. Photograph: Richard Ansett    I almost couldn\u2019t stand, after t\u2019election, to go again down the avenue that is Benefits Street. The blaming and shaming, all the predictables. Glad I did though, because what was driven home (quietly, unstatedly: Love Productions and C4 showed but didn\u2019t tell) again was that there is, indeed, a true and vast gulf between the deserving and the undeserving poor. On the new street, in Stockton-on-Tees, where Love Productions were somehow wholly welcomed whereas weaselly national press were water-bombed \u2013 there\u2019ll be media studies doctorates on that \u2013 there was Lee, and there was Maxwell. Lee was a bit depressed, but nice enough, and wanted keenly to work. How he would find a job, when there were none locally and he had the world\u2019s most broken fridge, and had just had his benefits sanctioned \u2013 ie annulled \u2013 for forgetting just one appointment, was a\u2026 mystery. Maxwell, on the other, permitted a redefinition of the word odious.

A plan a year in the making was in danger of being undone at the eleventh hour. Garden designers expect to work in an intricate dance with the elements and the whims of their clients, but Dan had come up against a more intractable enemy: London\u2019s creaking Victorian infrastructure. A sewer ran under the site of his garden; Thames Water had decided that his design \u2013 in particular a couple of weeping willows \u2013 would put too much weight on it. \u201cThis is just what you have to do: design on the hoof,\u201d he said, directing JCBs and forklift trucks to move the weeping willows and rocks around a piece of land no bigger than a modest flat. \u201cIt\u2019s just the usual Chelsea madness, albeit on a slightly bigger scale.\u201d If you have not been to \u201cChelsea\u201d, imagine a marquee the size of two football pitches and 50ft high. Inside this tent are millions of flowers, row on flawless row. Surrounding it are tennis-court sized plots, each containing a show garden, with trees, plants and shrubs from all over the world in perfect bloom. Around these are hundreds of smart white tents where vendors sell everything from hot dogs to trowels. Now transpose the whole thing to a park on the Thames in the middle of London and fill it with 30,000 visitors, many of them pensionable and clutching copies of the Daily Telegraph. The show sits in the middle of a Venn diagram of class, art, horticulture and commerce, and it\u2019s possible that nothing else is quite as English. Garden designers can find it hard to ignore. Unlike other creative arts, most top-level garden design happens in private, behind the walls of wealthy clients. Chelsea is like all the fashion weeks rolled into one, as well as an enormous trade show and networking opportunity. It was here that Dan Pearson cemented his early reputation, winning a gold in 1996. In the years since, however, he has stayed away. Partly this is because his design practice has expanded and become one of the world\u2019s most respected. He and Huw Morgan, his co-director and long-time partner, employ a staff of seven and have 35 projects on the go, including a huge municipal project in Shanghai and private gardens in Palo Alto and Hawaii. Not forgetting his column in this magazine.         Dan Pearson directing the removal of stones from Chatsworth.    Another issue was the nature of Chelsea itself, where millions of pounds worth of garden are thrown up for a show lasting less than a week. Some gardens are simply there to show off: a Monaco-sponsored affair four years ago included a swimming pool. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in doing a garden that didn\u2019t have a life beyond a show,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI was disturbed by the waste of those gardens which are dismantled to nothing. But in the past 10 years Chelsea has changed: people are more geared up to the idea of things not being wasted. It\u2019s always been sophisticated in terms of plants, but people have got more savvy to messages about ecology and sustainability.\u201d But mainly he was persuaded by an offer from Laurent-Perrier, the Champagne house which has a long history of sponsoring Chelsea gardens, and Chatsworth, the stately home in Derbyshire that is home to the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. Using the house\u2019s grounds as inspiration, Dan would create something that would distil the garden and its history into a show garden. \u201cChatsworth is really an extraordinary place; there are stories everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were charged with finding something communicable in this garden that is all about big gestures.\u201d On a wet day in March, I met Dan in the grounds of Chatsworth and he explained his plan. He would draw on two areas: the rockery designed by Joseph Paxton, the Victorian engineer-cum-landscape architect who shaped Chatsworth\u2019s huge vistas, and the \u201ctrout stream\u201d, a narrow rivulet of water running in soft loops through the top of the garden. \u201cIt\u2019s very romantic,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut there\u2019s a roughness which serves as a counterpoint to the sophistication of these more formal landscapes. It\u2019s the perfect thing to bring back to the showground.\u201d The stones from the monumental rockery, which is more reminiscent of Petra than something you\u2019d find in your garden, would be loaded on to flatbed trucks and shipped down to London, then returned when the show was finished.     Making history: Chatsworth House, Derbyshire. Alamy Photograph: Alamy    On a wet day in April, the key figures in creating the garden sat around a table at the Crocus site in Surrey to work out how to turn Dan\u2019s vision into reality. Crocus is a plant nursery, and the secret heroes of the Chelsea Flower Show \u2013 in exchange for building some of the gardens, they are in prime position to sell punters any plants they are inspired to try at home. Peter Clay and Mark Fane, Crocus\u2019s founders, are the undisputed master alchemists of converting paper designs into mud and medals. In 11 years they have won 17 golds, and five best-in-shows in the past seven. In theory Chelsea might be an idealised showcase for horticultural dreamscapes, but in the run-up the reality is a chaos of diggers, trucks, cranes and heavy-booted labourers. To get a garden ready on time you must know exactly what is going to happen and when, and be prepared to adjust it all at the drop of a trowel. The Duke and Duchess were at the meeting, too, and David Hesketh from Laurent-Perrier, as well as Peter Harket, Crocus\u2019s sergeant-major on the ground. If the weather is the main antagonist in the Chelsea myth, then the Royal Horticultural Society represents the gods or fates. It is they who must be appeased, they who make the rules, and they who award the prizes. They are strict about how and when trucks and cranes can come and go, so the Crocus building plan must be exact. Budget must also be considered. A Chelsea garden can cost up to \u00a3500,000. Laurent-Perrier pays, but Crocus provides plants and landscaping at very good rates. Tensions can arise if a designer is too demanding. \u201cI was encouraged to make the best garden I could,\u201d said Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s been suggested that I row back a few times on some of the trees. But it\u2019s all been very gentlemanly.\u201d He worried about the wandering feet of the visitors to the show and the effect they might have on the fringes of his design. Hoi polloi are not allowed on to the gardens themselves, but nothing stops them craning and gawping from the side. Peter Clay suggested that a fence might help. \u201cPerhaps if you ran a current through it,\u201d Dan added. \u201cJust a little nip.\u201d Plants were monitored. In the unpredictable sun and rain of an English spring, plants grow at different speeds. They can be held back with fridges or accelerated with greenhouses, but an initial plant list is rarely the same as the final garden. \u201cI know we\u2019ve had a batch failure with the aquilegias,\u201d said Dan, \u201cso we\u2019ve accounted for that.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s very romantic\u2019: the trout stream at Chatsworth. Photograph: Jason Ingram/Observer    Other concerns seemed more mundane. Dan\u2019s plot was unusually large, occupying a triangle at the bottom of Main Avenue, Chelsea\u2019s focal point. This meant that the logistics of trucks were even more complex than usual. The sewer was mentioned. \u201cOur rocks are so heavy that the RHS is a bit concerned,\u201d said Clay. \u201cSeems reasonable,\u201d said the Duke. Notes were made to investigate further, although nobody foresaw the problems they would eventually face. Afterwards the party walked outside, where the garden was being mocked up, full-size. \u201cWe often lay out the planting plan,\u201d said Clay, \u201cbut this is the first time we have done the whole garden.\u201d A crane and a forklift stood by to help arrange the garden according to Dan\u2019s wishes. \u201cIf we possibly can, I think we should avoid moving those laburnums,\u201d said Clay. \u201cEach time the branches can be damaged and they get stressed.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019d like to see them in place, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Dan with a mild insistence, gesturing for the trees to be hoisted into place. If you have never seen a whole tree lifted 30ft in the air by a crane, I don\u2019t recommend it. It\u2019s like watching an elderly relative in some unusual and perilous situation. They don\u2019t belong there. To the untrained eye it was hard to see exactly what changes he was making as he moved bushes and rocks by a few inches. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of space, I think,\u201d said an assistant, \u201cbalancing these different elements.\u201d Even surrounded by rubble and only half-there, the garden had an undeniable elegance. The Duke was certainly pleased. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at the design,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way he has combined the various parts of the Chatsworth garden is just completely brilliant.\u201d It\u2019s surprising that making a Chelsea show garden resembles going into battle \u2013 Dan is the general, surrounded by a team of lieutenants and sergeants. The plants are the foot soldiers who must be placed in the right places while having their morale carefully maintained. On a wet day in May, Dan reflected on the chaos that the sewer had caused. \u201cThe past few days have been very tense. First, having to reshape some of this end of the garden. I\u2019ve lost my triumphal arch of willows, so I need to create the same kind of drama slightly differently. But also we had all the team here, standing around for three days with nothing to do. If we don\u2019t get everything done in time, we\u2019ll lose the access for our diggers. But there are consolations. I\u2019m happy. The plants have come up brilliantly. The laburnums are going to be perfect, although we won\u2019t get the honeysuckle in time.\u201d During a short break between rain showers, Dan oversaw things as the Crocus team swarmed over his garden, amending the plans to fit the sewer. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could come back again and not do something on this scale. Being brave has really helped us to convey a sense of the scale of Chatsworth. When I first came here all those years ago it was just us doing everything ourselves; now we have all these people helping. You learn a bit more with each garden you do. How everything works. How to manage this kind of unpredictable event.\u201d And what about the glittering prizes? \u201cI have to think about winning a gold for the sponsors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for myself I just want to make a garden we are happy with. I really mean that. It\u2019s exciting, fitting it all together. Yesterday I was completely lost in what I was doing. It felt like being a child again: joy.\u201d  The Chelsea Flower Show is on 19-23 May (rhs.org.uk) Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter @ObsMagazine", "tags": ["Chelsea flower show", "Gardening advice", "Gardens"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-17T09:00:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/18/48-hours-in-melbourne-what-to-do-where-to-go", "sentences": ["Photograph: /flickr    8pm, dinner  If you\u2019re on a budget, head to Chinatown for cheap dumplings at the legendary Shanghai Dumpling House, followed by a beer at Section 8 (shipping containers in a vacant lot) or, for a more upmarket but still affordable dumpling experience, head to the three-storey Hutong Dumpling Bar off Bourke Street."], "title": "48 hours in Melbourne: what to do, where to go", "article": "A weekend in Melbourne? It\u2019s never long enough. As with any hometown, it\u2019s a place filled with old friends and heavy with memories and associations. I live in Sydney now \u2013 but each time I return to Melbourne I not only get nostalgic for the past, but excited for what the city continues to become.  Melbourne reminds me of a glorious old house with rooms inside rooms inside rooms. Each new visit, a new door is opened \u2013 and behind it might be a daring restaurant, a park I hadn\u2019t visited, a bar down a laneway I\u2019d walked past a million times but had never noticed.    Melbourne reminds me of a glorious old house with rooms inside rooms inside rooms    A city is only as exciting and creative as its citizens and that bodes well for Melbourne. No one city in Australia has a monopoly on good conversation, but in Melbourne it has a tendency to flow. It could be something to do with where we meet; Melbourne\u2019s best bits are tucked away. It\u2019s a city of interiors \u2013 cafes, restaurants, bars, galleries, bookshops \u2013 places that are good for talking. My Melbourne is mostly northside, a city of the back streets of Fitzroy, late nights on Smith Street, walks or bike rides in Clifton Hill, Sunday markets at the Abbotsford convent, the movies and dinner in Carlton, the bars of Gertrude Street.  But speak to someone who lives to the south, in Elwood or St Kilda or Prahran, and their Melbourne will be of bays and beaches, the nightclubs of Chapel Street, the avenues of Albert Park, the antique stores of Armadale and the boutiques of Brighton. The one thing that unites north and south is a love of AFL \u2013 so if you are in Melbourne over a winter weekend, make sure you catch a game at the \u201cG\u201d. I\u2019m back regularly but these days need to confine my visits to a 48-hour period. So I\u2019ll come in on a Friday afternoon on a Tiger flight and then get the Skybus ($18) to the old Spencer Street station, now known as Southern Cross station. That road in from the airport, flat and long, industrial, usually under low grey skies, unimproved by the splashes of colour and distraction of the Jeff Kennett-era bridges, never hints at Melbourne\u2019s rich hinterland. This is a place where you have to know where to go, because unlike Sydney the good stuff doesn\u2019t just jump out at you. Friday 3pm, coffee and book shops After getting the Skybus from the airport , and buying a Myki transport card (from a 7/11 or newsagents), head into the CBD and grab a coffee. Melbourne\u2019s caffeine scene is justifiably world-famous, and even the most modest looking sandwich bar will serve you a decent coffee.     Taking a tram is one of the joys of being in Melbourne. Photograph: Picasa/Moment Editorial/Getty Images    I take a tram up from Southern Cross station to the Paris end of town at the corner of Bourke and Spring. I recommend a visit to the nearby Pellegrini\u2019s at the top of Bourke Street \u2013 one of the first cafes to open in Melbourne (in 1951). The coffee here is a bit bitter but for a slice of Melbourne\u2019s history it\u2019s worth dropping into the family-run business and downing a cup from your seat at the counter. Pellegrini\u2019s also serves up hearty Italian fare for around $20 for a plate of pasta. In the vicinity is City Wine Shop. It\u2019s a lovely bar at night, surrounded by a wall of bottles and low lighting and frequented by journos and political types from Spring Street (hence the need for dim lighting),but during the day they do a reliably smooth, almost creamy flat white. There\u2019s also a selection of top shelf wines to take away. After you\u2019ve had your caffeine fix, visit two of Melbourne\u2019s best bookstores just round the corner in Bourke Street. Hill of Content, a stately institution on the corner of Bourke and Exhibition, has very knowledgeable staff, while the more raffish Paperback, again on Bourke Street, is also worth exploring, particularly its bargain table. It\u2019s impossible to leave either store without purchasing something. 4pm, check in, Sheraton Hotel I stay at the new Sheraton at the Spring Street end of Little Collins Street, which is a tall, elegant hotel with a rooftop bar and spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. There\u2019s been a dearth of new hotels in the city for a number of years but now they are springing up all over the place. As well as the Crown Metropol, there\u2019s the Langham, a rash of art hotels (the Cullen, the Olsen and the Blackman), the new Hilton Double Tree down by Flinders Street station and, opening late last year, the Sheraton at the top of Little Collins Street.    There\u2019s been a dearth of new hotels in the city for a number of years but now they are springing up all over the place.    If you prefer something a little more homey, I can recommend the Brooklyn Arts Hotel in a converted Fitzroy terrace just off the uber-cool Gertrude Street. 6pm, pre-dinner drinks Not far from the Sheraton, in the Meyers Place laneway, there are enough little bars for a mini-crawl before dinner.  The sort-of unnamed (ie there\u2019s no sign) Meyers Place Bar is one of the original Melbourne laneway bars from the 1990s and still one of the best. It\u2019s simple and unpretentious, with recycled timber furniture, good music and not-too-pricey drinks.     Pelligrini\u2019s - right next to The Paperback bookstore. Photograph: /flickr    Nearby, if you feel like something fancier, a cocktail perhaps in luxe art deco surroundings, head next door to Lily Blacks. 8pm, dinner, Flinders Lane A few years ago, Melbourne was hit by a new phenomenon: queues of people standing outside restaurants, sometimes for an hour or more, waiting for a table. The wave of super-hot, no-booking restaurants included Chin Chin (Asian fusion) and Mamasita (Mexican).  It\u2019s to Chin Chin, I head, sans booking, for dinner. The wait is a mere 15 minutes this time and I am offered a seat at the bar in the meantime.  Dishes on offer (bring a heap of people with you and order everything to share) include crispy barramundi and green apple salad, salt and pepper soft-shell crusted crab and the twice cooked beef short rib. If you can\u2019t decide, for $69 a person staff will give you a selection of their favourite dishes. Other great restaurants in Flinders Lane (an absolute dining hot spot) include Coda, Supernormal and Cumulus Inc. 10pm, after-dinner and up late, Cherry Bar There\u2019s a load of bars in the city, and half the fun is wandering around and finding them yourself (look out for things like a dim light above the door, or a queue of people down a laneway lining up behind a bin) but why not walk up a few blocks to ACDC Lane and see some live music? Cherry Bar is an institution \u2013 unpretentious, gritty and dedicated to live music. It became famous for turning away Lady Gaga because it had a previous booking with a local band \u2013 and it is this loyalty to the Melbourne music scene, and dedication to providing a space for emerging bands, that has earned it so many die-hard fans. It\u2019s also a lot of fun, particularly late at night. The carpet is sticky, the characters by the bar in the cowboy hats can be kooky, the music is loud, but this is the real deal and there are gigs on every night.  Saturday  10am, brunch, Gertrude Street  The Sheraton does a great breakfast but if you feel like exploring outside your hotel, head towards Fitzroy where Brunswick and Gertrude streets have lots of great brunch options.    Fitzroy's Brunswick and Gertrude streets have lots of great brunch options.    You don\u2019t have to be vegan to enjoy Smith and Daughters \u2013 just be prepared to enjoy your latte with soy. The eggs with a Mexican twist are excellent. For those lusting after bacon, De Clieu on Gertrude Street around the corner does a great Berkshire pork neck breakfast. 11am, a city walk Head back towards the city for a spot of shopping. Melbourne has always had the edge over other Australian cities when it comes to shopping \u2013 you just have to walk through the Block and Royal arcades to see the exquisite detail in the mosaic tiles and ceiling details. The evergreen Hopetoun Tea Rooms in the Block Arcade is a great example of where Melbournites of yore (and still today) would take a break from their shopping at David Jones or Myer and enjoy a lavish cake or solid scone with a strong cup of tea.     The interior of the Hopetoun Tea Rooms. Photograph: Alpha/flickr    For newer and flashier shopping try the refurbished GPO on the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth streets or Emporium at Melbourne Central, which opened last year and features local designers such as Scanlan and Theodore, Gorman, Godwin Charli, Arthur Galan, 124 Shoes, Mr Simple and Autonomy alongside international brands including Uniqlo. 2pm, AFL match at the MCG Head over to the Melbourne Cricket Ground for an afternoon game. Any game. Nothing beats an afternoon walking to the MCG through leafy East Melbourne with thousands of others.      AFL is more than a sport in Melbourne, it\u2019s a way of life. Photograph: Scott Barbour/Getty Images    Even before they are named, Melbourne babies are swaddled in team colours. It\u2019s more than a sport, it\u2019s a tribe you belong to for life.  So pick a team, go to a game and barrack with the best of them.  6pm, rooftop bars After the footy, right on dusk, it\u2019s time to explore some of Melbourne\u2019s famous rooftop bars. The city has some of the best this side of Manhattan; there\u2019s even a new \u201ccamping\u201d hotel on one rooftop (at Melbourne Central).  My favourite rooftops for a drink include Rooftop Bar (at Curtin House, which also houses the excellent Cookie and Toff), Siglo, the goddess of rooftop bars in the same building as the Supper Club and overlooking Parliament House, Goldilocks, the quirky Madame Brussels and Fitzroy\u2019s Naked in the Sky.     Melbourne from Cookie rooftop bar. Photograph: /flickr    8pm, dinner  If you\u2019re on a budget, head to Chinatown for cheap dumplings at the legendary Shanghai Dumpling House, followed by a beer at Section 8 (shipping containers in a vacant lot) or, for a more upmarket but still affordable dumpling experience, head to the three-storey Hutong Dumpling Bar off Bourke Street. If you have a bit more cash to splash, I suggest dinner at the fabulous Asian-inspired Supernormal (in Flinders Lane) followed by an after-dinner drink at Cumulus Up. Sunday  5am, hot-air ballooning It\u2019s an early start (an hour before sunrise), but Melbourne and Canberra are the only two of Australia\u2019s capitals to allow hot-air ballooning over the CBD, so it\u2019s worth adding to your itinerary if your budget allows \u2013 it\u2019s up to $470 per person.  When I lived in Melbourne, I would emerge bleary-eyed for an early shift and see a flotilla of hot-air balloons drift across the dawn sky.  Now I\u2019m in one with around 10 others and it\u2019s exhilarating. To look down over the MCG, to float above the office blocks and church spires, to see across to the beaches of Frankston and bays of St Kilda, where even the brown of the Yarra is sparkling in the kind morning light, is to see the city with new eyes.  And then there\u2019s the peace of it. It\u2019s so gentle and in the basket there\u2019s a sense of stability. After an hour in the air, we land near the zoo with a small thud and a tinge of regret at being back on the ground.  Head back to your hotel for breakfast, or do as I did and join your fellow balloon travellers for breakfast and debrief in the dining room at the Pullman in East Melbourne.     Melbourne from hot air balloon. Photograph: /flickr    11am, Royal Botanical Gardens, East Melbourne Number plates in Victoria used to proclaim it as the \u201cgarden state\u201d. Two of my favourite gardens are the Treasury Gardens on the city fringe and the adjoining Royal Botanical Gardens in East Melbourne.  They are lovely places to explore, run around (you often hear Melbourne people talk about running the \u2018Tan\u2019) or just take a newspaper or book, find a bench and relax in the quiet, green spaces. 12.30am, lunch, Le Jardin Tan It\u2019s appropriate your 48 hours in Melbourne should end with yet more food.  Shannon Bennett\u2019s latest eatery, located at the Observatory Cafe at the Botanical Gardens, is a cafe and bar that reinterprets Vietnamese food as it was under the country\u2019s French colonial rulers.

Back in Australia, where he grew up, to restage his 1999 production of Don Carlos for Opera Australia, the UK-based director takes aim at the orthodoxy that opera is dying, salutes the absence of statesmen on the global political stage and calls Melbourne a city of beauty.  And all while discussing Verdi\u2019s epic clash of the titans, with its terrifying Grand Inquisitor staring down the tyrannical King Philip of Spain. \u201cIt is one of the great operas because it does discuss religious and political ideas,\u2019\u2019 says Moshinsky of Don Carlos. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only a love story or sentimental story about a death.\u2019\u2019 Ideas fire Moshinsky, they always have, especially the central conflict of Verdi\u2019s opera: personal liberty versus the power of the church and state. The director was initially poised for a life in academia. He taught history at Melbourne University before winning a scholarship to study Russian liberalism at Oxford, where he veered into \u201cshowbiz\u201d, as he calls it.     A conservative art form like opera can still allow you to present a dissident point of view       He remains a liberal and humanist, although he no longer calls himself a leftwing director. \u201cLeftwing doesn\u2019t sort of mean anything any more. I certainly come from what I call the dissident tendency, even though I\u2019m directing in the most conservative art form there is,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cA conservative art form can give rise to discussions of political ethics which allow you to present a dissident point of view.\u2019\u2019 The dissident director, 69, has an international career in opera, theatre and television and has had a long association with Opera Australia \u2013 his Rigoletto and La Traviata have been cornerstones of the company\u2019s repertoire for years. But he has not worked with the company since Don Carlos premiered 16 years ago.  Much has changed since then. \u201cI think I\u2019m a better producer,\u2019\u2019 he says of his own work. \u201cWhen I did it previously, the problems of just staging it overwhelmed the content. It was a bit overdecorated it, so I\u2019m simplifying it.\u201d     Moshinsky on Don Carlos: \u2018It isn\u2019t only a love story.\u2019 Photograph: Jeff Busby    Overwhelming too was the furore that erupted ahead of opening night when, as he exited a particularly taxing Sydney rehearsal, Moshinsky told an interviewer that musical standards in the orchestra were appalling. \u201cI had a tizzy fit,\u2019\u2019 he says now. \u201cThe frustrations of the moment took over ... I had to apologise and my apology had to be put on the desk of every orchestra member.\u201d He is more cautious when asked about musical standards today \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a different orchestra\u201d \u2013 and denies any rift with the company in the aftermath of the row. Rather, ill-health meant he could not travel. He was diagnosed with lymphoma some years ago and that made working in Australia impossible, he says. Moshinsky approaches Verdi, a liberal whose political views informed his work, with a historian\u2019s eye. But he views the composer\u2019s 19th-century world, with its grand historical narratives and towering political figures, as vastly different from ours.    We are lucky to live in an age when political decisions are made by consensus       \u201cWe no longer believe in history and we don\u2019t have statesmen,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cWe are very lucky to live in an age without statesmen, because we live in an age when political decisions are made by consensus. I would much prefer to live now. I\u2019m not nostalgic for the past. I don\u2019t want to live in the age of Bismarck, or indeed Margaret Thatcher.\u201d Born in Shanghai to Russian parents, one of his earliest memories is seeing Mao Zedong enter the city in 1951. His family fled to Melbourne soon after where he lived until the 1970s, studying flute at the conservatorium \u2013 \u201cI had no ability\u201d \u2013 before setting his sights on an academic career. With Don Carlos opening in Melbourne before transferring to Sydney, he has reacquainted himself with his former home \u2013\u201cthe most wonderful city to live in\u201d, he says. \u201cHere things open up to you, the living is easier and the attitude to life is more relaxed.\u201d   Related: New opera in Australia: it's not over till Senator Brandis sings    He will return to England after the Melbourne opening where he has another heretic to burn. He will direct Verdi\u2019s little known opera Giovanna d\u2019Arc for Buxton Festival. Although staging expensive grand opera is increasingly rare, Moshinsky rejects suggestions that the art form is on life support. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying the writing of novels is over,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cThe writing of novels isn\u2019t over. New people come along with new ideas ... [opera] will change, it won\u2019t be the same art form we had 30 years ago, but I don\u2019t fear for its future.\u201d And while Don Carlos \u2013 the grandest of grand operas \u2013 is a work of its time, its central dilemma remains pertinent. \u201cIt really goes into the paradox of human existence, that actually our destiny is not to live life fulfilled on Earth,\u201d he says. \u201cOur destiny is to learn how to live when your life is not fulfilled on Earth.\u2019\u2019  Don Carlos is at the Arts Centre, Melbourne from 20-29 May and the Sydney Opera House from 14 July to 15 August   ", "tags": ["Opera", "Classical music", "Australia news", "Culture", "Music", "Giuseppe Verdi", "Melbourne", "Sydney"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-18T09:23:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/may/18/why-hong-kong-is-clamping-down-on-creative-writing", "sentences": ["Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference of Shanghai, was appointed from the very top \u2014 by Hong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing chief executive, CY Leung."], "title": "Why Hong Kong is clamping down on creative writing", "article": "Last month, City University of Hong Kong abruptly shut down its MFA programme in creative writing. During Occupy Central \u2013 the campaign of mass civil disobedience that disrupted Hong Kong universities and brought part of the territory to a standstill for nearly three months last year \u2013 a number of our students had published essays in support of the demonstrations.  One of the most prominent was by lawyer Keane Shum, who wrote in Atlantic of his fears for Hong Kong in the face of increasing political interference from China. He said: \u201cI choose words of protest. Others can bet against the march of democracy, but I still go with the better odds. I am a student no longer, but a dreamer, and a Hong Konger, always.\u201d For many in my generation, the images of class boycotts, calls for face-to-face meetings with senior leaders, and the decision by students to put their bodies in the way of police lines, brought back memories of the Tiananmen demonstrations of 1989. For writers, literature is a carrier of history. In Chinese, the word remembrance, j\u00ec y\u00ec, is a pun that can be heard two ways, \u8bb0\u5fc6 (to recall, record) and \u6280\u827a (art). In the aftermath of Occupy Central, a chilling effect has taken root in Hong Kong\u2019s academic institutions, most palpably in the territory\u2019s top institution, Hong Kong University, described two weeks ago by media as \u201ca campus on edge\u201d. In February, 1,083 Hong Kong academics signed a petition condemning political intervention in the academic sphere, including the blocking of appointments and growing intrusions into freedom of expression and publication. That same month, The Lowy Institute for International Policy, an independent thinktank based in Sydney, named education as the next Hong Kong battleground. Xi Jinping\u2019s government, the Institute notes, \u201cmaintains China has a national interest in education policy and must \u2018correctly guide\u2019 schools. That\u2019s taken by local teachers to mean \u2018obedience and loyalty, rather than freedom and critical thinking\u2019.\u201d As an unnamed professor told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cIt is done implicitly not explicitly,\u201d while delivering \u201ca very clear message that you should keep silent, and focus on your own research.\u201d At our own City University, the chairman of the council, the highest governing body, is Herman Hu Shao-ming, a businessman and mainland adviser widely considered a political appointee. Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference of Shanghai, was appointed from the very top \u2014 by Hong Kong\u2019s pro-Beijing chief executive, CY Leung.  When the MFA programme at City University invited me, in 2010, to be part of the founding faculty, I accepted for a very specific reason: I wished to learn what a multilingual, multi-canonical literary workshop might look like. Hong Kong\u2019s programme is low-residency: the students work individually with international writers, and gather in Hong Kong for a series of week-long workshops.      Pro-democracy student protesters outside Hong Kong\u2019s government buildings in October 2014. Photograph: Wally Santana/AP    Our students, who write in English, come from 20 different countries and multiple languages. They include mainland Chinese who are looking for another way to express themselves; Americans from small towns who have built new lives in Seoul or Suzhou; lawyers, teachers, parents and journalists living and working in Asia. Fifty-two per cent are resident in Hong Kong itself. The literature we value arrives not only from writers renowned in New York and London, but from a spectrum of classical and avant-garde literature being written in, among other places, China, India, Nigeria, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  In an interview with China Daily, the novelist Junot D\u00edaz, who visited the programme in 2012, said:  \u201cThat\u2019s how impressed I was with the programme, with its mission, its students, staff and faculty: I was ready to relocate to Hong Kong for the opportunity to be a part of their vision. I\u2019ve never been to an MFA programme anywhere that tempted me with its excellence the way CityU did.\u201d Although Pulitzer prize winners D\u00edaz and Rae Armentrout, and the extraordinary Chinese poet, Ouyang Yu, have visited the MFA, the students know full well that a programme like ours cannot ease their path to publication. Hong Kong is not New York; powerful agents and editors do not visit us. To be frank, they do not know that we exist. Writing in English in Asia \u2013 a fraught choice as well as a liberating one \u2013 means these writers are inevitably working from the periphery. How can it evaluate its success? Since the programme\u2019s inception in 2010, six of our students have published highly regarded books; this is, however, not the only measure. The students know that literature from America and England \u2013 countries they may never have the chance to visit \u2013 has transformed them, and they also know that this world literature includes them. In what other MFA programme is this a founding principle? There are many more stories and ways of telling, if only we have the ears to hear them.

Their habitat is shrinking, they are incredibly fussy eaters and they have an unusually lacklustre approach to sex.   Now scientists have discovered that the bears are also poorly adapted for digesting bamboo, despite the plant being almost the only thing they eat. The research shows that two million years after shifting to a herbivore lifestyle, the giant panda still has carnivore-like gut bacteria, which is better at breaking down protein.   The discovery could explain some of the animal\u2019s more baffling traits, including spending almost every waking hour eating and its apparent indifference towards attempts at reproduction.  Zhihe Zhang, director of the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, China, and lead author, said: \u201cUnlike other plant-eating animals that have successfully evolved anatomically-specialised digestive systems to efficiently deconstruct fibrous plant matter, the giant panda still retains a gastrointestinal tract typical of carnivores. The animals also do not have the genes for plant-digesting enzymes in their own genome. This combined scenario may have increased their risk for extinction.\u201d  Iain Valentine, Director of Giant Pandas at Edinburgh Zoo, described the findings as \u201chugely interesting and an important piece of the panda\u2019s evolutionary jigsaw.\u201d  Giant pandas evolved from bears that ate both plants and meat, and started eating bamboo exclusively about two million years ago. It is unclear what triggered the shift away from meat \u2013 possibly the lack of available prey or the relative abundance of bamboo. Scientists believe that the transition to a herbivore lifestyle may have become permanent, however, because pandas are known to have lost the gene for the savoury \u201cumami\u201d taste receptor. \u201cWe think they lost the gene that is the driver behind them wanting to eat meat,\u201d said Valentine.  But while they lost their taste for meat, they do not appear to have developed any of the usual digestive apparatus of herbivores. They retain a carnivore\u2019s digestive system, with a simple stomach and a short intestine rather than the four-chambered stomachs that cows rely on to digest plants efficiently.  The latest study shows they also lack the gut flora that would allow them to extract most energy from fibrous plant material.  As a result, pandas spend up to 14 hours each day consuming up to 12.5 kg (27.5 pounds) of leaves and stems, but digest only about 17% of it. To conserve energy, the bears also spend up to 12 hours each day sleeping, giving the impression of an animal that eats purely to have enough energy to carry on eating.  In the study, published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mBio, the scientists sequenced the bacteria from 121 faecal samples from 45 giant pandas living in Zhang\u2019s Research Base. Samples were obtained during the spring, summer and late autumn of one year. The pandas typically ate at least 10 kg of bamboo leaves and shoots each day, and 500 to 800g (1.1 to 1.7 pounds) of steamed bread.  The gut bacteria was found to be similar to that of carnivorous and omnivorous bears, but very different from other plant eaters. The panda lacked plant-digesting bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroides and instead had guts dominated by Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus, which are efficient at processing proteins. \u201cThis result is unexpected and quite interesting, because it implies the giant panda\u2019s gut microbiota may not have well adapted to its unique diet, and places pandas at an evolutionary dilemma,\u201d said Xiaoyan Pang, of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a co-author.  Valentine said the findings add to the picture that the panda has adopted an almost unique digestive strategy. \u201cThe upside is they\u2019ve got a digestive system that deals with very large volumes of material very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to remember there aren\u2019t many predators around so they\u2019ve got the time on their hands to sit around eating all day.\u201d  He added that the findings may help to inform an ongoing study in Edinburgh, involving the zoo\u2019s pair of pandas Tian Tian and Yang Guang, into colic, which often afflicts pandas and is also thought to be linked to changes in gut microbes. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in humans,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cThey get stomach cramps, go off their food and lie in a heap for a few days.\u201d  The inefficiency of the panda\u2019s digestive system could explain the animal\u2019s apparent reluctance to reproduce. Female pandas ovulate only once a year, in the spring, and have a window of only two to three days around ovulation when they are able to conceive.  The embryo then has a couple of months of \u201cdelayed implantation\u201d when it remains in a state of arrested development until it attaches to the uterus and starts to grow.  Scientists now think that the precise timing of conception, implantation and birth may all be driven by the seasonal availability of different nutrients in bamboo plants.  \u201cThe accusation that they\u2019re rubbish at reproducing isn\u2019t really fair,\u201d said Simon Watt, author of The Ugly Animals: We Can\u2019t All be Pandas. \u201cThey bred OK in the wild. Part of the problem now is that the small population means that the pandas that are bumping into each other are all related.\u201d  ", "tags": ["Science", "Wildlife", "Biology", "Microbiology", "Zoology", "Animals", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-19T14:40:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/19/the-truth-behind-peabodys-campaign-to-rebrand-coal-as-a-poverty-cure", "sentences": ["Nowhere more so than when Jing recalls the beauty of the (electrical) city neon lights in Shanghai when she first went there as a student."], "title": "The truth behind Peabody's campaign to rebrand coal as a poverty cure", "article": "The story Linda Jing tells in the video is slick and persuasive: she was a girl from a poor village forced to study by candlelight because there was no electricity until coal-fired power plants arrived, transforming her destiny and that of China. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy life,\u201d Jing says, whose school was an old temple. \u201cWe actually had to bring our own little oil lamp or homemade candles for some of the school sessions.\u201d The children had to go there very early, often in the dark, she recalls.     In the three-minute video, \u2018From Candles to Computers: Bringing Electricity to China\u2019s Jing Jin village\u2019, she says: \u201cThe coal industry is a major force in eliminating fuel poverty in China but, more importantly, it\u2019s a critical driving force for the phenomenal economic growth China has experienced.\u201d        The video comes with a soothing soundtrack of traditional Chinese music, and is beautifully shot. Nowhere more so than when Jing recalls the beauty of the (electrical) city neon lights in Shanghai when she first went there as a student.

Contrary to the impression the video viewer might form, she was brought up in relative prosperity. She studied hard, emigrated and is now an executive at Monsanto, the agriculture and biotech giant, headquartered in St Louis, Missouri. Not that there is any mention of her work in the video.  Nor does Jing reveal that this is a video produced at the behest of Peabody Energy, the world\u2019s largest privately-held coal mining company, which also has its headquarters in St Louis. The two industrial giants are a 20-minute drive apart, and she was approached to appear in the video after a women\u2019s networking event involving the companies.

Photograph: Advanced Energy For Life    Bringing Electricity to China\u2019s Jing Jin village was posted to YouTube on 2 March this year \u2013 about six months after Britain\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority asked Peabody to withdraw an advertisement about \u201cclean coal\u201d because it was misleading. The regulator rejected two other complaints against the ad brought by the World Wildlife Fund. The message in the Linda Jing video is clear \u2013 coal is the solution to poverty in developing nations. It is Peabody\u2019s bold attempt to change the conversation away from climate change, and it has embraced it with gusto on its Advanced Energy for Life website.  Long before Linda Jing, Peabody stood apart from other coal, oil and gas companies for its open rejection of mainstream climate science and its hardline opposition to domestic regulations and international agreements that would put limits on carbon pollution. Peabody\u2019s links to the parallel universe of the climate denial movement stretch back to the early 1990s when Fred Palmer, who is now Peabody\u2019s main lobbyist as vice-president of government affairs, founded the Greening Earth Society, an industry front group. It actively promoted the notion that climate change was a net positive, with benefits for plants and public health.   Related: Peabody Energy exploited Ebola crisis for corporate gain, say health experts    A decade later, Peabody hired as its chief environmental adviser Craig Idso, the co-founder and former president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, a thinktank that has attacked mainstream climate science. The center maintains that rising carbon dioxide emissions \u201cbrings growth and prosperity to man and nature alike\u201d. The company has launched several law suits to try to beat back regulations on acid rain, mercury, and other pollutants, and it has led the broad industry pushback against Barack Obama\u2019s climate agenda and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules on carbon pollution that are at the heart of his plan. Earlier this year, Peabody hired Obama\u2019s former Harvard law professor, Laurence Tribe, to argue against the EPA rules in the supreme court. The hard line set Peabody apart from other coal companies \u2013 as did the sheer scale of operations. The company controls the biggest mines in the world, in the US and Australia, and has offices across Europe and Asia.  But Peabody lost $787m (\u00a3508m) last year, partly because of competition from cheap oil and natural gas, due to fracking, and the company has been hit hard by fossil fuel divestment campaigns. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund dumped their coal holdings late last year. Stanford University also got out of coal. The Guardian supports the fossil fuel divestment movement, and its Keep it in the Ground campaign has called on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, world\u2019s two biggest health charities, to divest from coal. As of the end of 2013, the Gates Foundation had $1.6m in Peabody holdings, according to Guardian analysis. The Wellcome Trust does not have any direct investments in the company.   Related: The real story of  US coal: inside the world's biggest coalmine    The changing fortunes for fossil fuels have led other coal, oil and gas companies to acknowledge climate change is occurring and caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas. But not Peabody \u2013 whose top executives continue to cast doubt on the existence of climate change. Palmer has gone so far as to claim that those who contribute to global warming by burning fossil fuels are doing \u201cgod\u2019s work\u201d. \u201cEvery time you turn your car on and you burn fossil fuels and you put C02 in the air you are doing the work of the lord,\u201d Palmer told an industry gathering in 2009. Peabody\u2019s chief executive, Greg Boyce, while purporting to endorse a transition to a low-carbon economy, regularly dismisses the \u201cflawed computer models\u201d as the basis of \u201cclimate theory\u201d. The Advanced Energy for Life website where Jing plays a starring role was launched in February 2104. Peabody says it has three objectives: combatting the crisis of global energy poverty, increasing access to low-cost electricity, and reducing emissions using today\u2019s advanced \u2018clean coal\u2019 technologies.  Campaigners say it is merely the latest example of the company\u2019s efforts to blur the connection between climate change and coal. In this case, the strategy was aimed at changing the conversation from climate change to poverty, and coal from culprit to cure.   Campaign sign up   \u201cThey have a long record of denial ... and this Advanced Energy for Life ploy is the latest example of that,\u201d said Kert Davies, founder of the Climate Investigations Center, which has carried out extensive research on the company. \u201cThey are literally trying to change the conversation. They are telling people climate change is not the problem. Poverty is the problem, and coal is the answer.\u201d  The Advanced Energy for Life campaign was crafted by Burson Marsteller, a public relations firm that worked with the Nigerian government and Argentina junta when they were accused of massacres and disappearances, and helped the nuclear, chemical and energy companies after environmental disasters. It was a ringer for a United Nations initiative, Sustainable Energy for All, launched by Ban Ki-moon in 2011, aimed at fighting poverty by expanding access to clean energy. The UN, the World Bank, governments and charitable foundations all see access to energy as a route out of poverty and fund efforts to hook villages up to the grid and expand access to cooking facilities in developing countries. But none of those initiatives involve coal. In stark contrast, the pro-coal version sponsored by Peabody on the Advanced Energy for Life website relies heavily on material from coal industry lobby groups and small ultra-conservative think tanks that deny the existence of climate change, such as the Heartland Institute. \u201cOur view is that the worst human and environmental crisis is not climate change,\u201d Vic Svec, Peabody\u2019s senior vice-president for global investor and corporate relations, told the Guardian in a telephone interview on 30 July last year. \u201cPulling those people out of energy poverty is of far greater urgency than the modelled crises that have been advanced.\u201d The argument that cheap coal could help end poverty in the developing world has been gaining traction, Svec said in an email this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to have good success with the campaign,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cA review last year in the months following our campaign launch in early 2014 showed that online discussion regarding energy poverty increased some 50% while clean coal discussion increased approximately 40%. We also saw a substantial increase in other major political and business leaders discussing the vital issue of energy poverty.\u201d  One of those figures was Bill Gates, who posted two videos on energy poverty by the climate contrarian Bjorn Lomborg on his Gates Notes blog in June last year.  \u201cMany developing countries are turning to coal and other low-cost fossil fuels to generate the electricity they need for powering homes, industry, and agriculture. Some people in rich countries are telling them to cut back on fossil fuels. I understand the concern,\u201d Gates wrote. \u201cBut even as we push to get serious about confronting climate change, we should not try to solve the problem on the backs of the poor.\u201d But for all the stated concern about poverty in developing countries, Peabody, unlike Gates or indeed several other big coal companies, has no record of funding programmes to reduce energy poverty. \u201cGlobal energy poverty requires a structural solution brought about by the wise choice of fuels and the wise choice of policies,\u201d Svec said in an email. \u201cThe entire mission of Peabody and our activities is driven around increasing access to reliable, low-cost energy.\u201d     The Peabody advert that UK\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority asked the company to withdraw because it was misleading. Photograph: Peabody    Instead, the solution proposed by Advanced Energy for Life, when the campaign first launched, was blocking the new rules in the US putting limits on carbon pollution for power plants, due to be finalised this summer. When the campaign launched, Peabody invited the public to \u201ctake action\u201d by writing the EPA to oppose the clean power plant rules as a way of helping poor people in Africa. The \u201ctake action\u201d option was later removed. And Peabody has admitted the true measure of success of its Advanced Energy for Life campaign will not be measured in developing countries, but by the degree to which it has managed to lead the attention away from coal as a cause of climate change. \u201cWe will achieve the highest level of success if we are able to change the global conversation to focus on energy poverty as the world\u2019s number one human and environmental crisis.\u201d Beth Sutton, Peabody\u2019s vice-president for global advocacy communications said.  Personal stories such as Jing\u2019s are critical to changing those conversations.  Jing told the Guardian that her appearance in the video was based on personal experience and had nothing to do with her professional position. She was not paid or compensated by Peabody.  She has prior experience as the face of industry campaigns. In 2006, she was the \u201cface of diversity\u201d for General Motors, her previous employer.      Trucks driving along a dust-covered access road to deliver coal to Datong Power Station in China. Photograph: Paul Souders/Corbis    Jing was born in 1974 in a farming suburb of Xian, the capital of Shaanxi province. Xian is known for its collection of terracotta warriors on the surrounding plains, but Shaanxi is the West Virginia of China. The province contains about a third of China\u2019s known coal deposits \u2013 and has more coal companies than any other province. In the mid-1970s, electricity in rural China was scarce and unreliable, with less than half of the country hooked up to the grid. But Jing\u2019s village was electrified when she was about five. Her home had a supply, but not the school. When she was 10, her father was appointed to an important post at the Datong Coal Mining Administration, then the most important coal fields in China, by the then premier Deng Xiaoping. Datong later became a state-owned corporation. There were hospitals, schools and a funeral home, the industry\u2019s contribution to society. By 1990, meanwhile, China had achieved nearly universal electrification. Chinese cities are now choking on dangerous air pollution, because of the reliance on coal.  Jing conceded that air pollution was a growing problem for China. But she was uncertain about the causes. It is a complex issue, she said. She didn\u2019t know how much coal contributed to it.  Last year was a difficult year for coal companies. As well as those $787m losses, because of competition from cheap oil and natural gas, due to fracking, Peabody was removed from the S&amp;P 500. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Stand &amp; Poor and others downgraded the company to \u201cunderperform\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d ratings. Its share price has fallen by more than 90% since 2011. This year will not be any better, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which provides independent analysis. US demand for coal for electricity is expected to shrink by 6%, because of cheap natural gas putting ageing coal-fired power plants out of business.   Graphic   The company came under additional pressure from incoming climate regulations and fossil fuel divestment campaigns. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency will finalise new rules this summer putting the first limits on carbon pollution from power plants. Even China \u2013 which Jing has hailed as an example of transformational change from coal \u2013 is moving away from coal, because of air pollution choking its cities. Beijing shut down a Datong Company coal plant serving the capital last year, and is scheduled to replace four more coal plants with natural gas by the end of 2016.  Peabody however appears undeterred. At the company\u2019s annual general meeting on 4 May, representatives from the New York City and California state pension funds sought to introduce a resolution about climate risks. It was immediately shot down. \u201cThere was an opportunity to have a bigger conversation about climate change,\u201d said Diana Best, senior coal campaigner for Greenpeace. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t materialise at all.\u201d The lobbyist     Fred Palmer, senior vice-president of government affairs for Peabody Energy. Photograph: Carlos Javier Sanchez/Getty Images    Fred Palmer, Peabody\u2019s main lobbyist, is deeply connected to the world of climate denial. The public face of Peabody\u2019s opposition to Barack Obama\u2019s climate change plan, Palmer had a record of attacking mainstream climate science that stretches back more than 20 years, well before he joined Peabody in 2001. Palmer now serves as the company\u2019s senior vice-president for global relations. In July last year he delivered the official Peabody response to new Environmental Protection Agency rules, opposing limits on carbon pollution to deal with what he dismissed as \u201cclimate theory\u201d. In the early 1990s, Palmer, then the lobbyist for the Western Fuels Association, a consortium of coal industry groups, founded the Greening Earth Society, one of the first industry front groups to promote misinformation about climate change. The Greening Earth Society actively promoted the \u2013 false \u2013 notion that climate change was actually a net positive, claiming that rising temperatures and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide would help plants grow. Palmer was also deeply involved in the campaign by the Information Council on the Environment (Ice), launched before the 1992 environmental conference, to persuade the public that climate change was not a threat. Some of the messages tested by Ice included: \u201cWho told you the Earth was warming ... Chicken Little\u201d, according to Naomi Oreskes in the book Merchants of Doubt. The Greening Earth Society is now defunct but Palmer continued to air his doubts about the existence and potential dangers of climate change. In 2009, Palmer went so far as to say that rising carbon dioxide emissions are good for the planet \u2013 part of doing \u201cGod\u2019s work\u201d. \u201cEvery time you turn your car on and you burn fossil fuels and you put C02 in the air you are doing the work of the lord,\u201d Palmer told an industry gathering. Palmer has toned down some of the rhetoric of late. But in public appearances he continues to accuse \u201cwell-funded groups\u201d of using climate regulations to put Peabody out of business. \u201cThere is a well-funded group out there that is pushing this agenda \u2026 that want to get into your pocketbooks,\u201d Palmer was quoted as saying in an appearance at an industry forum in St Louis. \u201cThey want to sell you the high-priced spread, and to do that, they\u2019ve got to take out (Ameren Missouri\u2019s) power plants, and they have to get people to quit using my product.\u201d  This article was amended on 20 May.

Self-harm, substance use and especially a tragically early death are graver public health issues in this voiceless population. In their past education history, Neets were more likely to have been eligible for free school meals and to have been been excluded from school. In terms of possible social disadvantage, Neets are more likely to be disabled and to come from ethnic minorities. Looked at another way, almost half the nation\u2019s 19-year-olds who have a disability have been Neet. Over half of Neets are young women, and the most telling statistic is the number of these females who were mothers by the age of 19.

Counselling services across FE are seeing unprecedented and escalating demand but precious little in the way of extra resources. As Tory funding cuts hit, some college services have been shortsightedly shrunk or even axed completely, leaving students with few options in the community, where austerity measures have overstretched mental health services and sunk charities. As for NHS therapy via the IAPT scheme, this often means waiting a long time for not very much at all. What a terrible message our young people are getting \u2013 in an increasingly complex world, we value your potential for work, but not your capacity to feel.Andy Rogers(Counsellor and service coordinator in further and higher education), Basingstoke, Hampshire \u2022 The NSPCC\u2019s figures that show the number of young people in Britain seeking counselling over exam stress has increased by 200% in recent years (Report, 14 May) are extremely concerning. Schools must have a duty to support their students, but the stark reality is that many schools do not have the networks in place to do so. This underlines the need to ensure that there is enough of a children\u2019s workforce to handle the rise in demand. Educational psychologists, for example, address a vast range of educational issues including emotional wellbeing and mental health, and they identify the specific support a child may require and advise teachers (and other professionals) on ways to tailor their services to address the child\u2019s individual needs. But this support simply will not be forthcoming if education support services continue to be stripped to the bone and stretched to breaking point. Educational psychology services are a case in point. The children\u2019s workforce is overworked and becoming increasingly fragmented, potentially leaving a huge number of vulnerable and stressed young people without access to much-needed services, putting them at considerable risk.Kate FallonGeneral secretary, Association of Educational Psychologists \u2022 The 2014 national curriculum document borrows Matthew Arnold\u2019s statement from Culture and Anarchy (1869) that culture involves \u201cgetting to know \u2026 the best that has been thought and said in the world\u201d. Arnold did not intend that pupils should be rigorously examined in this knowledge. Indeed, it seems clear he intended that this cultural knowledge should encourage \u201cfresh and free thought\u201d and not be learned \u201cmechanically\u201d. In the same text Arnold warns against \u201cthe great dangers of cramming little boys [sic] of eight or 10 and making them compete for an object of great value to their parents\u201d and \u201cthe dangers of cramming and racing little boys for competitive examinations\u201d.Peter ScalesElvaston, Derbyshire \u2022 Universities deserve credit for their work to reduce the stigma attached to student mental illness despite dwindling resources, but staff mental illness is also in dire need of attention. Our recent health survey revealed that 83% of university staff suffered stress, 67% anxiety and 45% depression in the past two years. The University and College Union found that stress levels relating to workload in higher education are even greater than levels for the British working population as a whole. In order to create an environment that truly enables effective learning, investment is needed in health and wellbeing support not just for students, but for staff too.Julian StanleyChief executive, Teacher Support Network Group \u2022 I have 30 years\u2019 experience as headteacher of three different schools in Kent. What Gaby Hinsliff says is so true (Opinion, 15 May), but as well as Sats children here have the 11-plus together with entrance exams for the grammar schools. They truly are tested to destruction. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Instead of thinking about programmes and tests, begin by thinking about children and how best they learn. By practising learning they will come to understand, and teachers are there to help. Fundamental to learning is the precious skill of choosing, of making responsible decisions: difficult but vital. Children must be encouraged to choose within their capacity to choose. Nor are teachers know-alls; they are learners too, and so are parents and governors, so schools should be where everyone comes to learn.\u00a0 Parents worry that they won\u2019t know the \u201cbasics\u201d. Most basic of all is being a rounded human being, confident in who you are. Next is the confidence that you are a problem solver, that being a learner you will use the traditional disciplines, because how else would you be able to find the answers? Children can read expectations like well-trained dogs. They soon know being successful is important and that that means remembering what to know. When that happens learning is dead. It is deeply ironic that parental choice was sold as power to parents but what we see is chronic alienation. Gaby Hinsliff has said it all.\u00a0Geoffrey MarshallPembury, Kent \u2022 Your article regarding exam stress among pupils taking GCSE and A-level exams was sad to read and, given the huge number seeking help, must be taken seriously by all involved in their education, including parents. As a state school teacher and university lecturer of many years, I think that the main cancer at the centre of our educational system is the fear of the league tables. Teachers are under great pressure to ensure that pupils get good grades and this can have a detrimental effect, meaning that many teachers teach to the exam and may put additional pressure on their pupils to do well. In certain subjects, teachers have been known to cheat when testing oral skills. I taught a student who had passed her GCSE French with a grade C and admitted to me after a few weeks that her result didn\u2019t reflect her ability. During the oral exam her teacher had paused the recorder and given her the correct answers.\u00a0 Horrified at first, I then had a certain sympathy for the teacher, who was so afraid that her pupils wouldn\u2019t get good grades that she was willing to take the risk of losing her job. League tables are not a good way of assessing the success of a school. Pupils who have private tuition to improve their grades or take on extra subjects outside the school curriculum will inflate the school\u2019s results. League tables put extra strain on both teachers and pupils and should be abolished immediately.Lorraine HaldaneSenior lecturer in French (retired), Hove, Sussex \u2022 I am a recently retired teacher who has spent the last few years doing supply teaching in local academies. Ever since Baker\u2019s reactionary school revolution, I\u2019ve seen the morale and professional autonomy of teachers nosedive. Latterly, with Gove\u2019s deformation of English schooling, I\u2019ve witnessed school governance and pressures on teachers and students reach crisis levels. We have the most over-monitored, over-assessed, stressed and demoralised students that I have experienced since starting teaching in 1972. Teachers are on a permanent Ofsted visit footing, which saps already battered reserves of resilience and wellbeing. The atmosphere in schools is becoming toxic \u2013 they are cracking under the combined assault of league tables and a punitive inspection regime. It is no wonder that our students are suffering acute anxiety and depression. We need to learn from cultures similar to ours. In Finland assessment is infrequent and appropriate and teachers have trusted professional autonomy over curriculum and pedagogy. Trying to ape schooling in places like Shanghai (the Pisa statistics from there are very dubious) is not sensible. Levels of stress and anxiety among Chinese students are similarly catastrophic.Philip WoodKidlington, Oxfordshire", "tags": ["Student health", "Mental health", "Young people", "Higher education", "Further education", "Teaching", "Students", "Cuts and closures", "Exams", "Children", "Schools", "Health", "Sats", "Public sector cuts", "GCSEs", "Society", "Education"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-20T17:28:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/burberry-shares-fall-slashes-profits-growth-guidance-by-80-fashion-currency-rates", "sentences": ["International events with a British theme helped raise the brand\u2019s profile, with London streets recreated in a Shanghai warehouse and James Corden, the Beckhams and the Queen\u2019s Grenadier Guards starring at a one-off fashion show in Los Angeles in April."], "title": "Burberry shares slide as foreign exchange gains fall away", "article": "Burberry shares have taken a hit after the luxury fashion retailer admitted it will get far less benefit from foreign currency gains than it had anticipated only a few weeks ago. Burberry had expected a \u00a350m boost from favourable foreign exchange movements, but yesterday the label warned that boost would now be just \u00a310m, as a result of currency movements including a rise in value of the pound against Hong Kong and US dollars. \u201cUnderneath, the numbers read well and are ahead of forecasts and the company is doing a lot to make the business sustainable, but lowering 2016 guidance has hurt Burberry today, and luxury is always going to be a choppy sector, quick to react to changes in consumer confidence,\u201d said Will Hedden, a dealer at London Capital Group. Trenchcoats, monogrammed scarves and check blanket ponchos, all made in Britain, underpinned sales growth during the financial year ending 31 March. The company beat City forecasts with an 11% rise in revenues to \u00a32.5bn and a 7% rise in pre-tax profit to \u00a3456m. But investors took fright after a slowdown in Asia, and Burberry shares were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, plunging more than 6% to 1697p.  Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, one of Burberry\u2019s most profitable markets, have damaged business in recent months. Tourism has fallen away in the territory, with fewer visitors from mainland China \u2013 who are typically big spenders.  The result was a mid-single-digit decline in Hong Kong spending during the second half of the year, the company said, accompanied by a slowdown in mainland China, but countered by a slight lift in Europe. A weaker euro also increased grey market sales, with unauthorised traders buying luxury brands in Europe and selling them at a profit in China and other Asian markets. Burberry responded by raising prices in Europe and reducing them in Asia. A decision to simplify the variety of trenchcoats on offer helped boost sales of the company\u2019s classic British-made garment, along with Scottish-made scarves, which can now be monogrammed via online order for \u00a375 on top of the \u00a3335 retail price. Burberry\u2019s finance chief, Carol Fairweather, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this absolute focus on our heritage icons, there is a lot more to come from the scarves and poncho story as we move forward this year.\u201d The trenchcoat, made from fabric woven in Keighley in Yorkshire and sewn nearby in Castleford, now uses cotton grown on Burberry\u2019s sustainably managed plantation in Peru.

Or is it the past? In Tomorrowland, Disney\u2019s new adventure movie, George Clooney and friends risk life and limb to reach the utopian realm of the title, and it looks pretty much like we expected the future to look, at least back in the 1960s: a pristine, shopping-mall sort of place with soaring glass spires and flying trains and happy people of all nations wearing coloured boiler suits. But here in the real world (a relative term, admittedly) you can visit Tomorrowland today. As many millions of visitors know, it is already an area of Disney\u2019s theme parks, devoted to the same type of optimistic techno-futurism Tomorrowland the movie espouses. You do not have to risk life and limb to get there, but it could cost you an arm and a leg. You can see the synergistic synapses firing in Disney\u2019s corporate brain at the prospect of a movie that retrofits a backstory on to its theme parks. What is more, it comes just in time for the 60th anniversary celebrations of the original Disneyland park in Anaheim, California, which kick off tonight with a huge show presented by Mickey Mouse and Oscars host Neil Patrick Harris. All of this serves to highlight the fact that, 60 years on, we are still not sure what to think about Disneyland. It is a place of paradox and contradiction. Both utopian and dystopian. Kind of cheesy, yet great fun. Eagerly forward-looking yet stiflingly conservative. It is neither pure fantasy nor is it quite reality. More like a portal between the two: a place where cinematic dreams take on three-dimensional form, while punters travel in the opposite direction, leaving behind their outside existence to become actors in a giant cartoon. Queuing alongside families to sample the Disney fantasy over the years have been philosophers and cultural commentators of every stripe, all primed to decipher its meanings \u2013 and perhaps to suffer a trip on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Perhaps it was the French theorist Jean Baudrillard who returned the most damning verdict: \u201cDisneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real,\u201d he pronounced in his 1988 book Simulations, \u201cwhen in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation.\u201d Reality has become a map without a territory, Baudrillard snootily surmised, and it is basically all Disney\u2019s fault. Those contradictions were there from the start. Indeed, the split between fantasy and reality is embodied in the hybrid term Walt Disney coined for the creators of his theme park: \u201cimagineers\u201d. So, too, Disney\u2019s Janus-like ambivalence toward progress is expressed in the plaque he unveiled at the opening in July 1955. \u201cHere age relives fond memories of the past \u2013 and here youth may savour the challenge and promise of the future,\u201d it reads. The sentiment was perfectly in tune with postwar America \u2013 a time and place of both space-age optimism and cold war uncertainty. More than fantasy, Disneyland provided security or as Karal Ann Marling\u2019s definitive study of Disney design put it, \u201cthe architecture of reassurance\u201d. Some have compared the layout of Disneyland to a map of Walt Disney\u2019s own psyche: You start by walking down Main Street USA \u2013 a pastiche of 19th-century smalltown life, modelled on Disney\u2019s sentimental memories of his childhood in Marceline, Missouri. Then you can branch off into other \u201cworlds\u201d of Disney\u2019s imagination. Most of them are nostalgic: Fantasyland, with its Sleeping Beauty Castle; Frontierland, infused with the spirits of Mark Twain and Davy Crockett; the exoticism of Adventureland, which was as close to abroad as most postwar Americans got (the Jungle Cruise ride was modelled on Bogart and Hepburn\u2019s The African Queen). And then there\u2019s Tomorrowland, where technology and science point the way to a shiny, happy future of inventions and space travel and nuclear-powered everything. At the time of opening, Tomorrowland was actually barely finished. A great many balloons were needed to fill in the gaps, apparently. It had been hastily cobbled together from the leftover sets of Disney\u2019s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and corporate-sponsored exhibits. There was the TWA \u201cmoonliner\u201d rocket ship, the plastic \u201cMonsanto House of the Future\u201d with Jetsons-style interiors and a microwave oven to cook your (presumably GM-free) meal, and the Kaiser Aluminium Hall of Fame, turning kids on to the wonders of \u2026 er \u2026 aluminium. The \u201ctomorrow\u201d of Tomorrowland was originally set at 1986. At least we got the microwave.     The real-life version of the attraction, at Disneyland in California. Photograph: Gamma-Keyston/Getty Images    But Walt Disney sincerely believed in the future he was selling, possibly even shaping, at Tomorrowland. When it relaunched in 1959, it introduced the first working monorail to the US. Another remodelling in 1967 brought the PeopleMover \u2013 a mini electric train system intended to point the way for future urban mass transport (the California original closed in 1995, the Florida one is still in operation). Walt Disney\u2019s futurist credentials led to him designing attractions for the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair, including the Carousel of Progress and It\u2019s a Small World, both of which he then brought back to Disneyland. By this time Disneyland was a runaway success, and the public were anticipating an east coast sequel, especially when it emerged that Disney had secretly been buying up a vast area of central Florida \u2013 twice the size of Manhattan. But building another Disneyland didn\u2019t really appeal to the company\u2019s founder. \u201cI would like to create new things,\u201d Walt Disney told reporters at a 1965 press conference in Florida. \u201cYou hate to repeat yourself. I don\u2019t like to make sequels to my pictures. I like to make a new thing and develop a new concept.\u201d What really appealed to Disney about \u201cthe Florida project\u201d, as it was then known, was not the theme park but the workers\u2019 town next to it. Visitors to the top floor of the Carousel of Progress would soon see what Walt Disney had in mind. There was installed a gigantic model of \u201cProgress City\u201d, a town for at least 20,000 people, with lights and moving cars and the glow of a nuclear power station in the distance. Progress City is surprisingly in step with current ideas of urban planning. With it, Walt Disney intended to right the wrongs he perceived in Los Angeles: too many cars, no pedestrian access, no civic centre, characterless modern architecture. Progress was a garden city of concentric rings, three miles wide. At its centre stood a 30-storey hotel surrounded by a compact indoor retail and business district, air-conditioned against the Florida humidity. Around that was a green belt with schools and leisure facilities, then a ring of low\u2011density suburbs, with industrial parks beyond. The roads were all underground. The primary means of getting around would be public transport: a monorail, a system of people movers, and walking. He redubbed it the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow: Epcot. Smarter still was Walt Disney\u2019s idea of how the city would operate: he would invite corporations to test their products on its citizens. If General Electric was developing a new microwave oven, for example, one would be put in every Epcot home for real\u2011world testing. Visitors would come to see what the city of the future looked like. \u201cIt will always be in a state of becoming,\u201d he explained in a promotional film. \u201cIt will never cease to be a living blueprint of the future, where people live a life they can\u2019t find anywhere else in the world.\u201d \u201cIt was a very clever concept,\u201d says Sam Gennawey, an urban planner and Disney historian, who conducted an unofficial feasibility study of the original Epcot. \u201cWalt was an empirical-data sort of guy. Everything he planned had been tested somewhere else. Everybody thinks of him as this master innovator, but his greatest skill was taking what he saw and knew worked and recombining it in ways that seemed new and novel.\u201d     The Epcot Center Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida. Photograph: Alamy    The only downside to Disney\u2019s utopia was the governance. Disney would own everything, and Epcot citizens would only be permitted to live there for up to a year, after which they would have to move on. Thus, nobody would ever acquire voting rights and subvert Disney\u2019s programme. Disney also cut a favourable deal with the Florida authorities, Gennawey explains. \u201cThey could go ahead and build a nuclear power plant or an airport without the permission of the state of Florida. They have rights within that property that are generally greater than those of most counties in the US.\u201d For better or worse, Epcot never came to pass. Disney\u2019s utopianism died with its master in 1966, and no one else had the stomach to build his dream city. Rather than the city of the future, Epcot became another theme park, more like a corporate-sponsored World\u2019s Fair. The only surviving vestige of Disney\u2019s prototypical community is the Disney-owned town of Celebration, Florida, a surreally twee place whose orderliness has drawn comparisons to Ira Levin\u2019s novel The Stepford Wives. In the theme parks, too, Tomorrowland ceased to anticipate the real future and instead focused on futuristic attractions: Captain EO, the 3D Michael Jackson musical, directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Star Tours, the Star Wars-themed simulator ride; the Space Mountain rollercoaster (look closely and you will spot it on the skyline of the film version of Tomorrowland). Tomorrowland the movie is a sincere attempt to address this lack of belief in the future, without which humanity could be doomed, it suggests. Looking at the present-day landscape, the real influence on the city of tomorrow was not Tomorrowland or Epcot but Disneyland itself. Many an architect and planner has admired it and borrowed from it. In 1963, Harvard professor James Rouse called it \u201cthe greatest piece of urban design in the United States today\u201d. Disneyland is a self-contained, controlled, pedestrian-friendly retail monoculture whose functions are overlaid with a veneer of narrative and fantasy, invisibly serviced and governed by regulations so repressive that employees have only been permitted to sport moustaches since 2000. As such, it has become the model for many an aggressively themed new residential development, shopping mall or casino resort, from Las Vegas to China to Dubai. Baudrillard\u2019s prophesy seems to have been fulfilled. \u201cDisney invokes an urbanism without producing a city,\u201d wrote architect Michael Sorkin in a scathing essay titled See You in Disneyland. \u201cRather it produces a kind of aura-stripped hyper-city, a city with billions of citizens (all who would consume) but no residents. Physicalised yet conceptual, it\u2019s the utopia of transience, a place where everyone is just passing through.\u201d Umberto Eco agrees. In his 1986 essay Travels With Hyperreality, he writes: \u201cAs an allegory of the consumer society, a place of absolute iconism, Disneyland is also a place of total passivity. Its visitors must agree to behave like robots.\u201d Do we still need Disneyland now that the rest of the world has been Disneyfied? Disney certainly thinks so. Walt Disney may be long gone but the corporation is bigger and hungrier than ever. Disneyland\u2019s model has been replicated outside the US in Tokyo, Paris and Hong Kong. The theme park side of Disney\u2019s operation earned nearly twice as much as its movies last year: $15bn versus $7bn. And it is still building. In the past 10 years, under its current chief executive Bob Iger, Disney has been on an unprecedented buying spree, snapping up prime movie properties Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilm for a combined total of more than $15bn. So as well as its menagerie of talking animals, its harem of fairytale princesses and its Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney\u2019s universe now encompasses characters from Buzz Lightyear to Spider-Man and Han Solo. It is remarkable just how much of the popular imagination the company has monopolised. These franchise-friendly properties will doubtless help Disney rule the box office, but they also provide plenty of new material for the theme parks. Already, Iger has promised \u201ca much larger Star Wars presence in our parks globally\u201d, with rides based on as-yet-unreleased movies. After Tomorrowland and Pirates of the Caribbean, itself a ride that inspired a movie franchise, there are plans for another film based on an existing Disney attraction: The Haunted Mansion, directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Ryan Gosling \u2013 a former Mouseketeer returning to the fold. Disney is now working on Shanghai Disney Resort, one of the most ambitious and expensive projects in its history. The corporation has already pumped $5.5bn into the resort, which is set to open next year. That is more than it paid for either Star Wars or Marvel. It will contain the largest fairytale castle yet, a new Pirates of the Caribbean ride, a theatre playing the Lion King musical and a Toy Story-themed hotel. Chinese-themed landscapes will also blend with all the traditional areas and attractions that Walt Disney laid out back in the 1950s. It will probably be the most visited tourist attraction in the world. To shore up the client base, the corporation has been rolling out its Disney English operation across China, which teaches the English language exclusively through the medium of Disney characters, priming the next generation in the ways of Mickey and Donald. This all sounds a long way from its Walt Disney\u2019s vision of the future. It is not yet known whether Shanghai Disney Resort will have a Tomorrowland, or what they will put in it if they do.

It\u2019s not even that clear, but the hazy sky is as blue as it gets here. Most days, the sky is obscured by a thick blanket of smog.  Baoding, a city of 10 million people, was named in February as China\u2019s most polluted city by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, based on air pollution figures gathered for 2014. By mid-May of this year, the city had only enjoyed 16 days of air quality that could be considered \u201cgood\u201d by the official classification. \u201cGenerally, there is smog on most days,\u201d says Mr Han, aged 66, who has lived in Baoding his whole life. He drives a motorbike that carries a carriage-like trailer, and parks outside the city\u2019s main supermarket to ferry shoppers home for a small fee. \u201cIt was much better when I was young \u2013 the air was very clean,\u201d he says. \u201cWe rarely see blue skies now.\u201d Expecting coal stacks and factories pumping out toxic fumes, I instead see farmland whizzing past the window as I approach Baoding on the high-speed train from Beijing. Even when driving around the city, it\u2019s not immediately obvious what causes the pollution. The outskirts are home to one coal power plant that doesn\u2019t appear to be in use, with no sign of workers and not a wisp of smoke from the big chimneys. Like an increasing number of plants in the province, it may well have been closed down as part of increased governmental anti-pollution measures.    It was much better when I was young \u2013 the air was very clean. We rarely see blue skies now  Mr Han        \u2018There is smog on most days\u2019: Mr Han, 66, has lived in Baoding his whole life. Photograph: Jennifer Duggan    Yet, on a bad day, Baoding\u2019s pollution levels can rise beyond 300 on the air quality index, which is classed as hazardous for human health. On these days, the smog clings to the city like a thick grey shroud, and its residents are ghost-like shadows moving through the haze. Visibility for driving is reduced and headlights and traffic lights glow eerily, barely visible. Air is not something you can normally taste but, on high-pollution days, there is a metallic tang that catches in the back of your throat. Despite this, many of Baoding\u2019s residents appear hesitant to discuss the city\u2019s new status as China\u2019s most polluted city, and when they do, are often defensive of it. \u201cIt\u2019s OK in Baoding,\u201d Mr Zhu tells me, pointing to today\u2019s unusually clear skies. He is manning a food stand outside a small restaurant; over a hot stove, he prepares thick savoury pancakes filled with vegetables. Zhu says that his version of this popular snack food is the best in the city \u2013 and although he spends hours outside every day, he is not worried about the pollution, asserting his faith that the central government is doing something to improve the situation. According to official figures, on the day I visit Baoding\u2019s air quality is \u201cgood\u201d , despite the fact that the level of PM2.5 particles \u2013 considered dangerous because they lodge deep in the lungs \u2013 is at 54 micrograms per cubic metre, more than double the maximum daily levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. Baoding is located in the north-eastern province of Hebei, China\u2019s pollution \u201cground zero\u201d which is home to seven of the 10 cities that are ranked worst in the country for air pollution. Surrounding Beijing and with its industries centred in coal and steel, Hebei gets the blame for many of the Chinese capital\u2019s headline-grabbing \u201cairpocalypses\u201d.     March 2014: a man looks on as a bulldozer piles up garbage to burn on the outskirts of Baoding. Photograph: China Stringer Network/Reuters    Pollution has become a controversial topic in China in recent months. In March, a hard-hitting documentary, Under the Dome, outlining the gravity of the country\u2019s air pollution problem \u2013 which is estimated to cause the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands of people each year \u2013 went viral online.  The hour-long film, directed by journalist Chai Jing, has been compared to Al Gore\u2019s 2006 film on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth, and was viewed online more than 200 million times before being censored and removed. Duan Chao, a doctor at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Baoding, confirms that he sees more patients during bouts of smog. \u201cMore people come when the air is not good,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are more patients with breathing difficulties, people with coughs.\u201d A traditional medicine called ban lan gen is used to treat respiratory illnesses when the smog is bad.      Solar panels on street lights in Baoding. Photograph: Jennifer Duggan    Duan says that awareness is rising in Baoding about air pollution. He takes a mask out of his pocket that he carries with him at all times. While a number of people are spotted wearing face masks, they are generally flimsy and loose fitting, or are surgical masks, which offer little or no protection against most pollutants. In main cities like Beijing and Shanghai, specialist face masks are widely on sale and many homes have air purifiers \u2013 but in Baoding, none of the people I interviewed had one at home. The great irony here is that, in 2010, Baoding was named as a pilot of China\u2019s new project to introduce low-carbon zones: an ambitious plan to use renewable energies to illuminate streets and heat residential buildings. As a result, the city has become a hub for renewable energy companies, including Yingli Solar, one of the world\u2019s largest photovoltaic manufacturers.  Yingli is based in a massive industrial park less than 20 minutes drive from downtown Baoding. The complex seems to go on for miles, with solar panels lining the streets. A new building is under construction with walls made from solar panels; its slogan repeats Yingli\u2019s mission to provide pollution-improving, affordable solar energy for all.  At Yingli, Ma Hongha, dressed in blue overalls, heads to start her shift with two of her colleagues. \u201cMany people in Baoding work in this industry,\u201d Ma says, adding that it is important for the city\u2019s economy. She is reluctant to discuss the pollution, but acknowledges it has got worse since she was a child. But, she adds, \u201cBaoding is improving. More solar panels will mean the world will be cleaner.\u201d The industrial area is also home to a number of manufacturers of blades for wind turbines, including Zhong Hang Huiteng Wind Power, one of the largest blade makers in the world. On the edge of the industrial park, turbine blades almost the length of a football pitch are loaded on to flatbed trucks for transportation. In total, around 170 companies related to renewable energy are located in Baoding. Yet still the mystery of the city\u2019s pollution was unclear to me. The city doesn\u2019t have a high concentration of industrial plants around it; there are a lot of cars on the roads and car dealerships are plentiful, but that couldn\u2019t account for the high levels of pollution. Local residents didn\u2019t seem to know, either, or were reluctant to discuss it, though some blamed the weather and pollution from neighbouring cities.    The great irony is that, in 2010, Baoding was named \u200bas \u200ba pilot of China\u2019s project to introduce low-carbon \u200bzones          A wind turbine blade is loaded on to a flatbed truck. Photograph: Jennifer Duggan    It was only when I came across local news reports that the cause of the city\u2019s pollution became clearer. According to preliminary findings of an analysis carried out across Hebei, much of Baoding\u2019s pollution comes from coal-fired steam boiler systems used in more than 100 provincial villages close to the city. These boilers are extremely polluting. Tackling air pollution has become a national priority and, last year, premier Li Keqiang declared \u201cwar\u201d on pollution. With its economy still largely reliant on coal-fired industries such as steel and cement, Hebei province is an important battleground in that war \u2013 with its authorities faced with the difficult task of balancing economic growth and environmental welfare. Already some parts of Hebei are feeling the impact as plants are closed in an attempt to improve the smog in Beijing. The city\u2019s Communist Party chief, Nie Ruiping, was quoted as saying: \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to close some traditional factories to fight air pollution. We cannot sacrifice the environment to make money.\u201d By harnessing the energy of its new industries, perhaps Baoding will not keep its unwanted new title for long.

Hollywood stars, politicians, royalty, gangsters and other denizens of the demi-monde \u2013 hedonists and hucksters, harlots and heroes \u2013 flicker through a well-paced narrative, illuminating a page or two and seldom outstaying their welcome. Von Mumm is a bit-part player among the cast of hundreds, lasting just long enough to pilot the German four-man bob at Lake Placid in 1932, with a scratch crew including the German consul in New York, a Swiss gentleman later jailed in his own country for helping the Nazis and a member of the Bismarck family. The story\u2019s central figure is Billy Fiske, to whom we are introduced in the prologue as his shot-up Hawker Hurricane, its undercarriage still retracted, slides to a smoking halt on a\u00a0West Sussex airfield, its badly burnt pilot slumped over the controls. At 29, Pilot Officer Fiske of the RAF\u2019s 601 Squadron is much older than most of\u00a0the men attempting to repulse the\u00a0Luftwaffe\u2019s raids on Britain in the\u00a0summer of 1940, and has already experienced enough adventure to fill several lifetimes. The handsome and charismatic son of a New York banker, Fiske lived in France with his family before being sent to boarding school in England. A\u00a0trip to St Moritz in 1927 introduced him to the joys of sliding down icy tracks, and the following year, aged 16, he won his first Olympic title in what was then the five-man bob (he would remain the youngest winner of a gold medal in the Winter Games until the honour was taken in 1992 by a Finnish ski jumper, his junior by a single day). Then came Cambridge, where he studied economics and history and raced his supercharged Bentley around the country lanes before returning to the US to join the investment bank for which his father worked. Andy Bull, who will be well known to the readers of this paper\u2019s sports pages, is in the business of separating the truth from the myths, and he can find no hard evidence for the story about Fiske having raced a Stutz Bearcat at Le Mans. It hardly matters as\u00a0Fiske sets off on a world tour including a Gauguin-like idyll in Tahiti,\u00a0golf with his pal Douglas Fairbanks Jr in the Chinese amateur championship, and a hurried departure\u00a0from Shanghai following an\u00a0affair with a diplomat\u2019s wife. Back home in the States, he helps found the winter sports resort at Aspen in the Colorado Rockies. He also launches his\u00a0own film production company with\u00a0another pal, the Italian big-game hunter and Davis Cup tennis player Count Alfredo Carpegna; his adventures in Hollywood include a\u00a0liaison with the actor Alice Faye, the co-respondent in the crooner Rudy Vallee\u2019s divorce. He captains the bobsleigh team for a\u00a0second time at the 1932 Winter Games, an encore that \u2013 including the troubled birth of the resort at Lake Placid \u2013 forms the focal point of the story. Now the crews consist of four men rather than five, and the primitive and undignified technique of ventre \u00e0\u00a0terre, in which they lie face-down on top of each other, has been replaced by the more decorous and comfortable seating in line astern. And his team-mates are hardly less colourful than their leader. Eddie Eagan, born into a poor Irish-American family in Denver, had gone on not only to study at Yale and Harvard but to become the amateur heavyweight boxing champion of the US and the UK \u2013 the latter title won during his time as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where he encountered Harold Acton and dined with the Prince of Wales. In 1918, aged 20, he had fought Jack Dempsey; two years later he won the Olympic title in Antwerp. The bobsleigh success in 1932 would make him the only man to win gold medals in both summer and winter Games, a feat that remains unmatched.

His playgrounds were Monte Carlo and Deauville and his wives included the dancer Mae Murray, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, whose affections he had won in a battle with the young Rudolph Valentino; and the actor Irene Fenwick, whom he lost to Lionel Barrymore. O\u2019Brien would die in 1940, aged 57, of a heart attack after a\u00a0day at his Florida home in the company of Joseph Kennedy, who had recently resigned his post as ambassador to the Court of St James\u2019s. The author dispels the confusion over the fourth man, Clifford Gray, a failed composer and playboy. He was long assumed to have been Clifford Grey, an\u00a0English songwriter and entertainer whose successes included \u201cIf You Were the Only Girl in the World\u201d and who died in 1941. The mix-up extended as\u00a0far as the engraving on Grey\u2019s tombstone in Ipswich, which includes an erroneous mention of his supposed triumph at Lake Placid.

After a short board meeting we cut their wages, assured they would survive and that, with a bit of cajoling, they would return to our sweatshop in Shenzhen after their two-week break. But that was only the start. In Zoe Svendsen\u2019s play World Factory at the Young Vic, the audience becomes the cast. Sixteen teams sit around factory desks playing out a carefully constructed game that requires you to run a clothing factory in China. How to deal with a troublemaker? How to dupe the buyers from ethical retail brands? What to do about the ever-present problem of clients that do not pay? Because the choices are binary they are rarely palatable. But what shocked me \u2013 and has surprised the theatre \u2013 is the capacity of perfectly decent, liberal hipsters on London\u2019s south bank to become ruthless capitalists when seated at the boardroom table. The classic problem presented by the game is one all managers face: short-term issues, usually involving cashflow, versus the long-term challenge of nurturing your workforce and your client base. Despite the fact that a public-address system was blaring out, in English and Chinese, that \u201cyour workforce is your vital asset\u201d our assembled young professionals repeatedly had to be cajoled not to treat them like dirt.   Related: World Factory review \u2013 interactive play smartly unravels fashion industry    And because the theatre captures data on every choice by every team, for every performance, I know we were not alone. The aggregated flowchart reveals that every audience, on every night, veers towards money and away from ethics. Svendsen says: \u201cMost people who were given the choice to raise wages \u2013 having cut them \u2013 did not. There is a route in the decision-tree that will only get played if people pursue a particularly ethical response, but very few people end up there. What we\u2019ve realised is that it is not just the profit motive but also prudence, the need to survive at all costs, that pushes people in the game to go down more capitalist routes.\u201d In short, many people have no idea what running a business actually means in the 21st century. Yes, suppliers \u2013 from East Anglia to Shanghai \u2013 will try to break your ethical codes; but most of those giant firms\u2019 commitment to good practice, and environmental sustainability, is real. And yes, the money is all important. But real businesses will take losses, go into debt and pay workers to stay idle in order to maintain the long-term relationships vital in a globalised economy. Why do so many decent people, when asked to pretend they\u2019re CEOs, become tyrants from central casting? Part of the answer is: capitalism subjects us to economic rationality. It forces us to see ourselves as cashflow generators, profit centres or interest-bearing assets. But that idea is always in conflict with something else: the non-economic priorities of human beings, and the need to sustain the environment. Though World Factory, as a play, is designed to show us the parallels between 19th-century Manchester and 21st-century China, it subtly illustrates what has changed.     A worker in a Chinese clothing factory Photograph: Imaginechina/Corbis    A real Chinese sweatshop owner is playing a losing game against something much more sophisticated than the computer at the Young Vic: an intelligent machine made up of the smartphones of millions of migrant workers on their lunchbreak, plugging digitally into their village networks to find out wages and conditions elsewhere. That sweatshop owner is also playing against clients with an army of compliance officers, themselves routinely harassed by NGOs with secret cameras. The whole purpose of this system of regulation \u2013 from above and below \u2013 is to prevent individual capitalists making short-term decisions that destroy the human and natural resources it needs to function. Capitalism is not just the selfish decisions of millions of people. It is those decisions sifted first through the all-important filter of regulation. It is, as late 20th-century social theorists understood, a mode of regulation, not just of production. Yet it plays on us a cruel ideological trick. It looks like a spontaneous organism, to which government and regulation (and the desire of Chinese migrants to visit their families once a year) are mere irritants. In reality it needs the state to create and re-create it every day. Banks create money because the state awards them the right to. Why does the state ram-raid the homes of small-time drug dealers, yet call in the CEOs of the banks whose employees commit multimillion-pound frauds for a stern ticking off over a tray of Waitrose sandwiches? Answer: because a company has limited liability status, created by parliament in 1855 after a political struggle.   Related: Chinese factory activity slumps to lowest for a year as demand slows    Our fascination with market forces blinds us to the fact that capitalism \u2013 as a state of being \u2013 is a set of conditions created and maintained by states. Today it is beset by strategic problems: debt- ridden, with sub-par growth and low productivity, it cannot unleash the true potential of the info-tech revolution because it cannot imagine what to do with the millions who would lose their jobs. The computer that runs the data system in Svendsen\u2019s play could easily run a robotic clothes factory. That\u2019s the paradox. But to make a third industrial revolution happen needs something no individual factory boss can execute: the re-regulation of capitalism into something better. Maybe the next theatre game about work and exploitation should model the decisions of governments, lobbyists and judges, not the hapless managers. Paul Mason is economics editor of Channel 4 News.

Many of the Portuguese- and Dutch-era buildings have been restored and renovated, but one of my favourites is the Galle Fort Hotel.  Restored to its former glory, the hotel is one of the pricier places to stay in town (up to $320 a night in peak season) \u2013 but you can soak up the vibe simply by having a G&amp;T in the hotel\u2019s bar, which is a pleasant porch area out the front where you can sit amid the tropical blossoms and watch the street life pass by. Cafe Batavia and Hermitage Hotel, Jakarta, Indonesia Colonial Jakarta is a crumbly mess: beautiful old buildings with white cracked paint and trees growing out the windows; boarded-up windows and creaky narrow staircases where ravens now nest. It\u2019s as if the city doesn\u2019t have the heart to tear down the old buildings but lacks the money to restore them.  There is one notable exception \u2013 Cafe Batavia. Originally built circa 1805-1850 as administration offices before becoming an art gallery in 1990, an Australian, Graham James, bought it in 1991 and reopened it as Cafe Batavia in 1993. There are black and white pictures all over the walls, an old piano and historical trinkets. The food is a pricey by Indonesian standards but the atmosphere is like stepping back in time.  If you want to stay at a heritage hotel in Jakarta, then the Hermitage Hotel is a welcome change from many of the capital\u2019s gleaming chain hotels. Situated in the historical district of Menteng, in central Jakarta, the hotel is in an art deco building from 1923 that was once a Dutch Telecommunications office.     Cafe Batavia in Jakarta.

When her trailer is full, she takes the load to a recycling market on the outskirts of the city where she sells each pile for a 1p profit.

Shanghai, a city of around 24 million people, currently produces 22,000 tons of rubbish a day and the city is running out of landfill space. Liwen says that more and more waste is being generated and an increasing amount of materials that could be recycled are ending up in landfill.  Workers like Guan and Jinling ensure not all materials end up in landfill, but price fluctuations can make the informal recycling unpredictable. If it becomes less profitable for waste pickers to collect and sell a particular material, it\u2019s unlikely to be recycled. For example, the price waste pickers get for glass bottles has recently fallen, so without an incentive of profit, glass is increasingly ending up in landfill.  Because of falling prices, the numbers of waste pickers are starting to dwindle. Guan says: \u201cThe price is going down and more people are going to work in factory and construction work.\u201d   Related: Waste not: Egypt's refuse collectors regain role at heart of Cairo society    Government involvement As China\u2019s levels of rubbish grows, the government has looked to incineration. . According to local news reports, four new incineration plants are to be opened in Shanghai and city officials estimate that by 2016, 70% of the city\u2019s household waste will be incinerated. However, incineration is becoming controversial among the public in China due to environmental concerns and there have been protests against proposed plants. In April, plans for an incinerator in Guangdong province in southern China were scrapped by the local authorities after a mass protest.  Environmental campaigners also say that incineration doesn\u2019t deal with the root causes of China\u2019s waste problem. \u201cBecause you are building more and more incinerators people don\u2019t care about waste, they just throw away,\u201d says Liwen.  The government in Shanghai and other cities have made some efforts to introduce centralised recycling systems. Last year, Shanghai set a rubbish sorting target of 95% as part of a three year initiative. But despite efforts public awareness of recycling and waste reduction remains low.  Liwen says that the informal recycling system is so widespread and efficient that instead of trying to get rid of it or replace it the government should work with it to improve recycling levels. \u201cI don\u2019t think they should destroy the current informal recycling system. What they need to do is to give them more space, to give them support because the current system is very good,\u201d she said.  This article was amended on 28 May 2015.

For all sorts of reasons, this strikes at the core of being a human being. It\u2019s so compelling \u2026 this is as big an opportunity as the internet.\u201d He\u2019s talking about virtual reality (VR), the immersive systems that cover your eyes (and ideally ears) and fool your brain into thinking you\u2019re somewhere, or even someone, else. Waldern, 54, is a veteran of the business: in the 90s, his company Virtuality was a pioneer in commercial VR, offering an arcade game experience in which a bulky headset transformed the room into a prehistoric scene in which pterodactyls swooped over and around you, and you tried to shoot them with your gun. The last time I saw Waldern was in the UK, more than 20 years ago. Virtuality, which he had brought to the London stock market, was in talks with Atari to bring its ambitious Jaguar headset to consumers. But the deal fell apart, and then so did Virtuality. The market for VR shrank to zero almost overnight; its speed and completeness foreshadowed the dot-com boom and bust of 2000-2001. But, just as the dot-coms evolved and returned like mammals emerging from a meteor strike, VR has come back too. And that\u2019s what Waldern, who now runs a Silicon Valley company called Digilens, is excited about. He sees the field enjoying a resurgence, its long hibernation is over. And survivors like him are emerging to capitalise on the new boom.      Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show, Shanghai. Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cIt\u2019s a very small community [in VR] around here,\u201d Waldern continues, referring to the west coast. (Though it transpires that when he says \u201csmall\u201d, he means \u201cin the thousands, but geographically close\u201d.) \u201cThe cost of development in this realm is so high that very few corporations would take it on. Only the big three \u2013 Microsoft, Google, Facebook. Apple is the fourth, but isn\u2019t so prominent.\u201d Does that mean Apple is looking at VR too? \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly comment,\u201d says Waldern, and grins. (Apple filed a patent in September 2008 for putting an iPhone into a headset, and another in 2014, but there\u2019s been little other sign of activity on that front from the company.) Even if it isn\u2019t, the presence of the other three big companies in this space shows how hot VR has suddenly become. Oculus Rift, bought by Facebook for $2bn in March 2014, has been the poster child for the new face of this technology; the company now aims to launch a headset for consumers in 2016. It will have challengers though. Sony is working on Project Morpheus, which has the same aim, and HTC has built Vive, unveiled at Mobile World Congress in March, which will work with the Valve system for downloadable games. Samsung has its own Gear VR, developed with Oculus. Even Google\u2019s Cardboard, a DIY system which you literally fold together from a cardboard template before sticking your smartphone into a slot a few inches from your eyes, has had around 1.2m downloads since Google introduced it at its I/O developer conference in May 2014.  Meanwhile the parallel development of \u201caugmented reality\u201d (where objects and data are overlaid on to the scene you see in front of you) is growing quickly, too, with Microsoft\u2019s Hololens the most promising offering to date, along with Google-funded Magic Leap. (Google Glass, which is undergoing a rethink, is like a subset of AR.) But it\u2019s VR that has everyone excited. In March 2014, Chris Dixon, a partner at the increasingly influential venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, observed that using an early version of Oculus Rift the year before was one of \u201ca handful of technology demos in my life that made me feel like I was glimpsing into the future\u201d \u2013 and his list ran back as far as the Apple II computer from the 70s.  VR, he noted, \u201chas long been a staple of science fiction\u201d (of which Star Trek: the Next Generation\u2019s \u201cholodeck\u201d was only the most recent) but hardware was now cheap enough, and engineers keen enough to explore a new frontier, that it could finally deliver on the science fiction promise. (Dixon\u2019s team cashed out on Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Oculus Rift.)         Virtuality promo film    In the 90s, VR certainly felt like SF. Waldern\u2019s company relied on top-end Silicon Graphics systems with six-figure price tags. There\u2019s a video of him from 1994 at W Industries, showing how pixellated the experience was. \u201cOur system used some of the very first Sony LCDs, with 300 by 200 pixels,\u201d Waldern recalls. \u201cToday you get 1,080p [1,080 horizontal lines] minimum, and by the launch next year you\u2019ll probably have 4K by 4K. And the computational power is transformational \u2013 we were working on about a megaflop, and each machine cost about $70,000, which is a massive barrier to adoption. Now with an Nvidia GPU you\u2019re talking about a teraflop.\u201d VR is a complex real-time computing problem. Ideally, the fictional scene should show no individual pixels, fill your field of view \u2013 which in normally sighted people covers 180 degrees \u2013 and change without any lag, no matter how quickly you move your head. That means the system has to be able to calculate what the scene will look like at any point, and incorporate the movement of your head, reported from the helmet, into its computation, and update the screens quickly enough to give the sensation of realistic movement. Measurement of head movement is done using accelerometers and gyroscopes; the screens can now offer millions of pixels just inches from your eyes; computing power aims to cut lag and latency. The latter can quickly induce nausea if the scene isn\u2019t redrawn quickly enough as the body\u2019s balance system disagrees with what the eyes tell it they\u2019re seeing; that was a key problem with early VR systems. But those are being overcome, thanks to the rapid growth of the smartphone industry. That has made accelerometers and gyroscopic chips cheap, plentiful and fast, while also pushing the quality of displays to a level where you can\u2019t distinguish pixels even in screens a few inches from your eyes. That though requires graphics processors that can handle huge numbers of floating point operations per second (flops) \u2013 but, as Waldern says, that\u2019s available. Among those eagerly exploiting that space is Professor Bob Stone, chair of interactive multimedia systems at the University of Birmingham, and another British veteran of the 1990s boom and bust. After another 20-year gap, I caught up with him as he travelled from a location where he had been using a drone to create a 3D \u201cpoint cloud\u201d of a church and archaeological dig in Wiltshire; in just five minutes of flight it captured enough data to create a realistic 3D model that one could \u201cfly\u201d through at leisure.     Image, \u2018point cloud\u2019 and reconstructed image captured by drone for virtual reality overview of archaeological dig by Prof Bob Stone. Photograph: Dropbox    When we spoke, Stone initially seemed unimpressed by Oculus\u2019s offering, suggesting that \u201cit\u2019s not much different from the headsets of the late 1990s\u201d. He cited \u201cpixel bleed\u201d (where the pixels don\u2019t appear sharp) and limits on the field of view. \u201cWe\u2019re using Oculus Rift development kit 2 [the latest version] in defence projects, because it\u2019s the best of a bad bunch,\u201d he said. Why bad? Stone feels that if you have to wear something, \u201cyou aren\u2019t really experiencing total immersion\u201d; he thinks ideally VR should simply feel like life. \u201cMore than 20 years on, shouldn\u2019t we be further ahead than this?\u201d he asks. But later he emails, relenting on his apparent negativity: \u201cVR has been my career for over 28 years now, and I genuinely believe in what VR can deliver when the technologies are applied appropriately and with the needs of the end users and end organisations well and truly in mind. As I said, it seems that every seven years we see the same old issues and hype coming through (these days via the web, YouTube, etc) that people out there seem to believe without question!\u201d The original bust in VR came when first-generation products were crushed by the weight of expectations. So what led to the renaissance of VR \u2013 and why has it taken so long? Waldern reckons a key reason is that games, which were the main consumer-facing use for VR, shifted to a different set of genres. \u201cThere are periodic cycles in the games industry, for technologies and genres. People want change from time to time.\u201d After a couple of decades of 2D and pseudo-3D offerings (think of Nintendo\u2019s games, and Quake and Doom), gamers are ready for an \u201cimmersive\u201d experience, he argues.  Digilens\u2019s work involves building optical waveguides, so that projected images can fill or overlay the field of vision. Most of the uses on the company site involve business, rather than consumer, application, but Waldern sees all sorts of potential. \u201cWhy do you think Microsoft bought Minecraft?\u201d he asks. \u201cHololens is perfect for it.\u201d   Related: Touchy subject: a breakthrough for gaming and virtual reality    Stone agrees: \u201cOne thing that saved VR was that while we were running around talking about headsets and gloves, the gaming community was coming up underneath, and came up with software and hardware in the quest for the best quality games. That drove down the cost of computing with graphics, and also made available a number of toolkits for games-quality virtual worlds that people could sympathise with.\u201d Games drove costs down: \u201cThings that in the late 1990s cost six-figure sums you can now do on an \u00a3800 laptop.\u201d Brian Blau, research director at analysis company Gartner, forecast in March \u2013 before Oculus\u2019s announcement of a tentative release date \u2013 that there would be 2m VR headsets sold in 2016, rising to 8m in 2018; in all he thinks there could be 25m in use within a few years. That doesn\u2019t sound quite like the gigantic opportunity that Waldern described. But VR is seeing a growing number of uses in commercial spaces, where the ability to train people, or give them a new perspective, is valuable.    Related: Virtual reality offers NBA and NFL fans a more immersive experience    But it\u2019s not the military, or even games, which might be the most effective users of VR. One can imagine scores of scenarios where it would be transformative. Planning your next holiday? Why not \u201cvisit\u201d the alternatives first, via a headset? Games, exploration, psychiatry and many other fields could all be revolutionised. \u201cSex, of course,\u201d says Stone. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some crazy devices coming out of Japan.\u201d He points to healthcare, education and training as other fields that are most likely to take it up quickly. Facebook\u2019s purchase of Oculus, though, suggests that it sees the capability to transform how we interact with friends \u2013 which is what Waldern is thinking of when he talks about it potentially being bigger than the internet. \u201cEven back at the start, the biggest kick we got was when we used ISDN lines between Berlin and London, and we linked players up in a game. It was amazing: you could meet, play, talk with people. Now, games have been doing that virtually for a while. But when you can feel you\u2019re really meeting someone, right there, as a jolly alien or Robin Hood \u2026\u201d He stretches for the words. \u201cImmersivity is the main thing. This has many years to run, and we have to get to where we are totally convinced \u2013 but we\u2019re looking at something which has transformational capability for society.\u201d ", "tags": ["Technology", "Virtual reality", "Facebook", "World news", "Silicon Valley", "Education", "Academic experts"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-28T06:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/28/hong-kong-hsbc-hq-bank-history-cities-50-buildings", "sentences": ["When the board of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation came together in the mid-1970s to formulate plans for their new headquarters, the symbolic political power of their building was similarly at the forefront of their minds."], "title": "Norman Foster's Hong Kong HSBC headquarters tore up the rule book \u2013 a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 45", "article": "Banks don\u2019t very often play a starring role in protests, unless they are providing the windows to be smashed, the Mammonic effigies to be burned, or the slick corporate infrastructure from which banners may be strung. Which makes the headquarters of HSBC Bank in Hong Kong, Norman Foster\u2019s \u00a3700m oil rig of colonial capital, an unusual case. For a year from 15 October 2011, the sloping granite plaza beneath the tower\u2019s bulging glass belly sheltered the ad hoc tent-and-cardboard city of the Occupy movement. The protesters were fighting not against the tyranny of capitalism, but to preserve some of the very values that this imperial bastion represents: namely democratic rule, threatened by the coming transfer of power to the Chinese state. When the board of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation came together in the mid-1970s to formulate plans for their new headquarters, the symbolic political power of their building was similarly at the forefront of their minds. In the run-up to the 1997 handover of sovereignty to China, which was beginning to cause alarm amongst the more panicky of the island\u2019s residents, the bank was keen to plant a conspicuous stake in the future of the territory. Whatever Chinese communist rule would bring, HSBC\u2019s new building had to be designed to show that capitalism would have a prominent role. It must be a beacon of reassurance, proving that there was no justification for the flight of either people or capital from the fragrant harbour.     When it was completed in 1986, the HSBC HQ was the most expensive building in the world. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    Until that point, major investments in private physical infrastructure had not been considered a priority in Hong Kong. It had always been seen as a high-octane pleasure island, a place to make as much money as quickly as possible, while keeping a keen eye on the escape route. But the coming handover provided the pressure for architectural ambitions to be crystallised. HSBC, which was practically an arm of government, issuing currency notes and shaping economic policy, decided they needed \u201cthe best bank building in the world\u201d \u2013 an office tower that would have to be the highest quality both in name and reality for at least the next 50 years. By the time it was completed in 1986, it would be the most expensive building in the world. Its astronomical bill (equivalent to \u00a31.8bn at today\u2019s prices) came down to Foster\u2019s total approach to the project: every part of what an office building should be was to be fundamentally rethought from scratch. To make this building, the wheel had to be reinvented many times over: because in Foster\u2019s world, there is always a better wheel to be made. Office buildings don\u2019t very often rewrite the way in which cities are built, but the HSBC building, both Foster\u2019s first major project outside the UK and his first tower, tore up the rule book and influenced how commercial blocks and entire financial centres have been made ever since. It took the 1960s dream of a plug-in, prefab city and made it real, as well as reinventing the slab of stacked floor-plates as a series of vertical neighbourhoods, and it showed how a corporate monument of this scale could actually give something back to the city at street level.     Protesters move a tent during the \u201cOccupy Central\u201d campaign, which began in October 2011. Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters    Much of the drive for innovation came down to speed. The need to build in over a million square feet of office space in a short amount of time pointed towards a high degree of prefabrication, leading the project conceived as a city-sized Meccano set. Like Richard Rogers\u2019 Lloyds building \u2013 which was completed the same year, making these buildings and their architects the twin titans of the High Tech movement \u2013 it embodied the contemporary dream of factory-floor mass production, which in reality necessitated levels of bespoke manufacture and highly skilled craftsmanship worthy of a medieval cathedral. It was to be a global assembly line, an international kit of parts that included 30,000 tonnes of steel modules made by ship-builders in Glasgow, along with service pods from Japan, lightweight movable flooring panels from America, as well as components from Holland, Germany and Italy, all assembled in Hong Kong like a vertical jumbo jet, with a degree of precision never before attempted in a building. The aluminium cladding system alone required 10,000 drawings to be made. As Foster wrote at the time: \u201cThe sheer visual delight of the cladding details on the bank could not have happened without a shared endeavour, enthusiasm and dedication which extended from a factory in Missouri, through to a Chinese workforce on site, and a highly mobile design team who were as much at home on the shop floor as on the drawing board. It is as much about aesthetics as water penetration and tolerances, but it is not about the architect as a remote aesthete removed from the production process.\u201d     The building\u2019s escalators apparently symbolise the whiskers of a dragon sucking wealth into its belly. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    The kind of structure was as revolutionary as the method of construction, having more in common with building a bridge than a conventional office block. In order to liberate the banking floors from the usual grid of structural columns and provide flexibility for future changes, the structure and servicing was banished to the edges of the plan, with groups of floors suspended from great coat-hanger trusses, dramatically slung between steel masts at either end of the building. All of these structural gymnastics are expressed on the facade, along with racks of solar shading louvres and typhoon bracing for the windows, giving the tower the look of a gleaming off-shore rig, a machine for drilling wealth from the bedrock beneath Central Hong Kong, a refinery built on opium and imperialism. Inside, this hefty exoskeleton allowed for a revolutionary organisation of staff. Clusters of floors were organised in five \u201csocial villages\u201d, separated by double-height communal floors where the trusses leap across the facade. Banks of high-speed elevators shuttle employees to these five levels, from where the individual office floors are accessed by a zig-zagging series of escalators, turning the circulation into a theatrical and sociable promenade. The suspension structure also had implications at ground level, allowing the entire building to be jacked up on steel legs to free the area beneath for the public plaza. It was a significant gesture in high-density Hong Kong and it continues to be a well-used public space space, taking on a welcome lease of life as a sheltered carpet for pick-nicking Filipino maids at the weekend, who take advantage of the air-conditioning leaking out of the bulging glass ceiling above. From here, two of what still purport to be the longest freely supported escalators in the world sweep up at odd angles for feng shui reasons \u2013 they apparently symbolise the whiskers of a dragon sucking wealth into its belly. They also serve to whisk visitors up into a 10-storey atrium, where a faceted glazed vault appears to funnel light down from above, belying the fact that there are in fact 25 storeys of offices stacked above this glass ceiling. The trick? It\u2019s all done with mirrors. An early example of the nascent gadget fetish of the period, which led to a dysfunctional slew of computer-controlled building systems that have plagued the world\u2019s caretakers ever since, the building employed a revolutionary mechanical \u201csunscoop\u201d. A bank of mirrors projects out on the south-facing facade at 12th-floor level, like an oversized gutter, programmed to follow the position of the sun throughout the day and reflect the light back onto a curving mirrored ceiling at the top of the atrium. Thirty years on, it\u2019s not really working out as planned: all the office lights are generally switched on in the middle of the day.   Related: New York's twin towers \u2013 the 'filing cabinets' that became icons of America: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 40    But, in other ways, the structure has remained true to its flexible dream. Floors have been reconfigured over the years and a large dealers\u2019 room has been incorporated on one level, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible with a more conventional structure. Feng shui has returned too. Although the entire building was originally designed in collaboration with a trained feng shui geomancer, they could not have anticipated the arrival of IM Pei\u2019s Bank of China building next door in 1990. The sharp corners of its faceted flanks can apparently be seen to represent knife edges, wilfully slashing away at the good fortune of its neighbours. Was it a coincidence that, in this bastion of Chinese might, one knife edge pointed towards British Government House, while the other jabbed in the direction of the HSBC building? And that, shortly after it was completed, the Governor died and there was a sharp downturn in HSBC\u2019s fiscal fortunes? Better safe than sorry, advised HSBC\u2019s feng shui masters, who promptly saw to it that two cannon-shaped protrusions were installed on the roof, pointing directly back at the Bank of China. They look more like window-cleaning gantries to me, but on an island where apartment buildings have holes cut through the middle to allow dragons to reach the water, it\u2019s somehow appropriate for the architecture to acknowledge the invisible forces of financial and diplomatic warfare being waged across these streets.

Lan Hai International Golf Club boasts two 18-hole courses. But the place is not strictly for golfers. It\u2019s a preserve of those who have profited the most from China\u2019s economic boom. Any given Saturday morning, you\u2019ll find the elite gliding from hole to hole in their electric golf carts, the players accompanied by two caddies alert to their every command and quick to advise on how to play the course. The game invariably winds up at the clubhouse, its entrance flanked by two superb Italian fountains. For these golfers, the drive from Shanghai is no obstacle; they come and go in powerful sedans. Some even own one of the Tuscan-style villas that rim the links. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle,\u201d says the club\u2019s manager, Zhang Hongze. He\u2019s convinced Chongming will soon become what Long Island is to New York. His reception room boasts a fireplace right out of a French chateau. This lifestyle, however, is now being targeted by China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and his powerful ally Wang Qishan, the country\u2019s anti-corruption boss. Mao Zedong once denounced golf as a bourgeois pastime, and since Xi took office in 2012, the president has led a campaign against excesses by state officials and their friends in business. To dodge the purge, many now avoid displays of conspicuous consumption, even if they got rich the legal way and even if to them golf is merely a means to network with the powerful. Communist party leaders want to show they\u2019re still close to the common people, and if there\u2019s one glaring symbol of wealth in China, it\u2019s golf. Unlike the US, Japan and Korea, where golf is a sport of the leisured middle class, in China high membership fees, equipment costs and associated expenditures make it very much a privilege of the rich. Inevitably, the political storm now sweeping China has hit the golf courses of the nation and the players who use\u00a0them. In April, five months after submitting to an official government inspection, China Southern Airlines \u2013 Asia\u2019s largest carrier by fleet size and passengers carried \u2013 announced it would no longer offer free golf holidays to its most loyal customers. And last December, the province of Guangdong ordered its officials to steer clear of the fairways, too. The sport is getting a bad reputation in other ways. To be maintained properly, golf courses have to be watered regularly \u2013 this, at a time when northern China is suffering from chronic water shortages. And building new ones means expropriating farmland, often under highly dubious circumstances \u2013 this at a time when the most heavily populated country on the planet strives daily to\u00a0maintain enough arable land to feed its people. In March, China\u2019s national development and reform commission, the state\u2019s central planning office, announced the closure of 66 golf clubs \u2013 about one out of every 10 in the country, according to American journalist Dan Washburn, author of The Forbidden Game: Golf and the Chinese Dream . That\u2019s a rough estimate, he admits: \u201cNobody knows the exact number of golf clubs in China \u2013 it\u2019s somewhere between 600 and 1,000.\u201d The Chinese government ordered a stop to new construction in 2004, but the number of clubs has tripled since then in other guises, lumped in with acceptable projects such as protected nature reserves.    What makes it attractive to the nouveau riche is that feeling of belonging to a select group, far from the madding crowd    Golf not only draws the keen eye of many a local politician, but the opening of a new club can bring prestige to the commune that runs it. Municipalities compete with each other to attract investors, and there\u2019s a strong financial incentive: promoters pay high prices for land expropriated by local governments, who have owned it since Mao collectivised farms in the 1950s. As a result, the People\u2019s Republic is now home to the two biggest golf clubs in the world: Mission Hills Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong, which features seven 18-hole resort and championship courses, and Mission Hills Haikou, still under construction on the tropical island of Hainan and which will have 22 golf courses on offer. New clubs have opened in even more exotic locations: for example, in Hunan province\u2019s Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, whose mountains inspired the ones seen in the sci-fi movie Avatar. At Lan Hai, China\u2019s anti-corruption campaign is a sensitive subject. The club opened in June 2012, just before Xi came to power. \u201cFor two or three years now, our sport has attracted a great deal of attention,\u201d club manager Zhang acknowledges, trying to accentuate the positive. \u201cIf there have been illegal practices and people have been punished, that\u2019s progress.\u201d But officials who once made a habit of playing 18 holes at Lan Hai now keep a low profile. The way things are in China these days, if golf is to have a future it must become more democratic. Trouble is, what makes it attractive to the nouveau riche is that very feeling of belonging to a select group, far from the madding crowd. \u201cA lot of people pick up golf precisely because they want to become a member of an exclusive club,\u201d says Washburn. With its cigar lounge, whisky bar and wine cellar stocked with Ch\u00e2teau Figeac and Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild, everything about Lan Hai golf club is a reminder that this is a place reserved for the privileged few. Nevertheless, Zhang hopes the middle classes will see golf as a way to get out of the city and breathe the fresh country air. \u201cTo really last,\u201d says the manager, seated on a Chesterfield sofa that\u2019s really ever so British, \u201cthis sport must become more popular.\u201d This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Xi Jinping", "World news", "Golf", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-29T14:47:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/may/31/financial-crisis-fixes-leave-policymakers-short-of-ammo-for-the-next-recession-qe", "sentences": ["Or that the recent plunge in shares on the Shanghai stock exchange are the portent of a hard landing in China."], "title": "Financial crisis fixes leave policymakers short of ammo for next recession", "article": "For 75 months it has been the same story. The nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee gather, consider all the latest evidence and decide that official interest rates should remain at 0.5%. Interest rates are at rock-bottom levels pretty much everywhere in the developed world and the moment for raising them continues to be pushed back. But central banks have not just relied on interest rates. They have also been active in the financial markets, exchanging bonds and other assets for cash. This process, known as quantitative easing, has increased the supply of money and driven down long-term interest rates. For a while, finance ministries also did their part. During the worst of the crisis in 2008-09, they cut taxes and increased spending in order to boost economic activity. In Britain, the result of running much bigger annual budget deficits led to a doubling of the national debt as a share of economic output from 40% to 80%. The stimulus worked, but only up to a point. The US, for example, has a history of bouncing back from recessions but growth has averaged only 2% a year in the six years since the economy bottomed out. Put another way, America\u2019s most severe post-war recession has been followed by the weakest recovery. The eurozone is on course to post growth of around 1.5% this year - and that\u2019s considered good. By recent standards, it is.  After all this time and all that effort, central banks would also not have expected inflation to be so low. Yet in the UK, the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index has gone negative for the first time in half a century. Earnings are increasing at half their pre-crisis rate. So, seen from the perspective of both growth and inflation, there is good reason for central banks to be wary of tightening policy. There are, though, other reasons why central banks might want to raise interest rates or to start unwinding QE. One is that too much stimulus for too long, particularly if it is of the unconventional sort, can have unintended consequences. Interest rates at close to zero plus oodles of cheap credit have encouraged a search for yield, the hunt for investments that provide a decent return. This, inevitably, means riskier bets, as it did in the years leading up to the financial crisis. One key lesson of that period is that crises can erupt even when inflation is low. The second reason central banks would have liked by now to have returned policy to a more normal setting is that they have little wriggle room if things turn nasty again. Official forecasts always assume that economies will enjoy reasonable levels of growth with modest levels of inflation. But, regular as clockwork, stuff happens. Recessions occur, often suddenly, and for all sorts of reasons. In those circumstances, central bankers and finance ministers need firepower. Ideally, they want to be in a position to slash interest rates, run bigger budget deficits and, if necessary, resort to the more unconventional instruments such as QE. This firepower is currently lacking. On average, the US Federal Reserve has cut its main interest rate by five percentage points in each of the recessions since the 1970s. That\u2019s impossible with interest rates so close to zero. Increasing QE runs the risk of further inflating share prices, which are already high. Governments can always spend and borrow more in times of trouble, but ideally would like to have built up a war chest first. In most countries, this has proved impossible. Given time, central banks and finance ministries will replenish their ammunition. Interest rates will gradually be raised. Growth will lead to higher tax returns and lower spending on welfare. It would be greatly beneficial were the global economy to be set fair for a repeat of what Lord Mervyn King described as the Nice decade (non-inflationary, continual expansion).   Related: How to get the economy working for us | Letters    But this can\u2019t be guaranteed. Imagine that Greece defaults on its debts and returns to the drachma, with knock-on effects on the eurozone and the wider global economy. Or that the recent plunge in shares on the Shanghai stock exchange are the portent of a hard landing in China. Or that the recent rise in bond yields (the interest rate paid) is a sign of a bubble about to burst. Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, calls this the world\u2019s \u201cTitanic problem\u201d, by which he means there are plenty of icebergs but no lifeboats. So what are the options for policy makers? King lists six. Firstly, they could try to avoid hitting one of the icebergs. They tighten supervision and regulation of the financial sector, force banks to hold more capital, keep a wary eye on asset prices. But the next crisis might not originate from the banks. It might stem from the insurance industry, struggling to cope with ultra-low interest rates or from over-leveraged hedge funds. Secondly, they could do more QE. Given the limited success of QE so far, coupled with the risk of dangerous side-effects, this looks unlikely to be all that effective. Thirdly, they could decide to ignore the fact that inflation is well below the targets set for central banks and decide that the threat of asset-price bubbles warrants higher interest rates. This might trigger the recession policy makers are seeking to avoid. Fourthly, they could decide to turn to fiscal policy \u2013 tax cuts and higher public spending \u2013 on the grounds that there was little scope to boost the economy through interest rates and QE. But as King notes, this is only possible if governments are \u201cwilling and able to tolerate deficits and debt levels far higher than seen in the peacetime past\u201d. Fifthly, they could resort to \u201chelicopter drops\u201d of money, which is where a central bank creates money and the finance ministry hands it out in the form of tax cuts or higher public spending. There are two downsides with this option. One is that in some countries, including the UK, the increased spending would result in higher imports and a balance of payments crisis. The second is the risk of hyper-inflation. King says his sixth and final option would be to raise retirement ages. There is a global glut of savings, he says, caused by people salting money away for their old age. Working longer would mean people spending more, raising growth rates. This would boost tax revenues and allow interest rates to rise. Governments would once again have some ammo, but at the expense of political unpopularity.  King says that if history is any guide, we are probably closer to the next US recession than the last one. Back in 2008-09, there were lifeboats even if there weren\u2019t enough of them. Next time, if there is a next time, the losses would be worse.", "tags": ["Bank of England", "Business", "Interest rates", "Economics", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Quantitative easing", "Mervyn King", "Federal Reserve", "Global economy", "US economy", "Economic policy"], "publicationDate": "2015-05-31T11:01:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/02/anger-and-resignation-at-scene-of-chinese-cruise-ship-sinking", "sentences": ["One passenger, named as 60-year-old Zhang Lifen, was so worried that she called her husband who was hundreds of miles away in Shanghai.", "\u201cWhy did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?\u201d asked Huang Yan, a Shanghai accountant who believed that her husband and father were on board."], "title": "Anger and resignation at scene of Chinese cruise ship sinking", "article": "The call that transformed Deng Liping from minivan driver to corpse collector came out of the blue at dawn on Tuesday.  \u201cThe government told me to come to the river and pick up the bodies,\u201d the 52-year-old said. \u201cThey said a ship had sunk, get ready to leave.\u201d  Less than two hours later, Deng and dozens of other volunteer drivers found themselves on the waterlogged banks of the Yangtze river at the scene of what looks likely to be China\u2019s worst shipping disaster since 1948.  Just offshore lay the upended shell of the Eastern Star, a luxury cruise ship that was carrying 458 people, including dozens of elderly tourists and a three-year-old boy, when it capsized and sank on Monday night.  By Tuesday afternoon 15 survivors had been found, including the ship\u2019s captain and chief engineer who were detained for questioning. Five dead were brought to shore.  Deng, the driver-cum-undertaker, pointed to 10 bright orange bodybags he had been given to take away some of the hundreds more who are feared dead. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d he said.  Details of the Eastern Star\u2019s terrifying final moments began to emerge on Tuesday night as darkness enveloped the small port of Damazhou, which rescue teams are using as their base.   The vessel was travelling along the world\u2019s third longest river from Nanjing to Chongqing, a major city in the south-west of the country, when it ran into trouble after hitting a ferocious storm that China\u2019s weather bureau classified as a tornado. Residents of Miaoling village, around two miles from the boat\u2019s final resting place, described a furious cyclone that uprooted trees and flooded fields and homes.  \u201cIt was a level-12 storm out on the river,\u201d said Liu Pingshan, a 45-year-old farmer. \u201cI have never seen one like that before. It is very rare.\u201d The storm alarmed the 406 tourists on the Eastern Star, most of them retirees from eastern China aged between 50 and 80, according to local reports. One passenger, named as 60-year-old Zhang Lifen, was so worried that she called her husband who was hundreds of miles away in Shanghai. \u201cIt is raining heavily and the wind is blowing like crazy,\u201d she told him, according to the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper.  Less than half an hour later, at 9.28pm, the ship keeled over in the murky brown water. It took less than two minutes for it to sink, according to the People\u2019s Daily newspaper, the Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece.     Chinese soldiers on a riverbank in Jianli. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images    By dawn a rescue operation had kicked in as hundreds of Chinese troops, police and emergency workers poured into the rural area around Jianli, the nearest city to the disaster.  \u201cWe will do everything we can to rescue everyone trapped in there, no matter if they\u2019re still alive or not and we will treat them as our own families,\u201d said Chen Shoumin, a senior military commander from Hubei province.  Images broadcast on Chinese television showed a rescue worker tapping on the ship\u2019s hull with a small hammer in an apparent attempt to find survivors trapped in underwater air pockets. As the hours passed, stories of survival began to emerge: first of a 65-year-old woman who was pulled from the wreck, then of Zhang Hui, a tour guide who escaped despite spending 10 hours in the water and not knowing how to swim. \u201cI\u2019m still alive,\u201d a jubilant Zhang told his wife and 15-year-old son in his first call home, according to Chinese state media. The 43-year-old painted a chilling portrait of the cruise ship\u2019s last moments. As the rainstorm pounded the vessel, he recalled, he began to notice more and more water coming on board. \u201cThe water continued to seep through even when you shut the windows,\u201d he said.  Within minutes the ship was listing at a 45-degree angle, sending bottles clattering to the floor. \u201cLooks like we are in trouble,\u201d he told his friend. Seconds later the boat was submerged. \u201cIf it had not happened so fast, a lot of people could\u2019ve been saved.\u201d During a visit to the disaster site on Tuesday, China\u2019s prime minister, Li Keqiang, praised the rescue effort and hailed Zhang\u2019s survival as a miracle.  He urged rescuers to \u201cseize every second, battle the fatigue and challenge the extremes\u201d in the race to find survivors, Xinhua reported. Zhang Hongxia, a local doctor, was among hundreds of people gathered on the banks of the Yangtze hoping for further miracles. \u201cThe chance of survivors is really slim,\u201d said Zhang, who works at Jianli\u2019s Number Five People\u2019s hospital. \u201c[But] it\u2019s the duty of a doctor to be here.

There was anger among some relatives that human errors as well as meteorological conditions might have contributed to the tragedy.  \u201cWhy did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?\u201d asked Huang Yan, a Shanghai accountant who believed that her husband and father were on board.  \u201cThe government must meet its responsibility,\u201d said Huang Jing, who had two relatives on board. \u201cWe need to learn what happened to our loved ones.\u201d  Additional reporting Luna Lin ", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Water transport", "Asia Pacific", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-02T16:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/families-anger-grows-in-wake-of-china-cruise-ship-sinking", "sentences": ["\u201cWe are prepared for the worst but [the government] should let us know what is really happening,\u201d said a second relative \u2013 a 35-year-old from Shanghai who asked to be named only as Mr Gu and whose mother and father-in-law were on the ship."], "title": "Families' anger grows after China cruise ship sinking", "article": "Forty-eight hours after a Chinese cruise ship carrying 456 people capsized and sank on the Yangtze river, anger and frustration is growing among relatives of those feared to have died.

By Wednesday night, just 40 of those travelling on the Eastern Star cruise ship had been accounted for \u2013 14 survivors and 26 dead.  Liu Gang, whose 68-year-old mother is missing, told the Guardian he had arrived in Jianli with a group of about 20 other families in the early hours of Wednesday.

Li Keqiang, the Chinese prime minister, urged rescue workers tocontinue their efforts despite the difficult conditions. \u201cThe whole nation is putting their hope on you,\u201d he said, according to state media. But while the Communist party has been keen to emphasise its swift response to the tragedy, both Liu and Gu said the government\u2019s lack of transparency was fuelling suspicion among relatives. \u201cTo be honest, we don\u2019t trust all the official information that is being published,\u201d said Gu.  \u201cThe families can remain calm for a day or two, but what if one day we are unable to take it any more?\u201d  \u201cI wonder why they won\u2019t let us go to the site,\u201d said Liu. \u201cWe told them that if they were worried they could organise for us to go there, but they didn\u2019t respond to our request. We came here on our own because we are anxious and sad.

China ship disaster map   However, at Jianli\u2019s main funeral parlour authorities were preparing for the worst. Shen Yuanhai, the owner of a coffin factory in the neighbouring province of Henan, said he delivered four lorries to the funeral home on Wednesday, each stacked high with refrigerated caskets. After being unloaded by a forklift truck, the coffins, which have transparent, flower-covered lids, were packed side-to-side into four halls where wakes will be held over the coming days. Zou Jinlin, a 40-year-old local who was among crowds gathered at the Rongcheng Crematorium, said she would comfort relatives by telling them: \u201cIt was a natural disaster. It wasn\u2019t human error.\u201d Her words echoed reports in China\u2019s government-controlled media that have repeatedly pointed to a tornado or cyclone as the most likely cause of Monday\u2019s disaster. \u201cUnder the special circumstance of cyclone, the pressure on the one side of the boat went beyond the standard it was designed for, resulting in the overturning of the boat,\u201d Zhong Shoudao, the president of China\u2019s Chongqing Boat Design Institute, told a press conference, according to the Associated Press. However, some relatives remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Liu Gang said he could not grasp how \u201csuch a big ship could turn upside down\u201d in the river and why the 251ft-long Eastern Star appeared to have been the only ship affected by the storm. \u201cThere were many other ships \u2013 big and small \u2013 and they were all fine. If it really was the bad weather, other ships would have been affected too,\u201d he said. Questions over whether human error could have played a role grew on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Eastern Star had been cited for \u201csafety infractions\u201d two years ago. Safety inspectors in Chongqing had given the Eastern Star the green light as recently as last month, the People\u2019s Daily, Beijing\u2019s official mouthpiece newspaper, said.  Chinese authorities appear nervous about the potential for unrest as hundreds of grieving relatives flock to the riverside town. As well as the massive rescue operation, large numbers of security forces have descended on Jianli, setting up roadblocks at major intersections. Foreign and Chinese journalists have been prevented from independently travelling to the disaster site. Attempts to interview relatives who had gathered outside Jianli\u2019s main hospital were thwarted by government volunteers in red armbands. One family was ushered into a black sedan, apparently against their will, and driven away from reporters. \u201cToo many journalists! You have to get into the car!\u201d a government volunteer told them. \u201cWe feel powerless as a member of the public, especially when government officials block the roads and do not allow us go to the site,\u201d complained Liu. For relatives thre two key questions remained: what had happened to their loved-ones and why. \u201cYou tell me, how could such a horrible disaster happen?\u201d Liu said.

France and Britain\u2019s decline is partially to blame for Europe having its lowest showing this year since the list began in 2002. In 2011, 35 of the restaurants were based in Europe while this year that was down to 26. In 2004, there were only three restaurants that were not from either Europe or North America.

El Celler de Can Roca in Girona regained its top spot this year, after dropping to second place last year. The Catalan restaurant is run by three brothers: Joan Roca as head chef, Jordi as pastry chef and Josep as sommelier.

Italy only has three of its restaurants in the list this year, but its highest placed entry, Osteria Francescana, is up into second place, leapfrogging Noma. The Modena restaurant has made the top six every year since 2010.     Italy   Australia has not had a restaurant in the top 10 since 2008 when Sydney-based Tetsuya\u2019s managed the feat.

The waterfront has been redeveloped and the park totally remodelled \u2013 it is now packed with families strolling in the summer sunshine or skating on its frozen paths, depending on the time of year. Along the way, all manner of eateries and coffee shops cater to newly acquired tastes; people on bikes speed past in the cycle lanes. Unlike the jarring, ruthless, civilisational changes of the 1990s, the changes to Moscow over the past five years were almost imperceptible on a month-to-month basis. But taken cumulatively, they have resulted in the emergence of a very different city; one that is eminently more liveable. \u201cWhat we have seen in the past few years is a change of tone, of the substance of the city,\u201d said Ilya Oskolkov-Tsentsiper, who founded the Moscow lifestyle magazine Afisha in 1999 and then the Strelka institute in central Moscow, which was set up in 2010 to be the vanguard of urban thinking in the Russian capital. \u201cSuddenly Moscow is a city where taking a nice walk on a Sunday afternoon is a normal thing to do and something pleasurable.\u201d    Suddenly Moscow is a city where taking a nice walk on a Sunday afternoon is a normal thing to do  Ilya Oskolkov-Tsentsiper        Five years ago, Gorky Park was weed-strewn and full of pot-holed roads.

A member of Vladimir Putin\u2019s United Russia party and a long-term associate of oligarch Roman Abramovich, he became the unlikely champion of a new type of city that would answer the needs of the middle class that had sprung up in recent years. He oversaw the redevelopment of Gorky Park and then ran the city\u2019s Culture Department, until he resigned earlier this year. Kapkov\u2019s departure, apparently from frustration at having his initiatives blocked, comes in parallel with a changed political climate in the country, as western sanctions and falling oiling prices combined to strike a serious blow to the economy last December, and Russian counter-sanctions banned imports of cheeses, fruits and other products from the west. Fewer Muscovites could afford to travel abroad, and fewer tourists arrived from the west, evidenced by a number of airlines cutting flights to the city in recent months. Many here are now wondering whether Kapkov\u2019s \u201cMoscow experiment\u201d is over, and how durable the changes he introduced will be.     City reformer Sergei Kapkov. Photograph: Getty    \u201cKapkov\u2019s reforms provided a whole generation of young creative types with a sense \u2013 perhaps somewhat illusory \u2013 that they could do things on a small scale; that there was a real fabric of life in a public city,\u201d said Tsentsiper. Under Yury Luzhkov, who was mayor of the city from 1992 to 2010, there was little time to think of quality of life or urban development, as Muscovites focused on getting rich, or simply surviving. Luzhkov\u2019s legendary bad taste manifested itself in the overbearing statues by his buddy Zurab Tsereteli. During his tenure cheap, gaudy architecture was often built on sites previously occupied by historic buildings that had succumbed to fire with suspiciously convenient timing, thus avoiding hefty renovation costs. Luzhkov was fired in 2010 and replaced with Sergei Sobyanin, a transition that coincided with some in Moscow beginning to think seriously about how to make the city not just richer, but more liveable. In summer 2010, Tsentsiper\u2019s Strelka institute opened with the aim of developing architecture and urban planning in the city. There was a lot of catching up to do. \u201cDuring the Soviet period, all the finances for the city came from the state; there were no other ways of financing urban development,\u201d said Evgeny Asse, a leading Moscow architect who worked in the city planning bureau in the 1980s and who took part in many projects during the Kapkov years, including work on parts of the Moscow river embankment. \u201cNow you have the dilemma of how to combine three factors: the state, developers and society. All over the world there\u2019s an issue of finding a compromise between these three players, but [elsewhere] they have decades of experience.\u201d Asse said the situation improved under Kapkov, but there is still a top-down management system in Moscow city politics \u2013 based on the old Soviet idea that the city offers \u201cgifts\u201d to its residents, rather than engaging in a symbiotic process with the population to find the ideal urban solutions.     The Kremlin embankment outside the Tretyakov Gallery has also received a major makeover. Photograph: Mark Rice-Oxley    \u201cTake pedestrianisation: they said they would make 19 kilometres of streets pedestrian and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Asse said. \u201cBut I never saw any research explaining why 19 kilometres, why the particular streets they chose, how to make these pedestrian streets the basis of life for real people. The rents get even more expensive when the streets are pedestrianised, meaning you end up with expensive boutiques that are of no use to ordinary people. The small cafes and retailers that should be the fabric of urban life can\u2019t afford to be there.\u201d Sometimes it feels like expert consultation is there \u201cmerely to provide legitimisation for bad decisions\u201d, according to Asse. He cited the example of a new hotel planned for Leningradsky Prospekt, one of the main city thoroughfares, for which one design plan envisages a mock-up of one of Stalin\u2019s \u201cSeven Sisters\u201d, the neo-gothic skyscrapers that dot Moscow. \u201cA group of us said there is nothing wrong with that style, but it would be good to find a different architectural language, to avoid talking in stereotypes. But they told us the mayor had already made his decision. So then what was the point of having us in the role of experts?\u201d         Watch other Muscovites discussing their city here    As well as the top-down transformations, there have been more organic changes to the city as huge numbers of Muscovites began travelling regularly and bringing back ideas from their trips. Levels of customer service are still probably the worst of any European capital, but truly egregious rudeness and aggression are now the exception rather than the norm, as a whole generation of Muscovites who have travelled the world no longer find surly, Soviet-style service acceptable at home. The brash, flash-the-cash hedonism of the early post-Soviet years has given way to a new, more mature eating-and-drinking scene. A plethora of cafes, bars and restaurants have been opened by people who are enthusiastic about food and drink, rather than just keen to make a quick profit. Tours to Brooklyn in New York were organised for Moscow restaurant owners to give them menu and design ideas, and some chefs have begun experimenting with updated versions of traditional Russian ingredients and recipes. Indeed, the gradual discovery of a collective Moscow foodie gene resembles the gastronomic changes in Britain of two decades ago. Many link the increased \u201cofficial\u201d interest in urban thinking with an attempt to channel the energy of this new middle class: the Muscovites who have done well from the oil-boom years, travel frequently, and wanted to introduce some change at home. After the protest movement that swept the capital in 2011-12, extra thought was paid to the idea of what to do with the movement and its most charismatic leader, Alexei Navalny, a Muscovite who said he wanted to stand for mayor. The Russian authorities have see-sawed over Navalny, with some elements keen to lock him up, and others believing he should be allowed to operate, then defeated politically. While he has faced frequent court cases and his brother has been jailed, he was also allowed to stand in mayoral elections in 2013 \u2013 the idea being that, with all the attention now lavished on the new urban middle class, they would not require opposition politics. Despite Sobyanin\u2019s use of the \u201cadministrative resource\u201d and skewed media coverage, however, Navalny got an impressive 27% of the vote \u2013 not enough to force a second round, but enough to vindicate those in the Kremlin who felt he should never have been allowed to stand in the first place.    If you think falsifying elections is bad, no amount of bicycles are going to help you  Alexei Navalny        Alexei Navalny walks out of a Moscow detention centre on 6 March, 2015. Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters    \u201cThe scheme of bringing hipsters to Sobyanin by giving them all this nice stuff didn\u2019t work,\u201d said Asse. \u201cIt became more and more clear that Kapkov\u2019s policies were somehow in contradiction to the general trend in the country. He was never in opposition, but his heroes were not the heroes of the Kremlin.\u201d \u201cOf course you can\u2019t deny the improvements, they are there,\u201d said Navalny himself, when asked about the city\u2019s recent changes. \u201cBut basically, what has happened is there was a huge gap in quality of life between Moscow and most normal western cities, and we\u2019ve closed that gap slightly. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any correlation between bicycle lanes and political activity. If you think falsifying elections is bad, no amount of bicycles are going to help you.\u201d Navalny lives in a small apartment in the outlying region of Marino, a grey suburb where he says little has changed in the past few years. Given the amount of money Moscow authorities have at their disposal, he added, what is amazing is that much more has not been done. \u201cWhen I stood for mayor in 2013, we did the sums and only Shanghai and New York had bigger municipal budgets. It was the third biggest municipal budget in the world; if things were done more efficiently, you should be able to improve more than a couple of parks with this money.\u201d     A model shows off a Vladimir Putin ring during Moscow\u2019s recent New Russian fashion contest. Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters    Kapkov\u2019s idea that the energy of creative, possibly opposition-minded Muscovites should be channelled into improving the fabric of the city had failed. He declined to be interviewed for this article, but in a Facebook post announcing his resignation, he wrote: \u201cFor those who come after me, I would ask you to remember that our bosses are the city\u2019s residents, not its rulers. Muscovites are self-sufficient, they don\u2019t need choices made for them and they don\u2019t need to be taught. We need to respect them and their choices. The city is made up of people: diverse, difficult, different people. Listen to them, and you\u2019ll be amazed how easy it is to make the right decisions.\u201d The big question, and the one to which nobody knows the answer, is what comes next for Moscow. The war in Ukraine, a more aggressive nationalism, and the atmosphere that led to the murder of Boris Nemtsov, have all pointed to the city becoming more introverted and withdrawn. \u201cWhen I see my young friends opening another food market or something similar, they seem to be strangely out of touch with this new zeitgeist,\u201d said Tsentsiper. His consultancy company is now working on the revamping of VDNKh, a huge Soviet-era exhibition centre. It is also developing a startup which aims to provide an affordable, off-the-shelf renovation service for the 83% of Muscovites who live in standardised Soviet-era housing. For all that Kapkov lost his battles, however, there remains a certain legacy, both for Moscow and Russia as a whole. Regional administrations across the country have suddenly become interested in the renovation of parks and the rejuvenation of public space. In Moscow, many of the positive changes to the fabric of the city are hard to undo, whatever happens. Many people worry there are changes in the air, but hope is far from lost \u2013 with some suggesting that if the Europeanisation of Moscow is over, the end of this copycat urban development may not be such a bad thing anyway.   Related: How much do you know about Moscow? \u2013 quiz    \u201cThe history of Russian culture has always been a pendulum swinging between love with the west and a more introverted search for its true self,\u201d Tsentsiper said. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there has been a lot of looking to the west and copying from it. There has been a lack of a narrative about who we are, what we are, and why we are here. Perhaps it won\u2019t be the worst thing in the world if the pendulum now swings back to an interest in Russia and Russianness.\u201d  How is Moscow changing for you?

The morning gathering, led by the head, Mr Warburton, often involved listening to a traditional tale underpinning a moral lesson. The one that struck me most was the story of The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes. Not because it was particularly engrossing, but because I couldn\u2019t believe that the underlying message was plausible. My seven-year-old brain told me it was ridiculous that everyone would just go along with a set of ideas when the obvious, and entirely opposite, truth was staring them incontrovertibly in the face.  Fast forward to the present day, and now I understand the need for the story \u2013 grown-ups really do act in this way and it\u2019s making me cross \u2013 very cross. On my way to work last week, BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme trotted out the usual headlines about coasting schools and their impending fate. Our newish education secretary and minister for women and equalities, Nicky Morgan, informed listeners that her new bill would \u201cremove the bureaucratic and legal loopholes\u201d that slow the process of failing schools being turned into academies. Surely that\u2019s good news then, as there are no failing academies and no areas of good practice outside this governance model. In 2013, some established educational thinkers published Unleashing Greatness (PDF), a report which looks at the risks and opportunities associated with the rapid expansion of academies. It said: \u201cIndeed, many schools in disadvantaged areas that have been performing below par have done just as well as those which embarked on the academy route.\u201d Following the education select committee\u2019s report on academies in January 2015, committee members, including its chair Graham Stuart MP, confirmed that the performance and impact of academies was yet to be fully understood or evaluated. As Becky Francis, professor of education at King\u2019s College London, said at the time: \u201cThe evidence on whether or not academies have had more success in raising achievement than other equivalent schools is mixed and hard to pin down.\u201d The truth is that there are good academies and poor ones. There are many good maintained schools and, again, there are poor ones. The issue with academies highlights a greater problem in our education system: people seem to purvey a lot of nonsense about panaceas for the problems in education when most of us know the truth. We lurch from Sweden to Shanghai in search of best practice, but rarely take into account even the most basic social and cultural differences between one country and another. Fads come and go, but the problems remain. There are not enough able school leaders to go around and our exam system has been broken for years.School leaders are still frantically searching for the most accessible exam syllabi after major curriculum reform and wondering why the independent sector is allowed to use different examinations from the rest of us. League tables are fundamentally flawed as much of their data lacks credibility, and Ofsted relies too heavily on such data in its attempt to assure quality and add rigour to its assessments. Some inspectors have the track record and credibility to see this; others do not.   Related: Secret Teacher: I'll never work for an academy chain again    Even more importantly, all schools are facing an unprecedented recruitment crisis that is making the prospect of improved standards for children increasingly remote. Meanwhile, agencies are charging us exorbitant sums to ensure we are fully staffed \u2013 at least on paper. There are a number of ways in which schools can improve their performance. Education itself must be championed by all those who are affected \u2013 that\u2019s pretty much everyone. We need committed and inspirational people, but we are not getting nearly enough graduates to join the profession. We have to make the job attractive and desirable. The formalised system of school-to-school support must be broadened beyond the work of teaching schools, national leaders and support schools. We must take care that those entrusted to deliver such help are best placed to do it effectively. It is not always the case that outstanding schools can improve weaker ones if their contexts are different. Above all, we need a professionalised national council or trust that leads our system with authority and credibility. The \u201ceducation spring\u201d put forward by Professor Mick Waters and others provides an appropriate framework for this. A single syllabus for each subject area and improved data \u2013 quantitative and qualitative \u2013 could then be agreed on. The obsession with academies often misses the point, as a more subtle and creative approach to school improvement is urgently required. The emperor really does need to be told to stop being so silly, as education is too important \u2013 just ask Mr Warburton.

The British pharmaceutical company had employed the couple to investigate bribery claims at the company and a sex tape featuring the then head of GSK China. Soon after the couple began their investigations, Chinese authorities accused GSK of funnelling up to 3bn yuan (\u00a3312m) to bribe doctors to buy their medicines. Humphrey later criticised the pharmaceutical firm for not revealing the full extent of the allegations against them.

The couple, who were paraded on state television in handcuffs and orange prison vests, were charged with illegally purchasing information about Chinese citizens, including ID and phone numbers.

The Chinese firm has been working on autonomous vehicles for the past couple of years, recently partnering with car makers including BMW.  The two companies announced a self-driving research project in April 2014, driving test cars around the complex highways of Beijing and Shanghai. Wang Jin, Baidu\u2019s senior vice president, told the China cloud computing services summit that the company would launch a new self-driving car with BMW in China before the year is out. The prototype car will be used to test road-readiness of Baidu\u2019s technology, which will involve the car driving itself but still have human controls. The race for the roads Google recently unveiled a new series of prototype vehicles built from the ground up to be self-driving cars, having previously modified Lexus sport utility vehicles and Toyota hybrid cars for testing purposes. Its new car aims to completely replace human control with artificial intelligence, reducing controls to a destination selector and a start/stop button. A version with a human driver will be tested on public roads in the near future. Baidu is taking a more traditional route to the self-driving car. Its head of deep learning, Kai Yu, said last year that the technology it was developing was designed to assist drivers rather than replace them. The Chinese firm has its own data-mapping service, which is a prerequisite to any automotive robotics project, and invested $10m in a Finnish mapping startup IndoorAtlas in September last year. It also has undertaken extensive artificial intelligence research, including machine learning and the technologies needed for computer vision for cars and other robotics, rivalling those of Google. But Baidu has one major advantage over its US rivals. Many of the driving-assisted vehicles on the road today, including the Tesla Model S, are technically capable of driving themselves. Legislative hurdles Tesla\u2019s chief executive predicted that self-driving vehicles would be available to buy within three years during the unveiling of an \u201cautopilot mode\u201d for his Model S electric car, which will be capable of driving itself to a parking and charging spot. While the technology has yet to be proven, the major hurdle to autonomous vehicles on public roads is legislation. Several US states have allowed autonomous test vehicles on to public roads, which has allowed Google to test its cars for the last couple of years, but drivers must always be present and capable of taking over at any time. While the UK has a series of government-funded studies on the use of autonomous vehicles is underway, legislation lags technology in both the UK and US. A series of complex issues about who is to blame if something goes wrong, what an autonomous car should do in an emergency and extensive safety requirements have yet to be solved. China and Baidu could steal a march on the West through flexible legislation. The Chinese government has more power to rapidly mandate the kind of wholesale changes that would be required to unleash self-driving cars. Pods, cars or self-driving taxis There is still some debate over in what form self-driving cars will emerge. Automotive manufacturers are working on their own technology with the clear ambition of selling a traditional car that can drive itself - something Baidu seems to agree with. Others are working on autonomous vehicles that could be seen as pool cars or a form of public transport, with driverless vehicles operating as shuttles or bus replacements.  While Google\u2019s self-driving pods resemble the latter, Uber, for instance, is working on autonomous vehicles with the aim of running a taxi service that do not require human drivers. \u2022 Google acknowledges its self-driving cars had 11 minor accidents \u2022 Volvo to test autonomous cars with ordinary drivers on public roads by 2017", "tags": ["Self-driving cars", "Artificial intelligence (AI)", "China", "Technology", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Robots", "Motoring"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-10T13:49:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/11/four-left-behind-children-in-china-die-of-poisoning-after-being-abandoned-by-parents", "sentences": ["\u201cIt\u2019s very heartbreaking \u2013 but it\u2019s not completely unforeseeable.\u201d \u201cThere must be something wrong with our child protection system, otherwise this wouldn\u2019t have happened again,\u201d said Chen Fucai, an expert on child welfare from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.", "\u201cUnless we have a proper child protection system, similar tragedies will repeat themselves whether it be in Bijie, in Shanghai or in Guangzhou.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin"], "title": "Four 'left-behind' children in China die of poisoning after being abandoned", "article": "Police in China are investigating the death of four impoverished siblings who reportedly drank pesticide after being abandoned by their parents, a tragedy exposing the hardships facing millions of so-called \u201cleft-behind\u201d children.

Both parents were migrant workers who had abandoned one of the country\u2019s poorest regions to seek employment, it reported. The children had dropped out of school one month ago and had virtually no food \u201cbecause they are too poor\u201d, Zhang Shigui, a relative, was quoted as saying. The children\u2019s father had left a contact number but it had not been possible to reach him, Zhang added. Police said they were investigating the precise causes of the children\u2019s deaths but Xinhua suggested they had deliberately poisoned themselves. The tragedy is not the first of its kind to hit Bijie, a notoriously deprived city that is 1,120 miles (1,802km) south-west of Beijing and has around 8.5 million residents. On the night of November 15, 2012 \u2013 the same day Xi Jinping became leader of China\u2019s Communist party \u2013 another group of left-behind children took shelter from the cold in a rubbish bin.  The next morning, an elderly lady found the bodies of those five boys \u2013 aged 13, 12, 11 and nine. They had died of carbon monoxide poisoning after lighting a fire inside the bin to keep warm.  \u201cThese children wandered the streets for three weeks, but no helping hand was extended,\u201d Caixin, a current affairs magazine, argued at the time, warning: \u201cThe tragedy in Bijie is bound to happen again.\u201d The latest deaths have again highlighted the plight of the estimated 60 million children who are left behind \u2013 often without proper supervision \u2013 when their parents leave their rural villages to find jobs in China\u2019s booming cities.  \u201cThe kids in both cases were left-behind children who had dropped out of school and had been left at home,\u201d said Li Yuanlong, a local journalist who was detained in 2012 after reporting on the five children\u2019s deaths.  \u201cI think there must be problems at every level of society for this tragedy to have repeated itself.

In my book, Mrs Thatcher was never more likable than when she took out her handkerchief and knotted it around the tail of a model British Airways jet to hide a new design that disowned the union flag \u2013 BA then trying to be \u201cthe world\u2019s favourite airline\u201d, embracing a thousand cultures and belonging nowhere in particular. Midland isn\u2019t, I admit, the most inspiring of names. My clockwork toy engine had LMS painted on the side, and when I discovered this meant London, Midland and Scottish railway, the middle initial represented an area that was far less attractive to me than the other two; the most middling, you might say. Likewise with British Midland, the defunct airline, or the adjective \u201cMidlands\u201d when attached to professions such as writer, comedian and pop star. But this is no more than a thoughtless calumny; there is DH Lawrence, Philip Larkin and George Eliot to consider as well as Slade and Jasper Carrott. The Midland Bank arrived long before any of them. It opened a Birmingham office in 1836, grew by absorbing its local rivals, and in the last years of the 19th century got a foothold in the capital when it merged with the Central Bank of London to become the London City and Midland Bank. By 1918, expansion through acquisition had made the Midland the biggest bank in the world, and its innovations and emphasis on customer service over the next 80 years (it was \u201cthe listening bank\u201d) kept it among Britain\u2019s so-called \u201cbig four\u201d retail banks until, in 1992, it was taken over by a bank with very different origins \u2013 in imperial trade rather than domestic manufacturing. To secure the takeover, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which had been founded by a Scottish shipping grandee in the 1860s, moved its headquarters to London and reinvented itself as HSBC Holdings. HSBC then began to buy banks everywhere until, like the Midland before it, it could claim to be the world\u2019s largest, with 266,000 employees spread across 80 countries and, eventually, a reputation stained by the tax evasion and money laundering that it permitted some of its customers. On a British high street, unlike, say, in a trader\u2019s office on the Shanghai Bund, the letters HSBC meant little or nothing. But at least they were a straightforward abbreviation, like ICI or BR or BOAC: meaning could be got with just a little delving. The next generation of company titles were much more opaque. When the drink-and-food businesses Guinness and Grand Metropolitan merged in 1997, the Wolff Olins branding consultancy was commissioned to devise a new group title and came up with Diageo, which according to its Wikipedia entry splices the Latin word for \u201cday\u201d with the Greek word for \u201cworld\u201d and somehow implies that its products give pleasure every day, everywhere. (It was also Wolff Olins who devised the logo for the London Olympics, which managed to be both ugly and anonymous.) Three years later, Norwich Union merged with another insurance company, CGU (a semi-abbreviation that came from an earlier merger of Commercial Union and General Accident), and after a poll of shareholders adopted the name Aviva on the grounds that it was memorable and universal \u2013 at least if you took the universe to mean people who\u2019d done Latin at school or knew a Latinate language. To anyone who grew up with Norwich Union advertisements that ran the line \u201cA fine city, Norwich\u201d beneath a dignified picture of the castle or cathedral, this seemed a loss; it may even be that by abandoning this civic identity, Aviva contributed to \u2013 or did nothing to prevent \u2013 Norwich\u2019s later reputation as a Hicksville that could tolerate Alan Partridge. How much these changes cost, and to what profit, is anyone\u2019s guess. Certainly, branding consultants don\u2019t come cheap. One imagines the boardroom meetings, the assistants bringing coffee, Evian and fresh fruit, the PowerPoint presentations, the Venn diagrams, the long pursuit of the word that will serve the business best, until after all that labour a mouse is at last brought forth \u2013 Diageo, Aviva, Arriva \u2013 and with it the bill for a million or so, not including VAT. These days it can be done for much less expense. I recommend a trip to the online agency BrandBucket, where you can buy a domain name and its logo for as little as $1,395. Bonbilla, for example, or Fantigo or Prudentum or Dignico or Nonova: there are 6,500 invented or \u201ccoined\u201d names for sale, each ready to grow your business \u201cwith unique sounds that evoke a variety of different feelings\u201d, each of them \u201chand-selected\u201d having passed \u201ca series of tests for pronunciation, spelling and unique character\u201d. A business can narrow the choice by the line of trade it pursues. The filter marked \u201cfood\u201d, for example, reveals a selection that includes Freshara, Mintero, Greeniva and Luvabite. This Cubist arrangement of the familiar \u2013 the stuff of nightmares \u2013 might have Esperanto as its inspiration, or Edward Lear or the late Professor Stanley Unwin. As the last might have said, irritatingly, \u201cNever a diageo by when I don\u2019t aviva myself of a nice-o cuppo tea in the early mordy.\u201d For all this nonsense, the route back to the Midland could with any luck mark the beginning of the end. Paris, finished? Not while it\u2019s got this bookshop In Paris this week, I remembered how John Lewis\u2019s managing director, Andy Street, had described France as \u201csclerotic\u201d and \u201cfinished\u201d in a speech a few months ago to a gathering of young British entrepreneurs. \u201cNothing works,\u201d he said, \u201cand nobody cares about it.\u201d Perhaps the Seine glittering in the June sunshine provided a version of rose-tinted glasses, but it seemed to me that one or two things \u201cwork\u201d better in Paris than in London. One is a housing market that hasn\u2019t been skewed by international capital: a flat in central Paris, which is undoubtedly one of the world\u2019s most attractive townscapes, costs about the same as a flat in Hackney, which isn\u2019t. The other is the great number of independent bookshops: Paris has nearly a thousand of them, roughly 10 times as many as London. Man cannot live by independent bookshops alone, and I realise they aren\u2019t necessarily a mark of a healthier or more equal society. But that a shop as charming and well stocked as Shakespeare and Company can flourish bang in the city centre, just across the river from the Notre Dame, suggests that the city and its regulations have got something right. Three years ago its owner, Sylvia Whitman, employed seven staff; now she employs 30, and this summer will open a cafe in an adjacent building, where the items on the menu of this old American outpost will include Flapjack Kerouac and (my personal favourite) The Bun Also Rises. Other suggestions will no doubt be welcome \u2013 but to Whitman rather than me.  This article was amended on 15 June 2015. It originally used the term acronym when referring to abbreviations such as HSBC and ICI. The term acronym only applies to abbreviations that can be pronounced as words. This has been corrected.

When the first third of Finnegans Wake, his last and most notoriously difficult book, was published in Shanghai in 2013, newspapers in Britain and America greeted the announcement as a momentous event. Certainly, the salient details of the story are arresting: 72 years had passed since the publication of the novel in London in 1941; seven years had elapsed since Dai Congrong had agreed to undertake the formidable task of translation; and when the book appeared between luxuriously silky dark-green boards, heavy with pages of explanatory notes, it became an immediate commercial success. By what miracles of linguistic mastery and literary imagination could Chinese characters be made to capture Joyce\u2019s mind-bending manipulations of the alphabet? By what subtleties of cross-cultural understanding could the specificities of Ireland and its mythologies be translated for a Chinese audience? Could the translation be trusted if it made Finnegans Wake a bestseller? When Ulysses was first published in Paris in 1922, Joyce responded with delight to news that an order had been placed from China: \u201cTen copies to Peking!\u201d he exclaimed. Ulysses, even more than Finnegans Wake, is alive in China today. Two Joyce-themed stage productions have recently toured major Chinese cities. Both are the brainchildren of Andy Arnold, the artistic director of Glasgow\u2019s Tron theatre, and form part of a programme of performances for a UK-China Year of Cultural Exchange. The first, A Journey Round James Joyce, offers an elegantly devised biographical reimagining of Joyce\u2019s life in Trieste between 1905 and 1915. The second, Ulysses, is a revival of the Tron\u2019s successful 2012 production of Dermot Bolger\u2019s adaptation (A Dublin Bloom, 1996). They performed to full and enthusiastic houses in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Jinan. For much of the 20th century, Joyce\u2019s name was not one to be lightly pronounced or printed in China. Even as late as 1982 \u2013 as Jin Di, Ulysses\u2019s first translator, reports \u2013 a state official commenting on the centenary of Joyce\u2019s birth described the world of Leopold Bloom as \u201cshocking in its pettiness, obscurity, ugliness, and confusion\u201d and as emblematic of \u201cthe decadence of the modern bourgeoisie\u201d.     James Joyce in 1934. Photograph: Lipnitzki/Roger Viollet/Getty Images    Yet by 1996, not one but two versions of Ulysses were available to Chinese readers. The novel sold very well, and western newspapers, as they would later about Finnegans Wake, commented on Ulysses\u2019s bestseller status in China with a mixture of excitement and bemusement. But the book\u2019s journey had in a sense only begun. Works of such length and complexity take time to percolate into a nation\u2019s living rooms and classrooms. These days, if you ask about James Joyce \u2013 or \u201cZhanmusi Qiaoyisi\u201d, as his name is transliterated in Chinese pinyin \u2013 in a Chinese bookshop you will be led to shelves lined with relevant volumes. The vast five-floor Xinhua bookshop on Wangfujing, a crowded shopping avenue just round the corner from Tiananmen Square, currently stocks no fewer than four different editions of Ulysses \u2013 one in English, and three in Chinese. Copies of Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Exiles and Finnegans Wake are also available. The tastes and identifications of China\u2019s expanding and dynamic middle class are part of the explanation for this renaissance. Where Joyce stood for bourgeois corruption only three decades ago, he now stands for cosmopolitan sophistication. Chinese people have an affectionate epithet for those particularly enamoured of the western way of life and its consumer comforts: they call such internationally minded bourgeois \u201cxiaozi\u201d \u2013 literally, \u201clittle capitalists\u201d. It is to a large degree such educated \u201cxiaozi\u201d who are driving the success of Arnold\u2019s plays. A Journey Round James Joyce was conceived specifically with China in mind. Performed in Chinese by Chinese actors, the play conjures Joyce and Nora Barnacle\u2019s departure from Ireland, Joyce\u2019s carousing in the bars of Trieste, the language lessons he gave to make a living, Nora\u2019s housekeeping and henpecking, his writing and its connections to his experiences in exile. The script consists of an ingenious collage of quotations assembled from many corners of Joyce\u2019s works and letters. In its departures from biographical fact and disruptions of chronological sequence, A Journey Round James Joyce bears some likeness to the theatrical fantasy by which Tom Stoppard imagined Joyce\u2019s life in Z\u00fcrich in Travesties in 1974. Yet the tone of this piece is quite different, fluctuating between broad comedy and romance, tension and melodrama. To western eyes, the sight and sound of a Chinese James Joyce and Nora Barnacle is completely disorienting (Joyce\u2019s recognisable glasses are at first the only obvious echo of a familiar story) and a thought-provoking reminder of the extent of the differences translations have to negotiate. As the play unfolds, snippets of the Irish songs and Italian operas Joyce loved (\u201cDown by the Salley Gardens\u201d, Madame Butterfly) add to the international ambiance of the Journey. The costumes and the exquisitely minimalist set are the fruits of Arnold\u2019s collaboration with Beijing\u2019s Xinchan theatre. Arnold\u2019s Ulysses is a wilder piece of theatre. Performed in English with Chinese surtitles, the play stages a recapitulation of all the novel\u2019s best-known moments \u2013 a \u201cgreatest hits\u201d formula. But the play makes great demands on anyone encountering Joyce\u2019s world for the first time: it would be fairly difficult, without prior knowledge of the book, and without a sense of the Dublin world in which it is rooted, to make head or tail of the spectacular whirligig of scenes by which Arnold recreates the events of Bloomsday. The play inverts the chronology of Joyce\u2019s book by presenting the events of 16 June 1904 as the stuff of Bloom\u2019s dreams after his return to the marital bed in the early hours of the following morning. The re-enactment of the key moments of his day is interwoven with excerpts from his wife Molly\u2019s famous closing soliloquy. What the Tron emphatically brings to Ulysses is the inventive energy and the daring to engage with a classic text.

The truth is that the events of January merely accentuated a decline in trade for luxury hotels in Paris    \u201cIt scared everyone,\u201d Le Calvez says. The cost for Le Bristol, despite its choice location on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, was steep. \u201cWe had cancellations worth \u20ac400,000 ($456,000) in the week following the violence.\u201d But \u201ceveryone is hurting\u201d, he adds. \u201cNor is Le Bristol the worst off \u2026 between January and April it was the top hotel in Paris [in terms of revenue] and in second place for average expenditure.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Delahaye, general manager of the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, also registered a drop in custom between January and March, but this had little impact. It reopened in August 2014, after eight months\u2019 refurbishment, and soon \u201crecovered its market share\u201d, Delahaye says. Indeed on some occasions, such as the recent visit by the Indian prime minister, the hotel was full. The truth is that the events of January merely accentuated a decline in trade for luxury hotels in Paris. The downturn started in the last quarter of 2014. Le Bristol is typical of this two-stage trend. Revenue fell by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2014, but plummeted by 20% in the first three months of this year. \u201cIt started in October,\u201d Donet explains, coinciding with the Plaza relaunch and the availability of 200 brand-new suites and rooms at the Peninsula. So in autumn 2014, \u201cwith a glut in supply, demand failed to keep pace\u201d, Donet adds. Indeed, last July, she forecast \u201ca choppy passage\u201d for the capital\u2019s top\u00a0hotels. Prior to that, the select group of luxury establishments \u201cenjoyed an exceptional situation\u201d, Donet says. In 2013 the Ritz and the Crillon closed, at a time when work was still under way at the Plaza and Peninsula. So at that point, \u201cthere were more customers and fewer luxury hotels on the market\u201d. But the underlying trend was towards overcapacity. \u201cBetween 2007 and 2017 the capacity of luxury hotels in Paris will have increased by 60%. Which is huge!\u201d she points out. The Ritz and the Crillon will be reopening in the next two years, so by 2017 luxury accommodation in Paris will amount to 1,850 rooms and suites, as against only 1,150 in 2007. The rise in supply has not so far triggered a price war. \u201cWith the social charges we have to pay, it\u2019s quite impossible to lower our prices,\u201d Delahaye says. The response is the same at Le Bristol, where the management is determined to \u201cstay on course\u201d, rejecting \u201ca policy of lower prices\u201d. However, speaking off the record, some sources have alleged that the luxury hotels \u201chave drastically reduced prices to maintain or improve their occupancy rate\u201d. Donet confirms this: \u201cPrices dropped by 4% between October and March.\u201d But the trend is bottoming out. In March, she explains, they only fell by 1.5% to flatten out at an average charge for a room in a luxury establishment of \u20ac1,000. This is substantially higher than in London, where the average price is about \u20ac700 a night. In practice, the main factor pushing prices down has been the lack of customers from the Middle East. They like to take suites, the most expensive apartments in these hotels and the main money-spinner. A night in a suite at the Peninsula costs \u20ac25,000. The Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e charges \u20ac27,000 for its 500-square- metre suite. \u201cNot including breakfast,\u201d Delahaye says. Over the year this accommodation is nevertheless occupied almost two-thirds of the time.    Women customers will have the final say, because what matters is being close to the luxury goods outlets    The question everyone is asking is how much longer the gloom will last. The management at both the Plaza and Le Bristol believe that trade will improve in the summer. \u201cThere is rising enthusiasm this summer and we have already had a lot of bookings,\u201d says Delahaye. At Le Bristol the mood is similarly upbeat. \u201cLe Bourget, which opens in mid-June, draws a large, up-market clientele to Paris,\u201d Donet says. The sort of visitors who book plenty of suites. However, many people in the trade think that, in addition to the problem of overcapacity expected to last another five to six years, luxury hotels in general are inevitably heading for a period of restructuring. In 2017, 11 luxury hotels will be in competition in the French capital, or maybe 12, counting the hotel slated to be built at the former La Samaritaine department store. Ultimately about half a dozen will emerge from the pack. \u201cThe remaining four or five will need to be repositioned,\u201d Donet predicts. It will be a tough battle, but the key factor in the outcome will be geographical position. Moreover, women customers will have the final say, because what matters is being close to the luxury goods outlets. \u201cIt will be just too bad for a hotel closer to a M\u00e9tro entrance than to the Dior boutique,\u201d quips the head of a well-placed contender. So properties on Avenue Montaigne or close to Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 or Place Vend\u00f4me \u2013 the Plaza, Bristol, Ritz or Crillon \u2013 will enjoy a certain advantage. The other threat is the boom in boutique hotels, which offer upscale accommodation but charge \u20ac350 to \u20ac550 on average per night. Following the trend set by Costes, on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, La R\u00e9serve entered the fray in autumn 2014. Others are expected to follow. Word has it that a five-star JK Place, with 32 rooms, will open on Rue de Lille in 2017.

Her career-long interest is in documenting disappearing cultural practices, and in 2005 she got chatting to a Shanghai taxi driver about foot binding. \u201cHe mentioned that his grandmother had bound feet,\u201d Farrell recalls. \u201cMost people told me that it was such an old tradition, there were no women left. I went to the village of the cab driver\u2019s grandmother, in the Shandong province, and met Zang Yun Ying. She became the first woman in my project.\u201d What followed was a nine-year journey across China, tracking down the last survivors of foot binding. She found just 50 women. Five of them were still completely bound and in hiding, but most had released their binds. All were from impoverished villages in the provinces of Yunnan and Shandong. The oldest, Zhang Yun Ying, was 103. Farrell\u2019s photobook Living History: Bound Feet Women of China, contains close-up portraits of the severe deformity they suffered.  Foot binding was outlawed in China 103 years ago, following almost 10 decades of the practice. But the last factory producing \u201clotus shoes\u201d \u2013 the triangular embroidered platforms used to showcase the women\u2019s minuscule pointy feet \u2013 closed just six years ago.    The first year is particularly excruciating because the girls had to walk until their toes would break  Jo Farrell     To create the desirable \u201clotus feet\u201d, first made fashionable under Emperor Li Yu in the 10th century, women would have their toes taped together tightly into triangular points. The feet were beaten, cast in herbs and oils to loosen the skin and strapped into lotus shoes. After foot binding was banned it became taboo, and in 1950 Chairman Mao ordered anti foot-binding inspectors to publicly shame any bound women they found. \u201cIt was considered an old tradition that did not reflect modern China and should be stopped,\u201d Farrell tells me from her flat in Hong Kong. \u201cTheir binding would be hung in windows so that people would laugh at them.\u201d Most women were bound at the age of seven. \u201cThe first year is particularly excruciating because the girls were made to walk until their toes would break under their weight,\u201d says Farrell. \u201cAfter that, the toes became numb and now, 50 or 60 years later, they don\u2019t have any pain in their feet. It\u2019s all quite numb.\u201d Farrell insists her photo series isn\u2019t meant to sensationalise, but to educate us about a little-known custom. She admits she was surprised by her own reaction to seeing bound feet close up. \u201cThe first time I met Zang Yun Ying and held her foot in my hand it was just incredible \u2013 so soft and so incredibly formed.\u201d  In spite of the brutality the project lays bare, its message is one of hope, survival and grit. \u201cIn Chinese society, it was the only way forward for women,\u201d says Farrell. \u201cThey did it because they thought it would give them a better future, a better life.\u201d", "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "China", "Photography", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-15T06:00:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/15/bloomsday-fans-around-the-world-celebrating-james-joyces-ulysses", "sentences": ["The manuscript for Ulysses makes its home here, and as such a lynchpin of our collection, we are compelled by our mission to help make it accessible to all.\u201d China Berry, illustrator of a graphic novel adaptation  of Ulysses, has already lectured and exhibited his drawings this weekend in Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University and the Shanghai Grand Theatre."], "title": "Bloomsday: how fans around the world will be celebrating James Joyce's Ulysses", "article": "James Joyce chose to immortalise his first outing with Nora Barnacle, the woman who would eventually become his wife, in his great novel Ulysses, making 16 June 1904 the date on which his protagonist Leopold Bloom goes about his business in Dublin. Over 100 years later, Joyce enthusiasts around the world choose to celebrate the date in their own way. We talk to fans from Brazil to China about how they\u2019re marking Bloomsday this year. Dublin, Ireland Mark Traynor at the James Joyce Centre in Dublin estimates there are around 40 events planned in the city for Bloomsday, from walking tours to public readings led by drag queen Panty Bliss to Stephen Fry in conversation with senator David Norris. \u201cBloomsday has always been quite visible here, primarily because people dress up in Edwardian garb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt definitely makes an impact on the city and it draws people in.\u201d   Related: In Bloom's shadow: a tour of Dublin in search of James Joyce's homes    There are also Bloomsday breakfasts planned, following the intricate description at the beginning of the novel \u2013 \u201cMr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods\u2019 roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine\u201d \u2013 and an after party. \u201cIt\u2019s become part of the cultural fabric of the city,\u201d said Traynor. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll get the core Joyceans, those who are obsessed with Joyce, but Bloomsday is also an excuse for everyone else to get involved. It\u2019s a great point of entry for people \u2013 a safe space for people to be proud of Joyce\u2019s work, his legacy, and of the city itself, because obviously the book is a celebration of Dublin.\u201d     Bloomsday in New Zealand \u2026 songs and readings in the Thirsty Dog pub    Auckland, New Zealand Usually, says Dean Parker, he helps stage a musical show in Auckland\u2019s red light district: a three-hour musical cabaret of dramatised episodes from Ulysses. Last year was a \u201cstunning, jam-packed success\u201d, with Lucy Lawless, aka Xena Warrior Princess, reading Molly Bloom\u2019s soliloquy. \u201cBy the time of the soliloquy the audience was pretty liquored up as Lawless (who\u2019s from a prominent Auckland Irish family) had whacked a thousand bucks down on the bar for Guinness and shorts. One of the cast reported he\u2019d been outside having a smoke when a punter burst out into the street hollering, \u2018They\u2019re giving away the beer in there!\u2019\u201d he says. This year, they\u2019re sticking to songs and readings in the Thirsty Dog pub, due to \u201cexhaustion and over-commitments elsewhere\u201d. It\u2019s \u201cnext to Suzie Wong\u2019s Massage Parlour\u201d, he adds. Pula, Croatia Taking place from 14 to 16 June is the fifth Bloomsday Croatia festival, which organisers say will include \u201cjoy and Joyce, literature and cinema, and dance and music\u201d \u2013 as well as a performance by the preschoolers of Pula of Joyce\u2019s children\u2019s book The Cat and the Devil. There\u2019ll be Irish dance, readings, lectures, a cocktail night featuring Molly and Poldy cocktails, an exhibition and a concert. \u201cWe are a team of Joyce enthusiasts from Croatia where he used to live in 1904 following his self-exile from Dublin with Nora Barnacle. We started off as a group of students of English five years ago and in the meantime we graduated from the universities, and became a festival which this year celebrates the fifth edition,\u201d says festival organiser Igor Jurilj. \u201cWe celebrate Joyce not only to commemorate his life and work in Croatia, but because he gave us textual lenses that open the eyes to the world, life and love. His mystified complexity is merely an idiosyncratic approach to everydayness we tend to misperceive or ignore.\u201d Santa Maria, Brazil Bloomsday celebrations have been running in the university city since 1994 through a series of poetry and prose readings, film screenings, debates and art exhibitions. This year, the 22nd Santa Maria Bloomsday, will start with excerpts and discussions at cultural organisation Cesma, with an exhibition and a celebration in traditional bar Ponto do Cinema that evening, featuring readings from Joyce, as well as Brazilian and Irish poetry, and Irish music. \u201cUlysses is an important book for me because it illustrates quite like how in every individual, as simple as it is, flourish the human mark. Each of us holds the legacy of all that humans came to achieve so far,\u201d says chairman Aguinaldo Medici Severino. Montreal, Canada Running from 12-16 June, Festival Bloomsday Montreal includes a musical gala, featuring songs the author loved, a dramatisation of the novel from the perspective of Molly Bloom, a pub quiz, dramatic readings, and a changing slate of pubs of the day. Spokesperson David Schurman points to Joyce\u2019s own comment about Ulysses, that \u201cI\u2019ve put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant.\u201d \u201cHe was so right about people like us spending inordinate amounts of time trying to figure out what Joyce was doing in Ulysses. All day Monday we\u2019ll be at the Canadian School of Irish Studies in Montreal hearing from the experts on Joyce. On Tuesday we have a large number of people from all walks of life reading from Ulysses in English, French and Irish. Nothing beats hearing the words being well read. Our closing features Kevin Birmingham, author 2014\u2019s The Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses,\u201d says Schurman. \u201cPubs, pub quiz, book bootleg, Molly Bloom soliloquy \u2013 we have it all at Festival Bloomsday Montr\u00e9al. Wish you were here.\u201d Philadelphia, US The Rosenbach Museum owns the manuscript of Ulysses in Joyce\u2019s hand, as well as first editions of the book, and has been celebrating Bloomsday for the past 23 years. This year it has a week-long festival, culminating tomorrow, and ranging from a crash course in the novel to a series of readings and performances, ending with Molly Bloom\u2019s soliloquy. \u201cBloomsday is a wonderful holiday for Joyceans around the world to celebrate the work of this incredible writer and storyteller,\u201d says Alice Emerson at the museum. \u201cBut, in some ways more importantly, it is also the perfect platform to introduce novices to the genius of Joyce\u2019s work. Here at the Rosenbach that has always been our primary objective: to give seasoned Ulysses readers a day of celebration, and to welcome all curious minds into Joyce\u2019s imaginative world. We\u2019ve given public readings of passages from Ulysses on Bloomsday since the beginning of our observance of the holiday, but we have also expanded our programming surrounding the day to offer multiple opportunities for people of all different comfort levels to engage with the story. The manuscript for Ulysses makes its home here, and as such a lynchpin of our collection, we are compelled by our mission to help make it accessible to all.\u201d China Berry, illustrator of a graphic novel adaptation  of Ulysses, has already lectured and exhibited his drawings this weekend in Shanghai\u2019s Fudan University and the Shanghai Grand Theatre. \u201cMy lecture and exhibit comes in the middle of an all-day tour of Joyce readings with students, professors and Irish literature enthusiasts here in the world\u2019s most populous city,\u201d he said. \u201cJoyce\u2019s work has been astoundingly successful here and I\u2019m happy for the chance to work with folks who are so enthusiastic for the material.\u201d     Great Wall of Words \u2026 China celebrates Bloomsday    He\u2019s then in Hong Kong for Bloomsday, where all-day readings are planned by students, professors and fans, as well as lectures on illustrating and adapting the author, before moving on to the Beijing Bookworm later this week. \u201cAll said and done, three of the most populous cities in the world will be talking about and celebrating James Joyce\u2019s novel this year and I think that\u2019s pretty exciting for a book many people claim they\u2019re afraid to read. As far as I know, this is still the only holiday to celebrate a single work of fiction. If it\u2019s so hard to read, then why are so many people the world over having so much fun with it?\u201d said Berry. Oslo, Norway It\u2019s the sixth year of Bloomsday celebrations in Oslo\u2019s Ibsen museum, with events tomorrow to include a lecture on Joyce and Yeats from University College Dublin\u2019s professor of Joyce studies Anne Fogarty, a one-man play The Dubliners\u2019 Dilemma, and later this week, the launch of a limited edition of Joyce\u2019s short story The Dead. People will be dressing up in Joycean garb, says organiser John Fitzgerald. \u201cOur mission statement is to open Joyce up to the general public and demysticise him,\u201d says Fitzgerald. \u201cUlysses is a very funny book \u2013 it\u2019s an everyman story, 24 hours, or a day in the life. Oslo also has an obvious connection \u2013 a very young Joyce corresponded with a very elderly Ibsen, and it\u2019s regarded as a seminal moment in Joyce\u2019s development.\u201d", "tags": ["James Joyce", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-15T15:35:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/thomas-cook-chinese-tourist-boom-fosun", "sentences": ["Fosun, which was founded by four university graduates in Shanghai in 1992, is one of China\u2019s largest conglomerates, with interests spanning banking, pharmaceuticals and mining."], "title": "Thomas Cook links up with Chinese company to profit from tourist boom", "article": "Thomas Cook is to launch a joint venture in China, as the tour operator seeks to capitalise on a tourism boom in one of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The Chinese recently overtook Americans as the world\u2019s biggest-spending tourists, splashing out $165bn (\u00a3106bn) in 2014, with more than 100 million people travelling abroad. Hong Kong and Macau remain the biggest holiday destinations for Chinese tourists, but Europe is popular among an affluent minority. In a bid to profit from that growing wanderlust, one of the world\u2019s oldest travel firms has unveiled a joint venture with Fosun International, one of China\u2019s largest conglomerates. Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, described the deal as a significant milestone. Thomas Cook said the joint venture would marry its \u201cbrand heritage and expertise in international travel\u201d with Fosun\u2019s \u201clocal market knowledge and operation resources\u201d. The two firms are putting in a combined \u00a31.6m to launch the venture, which will also sell internal tours. Thomas Cook, which began life in 1841 by selling rail excursions to a temperance rally in Loughborough, has been trying to reinvent its business for the internet age after it almost collapsed in 2012 following a slump in bookings. The firm hopes that the deal will allow it to develop upmarket hotels in China, which will be exclusive to Thomas Cook customers. Fosun, which was founded by four university graduates in Shanghai in 1992, is one of China\u2019s largest conglomerates, with interests spanning banking, pharmaceuticals and mining. In March, Fosun paid \u00a392m for a 5% stake in Thomas Cook, raising speculation of an eventual takeover. Fosun also bought the ailing French holiday company Club Med in February, having acquired a 7% stake in 2010.      Bicester\u2019s designer shopping outlet is particularly popular with Chinese tourists. Photograph: Andrew Fox    The joint venture could bring a wider range of holidays to China\u2019s burgeoning middle class. \u201cToday there is a lack of innovation and differentiation in the travel product offerings for Chinese tourists in China and abroad, presenting an excellent opportunity for our new joint venture to gain a competitive advantage,\u201d said Qian Jiannong, president of Fosun\u2019s tourism and commercial group. Wolfgang Georg Arlt, director of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, agreed there was \u201ctoo much run-of-the-mill stuff\u201d for Chinese tourists. He said that a second wave of Chinese tourists \u2013 younger, well educated and more likely to work for international companies \u2013 wanted bespoke holidays. \u201cThey are less interested in ticking off a list of famous places and more interested in doing things\u201d \u2013 such as learning local dances, taking cookery classes or going punting in Cambridge. But the \u201cfive countries in 10 days\u201d coach tours most associated with Chinese tourists in Europe are likely to remain popular. Stefanie Gallob, head of research at the European Travel Commission, said more Chinese tourists were travelling independently, but the market was likely to remain dominated by group travel for the medium term, because it was easier to obtain travel documents from Chinese authorities. \u201cIt is not a free travel market \u2013 it is a highly regulated and centralised market.\u201d France was named as the top \u201cdream destination\u201d in a survey of outbound Chinese tourists conducted by China Confidential, a research arm of the Financial Times. Italy was in second place, followed by the UK and Germany, although the top five countries actually visited were all in Asia. The UK, which is outside the EU\u2019s Schengen area of passport-free travel, attracts barely one-third of the tourists who went to France: between January and September 2014, 619,294 Chinese tourists visited France, but only 239,967 went to the UK, fewer than went to Switzerland, Germany or Russia. Last year, George Osborne announced that 25,000 Chinese tourists visiting the UK in organised groups could get their visa costs refunded, as the government seeks to entice more high-spending holidaymakers to visit Britain.

That would go a long way, after all, to explaining the success of Lululemon Athletica, the yoga apparel retailer founded by an Ayn Rand-loving billionaire who famously refused to stock clothing for plus-sized women. Avaricious capitalists certainly love to exploit the Age of Aquarius for the sake of money. As Michelle Goldberg points out in The Goddess Pose, however, that\u2019s not how it happened at all. Yoga in America, she writes, \u201cfirst took root among rather square elites and then spread to the counterculture before being reappropriated by the mainstream\u201d. In other words, the western version of yoga was originally less George Harrison and more Betty Draper. If it weren\u2019t for Indra Devi, the subject of The Goddess Pose, yoga might never have become a western craze at all. Devi, born Eugenia Vassilievna in 1899, wasn\u2019t the first yoga teacher in the United States, but she was undoubtedly the first successful one. When she taught her first American class in the late 1940s, yoga had a reputation stateside as being \u201cracy, disreputable, and perhaps a bit ridiculous\u201d. (This thanks to a series of moral panics and scandals surrounding yoga in the early 20th century.) The story of how Devi came to embrace yoga and spread its gospel in America is as fascinating as it is unlikely. She was born into Russian aristocracy, the daughter of a teenage mother who left her family at a young age to pursue a career as an actress. Devi held no grudge against her mother; the two reunited when Devi was a young woman. It was at the home of one of her mother\u2019s theater friends that Devi first encountered the term \u201chatha yoga\u201d. Her mother\u2019s friend tried to dissuade her from getting too excited \u2013 she shouldn\u2019t go to India, he told her. \u201cYou are too emotional, my dear.\u201d  The advice didn\u2019t take. Devi became a celebrated cabaret actress in Berlin, but her interest in Indian religion and philosophy never disappeared. In 1926, Devi traveled to Ommen, Holland, for a meeting of the Order of the Star in the East, a gathering of theosophists. Goldberg quotes the writer Rom Landau, describing the audience at one such event: \u201c[T]hey look deep into your eyes when they talk to you; they have a weakness for sandals \u2026 [and] for the rougher kind of textiles and such colours as mauve, bottle-green and purple. The men affect long hair, while the women kept theirs short.\u201d  Devi fell in love. She eventually relocated to India, where she met Jawaharlal Nehru, who told her that yoga saved his sanity when he was in prison. Not long after, she became a student of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, the legendary teacher often called \u201cthe father of modern yoga\u201d. Soon Devi found herself in Shanghai after her first husband, a Czech diplomat, was transferred to the city. She taught her first yoga classes in a small house owned by Madame Chiang Kai-shek. After the marriage dissolved, Devi moved to Los Angeles. \u201cBeginning anew was something she was extremely good at,\u201d Goldberg notes, and before long, she was teaching yoga to Greta Garbo, Jennifer Jones and Gloria Swanson. She married again, wrote a book called Yoga for Americans, and became a disciple of the controversial Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba. In 2002, she died in Buenos Aires at the age of 102.    Related: Zelig \u2013 review    As the foregoing illustrated, it\u2019s hard to condense Devi\u2019s life into a few paragraphs. She had a knack for being present at some of the 20th century\u2019s most iconic moments, so much so that Goldberg compares Devi to Zelig, the hero of the Woody Allen film of the same name, and to Forrest Gump. She was in Shanghai when the HMS Peterel was sunk on 8 December 1941 and in Dallas when John F Kennedy was assassinated on 22 November 1963. She met John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1970 (neither the musicians nor the yoga teacher were impressed), and played a bizarre part in Manuel Noriega\u2019s deposition from power in Panama in 1989. Yet there were also long gaps in her diaries and history when Devi was essentially unaccounted for. Still, Goldberg manages to create a remarkably coherent, fascinating narrative about her, emphasizing her ability to \u201csurvive her world\u2019s collapse by reinventing herself\u201d and her tendency to \u201cplay down her own misfortunes, casting a rosy, magical glow around her history\u201d. Goldberg, herself a yoga student, thankfully manages to avoid either lionizing or condemning Devi, who had as many faults as she had gifts \u2013 she essentially abandoned her second husband after he became ill, leaving him to die in a country he knew nothing about. It was a stunning act of cruelty, but Devi was always independent, and never let herself get dragged down by loyalty to family and friends. If it\u2019s true that enlightenment is non-attachment, Devi might have been one of the most enlightened people in the world. But Goldberg refuses to moralize \u2013 her goal in writing The Goddess Pose seems to have been not just chronicling the life of one of the world\u2019s great iconoclasts, but also providing a history for how hatha yoga went from an Indian spiritual tradition to an everyday part of western lives. She succeeds admirably on both counts, writing with understanding and a healthy sense of skepticism.  Indeed, the only hint of judgmentalism from Goldberg is in the book\u2019s title \u2013 ungenerous readers might wonder whether the author intended \u201cpose\u201d to have a meaning outside the literal one. Was Devi\u2019s career a pose, an act, a put-on? It\u2019s doubtful Goldberg meant that, though \u2013 whatever else was true about Devi, she was probably sincere, perhaps to a fault. \u201cThere is no such thing as unchanging authenticity,\u201d Goldberg writes.

Yu also needs medical treatment for kidney problems, although it was not clear if she had also been denied access to doctors. The couple were found guilty of illegally obtaining 256 items of information on Chinese citizens, including IDs, mobile phone numbers and travel records, after a one-day trial last August. Although officially an open prosecution, only relatives and consular officials were allowed into court for what was widely seen as a politically driven case. Humphrey was sentenced to two and a half years in jail and fined 200,000 yuan (\u00a320,260). His wife was sentenced to two years and fined 150,000 yuan. They were released early on medical grounds. The pair\u2019s sentences appeared to be unusual compared to previous ones, said Prof Don Clarke, a specialist in Chinese Law at George Washington University, in a posting on China Law Prof blog. Shanghai court records for 20 earlier prosecutions for trafficking private data showed that at least two people convicted of selling millions of pieces of information got only a suspended sentence and a small fine, he wrote. In one of the lowest volume comparable cases, where 4,619 pieces of information had been sold, the defendant was given only a 3,000 yuan fine. \u201cAt the very least, I think the burden is now on those who would assert that this case is not an outlier and possibly a case of selective prosecution,\u201d Clarke wrote, caveating that his assessment was based on preliminary information.    We have been absolutely shattered by what happened. It will take time to pick up the broken pieces.  Peter Humphrey     The couple\u2019s arrests sent chills through the foreign business community in China, as Humphrey and his wife were experienced and respected corporate investigators. He had been a Reuters foreign correspondent for nearly two decades and Yu was an accountant before they founded their company ChinaWhys in 2003. GSK had hired them to investigate why the company\u2019s then head of China operations, Mark Reilly, had been surreptitiously filmed having sex with his Chinese girlfriend in his guarded luxury home, a video sent to the company along with a slew of corruption allegations. As the investigation continued, however, Humphrey began to suspect that the accusations of fraud might be true. In the summer of 2013, authorities raided the GSK office, confiscating documents and detaining employees. Over six years, they said, GSK may have spent \u00a3285m on bribing doctors and hospital officials to sell its drugs.  Weeks later investigators targeted ChinaWhys, but the drugmaker has kept Humphrey and Yu at arm\u2019s length. GSK says the charges against Yu and Humphrey may not be related to GSK, and Chinese state media have never explicitly made the link. Throughout the fiasco, one figure has lurked in the background: Vivian Shi, GSK\u2019s former government relations manager. Reilly suspected she was the whistleblower, although she has denied it. Shi spent four years at the company, but left in December 2012, shortly before GSK executives began receiving the emails. She is supposedly well-connected in public security, and her father was a senior communist in Shanghai.   Related: China deports British investigator and wife linked to GSK corruption case    Shortly after Humphrey\u2019s detention, a video of him apparently \u201cconfessing\u201d in a police station, was broadcast on national TV, an extremely unusual treatment of a foreigner. Humphrey said that despite the televised statement he had always refused to plead guilty in court to the offences he was charged with, frustrating his captors. \u201cNeither I nor Ying have ever admitted any guilt as charged. We were not guilty of the offences with which we were charged and convicted, but my health was held hostage to signing such a confession. I never signed an admission of crime,\u201d Humphrey said in response to Guardian questions that were passed on to him by a family friend. The couple are now seeking medical attention as soon as possible and are trying to piece their lives back together after nearly two years behind bars, with limited communication with the outside world and in cells so cramped and overcrowded they sometimes had to sleep on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to finally get out of captivity,\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cWe have been absolutely shattered by what happened.

This cost included $374 for consultations (after the first visit he was instructed to return morning and night for two days for intravenous fluids), $174 for admission to the general ward for observation; and $366 for ibuprofen, cough syrup and two antibiotics. A grand total, when added to my mother\u2019s bill, of $2,983.93. \u201cIf you are ever go on a cruise, for God\u2019s sake make sure you have travel insurance, and take a good selection of medications with you,\u201d my father said. Other hidden costs can include the cost of off-board excursions organised by the cruise ship, alcohol costs and the ship\u2019s phone. \u201cIncoming calls were $9 a minute charged to the caller,\u201d my father said. \u201cSo you order a beer for $11; your bill comes and it\u2019s actually $13 because they charge 18% gratuities on top of the service,\u201d he added.

We should be sworn enemies by now. Instead, we head a business with 40 staff, offices in the UK and Asia Pacific and an annual turnover of \u00a3200m.  We had no idea it would turn out like that. When we started Astus in 2003, the conditions could hardly have been worse. Our business operates in the niche media barter sector which, put simply, allows advertisers to use their products or services to pay for part of their media campaigns. Twelve years ago media barter in the UK had a terrible reputation and Paul and I, both working for a US media barter company, felt it could be done differently. That brings me to my first tip for doing business with friends. Launch a crusade   Related: Happy birthday: why three is a magic number for entrepreneurs    Initially, Paul and I tried to persuade our employer to adopt a new business model that focused on giving advertisers the media they wanted before asking them to pay for it. We spent two days presenting it to our bosses in New York \u2013 they said no.  That should have been the end of it, but neither of us could let it go. For us, launching our own business wasn\u2019t a choice, it was a compulsion. I\u2019m convinced that without our shared crusading zeal \u2013 we have strong views on the direction of the company and its values \u2013 our business would never have got off the ground.  Work together first Paul and I had been colleagues for almost four years in a competitive environment before launching Astus so we knew a lot about each other\u2019s professional strengths and weaknesses and how we cope with pressure. (Paul is calm and collected.) Crucially, we knew we could rely on each other. Research by Harvard Business School professor Noam Wasserman into nearly 10,000 founders of technology startups, found that the least stable founding teams were friends. He also found that the most stable teams were former colleagues.    When it comes down to it, which of you is really in charge?    Don\u2019t separate the personal from the professional We jointly funded most of the investment required to launch Astus, which was considerable. When you are friendsand have life savings invested in a business, it\u2019s all personal, so why pretend otherwise? Although we are not afraid to challenge each other on decisions, we do have a rule about not disagreeing in front of the team. This has led to a few shouting matches in the street!  We know immediately if something is bothering the other and support each other if any personal issues arise so they don\u2019t affect our work.  Carve out clear roles from the start If you\u2019ve never worked together, translating what you know about your friend\u2019s skills from a social context into a business one is tough. And when it comes down to it, which of you is really in charge? Paul and I have been strategic about how we have divide our responsibilities.  I\u2019m opinionated, gregarious and love networking, so it made sense for me to have a client-facing role and be the public face of the company as CEO. Paul is fantastic at running the team and getting the best out of them. He is also good with numbers so he is in charge of doing deals and is our COO. In practice, we consult on all the big decisions and trust each other\u2019s judgment 100%.  Have an exit plan This is probably number one on the to-do list if you are going into business with friends. A good exit plan should allow for different scenarios \u2013 from one of you wanting out to what happens if the business fails. I doubt many friendships survive a business going under, but having a clear exit strategy will make things less painful. Ours is outlined in our shareholder agreement. Take a \u2018for better or worse\u2019 approach Launching a new business with a friend is a bit like deciding to get married. Before saying \u201cI do\u201d it\u2019s worth asking some of the same questions you would of a prospective life partner: can I tolerate their foibles day in, day out? Is our relationship strong enough to weather the stress and uncertainty of this new challenge?  Low points for us include me being struck down by poisoning and Paul having to drive me from the Lake District to London, stopping to make a crucial work call while I was being sick in a layby. Highlights include sharing a cold beer after a good day\u2019s work in Hong Kong, Sydney or Shanghai, knowing we have built a team and a business we\u2019re proud of.

Cool. Here\u2019s more of what could be called a thing happening. After Milan had their pants pulled right down to their ankles by neighbours Inter over Geoffrey Kondogbia, it looks like they\u2019ve been gazumped again, this time by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for the striker Jackson Mart\u00ednez, with the Colombian set to move from Porto, according to his agent who apologised with the philosophical musing that you \u201ccan\u2019t be in two places at once.\u201d Of course this is being spun as a snub for Arsenal, despite little suggestion that they were ever really terribly interested in Mart\u00ednez, or indeed a striker of any stripe.  Anyway, back to ephemera, and according to whispers in Spain, Manchester United have another suitor for their wayward winger \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, purchased last year at great expense but now seemingly on his way out of England in a sack. And that sack has a little tag on it, the sending address reading \u2018FC Barcelona, Camp Nou, Camp Nou Mews, 1 Barcelona Street, Barcelona,  Spain  Cataluyna.\u2019 No postcode though, so it might not get there for a bit.  Meanwhile, emissaries from Chelsea and Stoke have been meeting over a bowl of chips at the Daventry Harvester (we\u2019re guessing \u2013 it\u2019s roughly equidistant between London and Stoke, and they do a fine bowl of chips) to discuss the transfer of Asmir Begovic, and a solemn air has descended over proceedings. For the party from the Potteries have just made their demands, pausing and adopting a serious tone before saying something like: \u201cNow, if these talks are to continue, we must make clear what we want. As well as the \u00a38m, we have to insist that you include \u2026 [dramatic, portentous pause] Victor Moses in the deal as well.\u201d To which the Chelsea officials presumably tried not to crack a grin, nodded sagely, looked at each other like Seth Johnson and his agent when faced with Peter Ridsdale*, sucked in their teeth, briefly made noises about those being tough terms before finally admitting: \u201cWe\u2019re sure we can work something out.\u201d Should that price be just too steep for Chelsea, Stoke are keen on Yevhen Konoplyanka to fill one of their wing slots. Steve McClaren has barely had time to locate the umbrella rack at Newcastle before cracking out the cheque-book, and according to the ever-infallible word on the street, he\u2019s going to scribble out a big fat one, to the tune of \u00a314m, for QPR\u2019s Charlie Austin. Whether Austin himself will want to swap one tin repository for another is another question entirely. Elsewhere in the north east, Sunderland are going to spend \u00a311m on Georginio Wijnaldum, a thought most depressing for any PSV or indeed Dutch fans out there; you can take it when Manchester United prove too much of a draw for Memphis Depay, but when Sunderland are sashaying away with your best players \u2026 eesh. The Mackems, however, haven\u2019t had such luck with a \u00a35m bid for Stewart Downing, rejected by West Ham, who themselves will guff \u00a312m on Marseille\u2019s Dimitri Payet and have told Andy Carroll that he ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere, potentially in the form of a mournful country song.

Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being\u00a0nonexistent persons.\u201d Of course, lottery prizes in 2015 are not an Orwellian scam ... are they? Our chances are tiny but not zero \u2026 aren\u2019t they?

And while the worse off might develop a damaging lottery habit, for the prosperous middle classes, putting a tenner or 20 quid on the lottery for a laugh is a vanishingly small bet. Once again, the national lottery proves that George Orwell\u2019s vision is alive and well. Dog days for Johnny Depp   We are living through a diplomatic crisis. Actor Amber Heard has just icily announced that she and her husband, Johnny Depp, are boycotting Australia. This is because Depp was told by the Australian authorities in May that they might destroy his Yorkshire terriers Pistol and Boo when he brought them into the country illegally. They finally got out unscathed, but Heard now furiously blames Australia\u2019s agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce for making political capital from their dog-loving agony, and has announced she and Depp would \u201cavoid the land down under from now on\u201d. That\u2019s a bit tame compared with Frank Sinatra\u2019s Australian standoff in 1974. On stage in Melbourne he called that nation\u2019s female journalists \u201cbuck-and-a-half hookers\u201d. His refusal to apologise resulted in patriotic fury and a refuelling ban on his private jet by airport unions. Sinatra was stranded in his hotel, an indefinite house arrest that only ended after future prime minister Bob Hawke came to his suite to broker a peace agreement. Let\u2019s see Johnny, Amber, Pistol and Boo come to Australia and denounce Joyce from the stage of\u00a0the\u00a0Melbourne Festival Hall. Orson\u2019s white Othello   This is Orson Welles\u2019s centenary year, and his body of work is now being picked over with documentaries, re-releases and reassessments. But on\u00a0one part of his CV, silence reigns.   Related: Should white actors be able to play Othello? Perhaps, but don\u2019t black up    I was reminded of this when Steven Berkoff sounded off on the subject of an alleged political correctness which prevents white actors playing Othello. He mentioned Laurence Olivier in blackface as the Moor: a performance habitually treated with warily respectful embarrassment. But Olivier was not cinema\u2019s only white Othello. Welles took the role himself on screen, as producer-director-star in a 1952 movie that was a resounding critical success: he shared the top prize at the Cannes film festival with it and undoubtedly considered his Othello a serious career achievement. Now it\u2019s as if it never happened. No digital restorations, no DVD reissues and at this year\u2019s Cannes, despite reverent screenings of Citizen Kane, The Third Man and The Lady from Shanghai, there was zero mention of Othello \u2013 which the festival itself had garlanded. Well, despite the discomfort of watching any white actor in blackface, it must be said it\u2019s a stylish and exciting film of its time. Welles is better than Olivier: more relaxed, more physical.

CCA, Tue to 5 Jul  Orson Welles: The Great Disruptor, London As one observer puts it in a new documentary, Welles was simply not a Hollywood film-maker: too radical, too innovative, too single-minded, some might say.

Analysts said rocketing share values on China\u2019s main stock markets, including Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, were the result of a switch away from property investment following a clampdown by the government on excessive lending by banks. Laws liberalising the stock market also made it easier for funds to invest and for firms to offer shares to the public for the first time. The last six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges. According to Reuters data, in the first two weeks of this month around 1.4 million new investors a week flocked to the stock market, helping pump up prices.  Diana Choyleva, a renowned China analyst at Lombard Street Research, said Beijing viewed a stock market bubble as preferable to a housing market bubble. The authorities have clamped down on lending to property developers and households keen to get on the property ladder to prevent an already soaring market getting out of control. \u201cProperty price inflation is more dangerous because it is socially divisive, increasing the wealth of the rich while making it even harder for the less fortunate to clamber onto the property ladder,\u201d she said. China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, intervened to say the economy\u2019s fundamentals were good and major indicators were improving. He told the state-owned China Central Television that the cooling property sector had slowed growth, but \u201cthe main economic indicators such as industrial output, investment, consumption, exports and imports have stabilised and showed improvements since May.\u201d Further falls in China stocks are expected to send ripples throughout Asian markets, according to the investment advisor Rivkin.

In a brief televised address to the nation, Tsipras threw the blame onto the leaders of the eurozone. But he did not say how long the banks would remain shut, nor did he give details of how much individuals and companies would be allowed to withdraw once they reopened. All over Athens people queued at cash machines, particularly outside National Bank branches because the National Bank supplies the banknotes, and lots of other Greek banks, by midnight on Sunday, had no more of those.         Alexis Tsipras addresses the nation.     Other European banks have limited exposure to Greece.

By calling a referendum, Syriza has gambled that it can strengthen its hand in negotiations with its lenders. But with no extension to its bailout programme, and emergency funds from the European Central Bank (ECB) on a knife-edge, the move has prompted this week\u2019s \u201cbank holiday\u201d and the rationing of cash at ATMs. With the opposition and business groups warning of economic catastrophe, Syriza \u2013 which means \u201ccoalition of the radical left\u201d \u2013 faces a nailbiting week. What is at stake is whether this party of around 20,000 members can hold the left half of Greek society together long enough to force the lenders to negotiate \u2013 or whether it will crash and burn under the pressure of popular anger and disillusion. If they win, on the other hand, they will be seen as heroes by opponents of austerity across Europe. But win or lose, Syriza in office has been a work in progress, impossible to read for people ignorant of Greece, let alone people who don\u2019t know there are subcategories to moderate Marxism.     People wait outside a closed National Bank of Greece branch in Athens. Photograph: Yannis Kolesidis/EPA    Greece under austerity has become frenetic. Athens right now is slick with perspiration; every public space is charged with hormonal tension and political disagreement \u2013 even the bakery where you buy your morning bread. The politics are brutal. Last week, stick-wielding anarchist youths attacked the HQ of the Antarsya \u2013 a far-left anti-capitalist party \u2013 because the latter had tried to make them pay to go into a music festival when the anarchists thought it should be free. I\u2019ve seen, in the bohemian Exarchia district, a troupe of black-clad 15-year-olds distrupt a whole street full of similarly bohemian cafe-goers on a Saturday night, using petrol bombs and flaming rubbish bins, simply because \u201ccreating mayhem\u201d is their doctrine.   Related: Greece's euro-referendum: 100 Greeks give their view    Athens has become, in short, the stage for flamboyant acts of self-dramatisation: sporadic riots, public kissing, street theatre and ill-advised scooter techniques. It is, to use a phrase Huxley once used about Shanghai, \u201clife with the lid off\u201d, and for the same reasons: \u201cso much life, so carefully canalised, so rapidly and strongly flowing\u201d. Antonis Vradis, a geographer at Durham University who has studied the impact of repeated waves of unrest here since 2008, describes how the youth networks have been preparing for this week\u2019s \u201crupture\u201d with the ECB: \u201cThey are creating structures you can\u2019t default on. Self-organised clinics, the social centres you see all around you. Structures that will help them survive.\u201d I meet Vradis in Floral cafe on the corner of Exarchia Square. He points out that the building \u2013 shabby as it is now \u2013 is a Bauhaus masterpiece. More importantly, during the 1944 uprising against the British, \u201cthe communists were snipers on the roof\u201d. The young here live always with a portion of their brain operating in the past. They don\u2019t need wall plaques. When they move through Exarchia, or Syntagma, or up the side of parliament towards the mansion prime minister Alexis Tsipras now occupies, they can \u201csee\u201d where the resistance fighters died; where the students of 1974 stopped a tank.     Alexis Tsipras in parliament. Photograph: NurPhoto/Rex Shutterstock    It was the young people radicalised amid this landscape who pitched a tent camp outside parliament in 2011. They organised a movement most foreign journalists didn\u2019t see: local assemblies in small squares across the city and its suburbs, where young mums, migrants and outraged pensioners could have their say. The communists denounced them; the socialists sent riot police to disperse them; Tsipras is said to have looked out of the window of his office and delared: those are the people who will put us into power. But Syriza is different. Syriza is a coalition whose colours are red for socialism, green for ecology and purple for feminism. But it is primarily red. It was born out of Eurocommunism \u2013 when the communist parties of the west declared loyalty to parliamentary democracy instead of Moscow. Its most influential activists are aged 50 and above: people who have read all three volumes of Karl Marx\u2019s Capital, plus the Grundrisse, Theories of Surplus Value and Friedrich Engels\u2019 Anti-D\u00fchring. A lot of them are MPs now, or special advisers: you\u2019ll find them in greying huddles in their old haunts \u2013 the radical bars and cafes of Exarchia and Plaka. How this generation of Greek leftwingers broke out of isolation is of more than academic interest. They have managed \u2013 for the first time in modern history \u2013 to form a government that defied the global finance system, and to do so with flair. Their strength was that they understood the significance of the youth revolts of 2008 and 2011. Some pitched their own tents in Syntagma Square and were tear-gassed out of it. But in the process, the party built something more official and resilient.     Syriza supporters in 2014. Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP    Their weakness, it turns out, starts with Nicos Poulantzas. Poulantzas was a Greek intellectual of the new left who famously clashed with Ed Miliband\u2019s father, Ralph, in 1969 over the nature of the capitalist state. Miliband said the state was \u201ccapitalist\u201d because personally controlled by the business elite. Poulantzas said the state was structurally capitalist \u2013 independent of the will of individuals. Poulantzas evolved a dual strategy for the Greek left in the 1970s: first, to encircle the state with social movements, which were not to be controlled by any party but allowed to become expressions of popular democracy. And at the same time, to enter the state, democratise it and use it to pursue social justice. Poulantzas killed himself in 1979, but his ideas guided the precursor organisation to Syriza. Not many people remember now, but the party\u2019s predecessor, Synaspismos, joined a short-lived coalition government with the conservatives in 1988, and a national government thereafter.     Nikos Poulantzas. Photograph: Sophie Bassouls/Sygma/Corbis    In the runup to its election victory, Syriza got a chance to execute the Poulantzas strategy of the march through the state: it won the Euro elections and the vital prefecture of Attica, where its candidate was protest veteran Rena Dourou. Then it won state power \u2013 but that has turned out differently. When Tsipras took over the Maximos Mansion, the PM\u2019s residence, the outgoing government removed all computers and all soap. There is soap now, and computers, though no Wi-Fi for security reasons. Tsipras rules from one side of a marble hall; the other side is the cabinet room. In the basement are secure meeting rooms and offices. At the weekend, you will often find somebody\u2019s children crayoning on the floor. The ceremonial guards, in their white tunics, sip freddo-cappuccino on a narrow terrace, alongside press photographers and armed bodyguards. In power, Syriza has discovered the unguessed secret of the Greek state. Without oligarchs, it is inefficient. So thoroughly did the old parties use patronage to run the operation that they barely needed a civil service, or the shock absorbers provided by independent regulators and quangos normal in a state such as Britain. I have seen ministers confronted with ridiculously detailed operational decisions, such as the appointment of a new boss for the state TV channel, which in Britain would be delegated to a regulator, but in Greece fell to minister of state Nikos Pappas. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis routinely handles his own press: though he has press officers drawn from Syriza, the actual press operation of the Greek state is barely engaged. Yannis Dragasakis, Greece\u2019s deputy prime minister, was in many ways the embodiment of Syriza\u2019s long-term dreams. His team of advisers included those most attuned to the \u201chorizontalist\u201d agenda emerging out of the networked social movements; people whose main desire was to nurture the 70-plus small-scale economic experiments they had promoted: local currencies, Wi-Fi networks in the mountains, producer co-ops. But Dragasakis was given \u201coperations\u201d: to operate the government, to firefight the banking system, to sort out the state energy company. Those who expected his department to unleash a wave of entrepreneurship and experimental projects have had to wait.     Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Photograph: Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP    Probably the most challenging job in Greek journalism right now is to work for Avgi, Syriza\u2019s newspaper. It is a daily, with professional graphic design, but suffers because nobody can decide whether it is meant to carry the party line or to be a voice for the mass base, and therefore a pain in Tsipras\u2019s butt. When I meet editor-in-chief Giorgos Kiritsis, he is surrounded, almost symbolically, by fading newsprint and old posters. He chain-smokes and pulls up a Facebook page on which someone has posted a 50,000 drachma note with Kiritsis\u2019s face on. Nobody knows what 50,000 drachmas will be worth if Greece defaults on its debts, but Kiritsis and his colleagues have for months been exposed to the basic dilemma of Syriza. It is a coalition \u2013 including the hard, pro-Moscow left who want that drachma note to become real; a centre around Tsipras who wanted to try to shrug off austerity within the euro; and former social democrats who want, at all costs, to do a deal with the lenders. It was not until 4 June that Tsipras became convinced that his original strategy \u2013 to go on paying the lenders while negotiating the fine detail of an accord that never seemed to come \u2013 was fruitless. It was at this point that the forces in Syriza realigned leftwards and the strategy of the troika (the ECB, IMF and European Commission) \u2013 which had always been to split Syriza, forcing Tsipras and his own moderates into a coalition government with the centre parties \u2013 was in tatters. The ultimate question for Syriza, with the banks closed and the referendum due, is: can it now function as a movement? It has ridden to power on the back of social movements but, unlike Podemos in Spain or Sinn F\u00e9in in Ireland, has never really been a mass movement itself.     Graffiti in Athens. Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP    In the middle-class suburb of Chalandri in northern Athens, the mayor, Simos Roussos, has to organise the referendum and simultaneously keep the machinery of government going. Roussos was elected on a joint slate between Syriza and Antarsya party. He tells me the council\u2019s gas supplier refused a delivery on Monday \u2013 not on the grounds that he wouldn\u2019t get paid, but on the grounds that he didn\u2019t like what Syriza is doing. We meet at a council-run clinic where, after midday, the official GPs and psychiatrists give way to a team of volunteers. It is run this way because the austerity under the previous govenrment means they can\u2019t staff the clinic with paid employees. The volunteers include doctors, psychologists and qualified pharmacists, but I find them engaged in the menial task of hand-sorting donated medicines. They note the sell-by dates, count the pills and sort them. This is Syriza\u2019s mass base \u2013 but it is not Syriza. Syriza was always a party before it was a movement. The early polls taken since the referendum was called indicate it still has mass support. The unanswered question is whether it can hold the leftwing half of Greek society together amid this week of chaos. Nineta, one of the volunteers at the clinic, tells me people are frightened, but that she is totally behind what Syriza has done. The antidote to fear is solidarity, she says. But nobody is sure how much solidarity can survive if the banks stay closed.", "tags": ["Syriza", "Eurozone crisis", "Greece", "World news", "Europe", "Economics", "Financial crisis", "Euro", "Business", "Eurozone"], "publicationDate": "2015-06-29T17:45:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jun/29/greek-referendum-a-yes-vote-would-be-messy-a-no-even-messier", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Composite fell another 3.3% and the Shenzhen index lost 6.1%."], "title": "Greek referendum: a yes vote would be messy, a no vote even messier", "article": "Referendums settle matters definitively, right?

A yes vote \u2013 the more likely outcome, according to the polls \u2013 would mean the fall of the Syriza-led government.  Prime minister Alexis Tsipras would have led negotiations his party regards as a failure. He would have campaigned for rejection of the creditors\u2019 proposals. He would have lost, in Brussels and at home. A general election would follow. But what government would be elected, and what happens while it is formed?  A nightmarish outcome, in the eyes of Brussels and Berlin, would see Syriza returned, which is not inconceivable because the Greek opposition is divided and the electoral system awards extra seats to the largest party. But even if a pro-EU centrist alliance were to prevail in a general election, the talking would have to start afresh. The creditors, one assumes, would be honour-bound to offer the same terms as those that were on the table last week.  But the add-on, Greeks might reasonably assume, would be debt relief \u2013 since Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, hinted at it in his meandering appeal for a yes vote. But agreement on debt relief among the creditors is probably not going to happen quickly or easily. The question has been dodged consistently over the past six months despite the prodding of the International Monetary Fund.  Eurozone hardliners, after a yes vote, might argue that such a politically toxic issue can be deferred yet again to keep non-Greek electorates sweet. Cue deeper resentment in Greece after a summer of disruption and capital controls. A no vote would be even messier. Syriza would still be in power but Tsipras would not be offered more generous bailout terms.  But nor \u2013 presumably \u2013 would he think he has a mandate to lead Greece out of the eurozone. He has insisted that the 5 July referendum is on the narrow technical question of whether to accept last week\u2019s proposals. In that case, other eurozone leaders, if they mean what they say about a no vote implying exit from the single currency, would have to find a way to expel Greece.  The quickest route would be for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut off all support for Greek banks, creating chaos on the ground. At that point, US politicians might be unable to contain their frustration. They might be screaming at their European counterparts to find a way to avoid a crisis that could spill into the entire eurozone and inflame tensions in Ukraine. Monday\u2019s reaction in financial markets was mild. Share prices fell across Europe but not wildly.  Yields on Spanish, Italian and Portuguese debt rose but remain miles away from crisis levels. Investors were already thinking of their comfort blanket \u2013 intervention by the ECB if the Greek plot turns nasty. It is clearly possible that relative calm can last until Sunday and beyond. But it seems unlikely: stock markets have a long record of underestimating political risks until they materialise. Growing concern in the US should be ringing alarms. Chinese stock panic A bad reason for a central bank to cut interest rates is to prop up a falling stock market. The People\u2019s Bank of China would never admit that was its game as it cut lending rates for the fourth time since November.  But, to the outside world, this was no coincidence: share prices had fallen 20% in two weeks, including a big whack on Friday, and Beijing felt it had to act. If that was the thinking, it backfired. The Shanghai Composite fell another 3.3% and the Shenzhen index lost 6.1%. Tomorrow is another day, but the danger in intervention is obvious. If it works, investors believe they have a licence to speculate, creating perfect conditions for a bubble. If it fails, a central bank looks powerless.  In this case, the Chinese also look panicked. Local share prices, even after the falls of the past few weeks, are still up by almost a third since January. What\u2019s the problem supposed to be? 100% certainty Martin Weale would like members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to have 100 votes, not just one, so they can better express the nuance of their views on interest rates.  The idea will never be adopted, of course, and thank goodness. Harry Truman had it right: \u201cGive me a one-handed economist.

The 25-year-old is definitely available but could cost as much as \u00a315m and has already been linked with approximately half the Premier League, with Newcastle, Southampton, West Ham and Chelsea the most frequently recurring names. Talking of West Ham, Slaven Bilic\u2019s contract stipulates that if the new manager guides them to relegation he can be sacked without notice or compensation, and also that he won\u2019t qualify for a bonus unless the Hammers finish the season in the top eight.

Boro obviously have some money to spend despite their narrow failure to win promotion to the Premier League, and in addition to Downing are also linked to the Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci, who is likely to cost around \u00a31.7m.

In London-based top-flight club midfield news, Arsenal have suddenly gone off Arturo Vidal and are determined to sign William Carvalho, star of Portugal\u2019s European Under-21 Championship success, instead. And Internazionale could come a-calling for Chelsea\u2019s Mikel John Obi, but only if they can\u2019t sign Galatasaray\u2019s Felipe Melo, who they think is better. Defender latest: Sergio Ramos is still angling to move to Manchester United (and no surprise either if rumours of a \u00a3230,000-a-week contract offer are to be believed), and Roma\u2019s 31-year-old Greek defender Jos\u00e9 Holebas is apparently a \u00a32m target for Watford.

The bad news is that Roma can\u2019t afford his \u00a320m asking price \u2013 they want Manuel Pellegrini to accept the Serbian midfielder Adem Ljajic in part-exchange.

It was August 2013, weeks after his arrival at Tottenham Hotspur from Corinthians, and he was reflecting on his first foray into European football, as a 19-year-old at FC Vilnius in Lithuania, when he suffered racial abuse from supporters and questioned whether he wanted to carry on in football. The circumstances are different now \u2013 happily \u2013 and yet Paulinho might find resonance in that feeling of bewilderment, of the erosion of the conviction that he has held in his ability. The questions are coming thick and fast for the 26-year-old. How did he come to endure such a nightmarish season at Tottenham last time out? Did it begin with his toils for Brazil at the World Cup the previous summer? And, above all, China? Why China?   Related: Paulinho makes \u00a39.9m switch from Tottenham to Guangzhou Evergrande    Paulinho has completed an eye-opening \u00a310m move to Guangzhou Evergrande, the reigning Chinese Super League champions and one of the powerhouses of Asian football. They are chasing their fifth consecutive domestic title and are in the quarter-finals of the Asian Champions League \u2013 the competition they won in 2013 under Marcello Lippi. Yet it says much for Paulinho\u2019s current standing in the game that many Tottenham fans have lauded their chairman, Daniel Levy, as a magician for not only removing the player\u2019s \u00a355,000-a-week wage from the club\u2019s books but for receiving such a healthy fee for him. It still represents a loss on the \u00a317m or so that Tottenham pledged to Corinthians but, frankly, nobody saw eight figures coming back for Paulinho. It is a far cry from the excitement that surrounded his arrival in London. Tottenham were acquiring a Copa Libertadores and Club World Cup winner \u2013 Paulinho played well in Corinthians\u2019 victory over Chelsea in the final in December 2012 \u2013 and a burgeoning force on the international scene. Paulinho had scored against England at the Maraca\u00f1a in June 2013 and been an important part of the Brazil team that won the Confederations Cup a few weeks later.

Villas-Boas started Paulinho in each one of his Premier League fixtures that season, up to and including the 5-0 home defeat against Liverpool in mid-December, after which the manager was sacked. Paulinho was sent off in that game for a high boot on Luis Su\u00e1rez. Villas-Boas used Paulinho as a No8 and his performances were solid enough \u2013 nothing outstanding but generally worth a six or seven out of 10. Paulinho was a disciplined part of Villas-Boas\u2019s system and he tried to inject urgency. Yet the criticism, which would harden over the remainder of Paulinho\u2019s White Hart Lane career, was that he habitually failed to stand out. There is precious little by which to remember his time in English football \u2013 save, perhaps, the wonderful backheeled winner in the last minute at Cardiff City in September 2013. The supporters saw him play and yet they never really saw him play. When Villas-Boas\u2019s successor, Tim Sherwood, bemoaned how many of the squad\u2019s players were \u201cmuch of a muchness,\u201d Paulinho was prominent in his thoughts. Sherwood could not be accused of mothballing him. After Paulinho had served his suspension for the red card against Liverpool, Sherwood brought him back into the starting line-up against Stoke City. Unfortunately Paulinho was crocked by Charlie Adam and ruled out for one month. When fit, though, Sherwood once again restored him straight away and, apart from a spell in March 2014, he always started him in the league. Sherwood\u2019s successor, Mauricio Pochettino, did not and Paulinho\u2019s woes came to follow a chicken-and-egg-style downward spiral, related to a lack of opportunity and loss of confidence. He had returned late after the World Cup, in which he struggled and lost his place in Luiz Felipe Scolari\u2019s preferred Brazil XI while he was involved, as a half-time substitute, in the 7-1 semi-final defeat by Germany, which has scarred a nation. Paulinho did not kick a ball for Tottenham in pre-season and there was the sense that he had lost ground under Pochettino \u2013 another new manager. Even his mate, Sandro, would leave for Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the summer transfer window. Whereas Paulinho was on the back foot, others \u2013 namely Ryan Mason \u2013 had hit the ground running. Mason impressed Pochettino during pre-season and his emergence served to press Paulinho down the midfield pecking order. Paulinho started only three league games under Pochettino and in one of them \u2013 Burnley away in early April \u2013 there was the nadir, the dreadful moment when an international-class footballer came to resemble a park player. Paulinho\u2019s fractured rhythm and self-belief were laid bare when he miscued a shot so horribly that the travelling fans were caught between laughter and tears. In the end they settled for hands-on-head amazement.         Paulinho\u2019s embarrassing miss for Tottenham against Burnley    The capture of Paulinho is a tonic not only for Guangzhou but for the Chinese League, which is flexing its financial muscle. Paulinho has signed a four-year contract, improving his salary handsomely, and it is doubtful whether too many realistic suitors in mainland Europe or South America could have matched the offer. Scolari, who was appointed as Fabio Cannavaro\u2019s managerial successor at Guangzhou in early June, has used his personal connection with Paulinho to smooth the deal. Scolari\u2019s comments two weeks ago, though, were revealing. \u201cI knew that China was spending a lot to improve its football and Guangzhou is one of the pioneers,\u201d he said. The club spent a record \u00a310.6m on the Brazilian striker, Ricardo Goulart, in January; Demba Ba, meanwhile, has just joined Shanghai Shenhua, Didier Drogba\u2019s old club, for an undisclosed fee. Paulinho was well liked within the club at Tottenham. He was a quiet and extremely religious family man and his professionalism was not questioned. His English was passable and he understood everything clearly. It was not that he failed to settle, rather that he could not make his mark. Not for the first time Paulinho must start again.", "tags": ["Tottenham Hotspur", "Brazil", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-01T13:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/02/minority-and-indigenous-communities-turned-off-own-land-in-growing-numbers", "sentences": ["The UN has predicted that about 40 \u201cmegacities\u201d, each with a population of 10 million-plus, will exist by 2030, with Delhi, Shanghai and Tokyo among the most populated."], "title": "Minority and indigenous communities turned off own land in growing numbers", "article": "From the stateless Rohingya escaping oppression at the hands of Burma\u2019s government to the Yazidis fleeing advancing Islamic State fighters in Iraq, more indigenous peoples and minority groups are being displaced from their land and pushed into cities, where they face discrimination, a study has warned. The displacement of minority and native groups has risen over the past year, Minority Rights Group International (MRG) said in its latest report. The growing threat of violence and persecution is most vividly illustrated by the terrors the Islamic State has inflicted upon the Yazidi religious group in northern Iraq.  \u201cThe situation looks pretty dire if you look back at the last 12 or 18 months, particularly with the catastrophic situation facing religious minorities in the Middle East and the large-scale displacement of minority communities like the Yazidis out of Iraq,\u201d said Carl Soderbergh, director of policy at MRG. \u201cSome of the smaller minority communities may no longer even be present in the countries where they\u2019ve resided for millennia,\u201d he added.  The hunt for natural resources is also fuelling the displacement of indigenous peoples, according to the study. In Colombia, people of African ancestry have been forced off their land by armed groups seeking to control gold mines, and the majority of Canada\u2019s First Nations people now live in urban areas because they have been forced off their rural land by mining operations, the report said. Greater monitoring of the displacement caused by natural resource extraction is needed, Soderbergh said. \u201cThere must be meaningful participation of indigenous peoples and the right to free, prior and informed consent when companies go in to extract natural resources.\u201d The report\u2019s authors also criticised the failure of governments to involve communities in their policymaking processes. \u201cUnfortunately, minorities and indigenous peoples still are not at the negotiating tables \u2013 they\u2019re not in the rooms where decisions are taking place,\u201d said Soderbergh. The report highlighted countries where government persecution has threatened minority groups and indigenous peoples. In China, the government destroyed Uyghur traditional housing in Kashgar, raising the prospect of violence in the region, Soderbergh said. Urbanisation across the world has made it harder than ever for governments, urban planners and civil society to protect the rights of minority groups and indigenous peoples in cities. Minorities who arrive in cities often live in informal settlements and can face police harassment and ghettoisation, the report warned. Soaring populations and a lack of rural development is driving record numbers of people to urban centres. The UN has said that two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will live in cities by 2050. Benson Solit, 25, is a Sengwer from Kenya\u2019s Embobut forest. He left his hometown in 2014, when the Sengwer were violently evicted from their land by forest service guards. At the time, the government said the evictions were a necessary measure to protect local water supplies.  Solit was forced to flee to Kenya\u2019s teeming capital, Nairobi, where he now lives in an informal settlement. \u201cI don\u2019t really feel safe in Nairobi; we have some worries and I don\u2019t feel comfortable,\u201d he said, adding that he missed his home in the forest. However, he said he was enrolled in college and does odd jobs to make ends meet. Solit\u2019s story is similar to those of people from other groups around the world, many of whom have been forced to leave their land and, lacking other options, ventured to cities. The Kenyan government has projected that Nairobi\u2019s population could rise from its current level of about 3.5 million people to 18.5 million by 2030 (pdf). Resettled minority groups and indigenous peoples usually move to the slums of large cities, which are plagued by poor urban planning, a lack of infrastructure and complicated land ownership systems. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried that cities like Nairobi \u2013 or any number across Asia \u2013 are growing so hugely with very little thought for the future in terms of infrastructure and secure land tenure,\u201d Soderbergh said. The UN has predicted that about 40 \u201cmegacities\u201d, each with a population of 10 million-plus, will exist by 2030, with Delhi, Shanghai and Tokyo among the most populated.  If there is no proper planning, the close proximity of lots of different ethnic groups in informal settlements \u201ccan lead to any number of problems, including tensions and violence,\u201d said Soderbergh.  Without recognised land tenure, developers are reluctant to upgrade informal settlements, opting instead to evict entire communities and buy land from private owners. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get people secure land tenure, especially as cities grow around them, then they will remain in a very precarious situation as developers start eyeing the land that they\u2019re living on,\u201d Soderbergh said. The relocation of minority groups and indigenous peoples into cities has yielded some positive outcomes, according to the report.  Soderbergh said: \u201cIn a number of cities in Oceania, building techniques, land management techniques that indigenous peoples have will be absolutely vital to tackle the effects of climate change in the very near future.\u201d", "tags": ["Global development", "Natural resources and development", "Indigenous peoples", "Human rights", "Iraq", "World news", "Colombia", "Canada", "China", "Kenya", "Population"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-02T10:35:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/02/orson-welles-a-touch-of-class", "sentences": ["Yet in a clutch of movies \u2013 The Lady from Shanghai (1947), The Third Man (1949), Touch of Evil and his Shakespeare films, especially Chimes at Midnight, he is much more than that, being there what he had once been in Citizen Kane, an exemplary version of the compromised person, the perfect embodiment of our imperfection.", "Directed by Welles as well as starring him, The Lady from Shanghai is a film noir composed of sweat and sleaze; it begins with a threatened gang-rape, takes us to a man who wants to be murdered and leaves us in a crazy, shattered realm where killing is just an expression of desire.", "While The Lady from Shanghai ushers us into strangeness, Touch of Evil places us inside a world of oppression, where bullies thrive and intimidation is the rule."], "title": "How Orson Welles shattered the Hollywood image", "article": "In Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels, Gulliver finds himself in the kingdom of Brobdingnag, where the people are 60ft tall. Scale is everything; blown up to gigantic proportions the human face becomes rough, pitted, the seemingly immaculate skin unmasked as imperfect. In the 20th century, Brobdingnag transformed into the picture house, a place for the pygmy public to stare up at the great stars. However, far from seeming less perfect, the enlarged human face seemed more wonderful, smoothed-out by celluloid, unattainable. Yet still strangeness clung to these super-sized persons, those colossal faces. Welles understood this, and so returned us to the Swiftian vision. In his movies, the human face that cinema loves and dwells on shows its potential for ugliness; blown up to the size of the cinema screen it looks not enchanted and godlike, but all too human and flawed. Time and again, the alienated gaze of his films confronts us with the astonishment of the human face, there in his use of closeups that come in too close. Somehow the angle of vision is off-kilter, and we see only the spit and stubble, the pockmarks and pores. This disabused image of people extends into Welles\u2019s understanding of character. Unlike some Hollywood directors, he never lost sight of the blemishes in the human face and soul. He is one of the few film-makers of the American 1940s and 50s who is never kitsch. His films resist the Lilliputian proportions of a TV or a computer: they belong to the big screen.     Janet Leigh and Charlton Heston in Touch of Evil (1958). Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext    Welles\u2019s genius, too, was larger than life, a man with a talent always threatening to burst the bounds of the studio system it was supposed to flourish in. He was not only one of the most striking and inventive film-makers who have ever lived, he was also a curious example of the movie star, operating within mainstream cinema while simultaneously dismantling his audience\u2019s conceptions of what a movie star might be. Just as Welles\u2019s films began with words, with the things that his people say, so his presence rests in large part on the growling, rumbling cello tones of his voice. It is a curiously physical sound, one that summons up the body behind it. That feels apt, for in watching Welles\u2019s work across more than 40 years, from Citizen Kane (1941) to F for Fake (1973), the metamorphosis of that body turns out to be where the attention lingers. On screen Welles embraced the collapse of his own handsomeness \u2013 the face\u2019s wrinkles and carved-out lines, the grizzled hair, the ever-expanding waist. In Touch of Evil (1958), Marlene Dietrich fails to recognise Welles in the police detective, Hank Quinlan. Puzzled by the amazing degradation of that body, she lets him know, \u201cYou\u2019re a mess, honey\u201d, merely voicing what the audience was likely already thinking. Already in Citizen Kane, Welles had pictured his own ageing; he began his screen-acting career as an old young man, and he reached the summit of it, in Chimes at Midnight (1965), as a young old man, playing Falstaff, that corrupter of youth. Following the abortive release of Kane and the mutilation by the studio of his next movie, The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), Welles\u2019s career as a director was forever hampered in the US, while his life as an actor \u2013 and voice-over narrator - more or less flourished. For a while, he was both a studio problem and an authentic movie star; it delighted the gossip columnists that he was married to another star, the forces\u2019 sweetheart, Rita Hayworth. Soon he fell away from being a leading man and launched into a lifetime of cameos and special appearances, the kind of actor who could salvage a film with a few good scenes. Yet in a clutch of movies \u2013 The Lady from Shanghai (1947), The Third Man (1949), Touch of Evil and his Shakespeare films, especially Chimes at Midnight, he is much more than that, being there what he had once been in Citizen Kane, an exemplary version of the compromised person, the perfect embodiment of our imperfection. Directed by Welles as well as starring him, The Lady from Shanghai is a film noir composed of sweat and sleaze; it begins with a threatened gang-rape, takes us to a man who wants to be murdered and leaves us in a crazy, shattered realm where killing is just an expression of desire. The very inventiveness of the camera here makes the film seem sordid, trapping us inside a place of moral and visual distortion. Only a couple of years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Bomb haunts this movie, lending an everyday story of marriage and murder an apocalyptic darkness. Watching the film, it becomes hard to shrug off the knowledge that people are incomprehensible, their motives obscure, their meaning occluded. At the end, it bewilderingly slips into using Mandarin, while Welles\u2019s character, drugged, watches a Chinese opera, an art form naturally understood by the locals in the audience, but to him that is a baffling confusion. Everyone is ugly in this film, except the leads of course, and especially the sublime Hayworth, though her beauty (at Welles\u2019s insistence \u2013 he made her cut off her long red hair) appears a concoction, a made-up peroxide blonde with sculpted eyebrows. As she moves among the drooling, ogling men, her skin looks smooth and clean \u2013 as though it has been carved from sugar icing. In this realm of confusion, Welles plays Michael O\u2019Hara, a Hemingwayesque, independent man, a romantic dupe in a world where to be alive is to be in pain. Welles\u2019s Irish accent is (to my British ears) an embarrassment of Dick van Dyke proportions, yet he here conveys as he could so well an injured sensibility, the pudgy naivety of a boy half-grown up into the life of the corrupt. Though his movies tender a darkened sense of others, in this fabricated world Welles was himself both ringmaster and victim. As an actor, he was at his best playing saloon-bar Candides. Though he often played \u201cvillains\u201d, he always brought to such roles a boyish joie de vivre that grants even the blackest characters a youthful unworldliness. He could find innocence in evil, and there is no better example of this than in his wonderful performance as Harry Lime in Carol Reed\u2019s The Third Man (1949).     Orson Welles in Citizen Kane (1941). Photograph: Allstar/RKO    Lost inside that film, I can still imagine myself, just as I used to as an adolescent, as Holly Martins (played by Joseph Cotten), the feckless, foolish, well-meaning idiot that he is. And perhaps my entire romantic life has been coloured by my teenage admiration for Alida Valli as the elusive Anna. Yet I never dreamed for a moment that I could be Harry Lime, for between him and this viewer lay the unleapable chasm of charm. By some ineffable magic, Lime, like Welles, just makes everything seem such fun. Welles denied that cinema acting should be in essence understated, and indeed the keynote of all his performances is gusto. He was a man who couldn\u2019t turn himself down. Though he never looks stagey and has none of that hitting-the-back-of-the-theatre impact that can make Laurence Olivier look overblown on film, he nonetheless fills the screen, simply by letting us share something of the energy and power that was part of who he was and part of how he performed himself to others. After years away from Hollywood, Touch of Evil was Welles\u2019s comeback film; in commercial terms, it didn\u2019t work out, but as a movie it\u2019s an amazing piece of work. While The Lady from Shanghai ushers us into strangeness, Touch of Evil places us inside a world of oppression, where bullies thrive and intimidation is the rule. It\u2019s a noir that is genuinely black-hearted, the romantic colours of the genre blooming over only its two fading film stars, the worldly-wise Marlene Dietrich and Welles himself, playing the good bad cop, Hank Quinlan, a man who puts convictions and his hunches over the inconveniences of the law. It\u2019s arguably Welles\u2019s finest performance. He works wonders here; to take only one example, whenever anyone offers him some booze, as a reformed alcoholic he replies brusquely \u201cI don\u2019t drink\u201d, until one time, when all is collapsing, he says it and then catches sight of the whisky glass he has just drained. Then comes the miracle of his performance: somehow Welles registers the jolt of the fact with an entirely blank face, signalling his own fall by apparently making no sign at all. All Welles\u2019s films feel delirious, replete with a weirdness that breaks up the standard Hollywood fare and shatters it into fragments, into a pattern of visionary shocks. In Touch of Evil, this hallucinatory intensity is especially strong; its beatnik thugs are out of a David Lynch nightmare, and the screen seems as drugged as its victimised heroine, played by Janet Leigh, who, as in Psycho, displays bad luck in choosing motels. Yet the drugs turn out to be not hallucinogens or narcotics, but sodium pentathol, the \u201ctruth drug\u201d \u2013 much as Welles\u2019s dark imaginings perhaps offer the unvarnished truth about things. There is a touch of lament, an end-of-season feel about Touch of Evil, the last great film noir of Hollywood\u2019s golden age. The movie contrasts the pianola (\u201cit\u2019s so old, it\u2019s new\u201d) with rock\u2018n\u2019roll, and the faded glamour of the old stars, Dietrich and Welles, with the virile emptiness of the new guys, such as Charlton Heston. Old Hollywood was busy beginning to die, though maybe only Welles knew it then. From now on, his career lay back in Europe, and, in the 1960s and 70s, he became a great European art-house film director, still creating masterpieces.          Chief among them is his version of Shakespeare\u2019s Henry IV plays, Falstaff: Chimes at Midnight. The film has so much that\u2019s good \u2013 John Gielgud as Bolingbroke; one of the greatest, most brutal battle scenes of cinema \u2013 but in one respect it seems seriously deficient: it lacks laughter, and laughter is Falstaff\u2019s essence. I believe that despite his humour and his humanity, Welles\u2019s view of the world was too dark to bring out this element in the old fat knight. Yet he truly embodies other equally vital aspects of the character. In conversation with Peter Bogdanovich, Welles declared that everyone acts all the time, and that in each and every conversation we\u2019re busy performing ourselves. Though this has its general application, and its Shakespearean resonances, it nonetheless feels less of a universal statement, more of a self-diagnosis. For Welles and Falstaff have much in common: both of them live as actors on the stage of everyday life, as self-dramatisers, as players. Watching the entertaining TV programme he made, Around the World With Orson Welles, you see just what a glorious flirt he was, how much he enjoyed acting the role of raconteur. Yet when he talks to a group of Chelsea Pensioners, he looks out of place, where the quiet dignity of the old men, the settled proprieties of their beliefs exposes their interviewer as a man betrayed by his own eloquence. Yet what eloquence it was! Welles is one of the few civilised voices in cinema, a Europeanised American, a preserver of urbane values. There\u2019s a touch of Henry James about him, and of those wide-eyed cynics and sophisticated dreamers Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Talking to the Chelsea Pensioners, one mentions that they are officially \u201cliving in independent retirement\u201d. \u201cGreat word, \u2018independent\u2019,\u201d says one of the old soldiers. \u201cYes, it is,\u201d says Welles. Everything about the worlds he summoned up in film and in his acting, the uniqueness and humanity of that sustained vision, shows that he meant it. \u2022 Touch of Evil is on general release 10 July.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Orson Welles"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-02T11:01:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/pets-on-holiday-share-your-photos", "sentences": ["Sent via GuardianWitness    By  gpjcyprus   7 July 2013, 23:06                Shanghai airport       Sent via GuardianWitness    By  Nelly2010   11 August 2013, 11:15                Stan channelling Magnum PI on the beach in Wales       Sent via GuardianWitness    By  ID6918350   10 July 2013, 16:14        GuardianWitness is the home of readers\u2019 content on the Guardian."], "title": "Pets on holiday: share your photos", "article": "Do you and your pet like to travel?

Then we heard about the others ... it was utterly unreal, truly, truly terrible. \u201cEven today when I talk about that day, I feel the tears come.\u201d Her eyes, which have indeed welled up, keep contact with mine, and again she looks stricken. \u201cIt seemed so, so unfair \u2013 they were pacifists, they were the journalists and cartoonists we grew up with as children. They were like the big adolescents of your family \u2013 provocative, but in the French spirit, in the Parisian spirit of debates and confrontation through ideas. Suddenly it was like part of our heritage, our values, our light had been directly attacked.\u201d Later that evening, Hidalgo joined a spontaneous gathering of tens of thousands of people in the symbolic Place de la R\u00e9publique, where candles were lit in honour of the dead.     People gather at the Place de la R\u00e9publique in Paris on the evening after the attack at the offices of Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead. Photograph: Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images    It was, she tells me, \u201ca very long and heavy day\u201d, but Paris\u2019s ordeal was far from over. The following day, a policewoman was gunned down by another self-declared jihadist who went on to murder four more people in a Jewish supermarket, Hyper Cacher, 24 hours later, before being killed in a police shootout. \u201cI went to Hyper Cacher, too; it was like a scene from a war. Again, it was terrible. Just terrible ...\u201d the sentence trails off as she shakes her head. Hidalgo had been running Paris for just nine months, and nothing \u2013 not even 13 years as deputy mayor \u2013 could have prepared her for such a tragedy. As with Ken Livingstone after the 7/7 attacks in London and Rudy Giuliani after 9/11, Hidalgo found herself stepping up as a figurehead for the bruised city. Echoing the sentiment of the shocked but defiant crowd in Place de la R\u00e9publique, she rallied Parisians: \u201cWe are standing, the republic is standing and we will not give up ... those who were killed were magnificent people who used one weapon, a pencil. We will not abandon the liberty and force they gave us,\u201d she told them. Six months later, sitting in her light and airy office overlooking the Seine (at 155 sq m it\u2019s the biggest public office in France and considerably bigger than most people\u2019s living space) and covering the gamut of issues from pedestrianisation of the river bank highways to her view of Boris Johnson, you might sometimes forget that she has led her city through such a crisis. But in truth, its ripples are still being felt today.     The Eiffel tower\u2019s lights are switched off the day after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Photograph: Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty Images    That those three days were seismic quickly became obvious. Suddenly, everyone was Charlie, or Ahmed (a Muslim police officer who was shot in the head by one of the gunmen as he lay injured on the ground outside the magazine\u2019s office). \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d became the slogan for the suffering city. World leaders, with the conspicuous exception of Barack Obama, converged on Paris to show their support for freedom and liberty of the press. \u201cThe collective spirit this city that I adore showed after the attacks took my breath away. It said: Paris is conscious of that threat, but its people insist on being able to live together and promote our community model,\u201d Hidalgo says. Hidalgo\u2019s own life story may be at the root of that conviction. The Spanish-born eldest daughter of an immigrant factory worker and a seamstress, she spent her childhood on a run-down housing estate on the outskirts of Lyon. Her parents arrived from C\u00e1diz in southern Spain when she was two, and lived with An\u00e0 \u2013 as she was then \u2013 and her sister Maria in a high-rise block with no bathrooms or lifts. At 14, she took French nationality and changed her name. School was her escape, and Paris her dream. \u201cI wanted to go to Paris to meet Sartre,\u201d she told Lib\u00e9ration. Shortly after becoming Paris\u2019s first female mayor 14 months ago, she told me it was her \u201cdream job\u201d \u2013 even if her family (she has two grownup children from a first marriage and a teenage son with her second husband, the French politician Jean-Marc Germain) have had to learn not to expect her home for dinner. If her idealism remains, it is now qualified: her \u201csocial democrat\u201d worldview \u2013 old Labour, in British terms \u2013 is tempered by realism about the need to woo business leaders. Her staff seem happy, too, describing her as charming on a personal level and choosing consultation and consensus over conflict in her politics. A year ago, the most damning criticism was that she lacked the charisma of her much-loved predecessor, Bertrand Delano\u00eb. A year on, even those who wrote her off as Delano\u00eb\u2019s dauphine admit a grudging respect. Hidalgo looks genuinely pleased when I tell her the City Hall underlings I have canvassed seem to adore her. The feeling is mutual; her office is huge, but Hidalgo\u2019s ego does not match it. She is warm, first with the \u201cbises\u201d (pecks on the cheek), natural and solicitous (\u201cDo sit here ... Would you like coffee? ... Oh look, we\u2019re both wearing flowery dresses, how summery ...\u201d). She insists on feminising her title to madame la maire in defiance of the French grammar police (le maire is the correct term), but does being a female mayor make a difference? In a previous interview she admitted being a \u201cFrench feminist\u201d who believed in justice and equality \u201cbased on performance\u201d, as opposed to what she controversially labelled an \u201cAnglo-Saxon idea that women should have power because they are better than men\u201d. Today her response is gentler but more confident.     Anne Hidalgo visiting the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Photograph: Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images    She recounts how she recently opened a new kindergarten, and was delighted to discover one of the children thought she was the mere (pronounced similarly to maire) of Paris. \u201cI found the idea rather beautiful. This idea that I was the mother of Paris,\u201d she says, laughing. If this sounds all too twee, critics and opponents quickly learn not to underestimate her. An \u201ciron fist in a velvet glove ... she likes to get her way,\u201d is how one colleague described her. Her stance on reducing pollution by introducing alternate bans on half the city\u2019s vehicles saw her and the ecology minister, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, squaring up. Motorists are furious, but most Parisians love her idea of turning the traffic-choked banks of the Seine into a pedestrian zone and reclaiming emblematic squares such as Place de la Bastille and Place de la Nation from vehicles.\u201cWe have to do this quickly and with giant steps,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI know the people of Paris feel the same way.\u201d Hidalgo\u2019s call for Paris to have a sort of drop-in \u201cwelcome centre\u201d for migrants, just days after the interior minister dispatched riot police to dismantle an illegal camp in the north of the city, has also veered from the government line. As a migrant herself, Hidalgo says she understands their plight. And she declares herself determined to try to redress some of the more blatant inequalities of east-west, north-south Paris, and believes creating affordable housing is the key. \u201cI push the message that it\u2019s important we share Paris,\u201d she says. \u201cParis is a collection of different areas \u2013 wealthy and working-class \u2013 and each is important. If you take just one of those areas away, you take away part of the strength of the city.\u201d After Jacques Chirac made the job a springboard to the Elys\u00e9e Palace in 1995, some have suggested Hidalgo might have her sights set on the top job, something she has always strenuously denied. When the photographer jokingly requests she tries a pose that is \u201ca little less presidential\u201d, she laughs. \u201cNon, non, non, please don\u2019t say that!\u201d That city mayors might have presidential or prime-ministerial ambitions is a forgivable assumption, as a glance across the Channel shows. Then again, Boris Johnson and Anne Hidalgo could hardly be more different, as their meeting earlier this year demonstrated. The press conference that followed was excruciatingly tense, as Hidalgo remained cool and Boris behaved ... like Boris: ruffling his hair, making jokes, playing the buffoon. After the unlikely rencontre, Hidalgo\u2019s people insisted \u2013 a little too vigorously, I thought \u2013 that the two had got along just swimmingly, or as Boris might have put it in his deliberately cod French: comme une maison en feu. Could this possibly be true? \u201cOui, oui, we really did get on well and I do like him. He is, what is the word, exuberant and, dare I say it, our idea of the archetypal Englishman: original, brilliant, funny,\u201d says Hidalgo. \u201cOur relationship is confident, direct and joyful. He likes a joke and I can give as good as I get.\u201d So will she be going to London any time soon? A visit earlier this year was postponed and no new date has been given. \u201cBoris invited me to come to London to ride a tandem, so I shall be coming. The only question is who will be in front. I think we will have to draw straws on that.\u201d Hidalgo likes to say that \u201cseen from Shanghai\u201d, London and Paris are twin dots, but she is keenly aware of the fierce competition between the two cities, never more evident than when London won a surprise victory over Paris in the battle to host the 2012 Olympics. In London, a day of jubilation was immediately followed by the horror of the 7/7 attacks. So it is perhaps fitting that just as the Olympics became a symbol of hope and revival for London, Hidalgo has rethought her previous opposition to Paris trying again, and approved a bid for 2024. It\u2019s a brave move when her predecessor\u2019s failure to secure the 2012 Games was such a devastating blow to him and the city, but it is a logical extension of Hidalgo\u2019s optimism and determination that Paris not be cowed. \u201cParis dreams of something else, and that is fraternity, which is what the march expressed,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterwards I felt the need of those young people involved to be carried along by a project, like the Olympics, in which they had their part to play. So I thought, let\u2019s give it a go.\u201d \u201cCharlie Hebdo changed Paris,\u201d she goes on. \u201cIt made people aware of the strength of that collective state of mind. Everyone went on with their lives saying: \u2018You will not kill our spirit. You will not silence us.\u2019 We Parisians, we French, marched supported by the whole world.\u201d", "tags": ["Paris", "France", "World news", "Charlie Hebdo attack", "Charlie Hebdo"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-03T13:53:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/chinas-stock-market-slump-continues", "sentences": ["China\u2019s efforts this week to stem the tide of losses on its main stock market failed on Friday when the Shanghai Composite index plunged a further 5.8%, taking the drop in share values to 28% since their June peak."], "title": "Panic wipes \u00a32tn off Chinese shares", "article": "China\u2019s efforts this week to stem the tide of losses on its main stock market failed on Friday when the Shanghai Composite index plunged a further 5.8%, taking the drop in share values to 28% since their June peak.  Panic selling wiped more than \u00a32tn off the value of Chinese-listed companies and traders signalled the rout would extend into next week. The authorities had cut fees and eased borrowing rules that make it cheaper to buy shares in the hope it would cheer investors battered by the relentless selling since 12 June.  A promise by the main stock market regulator to tackle concerns of market manipulation, which has sapped investor confidence in recent days, also failed to halt the slide. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the market watchdog, said it would launch an investigation into suspected stock market manipulation, without giving details of how long the probe would take or which organisations were under suspicion. In a further effort to shore up prices, the regulator cut the number of new companies coming on to the stock market by two-thirds. Ten initial public offerings will be allowed in July, the commission said on its blog account. It gave no details of which companies would be allowed to list but said the amount of money raised also would be reduced from June\u2019s level. Hexun.com, a financial news website, said 28 companies had planned to go public in the next two weeks. The latest moves followed a surprise interest rate cut on 27 June that was interpreted as a clear signal that Beijing wanted to shore up investor confidence. The explosive price rises that saw the stock market double in value began after the official media said last summer that stocks were cheap. Companies rushed to raise money with share offerings to take advantage of investor enthusiasm. Some analysts said the fall since last month was a belated symptom of China\u2019s economic woes after a slowdown in activity dating back to early last year. Manufacturing output and exports have slowed, while the finance ministry has clamped down on lending by state enterprises and local authorities for property speculation.  Officially, GDP growth is expected to remain at 7% this year, in line with the government\u2019s target, but many analysts say that official figures overestimate actual growth and it is in fact nearer 3%. Stuart Kirk, a strategy analyst at Deutsche Bank, queried why regulators eased lending rules this week. He said: \u201cAfter all, shares are still up 90% since the lows in 2013 and valuations remain frothy. The reality, however, is most investors are in the red \u2013 in fact, it is likely no money has been made during this equity boom whatsoever. The reason is because peak inflows occurred just before the recent selloff; money lost by latecomers is greater than gains made by earlier investors.\u201d  More than 20m trading accounts were opened between mid-April and mid-June to invest in the rising market and it is these accounts that have seen the biggest losses, he said. A prolonged slump could disrupt Communist party plans to use stock markets to make China\u2019s state-dominated economy more productive. The party wants state companies to raise money through share sales to reduce debt and hopes they will compete harder if they have to answer to shareholders. Party leaders also hope stock investing can provide an ageing population with more options to save for retirement and ease demand for social spending.

What would it do in a real crisis?", "article": "As Greece holds a referendum that may create more uncertainties than it solves, are we looking in the wrong place for a financial crisis? In China, the authorities are in a fine sweat about a more traditional financial conundrum: a bubble in the stock market. How do you deflate it safely? Should you even try? As with many things in China, the numbers are staggering. The two main indices \u2013 the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Composite \u2013 had risen about 150% in the 12 months to mid-June. In terms of market value, that was a gain of about $6.5tn. Since then, the market has tumbled almost 30% \u2013 call it a $2tn plunge. What\u2019s the big deal? Shares never go up in a straight line and anybody who bought a year ago has still more than doubled their money. But there are several potential problems, at least to Beijing\u2019s apparent way of thinking. First, there are a lot of latecomers to the share frenzy. In May, just before prices started to fall, 12 million trading accounts were opened. Second, some latecomers are novices ill-equipped to take losses. Trading on margin \u2013 using borrowed money \u2013 is commonplace in China, raising the likelihood that losing investors will be forced to get out in a hurry, creating more selling pressure.    Beijing was sending a message that it is setting interest rates for the stock market rather than the economy    Third, a crash in the share market could hit the real economy. Consumer confidence could be damaged. More directly, companies could find it hard to raise capital and the gradual liberalisation of the Chinese economy could stall as locals and foreigners conclude it is safer to stay away. Such worries explain why the authorities seem so keen to put a floor under share prices. Interest rates have been cut and margin requirements have been relaxed, seemingly to help investors with their backs to the wall. Banks have been told they can hold less capital with the central bank, freeing up liquidity in the financial system. So far, nothing has worked. On Friday, operations took a new direction. The securities regulator said it would look for \u201cclues of illegal manipulation across markets\u201d. In other words, short-sellers and devious individuals are being blamed \u2013 a traditional excuse for authorities who like there to be a culprit. Maybe more measures will follow if the market continues to fall. Already, voices can be heard calling for direct intervention \u2013 in other words, the state buying shares. The Chinese do things differently, but these measures seem a ridiculous over-reaction. If the authorities feel compelled to intervene every time the stock market rises 150% then corrects by 30%, they are creating massive problems for the future. Investors will believe it really is true that the share prices are \u201cofficially sanctioned\u201d. Instead of assessing companies\u2019 prospects intelligently, investors will try to guess the intentions of the bigwigs in Beijing. You can\u2019t liberalise an economy that way; you just create the risk of an even bigger bubble next time. Even if one accepted the dubious proposition that emergency measures could be justified to prevent damage to the wider economy, the authorities acted far too soon. The interest rate cut came after a 20% fall from the mid-June highs. That was a mere slip in the context of the market\u2019s rise. No wonder investors were not reassured. Beijing was sending a message that it is setting interest rates for the stock market rather than the economy. What happened to famous Chinese long-termism? The only certain way to deal with a stock market bubble is let prices fall to the point where they are cheap. At 20 times earnings, the Chinese market is not an obvious bargain even after these declines. The deeper worry is this: if the Chinese authorities think a wobble in the stock market is a threat to financial stability, do they have the ammunition to cope with a proper crisis in the more important property market? Click, collect and cough up \u2013 the new retail trend is no longer free The John Lewis click and collect service has been a huge success. Anyone who really needs another lip gloss or a new pair of tights can order by 8pm and the item is ready to collect at a John Lewis or Waitrose supermarket branch after 2pm the next day. Whether the item cost \u00a33 or \u00a3300, there is no delivery cost to customers. About half of the department store\u2019s online orders make use of the service, and the number of items being clicked and collected has exploded from 350,000 in 2008 to some 6 million now. But from the end of the month John Lewis will no longer allow free pick-ups on purchases of less than \u00a330. Customers will have to hand over \u00a32 to pick up lower-value purchases in store. It was inevitable. Shipping individual items out of a centralised warehouse in Milton Keynes, overnight, to one of hundreds of possible destinations makes no financial sense if the goods are worth just a few pounds. The profit margin on the item would be slashed. Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, had just the word to describe this sales model: \u201cbonkers\u201d. The collapse of City Link \u2013 which delivered goods for John Lewis \u2013 at Christmas shed light on the cost pressures of home deliveries. Drivers described how they received \u00a32.15 per delivery, no matter how many items were going to one house. Free click and collect is still on offer at Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and House of Fraser. But rivals will be watching the impact of the new John Lewis delivery charge, and simultaneously keeping an eye on Amazon. The online retailer last week unveiled a new Prime Now service that offers deliveries in some areas of London within an hour for \u00a36.99, or free within a two-hour slot. The likelihood is that people will pay up \u2013 \u00a32 is not a big ask for JL\u2019s well-heeled shoppers. But the charge \u2013 and the new Amazon deal, which will be rolled out beyond London in coming months \u2013 show that delivery options are now a key part of the offer. A bad reason to shorten a lifeline for savers Greeks queuing to take their cash out of banks evoke memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007. So it is apt that it should be last week that the Bank of England had to announce a \u00a310,000 cut to the amount covered by the deposit protection scheme, which became such a focus during the banking crisis. Since the end of 2010, \u00a385,000 in savings accounts in the UK has been covered by the scheme, which guarantees a saver\u2019s money should a bank, building society or credit union go bust. The level was based on the threshold of \u20ac100,000 set across the European Union at the height of banking crisis; uniformity was needed to stop savers pushing their cash across borders to chase the best protection. But as Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, points out, it is absurd that the level of protection for UK savers should depend on currency fluctuations, forcing a cut in the guarantee to \u00a375,000.

In other afternoon trading, Australia\u2019s ASX 200\u2019s fall had been narrowed to 1.2 percent to 5,473.30, while New Zealand\u2019s benchmark slipped 1 percent to 5,785.20. Shares were also lower in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.  As expected, rising fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone sent investors flocking to the yen \u2013 considered a safe haven in times of global financial uncertainty. Early jitters also afflicted the currency markets, with the Australian dollar dipping to a six-year low of US$0.7484 in early trading, although it later recovered to 0.7509. The euro was at 134.91 yen, from 136.31 yen last Friday. The dollar also slipped to 122.58 yen from 123.05 yen.

Whether it will go on to $700m is another matter, but a not-unrealistic $400m should ensure the series\u2019 continuation. (Terminator 3 managed $433.4m; Terminator Salvation, $371.4m.) Disheartening it may be for critics of Hollywood\u2019s current fondness for strip-mining intellectual property, but this is the modern box-office switcheroo par excellence: leaning on emerging markets \u2013 where fealty to relics of the star system such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Cruise is strongest \u2013 to prop up degraded franchises.  As in the US, Genisys has dropped off compared to previous Terminators in developed economies such as the UK and France. But in smaller emerging markets, such as the Philippines, Malaysia and Venezuela, it is setting highs for both the franchise and for Schwarzenegger. And the bigger emerging markets \u2013 which probably had big enough screen counts in 1991 for Terminator 2 to make its mark \u2013 are still showing strong enough growth for the franchise: most impressively, Russia (T3: $4.1m; Salvation: $7.9m; Genisys: $12.5m), Mexico (T3: $4.6m; Salvation: $2.6m; Genisys: $6.2m), Brazil (Salvation: $2.1m; Genisys: $4m). Unlike time travel, some rules of the box office seem depressingly unbendable. Wuxia revival            A Chinese martial arts movie hasn\u2019t broken out internationally in nearly a decade, since The Curse of the Golden Flower, the last in Zhang Yimou\u2019s trilogy of kung fu epics, hit the US in December 2006. That\u2019s despite admirable domestic openings in the meantime for the likes of 2013\u2019s Journey to the West ($92.4m) and 2014\u2019s The Monkey King ($50.9m). But a firm $28m No 1 start in China for Monk Comes Down the Mountain could augur a return to those early-noughties glory days, which were kicked off by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u2019s $213.5m worldwide take in 2001. Also co-produced by Sony-Columbia, the film, which stars Wang Baoquiang, from Chinese indie mega-hit Lost in Thailand, as the titular monk forced to leave his Taoist temple, looks to be a return to the comparatively realistic, literary-derived wuxia of Crouching Tiger.  It\u2019s the rowdy supernatural variety, fuelled by Chinese mythology that perhaps limits its overseas prospects, which has dominated the Chinese box office recently. Like Yimou\u2019s trilogy, Monk Comes Down the Mountain is helmed by a Fifth Generation legend: Chen Kaige, of Farewell My Concubine renown. Wong Kar-wai\u2019s The Grandmaster, which managed a respectable $6.6m US grab, hinted at a return for arty chop-socky last year, and Hou Hsiao-Hsien\u2019s The Assassin wowed at Cannes in May. No release dates in the west have been set for Monk Comes Down the Mountain, but are presumably forthcoming with Sony guiding things. This could be a chance for the supposed cinematic powerhouse China to resume exports of its most popular genre and get back on the global scoreboard. Grin and bare it   Related: Magic Mike XXL \u2013\u00a0strippers' verdict: 'A public liability claim waiting to happen'    Oh, Mike, what happened? Raunchy trailers hyped the crowd hard for the return of Tampa\u2019s premier male entertainer, and reviews suggested a sizeable section of the critical community were in the mood, too. But when it came time for sequel Magic Mike XXL to whip everything off, it proved more Magic Mike XXS, its $12m US debut looking rather flaccid next to its 2012 predecessor\u2019s $39.1m. The audience was notably 96% female, against Magic Mike\u2019s 73%, suggesting Warner Bros\u2019 promotional efforts \u2013 bigging up the bump\u2019n\u2019grind at the expense of virtually any dramatic interest \u2013 had worked too well, destroying any consensus appeal. Plus, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s central involvement lent the first film the curious allure of one of America\u2019s most respected directors edifying trashy material; with him (as pseudonymous DoP and editor) merely oiling up new director Gregory Jacobs this time, the sequel had more of an air of smash-and-grab exploitation.  With the original\u2019s box-office takings so heavily (68%) US-centric, it\u2019ll be hard for XXL to pump it up internationally \u2013 though it took $6.2m from 15 territories in this frame. Luckily, the $14.7m budget (double the first\u2019s) means this is no catastrophe \u2013 except perhaps for headliner Channing Tatum. On the back of Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, he was looking like a bona fide star in 2012, but the twin failures of XXL and Jupiter Ascending this year cast serious doubt over his efficacy as a leading man. Or, at least, over his choice of projects. He\u2019s that quintessential 21st-century A-list head-scratcher: great as an added franchise element, or in partnership with another big-hitter; risky on his own. Beyond Hollywood            China\u2019s Hollywood moratorium is still in force until the end of July, so local pictures \u2013 including Monk Comes Down the Mountain and, as already covered in previous columns, Hollywood Adventures and SPL 2 \u2013 are having the run of it. Joining them, with a $4.2m take putting it in 14th spot globally, was I Am Somebody, Derek Yee\u2019s docudrama-ish peek at fame-hungry wannabes at Hengdian World Studios (inevitably dubbed Chinawood). Korean thriller NLL: Battle of Yeonpyeong, in ninth place globally, continued to mine north-south paranoia and held extremely well for another $8m, planting it inside the annual top 10 in Korea. Hollywood \u2013 with Kingsman and Age of Ultron over-performing there \u2013 has been doing very well in 2015, but NLL is another dart in the board for one of its most formidable local competitors. And clocking in at 12th globally with the best opening ($6.8m) for a local title in France this year was Les Profs 2, followup to the $32.5m-grossing comedy about a group of teachers who rescue the worst lyc\u00e9e in France. The same UGC production outfit which turned out 2014\u2019s ($104.6m) top film, the multicultural wedding comedy Qu\u2019Est-Ce Qu\u2019On A Fait au Bon Dieu?, sends these profs to the one place where sequel mirth is guaranteed: England. Hey, we\u2019ve done it to them plenty of times. The future            There is no major new Hollywood product being stacked next week \u2013 just further shelves of Terminator Genisys, Magic Mike XXL, Inside Out and, most significantly, Minions. The latter, going great guns in the 26 territories already in play, gets its US opening, as well as openings in France, Mexico and Russia. Which leaves room in China for Tiny Times 4, the fourth instalment in three years of the massively successful saga swooning over the work and love lives of young, moneyed Shanghai urbanites.  The presumably moneyed Guo Jingming, on whose novels the series is based, writes and directs again, and will be hoping to beat the last film\u2019s $82.3m. And India gets its own Avatar moment with the release of SS Rajamouli\u2019s Baahubali \u2013 which, depending on how you measure it, could be the country\u2019s most expensive production ever. Budgeted at $40m across two parts, this pristine-looking epic about two royal brothers\u2019 struggle over an ancient kingdom is certainly up there on India\u2019s big-spenders list \u2013 which surprisingly is mostly filled with Tamil-language works, not Bollywood Hindi works (Baahubali is filmed in both Tamil and Telugu). Rajamouli has a reputation as one of the Telugu industry\u2019s leading lights: his previous film, Eega (The Fly), told the story of a man reincarnated as a house fly who must avenge his own murder.

The Shanghai Composite Index initially bounced more than 10%, after more than 20 major stockbrokers and fund managers pledged to pump at least 120bn yuan (\u00a312.3bn) into the market and started hoovering up shares in some of the country\u2019s largest businesses. But hopes of a major turnaround in the fortunes of the Shanghai exchange were dashed after much of that initial rise was lost as small investors continued to panic over the safety of their investments. The final gain was 2.4%. More than \u00a32tn has been wiped off the value of Chinese-listed companies since 12 June, when concerns about a stock market bubble gripped investors and triggered a bout of panic selling. China\u2019s stock markets had previously been among the top performing in the world, and had hit a seven-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months, but it has fallen 30% over the past three weeks \u2013 including a plunge of 12% last week.    There will be some fluctuation, but more money put into the market \u2013 I think it will be helpful to keep it steady  Shao Yu     State media reported over the weekend that the Chinese government, along with the securities regulator and financial institutions, had launched a joint effort to prevent more losses. Most of the funds were pumped into banks and state companies, which saw their value soar. Shares in PetroChina, Asia\u2019s biggest oil producer, rose by up to 10% following the move. New share offerings were also suspended on orders of the state council. Twenty-eight Chinese companies with permission to float on the Shanghai exchange said that they would postpone further issues of shares. Meanwhile, the People\u2019s Bank of China made a commitment to provide liquidity for China Securities Finance Corp, a state-owned company that provides insurance to cover stock market dealing.   China stock market value China stock market value   Some analysts seemed confident the actions would have a positive impact on China\u2019s stock markets. Shao Yu, chief economist with Orient Securities said the actions taken were clever. \u201cI think it will stabilise the market. Of course there will be some fluctuation, but more and more money put into the market \u2013 I think it will be helpful to keep the market steady,\u201d he said. However, Shao added that he did not expect the market to reach the heights it had previously. Previous efforts to keep share prices from falling, including interest rate cuts and plans to investigate short sellers, proved unsuccessful. Oliver Barron, China policy research analyst at broker NSBO, said the selloff posed profound questions for the government. \u201cAfter the market continued to fall, despite myriad support measures, the government reached peak panic mode and must have worried that investors would not only lose confidence in the markets, but in the government itself,\u201d he said.  China\u2019s stock market is made up of mostly individual investors, rather than institutional investors. Almost 90 million people hold shares and up to 1.4 million new investors a week have been opening stock accounts. According to media estimates, the average loss of individual stock accounts has been about 420,000 yuan (\u00a343,000). Meanwhile, a man has been detained by police in Beijing for allegedly spreading a rumour that someone had committed suicide due to the stock market slump. The 29-year-old man, a project manager with a technology company, posted the information along with video clips and screenshots, according to the state news agency Xinhua. His post quickly spread and provoked a lot of online debate, particularly among those who had invested on the stock market.", "tags": ["China", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Stock markets", "Chinese economy", "Global economy", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-06T17:51:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/07/beijings-desperate-attempts-to-control-the-stock-market-will-end-badly", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, supposedly independent brokers and fund managers have decided this is the ideal moment to invest the equivalent of \u00a312bn and pledge not to sell until the main Shanghai index has risen at least 20%.", "Having risen 150% in a year, the Shanghai Composite Index has surrendered 30% of its gains.", "And, at about 20 times earnings, the Shanghai market is not a bargain given the slow-down in growth in the Chinese economy."], "title": "Beijing's desperate attempts to control the stock market will end badly", "article": "Nervous about the Chinese stock market? You should be. First, it looks expensive, even after a dip. Second, the authorities in Beijing, by adopting increasingly desperate measures to prop up share prices, are sending an unmistakable message that they fear a crash is a possibility. The latest official attempt to manipulate the stock market would be laughed out of court if it were attempted in the west. The central bank is shovelling cash towards a state-backed finance company that lends to individuals who would like to make bigger bets on the stock market than they can afford. That\u2019s right, in today\u2019s communist China, there are subsidies for stock market speculation. By way of further encouragement, the state itself is piling in. A state-backed wealth fund is buying blue-chip stocks. Meanwhile, supposedly independent brokers and fund managers have decided this is the ideal moment to invest the equivalent of \u00a312bn and pledge not to sell until the main Shanghai index has risen at least 20%. This extraordinary effort, apparently, is required to \u201cuphold market stability\u201d. So what catastrophe has befallen the Chinese stock market? Well, nothing to justify all-out panic. Having risen 150% in a year, the Shanghai Composite Index has surrendered 30% of its gains. That\u2019s how excitable developing markets often work: an enormous rise can be followed by a smaller fall. It\u2019s not unusual. And, at about 20 times earnings, the Shanghai market is not a bargain given the slow-down in growth in the Chinese economy. The authorities in Beijing, one assumes, know all that. But they are inventing and deploying emergency measures anyway. Why? One assumes they think a serious slide in share prices would cause financial distress among 90 million individuals with share accounts. That might damage the real economy or, conceivably, create social unrest. Alternatively, the authorities think a crash could kill Chinese companies\u2019 long-term access to capital.  Whatever it is, Beijing has put its credibility on the line. Share prices must rise because the state, in effect, has issued an order.  The authorities may win the immediate battle with the market, though it\u2019s by no means certain. Monday\u2019s action was mixed. Blue-chip stocks, such as banks, rose because that is where the wall of money is being directed; small companies\u2019 shares mostly fell. Whatever the outcome in the next few weeks, a policy of state-directed share prices is unsustainable in the long run. If investors believe there is an official safety net to protect them from losses, the next bubble will be bigger and even harder to deflate safely.  This is a fight Beijing should have avoided. It will end badly \u2013 if not this time, then next. Rocky Rolls What does Warren East bring to the job of chief executive of Rolls-Royce? Two days in, more of the same, meaning another profits warning from the engine maker. Yesterday\u2019s was the third since last October. Only two factors in the latest dip are easy to understand. Oil and gas producers are cutting budgets to respond to a lower oil price; Rolls-Royce\u2019s marine division, which makes almost two-thirds of its revenues from the offshore industry, was bound to be hit. Similarly, everyone knows demand for business jets is soft because oil sheikhs are feeling less wealthy and western sanctions are making life trickier for Russian oligarchs. The third factor, though, is the biggest and most mysterious \u2013 the speed of the fall-off in demand for Rolls\u2019 Trent 700 engine. Decline was inevitable as the engine is nearing the end of its lucrative life, to be supplanted by the Trent 7000. But Rolls-Royce needed one last hurrah from the 700 to make the progression smooth. It fully expected to get it, only to be disappointed on both volumes and prices. This looks like an old-fashioned case of over-optimism. We\u2019re not talking marginal differences. The City cut its forecasts for Rolls\u2019 2016 profits by about 30%. To compound the forecasting error, Rolls had been planning to spend \u00a31bn buying back its own shares. East has halted the process at the halfway point, an embarrassing but correct decision. How can Rolls\u2019 board form a view on whether the stock is cheap enough to buy if it can\u2019t rely on internal projections for demand in the biggest division, civil aerospace? Shareholders will hope that East\u2019s appointment, and the arrival of finance boss David Smith last November, marks the moment when the company\u2019s revenue and profit forecasts can be relied upon. It might, but there is always the threat that East\u2019s promised review of operations brings yet another adjustment to reality. On a 10-year view, Rolls remains a terrific business; the two-year outlook, however, is fuzzy.", "tags": ["Chinese economy", "China", "Stock markets", "Global economy", "Rolls-Royce", "Asia Pacific", "Economics", "Business", "Airline industry", "Manufacturing sector"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-07T01:42:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/china-russia-superpower-axis", "sentences": ["Leaders of the Brics countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) will meet Putin in Ufa on Wednesday, then make way for the Asian powers grouped in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation."], "title": "China and Russia: the world's new superpower axis?", "article": "Forget euro summits and G7 gatherings: for the countries that like to style themselves as the world\u2019s rising powers, the real summitry takes place this week in central Russia, where Vladimir Putin will hold court. Leaders of the Brics countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) will meet Putin in Ufa on Wednesday, then make way for the Asian powers grouped in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Russia and China are the common denominators, as in so much geopolitics these days. The UN security council, Apec, the G20 - Russia and China are the ever-presents, a powerful pairing whose interests coincide more often than not. Moscow and Beijing have lots in common apart from a 2,500-mile border, economies dominated by state-run firms and oligarchies that can enrich themselves as long as they play by the prevailing political mood of the day.   organisation membership   Officially, Putin is dismissive about suggestions of a new eastern alliance. \u201cWe are not creating a military alliance with China,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWe are not creating a bloc-based approach, we are trying to create a global approach.\u201d And yet both countries share a desire to limit American power; they enjoy a burgeoning trade relationship in which, in essence, hydrocarbons are swapped for cheap consumer goods; and they have a mutual interest in promoting an alternative model to western diplomacy. Trade has increased sixfold over the past decade. Last year they trumpeted the biggest gas deal in history. The summer will be bookended by two striking events: Russian and Chinese warships puttering about together in the eastern Mediterranean in May, gaming war; and Russian and Chinese presidents standing shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in September.  So how robust is the Russia-China axis?  Geopolitics For China, one of the main attractions of closer relations with Russia is the potential for challenging Washington\u2019s still dominant global position. \u201cIn China, where until recently the official line was \u2018non-alignment\u2019, some prominent scholars have started to make unambiguous calls for a comprehensive strategic alliance with Russia,\u201d Alexander Korolev, at the National University of Singapore\u2019s centre on Asia and globalisation, argued recently. \u201c[They are] arguing on the pages of the CCP [Communist party] central party school\u2019s internal publications that \u2018China-Russia strategic relations are the most substantive ones\u2019 and elsewhere that \u2018China will be unable to shift the world from unipolarity to bipolarity unless it forms a formal alliance with Russia.\u2019\u201d But often cooperation and tension are two sides of the same coin. Take Central Asia. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has set his sights on a \u201cnew silk road\u201d, using China\u2019s billions to help neighbours and regional allies to develop, indirectly supporting growth at home and the expansion of Chinese soft power. However, this is also Russia\u2019s traditional sphere of influence and any Chinese presence that goes beyond commercial dealings is likely to raise hackles in Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s totally possible for China to develop its relations with central Asian countries without challenging Russia,\u201d said Liu Jun, a Russian studies expert at East China Normal University. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Russia would be concerned if China\u2019s influence in Central Asia grew too much, but the concerns are not mainstream in the bilateral relations \u2013 there are more benefits in cooperation than otherwise.\u201d Russia shares the strategic goal of challenging US hegemony in favour of a more multipolar world, and the two powers often find themselves on the same side in the UN security council, where they wield vetoes as permanent members.     Vladimir Putin puts a shawl on Peng Liyuan, the wife of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a firework display last year. Photograph: AP    No deal on regulating Iran\u2019s nuclear programme can be made without Russia and China, which have staunchly backed its atomic expansion in the past, and the two countries\u2019 support is largely the reason Bashar al-Assad has been able to hold on to power in Syria. Recently, Russia has been making political and economic overtures to North Korea, which relies on food, arms and energy from its key ally, China, to survive. As they support the idea of a multipolar world against American dominance, Moscow and Beijing will also tacitly back each others\u2019 attempts to defend their own spheres of influence, said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. In the past two years, Russia has annexed Crimea and backed a separatist campaign to frustrate Ukraine\u2019s turn to the west, and China has been disputing islands with western allies in the South China Sea. \u201cChina admits de facto that Russia has interests in eastern Europe, Russia admits that China has interests around the perimeter of its borders, and even though neither will actively help its partner in Ukraine or the South China Sea, both will observe an advantageous neutrality,\u201d Trenin said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be criticism of each other in the areas of their core interests.\u201d Leadership Government enthusiasm for warmer ties with Russia is summed up by a recent video from the state-controlled Xinhua news agency entitled What Do Chinese People Think About Russia?\u201d It features Chinese children describing Russia as \u201ceven bigger than China\u201d, an old man praising Russia\u2019s strength, demands for more investment, gas sales, a high-speed train, and plenty of airtime given to adulation of the Russian president. Putin has long been popular in China, where he is seen as a strong leader who has bolstered national pride, and is not a little admired for his topless photo shoots. \u201cPutin you\u2019re a handsome man,\u201d says one middle-aged woman on being asked what message she would like to send to Moscow. There is also an overt comparison to Xi, who has fostered a personality cult of bold leadership that has echoes of the Russian leader\u2019s (though with less bare flesh). \u201cPutin is the same as our \u2018Papa Xi\u2019,\u201d says one young man, using a government endorsed affectionate term for the president. For their part, Russians are more ambivalent about Xi, who has a far lower profile in Russia than does his counterpart in China. Trade China\u2019s interest in Russian exports has until now been largely focused on natural resources and military hardware. Beyond that they do not make natural partners. Russia can offer little by way of famous brands or innovation in consumer technology to tempt ordinary Chinese customers. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that there is political will behind the business cooperation. Without it, a lot of things won\u2019t happen,\u201d Liu said. \u201cMost big projects are backed by the governments and the volume of trade along the border is quite small.\u201d       The imbalance of the relationship can be seen in the breakdown of their bilateral trade, worth around $100bn a year. China is Russia\u2019s second largest trading partner after the EU, while Russia only just scraped into a list of China\u2019s top 10 trading partners, accounting for barely 3% of the country\u2019s total trade volume.  Moscow is also hoping Beijing will help with finance for businesses, after western funds dried up last year. Some Chinese firms have seen the Russian economic wobble as an opportunity to make capital investments in the country.       Energy China and Russia should make natural partners in energy deals, but in reality they have struggled to turn past agreements into real supply deals; pipelines announced last decade have still not been built because of disagreements over pricing and other conditions. Earlier this year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China for the first time, with Russian exports to China more than doubling since 2010. But Beijing is accustomed to shopping around for energy and driving a very cheap bargain with its suppliers, while Russia is used to controlling prices for European customers with few other options.  The expansion of shale gas production may have weakened Russia\u2019s hand by improving global supply, but China is also increasingly concerned about climate change and needs to wean itself off the dirty coal that still provides well over half its energy. Since Russia has rarely agreed to sell stakes in strategic land-based deposits to western companies, Putin\u2019s offer of a stake in state oil champion Rosneft\u2019s biggest production asset, the Vankor oilfields, to China in September underlined the new direction the country\u2019s energy policy is taking.      Workers inspect the pipelines and oil storage tanks of a crude oil pipeline between Russia and China in Heilongjiang province, north-east China. Photograph: Wang Jianwei/AP    The offer was made at a ceremony to start construction of Russia\u2019s $55bn Power of Siberia pipeline, a breakthrough project that is planned to deliver an annual 38bn cubic metres of gas to eastern China over the next 30 years. In November, the two countries also signed a framework agreement for an Altai gas pipeline to potentially supply 30bn cubic metres of gas to western China each year for 30 years. But neither pipeline deal appears to have been completely finalised, and economic sanctions and a weak rouble will probably make financing the huge projects difficult for Russia\u2019s Gazprom.  \u201cIt seems like at every meeting there\u2019s some sort of document signed and hailed as another big agreement \u2026 but Gazprom will need to develop large fields and construct the pipelines,\u201d said Grigory Birg, an analyst at Investcafe. \u201cI think in the current environment securing the finances is the major holdup, and we don\u2019t have any indication as to the economics of the project.\u201d  Although Birg estimated the rate of return on the Power of Siberia investment to be a modest 9% to 10% when the deal was signed, the profitability is likely to be even less if global oil prices remain weak. Beijing will, by all appearances, be able to drive an even harder bargain for the gas price under the proposed Altai pipeline to western China, a region that has less demand than the industrialised east of the country and already receives cheap gas from nearby Turkmenistan. Nonetheless, analysts expect energy cooperation to continue to grow as Russia seeks alternatives to the politically thorny European market, and China addresses growing demand and problems with pollution and blackouts. Last year, China replaced Germany as Russia\u2019s biggest buyer of crude oil. \u201cChina is the major alternative market and is easily accessible for Russia given the [location of energy] reserves and the geopolitical partnership, so it\u2019s an obvious fit,\u201d Birg said. \u201cBut the timing at which it is happening is not in favour of Russia.\u201d    Pipeline to china   Currency Both Russia and China have an interest in loosening the US dollar\u2019s dominance in global trade as the world\u2019s reserve currency. Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments (something that other oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, don\u2019t do). Following the imposition of sanctions, Russian companies and banks \u2013 traditionally reliant on dollar-denominated syndicated loans \u2013 started to look to China for a financial escape route. The rouble-yuan currency pair reached records in trading volumes last summer.  Russian companies are not new to the renminbi market, nor to the issuing of \u201cdim sum bonds\u201d \u2013 bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and largely issued by entities based in China or Hong Kong. In the past these options represented a cheaper source of funding. Now they\u2019re a necessity. However, yields on Russian corporate bonds denominated in yuan have increased as the list of sanctions started mounting up. Military  Russian arms sales to China have been estimated at $1bn a year, the Russians were previously hesitant to give advanced weaponry to the Soviet Union\u2019s one-time military rival. But the recent announcement by Russia\u2019s state arms exporter of a deal to supply China with its S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has taken their relationship to a new level at a time when Beijing is seeking new air and naval defence technologies. The higher-level arms sales have been accompanied by greater military cooperation, which was on display in May with the war games in the Mediterranean Sea. Such exercises in what has traditionally been a \u201cNato pond\u201d are designed to expand the Chinese navy\u2019s reach while showing the United States that Russia is a potentially important military partner, according to Trenin.  Following the Ukraine crisis, which soured relations with the west, he said the main considerations behind Russia\u2019s \u201centente\u201d with China were political. \u201cNow Russia has an important stimulus to grow relations with China, because relations with the west are troubled, and China is the only large player in the world that can be considered as economic, political and to a certain extent military ally,\u201d Trenin said.    China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies    Both sides, meanwhile, are concerned that the unrest in Pakistan and Afghanistan could spill over into their territory, or serve as incubators for militants who may one day return home. But none of that means that either side has forgotten past disputes or present differences. Russia is nervous about China sapping its revenue by reverse engineering the equipment it buys, and is also monitoring Beijing closely for any attempts to project military power into central Asia.  \u201cChina and Russia\u2019s strategic partnership is a result of the times, but it is totally different from a military alliance such as the one between the US and Japan,\u201d the Global Times, a Chinese nationalist tabloid, said in a recent editorial. \u201cChina and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies. They do mean that. China also cares about relations with western countries. Russia does not want to see relations with the west become a deadlock.\u201d     UN vetoes   Cyber security Both Russia and China share a concern over the US domination of the internet. In January, Russia, China and a number of central Asian dictatorships jointly submitted a new proposal for an international code of conduct on information security to the UN general assembly. In a clause clearly aimed at the US, the document calls for countries \u201cnot to use information and communications technologies and \u2026 networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability\u201d. At a recent internet security forum in Moscow, officials from both countries called for a new approach to online security. \u201cIt\u2019s great they [the US] invented the iPhone but when you open your iPhone and see the camera you have to guess whether it\u2019s photographing you at that moment or not,\u201d said Konstantin Malofeyev, a controversial businessman known for his backing for the Russian Orthodox church and the pro-Russian separatist movement in east Ukraine. \u201cRussia went into space first and Antarctic first but we don\u2019t control those things, they are controlled by international charters. Why should the US control the internet?\u201d     The Chinese flag in front of the Google China headquarters in Beijing. Photograph: Sinopix/Rex    Chinese official Chen Xiaohua said: \u201cWe should join hands to build cyberspace order. Various countries share a consistent vision of enhancing the governance of cyberspace \u2026 following the principles of mutual trust and mutual respect.\u201d In the meantime, Beijing and Moscow signed a landmark cyber-security deal recently that could bolster defence against external attack as well as allowing them to share technology for domestic control.  The two countries have poured resources into managing the internet, aiming to curb its potential as a platform for dissent. Beijing\u2019s \u201cgreat firewall\u201d is a powerful and sophisticated filter of the online world, but is still porous enough that most people inside China do not need to bother trying to evade it. Both countries also field armies of both hackers and paid pro-government commenters, known in China as the \u201c50 cent\u201d group, because of how much they are paid for each post. However, experts say their focus on internal controls may have come at the expense of security. \u201cPrioritising political information control over technical cyber defence also damages China\u2019s own cybersecurity,\u201d Jon Lindsay of Harvard University\u2019s Belfer centre for science and international affairs said in a recent briefing. \u201cLax law enforcement and poor cyber defences leave the country vulnerable to both cyber criminals and foreign spies.\u201d  Business mood Among some business people, there is a fear that the enforced turn to the east will mean Russia selling out from a position of weakness. \u201cThe downturn in relations with the west is bad for Russia and bad for the west; the only beneficiary is China,\u201d one top Russian businessman said. \u201cThe number of Chinese delegations coming to Russia has gone up tenfold, and the Chinese will only enter the market when they see the conditions are very beneficial to them.\u201d Russian media have been told to play up links with China and other non-western countries, and companies have felt pressure from the government to look eastwards even if it makes little business sense. But what initially seemed pointless may be starting to bear some fruit. \u201cIt started as theatre, but now there are some companies out there really getting stuff done,\u201d said Tom Blackwell, CEO of EM, a consultancy firm that has worked with a number of major Russian companies on exploring the Chinese market. \u201cChinese investment funds have very little experience or knowledge about Russia and it\u2019s a hard sell. But the strategy seems to be to do the big state deals first and assume smaller ones will follow. Slowly, real things are happening.\u201d Russia\u2019s federal migration service is especially wary of an influx of Chinese migrants across the Russia-China border. It has stated that Chinese could become the largest ethnic group in Russia\u2019s far east by the 2020s or 2030s; last summer a border official said that 1.5 million Chinese illegally entered the region from January 2013 to June 2014.

The move, considered by many analysts to be another stumbling response to a full-blown share price crash, sparked a nervous reaction in commodity markets and sent copper prices to a six-year low. Beijing has supported a series of market operations to halt a sharp decline in share values on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges over the past four weeks, but each one has been criticised for failing to restore market confidence. Chinese shares fell on Tuesday after premier Li Keqiang\u2019s failure to mention the deepening market crisis in a statement on the economy. Before the market opened, Li said in comments on a government website that China had the confidence and ability to deal with challenges faced by its economy. But he had nothing to say about the three-week plunge that has knocked about 30% off Chinese shares since mid-June.   Related: Beijing's desperate attempts to control the stock market will end badly     After a brief pause to the slide on Monday, the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.8% on Tuesday, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.3%. The ChiNext growth board, home to some of China\u2019s headiest small-cap valuations, fell 5.1%. Commodities followed the downward march of shares, with the benchmark copper price on the London Metal Exchange falling nearly 6% to $5,261.50 a tonne \u2013 its lowest since July 2009. The metal, used in power and construction, recovered a little of its earlier losses later in the day, but reflected falls in nickel and other industrial metals. In an attempt over the weekend to halt the slide in domestic markets, China has arranged a curb on new share issues and enlisted brokerages and fund managers to buy massive amounts of shares, helped by China\u2019s state-backed margin finance company, which in turn has a direct line of liquidity from the central bank. The suspension of trading in some of the worst-hit firms was another tactic adopted by regulators that has so far failed to restore confidence. On Tuesday another 173 firms announced trading suspensions after the market, bringing the total to almost 950, or more than a third of all listed firms on the two main exchanges. Analysts said the government was taking a big risk. \u201cChina\u2019s leadership has doubled down on its efforts to prop up equity prices, because it believes that its own credibility is now coupled to continued gains on the markets,\u201d said Mark Williams of consultancy Capital Economics.  \u201cOur view remains that a market rally cannot run ahead of economic fundamentals indefinitely,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a good chance that the market rescue efforts are seen to be a failure in a few months\u2019 time.\u201d Global investors have grown increasingly worried that a crash could destabilise the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and the source of much of the world\u2019s economic growth. \u201cI don\u2019t see any change in the downward trend,\u201d said Qi Yifeng, analyst at consultancy CEBM. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of whether the market will fall more slowly, or continue to go south in a freefall.\u201d   The official Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday that China\u2019s major insurance firms ploughed tens of billions of yuan into blue-chip exchange-traded funds (ETF), and large listed companies on Monday.        China Life Insurance bought a net 10bn yuan (\u00a31bn) in index funds, while China Pacific Insurance Group and other insurers each invested more than 1bn yuan, the newspaper said.  The purchases helped the indexes rise just over 2% on Monday, but the relief was shortlived.  Lei Mao, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said government measures to support the market distorted the allocation of funds, and trading behaviour, and could create the conditions for further sharp falls.  \u201cEven an optimistic investor should not participate in the market for now,\u201d he said.  Traders are increasingly unnerved by the unusually large number of Chinese companies asking for their shares to be suspended from trading, fearing that many of them are looking for excuses to sit out the market turmoil.  About a quarter of the 2,800 companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen had filed for a trading halt by the close on Monday. On Tuesday, the Securities Times said another 200 had announced a suspension.  Investors were also reacting to news of tightened restrictions on futures trading on a major index of smaller companies. The rapid decline of China\u2019s previously booming stock market, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, has become a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China\u2019s senior leaders, who are already struggling to avert a sharper economic slowdown.  Even China\u2019s bullish securities regulators admitted that markets had become frothy before they turned down, but the slide quickly showed signs of getting out of hand.  A surprise interest rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other \u201cstability measures\u201d did little to calm investors, many of whom are individual investors who have borrowed heavily to play the stock market.   In a series of announcements on Saturday, China\u2019s top brokerages pledged to collectively buy at least 120bn yuan of shares to help steady the market, and said they would not sell while the Shanghai Composite Index remained below 4,500. The index has traded below that level since 25 June.

It describes what would be a severe faux pas in any European or North American workplace, and would be embarrassing almost anywhere. Translated literally, inemuri means \u201cbeing present while sleeping\u201d, and indeed that describes the practice fairly literally as well, because inemuri is going to sleep in front of people while you are meant to be doing other things \u2013 which can, and often does, include sitting in a meeting room and listening to them speak.  Inemuri is not shameful, however, as it would be in the west, where sleeping on the job \u2013 let alone in a meeting \u2013 signals a loss of self-control, and therefore weakness. Instead, it is conventionally understood to mean that the sleeper is so dedicated to their work that they are momentarily exhausted by it. If carried out correctly an inemuri is an honourable kind of minor failure, like having no time to eat lunch, or 200 unanswered emails. It\u2019s a commercial war wound to show off.      A man takes a nap on a bench in Tokyo. Photograph: Yuya Shino/Reuters    But only if carried out correctly. Because there are rules. \u201cIt depends who you are,\u201d says Dr Brigitte Steger, an Austrian sociologist based at Cambridge University with a special interest in Japanese culture. \u201cIf you are new in the company and have to show how actively you are involved, you cannot sleep. But if you are 40 or 50 years old and it is not directly your main topic, you can sleep. The higher up the social ladder you are, the more you can sleep.\u201d Another rule of inemuri governs posture \u2013 because what is honourable, is to fall asleep despite your best efforts, not on purpose. \u201cYour body needs to pretend that you are active in a meeting, like you are concentrating,\u201d Steger says. \u201cYou cannot sleep under the table or anything. You have to sit as if you are listening intently, and just put your head down.\u201d If you can find a stable arrangement, an inemuri can then last for five minutes, 30 minutes, an hour \u2026 as long as necessary. If someone speaks to you, you just have to wake up and answer. Afterwards you can happily tell friends that you did an inemuri during the meeting, or even say that it happens often. What you cannot do is check in advance which parts of a meeting you should sleep through. Japan is a very underslept nation \u2013 either the most underslept in the world or the second most, after Korea, depending on which study you read \u2013 so you might expect them to need such a drastic solution. Yet napping, and the need to nap, are universal. Abundant research \u2013 at the universities of Loughborough, Pennsylvania, California and many others \u2013 shows the immediate and pronounced benefits of even just 10 or 20 minutes sleep on a tired mind. (That\u2019s if you need research to tell you that sleep makes you feel better when you\u2019re feeling sleepy.) In short it is rather odd that almost the whole world, and especially the cities where so many people spend their days, have not yet found a way to incorporate napping into the culture.     An employee snoozes in the nap pod at Google HQ. Apple, Nike and the Huffington Post have also introduced napping infrastructure into their offices. Photograph: Alamy    And goodness knows people have tried. In 2000, the city of Vechta in northern Germany became briefly famous for allowing civil servants to nap during the day, apparently with good results, but without provoking many imitators. Right now in London for instance, if you need a nap you can use some spas, such as Margaret Dabbs at Liberty in the west end, where for some reason they\u2019ll also spray you with \u201cnegative ionized salt particles\u201d. (Price: \u00a335 for one nap, or \u00a3240 for 10.) You can book into one of the city\u2019s hundred or so \u201cday use\u201d hotels (minimum price: \u00a345), which \u201callow you to have a rest or\u201d (brace yourself) \u201ca moment sexier\u201d. During London\u2019s Clerkenwell Design Week, tired workers were able to pencil in 10 minutes of shut-eye in the \u2018sleeperie\u2019 installation. Or if the weather is good, you can lie down in the park. But that is about it.    Boasting about how much coffee you drink is the western inemuri    Last spring, sensing the unmet need for naps in cities around the world, two people in the Netherlands created Googlenaps.info, a site that allowed suitable spots to be marked on Google\u2019s mapping software. It now seems to be out of use. There are capsule hotels, famously, in Japan and other parts of East Asia (banks of cheap coffins for people to sleep in) but these are more often used overnight. Indeed, even with capsule hotels and inemuri available to them, surreptitious napping in internet and manga cafes is much more common in Tokyo, according to Steger. Desperate nappers everywhere can even turn to the \u201costrich pillow\u201d \u2013 essentially a huge boxing glove for your head \u2013 as long as they don\u2019t mind looking utterly ridiculous. Practically speaking, though, if you want to take a nap in London, New York, Toronto, or most other cities, you have to go to the toilet, or look around for a discreet chair. Probably the most determined movement towards a napping infrastructure comes in airports, train stations and offices, which in a few cases provide special nap rooms or pods. Employees at some offices of Apple, Nike, BASF, Opel, Google, the Huffington Post and Proctor &amp; Gamble (but not the Guardian) can use designated nap facilities when they feel the need. So too can students at the universities of Manchester and East Anglia, among others around the world. But we are talking here about a fraction of a fraction of enough. Toilet breaks happen throughout the day, remember, but everybody tends to need their naps in the early afternoon, so it would take a huge number of rooms or pods to accommodate even half of them. And how many have you seen in the wild? When contacted both Sleepbox, a British manufacturer of nap pods, and Metronaps, a New York rival, say that they are seeing more interest in their products, but decline to say how many are currently in use around the world. (Metronaps\u2019 website says \u201chundreds\u201d.) \u201c[Employers] just need a little help to implement this paradigm shift in the workplace from a practical and cultural perspective,\u201d says Christopher Lindholst, CEO of Metronaps.     A vendor takes a nap on his counter in Shanghai. \u2018China has a healthy napping culture\u2019. Photograph: Liu Jin/EPA    He may be right, but \u201ca little help\u201d may also be much bigger than it seems. Because culturally, we have a problem with sleep. People can do without it if they have to, unlike going to the toilet, so that is what\u2019s expected. It is also less spectacular or unhygienic, so occasional lapses are not quite so catastrophic. Sleep must be done in private when possible, that\u2019s the rule, or surreptitiously when not. Hence the idea of the \u201cpower nap\u201d, reputedly coined by the Cornell psychologist James Maas in 1998, which has caught on in theory but not in practice. Indeed its brave attempt to rebrand sleep as something dynamic \u2013 in the same way that Metropods calls its office bed the EnergyPod \u2013 reveals the image problem that sleep has. Meanwhile the challenge of staying awake has only risen with the growth of cities, where people work all day on chairs in warm offices. By making big cities possible, commuter trains have also created a culture of rising earlier and spending the day further from your bed, with the result that fewer people can slip home at lunchtime. Ironically, commuter trains now also provide the one place where naps are acceptable and convenient. Not very convenient, though, since nobody commutes in the early afternoon, and there\u2019s always the risk of missing your stop. Instead of incorporating naps into daily life, what we incorporate instead is a lot of coffee - one industry that has grown enormously in the past 20 years. Coffee costs money, however, and works less well. Nevertheless, boasting about how much coffee you drink is the western inemuri.   Related: Meet the 'digital nomads' who travel the world in search of fast Wi-Fi    Worse still, in those countries that have a nap culture, it is in decline. The siesta of Spain and much of the Hispanic world seems to be slowly disappearing, as does the French lunchbreak and the Italian riposo. It is easy to get misty-eyed about this, but there are good reasons why a long lunchbreak may not be ideal either. It is just not convenient to be out of the office when the rest of your continent is working. It also tends to extend the work day deep into the evening, with the result that many people see less of their children. Perhaps the closest that exists to a healthy napping culture can be found in China, in the colder regions as well as the hot ones, where the nap or wu shuy (taken during the lunchtime rest or xiu xi) is a national institution. Like all national institutions it also has a tangled political history, and isn\u2019t universally approved of, but generally speaking being seen asleep during the day is not considered shameful by the Chinese. Indeed the right to xiu xi was specifically included in Mao\u2019s constitution.  If public napping ever does take off, the boost to health and productivity may well be tremendous. And it has other benefits as well, for those who enjoy office intrigue. \u201cSometimes actually people pretend to sleep,\u201d Steger says, speaking again of inemuri. \u201cThat\u2019s if someone doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. Or I know of one person in a very high position who pretends to sleep so that people around him are allowed to speak without being afraid of saying something wrong \u2026 and then of course he can hear what they\u2019re talking about. But of course people do usually know that he is only pretending to be asleep, so they only pretend to be very frank.\u201d In an office like that surely no one need apologise for feeling tired.", "tags": ["Cities", "Sleep", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Health", "Science", "Work-life balance", "Work & careers", "Tokyo holidays"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-07T10:48:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/jul/07/why-new-rules-should-switch-to-a-default-price-cap-on-gas-and-electricity", "sentences": ["About a quarter of the firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have asked for trading in their shares to be halted.", "The Shanghai Composite is down 28% from its mid-June highs and the Shenzhen version is about 38% lower."], "title": "Why new rules should switch to a default price cap on gas and electricity", "article": "It is possible there a few people who haven\u2019t heard that it is possible to change one\u2019s supplier of gas and electricity, but there can\u2019t be many. The Competition and Markets Authority would like more \u2013 a lot more \u2013 to do the deed. Ofgem, the industry regulator, has been saying the same thing for a couple of decades, only to find its cries received with utter indifference in many quarters. By contrast, the CMA has an idea to improve the lot of those who are too lazy, or too baffled by complexity, to save themselves \u00a3160 a year or thereabouts. It suggests a default tariff that would act as a safeguard against unfair pricing. The price would apply only to the most expensive tariffs and would be set at a sort of Goldilocks level \u2013 low enough to prevent gouging of non-switchers, but not so low that it kills competition. One glorious day in the future, when competition is deemed to be effective, the safeguard would be removed. The CMA\u2019s vision of a competitive market rests heavily on the supposed wonders of smart meters, which is alarming. As the Institute of Directors has argued persuasively, this \u00a312bn programme smells like a vastly expensive way to install technology that may be out-of-date by the time it arrives. But a default price cap \u2013 a limited and soft form of price regulation \u2013 is a much better idea. It has several advantages. First, it avoids a breakup of the big six suppliers, which would probably cause more confusion that it solves. Second, it\u2019s more intelligent than Ed Miliband\u2019s blunt \u201cprice freeze\u201d proposal because it recognises the reality that wholesale energy prices move. Third, a default price sets a semi-official benchmark against which suppliers\u2019 other tariffs can be compared. Do non-switchers deserve a nanny regulator to hold their hand to such a degree? Some government ministers may hate a proposal with even the slightest whiff of price regulation. They should reconsider. The CMA\u2019s report is sober and unremarkable in most respects \u2013 it gives a clean bill of health to the wholesale energy market, for example, and says integration between generators and suppliers is fine. But the key finding is that households have been paying \u00a31.2bn a year too much for their energy, and small businesses are losing \u00a3500m. If those statistics are robust, a regulatory response is required. A safeguard tariff is a cleverer idea than anything that has emerged from Ofgem over the years. The energy companies, who keep telling us they want to restore \u201ctrust\u201d in their industry, should get behind it. This report could have been a lot worse for them. China crisis? There\u2019s one way to stop investors selling shares \u2013 just suspend trading in a large part of the market. Yes, it\u2019s the latest chapter in China\u2019s cack-handed attempt to prevent its over-valued stock market falling further. About a quarter of the firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges have asked for trading in their shares to be halted. Most of these companies have offered an excuse of some sort \u2013 a restructuring or share issue in the offing. But it defies belief that all these explanations are genuine. Rather, the rash of suspensions look to be part of the state-sponsored share-support operation that has already seen the government funds step in as big buyers of shares. It\u2019s not working. The Shanghai Composite is down 28% from its mid-June highs and the Shenzhen version is about 38% lower. As described here recently, Beijing looks both desperate and naive. If the authorities wanted to prevent a bubble, they should have acted by the market recorded a 150% year-on-year gain. Even after the falls of recent weeks, valuations still look too high. On Tuesday, it was suggested here that Beijing might succeed in pushing water uphill just this once, only to create bigger problems next time. Now one can\u2019t be confident even in that prediction. Bloomberg calculates that about a fifth of China\u2019s stock market value \u2013 $1.4tn of equity \u2013 is frozen. Who knows what the real prices would be?

Stock markets in China are tumbling. A three-week plunge has knocked about 30% off Chinese shares since mid-June. China\u2019s securities regulator has warned of \u201cpanic sentiment\u201d gripping investors, many of whom are individuals that have borrowed heavily to play the stock market. Hundreds of Chinese companies have suspended dealings in their shares in a bid to arrest a frenzy of selling. The authorities have stepped in with various measures, including a surprise interest rate cut. But so far, their efforts have failed to stem the rout and some analysts say the moves by officials have only served to heighten alarm. Investors and policymakers around the world are looking on with growing concern that turmoil in the stock markets will spill into China\u2019s real economy, the second-largest in the world and a huge engine of global growth.  But weren\u2019t China\u2019s stock markets soaring just a few weeks ago? They were. China\u2019s stock markets had previously been among the highest performing in the world, and had hit a seven-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months.   Shanghai stock market Shanghai stock market   What was behind the dramatic rise in shares? Investors have been piling in, encouraged by falling borrowing costs as the central bank loosened monetary policy.  Unlike most other stock markets, where investors are mostly institutional, more than 80% of investors in China are small retail investors. The rise was also fuelled by a switch away from property investment following a clampdown by the government on excessive lending by banks. Laws liberalising the stock market also made it easier for funds to invest and for firms to offer shares to the public for the first time. The past six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.   Related: Chinese stock markets continue to nosedive as regulator warns of panic    Why did the market turn? Analysts were already warning that the dramatic rise in China\u2019s stock markets was driven by momentum rather than fundamentals. Stocks were looking wildly overvalued at a time when the Chinese economy was losing steam. As fears grew that the rise in many stocks was unsustainable, the selling started. Even China\u2019s bullish securities regulators admitted markets had become frothy before they turned down. How could so many people afford to buy shares? At the centre of the dramatic stock market slide are individual investors borrowing from a broker to buy securities. There has been an explosion in so-called margin lending. Under that system, the broker can make a demand for more cash or other collateral if the price of the securities has fallen \u2013 known as a margin call. What is the problem with margin calls? In short, the problem for China\u2019s 90 million or so retail investors is that shares can go down as well as up.  Margin calls are in no way exclusive to Chinese markets. But the mix of investors is unusual compared with most global markets. As brokerages have lapped up people\u2019s appetite for borrowed money and stock market bets, more households have become exposed to the risk of a stock market correction.  Regulators have cracked down on margin trading in recent months and the resulting falling share prices have triggered margin calls. If those margin calls continue, investors will have to offload other assets to come up with the cash they need. What are companies doing? About 1,300 companies have suspended their shares \u2013 almost half the market \u2013 in what analysts see as an attempt to sit out the rout.  Some companies have suspended trading because they have used their own stock as collateral for loans and they want to \u201clock in the value for the collateral\u201d, said Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Peking University. What are the Chinese authorities doing? Beijing has supported a series of market operations to halt the sharp decline, but each one has been criticised for failing to restore market confidence. China has arranged a curb on new share issues and enlisted brokerages and fund managers to buy massive amounts of shares, helped by China\u2019s state-backed margin finance company, the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), which in turn has a direct line of liquidity from the central bank. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, said it would continue to work with the CSFC to steady the stock market.  The CSFC also said it would purchase more shares of small and medium-size listed companies \u2013 the firms that have suffered the biggest losses in the rout.   Related: China stocks tumble again after premier Li Keqiang fails to mention crisis    How worried is the government? The rapid decline of a previously booming stock market has become a major headache for the president, Xi Jinping, and China\u2019s senior leaders, who are already struggling to avert a sharper economic slowdown. Analysts say the government sees the strength of the Chinese stock market as a sign of its own clout, hence all the attempts to steady the market. Mark Williams, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cChina\u2019s leadership has doubled down on its efforts to prop up equity prices, because it believes that its own credibility is now coupled to continued gains on the markets.\u201d .\u201d Because so many of the investors in the market are individuals, the government will be acutely aware that deepening losses risk denting the real economy and even fuelling social unrest. Then again, in a statement on the economy this week, the premier, Li Keqiang, failed to mention the deepening market crisis. What is the economic backdrop? China\u2019s economy was already losing steam. Its GDP growth rate halved from 14% in 2007 to 7.4% last year. The next GDP figures in mid-July are expected to show the slowest growth since before the financial crisis. In a sign of softening demand, imports have been falling in recent months. Exports have also eased off, despite government measures to stimulate growth. But analysts are divided over the scale of the risk to the real economy from the stock market turmoil. They question the strength of links between the two.  Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cIt goes without saying that movements in the Chinese stock market don\u2019t necessarily correlate to China\u2019s economy. This applied on the way up when Chinese stocks rallied more than 100% in the space of a year while economic growth was the slowest in six years. This should also be the case on the way down; just because stocks are crashing, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have a knock-on effect on China\u2019s economy.\u201d Will this spill into other markets? That is the worry. To cover margin calls, investors are having to sell other assets to raise money. Commodities such as copper and silver have fallen in recent days. On top of that, there is the effect on investor sentiment from the Chinese sell-off and fears its real economy could suffer.   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng   The contagion is already being felt in other Asian shares, which slid to a 17-month low on Wednesday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was initially resilient to the sell-off on China\u2019s mainland markets, but has been falling and on Wednesday suffered its biggest one-day drop since October 2008: all gains since the start of this year have been wiped out. Who is most exposed? Asian countries have strong trade links with China, so stand to lose out if its economy is hit by stock market falls.  Beyond Asian markets, investors in Australia are also starting to feel the effects of the Chinese slump. Australian stock markets have sold off on the back of the Chinese market turmoil and falls in commodity prices. The worry is focused on Australia\u2019s miners, because demand for Australian iron ore and coal will fall if the Chinese economy suffers. The Australian dollar is also under pressure and slumped to a six-year low against the US dollar on Wednesday.   Australia S&amp;P index Australia S&amp;P index   Because China has been such an important driver of global growth, the worries spread beyond Australia. The FTSE 100, where several big miners are listed, has been sensitive to weaker economic news out of China in recent months. The British chancellor, George Osborne, used his budget on Wednesday to highlight the external risks to the British economy, which include China. China is the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest export market and exports to the country have fallen over recent months. British banks have also increased their exposure to China in recent years.  On the other hand, pressure from China\u2019s slowdown on commodity prices could be helpful for those countries more reliant on imports and keep their inflation rates low. Samuel Tombs, the senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe UK economy has little to fear from slower growth in China ... The eurozone crisis is a much more pertinent danger.\u201d So how does the turmoil in China compare with the crisis in Greece? Potentially, the stock market rout in China, with all the political, social and economic risks it entails, could turn out to be a much bigger threat to the global economy than the debt crisis in Greece. Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the currency experts Forex.com, said: \u201cThe sell-off in Chinese stocks in recent weeks makes the volatility in European and US indices look like a walk in the park.\u201d Economists have said that even if the stock market has limited impact on the real economy in China, that economy was already slowing.

Chen Jiahe, chief strategic analyst at Cinda Securities, said this suspension was likely to last until the market was stabilised and liquidity was returned to the market. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said it was not possible to know exactly why so many companies had suspended trading, but that a large number were doing so because they had used their own stock as collateral for loans and wanted to \u201clock in the value for the collateral\u201d. Unlike most other stock markets, where most investors are institutional, in China 80% are small retail investors. Balding said this was raising concerns of \u201cpolitical risk\u201d in Beijing. With large numbers of private investors losing a lot of money, the government would be worried about \u201cpeople protesting on the streets\u201d. As part of the attempt to prevent further losses, China\u2019s state asset regulator had already ordered state-owned enterprises not to sell shares of their listed companies.  The People\u2019s Bank of China said it was assisting the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), the national margin trading service provider \u2013 which helps brokers lend money to institutions to buy shares \u2013 to help steady the market.  It said it would do this through measures such as aiding interbank lending. It would keep a close watch on the market, continue to support the CSFC and guard against systematic and financial risks.  The CSFC said it would buy more shares of small and medium-sized companies, which have suffered the biggest losses.

Across most of the world, stock markets are dominated by professional investors, but in China putting money into the markets had become a mix of entertainment and financial planning for ordinary citizens. More than 90 million people poured money into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, according to Bloomberg news agency, roughly the same number the Chinese communist party counts as members. Many of those who piled in as the market climbed enjoyed the thrill of gambling in a country where more common games of chance are illegal. Some bought shares because the money-making opportunity seemed too good to miss, and others simply because Chinese citizens who want to invest savings are severely constrained in their options.  Stock market fever took such a firm hold that some villages became famous for farmers-turned-investors who spent mornings tracking share prices before returning to back-breaking field labour when the markets closed. Since the rout began, these stories have been replaced by grim reports and rumours of suicides by desperate investors.  Much of the Communist party\u2019s domestic credibility has come from shepherding the country through an economic expansion that has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, so growth and social stability have long been top priorities for Beijing.   Related: Why is China's stock market in crisis?    As uneasiness about the steep decline of share prices accelerated, the government stepped in to try and halt the fall, even though many analysts saw it as no more than an overdue correction to an overheated market. A top regulator warned of a \u201cmood of panic\u201d and officials unveiled a raft of interventions to try and prop up prices. These range from putting an indefinite halt to any new share listings \u2013 forcing anyone who wants to buy stock to invest in companies already on the markets \u2013 to arranging government-supported promises to buy shares on a massive scale. A state-backed company provided 21 brokerages with 260bn yuan ($41.8bn) to buy stock, Reuters reported. But that kind of intervention rows back on promises by the president to pursue reforms to the still state-dominated economy, as he tries to manage a slowdown in growth and the difficult shift from an export economy to one more dependent on domestic consumption.  And if losses deepen they could undermine his own standing as a popular strongman, bolstered by his anti-corruption crusade against some of the most powerful officials in the country.

John McFarlane, the Barclays chairman since April, has form as a slayer of chief executives. While non-executive director at Aviva in 2012, he helped oust the hapless Andrew Moss and filled the chief executive post himself until he found a successor and could revert to being chairman. The demise of Antony Jenkins at Barclays was presented as a decision of all the non-executives, with the deputy chairman, Sir Michael Rake, to the fore, but the final call is always the chairman\u2019s. As at Aviva, McFarlane will become stand-in chief executive, promising an all-action performance more to the liking of shareholders.   Related: Barclays fires chief executive Antony Jenkins    Naturally, investors cheered. They love a no-nonsense boss who promises to slash bureaucracy, improve returns, cut costs and tickle the dividend. \u201cI have experienced good results in dealing with these matters elsewhere\u201d, said McFarlane, less than humbly. Barclays shares rose 3%. Kind words flowed for Jenkins but the gist of the message was clear: not enough energy and too many committees \u2013 375, said McFarlane \u2013 meant better returns for shareholders were in danger of disappearing over the horizon. The new motto is \u201cacceleration\u201d. Up to a point, one can understand the frustration. Jenkins\u2019 brand of woolly management speak often jarred. Few of us ever understood what the ambition to build \u201cthe go-to bank\u201d really meant. On this view, Jenkins, a retail banker, was a useful antidote to Bob Diamond and his crew of muscular investment bankers but lacked the dynamism to give the new-look Barclays a bigger kick. The group\u2019s adjusted pretax profits increased 12% to \u00a35.5bn last year, but statutory profits were down 20%. The investment banking division continued a miserable run with return on of equity of just 2.7%. \u201cI am not a very patient person\u201d, Jenkins declared in March, probably aware that the behind-the-scenes muttering said he was exactly that. But before Jenkins is consigned to history as too ineffectual, consider whether McFarlane\u2019s promised hard-driving approach is any clearer. The motoring metaphor sounds exciting, but what, for example, does it mean for the investment bank? Does it have a future or not?    Related: John McFarlane brings his chainsaw to Barclays    Hard-driving, in McFarlane\u2019s mouth, does not mean what it did in the old days under Diamond. McFarlane will be as aware as Jenkins that the old days brought scandal, monstrous fines and disgrace. So is he a sceptic of the overpaid investment bankers\u2019 ability to earn their keep? Or does he want to take another lap of the track, just in case? Jenkins toyed with the question inconclusively. Thus Barclays\u2019 statement that ditching Jenkins \u201cdoes not signal any major change in strategy\u201d fails to solve the great investment banking conundrum. Outsiders never knew what the strategy was, or how small the division was meant to be, in the first place. Or is hard-driving code for another dose of old-fashioned cost cutting in the retail and commercial banks? There probably will be more of that, just as there was at Aviva. But it is not a risk-free strategy if you also want to grow revenues. A \u201cleaner and more agile\u201d bank may strike punters as one that is understaffed.  Put another way, all banks must serve three masters \u2013 regulators, customers and shareholders. There is no route around regulators these days, so the balance between shareholder and customer demands is critical. McFarlane wants happier shareholders, but the trickier task is to satisfy customers simultaneously. However much McFarlane plays up the parallels with Aviva, the Barclays bus looks harder to handle. China stock market collapse - time to panic? This is what you are not allowed to say in China: the stock market is an equity disaster and the authorities have failed to rescue the market. The phrases \u201cequity disaster\u201d and \u201crescue the market\u201d, you see, have been banned from market reports. For official consumption, the Chinese Communist party is merely adopting sensible measures to address a temporary outbreak of irrationality among investors; calm will return any day now. Yeah, right. Big shareholders have been banned from selling for six months, and trading in almost half the stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges has been suspended, an attempt to air-brush the fact that the real prices would be substantially lower.  It\u2019s hard to guess what the authorities will try next. They have cut interest rates, they have shovelled state pension funds into the market, they have encouraged investors to borrow to speculate, and they have banned flotations. It\u2019s not working because even the most gullible Chinese investor can smell panic. The impossible-to-answer question is why the authorities are so alarmed. It was always odds-on that a market that had risen 150% in a year would crack.

In the past month, the Shanghai Composite Index (essentially its version of Australia\u2019s All Ordinaries Index) has fallen by 30%. The sell-off of stocks prompted the Chinese government to try to stem the tide. At the end of June it cut its official interest rates to 4.85%. This was the fourth such cut this year.  The interest rate is now 115 basis points below the 6.0% it was this time last year, yet the share market keeps falling. On Wednesday the Chinese government got all bolshie and suspended trade in about half the stocks. A state-owned wealth fund began buying just under $20bn worth of shares with a view to hold them until the Shanghai index had risen 20%.  It is sweet to see a communist government, in 2015, try to hold back market forces.  It worked about as well as you would expect. On Wednesday the market opened down 8% on the previous day. It recovered a bit during the day before finishing down 5.9%. Capitalism 1, communism 0.   Related: Why is China's stock market in crisis?    But while this all sounds pretty much like doom, it\u2019s worth noting the Shanghai Composite Index remains 72% above where it was 12 months ago.  The reality is the Chinese stock market was in a massive bubble, fuelled by margin lending (where people borrow to buy shares) and investors seeking better returns as the Chinese property market faltered. Now it is bursting:       How big the burst will be is, as ever, up for debate. Some suggest a lower level may have been found. But the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, which is generally a good guide to how the Chinese market will go, lost 8.5% of its value on Wednesday. Now it is 1.2% below where it was a year ago. Clearly the Shanghai index has grown a tad out of whack with economic reality.  So should we be worried? Well, yeah. In the normal course of events, a fall such as this would not be overly worrying. Clearly a correction was required; stock markets often see a fall after such a rapid rise as we saw this year in China.  Measures the Chinese government has introduced in the past week \u2013 allowing for greater margin lending, suspending stocks, stopping the release of new stock issues \u2013 smell like panic.   Related: Chinese investors despair as gains wiped out in tumbling stock market    You could argue that such was the size of these measures, they themselves helped fuel some of the selling on Wednesday. Panic begets panic. It\u2019s a panic that suggests the Chinese government is more than a bit concerned about the impact of any falls on the broader Chinese economy.  Some commentators have noticed the parallels between China now and the United States in the 1929 Wall Street crash, which also followed large margin lending.  Such talk gets pretty scary, given China accounts for over 30% of Australian exports:       The Chinese economy is not doing well, despite its government\u2019s best efforts to boost growth through easing monetary policy. The latest industrial output figures show annual growth not far above where it was during the GFC:       The sense is that China\u2019s ability to grow off the back of its cheap exports is diminished, given increases in labour and production costs. Thus now it aims to produce more of its growth from internal consumption.  It is becoming less likely that China will be able to reach its target of 7% annual GDP growth. The fall in the share market \u2013 while perhaps not having as huge an impact on people\u2019s wealth as it would in other nations where more people own shares \u2013 will certainly not make for brave spending by Chinese households. China remains a command economy, which gives it ballast against a Great Depression-like outcome. Its financial and economic system is able to essentially ignore economic realities to keep lending and spending.  But that can only happen for so long before reality kicks down the door. This week the share market has shown the limits of the government\u2019s power, and that will not go unnoticed by Chinese consumers.  The Chinese housing market, although slightly better than it was six months ago, is unlikely to gain much strength from this. Declining Chinese consumption growth and a continuing weak housing market spell bad things for our exports.  The latest advice by the office of the chief economist in the Australian government\u2019s Department of Industry noted that \u201cChina\u2019s steel exports remain elevated against expectations but in the absence of a housing recovery, China\u2019s steel production is likely to drop in the short term\u201d.  Forget the housing recovery now, it would seem. And with steel production falls come a fall in iron ore prices \u2013 which have slumped below US$50 a tonne in the past week:       For the moment the price remains above that forecast in the May budget, but the wriggle room is getting small \u2013 and any further falls start to really hit the budget\u2019s projected bottom line. Shrinking as well are the profit margins for mining companies. BHP has a break even price on iron ore of around US$50 a tonne and for Rio Tinto it is in the low US$40s.  One bright spot for us is this is also driving down the value of our dollar \u2013 on Wednesday it went below US75 cents for the first time in six years:       The RBA has been desperate for the dollar to fall to around US 70 cents and, given the likely further fall in iron ore prices, that must now be a real chance. Non-mining exporters will be cheering. But with the falls in those prices also come falls in our national income and concerns that the dollars (both in profits and in tax revenue) from the export side of the mining boom may not be as bountiful as hoped.  As the apocryphal Chinese curse goes: \u201cMay you live in interesting times.\u201d Thanks to China, the times are interesting for anyone trying to manage our economy.

The country\u2019s top brokerages vowed to buy billions of dollars worth of shares last weekend. But the measures appeared to have little effect in the first three days of this week, with the sell-off continuing. The US administration has expressed concerns the stock market crash could delay Beijing\u2019s economic reforms. There are mounting warnings the Chinese stock market rout poses a bigger risk to the global financial system than the Greek debt crisis. Nigel Green, the founder and chief executive of financial consultancy deVere Group, said: \u201cWith the Chinese stock market losing a third of its value since mid-June, which is about equivalent to the UK\u2019s entire economic output last year, this has all the makings of morphing into a major financial crisis. \u201cDespite few foreign investors having much exposure to the Chinese stock markets, the meltdown matters. Indeed, it is hugely significant because it will send shockwaves throughout global capital markets, not least because China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy and one of the largest consumers of commodities and other goods sold by other countries. As such, China, not Greece, is arguably the main cause for concern for investors right now.\u201d Australian financial services firm AMP lambasted Chinese regulators for contributing to the panic sell-off \u2013 the first time a foreign investor has publicly criticised Beijing\u2019s intervention in its markets. The firm\u2019s AMP Capital China Growth Fund, the biggest Australian fund that invests exclusively in China shares, has seen its market value shrink by A$272m to A$440m. However, Chen believes it is important the government is taking some action. The worst thing for a financial market \u201cis not the fluctuation of price, but overall lacking of confidence and liquidity. It needs government action to reverse this kind of situation as it is not a normal situation that can be corrected by the market itself,\u201d he said. In China, some 80% of investors are individuals, many of whom have borrowed from a broker to play the stock market. The past six months have seen a record number of businesses listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, and an explosion in margin trading. This means a broker can ask for more cash or other collateral if the price of securities falls, which is known as a margin call. As regulators have cracked down on margin trading, falling share prices have triggered margin calls \u2013 forcing investors to offload assets to come up with the cash.

The move, announced on Friday after a bilateral meeting at a regional summit in the Russian city of Ufa, brings a slender hope of a thaw in the relationship of the rival nuclear powers. A series of recent rows and a fierce cross-border shelling last year had led most analysts to conclude there was little chance of a detente.  However, a joint statement issued on Friday after the meeting said both leaders recognised their \u201ccollective responsibility to ensure peace and promote development\u201d and included joint commitments on some of the most contentious issues between the two countries. India and Pakistan were split in 1947 when they gained independence from Britain and have fought four wars since.

But the statement said Sharif had reiterated an earlier invitation to Modi, which had been accepted. Many remain sceptical. \u201cThe media always goes overboard when there is any India-Pakistan meeting and obviously if Prime Minister Modi travels to Pakistan next year, you will see the culmination of that. But really, it again goes back to that basic thing [that] if there is any terrorist attack, all this is going to fall down,\u201d said Sameer Patil, a security expert at the Indian Council on Global Relations, a foreign policy thinktank in Mumbai. Modi, who started his career with a hardline Hindu revivalist organisation and has made no secret of his nationalist vision of India\u2019s role in the region and the world, surprised many when he invited Sharif to his inauguration in May last year.  Senior Indian diplomats said the move was intended to gauge Sharif\u2019s power within Pakistan, where decisions on foreign and security policy are effectively taken by the military. Subsequent events \u201cconfirmed our fears\u201d, one Indian diplomat told the Guardian earlier this year. India has long argued that Pakistan shelters and sponsors Islamic militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is accused of being behind the terrorist assault on Mumbai. Pakistan says India has failed to give it crucial evidence to prosecute the organisers of that attack and has repeatedly accused Delhi of backing separatist insurgents in its unsettled south-western state of Balochistan.

Friday\u2019s rebound narrowed the losses on the Shanghai index to 25%. The Chinese authorities have taken a raft of measures over the past week in an attempt to prevent further losses, although analysts are divided on whether the overall effect has been to steady nerves.  The central bank provided 120bn yuan (\u00a312.4bn) to the state-approved China Securities Finance Corporation, which backs brokers making loans to share buyers. Among the most drastic measures included banning shareholders with large stakes in listed firms from selling shares for six months.

The precipitous fall also caused worries it could spill over into the global economy. On Wednesday, before Beijing played its strongest card to stop the rout, Asian shares slid to a 17-month low and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index suffered its worst day since 2008.

Many of China\u2019s small retail investors have borrowed money to invest as it is relatively easy to do so under the system known as margin financing.  Investment bank Credit Suisse estimated that 80% of China\u2019s urban households have put money on the stockmarket in a major shift of household savings from bank accounts to brokerage accounts. Painful losses and panic selling among these millions of small investors has led to concerns about the potential for social instability. \u201cI think social stability is at stake,\u201d said Dong Tao, an economist with Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. \u201cChina has one of the highest ratios for retail investor participation. That is a significant issue and social stability is one of the concerns the government has and why they want to act quickly to stop the panic.\u201d In one of the most drastic of an escalating series of measures, Chinese regulators banned major shareholders in companies from selling their shares for the next six months. Then reports emerged on Friday of police and regulators investigating evidence of potential \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of Chinese shares \u2013 selling borrowed shares in an attempt to drive down the price and profit by buying the shares back once they have fallen.

It will take some time before anyone can say Beijing\u2019s action has been successful. \u201cWhether the measures are big enough, strong enough to stop the panic, I don\u2019t know. But the government has shown a strong determination to make it work.\u201d There has been debate about whether the government should have taken any action at all. \u201cThey have staked their political credibility on something that they may be able to do, which I think is unwise because I don\u2019t think it was necessary,\u201d said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University, said the authorities may have exacerbated the crisis with heavy handed action. \u201cPeople in China got a lot more scared because of what the government is doing. They took a small problem and acted on it and made it a bigger problem,\u201d he said. There has been criticism of Beijing\u2019s tactics in the media, with the highly regarded Caixin magazine publishing an opinion piece that argued only a systemic risk that threatened financial stability justified a government bailout. \u201cGovernment intervention disturbs the price discovery process because it unifies investor expectations and encourages them to make the same choice,\u201d the magazine said. \u201cIn this scenario, investing becomes gambling on the government\u2019s actions.\u201d  Many analysts believe the dizzying rise of share prices over recent months made them overvalued. There are few who think the markets will get back to the unrealistic levels they reached in early June. \u201cI think ultimately they will go back down. The Shanghai index will go back down to somewhere around where it started,\u201d said Chovanec. He expected it to be a drawn out process. \u201cThe last time it took 12 months for that to happen,\u201d he said. But if a plunging stock market has caused financial pain in millions of households and alarm in Beijing, it appears divorced from the course of the wider economy. The massive gains in the markets in the past year came at a time when growth has been slowing to its weakest pace since before the financial crisis.  Chen Jiahe, chief strategist with Cinda Securities, said a stock market crash did not pose an immediate threat to the wider Chinese economy and did not believe China was heading for a meltdown similar to the US crunch that precipitated a global financial crisis in 2008.  \u201cThe leveraging in China\u2019s equity market is still quite low compared to the leveraging in most other markets like the United States, especially when you compare it with the [US] sub prime crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis,\u201d Chen said. But Dong believes that does not mean the stock market rollercoaster will not have an effect on the wider economy. \u201cThe length of the market correction matters more than the depth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it drags on, people might start to feel poor. It is too early to quantify how it is going to effect consumption.\u201d  \u201cThere is an enormous amount of fear in the market,\u201d said Balding. \u201cAs long as there is that level of fear in the marketplace and that level of fear among policymakers, that is not the type of atmosphere that is going to promote a sustainable recovery,\u201d he added.", "tags": ["Chinese economy", "Stock markets", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business", "Global economy", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-10T15:54:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/roger-federer-andy-murray-wimbledon-semi-final", "sentences": ["They have played on hard courts and grass courts, in Cincinnati, Dubai and New York, Madrid, Doha and Shanghai, Sydney, Toronto and Indian Wells."], "title": "Roger Federer unbreakable against Andy Murray in Wimbledon semi-final | Andy Bull", "article": "Ten years now these two have been playing each other. It is a rivalry running back to a match in Bangkok, October 2005. That one, like this, was settled in straight sets. But in between there have been many brilliant matches. There is an old story about two officers in Napoleon\u2019s Army, Dupont and Fournier, who fought a duel when one was made to deliver a disagreeable message to the other. There was no winner and so, each being equally stubborn, they fought again the very next time they met. This time they were interrupted, so again there was no clear conclusion. A third meeting produced a third duel. The feud re-ignited each time they encountered each other ever after. This went on \u2013 no joke \u2013 for three decades. They fought 30 times, on horseback and on foot, with swords and with pistols, on cobbled streets and grassy fields. They came to know each other\u2019s styles so well that they invariably fought to a standstill \u2013 until the day Fournier finally missed, twice, and Dupont had him at gunpoint.   Related: Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final    Andy Murray and Roger Federer are not quite there yet. This was their 24th match. They have played on hard courts and grass courts, in Cincinnati, Dubai and New York, Madrid, Doha and Shanghai, Sydney, Toronto and Indian Wells. And of course, at Wimbledon, the scene of their two most famous matches, back in the summer of 2012, when Federer won one, at the Championships, and Murray the other, in the Olympic final. It is not the most prolific rivalry in men\u2019s tennis \u2013 Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have played each other 44 times. But it is one of the hardest fought. Going into Friday\u2019s match, Federer had won 12 times and Murray 11. There have been long stretches when each man has held the upper hand. Murray won four in a row in 2008 and 2009, as has Federer in 2014 and 2015. Just like Dupont and Fournier they now know each other so well that neither has many surprises left to offer the other. Each knew what to expect in this semi-final, as did most people watching. Federer would try to control the game with his serve and his forehand, would be quick and keen to come to the net to try to close points down and would also look to attack Murray\u2019s weak second serve. Murray, on the other hand, would want to draw Federer into long cross-court rallies with his backhand and use the lob which has won him so many points already in this tournament. So Murray knew what was coming. Not, it turned out, that the knowledge made it any easier to face. At the age of 33, Federer is playing almost as well as ever. Certainly, Murray said, \u201cthat\u2019s definitely the best he served against me\u201d. In the first round at Halle back on 15 June Federer was pushed close by Philipp Kohlschreiber. In the end he won 7-6, 3-6, 7-6, after being 5-3 down in the final set. But late in the match something clicked. Ever since then his serve has been in a rare and record-breaking rhythm. After that he played Ernests Gulbis and Florian Mayer, Ivo Karlovic and Andreas Seppi and was not broken once. Then at Wimbledon he played Damir Dzumhur, Sam Querrey, Sam Groth and Roberto Bautista Agut. Again he went unbroken. In his quarter-final against Gilles Simon Federer broke Wayne Arthur\u2019s 16-year-old record for holding serve in the most consecutive games. Arthur had done it 111 times. Federer\u2019s streak got to 116. And then, finally, he was broken. Just the once, and, Simon said afterwards, it took \u201cthe perfect game\u201d to do it. And of course, Federer immediately broke back. The point is: right now Federer\u2019s serve is almost unassailable. The problem Murray faced, the problem Djokovic will face, is, how, exactly, does one go about beating a man who is unbreakable? As Murray said afterwards, he played OK, better even than that makes him sound. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually play a bad match,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI played pretty well.\u201d But he never came close to finding an answer to that one crucial question. In the first set 85% of Federer\u2019s first serves were in, in the third 81%. Federer has now played 10 matches against 10 men, two of them, Simon and Murray, among the very best returners in tennis, and he has been broken only once. Murray had an opening early on, in the very first game, a break point earned with an exquisite lob and a fine forehand down the line. But the next return went into the net, followed by an error and a service winner. The chance was gone and he did not get another. Federer\u2019s grip on the match got tighter. Murray, on the other hand, seemed always to be scrambling to find a footing. Federer made it all look so easy. The difference was never better illustrated than late in the second set. In the 10th game Federer had five set points. Murray scrambled furiously, saved each and every one, then finally won the game with an ace. In the next game Federer won to love. One game took a little under 10 minutes, the other a little more than 60 seconds. Then the pressure was all back on Murray again. This was the day that Murray, just like Fournier, ended up looking down the barrel of his opponent\u2019s loaded gun and knew that, this time, there was nothing he could do. The other man had won.", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2015", "Roger Federer", "Andy Murray", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-10T19:24:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/12/china-stock-market-turbulence-is-over-dont-count-on-it", "sentences": ["Ten days of falls on the Shanghai stock exchange resulted in losses that exceeded the GDP of Mexico."], "title": "China's stock market turbulence is over? Don't count on it", "article": "The numbers are mind-boggling. Ten days of falls on the Shanghai stock exchange resulted in losses that exceeded the GDP of Mexico. And 12 million Chinese citizens who opened share-trading accounts in May were nursing potentially ruinous losses. Margin trading \u2013 speculating on the stock exchange with borrowed money \u2013 increased five-fold in a year to 2.3tn yuan (\u00a3230bn). While Europe\u2019s focus has been the crisis in Greece, the Chinese stock market has been gripped by panic. The value of shares went up by 150% in little more than a year, then fell by 50% in just a few weeks. Fearful that China in 2015 could find itself in the history books along with Dutch tulips, the South Sea Bubble and the Wall Street Crash, the government in Beijing stepped in to halt the rout. It cut interest rates. It banned large shareholders from selling stock. It used public money to buy equities. It allowed trading in more than half the quoted companies to be halted. And, in the short term at least, it seems to have done the trick. Share prices rose at their fastest pace in more than seven years in the final two days of last week.  Panic over, then? That\u2019s certainly what some China experts believe. They argue that the impact of the boom-bust in shares will have negligible impact on the real economy. Capital Economics, for example, notes that the rise in share prices did not lead to higher consumer spending, so why should the fall in share prices lead to lower consumer spending, particularly since most of the losers are high-net-worth individuals who can afford to take the hit? Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, says the stock market plays little role in funding investment in China. This, he adds, is just one of the \u201cusual panics and manias to which young financial markets are even more prone than established ones\u201d. This optimistic assessment could well be correct. After all, the US suffered many boom-busts in the 19th century and they failed to arrest an upward trend that turned an agrarian economy in 1800 into the world\u2019s biggest industrial power by the outbreak of the first world war. Keynes once wrote: \u201cSpeculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.\u201d China, if the optimists are right, is not a casino and the speculation is froth. Naturally enough, there is an alternative view, which is that the false and disorderly stock market is indicative of a deeper malaise, and that the current state of China is little different from the US in the years before the financial crash of 2007. Both appeared strong, both used inflated asset prices to stimulate growth and disguise fundamental weaknesses in the economy. Alan Greenspan dealt with the fallout from one burst bubble by inflating another. Something similar has been going on in China, where the response to the global financial crisis was to build inefficient industrial plant and infrastructure that was not really needed, while at the same time using cheap and over-abundant credit to boost property prices. Russell Jones at Llewellyn Consulting says periods of asset price excess are most serious when combined with a credit boom, and that China is the most obvious current example of such a phenomenon. Jones says the risk is that the Chinese authorities struggle to contain the stock market turbulence with the result that broader indicators of business and consumer confidence decline and GDP growth drops below the 7% target. There would, he adds, be a good chance that neighbouring countries, many of them also displaying bubble-like tendencies, would be affected. The Chinese authorities won plaudits for their handling of the 2008-09 crisis and may well emerge from this period of turbulence with their reputation intact. They will be helped by the fact that China runs a trade surplus, has strong public finances and has massive reserves. Even so, the lesson of history is that the worst crises are those where excessive credit has led to excessive leverage: investors throw caution to the wind and borrow money in the expectation that asset prices can only ever go up. This lesson holds true not just for the 2008-08 crash but \u2013 according to a 2010paper by an economic research body, the the National Bureau of Economic Research \u2013 for the whole era of modern finance capitalism. The authors of the paper studied the relationship between asset prices and the performance of the economy in 17 countries over 140 years and found that what turned a bit of irrational froth into something really nasty was when the irrational exuberance was combined with plenty of easy credit. This is where things in China start to look a bit worrying. The Bank for International Settlements, the body that represents central banks, has developed a set of indicators to assess whether countries are at risk of a financial crisis. One is whether the ratio of credit to national income (GDP) is more than 10% higher than its long-term trend. A second is whether real (inflation adjusted) share prices are more than 40% above their long-term trend. A third is whether property prices are more than 10% above their long-term trend. The results for China are not good. The credit gap rose from 12.7% to 14.2% in 2014. The equity gap remained only just below the 40% threshold following the boom in share prices in 2014 and early 2015. And the real property price gap was 10.5% in 2014, albeit down from 23.7% in 2014. China\u2019s leaders clearly have a problem. They understand that their country\u2019s growth model has to change and become less reliant on investment. Consumer spending has fallen from 50% of GDP \u2013 low by western standards \u2013 to 35% since Deng Xiaoping began his reform programme a little more than three decades ago. Moving to a model where growth is slower but of higher quality is not easy. As Bob Swarup of advisory firm Camdor Global, has noted, to maintain growth rates at the current target of just over 7% while returning household consumption to 50% of GDP within a decade would require consumer spending to rise by 11.5% a year. The task is complicated because China\u2019s authoritarian regime is fearful that economic distress will fuel political unrest. That\u2019s why there is always the strong temptation \u2013 even for a reformist administration like that of the premier, Li Keqiang, to resort to the old growth-at-any-price ways when things start to look a bit dicey. As they do now.

Related: China's stock market turbulence is over? Don't count on it    Drastic official efforts over the past two weeks, including a ban on sales by executives and big shareholders, appear to have at least temporarily halted the decline that wiped out $3.8tn (\u00a32.45tn) in investor wealth. On Monday, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed up 2.4%, its third daily rise in succession, although it remained 23% below the peak of 12 June. The stock market regulator ordered brokers to sever all ties with the unlicensed companies that lend money to finance trading. It also accused brokers of improperly allowing customers to trade without giving their real names or subdivide accounts to allow others to use them to trade. The stock market boom began last year after the state press said shares were cheap, which led investors to believe Beijing would intervene to prop up prices if needed. But recent changes in banking regulations led to fears among investors that the government may withdraw its support and the market could begin to collapse. Regulators also deepened investors\u2019 anxiety by tightening controls on lending to finance trading. Novice investors who rushed into the market near the peak have suffered heavy losses, souring sentiment towards stock investment. The price collapse could frustrate the Communist party\u2019s plans to encourage the public to buy stocks and raise money for state companies to pay off debts and become more competitive. More than 1,000 of the 2,802 companies traded on the mainland\u2019s exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen have suspended trading in their shares following the plunge in prices.

That won\u2019t be an issue for Universal\u2019s irrepressible Minions, whose current $395.7m (\u00a3235m) worldwide gross already puts it within spitting distance of parent film Despicable Me\u2019s $543.1m total, after just four weekends. Minions finally opened in the US this frame, with $115.2m comfortably surpassing the recent $90.4m for Pixar\u2019s Inside Out (which cost twice as much) and snatching the second highest animation debut of all time (behind Shrek the Third\u2019s $121.6m). As noted here a fortnight ago, the dungareed yellow critters have a far higher degree of brand awareness than Puss-in-Boots and Madagascar\u2019s Penguins, which is why talk of $1bn for this spin-off ain\u2019t idle. (That would make it the third such 10-digiter for an on-fire Universal in 2015, after Furious 7 and Jurassic World.) The only question mark is whether the manic and one-dimensional Minions will hold as well through the summer as the two Despicables, which also opened in July but whose soft-centred sentiment gave them broader-than-expected appeal. But the huge start promises a US take in the order of a minimum $300m; on the current 70.9% international split, that points to $1bn overall and possibly more, with many territories yet to kick off.            The film team review Despicable Me 2    Franchises tend to proportionally gross more overseas with each instalment, especially with the US gross usually falling off, but if Minions can combine that trend with improved takings across the board, it\u2019ll confirm Despicable Me\u2019s position as the dominant animation franchise of the 2010s. This week\u2019s debuts suggest it\u2019s happening, with figures from Mexico ($19.7m) and Russia ($14.3m) that are 32% and 17% up respectively on Despicable Me 2. So far it\u2019s opened at No 1 in every single country, apart from Australia, where it clashed with Jurassic Park, and India, where local hero Baahubali (see below) was too strong. If it hangs in as well as Despicable Me 2 and beats that film\u2019s $970.8m, it\u2019ll be interesting to see the impact on Despicable Me 3 in 2017. The shift in focus back towards glum evil mastermind Gru could be an anticlimax after the babbling yellow takeover. Telugu champion            It\u2019s been a slow year financially for Indian cinema, with box-office watchers waiting until late May for romcom sequel Tanu Weds Manu Returns to finally break the 100-crore mark ($15.7m) for local films. Unexpectedly, it\u2019s the Telugu industry \u2013 generally a notch down on takings from Bollywood \u2013 that has provided the first true barnstormer of 2015, in the shape of SS Rajamouli\u2019s epic saga of a deposed king, Baahubali. Being touted as the most expensive Indian film ever certainly didn\u2019t dampen its prospects (though the $40m budget was technically split over two parts), and early reports suggest it has monstered the 108-crore ($17m) debut weekend record set last Diwali by Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s Happy New Year.    Related: Baahubali: The Beginning review \u2013 fantastic\u00a0bang for your buck in most expensive Indian movie ever made    Friday and Saturday saw takings for Baahubali (also filmed in Tamil, and dubbed into Hindi and Malayalam) in the order of 135 crore, and a Hindustan Times piece has pegged the whole weekend at 165 crore ($26m). Worldwide figures aren\u2019t yet available, but it took $3m in the US, within a whisker of the $3.5m for Aamir Khan\u2019s religious satire PK, the highest-grossing Indian film worldwide. So Baahubali should have placed in the vicinity of sixth or seventh on the global chart, minimum. Most heartening is that Rajamouli\u2019s film was warmly reviewed: the Guardian called it \u201ca near-perfect balance between physicality and poetics\u201d, and Times of India said \u201cthe larger-than-life execution matches [Rajamouli\u2019s] grandiose vision\u201d. So, in contrast to the likes of Happy New Year \u2013 which the old Bollywood razzle-dazzle routine couldn\u2019t prevent from dropping off embarrassingly \u2013 Baahubali has a shot at setting a box-office record for the ages. Or at least until part two, next year. Fast and Furiosa           Charlize Theron talks to Catherine Shoard about Mad Max: Fury Road    In a quiet week on the new global-release front, a pause to consider the after-effects of one of the year\u2019s most startling performances. Everyone seemed in agreement that Charlize Theron\u2019s embattled Furiosa, not Tom Hardy\u2019s haunted Max, was the true star of Fury Road. With its theatrical run more or less done now \u2013 $359.5m worldwide, making the $150m film a modest success \u2013 what impact will it have on her career? This intense performer has anchored plenty of substantial material (North Country, The Burning Plain, Young Adult), and in the wake of her 2004 Oscar win for Monster, found herself in bankable blockbuster territory once before with sci-fi thriller Aeon Flux. That, making $52m on a $62m budget, didn\u2019t work out \u2013 and is perhaps why Warner Bros thought she wasn\u2019t a surefire marketing element for Fury Road, whose feminist aspect went completely uncommunicated prior to the first reviews. But Theron deserves credit for spurring the fourth Mad Max film to the frenzied pitch that made it such a treat. So, equally, she deserves a mainstream project that not only exploits her natural screen authority, but is set up as a true test of her bankability \u2013 and is promoted accordingly. Fury Road \u2013 which might have taken more if it had explicitly targeted female filmgoers \u2013 surely has earned Theron the benefit of any doubt. At 39, she may not get many more chances. Beyond Hollywood            Other than Korean north-south thriller NLL: Battle of Yeonpyeong, holding firm in its third week just outside the global top 10, it was all Chinese traffic taking advantage of the country\u2019s Hollywood blackout period. In a big week for the present roaring trade in lightweight, gooey, coming-of-age hankie-dabbers, newcomer Forever Young edged out the fourth entry in the prolific Tiny Times franchise, about four Shanghai BFFs, $38.1m to $36m. The former is the feature-length debut of TV host He Jiong, spinning out a hit song he recorded a few years ago into a tale of performing-school love and woes. The Sydney Morning Herald review intriguingly suggests that, were it not for the censor board, the film might be more inclined to delve further into its lingering homoerotic undertone. In 10th place on the global chart, with $10m, was Monkey King: Hero Is Back, a 3D animated take on the apparently indefatigable local literary linchpin last seen in Donnie Yen\u2019s box office-conquering version early last year. Down in 12th place, Chen Kaige\u2019s neo-wuxia Monk Comes Down the Mountain, covered in last week\u2019s column, dropped a pretty precipitous 78% \u2013 possibly hounded out by the flashier contemporary offerings. The future            Marvel closes Phase 2 of operations, hoping to repeat last summer\u2019s out-of-leftfield Guardians of the Galaxy triumph with the similarly goofy Ant-Man, and shrinking Paul Rudd in order to elevate him to blockbuster leading-man status \u2013 surely the first such inverted tack on star-making since Rick Moranis and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids? This new, potentially tender shoot of the Marvel meta-franchise, opening day-and-date in 50 territories, has tough competition from Minions. A box-office return at the lower end of the spectrum for the company (somewhere between the $65.7m for Thor and $94.3m for Guardians) looks more likely for its US debut. Pixels, Sony\u2019s hipster-friendly blockbuster in which Earth is under attack from a blocky Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and other 80s arcade denizens, pops a first coin in the slot in South Korea, before a 40-something-country rollout the following frame. And Bollywood stumps up some proper competition for Baahubali in the shape of Salman Khan\u2019s latest, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, on release to capitalise on the Muslim superstar and Alan Cumming lookalike\u2019s fan base as Ramadan winds up. With Khan\u2019s appeal against a five-year-sentence for running over a homeless man still hanging over him, the new film\u2019s plot \u2013 a magnanimous Indian fella helps a stranded, mute Pakistani woman get back over the border \u2013 has the awkward ring of a timely public-relations overture.

Quinten Taylor was moved to spend a lunchtime trawling the web, and came up with Frank Worthington, who, he said, \u201cdonned blue and white at least eight times, for six league clubs.\u201d We reckon it\u2019s actually 11 times, with a list that includes Huddersfield Town, Bolton Wanderers, Leicester City, Birmingham City, Leeds United (if we\u2019re allowed a dash of yellow), Brighton, Tranmere Rovers, Preston, Stockport County, Stalybridge Celtic and Guiseley. \u201cHe was also player-coach at Halifax Town,\u201d said Quinten. They had a sky-blue and white kit at the time. \u201cBut sadly he didn\u2019t get any playing time.\u201d Quinten also nominated Glenn Cockerill, who played almost 300 times for Southampton but was rarely to be found out of red and white in his 22-year career. Lincoln City were kitted out in red and white stripes in the late 1970s, while Swindon Town welcomed him in red shirts and white shorts. Sheffield United, his next club after another stint at Lincoln, hadn\u2019t been out of red and white stripes since 1891. Cockerill\u2019s three-year stay at Leyton Orient coincided with a particularly bad set of home shirts (here he is wearing the Akklaim shirt of 1995-96, for instance). Cockerill finished his career at Brentford, back in the familiar red and white vertical stripes and black shorts. We make that six different clubs. Another player with a predilection for red and white stripes was Danny Higginbotham, nominated by James Murton, having turned out for Southampton, Stoke, Sunderland and Sheffield United. \u201cAdditionally, if we\u2019re talking basic colours and not identical designs,\u201d said James, \u201che has also had loan spells with Royal Antwerp and Nottingham Forest, both of whom of course play in red with white as a secondary colour.\u201d This also surely allows Manchester United, where Higginbotham began his club career, as well as Altrincham, where he finished it. The defender even came out of retirement to don the red and white of Gibraltar, making a grand total of eight clubs and one country. Paul Vickers suggested Steve Claridge: \u201cIn a long career, Claridge played for four teams in blue: Birmingham City, Leicester City, Portsmouth and Millwall.\u201d Given that Claridge played for 8,293 different clubs, it seemed odd that he only four times ended up in blue, so we did a bit of digging. Strictly speaking, Brighton were in stripes when he was there, but we\u2019re pretty sure he made his one appearance for Gillingham in a solid blue kit, which would make it five. No upgrade for Tony Cottee, though. He played in the blue of four clubs: Everton, Leicester City, Birmingham City and Millwall. A couple of other league journeymen worth a mention are Marcus Bent, who also played for four blue-clad clubs \u2013 Ipswich, Everton, Birmingham and Leicester \u2013 and Wigan, although that was in their blue and white striped phase. Bent is put in the shade by Trevor Benjamin, who has racked up seven different blue kits, albeit only three of them at Football League sides. The full list: Leicester, Gillingham, Peterborough United, Gainsborough Trinity, Kidsgrove Athletic, Wroxham and Glossop North End. Nick Hailstone put forward Rory Delap, naming the same three red-and-white clubs for whom Ian Maguire put forward Kenwyne Jones: Southampton, Sunderland and Stoke City. By our reckoning, Delap has four, having also appeared in the current red shirt and white shorts combo of Barnsley, while Jones has continued his love affair with the colour red, adding Bournemouth and the controversially red-attired Cardiff City in recent years. Staying in the modern age, Nicolas Anelka could offer an exotic range of blue shirts, having turned out for PSG, Chelsea, Shanghai Shenhua and Mumbai City. You could add Manchester City, Fenerbahce and West Brom as other blue-tinged teams the Frenchman played for, but that may be pushing it.  Gervinho is on a run of four straight teams that play in a shade of red: Le Mans, Lille, Arsenal and Roma. Former team-mate Robin van Persie, meanwhile, will end a 14-year run in red and white by joining Fenerbahce, having turned out for Feyenoord, Arsenal and Manchester United since 2001. In this modern era of ever-changing shirt styles, you\u2019d be hard pushed to beat the record of Luca Toni. The Italian veteran striker may not top Worthington, but he has played for seven clubs whose predominant colour is blue \u2013 Empoli, Lodigiani, Brescia, Genoa, Al Nasr and Hellas Verona \u2013 not to mention the famous Azzurri of the Italian national team. PRE-SEASON DUCK \u201cNotts County striker Lee Hughes missed the start of pre-season training after getting a mild case of the bends scuba diving on his honeymoon,\u201d wrote Daniel West back in the good old days of 2011. \u201cAre there any similarly outlandish reasons for footballers avoiding the annual punishment of the pre-season fitness regime?\u201d Croatian striker Milan Rapaic once missed the start of Hajduk Split\u2019s season when he managed to stick his boarding pass in his eye in an airport. Not the sort of aim you\u2019d want from a striker. Josh Clarke is also on hand to help out. \u201cHearing about Lee Hughes and his holiday incident instantly made me think of two Sunderland players injuring themselves in recent years,\u201d says Josh. \u201cIn 2004 Julio Arca got stung by a jellyfish while on Roker Beach. Then in 2008 Paul McShane broke his knee whilst \u2018on holiday\u2019 \u2013 the cause was not stated.\u201d Dave Bailey also has some answers. \u201cI remember checking www.physioroom.com at the start of one season, and was amused by some of the excuses injuries ruling out Everton players from pre-season. One of my favourites was Tony Hibbert, who had come down with a case of the horrific sounding \u2018Cryptosporidium Parasite\u2019.\u201d But if you think that\u2019s bad, you\u2019ve heard nothing yet. \u201cLast summer Port Vale\u2019s Lewis Haldane got bitten by an insect and not only missed pre-season but also the first three months of the season,\u201d says Nigel Stubbs. Meanwhile Liverpool\u2019s woes at left-back become a little clearer after reading this. \u201cFabio Aur\u00e9lio managed to injure himself before pre-season,\u201d says Tim Hill. \u201cHe managed this feat by playing beach soccer with his children and was out for a good three months returning around six weeks into the season.\u201d Keith Moss is on hand to remind us of a famous story. \u201cThis is probably my favourite injury of all time,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 1993 Dave Beasant missed a good chunk if not all of pre-season training for Chelsea after dropping a bottle of Salad Cream on his foot at home. It\u2019s all the funnier considering he was a goalkeeper and what\u2019s more, had been responsible for some atrocious howlers during the 1992-93 season, particularly a game against Norwich City when Chelsea lost 3-2 at home as a result of two woeful blunders by Beasant.\u201d It may not count as an injury, but Wayne Rooney has admitted to summer excess affecting his early season form. In the classic tome, My Decade in the Premier League, Rooney confessed to turning up for pre-season training seven pounds overweight in 2009. The reason? \u201cI drank a few bevvies while I was away.\u201d PREMIER LEAGUE ABSENTEES \u201cWith the first Premier League matches ticked off my list, an old sinking feeling revisited me as I realised that, again, the league would not be dazzled/enriched by the presence of at least one Indian/Indian-origin player,\u201d wrote Vivek in August 2012. \u201cThis got me thinking \u2013 apart from India, is there another country that has never been represented in the Premier League by its players?\u201d The good news, Vivek, is that India are far from alone. Only 99 of the 209 nations currently listed in the Fifa world rankings have managed to produce a Premier League footballer. India are also not the highest-ranked country without a Premier League player to their name. That hotly contested honour goes to Panama (ranked No62) who just edge out Equatorial Guinea (No63). You have go all the way down to No156 in the world to find India. Now for the bad news: India are still keeping Vivek waiting almost three years on. In fact, in that time only three Fifa-ranked nations have joined the Premier League party: Kenya (represented by Southampton\u2019s Victor Wanyama), the Gambia (Swansea\u2019s Modou Barrow) and Venezuela (Fulham\u2019s Fernando Amorebieta \u2013 born in the South American country, but Basque enough to play for Athletic Bilbao).  Also worth a mention are Gibraltar (represented by \u2013 him again \u2013 Danny Higginbotham, but not yet a member of Fifa) and Cape Verde. Cabral became the first Cape Verde-born player to grace the Premier League when he made his first, and indeed last, Sunderland appearance in the 2013/14 opening day home defeat to Fulham. Cabral followed plastic Cabo Verdean Pel\u00e9, who was born in Portugal and turned out for West Brom in 2008. India is also both the biggest and most populous country to have failed to churn out a Premier League player. Indonesia, No4 on the population list, and Kazakhstan, world No9 in terms of size, are India\u2019s nearest rivals in those regards. When it comes to GDP per capita, however, Qatar and Luxembourg are the countries who come off worst. Or best. Depending on your point of view.

And, of course, investment in the schools\u2019 passions, be it drama, music or sport. So how much do top institutions actually make and spend? We take a glimpse at the financial accounts of four private schools \u2013 Eton College, Harrow school, Wellington College and Charterhouse \u2013 as published on the Charity Commission website.  Eton College Accounts year to 31 August 2014 Total income: \u00a362m (\u00a356m - 2013)Expenditure: \u00a359m (\u00a355m)Gross school fees: \u00a344m (\u00a342m)Fee remission: \u00a35.8m (\u00a35.2m)Fee reductions: 21% of pupils (20%) Number of pupils: 1,300+ (aged 13-18) Like many private schools, Eton\u2019s fees make up a big proportion of its total income. Take away the scholarships, bursaries and discounts on pre-paid fees and you get the net fees of \u00a338m, which accounted for 60% of total incoming resources in 2014.   Related: 10 interview questions for teachers applying to private schools    Teaching (\u00a318m), premises (\u00a316m), boarding and welfare (\u00a310m) costs took the biggest chunks of spending in 2014. Around \u00a333m was spent on the staff during the same period. This includes almost \u00a31m which was spent on agency staff, medical services and external sporting coaches.  According to the school\u2019s latest financial statements, 123 of its 916 employees earned more than \u00a360,000 per annum, including taxable benefits in kind, with the highest earner in the \u00a3220,000-\u00a3229,999 pay bracket. It\u2019s also a costly business for the school to maintain its 398 buildings \u2013 78 of which are listed. Premise costs rose to almost \u00a316m in the year to 31 August 2014, up from just over \u00a313m the previous year. This was mainly attributed to a \u201cparticularly significant spend on renovation of listed buildings.\u201d  The school which has educated 19 prime ministers, including David Cameron, also had a direct property portfolio of \u00a370m at the end of August 2014 \u2013 rising by \u00a38m during the year.  Harrow school Accounts year to 31 August 2014 (Harrow school, The John Lyon school, Harrow School Enterprises, Harrow International Schools Limited and Harrow Development Trust)  Total income: \u00a355.1m (\u00a347.3m - 2013)Expenditure: \u00a328m (\u00a327m) \u2013 Harrow schoolGross school fees: \u00a327.4m (\u00a326.3m) \u2013 Harrow schoolFee remission: \u00a32.2m (\u00a32.3m) \u2013 scholarships and bursaries, Harrow school Number of pupils: 830 (aged 13-18) School fees at this exclusive boys boarding school are the primary source of revenue. In terms of bursaries, \u00a31.84m was spent in 2013-14 to help 87 students, while the previous year saw 85 pupils receive bursaries that totalled around \u00a31.9m.  The school, which is home to some 830 boys, had main running costs of \u00a327.4m, including teaching (\u00a310m), premises (\u00a39.5m), welfare (\u00a35.3m) and support (\u00a33.4m). Support includes central administration staff and overheads. The annual accounts even goes as far as to calculate the amount the school saves the state (at least around \u00a34m during the year) and lists the general public as a key beneficiary.  Investment in cricket is also taken very seriously. The Harrow School Cricket Fund, set up in order to help the governors provide high \u201cquality cricketing\u201d, gives approximately \u00a315,000 to the school each year, although this varies.  Wellington College Accounts year to 31 July 2014 (includes the college and its five funds, Eagle House and subsidiaries such as WC Enterprises and International) Total income: \u00a346m (\u00a343m \u2013 2013). Includes donationsExpenditure: \u00a341.7m (\u00a338.2m)Gross school fees: \u00a338m (\u00a336m)Fee remission: \u00a32.55m (\u00a32.61m)Fee reductions: 22% of students at Wellington College (25%) Number of pupils: 1,050 (Wellington College, 13-18), 370 (Eagle House, 3-13) This co-educational day and boarding school for boys and girls was founded in 1853. The school, which charged day fees of \u00a38,350 per term and boarding fees of \u00a311,375 per term in 2013-14, awarded scholarships to 259 students (based on educational merit and potential), with 76 of these also qualifying for a means-tested bursary.  Income for the school, its five funds, prep school Eagle House and subsidiaries, such as WC Enterprises and International, amounted to \u00a346m in the year to the end of July 2014 \u2013 up from \u00a343m the previous year. Expenditure, which includes resources used to support Wellington Academy, totalled \u00a341.7m in 2013-14. Total teaching costs in 2014 were \u00a317.9m, with the average number of teaching staff during this period being 185. Almost \u00a310m was spent on premises, around \u00a35m on welfare (including things such as catering and domestic costs for boarding) and \u00a34.6m on support costs. The latest report also details plans for a second international school in Shanghai, China, which is planned to open this year.    Related: Diversity among private school students is rising but heads aren't following suit    Charterhouse Accounts year to 31 July 2014 Total income: \u00a328m (\u00a327m \u2013 2013)Expenditure: \u00a326m (\u00a325m)Gross school fees (including music fees): \u00a325.4m (\u00a324.3m)Fee remission: \u00a31.6m (\u00a31.8m) \u2013 scholarships plus bursariesFee reductions: 281 awards made (271)  Number of pupils: 804 (aged 13-18) Gross school fees (including music fees) came in at \u00a325.4m in 2014. Almost \u00a31.2m was spent on bursaries and another \u00a3421,000 on scholarships and awards that benefitted 281 pupils. In 2013-14, day boarders paid \u00a39,070 per term, while boarders fees came in at \u00a310,975 per term.  Teaching costs amounted to near \u00a311m in 2014, a slight rise on 2013, while \u00a34.4m was spent on welfare and \u00a35.6m on premises. In 2014, 47 employees had total employee benefits (excluding employer pension costs) of more than \u00a360,000 per annum, with the highest earner receiving \u00a3210,001 \u2013 \u00a3220,000 (total employee benefits). The school, which prides itself on its students sporting abilities, describes the appointment of a new full-time director of sport in its annual accounts. It also notes that, as the number of girls at the school continues to increase, sport for girls has become a key focus.  The Working in Independent Schools series is funded by the IAPS.

The rapidly inflating bubble that had driven share prices to dizzying heights had suddenly burst. By this spring, the stock markets in Shanghai, with 831 listed companies, and Shenzhen, with 1,700, boasted a combined market capitalisation of $9.5tn, which made them \u2013 along with the much older Hong Kong exchange \u2013 the second-largest financial market in the world. After languishing for the past four years, these two Chinese stock markets suddenly took off last summer, becoming a cauldron of voracious buying, selling and spectacular profit-taking. Shares of newly listed companies soared thousands of percentage points within months of their initial public offerings, driven upward by a new and growing cadre of relatively unsophisticated private investors that included tens of millions of ordinary workers, farmers, housewives and pensioners. According to one widely cited survey of these new investors, 67% of them have less than a high-school education.   Related: Why is China's stock market in crisis?    The fact that Chinese stocks were climbing ever higher while the Chinese economy was cooling should have been an unmistakable warning of a bubble, but it caused surprisingly little concern. (Another reason to worry might have been the disparity in prices between so-called \u201cA-shares\u201d, which can only be purchased by investors inside China to keep the domestic market shielded from outside foreign manipulation, and stakes in the same companies available to foreign investors through the Hong Kong exchange, known as \u201cH-Shares\u201d. This disparity suggested Chinese investors were bidding up prices well beyond any reasonable approximation of their value.) In fact, drawn by the casino-like profits to be made in the boom, more and more small investors flocked to the thousands of brokerage houses that are now proliferating in every Chinese city in order to buy and sell while staring up at flickering electronic data boards charting the rise and fall of equity prices. With markets rising in straight lines on graphs plotting their progress \u2013 the Shanghai exchange had shot up some 135%, and the Shenzhen exchange had gone even higher at 150% in less than a year \u2013 stocks had begun to seem like a sure bet for Chinese investors with fevered dreams of quick wealth. They promised a much higher rate of return than traditional low-interest bank savings accounts, which have paltry annual yields of barely 2%. At the time of the crash, 9% of Chinese households \u2013 some report the figure as high as 200 million people \u2013 had bought into the booming market. Steadily rising prices seemed to be delivering on both Deng Xiaoping\u2019s promise of \u201ca relatively well-off society\u201d (xiaokang shehui) and the current president Xi Jinping\u2019s rhetoric of a full-blown \u201cChinese dream\u201d (zhongguo meng) \u2013 a fuzzy notion that promises wealth, wellbeing, and power to individuals and the nation as a whole. China had already experienced a dangerous bubble in its residential housing market, but in that case the government had succeeded in engineering a relatively soft landing by raising interest rates, limiting the number of residences one owner could buy in such cities as Beijing and Shanghai and levying a new tax. Accordingly, it was all too easy for small investors to assume that the bull market was implicitly backed by a kind of unwritten government guarantee \u2013 that the good times were only beginning to roll, and the state would step in to take care of things before the bottom fell out. In fact, the government itself had become bedazzled by the seemingly invincible rise in stock prices. Instead of dedicating its energy to regulating the markets, the Chinese Communist party began to see an unprecedented opportunity in further inflating the bubble \u2013 a chance to sell equity stakes in dangerously debt-burdened state enterprises and help clean up some very messy balance sheets. If the planting of two stock markets on soil long ploughed by Maoist sloganeering about \u201ccapitalist roaders\u201d was a mild surprise, it was mind-bending to witness the party embrace the bull market so ardently that even its official voice, the People\u2019s Daily, began to flog stocks as a golden risk-free opportunity. When the Shanghai index reached a new pinnacle of 4,000 in April, a column in the People\u2019s Daily effused that this \u201cwas only the start of a bull market\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bubble?\u201d it asked insouciantly. \u201cTulips and bitcoins are bubbles \u2026 But if A-shares are seen as the bearer of the Chinese dream, then they contain massive investment opportunities.\u201d With the party cheerleading the market\u2019s inexorable rise, it became even easier to imagine that the government was, in effect, declaring an informal debt obligation on the stock market\u2019s future \u2013 essentially covering any bets with its own considerable assets. How could you lose? And so the bubble grew and grew: price-to-earnings ratios for Chinese stocks averaged an astounding 70-to-1, against a worldwide average of 18.5 to 1; the value of the A-shares inside China grew to be nearly double the equivalent shares of the same companies on the Hong Kong exchange. Ordinary Chinese people had become so intoxicated by bull-market euphoria that stories began to proliferate about people leaving their jobs, and even their families, to become day traders, often using funds borrowed from high-interest rate \u201cshadow banks\u201d or loans taken out against their homes. (By last weekend, margin borrowing on both exchanges had surpassed $320bn, representing almost 10% of the total market capitalisation of all stocks being traded.)    Ordinary Chinese had become so intoxicated by bull-market euphoria that stories spread about people leaving their jobs    Of course, some observers could see the inherent weakness in this seemingly irrepressible market, but with so much money to be made, it was easy to ignore or disparage warnings of anomalies and irregularities. Few wanted to ruin the heady ride with naysaying and pessimism, particularly as some 7% of households had invested 15-20% of all their assets in shares. When the World Bank released its China Economic Update Report this spring, noting that the state had gone beyond its role as a regulator and guarantor for financial systems and engaged in more active interference, its officials met with strong opposition from the Chinese government. \u201cInstead of promoting the foundations for sound financial development,\u201d the World Bank\u2019s report cautioned, \u201cthe state has interfered extensively and directly in allocating resources through administrative and price controls, guarantees, credit guidelines, pervasive ownership of financial institutions and regulatory policies.\u201d It was a prescient warning, given what followed. But almost immediately after the report appeared, the chapter containing these cautions suddenly vanished: unspecified Chinese officials had taken umbrage at such direct criticism, and forced the World Bank to redact the offending portion of its analysis. Chinese officialdom has often had difficulty accepting criticism \u2013 especially from outside experts in a public setting \u2013 and whether this critical shortcoming is a consequence of traditional mores or a Leninist political culture is hard to determine. However, such sensitivities have frequently prevented Chinese officials from identifying and fixing problems before they erupt into crises. In the case of China\u2019s stock market bubble, almost no one wanted to listen to voices of caution \u2013 and the whole country was to pay a bitter price for avoiding reality. For what was at stake was not just the integrity of China\u2019s financial system, but the question of the Chinese people\u2019s ongoing confidence in their government. This would be critical as the country continued, in Deng Xiaoping\u2019s words, \u201cto cross the river by feeling its way over the stones\u201d (mozhe shitou guohe). Indeed, there is no nation of significance in the world today that is in the process of undergoing a more challenging transition: from Maoist revolution to stakeholder in the modern, marketised global world.

Photograph: Reuters/China Daily    * * * When the Shanghai stock exchange composite index plunged from its high of 5,166 to just about 3,700 over the course of a few short weeks in June and early July \u2013 wiping out some $3tn worth of market value \u2013 its precipitous fall stunned the nation. The collective sense of shock owed something to the fact that over the past 25 years, China had not encountered many economic crises that officials found impossible to handle through state intervention. So, when this one began, the natural reaction was to attempt to \u201cmanage\u201d the collapsing share prices through more state intervention, beginning with a surprise interest rate cut on 27 June. As if the stock markets were still just cogs in a socialist command economy, the government then ordered up a whole menu of non-market fixes: first, a moratorium on all new public offerings; then, on 8 July, a six-month prohibition on share sales by company directors or any listed shareholder owning a 5% stake in that company. By this time, more than half of the listed companies on the two Chinese exchanges had suspended trading of their own stocks; state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were instructed not to sell shares. At the same time, the China Securities Regulatory Commission created a \u201cmarket stabilisation fund\u201d of $19.3bn and ordered brokerage houses to start buying into the market themselves. The commission also relaxed rules on margin trading so that government pension funds and other SOEs could also answer the party\u2019s call to prop up the market themselves by buying shares; it lowered securities trading fees; and even promised to purchase shares through its own proprietary accounts, and to continue doing so for as long as the composite index for both exchanges remained below the new target of 4,500. To reassure \u201cthe people\u201d that the government had not turned bearish on the foundering markets, the People\u2019s Daily again rhapsodised about the glories of investment over \u201cthe long term\u201d: \u201cIt is after storms that we encounter rainbows,\u201d it wrote. \u201cLooking back at the development of China\u2019s capital market, we realise that the road to development has not always been smooth, but has instead been a twisting one with ups and downs. But it is in each lesson learned that the market has matured \u2026 So participants in the market should earnestly reflect, collectively sum up their experiences, and then work together to achieve a capital market that is stable and can continue to develop in a healthy manner over the long term.\u201d But such florid rhetoric was too little and too late to soothe the agitated investors who had just lost their shirts. Not surprisingly, the unofficial press and the internet had erupted with the sentiments of people furious about both their financial losses and what they regarded as the Communist party\u2019s poor leadership. One young investor in Manchuria blamed \u201cthe state\u2019s inadequate regulation\u201d, and pointed to the government\u2019s role in inflating the bubble as a reason for it to forcefully intervene to prop up prices. \u201cThe bull market was itself a policy-driven one, so only major policies can save it,\u201d he told the New York Times. Another angry investor \u2013 who claimed to have lost most of his savings \u2013 posted a complaint that quickly went viral: \u201cThis was a stock wipeout that thoroughly damaged middle-classed assets from a decade of striving,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor us the \u2018Chinese dream\u2019 is just a dream.\u201d This was a particularly pointed attack on Xi\u2019s own roseate notion of the \u201cChinese dream\u201d \u2013 which the president has relied upon to inspire his people forward on what he calls \u201cthe road to rejuvenation\u201d, and to galvanise their nationalism against the various \u201chostile foreign forces\u201d (jingwai didui shili) that he regards as a threat to China\u2019s continuing rise.     Deng Xiaoping in 1986. Photograph: Reuters/Corbis    Even China\u2019s feared Public Security Bureau was summoned to meet the challenge of the plunging stock markets. Its charge was to investigate, and possibly arrest, what the New China News Agency called \u201cmalicious\u201d short sellers (which in China is not an illegal practice) \u2013 a group of malefactors said by some Chinese media outlets to include the American financier George Soros. The extent of the party\u2019s belated panic may have been best captured by the absurd instruction given by party propaganda officials to students at Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, who were told to loudly chant, at the start of their graduation ceremony, \u201cRevive the A-shares! Benefit the people!\u201d (After news of this effort went viral, the chant was changed at the last minute to something more anodyne.) In 1989, four days after the massacre of protesters at Tiananmen Square, a gloomy Deng Xiaoping told his military commanders, \u201cThere was this storm that was bound to happen sooner or later.\u201d He was doubtless referring to the way he had opened up Chinese society over the preceding decade to many democratic ideas, which helped precipitate the monumental demonstrations in Beijing that spring. Were Deng still alive to watch the Chinese stock exchanges that he himself had initiated crash some 25 years later, he might have said the same thing. For the rise, and fall, of these markets was a delayed but equally inevitable outcome of another one of his very unlikely and risky experiments. Upon returning to power in 1978 after Mao\u2019s death, Deng feared that China would fall further behind the rest of the world if it did not quickly initiate radical reforms. Proclaiming a bold new programme of \u201creform and opening up\u201d (gaige kaifang), he called on the Chinese to begin borrowing from other economic and political systems. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t fear to adopt the advanced management methods applied in capitalist countries,\u201d he said. It was a shocking exhortation from a communist leader who had spent his entire life steeped in Maoist revolution and class struggle. But it was only the first of a string of surprising public utterances and policies during these early pioneering years in the 1980s. Part of Deng\u2019s broad regimen of reform involved testing the transplantation of indelibly capitalist ideas and institutions into the host body of China\u2019s hitherto completely Marxist-Leninist system. One of his boldest experiments began in the late 1980s, when, like a mad scientist playing with the creation of new hybrid species, he called for the creation of two capitalist-style stock exchanges in China. The first was to be established in Shanghai, a city that had been the wellspring of the most virulently leftist form of violent Maoist class struggle during the Cultural Revolution. The second was to be set up in Shenzhen, then a brand new city-in-the-making that was itself another one of Deng\u2019s bold experiments. It involved the creation of four new coastal special economic zones, intended to promote Chinese development by allowing more unfettered interaction with the outside world.     Shanghai Stock Exchange. Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP    Observers at the time \u2013 including myself, then covering these counterintuitive changes in China for the New Yorker \u2013 were left scratching our heads in puzzlement. How were these capitalist organs ever going to be transplanted into the living body of Chinese socialism, much less take root and thrive? Deng, who quaintly dubbed all these experiments \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d (zhongguo you teside shehui zhuyi), seemed unfazed by all the contradictions inherent in these plans. But, as someone who had first come to China during the Cultural Revolution, I found it difficult not to be sceptical about such projects succeeding \u2013 given the clash between what then appeared to be two wildly irreconcilable ideological positions. When the Shanghai exchange opened its first proper trading floor just across the Garden Bridge in what, before 1949, had been the grand old colonial Astor Hotel, it was a mind-bending experience to gaze out over the traders\u2019 desks to the electronic index boards (some of the first I had seen in China!) where the share prices of the few score listed companies were displayed. It was hard not to wonder how Chairman Mao\u2019s vaunted Chinese communist revolution had ever come to this. How had such a reviled capitalist institution fallen into such an apostate land? However, as Deng\u2019s new amalgam economy began to gather momentum, private businesses did begin to proliferate and the economy did begin to take off. Soon, the sceptics were left to wonder whether Deng might not have stumbled on a new hybrid economic model after all \u2013 one that was not only workable, but very dynamic. If so, he had done a masterful end-run around all the old verities of our own western economic development theory, systems and experience. But as bold, inventive and successful as Deng Xiaoping\u2019s new economy came to seem over the ensuing years, the implanting of such market-oriented entities as stock exchanges into what was still largely an unreconstructed one-party, centrally planned state economy created a situation that seemed destined \u2013 as Deng had lamented in 1989 \u2013 to trigger a storm sooner or later. In the world of economics, there are few institutions more dependent than stock exchanges on an ability to respond in an unfettered way to market forces. After all, in the world of politics, however, there are few systems more dedicated to maintaining central control and empowering state intervention than that of the People\u2019s Republic of China. In short, it seemed highly unlikely these opposite tendencies could coexist in happy synergy for ever: what we have seen playing out in China over the past few weeks, then, was a kind of delayed autoimmune reaction to having such an alien presence transplanted within it. The host might survive, but the organ was going to have to adapt to be accepted. * * * By the end of last week, Chinese markets had started to respond to the government\u2019s many interventions, and a slight rebound began. But although they were still up 82% over a year ago, they had fallen 28% from their high in June \u2013 and this week, they began dipping once again. Furthermore, some half of all listed companies \u2013 representing 40% of the market\u2019s total value \u2013 had suspended trading, creating a gross market distortion, augmented by the fact most \u201cbuyers\u201d in the market were now government-funded surrogates ordered to do so, not value-conscious investors. It is hard to imagine that all this behind-the-scenes manipulation will not dent the confidence of investors in the future: the already tenuous connection between share prices and actual corporate value will now be even more uncertain, when the government, in effect, has its thumb on the scales. Added to that fear is the real possibility that shareholders who re-enter the market may find themselves in the future holding untradable and therefore illiquid shares if the government again decides to freeze market operations in response to a sharp decline. Almost immediately after the crash, the overseas investors who had bought into Chinese companies through the Hong Kong exchange began pulling their capital out of Chinese stocks \u2013 the most prolonged period of net outflow since the programme of trading via Hong Kong began last November. So it is still far too early to speak of China\u2019s stock markets as having \u201cstablised\u201d or \u201creturned to normalcy\u201d. (To begin with, many company shares are still not trading.) By making the risky choice to move in and prop up share prices as they fell, party leaders effectively took ownership of markets whose proper functioning requires them to remain independent. Evidently, they felt that their credibility as China\u2019s grand air-traffic controllers was being put at risk \u2013 that they would lose credibility, respect and even face if they did not confront the plunging market head on and at least give the appearance of being in control. Here it must be said that, because China is a closed society and the negotiations among its leadership are so opaque, we on the outside rarely know who really makes decisions about important issues \u2013 or by what process they are made; all we can see are the results that follow. So when we speak of the wishes of \u201cparty leaders\u201d, or even of \u201cPresident Xi\u201d, we are referring to a world that we can only see through a glass darkly.    The party felt its credibility as China\u2019s grand air-traffic controller was at risk \u2013 that it would lose credibility    But in this case, the consequences of the decision are clear. By acting so intrusively, party leaders have left themselves subject to what Colin Powell memorably called the \u201cPottery Barn rule\u201d \u2013 if you break it, you own it. Suddenly, China\u2019s stock exchanges have become wards of the Chinese Communist party \u2013 and their fate hardly bodes well for Xi\u2019s declaration that the nation\u2019s economic salvation will lie in allowing market forces to play a greater role in the allocation of resources. There is an ancient Chinese aphorism: \u201cSleeping in the same bed, but dreaming different dreams\u201d (Tongchuang yimeng). By initiating so many innovative reforms back in the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping not only created some strange bedfellows, but bequeathed a complex legacy of interbred institutions to later generations. By introducing so many conflicting ideas and institutions from different systems into the heart of what was still the Chinese communist revolution, Deng Xiaoping became the progenitor of what ended up being a virtual counter-revolution against Maoism. And while his \u201creform and opening up\u201d did infuse his country with significant new dynamism, it also put a series of troublesome institutional and ideological contradictions at the centre of China\u2019s whole post-Mao landscape. Stock markets were only one of the most obvious and graphic examples of these contradictions. When the stock bubble \u2013 which had so inflated the listed value of shares that a natural correction was inevitable \u2013 finally burst, China did appear to be undergoing a kind of organ failure. In the view of Beijing\u2019s attending neo-Maoist physicians, this failure called for emergency life support. Ever worried about any perturbation in the field that might undermine social stability, China\u2019s \u201csocialist\u201d apparat did what it knows how to do best when alarmed. Instead of standing by and waiting while Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d restabilised the markets \u2013 albeit at a considerably lower valuation \u2013 Xi and his leadership sprung into action. Having evidently decided that this precipitous correction was a dire threat not just to China\u2019s economic health, but also to social and political stability, they sought to levitate share prices back up again through whatever forms of state intervention and manipulation they could muster.     A Chinese worker walks past a billboard along a construction site in Shanghai. Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images    The party might have been excused if it had simply eschewed responsibility for what was happening. After all, markets have a logic of their own that makes them both rise and fall according to their own forces. But, instead of simply saying, \u201cNot our problem\u201d, it launched a massive socialist-style rescue campaign, thereby making the party responsible for everything that happened thereafter. Why did the party allow itself to become stuck in this quicksand? Leaders evidently felt themselves threatened not only by the collapsing share prices, but by what they also feared would be perceived as an erosion of their own credibility. What they seem to have concluded was at stake was their ability to continue projecting an image of omnipotence \u2013 the appearance, at least, of being strong enough to continue guiding and controlling \u201call under heaven\u201d (tianxia). This is an ancient notion, dating back to imperial times, when an emperor\u2019s reign was believed to be legitimised by a so-called \u201cmandate of heaven,\u201d (tianming), that conferred the right on a sovereign to rule. Any untoward sign of heaven\u2019s disfavour, it was believed, would be manifested through such things as earthquakes, rebellions, droughts or other disturbances in the usual order of things. And since such events were invariably viewed as ominous end-of-dynasty symbols, emperors were always strongly allergic to them. Of course, emperors of old never had to wrangle modern stock markets. But today, a good market crash fits right into these ancient \u2013 and still deeply embedded \u2013 ideas in the popular mind. Indeed, in the modern context, it is not hard to see how a crashed financial market might be viewed as a powerful suggestion that party leaders are losing heaven\u2019s favour and their own legitimacy, and, worse, that a new dynastic cycle may be in the offing. And, of course, the last people the party wished to alienate were members of its burgeoning middle class, whose quiescence has long depended on the economy moving onward and upward without major interruption. Since such residual traditional logic remains deep in the bloodstream of the Chinese people, it most certainly played a role in goading party leaders into attempting to bring these two insubordinate \u201ccapitalist\u201d markets to heel as quickly as possible to provide proof that they still held the right to rule. Of course, when such modern markets are rising, they ipso facto help prove that \u201cthe mandate\u201d is still conferring legitimacy on China\u2019s rulers, and so can be left unattended. But when they begin to founder, the ensuing dysfunction creates the suggestion that the mandate is weakening. Such a threat begs urgent intervention. * * * The obvious contradiction between a largely self-regulating financial market and a highly controlled and centralised economy is a graphic representation of China\u2019s divided modern-day self. What characterises China today is that it is in the middle of a process of uncertain change in many ways. Its once purely socialist command economy is now partially socialist and partially capitalist, and it is this collision that helped trigger the drama of clashing systems and values we have been watching play out over the past few weeks. President Xi, like his predecessor Hu Jintao, speaks often about the Confucian virtues of harmony (hexie) and stability (wending). Perhaps this is because every time he and the six other members of the ruling politburo standing committee turn around, they run into disaccord and instability. And many of the problems they now confront grow out of the fact that, for the past century, China has been in the process of tectonic self-reinvention, seeking to recreate not only a new political system, economic structure and value system, but a whole new national identity. This long, painful, and complicated process began with the collapse of China\u2019s ancient imperial system and its sustaining Confucian ideology in 1912. Thereafter, China was left with the daunting task of filling the remaining vacuum \u2013 of recreating itself from the ground up. In serial fashion it experimented with Sun Yat-sen\u2019s Republicanism, Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s east-west syncretism, Mao Zedong\u2019s sinified communism, Deng Xiaoping\u2019s hybrid capitalist-socialism, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao\u2019s consensus authoritarianism; and now \u2026 now what? What will the essence of Xi Jinping\u2019s reinvented China be? What exactly is his vision of financial markets in a vibrant new economy? One that does the party\u2019s bidding or one that responds independently to market signals and market value, as other global capital markets do? And what is his larger vision for China\u2019s economy, political system, rule of law, civil society, and system of core values? What, in effect, is his model? Although we can see a few shadowy outlines of answers emerging as China\u2019s reform odyssey continues, we still do not really know exactly where Xi intends to take the nation. To look into his \u201cChinese dream\u201d is to see an aspiration for a country that is wealthier, more powerful and better respected. If you look at Xi\u2019s domestic policies it is possible to see an ominously Mao-tinged autocrat whose answer to most problems seems to be more discipline, controls and toughness. But there is little else. And so, because China will almost certainly remain caught between transitions for some time to come, the resolution of crises such as stock market crashes will remain an uncertain and parlous business. The Maoist toolbox into which Xi now seems to reach with increasing frequency when problems occur provides him with few suitable tools for handling many of the complexities of 21st-century economic markets. China\u2019s future remains unclear, because so much of its agenda is still a work in progress. To have a capitalist stock market being played like a casino by tens of millions of freebooting speculators right in the middle of a society still purporting to be socialist and run by a communist party with a deep affinity for rigid, Leninist, interventionist controls speaks to the contradictory nature of the modern Chinese dilemma. It is a living embodiment of what Mao Zedong liked to refer to as an \u201cantagonistic contradiction\u201d (diwo maodun) \u2013 an inconsistency that can only be resolved through struggle, even violence. Alas, such an unenviable predicament is hardly limited to China\u2019s stock markets. In certain telling ways the response of the nation\u2019s leaders to the recent market crash is emblematic of a much larger dilemma \u2013 one that sits right at the heart of China\u2019s uneasy fusion of communism and free-market economics, a system with little precedent and no operating manual. In the years to come, with many opposing principles and forces in an unresolved state of contention, it is unlikely, as China\u2019s great experiment in self-recreation goes forward, that its hallmarks will be \u201charmony\u201d and \u201cstability\u201d. \u2022 Follow the Guardian long read on Twitter: @gdnlongread", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Stock markets", "World news", "Business", "Chinese economy"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-16T05:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/china-sex-viral-video-uniqlo", "sentences": ["Of course, not everyone approves of these new found freedoms \u2013 according to a 2015 survey carried out by Shanghai Normal University, 40% of 14- to 35-year-olds are uncomfortable with the idea of premarital sex."], "title": "China\u2019s young people have spoken. And what they want is sex | Jemimah Steinfeld", "article": "When Ang Lee\u2019s film Lust, Caution came out in China in 2007, seven minutes of its infamous sex scenes were cut. The reason? They violated China\u2019s obscenity laws. The Chinese population were not content. In response, they downloaded the original from pirate sites, to such an extent that headlines warned of computer viruses embedded in many of the sites that offered the film. Those living in southern China even crossed the border into Hong Kong to see the full-fat version. The people had spoken, and what they wanted was sex. Flash forward to 2015 and, as I learned while researching my book Little Emperors and Material Girls: Sex and Youth in Modern China, something similar is happening. A viral video, which emerged on Chinese social media on Tuesday evening, has raced across the internet and set pulses racing. The one-minute clip shows a young man and woman having sex in the changing rooms of Uniqlo in Beijing\u2019s shopping and nightlife hub Sanlitun. It\u2019s already been viewed by millions.   Related: Why have young people in Japan stopped having sex?    The government\u2019s online watchdog issued a statement registering its displeasure regarding the video\u2019s content. It has also reprimanded China\u2019s top internet firms for allowing the pornographic film to air, and censors are currently working overtime to remove any trace of it. Good luck to them. As both the film and the video show, the government is not only out of sync with its own population, it\u2019s not necessarily in control of it either. A sexual revolution has taken place in China over the past few decades which shows no signs of cooling down. The strict ethical codes created under Confucius and continued under Chairman Mao are melting away in China\u2019s bars and bedrooms. Rates of premarital sex attest to this. The latest official statistics, from 2012, say 70% engage in premarital sex, and if anything this figure has probably risen in the years since. Of course, not everyone approves of these new found freedoms \u2013 according to a 2015 survey carried out by Shanghai Normal University, 40% of 14- to 35-year-olds are uncomfortable with the idea of premarital sex. That still leaves a sizeable majority who are fine with it, showing that attitudes and actions are roughly in tune. In Sanlitun, where the offending Uniqlo is situated, a typical night out looks like this: head to a bar, start drinking, move on to karaoke or a club, continue drinking, stop at a street stall for some chuanr (kebab) or jianbing (pancake), finally stumble home, sometimes with someone. The youth of China are no longer a shy bunch. They\u2019re increasingly hedonistic and up for a good time. This is at the more personal end. Then there\u2019s what the government really don\u2019t want you to see. Staying in Sanlitun, rows of sex stores line the street, enticing passersby with neon signs and latex displays. Alongside hair salons and massage parlours, they feature doe-eyed girls staring out at customers longingly, offering services that aren\u2019t on the main menu. Drug dealers are also nearby, and trade is good. According to the National narcotics control commission, the domestic drug industry is worth a whopping $82bn annually. Three quarters of those who take drugs are under 35. And yet the government pretends none of this exists.    China will struggle to close Pandora\u2019s box. As the expression goes, where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way    China will struggle to close Pandora\u2019s box. As the expression goes, where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. Sex shops and brothels that close tend to reopen or move underground, as has happened in Dongguan, China\u2019s sin city. Officials can be paid to turn a blind eye \u2013 and plenty partake in these pleasures themselves. Earlier in May three Chinese officials were sacked over a sex tape blackmail case. Then, as Lust, Caution highlights, censorship is not foolproof. In China it\u2019s a well-oiled machine, but there are loopholes. Whether using carefully crafted memes, wordplay or going through virtual private networks, China\u2019s 642 million internet users can and do find a lot of what they want. If anything, China\u2019s internet is driving the sexual revolution. Take the example of Muzi Mei, who created a sex blog in 2003. Mei\u2019s warts-and-all account of her sex life was an instant hit, knocking Chairman Mao off the top search term list at one point. By the time it was shut down, scores of similar sites had emerged.

The group had been scheduled to perform in Beijing and Shanghai in September as part of an Asian tour but those shows were scrapped earlier this week. No official explanation has been given with a statement from Live Nation, the band\u2019s promoter, alluding only to an unspecified \u201creason\u201d. The cancellations sparked speculation that a tweet sent by Jesse Carmichael, the group\u2019s keyboard player, was responsible.  In the message, posted on July 4, Carmichael sent birthday wishes to the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The musician reportedly attended a party celebrating the Buddhist leader\u2019s 80th birthday in the United States. The tweet, since deleted, linked to a photograph on Instagram that was also later removed. This week, the Beijing edition of Time Out reported: \u201cWe hear musings about Maroon 5 being prevented from performing by our political friends up above.\u201d Meeting the Dalai Lama \u201cis all an artist needs to get a big X on their visa application,\u201d the magazine added. The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile since 1959 and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, is revered around the world. But China\u2019s Communist party leaders accuse him of being an independence-seeking \u201csplittist\u201d and a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d. Beijing has punished politicians, including David Cameron, who have met with the Tibetan Nobel laureate by imposing lengthy diplomatic freezes. As word of the Maroon 5 cancellations spread, Chinese social media sites filled with comments \u2013 some apparently posted by state-sponsored internet stooges \u2013 attacking the band. One user of Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, wrote: \u201cThey\u2019ve nobody to blame but themselves. Anyone who supports Tibetan separatists deserves to be blacklisted. He has dragged his whole band down.\u201d Another commented: \u201cIt is better they never set foot in China. Foreigners have no right to meddle our own internal affairs.\u201d \u201cOf course we can\u2019t let him in to make money out of our country. It concerns the basic dignity of a country,\u201d added a third. Chinese authorities have made no official pronouncement about the band\u2019s aborted trip but Maroon 5 would not be the first musicians to fall foul of Beijing\u2019s sensitivities over Tibet. Icelandic singer Bjork incurred the government\u2019s wrath after calling for Tibet\u2019s independence during a 2008 show in Shanghai. Oasis were forced to cancel shows in China the following year, supposedly because front-man Noel Gallagher had performed at a Free Tibet concert in New York. Sir Elton John was reportedly interviewed by Chinese police after dedicating a 2012 concert in Beijing \u201cto the spirit and talent of Ai Weiwei\u201d, the dissident artist. An intensifying political crackdown being waged by president Xi Jinping has already been blamed for the cancellation of a series of events and concerts in Beijing this year.

It should have been about whether he is really making the best use of his talents or whether, at 29, he would be better off in Europe chasing medals rather than cash. As it turned out, last week was about another scandal. Gyan is a man, it seems, perpetually wedded to controversy. The latest furore erupted after a 22-year-old student revealed she had had an affair with Gyan. He does not deny it but what he does deny is her claim that she is pregnant with his child and that he \u201cforcibly sodomised\u201d her in her bathroom, something she claims to have on video, although she has said now is not the right time to release the tape.   Related: Asamoah Gyan denies murdering rapper in alleged human sacrifice    There have been suggestions police tried unsuccessfully to confiscate the student\u2019s phone to see if the video is there. According to reports, she first attracted Gyan\u2019s attention by sending him a suggestive video of herself. This latest controversy came a year to the week after the disappearance of Gyan\u2019s friend, the rapper Castro (real name, Theophilus Tagoe) and their mutual friend Janet Bandu. They were last seen riding jet-skis in the Atlantic in the coastal resort of Ada. No bodies have been recovered and both families have insisted they believe the pair to be alive. Police have said they have expanded their search for them to other West African countries, the implication being that, for reasons that remain opaque, they are in hiding. By September the innuendo linking Gyan to the disappearance had become so strong that he felt compelled to release a statement denying it (which, unfortunately, only served to alert the world\u2019s media to the story allowing it happily to report the lurid allegations Gyan was repudiating). \u201cWhat sells in the media,\u201d Gyan\u2019s statement read, \u201cand what indeed is sold and is still selling in the media in Ghana are wild allegations and rumours directed especially at Asamoah Gyan, ranging from the absurd \u2013 of the imputation of criminality to him in the sense that he either murdered Castro or had him kidnapped \u2013 and ending with the ludicrous \u2013 that he sacrificed him spiritually to enhance his career.\u201d Maybe it is no more complicated than that: that Gyan is a star suffering the worst attentions of a certain section of the Ghanaian media. His relationship with certain journalists has always been uneasy. During the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, which Ghana hosted, for instance, he was criticised so severely after missing a couple of easy chances that he tried to walk out on the squad, only to be persuaded to stay by his brother, Baffour, and Michael Essien. Last year there were allegations that Baffour had beaten up a hostile journalist, although after an arrest charges were subsequently dropped. Whatever the reason for the constant background of scandals, they tend to occlude the most interesting aspect of Gyan\u2019s career, which is that, for all his talent, he has chosen to play in Abu Dhabi and China. He was 25, had helped Ghana to a World Cup quarter-final and was, in patches \u2013 the 3-0 win at Chelsea perhaps most notably \u2013 looking as though he might develop into a genuine star at Sunderland when, in 2011, he abruptly departed for Al Ain. He quadrupled his salary and Sunderland just about got their money back (although given they\u2019d just sold Darren Bent, the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse and precipitated the New Year collapse of 2010-11), but it was hard not to wonder then whether, in the long run, he might not have been better staying in Europe, developing further as a player and increasing his pay that way. Then again, given the cultural pressure to provide for an extended family, maybe it was only natural to take the money when it was offered. As it was, Gyan scored 73 goals in 63 games for Al Ain and his value remained high. Financially, it\u2019s hard to believe he could have done any better elsewhere. Nor has there been any obvious downturn in his form for the national side. But still, it is difficult not to wonder just how good he might have been had he pushed on at a higher level, and whether his legacy might not have been key goals in the Champions League rather than a slew of sordid gossip.", "tags": ["Football", "Sunderland", "Ghana", "Africa Cup of Nations", "Sport", "China"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-17T11:00:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/17/outkast-stone-mountain-bankrupt-50-cent-t-park-ariana-grande-week-in-music", "sentences": ["A tweet may have scuppered Maroon 5\u2019s China tour plans So much for the band\u2019s scheduled Beijing and Shanghai concerts in September."], "title": "The week in music: Outkast for Stone Mountain, bankrupt 50 Cent and more", "article": "Get Outkast carved on to Stone Mountain, demand fans If the signatories of a recent petition end up having their way, Atlanta natives Big Boi and Andr\u00e9 3000 will be immortalised in stone, riding in a Cadillac alongside the Confederate leaders Stonewall Jackson, Robert E Lee and Jefferson Davis.

He\u2019d narrated a sex tape that she\u2019d made with her partner and it was distributed online without her consent.  Leviston isn\u2019t an ex-lover of 50\u2019s, but she has a child with rapper Rick Ross, with whom 50 has been feuding for years. Apparently a great way for 50 to hit out at Ross involved making sexually explicit remarks about Leviston, in character as \u201cPimpin\u2019 Curly\u201d, and generally exhibiting nasty behaviour towards a woman. \u2026 Before he suddenly filed for bankruptcy Three days later, 50 Cent filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The latter looks to have taken India\u2019s No 1 spot this week, with an impressive 102.6 crore ($16.1m) domestic take and at least $2.5m in overseas readies that would put it just inside the global top 10.

That makes it the most successful Telugu film of all time by a long way, the fastest Indian film over 300 crore, and on current standing, the ninth highest grossing Indian film of all time. The film\u2019s technical prowess, dramatic dynamism and financial heft (the Hindi-language version alone has taken over 50 crore) are prompting some soul-searching within Bollywood \u2013 too heavily in hock to its bloated star system, according to some.   Related: Bajrangi Bhaijaan review: Salman Khan strong even when wet as he escorts mute six-year-old back to Pakistan    The winner Evil \u2013 the yellow, burbling sort \u2013 edged out the superhero delegation this week, as Minions held on to the top spot despite the incursion of Marvel\u2019s Ant-Man. No particular surprise, with the Universal film on release in nearly 20 more territories.      Holding on ... Minions Photograph: Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES    The only new observation to make is that, with a steep 57% drop from last week\u2019s $115.7m (\u00a374m) US opening, the mindless Minions torrent may not quite have the same staying power as the more homily-rooted Despicable Me (-42% second week drop) or Despicable Me 2 (-47%). If that plummet continues, the latter\u2019s $368.1m US gross (which made it No 4 film in 2013) will be tough to match, and Minions will be left leaning on its (hitherto powerhouse) international performance to make up the slack. A month in, it\u2019s already on $625.8m, with another eight territories and a possible Chinese release to come. So $1bn overall is still on the cards. Minor Marvel Ant-Man\u2019s going to do OK for its size. The diminutive hero chosen by Marvel to close business on its second phase has been given a scaled-down budget: $130m, against Captain America: The First Avenger\u2019s $140m, Thor\u2019s $150m and Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s $170m, to compare it to the studio\u2019s other first-instalment offerings.    Related: Paul Rudd on Ant-Man, being Hollywood\u2019s go-to nice guy and growing up with English parents in Kansas    Just as well, because Ant-Man\u2019s $58m US opening \u2013 good, but still the lowest for an in-house Marvel offering \u2013 suggests Peyton Reed\u2019s serviceable, intermittently inspired romp will not have the same level of impact as the rest of the stable. But this was probably a project with innate limitations: Ant-Man is a relatively obscure part of the Marvel canon, and lead actor Paul Rudd supplied only modest star traction ($19.2m for Role Models and $17.8m for I Love You, Man are his two previous best openings where he was a key part of the package).            Ant-Man - video review    The good news \u2013 for the strength of the overall Marvel brand as much as anything else \u2013 is that Ant-Man is going toe-to-toe with other superhero new boys overseas. Taking this week\u2019s top five markets \u2013 the UK ($6m), Mexico ($5.6m), Russia ($4.9m), France ($4m) and Australia ($4m) \u2013 as comparison points, Ant-Man is outpacing the first Captain America, level with Iron Man, slightly under Thor, well under Guardians of the Galaxy.  Interestingly, the one region where it\u2019s setting records next to the above is south-east Asia; possibly Marvel\u2019s heritage, and its superhero pecking order, are less relevant here. So, overall, no danger of Ant-Man\u2019s box office going sub-atomic. Marvel\u2019s Phase Three, which begins with 2016\u2019s Doctor Strange, could be where the pressure is on: lots of unfamiliar faces to introduce to audiences, and more concerted competition as Warner Bros and DC finally get their act together with their own cinematic universe. Monster Chinese weekend            Like February\u2019s news that the monthly Chinese total had beaten the US one for the first time, this felt like another one of those weeks where the eastern box-office tide lapped another few centimetres further up the strand. Two local films \u2013 CGI/live-action hybrid Monster Hunt ($72m) and superhero spoof Jian Bing Man ($61m) \u2013 each grossed more than the No 1 US film Ant-Man, and helped set a slew of records on the way. Counted across four days since its Thursday release, Monster Hunt \u2013 Shrek the Third co-director Raman Hui\u2019s tale of a civil war in the monster kingdom \u2013 took $109m, beating road comedy Breakup Buddies\u2019 domestic-film opening record from last year; it also set new highs for biggest opening day ($26.4m) and biggest single day ($29.8m).  Saturday saw the biggest-ever 24 hours at the Chinese box office ($68.3m), as part of its biggest-ever weekend ($185m), during its biggest-ever week ($282m). Jian Bing Man \u2013 which translates as Pancake Man, one of the gallery of goons in this meta-tinged superhero lampooning \u2013 is also in line to claim college drama So Young\u2019s benchmark $118m gross for the most successful film for a first-time director. The Chinese Norris McWhirter presumably can\u2019t keep up.            It comes as a huge boon for Chinese cinema: a sincere vote of confidence from local audiences who, during the late June/July blackout period for Hollywood films designed to artificially boost Chinese market share, have little choice but to gravitate back towards the homemade. But not with wild enthusiasm in the last few weeks. The successes of the last fortnight, performing-school drama Forever Young and Shanghai romancer Tiny Times 4.0, were run-of-the-mill entries from the school of contemporary twentysomething fodder that has dominated in recent years. But Monster Hunt \u2013 a pricey $35m affair from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon producer Bill Kong that is one of the country\u2019s first CGI/live action combos \u2013 and Jian Bing Man \u2013 which lets online comedy-sketch sensation Da Peng loose on the superhero trend and ropes in a Jean-Claude van Damme cameo \u2013 seem even more commercially aggressive. They\u2019re direct hacks of Hollywood forms that feel far more culturally attuned than the fusty period dramas and lavish but sometimes cloying martial-arts fantasias that have made up so much recent Chinese popular cinema.

It would seem to have everything: miles of coastline with beaches open to all, the striking Santa Monica mountains just to the north, plenty of equally striking southern-Californian architecture (its many celebrity residents include the illustrious architect Frank Gehry), top-rated schools, police and firefighters, and, of course, that world-famous pier.  It has also avoided some of the problems that plague Los Angeles, from the financial (its general fund reserve exceeds that of LA, which has over 40 times Santa Monica\u2019s population) to the cultural (that population itself \u2013 among which you more often hear British accents than the babel of tongues that characterise the big city just east \u2013 appears to get along without much visible conflict). Given this sun, sea, stability and prosperity, one would imagine that one\u2019s wellbeing would take care of itself.  However, starting in 2013, the city of Santa Monica began developing a means by which to gauge, both objectively and subjectively, whether its citizens really do enjoy such a famously high quality of life. The Wellbeing Project, funded by a million-dollar grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 first Mayors Challenge, a competition meant to spur city leaders to come up with, in the words of founder and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, \u201cinnovative new ways to address urban challenges \u2013 and then share what\u2019s working with the world\u201d. The same year the Mayors Challenge awarded a grant to Santa Monica for the Wellbeing Project, it also awarded grants to four other American cities \u2013 Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, and Providence \u2013 to fund their own ideas. As the smallest in that cohort by a wide margin, Santa Monica looked like an outlier from the beginning, but its modest size also made its proposal more viable, given its stated ambition of not just breaking down overall quality of life into a set of measurable factors, but actually going out and measuring them in its population of 93,000. Santa Monica\u2019s impressive branding of the Wellbeing Project, an effort with serious resources behind it, begins with the word \u201cwellbeing\u201d itself \u2013 who, anywhere, could argue they don\u2019t want more of it? But its wide range of meanings is also something of a liability, as the Wellbeing Project has faced the challenge defining it both as precisely and as unobjectionably as possible. The resulting Wellbeing Index measures Santa Monicans\u2019 quality of life across six broad categories: outlook, community, place, learning, health and opportunity.    If Santa Monica can\u2019t be an exemplary model then what hope is there for Jakarta or Johannesburg \u2026  Rick Cole        The Wellbeing Index measures Santa Monicans\u2019 quality of life across six broad categories: outlook, community, place, learning, health, and opportunity. Photograph: P Eoche/Getty    Undergirding these feel-good words with suitably rigorous methods of data collection \u2013 as well as determining what data to collect in the first place \u2013 called for a series of high-profile partnerships. The City of Santa Monica enlisted as its research partner the Rand Corporation, a policy thinktank known for its sternly cerebral image and history of work with the US military (and conveniently located in an office across the street from Santa Monica\u2019s city hall). Rand, in turn, partnered with the New Economics Foundation, another thinktank, based in London, with experience in the emerging field of happiness research and its integration with traditional forms of economic assessment. This alliance assembled the Wellbeing Index by gathering information on three fronts: conducting a survey of 2,200 adult Santa Monica residents in autumn of 2014; assembling relevant administrative data already held by the City of Santa Monica (from, for example, the police department, the bus system, or the libraries) and other entities (such as the American Community Survey and the California Health Interview Survey), and tracking the opinions (or, in the Wellbeing Project\u2019s terminology, \u201csentiment data\u201d) of Santa Monicans aired directly on social media services such as Twitter and Foursquare. The Wellbeing Project released its first report, Creating a city for wellbeing, in April, which offered a host of encouraging, if unsurprising, findings \u2013 \u201cResidents are generally satisfied with life and most have time to do things they enjoy\u201d ... \u201cengaging in more frequent social interactions and spending time outdoors are highly correlated with higher personal wellbeing\u201d \u2013 as well as such mild causes for concern as \u201cmiddle-age groups report greater stress and difficulties with work-life balance\u201d. But one category of finding has taken many involved with the Wellbeing Project by surprise: Santa Monicans \u201creported high levels of trust in the neighbourhoods in which they live, but still not enough day-to-day connection with neighbourhoods\u201d. Indeed, few \u201cfelt they could actually count on the people in the neighborhood\u201d if it came down to it, relative to the responses given in similar surveys nationwide. The research also discovered that, \u201cwhile many residents were engaged in volunteering and voted in general elections, relatively few felt they had influence in affecting decisions in Santa Monica\u201d. Their \u201chigh number of neutral positions on these questions\u201d suggested \u201ca certain level of apathy with regard to these issues\u201d \u2013 a troubling revelation, surely, for a city that prides itself on its reputation for high civic engagement. Ana Jara, a Santa Monica-born community leader, worked on Cradle to Career, a data-driven project focused on youth wellbeing, which could be considered the Wellbeing Project\u2019s predecessor. She recalls her surprise upon first reading of the Wellbeing Index\u2019s reflection of this widespread sense of civic disengagement \u2013 especially among the young and more recent arrivals to the city \u2013 so starkly did it contrast with her own personal experience of Santa Monica as place of classically tight-knit small-town social fabric.      Santa Monica has largely remained a city where \u2018each person is stuck in a car\u2019. Photograph: George Rose/Getty    To explain this fragmentation, Jara points first to the way Santa Monica has, on the whole, remained a city \u201cwhere we\u2019re each stuck in a car\u201d; one where, according to the Wellbeing Project\u2019s data, most residents (44% of whom don\u2019t live within five minutes\u2019 walk of either goods or services) drive alone to work. Despite Los Angeles County\u2019s ambitious construction of urban rail over the past 25 years, much of Santa Monica \u2013 whose first and only planned link to the system won\u2019t enter service until next year \u2013 has held to the stolid suburban car dependence of the region\u2019s affluent west side. (It lends a certain irony to the Wellbeing Project\u2019s Mayors Challenge entry video, set entirely on city buses.) The city also suffers from a long-standing aversion to high-density development, which contributes to the problem Jara laments even more emphatically: housing. Approximately one-fifth of the Wellbeing Project\u2019s survey respondents expressed worries about paying their rent or mortgage, but they, by definition, are the lucky ones, those who manage to live in Santa Monica at all. Many, no matter how rooted in the community, have had to move outside the ever-more-expensive low-rise city\u2019s boundaries and work on \u201ctrying to find a way back in\u201d \u2014 including no less a dyed-in-the-wool Santa Monican than Jara herself. Jason Islas, editor of Santa Monica Next, a news site oriented toward the city\u2019s future and with a younger demographic than the Santa Monica median age (40.2, according to the Wellbeing Project), points to a variety of factors that make life unnecessarily difficult for that generation of residents. The list begins with a forbidding political culture characterised by deeply acrimonious five-hour city council meetings and culminates in the persistent \u201curbanophobia\u201d that has kept the city\u2019s housing stock artificially low, scarce and expensive. \u201cAs someone who grew up in Santa Monica, I would say the single hardest thing is the cost of living,\u201d says Islas. \u201cYes, Santa Monica is one of the more desirable places to live, so rents are always going to be higher than other places in the county, but if you have a political culture that\u2019s resistant to building housing, you\u2019re adding to the pile of affordability issues. Here, you spend most of your twenties trying to keep your head above water; you don\u2019t have time to start a family. That affects our wellbeing. If you\u2019re spending 50%-60% of your pay on rent, you don\u2019t have money to go to concerts with your friends, to go out and eat \u2013 the things that help us socialise and make connections in our community.\u201d     As someone who grew up in Santa Monica, I would say the single hardest thing is the cost of living  Jason Islas        \u2018Santa Monica is one of the more desirable places to live, so rents are always going to be higher than other places in the county.\u2019 Photograph: Jon Hicks/Corbis    Islas cites such Wellbeing Project statistics as the 53% of Santa Monicans who report concern over their children\u2019s prospects of affording life in the city. But how to bring this information to bear on these issues? The short history between happiness measurement and governance offers few encouraging examples. Early materials from the Wellbeing Project looked to Bhutan, the poor Himalayan kingdom that famously declared its commitment not to gross domestic product (GDP) but \u201cgross national happiness\u201d \u2013 which critics such as the Financial Times\u2019 Alan Beattie call \u201ca deeply illiberal means of legitimising undemocratic rule [that] has distracted from much more constructive and democratic ideas of running countries in the interests of their citizens\u2019 wider wellbeing\u201d. Though it may boast an actively left-leaning city government, the People\u2019s Republic of Santa Monica \u2013 as both its loudest critics and fans call it \u2013 hardly counts as similarly autocratic. More than a world away from the subsistence farmers of Bhutan, the Wellbeing Project\u2019s report recognises (albeit in passively bureaucratic language) where its own challenge lies: \u201cWhile there has been increasing national, state and local focus on wellness and to some extent even wellbeing (see Seattle\u2019s Happiness Index, the Gallup Healthways Well-being Index), there has been far less focus on how to translate that information into meaningful action that can be executed by communities as a whole.\u201d  Very few officials, in other words, have actually chosen to steer by the \u201cwellbeing measurement dashboards\u201d so far engineered. Will Santa Monica\u2019s choose differently? With the data collected and the findings released, the operation seems to have entered a wait-and-see phase \u2013 or, as the report puts it, a time \u201cto ensure the data motivate community discussions about potential solutions\u201d. \u201cThe Wellbeing Project is equipped to inform,\u201d says Islas. \u201cIt\u2019s really a question of what leaders do with that information. My concern is that ideology would trump good decision-making \u2026 People talk about the need for affordable housing, but what policies have we adopted that would actually make that a reality?\u201d In fact, the city recently voted to remove the option of building new four- and five-storey mixed-use residential buildings along its major boulevards. Some decision-makers have their own ideas about how to use the Wellbeing Project\u2019s data: mayor Kevin McKeown (an opponent of those new residential buildings) mentions that its documentation of the high stress felt by residents of houses in the vicinity of Santa Monica airport will provide valuable evidence in his case against the city\u2019s obligation to run an airport at all.     The city recently voted to remove the option of building new four- and five-storey mixed-use residential buildings along its major boulevards. Photograph: Getty Images/Lonely Planet/Jean-Pierre Lescourret    \u201cWe\u2019ve always had to rely on intuition, common sense and good intentions,\u201d says McKeown. \u201cNow we have data.\u201d The Wellbeing Project has, at least at this early stage, looked like an important step toward putting Santa Monica at the forefront of the much-discussed age of the \u2018data-driven city\u2019, where constant streams of precision-collected information curated for maximum relevance \u2013 a kind of perpetually updated Wellbeing Index \u2013 would enable both residents and officials to make more beneficial choices for the community and for themselves. This ideal harmonises well with Santa Monica\u2019s recent hiring of Rick Cole as city manager, who is a well-respected if peripatetic Southern California city official and high-profile advocate of \u201cdata-driven governance\u201d, who has spent the last two years as Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s deputy for budget and innovation. He, too, sees setting a global example as a significant part the city\u2019s mission: \u201cIf, with all of our educational and financial resources, Santa Monica can\u2019t be an exemplary model,\u201d he said in an interview with Islas, \u201cthen what hope is there for Jakarta or Johannesburg or Manila or Kinshasa or, for that matter, Shanghai and Shenzhen?\u201d   Related: Los Angeles: a city that outgrew its masterplan. Thank God    Los Angeles, as Cole put it in a much-quoted parting shot, \u201cis not designed to work\u201d. Santa Monica, by contrast \u2013 or so its well-established community partisans might tell you \u2014 is. McKeown tells of receiving complaints that the city fixes potholes too frequently, which would certainly never make the long list of resident grievances in Los Angeles. The Wellbeing Project could, it seems, have no more suitable proving ground than this compact, manageable (in Cole\u2019s words) \u201ccool city that has money\u201d \u2013 but what about the larger, considerably more troubled metropolises of the world, starting with the one just past Santa Monica\u2019s city limits? That question interests Bloomberg Philanthropies above all others. \u201cSanta Monica is regarded as a fairly special place,\u201d says James Anderson, leader of Bloomberg\u2019s public sector innovation programmes, \u201cbut the idea is one that mayors everywhere are contending with. Is this a solution that addresses issues many cities face? Does it require any \u2018special sauce\u2019 that may be present in one locality but not others? We actually think this idea very much passed those tests. It\u2019s an idea other cities can readily implement, and Santa Monica is creating a toolkit, a playbook, that will allow other cities to follow.\u201d  Or, in Islas\u2019s words: \u201cIf Santa Monica can\u2019t do it, what hope is there for places that don\u2019t have the resources it has?\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "tags": ["Cities", "California", "California holidays", "Los Angeles", "US news", "World news", "United States holidays", "North and Central America holidays", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-21T13:24:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/22/taylor-swift-1989-china-clothing-line-tiananmen-square", "sentences": ["The date \u2013 as well as being Swift\u2019s year of birth \u2013 refers to her album and live tour of the same name, which she will perform in Shanghai in November."], "title": "Taylor Swift 1989 Chinese clothing line risks Tiananmen Square row", "article": "Taylor Swift may have inadvertently walked into a political maelstrom in China with merchandise soon to be on sale there displaying a potentially subversive message.

The new regulation, under which all Chinese couples would be allowed to have two children, could be implemented \u201cas soon as the end of the year if everything goes well\u201d, a government source was quoted as saying by the China Business News. The highly controversial and often brutally enforced one-child policy was introduced by China\u2019s Communist leaders in 1980 amid fears of a catastrophic population explosion. The government credits it with preventing 400 million births, but the human cost has been immense, with forced sterilisations and abortions, infanticide, and a dramatic gender imbalance that means millions of men will never find female partners.   Related: China\u2019s little emperors \u2013 the children without siblings    In 2012 \u2013 in one of the most shocking recent cases of human rights abuses related to the policy \u2013 a 23-year-old woman from Shaanxi province in north-west China was abducted by family planning officials and forced to have an abortion seven months into the pregnancy. Liang Zhongtang, a demographer from the Shanghai Academy of Social Science, said the policy should have been abolished long ago. \u201cThe core issue is not about one child or two children. It\u2019s about reproductive freedom. It\u2019s about basic human rights. In the past, the government failed to grasp the essence of the issue,\u201d he said. Beijing quickly played down claims that the two-child policy would be in place by the end of the year. \u201cNo timetable has been set to allow all couples in the country to have a second child,\u201d the national health and family planning commission insisted, according to the state-run China Daily. Lu Jiehua, a professor of demographics at Peking University, told the Global Times the change was more likely to come next year. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply about implementing a second-child policy. All relevant policies, regulations, formalities and facilities need to be in place to support [the policy] and it takes time.\u201d Liang said the apparent decision to bring in a two-child policy had been driven by growing public opposition to family planning laws. The internet \u2013 to which nearly 650 million Chinese people are now connected \u2013 had made public hostility more visible and more powerful. He added: \u201cThe government \u2013 under increasing public pressure \u2013 has to respond to people\u2019s demands.\u201d Moves to loosen strict birth control rules are also a response to a demographic \u201ctimebomb\u201d created by the one-child policy. Experts warn that China\u2019s 1.3 billion-strong population is ageing rapidly, while the labour pool is shrinking. The country will have nearly 440 million over-60s by 2050, according to UN estimates, placing a massive strain on government resources.  Meanwhile, the working-age population \u2013 those aged between 15 and 59 \u2013 fell by 3.71 million last year, a trend that is expected to continue. If that trend is not reversed, \u201cthe future for China\u2019s economy will look grim\u201d, said Yi Fuxian, a demographer and outspoken critic of the one-child policy.  In recent years, there has been a gradual relaxation of China\u2019s family planning laws, which already permitted ethnic minority families and rural couples whose firstborn was a girl to have more than one child. Since 2013, couples in many parts of the country have been allowed to have two children if one parent was an only child.    At the moment, many people are not willing to have more children, even if they are encouraged to do so  Liang Zhongtang     State media have celebrated the results of that policy shift, pointing to an additional 470,000 births in 2014 compared with the year before. But the mini-baby boom authorities had hoped for has failed to materialise. Experts say the fertility rate is not rising fast enough, with financial constraints putting many urban couples off having a second child. \u201cThe change is imperative,\u201d said Yi, whose book, A Big Country with an Empty Nest, attacks his country\u2019s family planning policies. \u201cThe government\u2019s selective two-child policy has proved a failure. Scrapping [the] one-child policy is the only sensible solution to China\u2019s population crisis.\u201d Speaking earlier this month, Yang Wenzhuang, a senior family planning official, admitted China needed to act fast to \u201caddress a major demographic challenge facing the nation\u201d. Liang said Beijing\u2019s apparent decision to scrap the one-child policy was a positive and long overdue step. But even a full shift to a nationwide two-child policy would do little to reverse the demographic trends already set in place. \u201cAt the moment, many people are not willing to have more children, even if they are encouraged to do so. So in reality the government introducing the two-child policy still won\u2019t have much of an impact,\u201d he said. Last year, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences warned that China was close to falling into the so-called \u201clow fertility trap\u201d, a vicious cycle from which countries find it hard to escape. For an estimated 2 million \u201corphaned\u201d parents \u2013 who lost the only child the Communist party allowed them to have \u2013 news of the impending policy change brought little comfort. Huo Daozhong, a 58-year-old from Henan province whose only son killed himself in 2013, said: \u201cIt\u2019s too late. The policy has nothing to do with us now.\u201d Each year, around 76,000 families join the ranks of China\u2019s so-called \u201cshidu\u201d families when their only children die. \u201cHe was only 30 years old when he died.

A man of great energy and compassion, he took on this struggling inner-city parish and, with his wife, Sue, over three decades built up two thriving and vibrant churches. He was born Warrington Graham Corneck in Shanghai, the son of Christine (nee Foster) and Philip, who was working there as the secretary of a rowing club. The family returned to England in 1939, when Graham was four, and he grew up with his younger sister, Anne, in East Sheen, south-west London. He went to Latymer Upper school in Hammersmith, where he developed a passion for running, and would often run the seven and half miles of Richmond Park wall. Later, living in Deptford, he completed the second London Marathon. The 46-year-old \u201crunning vicar\u201d was one of several competitors whose training, under Chris Brasher, was followed by the Observer. An avid Christian, in adulthood Graham joined the evangelical hub of All Souls Church, Langham Place, in central London. There he met Susan Baughan, and they married in 1963. Graham had qualified as a chartered accountant but said he was \u201chopeless\u201d at the job and, in 1962, followed his calling and went to Clifton Theological College (now Trinity College) in Bristol. Ordained in 1965, he was curate at St Jude\u2019s, Islington, north London, before moving to Crawley in Sussex as priest in charge of St Andrew\u2019s, Furnace Green. In 1973, our family moved to Deptford. The parish was one of poverty and deprivation, and 19 priests had already turned down the post. St Luke\u2019s had a congregation of six and St Nicholas\u2019s one of eight; one of Graham\u2019s first services at St Nick\u2019s was to people who could not read. At first daunted by the scale of the task, they set to work to create an inclusive community, making services accessible through music and dramas drawn from the weekly Bible texts, and opening their home to visitors, some of whom stayed for years living as part of our family. Graham was a charismatic preacher, passionate about communicating his Christian faith. He once gave a sermon from under the altar table to illustrate how anger obstructs our relationships. A film lover, in 1988 he broadcast a series of four meditations on BBC Radio 4, reflecting on how stories from cinema can illuminate faith. In 1995, Graham graduated with a master\u2019s in theology from Edinburgh University. He was an honorary canon of Southwark cathedral (1991-2005), and was appointed MBE in 2004 for services to the community. In retirement, he found his failing health frustrating, but continued to preach and to conduct funerals, and he took deep pleasure from his home life with Sue, and enjoyed supporting me and my sisters, Hannah and Rebecca, and his seven grandchildren, all of whom survive him.", "tags": ["Anglicanism", "London", "Religion"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-23T15:49:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/24/australian-dollar-hits-fresh-six-year-low-as-chinese-factories-continue-to-falter", "sentences": ["Hong Kong\u2019s Hangseng index was down 0.92% and the Shanghai Composite index, where many of the stocks are still suspended after June\u2019s crash, was up slightly by 0.16%."], "title": "Australian dollar hits fresh six-year low as Chinese factories continue to falter", "article": "The Australian dollar fell to a fresh six-year low and stocks across Asia dropped sharply after more signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy.

With a population of 1.35bn people, making an impression there is becoming vital for European clubs seeking fans and their spending power. This week the European heavyweights Bayern Munich, Internazionale and Real Madrid are all touring China, hoping to raise their profiles in what has the potential to be a massive market for foreign clubs. Bayern were greeted by a stadium full of enthusiastic fans as they beat Valencia in Beijing last weekend. Football now ranks as one of the most popular spectator sports in China. Foreign clubs are proving a hit with the Chinese. China\u2019s sheer size and burgeoning middle class with increasing spending power make it an attractive place to break into and Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool, as well as Barcelona, have all played pre-season games there in recent years. \u201cChina is attractive for its huge population, fast-growing economy and also passionate football fans,\u201d says Vincent Chan, account manager for Mailman, a China-based sporting and consulting group. \u201cFootball is the most popular sport in China.\u201d     Mesut \u00d6zil and Karim Benzema playing with children from a Chinese football school during Real Madrid\u2019s pre-season tour in 2011. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    Clubs are not just competing on the pitch in China, they are also competing to build an online presence throughout the year. Language has in the past proved a barrier for teams hoping to engage with fans in the country through their English-language websites, while internet restrictions have meant Chinese fans cannot follow their teams on western social media sites. This has been a big issue for teams and fans alike, according to Chan: \u201cWithout Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, fans are really frustrated that they cannot directly interact with the players.\u201d In response a growing number of European clubs have developed websites in Mandarin and produced content for their Chinese fans. After Liverpool launched an official presence on Chinese social media in 2011 there are now more than 30 clubs active on sites such as Weibo, a microblogging site similar to Twitter. The level of interaction from club to club varies and Chan reckons Manchester United are the most successful while Milan, Real Madrid and Bayern have been making big inroads. According to Mailman\u2019s research, German football has gained popularity after the launch of an official Bundesliga Weibo account and Germany\u2019s success at the World Cup. Borussia Dortmund, for example, gained more than a million new followers in under a year on social media. Mailman described Bayern as a \u201cfan favourite\u201d, underlined by the fervour generated by the German champions\u2019 presence in China. Real Madrid are rated the most successful team online this year, topping Mailman\u2019s Red Card table.     Demba Ba, the former Newcastle and Chelsea striker, announces his arrival for Shanghai Shenhua in the Chinese Super League. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images    A team\u2019s success in their own league also plays a key role, as a Mailman report explains. \u201cThe relationship with winning and fan development is no more prevalent than in China, where many fans support multiple teams without the direct attachment to location or family upbringing,\u201d it says. Bob Liang is a Shanghai-based Liverpool supporter, attracted to the club for \u201cits stars such as Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres, Michael Owen, Luis Su\u00e1rez, for its rich and successful history\u201d and because \u201cit is still the English club with most major trophies\u201d. He says he is also drawn in by \u201cthe famous team song YNWA \u2026 for its spirit of never giving up and for its attacking playing style\u201d. Domestic sides are at last seeing their fanbase grow after years of having a poor reputation. Liang, for one, follows his local team, Shanghai Shenhua. The sport had been rocked by corruption scandals with officials being jailed for match-fixing and taking bribes, while the lacklustre national team also contributed to a lack of faith in the homegrown game. According to the state news agency Xinhua, football was seen as an \u201cembarrassment to the nation\u201d.     The Evergrande Football School in Qingyuan is an impressive example of increasing investment in the sport in China. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images    Yet the popularity and importance of domestic football is evolving. Earlier this year a government initiative was launched to improve football standards in China with plans to build tens of thousands of pitches and football training being introduced to 50,000 schools by 2025. The fortunes of the national team are also on the up after reaching the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup in January. Chinese clubs with big budgets are snapping up high-profile foreign players, with Shanghai Shenhua recently spending \u00a311.3m for the former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, while Guangzhou Evergrande spent \u00a39.9m on the Brazilian midfielder Paulinho. He was joinedin the Chinese Super League last week by Robinho, who also signed for Luiz Felipe Scolari\u2019s side. The lack of a quality domestic scene is not the only possible reason international clubs find such favour in China. Cameron Wilson, editor of Wild East Football \u2013 an English language website about Chinese football \u2013 cites the example of Japanese football, which has a well-established domestic scene but where foreign clubs are also hugely popular. Wilson believes it is more to do with the importance of image. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to why Luis Vuitton and Gucci are successful in China, because they are seen as being something successful and desirable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe big names in European football are also seen as being glamorous and successful. It\u2019s a triumph of marketing over actual sporting substance.\u201d     Arsenal shirts featuring Chinese lettering were used during the club\u2019s pre-season tour in 2012.  Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images    Foreign clubs are also seeking to increase their revenue from their growing Chinese fanbase, which is proving more difficult than gaining fans. Some are now selling merchandise through popular Chinese online marketplaces. Bayern, for example, announced in May they had partnered with the e-commerce giant Alibaba to open an online store on the popular tmall.com marketplace. Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham likewise have stores on the site. Chan says it takes time for clubs to turn a profit in China. \u201cBut as long as they stick to the Chinese market it is only a matter of time,\u201d he said. Commercial partnerships with popular brands from the country can help forge links. \u201cThere has been some sponsorship from Chinese companies to foreign clubs such as Huawei, Wahaha and Wanda,\u201d Chan adds. However, while Premier League and European clubs are trying to steal a march on each other in China, Wilson believes many are still missing the mark. \u201cI think they have had some success but they don\u2019t always engage Chinese fans on the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of the big teams are not in tune with China.

Today\u2019s developments are just going to put this even more at the centre of their economic problems.\u201d The latest day of frenzied selling \u2013 which analysts said reflected weaker economic data out of China as well as a lack of confidence in Beijing\u2019s response to ongoing stock market chaos \u2013 was a slap in the face for the country\u2019s Communist party leaders. Beijing launched an unprecedented push to prop up the country\u2019s stock market after a collapse that began in mid-June saw more than $3tn wiped off the value of listed companies.  Until Monday, those efforts, which also included freezing IPOs, appeared to have brought some measure of stability. The Shanghai index had rebounded more than 15% from the worst levels of the crisis in early July.   Shanghai Composite Index Shanghai Composite Index   But in a note following the latest slump, analysts at consultancy Capital Economics wrote: \u201cThe lesson from China\u2019s last equity bubble is that, once sentiment has soured, policy interventions aimed at shoring up prices have only a short-lived effect.\u201d Biswas, the IHS economist, said Beijing\u2019s attempts to turn the situation around by intervening in the stock market were doomed to fail.  \u201cIn my view they really have to now respond more forcefully with monetary and fiscal stimulus to try and get the economy on an upward track again. So instead of trying to address the stock market they need to address the real economy, which I think is the root problem right now that people perceive in China that the economy itself is struggling,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou need to convince investors and consumers that the real economy is stabilising and is going to be improving. That has not happened yet. All the signals are convincing investors that the economy is on the way down and until that perception changes it is going to be very hard to put a floor under the stock market.\u201d  Louis Tse, the director of Hong Kong\u2019s VC Brokerage, told the South China Morning Post: \u201cSentiment among investors is quite poor. They\u2019re selling stock to try to retrieve their money, especially from blue chips and in the A-share market when the Shanghai Composite reaches 4,000 points.\u201d  Chinese investors took to social media to mourn their losses following the latest day of turmoil.  \u201cPeople ask me how I feel about the fall,\u201d one investor wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter. \u201cI have only these few words \u2013 I am used to it.\u201d  Another panicky investor wrote: \u201cIf you stay in the market, you will lose all your money.

Nearly 1,800 stocks \u2013 or more than 60% of shares on the main markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen \u2013 fell by the daily limit of 10%, thereby triggering a trading suspension. If such a limit had not been in operation, who knows where prices might have settled. An 8.5% overall fall in the Shanghai Composite might have been 18.5% or 28.5%. Almost any guess is credible.   Related: Beijing's desperate attempts to control the stock market will end badly    What was the trigger? The question misses the point. By intervening in the market in various ham-fisted ways \u2013 forcing state funds to buy shares, banning sales by big investors, pumping cheap loans into broking firms \u2013 Beijing has turned its stock market into a giant game of guessing how long such artificial props can be maintained. Sooner or later, a big fall was bound to arrive because everybody knows \u2013 or should know \u2013 that valuations remain absurdly high. The Shanghai market, after all, is still up 70% year-on-year and is still stuffed with companies valued at 40-plus times earnings. For the past three weeks, the Beijing authorities might have kidded themselves they had stopped the rot. The Shanghai Composite had bounced 17% from its low point at the beginning of the month. But half of that gain evaporated in a single trading session on Monday, demonstrating that fear in stock markets cannot be eradicated on the orders of Beijing. It\u2019s hard to know what the authorities will try next. Two limit-down days in a row would be an embarrassing demonstration of Beijing\u2019s loss of control of events. But summoning heavier armoury, in the form of larger state-sponsored buying of stocks, would bring greater problems around the corner. Equally, another cut in interest rates would probably be counter-productive; foreign investors would conclude that monetary policy is being set for the stock market rather than for the real economy. When in a hole, the traditional advice is stop digging. It\u2019s a sound principle, and one Beijing will probably ignore. Varoufakis\u2019s plan B \u2026 B for barmy At a push, one might say the government in Athens was duty-bound to work on a plan B in case bailout talks collapsed, liquidity from the European Central Bank was cut off, and Greek banks remained shut. But former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s idea to set up a parallel payment system suffered from two obvious flaws.   Related: Greece crisis: Yanis Varoufakis admits 'contingency plan' for euro exit    First, it required a crack team to hack into the public revenue office\u2019s software to copy individuals\u2019 tax codes. Varoufakis\u2019s explanation is that the plan had to be kept quiet in case the dreaded troika of lenders got wind of it. OK, but the idea that a few individuals could design a robust new payments system from scratch, and in secret, is simply not credible. Payments technology and smartphone apps are not cheap or easy to develop \u2013 just ask any UK bank. The second problem is even more fundamental. If the payments system had been launched, the creditors might have declared that Grexit had already happened on the ground. That would not have helped a Greek government still hoping for a deal. Regard the tale, then, as a strange subplot to the Greek crisis, of which the oddest part is Varoufakis\u2019s apparent belief that his secret plan could remain secret even after he had related it on a conference call to a bunch of hedge fund managers earlier this month. GVC taking a gamble on takeover bid An AIM-listed company worth \u00a3260m would normally struggle, to put it mildly, to make a \u00a31bn takeover offer for a rival. So top marks to GVC, owner of Sportingbet, for getting this far in its attempt to defeat 888 and win the scrap for Bwin.party Digital Entertainment, the oddly named and badly performing combination of the old PartyGaming and an Austrian outfit. Even so, GVC\u2019s offer looks to be a stretch and a half. In its latest incarnation, the proposal is just 20% in cash, funded largely via a \u20ac400m secured loan from New York hedge fund Cerberus. The rest of the offer would comprise new GVC shares. There would be also be a separate share placing by GVC to raise \u00a3150m to fund restructuring. That\u2019s an awful lot of GVC equity to be digested. Maybe the appetite exists \u2013 GVC share prices fell only 2% on Monday \u2013 but it would be a brave Bwin board that switched its recommendation away from 888 at this point. 888\u2019s offer could hardly be described as conservative, but it is putting slightly more cash on the table, which may be the critical factor in the end. The most likely outcome is the common-sense one: 888 adds a few pennies to its offer and Bwin\u2019s directors stick with the bidder they chose the first time round.", "tags": ["China", "Yanis Varoufakis", "Gambling", "Asia Pacific", "Eurozone crisis", "World news", "Economics", "Europe", "European Union", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-27T19:02:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/28/beijing-prop-up-china-stock-market-losses", "sentences": ["\u201cThere are a lot of different parts of the economy that are showing weakness and the collapse of the stock market is just another symptom of the fragility of the Chinese economy right now.\u201d Following three weeks of relative calm, the Shanghai Composite Index plummeted on Monday, ending down 8.5% at 3725.56 \u2013 its worst fall since February 2007."], "title": "China's stock market remains jittery after greatest losses since 2007", "article": "Beijing has vowed to step up its interventions in China\u2019s volatile stock market following a traumatic day on Monday when stocks suffered their greatest losses since 2007.

The year before that, Alexander Payne\u2019s Nebraska managed the same feat, netting several nominations after premiering at Cannes in May. With that in mind, here are 30 films that stand a good chance at following a similar path this awards season. 45 Years              Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay earned raves out of the Berlin international film festival earlier in the year for 45 Years, Andrew Haigh\u2019s follow-up to the gay romance Weekend. The two give award-worthy performances as a long-married couple whose relationship is put under severe stress after the dead body of the husband\u2019s first love is discovered. Where it premiered: Berlin, where both leads shared an actor prize. It opens in August in the UK and in the US this fall. Possible major nominations: Actor for Courtenay and actress for Rampling. Amy              No documentary has received more attention this year than Amy \u2013 Asif Kapadia\u2019s devastating follow-up to his Bafta-winning sports doc Senna \u2013 which tracks the rise and fall of Amy Winehouse, who died at 27 of alcohol poisoning. Using never-before-seen archival footage and audio from exclusive interviews, Kapadia gives Winehouse the masterful portrait she deserves. Where it premiered: Cannes, out of competition. Possible major nominations: Documentary feature. Brooklyn            Sundance produced no surefire Oscar bets like Whiplash or Beasts of the Southern Wild this year, but John Crowley\u2019s Brooklyn, a period romance based on Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn\u2019s 2009 novel, emerged as a dark horse. Saoirse Ronan is exceptional as a young Irish woman who leaves the comfort of her mother\u2019s home in Ireland for Brooklyn in 1952. After soon falling for an Italian American man (Emory Cohen), she\u2019s forced to consider a move back to Ireland after learning of some devastating news. Where it premiered: Sundance; it opens this fall. Possible major nominations: Picture, actress for Ronan, and screenplay. Carol              Already considered a frontrunner following its premiere at Cannes, where Cate Blanchett\u2019s co-star in the drama, Rooney Mara, collected a best actress prize; Todd Haynes\u2019 period lesbian romance is sure to gather momentum during the fall ahead of its Christmas release. Where it premiered: Cannes, where Mara won best actress. It opens Christmas day. Possible major nominations: Picture, director, actress for Blanchett, supporting actress for Mara, and screenplay. Cartel Land            Film-maker Matthew Heineman embedded himself with two modern-day vigilante groups trying to take down the murderous Mexican drug cartels, to deliver Cartel Land, a definitive look inside the inner workings of the war on drugs. After winning best director at Sundance following its premiere, director Kathryn Bigelow signed on as executive producer, boding well for its Oscar chances. Where it premiered: Sundance. Possible major nominations: Documentary feature. Clouds of Sils Maria              Kristen Stewart made history this year as the first American to win France\u2019s prestigious C\u00e9sar award for best supporting actress for her revelatory performance as an assistant to a demanding actor (Juliette Binoche) in Olivier Assayas\u2019s drama Clouds of Sils Maria. The film doesn\u2019t have much momentum going into awards season since it came out earlier in the year, but don\u2019t rule Stewart out. Where it premiered: Last year\u2019s Cannes. Possible major nominations: Supporting actress for Stewart. The Diary of a Teenage Girl            Marielle Heller\u2019s feature debut The Diary of a Teenage Girl was one of the major breakouts at Sundance with its tender tale of a teen in 1970s San Francisco coming of age by having an affair with her mother\u2019s boyfriend. Bel Powley is a revelation as the sexually liberated teen, and Kristen Wiig surprises with a layered performance as her alcoholic mother.  Where it premiered: Sundance, where it won best cinematography; it opens in August in the US. Possible major nominations: Actress for Powley, supporting actress for Wiig, and screenplay. The End of the Tour            Jason Segel entered Sundance as a proven comedian and left the festival as an acclaimed dramatic actor, thanks to his powerful performance as Infinite Jest novelist David Foster Wallace in James Ponsoldt\u2019s heady two-hander, The End of the Tour. The How I Met Your Mother actor digs deep opposite a strong Jesse Eisenberg, who plays a Rolling Stone reporter engaged in a five-day interview with the writer. Where it premiered: Sundance; it opens this August in the US. Possible major nominations: Actor for Segel and screenplay. Ex Machina              Swedish actor Alicia Vikander has had one hell of a year with performances in Testament of Youth and Guy Ritchie\u2019s upcoming The Man From UNCLE, both raising her profile. However, it\u2019s her remarkable turn as a mysterious robot in Alex Garland\u2019s science fiction shocker, Ex Machina, that\u2019s sure to leave the biggest impression with awards voters. Where it premiered: SXSW, in North America; it opened in the UK in the spring. Possible major nominations: Actress for Vikander. Far from the Madding Crowd              Carey Mulligan has never given a bad performance after coming out of nowhere to net an Oscar nomination for An Education in 2010, but in Far From the Madding Crowd, the actor has arguably found her best role since that breakthrough. She gives it her all in Thomas Vinterberg\u2019s adaptation of Thomas Hardy\u2019s classic novel, as a fiercely independent woman torn between three eligible suitors. Where it premiered: Opened in the spring. Possible major nominations: Actress for Mullligan. Grandma            Lily Tomlin just earned an Emmy nomination for her work opposite Jane Fonda in Netflix\u2019s Grace and Frankie, and she stands a good shot at also earning an Oscar nod for her powerful lead performance in Grandma, Paul Weitz\u2019s dramedy that premiered at Sundance. The comedy legend is a force as a cantankerous lesbian poet on a road trip with her granddaughter. Where it premiered: Sundance; it opens late August. Possible major nominations: Actress for Tomlin. Hello, My Name is Doris            Two-time Oscar winner Sally Field is given a rare lead role in Hello, My Name is Doris, and flies with it, giving one of the best performances of her career in Michael Showalter\u2019s affecting comedy. She plays Doris, a 60-year-old Staten Island resident who sparks up an unlikely courtship with a much younger co-worker following the death of her mother. Where it premiered: SXSW; opens later in the year. Possible major nominations: Actress for Field. I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams            Tony- and Emmy-winning actor Blythe Danner was the belle of Sundance for her nuanced performance in the drama I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams and, along with Lily Tomlin, emerged as a possible awards contender. She\u2019s wonderful in Brett Haley\u2019s sensitive film as a widow of many decades who finds herself exploring new and surprising relationships. Where it premiered: Sundance; opened this summer. Possible major nominations: Actress for Danner. I Smile Back     Sarah Silverman and Josh Charles in I Smile Back. Photograph: PR    Sarah Silverman shocked Sundance with a harrowing dramatic performance as a depressed housewife struggling with addiction in Adam Salky\u2019s pitch-black drama, I Smile Black. The popular comedian, who struggled with depression in her own life, dug deep for the role and the results are astonishing and worthy of awards consideration. Where it premiered: Sundance; it opens in the US this October. Possible major nominations: Actress for Silverman. Inside Out              Two years after disappointing with Monsters University, Pixar returned with a vengeance with Inside Out, Pete Doctor\u2019s animated stunner that broke records when it opened this summer and moved audiences with its heartwarming tale that takes place inside the head of a sad young girl. Where it premiered: Cannes, out of competition. Possible major nominations: Animated feature and (possibly) best picture.  James White     James White.

The film was also a hit at the festival, winning the NEXT section\u2019s audience award. Nixon, who\u2019s been ill-served by Hollywood since ending her run on Sex and the City, is deserving of attention going into awards season. Where it premiered: Sundance; it opens this fall. Possible major nominations: Supporting actress for Nixon. Krisha     Krisha Fairchild. Photograph: A24    Writer/director Trey Edward Shults owned Austin\u2019s SXSW film festival this spring with his autobiographical debut Krisha, starring his own aunt Krisha Fairchild in the lead role. The actor commands the screen as a drug and alcohol abuser who reunites with her family for a holiday gathering after a year of absence. Her performance is so strong it calls to mind Gena Rowlands\u2019 legendary turn in A Woman Under the Influence. Where it premiered: SXSW, where it won the audience and grand jury prize. Possible major nominations: Actress for Fairchild. The Look of Silence              Joshua Oppenheimer received an Oscar nomination for The Act of Killing, his troubling documentary that profiled some perpetrators of the Indonesian genocide, by having them re-enact their appalling crimes. He should also be recognized for his follow-up The Look of Silence, which takes a different approach to recounting the events by exploring what it\u2019s like to be a survivor of such a brutal experience. Where it premiered: Last year\u2019s Telluride international film festival. Possible major nominations: Documentary feature. Love &amp; Mercy              Acclaimed when it premiered last year in Toronto, Bill Pohlad\u2019s Brian Wilson biopic Love &amp; Mercy, opened this summer to strong notices for Paul Dano\u2019s committed performance as the Beach Boys member that should serve the actor well going into awards season. Elizabeth Banks is also tremendously affecting as Wilson\u2019s partner. Where it premiered: Last year\u2019s Toronto international film festival. Possible major nominations: Actor for Dano and supporting actress for Banks. Macbeth              Justin Kurzel\u2019s follow-up to Snowtown split some critics upon its debut at Cannes in May, but the majority agreed that its two leads, Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, give it their all in this bracing Shakespeare adaptation. Each could figure in the awards race, with enough of a push from distributor Harvey Weinstein. Where it premiered: Cannes in competition. Possible major nominations: Actor for Fassbender and actress for Cotillard. Mad Max: Fury Road              It\u2019s not often an action movie drums up Oscar buzz, but such is the case with Mad Max: Fury Road, George Miller\u2019s sensational return to the franchise that made his name. The film is one of the best of the year, propelled by Charlize Theron\u2019s soon-to-be legendary performance as the warrior Imperator Furiosa. Where it premiered: Cannes out of competition. Possible major nominations: Director, and actress for Theron. Mistress America            Following their first collaboration Frances Ha, Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig are back with Mistress America, a witty comedy that has earned acclaim on the festival circuit for its rapid-fire banter and appealing performances from Gerwig and relative newcomer Lola Kirke. Where it premiered: Sundance; it opens this August. Possible major nominations: Screenplay. Mr Holmes              The last time Ian McKellen worked with director Bill Condon, it resulted in his first Oscar nomination for Gods and Monsters. He\u2019s deserving of another nom for reuniting with the film-maker for Mr Holmes, a richly rewarding character study centered on a retired, 93-year-old Sherlock Holmes. In it, McKellen gives one of his most subtle and quietly moving performances as a genius dealing with the deterioration of his once incredible mind.  Where it premiered: Berlin; it\u2019s currently playing in theaters. Possible major nominations: Actor for McKellen. Sicario            Sicario, Denis Villeneuve\u2019s grim exploration on America\u2019s war against drugs, is as harrowing and dark as the director\u2019s Oscar nominated Prisoners. Emily Blunt is commanding as an FBI agent searching for answers, and Villeneuve is again well-served by the exceptional work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, who he formerly collaborated with on Prisoners. Where it premiered: Cannes in competition; opens in September. Possible major nominations: Director and actress for Blunt. Son of Saul              A major hit with critics at Cannes, where it won the runner-up prize to the Palme d\u2019Or, Son of Saul is one of the most intense Holocaust movies ever attempted. Told from the perspective of a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz tasked with the disposal of gas chamber victims, it\u2019s the work of first-time feature director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, previously a mentee for B\u00e9la Tarr. Sony Pictures Classics acquired it out of Cannes, boding very well for its Oscar chances. Where it premiered: Cannes, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. Possible major nominations: Locked for foreign language feature, but could also net picture, director and actor for G\u00e9za R\u00f6hrig, who plays Saul.  Southpaw              Antoine Fuqua\u2019s boxing drama Southpaw was greeted with mixed reviews before opening last week, but there\u2019s no denying that Jake Gyllenhaal is stellar as a fighter at the end of this rope in the film. Much has been made of the startling physical transformation he made for the role, and the Oscars are known for rewarding actors who go the distance for a project. Where it premiered: Shanghai film festival; it\u2019s currently playing in theaters. Possible major nominations: Actor for Gyllenhaal. Trainwreck              Kristen Wiig earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the Judd Apatow-produced hit comedy Bridesmaids in 2012. For the Apatow-directed comedy Trainwreck, comedian Amy Schumer seems all but certain to follow in her steps. It would mark an amzing cap to a phenomenal year for the funny lady. Where it premiered: SXSW; it\u2019s currently playing in theaters. Possible major nominations: Screenplay. Youth            Michael Caine entered the Oscar race back in May upon the debut of Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s follow-up to Oscar winner The Great Beauty. In Youth, Sorrentino\u2019s first English-language feature since 2011\u2019s This Must Be the Place, Caine gives a tremendously appealing performance as a famed composer, enjoying an extended stay at an elegant hotel at the foot of the Alps. Keitel is amusing as Caine\u2019s best friend and cameoing Jane Fonda is a force of nature. Where it premiered: Cannes in competition. Possible major nominations: Actor for Michael Caine, supporting actor for Harvey Keitel, supporting actress for a scene-stealing Jane Fonda and screenplay. The Witch     The Witch. Photograph: A24    Horror films are typically overlooked by the Academy, but the film-making skill on display in Robert Eggers\u2019s phenomenally effective bone-chiller The Witch, is cause for celebration. Eggers won best director at Sundance for his debut, and is sure to build a rabid following when more get their eyes on The Witch. Where it premiered: Sundance; no release date has been set of yet. Possible major nominations: In a perfect world: picture, director, and actress for startling newcomer Anya Taylor-Joy. The Wolfpack            The Wolfpack is one of the most bizarre documentaries to come out in a long while \u2013 and it\u2019s also one of the most fascinating. Crystal Moselle\u2019s portrait of six teen brothers whose father forced them to spend their entire childhood locked away from the outside world in a cramped apartment on New York\u2019s Lower East Side, blew away Sundance audiences, resulting in a Grand Jury Prize win for the first-time film-maker.

Related: Chinese shares suffer further falls    Most did not want to talk about how much they had lost or whether they still had faith in the government. Questions were batted away with a resigned wave of a hand. One middle-aged man was leaning over a terminal with his hand on his head in what looked like despair. Heated discussions broke out between four people nearby, apparently discussing which types of stocks were performing better. Three unhappy-looking women were sitting on orange plastic chairs taking a break from trading. \u201cEveryone is in a bad mood because they are losing money,\u201d said one of the women who did not want to be named. \u201cToday is not a good day to be asking these questions,\u201d she added angrily.  Mr Yuan, standing across the room, was calmly entering data on a computer terminal, deciding what to sell. \u201cI personally have not lost a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cI have sold out all the stocks that I held.\u201d Although he thought the government should take further action, he didn\u2019t think this week\u2019s losses showed the government\u2019s intervention had necessarily failed. China\u2019s stock market \u201cis like a psycho \u2013 it has been up and down too great a degree,\u201d he said, adding that investors had become greedy and did not have a \u201cstabilised attitude\u201d to the market. Mr Zhou nearby was also standing over a screen, eager to stress he had not lost money, prompting a sceptical laugh from a woman at the neighbouring terminal. He does not blame the government for the ongoing volatility. \u201cThe stock market has its own way to function,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether the country [intervenes] or not, it has not much to do with the stock market.\u201d Both Zhou and Yuan said that the Chinese stock markets had changed and that big profits can no longer be made. \u201cWe should focus on short-term investment,\u201d said Yuan. Zhou outlined his new strategy: \u201cYou buy in when it\u2019s 5 yuan, you sell out when it\u2019s 7 yuan and you gain 2 yuan. That\u2019s it.\u201d   ", "tags": ["Chinese economy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Business", "World news", "Stock markets", "Investing", "Financial sector"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-28T10:00:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/28/chinese-shares-suffer-further-falls", "sentences": ["On Tuesday the Shanghai Composite index initially fell more than 4% before rebounding and closing nearly 1.7% down at 3,663.82.", "Related: Shanghai investors keep calm amid the stock market storm      Bernard Aw, a market analyst at spreadbetting firm IG, said: \u201cThings don\u2019t look that bad today but we need to see a few more sessions to gauge whether the sharp decline of [Monday] has reached a bottom.", "Related: Stock market advice for China: when in a hole, stop digging    An editorial in the Shanghai Securities Daily, a state-run newspaper, said: \u201cIn the future, the market will not fall off a cliff."], "title": "Global markets steady despite further falls in Chinese shares", "article": "Global markets have steadied despite a second successive day of declines in Chinese shares, as Beijing battled to rein in the stock market turmoil that has returned to haunt the world\u2019s second-largest economy.

[Wednesday] might show a clearer picture.\u201d China\u2019s latest stock market upset has added to wider concerns about the state of the Chinese economy and helped send the prices of commodities such as oil and copper tumbling. Prices for copper, of which China is the world\u2019s biggest consumer, fell to a six-year low on Monday. However, it staged a slight revival on Tuesday, with benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange rising 2.2% to close at $5,300 a tonne . Gold also edged up but was not far off five-and-a-half-year lows hit last week in heavy selling as investors moved out of the precious metal. While viewed as a safe asset in uncertain times, gold does not pay interest or a dividend and so is losing its shine as expectations of a interest rate hike in the US intensify. Analysts pointed to the volatility in China, the world\u2019s top energy consumer, for oil\u2019s tumble to six-month lows early on Tuesday. Brent crude prices managed to rebound later on but were still below $54 a barrel, having halved in price over the last year. Among emerging-market currencies, Malaysia\u2019s ringgit and Thailand\u2019s baht both hovered around multi-year lows against the dollar as the hot money that poured into developing economies during the years of ultra-loose US monetary policy began to flow back out. Market experts see no let-up in the selling pressure on emerging-market assets, with currencies particularly vulnerable. \u201cEmerging currencies have been in a bear market since 2013 and prospects for a sustained recovery look poor. With emerging-market growth slipping to its weakest level since 2009, foreign capital inflows have been dwindling. Meanwhile, China\u2019s slowdown is contributing to slow world trade growth and continued downward pressure on commodity prices, hitting emerging markets\u2019 terms of trade,\u201d said Adam Slater at the consultancy Oxford Economics. Before the markets opening on Tuesday, Beijing vowed to press on with efforts to tame China\u2019s volatile stock market and prevent further panic. A state-controlled stock-buying agency would \u201ccontinue to buy stocks to stabilise the market\u201d, said Zhang Xiaojun, at China\u2019s securities regulator, the CSRC.

We are going to essentially triumph over market forces.\u2019\u201d But, he said, that strategy carried serious risks for China\u2019s Communist party leaders. \u201cRule number one is: you don\u2019t want to promise the unachievable. The answer is: let the market find its level \u2013 I don\u2019t see why they didn\u2019t do that in the first place. In 2007, the market collapsed by 70% and it didn\u2019t derail the Chinese economy.\u201d   Related: China stock market hit by biggest one-day fall since 2007    Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets, said Monday\u2019s rout appeared to have been caused by Beijing withdrawing the support it had been pumping into the stock market after June\u2019s collapse in which $3tn (\u00a31.9tn) was wiped off the value of listed companies.  That move was likely to have been executed \u201ceither to test the waters to see whether the market could withstand their absence or potentially even to try and scale back on things\u201d, Spooner said. \u201cIt appears that that didn\u2019t work.\u201d Beijing has taken unprecedented steps to stave off the threat of a more severe stock market collapse in recent weeks including freezing flotations and using a state-run \u201cstabilisation fund\u201d to pump billions of dollars into the market.  But analysts warn that while such interventions might work in the short term, in the longer term they would fail. \u201cTo some extent these \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 initiatives can actually make these things a bit worse since they make things opaque, they mean that people become nervous,\u201d said Spooner. \u201cThe very fact that the authorities are acting to do things to shore the market up creates a nervousness and it is difficult for people to know where the real value is.\u201d Chovanec said: \u201cThe chronic issue in China is that they want a correction without having a correction.

In London, the FTSE 100 index also closed up 1.2% at 6,631.  However, some analysts also fear the bursting of the Chinese stock market bubble in recent weeks may augur a downturn in the wider economy. Chinese GDP growth has slowed from the double-digit annual rates seen in the runup to the global financial crisis. This follows a deliberate shift by the authorities from export-dependent growth to stronger domestic consumption. The latest official figures showed annual growth of 7% \u2013 in line with Beijing\u2019s target \u2013 but analysts at City consultancy Fathom say their calculations, based on measures including electricity use and bank lending, suggest the true rate is less than half that. Fathom\u2019s Laura Eaton said Beijing may eventually be forced to engineer a sharp depreciation in the yuan in order to restore competitiveness and increase growth. \u201cAs China tries out the full range of its policy levers, we believe that eventually it will resort to exchange-rate depreciation,\u201d she said.  Salman Ahmed, of asset manager Lombard Odier, said China\u2019s vast $4tn (\u00a32.6tn) foreign currency reserves meant it had considerable capacity to continue underpinning financial markets, but that the volatility of recent weeks would still hit economic growth. \u201cGrowth is likely to take a further blow as both wealth effects and sentiment, hit as a result of equity market volatility, pass through the system,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready the heavy falls in commodities show that this dynamic has accelerated and, more importantly, is likely to remain with us going forward.\u201d There have also been growing questions about whether such direct intervention in financial markets undermines China\u2019s attempt to prove its credentials as a fully fledged, free market economy. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve done have been, to a degree, irrational,\u201d said Sat Duhra, fund manager at Henderson Global Investors. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that if China does want to be seen as a credible destination for foreign capital, then some of these things have to be more measured and thought out.\u201d", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Chinese economy", "China", "Business", "Shares", "Money", "Global economy", "Asia Pacific", "Economics", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-29T18:39:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/30/mel-gibson-war-drama-hacksaw-ridge-to-begin-filming-in-nsw-in-october", "sentences": ["Variety reported Shi Jianxiang, founder and CEO of Shanghai Kuailu Investment Group, the company funding the US$65m project, said at the announcement: \u201cMel is interested in what happened during that period of time, and provided relevant suggestions on how to make the movie.\u201d  Hacksaw Ridge will be Gibson\u2019s fifth directorial outing, after Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ, Braveheart and The Man Without a Face."], "title": "Mel Gibson war drama Hacksaw Ridge to begin filming in NSW in September", "article": "Mel Gibson will make his directorial comeback with second world war drama Hacksaw Ridge, which begins shooting in New South Wales in September.

This three-part series sweeps the Atlantic from Arctic to Antarctic, and while beholden to the self-created cliches of BBC nature programming (stirring orchestral accompaniments, portentous narration, delivered here by Cillian Murphy), the photography is reliably astonishing. This episode follows the Gulf Stream across the Atlantic\u2019s north, tracking whales, turtles and trawler boats. Andrew Mueller Prince Philip: The Plot to Make a King9pm, Channel 4 Before finding his place in public life as a generator of gaffes, Prince Philip was seen as a threat by the British establishment. In the wake of the Nazi salute story, this doc heaps more scrutiny on the royals. It looks at how, when he first fell in love with the Queen, the Windsors were put out by Philip\u2019s Nazi connections: his brother-in-law was an SS colonel. Also of some concern was his ambitious uncle, Lord Mountbatten, who had allegedly been plotting a marriage between Philip and Elizabeth since she was 13.

As cameras move in for a new three-parter, we observe the familiar rites and rhythms of campus life: student elections, nights out and febrile romance. These experiences come within reach only after a lot of hard work from carers, parents and the students themselves.

On one side there are the individual investors, who are in the midst of what may be the greatest wave of panic-driven selling we\u2019ve witnessed since Black Tuesday, when billions of dollars were lost in a single day of trading on the New York stock exchange. On the other side: the Chinese government. Worryingly, there\u2019s some evidence that the rest of us are stuck in the middle. The average Chinese investor had been all too eager to participate in the speculative frenzy that sent the Shanghai Composite Index from only 2,000 points in July 2014 to a peak of 5,200 a little more than a month ago, responding to hints from government officials that stocks were cheap. But financial literacy is largely Awol in mainland China, and what passes for \u201cinvesting\u201d usually involves rapid-fire trading based on tips or rumors, rather than long-term asset allocation and strategic decisions. Forget financial literacy \u2013 nearly 6% of new investors\u2019 households weren\u2019t literate by any measure, according to one survey.  While we tend to be driven by short-term considerations too, these Chinese speculators make the typical US investor look like Warren Buffett. Given the size of China\u2019s population, that wave of speculation is enormous \u2013 as many as 800,000 new trading accounts could be opened in a single day, while over the course of the past year the stock market created $6.5tn in paper wealth, sending valuations to fresh highs even as the economy stumbled. That of course is why, when \u2013 as happens with all bubbles \u2013 something happened to make someone pause and say \u201cWait a second, this is absurd\u201d and start to sell, the fallout was equally violent: a decline of 8%, of 14%; a string of losses that so far has caused some $4tn in market value to simply evaporate in less than a month. Enter the Chinese government. China\u2019s communist leaders declared back in the 1980s that \u201cto get rich is glorious\u201d and set the country on a path leading away from a managed economy. The fairly explicit quid pro quo for a lack of democracy is that the single-party system will ensure that China remains prosperous. Now that an estimated 90 million Chinese citizens probably are sitting on outsize portfolio losses, the selloff presents a direct challenge to the leadership of China, President Xi Jinping and his colleagues. Unsurprisingly, they have combatted the selloff ferociously. Short selling? Limited, as the state press hints that it\u2019s unpatriotic. The main pension fund for the country\u2019s civil servants will invest 30% of its assets, or $145bn, in stocks. The Shanghai and Shenzhen cut trading fees by 30% to try to prevent any slump in trading activity that might follow the losses. The government has launched a $120bn market stabilization fund, suspended IPOs (in case there is too little demand and the deals fail, further damaging confidence in the markets), and has banned insiders like CEOs and board members from selling stock in their companies for at least the next six months. China\u2019s sovereign wealth funds are emerging as big buyers. Now the two sides are staring each other down \u2013 and there is no guarantee that the government will manage to prevent further bloodshed. Indeed, there\u2019s the likelihood that we will see more days like Monday in which the Chinese market nosedives, causing other global markets to follow suit. It\u2019s only logical: after all, the Shanghai composite index may have had its biggest one-day loss in more than eight years this week, but it\u2019s still trading at 3,789, well above the 2,000 or so where it was a year ago. There are plenty of profits left to vanish in another wave of selling, and a manipulated market isn\u2019t likely to instill long-term confidence in investors. Allowing investors to take out housing loans to purchase stocks isn\u2019t exactly something that is going to encourage prudent, responsible financial decisions \u2013 but that\u2019s just what the Chinese government is doing, as part of its efforts to halt the short-term carnage. All this will be painful to watch, especially if you happen to have allocated a quarter of your retirement funds to a China exchange-traded fund, or you happen to be one of those folks who gets nervous whenever the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average embark on another terror ride.  There are plenty of pundits taking to the airwaves to tell us why we don\u2019t need to worry about the giant game of high-stakes chicken under way in China\u2019s stock market right now, but I\u2019m not convinced by their optimistic \u201cdon\u2019t worry, be happy\u201d perspective.  The optimists argue that while China\u2019s economy accounts for about 16% of global GDP, its stock market is relatively insignificant, being only about the size of that of Japan. Most American investors don\u2019t have much direct exposure to Chinese stocks in their portfolios. So far, so good.  But that\u2019s the tip of a very, very large iceberg. There are many more ways in which what\u2019s happening in China today could affect our financial futures for years to come, given the importance of the country in the global economy. Consider, for a moment, that events in China have already sent investors fleeing to bonds as a safe haven once more. Looming on the horizon is the September meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers, at which point Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, and her colleagues will consider raising interest rates for the first time since before the 2008 financial crisis. It\u2019s at least conceivable that the uncertainty triggered by events in China will cause them to once again delay the inevitable rate hike.  Then there is the commodities market, where China has long reigned supreme. To the extent that China\u2019s stock market woes reflect (or trigger) problems in the country\u2019s economy, that\u2019s going to put even more downward pressure on the already-struggling prices of crude oil and base metals, like copper. That\u2019s already happening, and weighing on the economic outlook for resource-rich nations like Australia. Then there are the US companies that in recent years have made a bigger effort to penetrate China\u2019s domestic market. Fast-food chains like McDonald\u2019s and Yum! Brands\u2019 KFC are only the most visible of those pursuing Chinese consumers \u2013 but if those consumers are hit by a massive stock market selloff and don\u2019t have the money to spend on treats like pizza or burgers, look for sales to fall. At the other end of the spectrum, the Chinese are massive consumers of luxury brands.  The impact isn\u2019t confined to what happens within China. The Chinese are big travellers and outspent those from anywhere else when visiting top US destinations like New York and Los Angeles. They also buoy property values overseas, snapping up both commercial and residential properties \u2013 and it\u2019s a fairly safe bet that some of the wealth fuelling those purchases has come from stock market gains.  Then there is the long-term fallout on the economy. At the very least, a slump in the amount of activity in the financial services industry will take a toll on the pace of economic growth: depending on who you believe, financial services contributes between 1 and 1.5 percentage points to China\u2019s 7% growth rate. There\u2019s also the uncertainty of what happens next, following such massive intervention on the part of the government to prop up stock market valuations at high levels \u2013 does it lead to less foreign investment, entrepreneurship and innovation, as confidence that the government won\u2019t intervene if it doesn\u2019t like the outcome dwindles?  We\u2019re lucky. We are \u2013 or should be \u2013 more financially literate than our Chinese counterparts.

Despite policymakers\u2019 pledges to underpin the flagging Chinese economy and a further crackdown by the markets watchdog, stocks fell further on Friday and posted their biggest monthly loss in almost six years. The Shanghai composite index lost 10% this week alone and was down more than 14% for the whole of July. That extends the sharp sell-off that began in China\u2019s stock market in mid-June, a rout that has prompted the country\u2019s securities regulator to warn of \u201cpanic sentiment\u201d gripping investors, many of whom are individuals that have borrowed heavily to play the stock market. The backdrop to the heavy selling on Chinese stock markets, which are still up about 13% from the start of the year, is an economy that appears to be losing steam.   Related: China's leaders hamstring its investors as the speculative frenzy continues    Warning signs such as softer imports and exports have fanned fears of falling demand for raw materials in the world\u2019s second largest economy and rocked commodity markets. Industrial metals like copper and aluminium have been particularly hard hit, falling to multi-year lows. The gold price has been buffeted by rising prospects of an interest rate hike from the US Federal Reserve, which would make gold less attractive to investors because it does not offer a yield. Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets, sought to sum up a month that has also seen oil prices fall further, but European stock markets eke out modest gains on hopes a stopgap solution has been found to Greece\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cIt is the last day of what has been a crazy month in financial markets. July was the worst month on China\u2019s benchmark stock index in six years, gold had its largest monthly decline since 2013 but stocks have pulled back from Greece-induced losses in June,\u201d he said. Despite the sharp falls of recent weeks, fears linger over the frothy nature of China\u2019s stock market, which surged more than 150% in the 12 months leading up to June\u2019s turning point. Traders are braced for more swings to come, and economists expect further announcements from the authorities in Beijing as they seek to restore confidence. The country\u2019s securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said on Friday it was probing the impact of automated trading on stock markets. It was the latest in a series of moves aimed at steadying markets by curbing what officials see as speculative selling. Because so many of the investors in the market are individuals, there are fears that deepening losses risk denting the real economy and even fuelling social unrest. But financial market experts have questioned how much officials can do to calm the volatility, after efforts that have included extending government-backed loans to investors in order to buy shares. Analysts at Fathom Consulting said the latest signs were not encouraging. \u201cFurther falls in Chinese equity indices this week, in the face of substantial official intervention, suggests that policymakers in that country are not as omnipotent as many seem to assume,\u201d they wrote in a research note.", "tags": ["China", "Stock markets", "Business", "Global economy", "Asia Pacific", "Economics", "World news", "Chinese economy"], "publicationDate": "2015-07-31T17:45:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/01/china-stockmarket-crisis-investors", "sentences": ["That\u2019s the message from financial advisers following the crash in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in China in recent weeks."], "title": "China\u2019s stock market crisis: what does it mean for investors?", "article": "Don\u2019t panic!

Funds invested in global emerging markets \u2013 including Russia, Brazil and India as well as China \u2013 have lost around 10% in value over the past year, and are now the worst-performing of all fund types. Concerns are growing that the Chinese economy is cooling fast, and along with it the prices China will pay for the resources it buys from the rest of the world (particularly Brazil).

In China, the Shanghai Composite Index lost more than 8% of its value last Monday, and shares have suffered their worst month for six years, falling by 29% since they peaked in June. America\u2019s great crash, and the policy failures that compounded its effects, helped to trigger the great depression. Partly because of the lessons learned then and since, few analysts believe China is heading for an economic downturn on that scale. But there are growing concerns about what the stock price rollercoaster reveals about the health of the world\u2019s second largest economy. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, played it cool when asked about the Chinese market gyrations in a press conference on Wednesday. She pointed out that the market was still up an extraordinary 80% over the past year, and added she was not surprised the government in Beijing was intervening to prevent the \u201cdisorderly functioning\u201d of markets. \u201cThat is the duty of central authorities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that they want to maintain a level of liquidity that is commensurate with an orderly process is quite good.\u201d In other words, while some have condemned Beijing\u2019s efforts to arrest the share slide as clunky and authoritarian, Lagarde saw it as little different to the scramble by western governments during the 2008 crisis to prevent their financial systems from seizing up. She was relaxed, too, about the potential impact of the share price slide on China\u2019s real economy \u2013 the shops, factories and farms that create jobs and generate growth. \u201cWe believe that the Chinese economy is resilient and strong enough to withstand that kind of significant variation in the markets,\u201d she said. Yet many analysts believe that as well as the bursting of a financial bubble, the downturn in the stock market reflects a wider economic slowdown. Robert Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton, who now works at US consultancy Sonecon, says: \u201cThe Chinese leadership have had a fundamental policy of driving growth sufficiently great to generate employment for about 10 million people a year. The main way they\u2019ve done this is through public investment, or semi-public investment. A lot of these projects are now going bust, because there\u2019s nobody to purchase the apartments, and there are no businesses to rent the offices.\u201d He says the market chaos is partly a direct result of this phenomenon, as shares in construction and property firms are hit. The investment slowdown is a part of a deliberate and carefully signalled policy by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to shift growth away from the export-dominated model that brought more than a decade of double-digit growth rates, as China exploited cheap labour to become the undisputed workshop of the world. Instead, Beijing hopes to achieve the next stage of economic development through more sustainable, domestic-led growth, encouraging urbanisation, and increasing the role of markets. Opening up its stock markets to overseas investors \u2013 albeit via intermediaries in Hong Kong \u2013 was one step in that process. Extraordinary strides have been made in tackling urban poverty, and tax cuts have helped to cut the cost of imported goods, but the continued weakness of retail sales has undermined hopes that an army of new consumers would power the economy forward. And Shapiro argues that China will also have to face up to the legacy of the lending boom that has been key to keeping the economy afloat. \u201cThere are huge volumes of bad debts,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that the distortions in the Chinese economy have accumulated, and there is a growing probability of a hard landing.\u201d Officially, Chinese GDP is still expanding at a healthy rate, in line with the government\u2019s target of 7% a year \u2013 which would already be the slowest pace since 1990. But there are questions about the reliability of official figures. China-watchers at City consultancy Fathom compile their own \u201cChina momentum index\u201d, based on a number of metrics, including electricity usage and industrial production, and they argue that growth has slowed sharply, to perhaps 3%. Certainly, interest rates have been cut repeatedly in a bid to put a floor under the markets, but also to underpin growth. \u201cAlthough policymakers are reluctant to admit that China has slowed dramatically, the recent onslaught of measures aimed at stimulating the economy surely hints at their discomfort,\u201d says Fathom\u2019s Laura Eaton. \u201cWhile these measures may temporarily alleviate the downward pressure, they do very little to resolve China\u2019s longstanding problems of excess capacity, non-performing loans and perennially weak household consumption.\u201d Recent sharp declines in global commodity prices, including oil, copper and iron ore, are regarded by many market-watchers as resulting from weak Chinese demand, as its apparently insatiable appetite for the world\u2019s natural resources wanes. A downturn in global trade volumes, too, while it has many disparate causes, can probably also be laid partly at China\u2019s door. The country\u2019s slowdown is unfolding at a fragile moment for the global economy, with the eurozone crisis far from resolved and the Federal Reserve preparing to increase interest rates for the first time since the global financial crisis.     Shanghai shopping: many browsers, few buyers. Photograph: Carlos Barria / Reuters/Reuters    Professor Danny Quah, an expert on China at the London School of Economics, says: \u201cThe US tightening monetary policy amid fragility in the world economy more generally will be challenging for China. Domestic circumstances are tough as well: significant local government debt and already relatively high real wages with thin profit margins remain worries for the economy overall within China.\u201d But he insists that with $4 trillion (\u00a32.6tn) worth of foreign currency reserves and interest rates still above 4% \u2013 instead of at rock bottom, as in the US, UK, eurozone and Japan \u2013 Beijing is far from impotent in the face of crisis. \u201cI suspect China\u2019s policymakers have plenty of firepower still to help support economic growth in the short term \u2013 for the next five years certainly 7% a year would be manageable,\u201d he says. But to the extent that Chinese policymakers are forced to dip into their foreign currency war chest to support growth \u2013 and particularly if a less export-oriented growth strategy means that it stops racking up the vast trade surpluses that have helped it to accumulate these huge reserves \u2013 the ripples will be felt in markets around the world. Simon Derrick, head of market strategy at investment firm BNY Mellon, says there are signs that is already happening. He says reserves have already been trimmed by about 7.5%, from just under $4tn at the end of June 2014, to $3.69tn by the end of June this year. Along with other emerging economies that piled up reserves to avoid a repeat of the late 1990s Asian financial crisis, China\u2019s massive buying power in debt markets was one of the pressures keeping interest rates low across the developed world in the runup to 2008. Derrick believes this shift away from accumulating new reserves could have contributed to the drift upwards in US bond yields, and the downward pressure on a slew of currencies in recent months, including the euro, and the Canadian and Australian dollars. \u201cSuddenly, you don\u2019t have the same support that you\u2019ve had for the past 15 years, which is why you\u2019ve seen so much volatility,\u201d he says. And as the Fed prepares the ground for a rate rise, Derrick argues that the absence of Chinese buying power in financial markets could mean the impact of that decision is amplified, with borrowing costs rising steeply in the US and emerging markets. \u201cIf there is to be a move higher in interest rates across the board, maybe it will be sharper than perhaps you might have expected maybe five years ago.\u201d Other countries have ample low-cost labour ready to move into manufacturing as Chinese real wages rise, so it may be through higher borrowing costs, rather than a dearth of cheap toys or T-shirts, where the west will feel the impact of China\u2019s changing economy most keenly. In Shanghai, meanwhile, the luckless citizens who chose to invest their hard-earned cash in shares are learning the hard lesson \u2013 often forgotten even by the world\u2019s most seasoned investors \u2013 that markets can go down as well as up. Global powerhouse with a poverty challenge ENGINE OF GROWTH \u2026 China is the world\u2019s second-biggest economy behind the US, but in terms of who powers growth in the global economy, China is way out ahead. The country has contributed more than a third of global economic growth since 2008-09, so even a moderate slowdown has the potential to send shockwaves around the world. \u2026 BUT STILL DEVELOPING Despite its rapid growth, and predictions that it could even overtake the United States over the coming year, China remains, in the assessment of the World Bank, a developing country. Per-capita income is still a fraction of that in advanced countries. With the second largest number of poor in the world after India, poverty reduction remains a fundamental challenge for China, the World Bank adds. COMMODITIES Fast-industrialising China has a huge and rising influence on commodity markets. It accounts for roughly half the global demand for nickel, aluminium and copper. So when China slows, commodity prices are hit, mining company shares tumble and the pain is felt in the biggest commodity exporters, such as Australia. China makes up almost a third of Australia\u2019s exports. ENERGY With its population of around 1.3 billion, China is also the world\u2019s largest consumer of energy, and recent trade figures suggest it is overtaking the US as the biggest importer of crude oil. The majority of its electricity comes from coal but it is also the biggest producer of wind power: and its capacity to generate hydroelectric power dwarfs other countries thanks to plants like the Three Gorges Dam. STEEL OUTPUT China is the world\u2019s biggest steel producer, making more than 822m tonnes last year, which was half of global output, according to the World Steel Association. China is also far and away the biggest consumer, taking about 46% of finished steel products in 2014, the association says. LUXURY MARKET An expanding middle class has boosted demand for consumer goods in China and by Chinese tourists on overseas shopping sprees in the US and Europe. It is already the world\u2019s largest car market and accounts for about a third of global smartphone sales.

For my father it was a daily conversation in my teens and early 20s and even though I very profoundly understood his pain, one day I had to say to him, \u2018Dad, I can\u2019t talk about this anymore.\u2019 My father had a whole wall of books on the subject of the Holocaust \u2013 it was all he wanted to talk about, but it was so harrowing for me.\u201d Glass began speaking to other children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, initially for an academic thesis, then later as part of the group he founded Never Ever Again!, a reference to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights pledge. He said he soon realised he was not alone in being scarred by the traumatic pasts of his relatives. \u201cI have been privileged to hear so many stories from young people who should now be able to live with joy \u2013 but their lives are damaged and they weren\u2019t even there,\u201d he said.     Dan Glass (right) with his sister Naomi, grandmother Herti and uncle. Photograph: Dan Glass    Glass adds that other grandchildren of survivors have experienced clinical depression, anxiety, addiction and eating disorders, which they blame on the impact of their families constantly retelling stories of the horrific events their relatives endured. Ken Feinstein, a second generation family member, whose parents were Holocaust survivors and who grew up in Boston, Lincolnshire, told of how his school teacher, who also survived, insisted children as young as eight watched documentaries on the subject. \u201cWhen kids would look away from it she would yell at them, \u2018You have no right to do that. I buried my family.\u2019 We must have been about seven or eight years old. How do you prepare children of this age for something like that? They just showed it to us and kind of traumatised us. It was definitely meant to shock us into never forgetting,\u201d said Feinstein.   Related: My grandparents rejected the Holocaust survivor label. They weren't alone | Yuliya Komska    A young woman from London told Glass of how her grandmother, who was in the Dutch resistance, avoided starvation at times by digging up flower bulbs and sucking out the nutrients. The woman later developed anorexia and believes it was related to the war stories that had been passed down the line and never processed. Trauma research about the impact of the Holocaust on subsequent generations varies; some studies conclude there is no effect of trauma two generations on, while others claim that breast milk of survivors was affected by stress hormones that impacted on the physiology of the next generation. Some in the field of epigenetics say the intergenerational effects of the Holocaust are very pronounced and that the atrocities altered the DNA of victims\u2019 descendants, so that they have different stress hormone profiles to their peers.  Psychologist Ruth Barnett, whose Jewish father fled Germany for Shanghai, narrowly escaping the Holocaust, says she has witnessed inherited trauma in some of her clients.  \u201cConstantly talking about events like the gas chambers to grandchildren is a way that traumatised people try to get rid of it \u2013 by sicking it up. But unless it is processed properly, they make even more anxiety for themselves and other generations.\u201d    Our grandparents went through one horror, but it is important that we learn to debrief to bring about wholesale recovery  Dan Glass     Never Ever Again! wants to move from what it calls \u201cmelancholic memorialisation\u201d to \u201cpositive action\u201d, and is calling for mental health provision to treat inherited trauma, as well as campaigning on various issues, including increased surveillance of fascist groups across Europe, supporting the Human Rights Act and challenging anti-immigration legislation. Glass says that while it is essential to preserve historical facts, the traumatising effect of memory should be addressed now. \u201cOur grandparents went through one horror, but it is important that we learn to process and debrief from their story to bring about wholesale recovery for this generation and the next. \u201cWe should be releasing these old wounds to something beautiful rather than staying paralysed in memory and fear. Until then we cannot properly celebrate their lives or any kind of victory. \u201cWhat would our grandparents have felt if they had known we have had to carry their torment through generations?

Vaile is also chairman of the company. Soon after it won government in 2007, Labor came under intense pressure over free travel that senior figures \u2013 including Burke and the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd \u2013 had accepted from companies associated with Tang and other Chinese business figures while in opposition. From 10-17 October last year, Kazaru Pty, a company owned by the lobbyist and former Labor minister Nick Bolkus, paid for a trip by Burke to Beijing and Shanghai including airfares, accommodation and ground transport. Guardian Australia understands the trip was for Burke to open a 123 AustChina centre. From 6-13 July this year Kazaru paid for Burke to travel to China again, but this time transfers and accommodation were provided by 123 childcare.

A documentary comparing Chinese and British teachers in a Hampshire school will show Chinese teachers appalled at how disruptive, challenging and idle British pupils could be. That, by implication, is why Chinese children do better, far better, in international tests. All this tells us about is tests. Only exam salesmen and Whitehall officials believe this has anything to do with education. The OECD/Pisa global league tables in maths have long been discredited, most recently by the Chinese educationist, Yong Zhao. It turns out they compared results for all British and American 15-year-olds with a few highly corrupt \u201ctesting factories\u201d in China\u2019s richest city, Shanghai, and other urban communities in Hong Kong and Singapore. Like was in no way compared with like. In addition, the most publicised scores related to one subject, maths, for the obvious reason that maths could most easily be rote-learned and recorded. The fiasco was a classic of making what is measurable important, rather than what might be important measurable. Yet the BBC and the government still churn out the Pisa figures. We have no knowledge of how well these children do later, the extent to which they lead busier, richer, happier, safer, more fulfilled lives. The scorers are not paid to care. What we do know is that America and Britain, after half a century of consistent poor performance in these league tables, have led the world in academic research, scientific patents, invention, innovation, prosperity, creativity, power and, to those for whom it matters, democratic vitality. It seems plain to me that Chinese education, like Russian education, is good at making communist automatons. Why does that so appeal to British ministers? The irony is that, as Zhao writes, the Chinese are rushing in the opposite direction. They want to know why their pupils may be good at rote learning yet seem so enervated thereafter. Chinese parents crave the British private schools being set up across China. Chinese students cram into US and British universities. They can see that a dragooned, mechanically competitive schooling is no path to creativity, challenge or happiness in the long run in a dynamic economy and a critical open society. Basing education on testing is as mindless today as when Dickens ridiculed it in Hard Times. Yet its appeal to British governments \u2013 from the days of Lord Baker to those of Michael Gove \u2013 is relentless. The reason is simple: it holds the easiest means of central control.

Hailiang also paid $10m for another cattle and cropping property nearby. It was hardly a \u201cmega-deal\u201d by corporate standards but one of the biggest involving Chinese in the Australian farming sector over the previous year. Then it was eclipsed last month by the $47m sale of 700,000 hectares of grazing land traversing the Queensland and Northern Territory border to the ballbearing billionaire Xingfa Ma.       That deal could also be eclipsed within the next year if one of China\u2019s largest beef producers, Chongqing Hondo Agriculture Group, follows through on a plan to plunge up to $100m into farmland and slaughterhouses. \u201cI like Australia because there are big farms and we are wanting to increase our consistency of supply,\u201d the company\u2019s president, Qin Ya Liang, told Fairfax Media at a trade seminar in Brisbane in May. The \u201cbigger size is good\u201d but the company was willing to take shares in smaller enterprises as well, he said. But all of these stand to be dwarfed by the upcoming sale of S Kidman and Co, the country\u2019s biggest beef empire covering more than 100,000 square kilometres, which is on the market for more than $325m.    They\u2019re going to buy up our dairy farms and buy up our beef farms  Alan Jones, broadcaster     Two Chinese players are thought to be on the shortlist of bidders: the conglomerate Ningbo Xianfeng New Material and the Rifa group, a textile machinery enterprise formerly owned by the Chinese government. Last year Rifa spent $37m on sheep properties in Victoria. If either company prevails, it would be the biggest chunk of Australian farmland acquired by Chinese \u2013 or anyone else so far. In June, the prospect of Australia\u2019s largest private landholding passing into foreign, perhaps even Chinese hands, was the catalyst for a rallying cry by the federal agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. It was reported at the time that several foreign state-owned enterprises were weighing up bids for the cattle empire. Joyce spoke strongly in support of a NSW National party conference motion opposing the sale of Kidman to any such state interest. \u201cIt\u2019s different when it is a genuine foreign company or individual investing; they will make their decisions whether to buy land and then stay in [Australian] agriculture or not based on the returns they earn,\u201d Joyce told the conference. \u201cBut a foreign government has a more long-term purpose [in buying farms], which could over the long run undermine our nation\u2019s interests.\u201d Two months on, it is not clear what foreign state-owned enterprise was exercising the minds of Joyce and the Nationals, beyond suspicions about Rifa\u2019s origins and the fact another possible bidder is backed by Canada\u2019s public-sector pension fund.   Related: How much of Australia\u2019s farmland is owned by foreign companies?    But the episode highlighted concerns about the strategies of foreign companies buying Australian farmland \u2013 notwithstanding Joyce\u2019s attempt to pre-empt accusations of xenophobia by distinguishing between private- and state-owned foreign buyers. This was a distinction that eluded the broadcaster Alan Jones on Wednesday when he was accused by an Abbott government minister of running a \u201cracist\u201d scare campaign about foreign ownership of Australian farmland. Jones repeatedly raised concerns about not just Chinese but also Japanese and Korean interests. He said China and Japan \u201cwon\u2019t need our exports [because] they\u2019re going to buy up our dairy farms and buy up our beef farms\u201d. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, insisted only 1% of agriculture was owned by the Chinese \u201cand yet most people would think it\u2019s probably 20% \u2026 with all of the ranting by the unions and everyone else\u201d. Beyond talkback radio, there are suspicions that the Chinese at least, who are short of water and land, are playing a government-inspired long game to ensure \u201cfood security\u201d \u2013 to the possible detriment of Australia\u2019s interests.

Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    The arrival of the Chinese as serious buyers into Australian agriculture coincides with the Abbott government dramatically raising the scrutiny of their farmland purchases. It has slashed the threshold for Foreign Investment Review Board screening of agricultural land acquisitions by Chinese from $248m to $15m, which has focused new attention even on deals at the modest end of this space. The government has also tasked the tax office with collecting all data on foreign ownership of farmland, with a view to compiling a register next year. These moves come well on the heels of Europeans, Americans, Japanese and Koreans acquiring great swaths of Australian agriculture.   Related: China and Australia formally sign free trade agreement    They offer a potentially mixed message at a time when a new free trade deal between China and Australia has eased the passage of Australian farm products into the Chinese market by lifting tariffs, as well as easing Foreign Investment Review Board scrutiny of Chinese acquisitions in \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d sectors. Part of the sensitivity around Chinese acquiring farmland in Australia is the perception that companies acting overseas are an extension of Chinese government imperatives. Tim Buckley, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says the posture of many Chinese companies can be explicitly linked to a Chinese government mandate to expand their global footprint. The annual report of the Chinese coalminer Shenhua, for one, makes this clear, he says. Buckley says the same strategic concerns in agriculture would be at play whether it is a state-owned or private enterprise: a combination of profit-seeking vertical integration, the desire for long-term food security and the simple desire to project power.    These are simply highly entrepreneurial people that want to diversify their capital  Doug Ferguson, China expert     \u201cIt does not surprise me at all the Chinese are busy buying up land in Australia,\u201d Buckley says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost inevitable because they\u2019re short water and they\u2019re short land, and the one thing we do know is the richer they get the more protein they want. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just strategic vertical integration food security. It\u2019s projecting power, going beyond the borders of China.\u201d In contrast to the attention the Chinese receive, Buckley says \u201cno one blinked an eyelid\u201d when James Packer unloaded his massive cattle interests to the British private equity firm Terra Firma for a reported $400m-plus in 2009.Terra Firma is also said to be eyeing a bid for the Kidman empire. Despite the ongoing series of multimillion-dollar deals capturing headlines, farmland purchases in fact represent a tiny proportion of Chinese investment in Australia. Chinese companies have invested less than $2bn in total on Australian farms or agricultural businesses, according to research by the accounting firm KPMG and the University of Sydney\u2019s China studies centre, one of the few sources of detailed information on Chinese investment. Almost a third of this comes from a single \u201cmega-deal\u201d involving a Chinese state-owned enterprise, Bright Food, which paid $550m for a 75% stake in Manassen Foods in 2011.  By contrast, Chinese invested $4.3bn in commercial real estate in Australia last year alone.  About 12.5% of Australian farmland was at least partly owned by foreign investors as of mid-2013, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The bureau has not published data to show what proportion belongs to Chinese interests. KPMG\u2019s Doug Ferguson, the lead author of the report Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia\u201d, says the Chinese share is \u201cdefinitely\u201d negligible.       According to figures from the Foreign Investment Review Board for 2013-14, China was the largest foreign investor in the category of agriculture, forestry and fishing with $632m in total (combining figures for Hong Kong and China, which the board lists separately). Canada and the US were a close second and third, with $602m and $584m respectively. In the previous year, investment from the US eclipsed all other countries at $880m.  According to KPMG the narrower category of farmland and agribusiness deals account for less than 1% of total Chinese investment in Australia in 2014, being worth $140m. But Ferguson says 2015 looms as a potential \u201cbreakthrough\u201d year for such deals, bringing their share to more than 1%. This is still a far cry from even the fading mining sector and hinges on the outcome a number of cattle station deals involving Chinese.    Growing agricultural and business ties will deliver huge benefits to both countries and peoples  Chinese embassy spokeswoman     A spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy in Canberra says the two countries, both major agricultural producers, are \u201chighly complementary in terms of land resources, capital, technology, labour, industrial structure and market\u201d.  \u201cGrowing agricultural and business ties will deliver huge benefits to both countries and peoples,\u201d she says, adding that China has been Australia\u2019s largest trading partner in farm produce since 2010-11. \u201cThe two countries have carried out fruitful agricultural cooperation thanks to the great efforts made by the two governments,\u201d she says, adding that the free trade agreement and export deal on Australian live cattle to China \u201cherald great potential and broad prospect for bilateral cooperation in a wide range of areas including beef cattle and diary\u201d. Ferguson says cattle and dairy remain the top focus for Chinese players in Australia, followed by \u201ca pretty big gap, frankly, to anything else\u201d. One key deal is the sale of a reported $40m stake by the media buyer Harold Mitchell in Yougawalla cattle station in Western Australia. But the \u201cone to watch\u201d is Kidman, according to Ferguson. Buckley says a farmland register would be \u201ca good starting point so we actually know the magnitude of the issue because at the moment, everyone\u2019s shooting blind\u201d. On the question of Chinese companies acting on the mandate of their government to spread their influence as a projection of national power, Ferguson disagrees. Of those actively seeking a foothold in Australian agriculture, Bright Foods and Cosco are the only state-owned players, with \u201cthe remainder really privately owned\u201d, he said. \u201cThese things are far more commercial, profit-driven rather than being encouraged from a government perspective,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cThese are simply highly entrepreneurial people that want to diversify their capital anyway and they want to play in the sectors that are going to enable them to not only invest more but also sell at a much higher profit margin back into the Chinese market.\u201d Ferguson also says there is a misconception the Chinese desire for \u201cfood security\u201d, or self-sufficiency in food production, is what is driving the purchase of Australian farmland.     The Fortescue Solomon iron ore mine in the Valley of the Kings. Shares in Fortescue Metals Group jumped 9% in one day this week, boosted by a report that China\u2019s Hebei Iron &amp; Steel Group and Tewoo Group could invest in its infrastructure and mining assets.  Photograph: David Gray/Reuters    \u201cThe food security thing is focused on their own production zones within China, using technology and capital to aggregate and build larger scale dairy farms and grazing companies, importing livestock, genetics, animal feeds, et cetera.  \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing in Australia is very much the focus on acquiring premium, highest quality, high-value brands that will enable a very significant mark-up or profit with the wealthiest element of Chinese society.\u201d It is not that the Australian farms hold irresistible allure for the Chinese or come without hitches, as KPMG points out. Profit margins are low, climate risks high. Most are family-owned operations that can barely touch the sides in massive Chinese supply chains. Most Chinese buyers have no experience in farming so are ill-equipped to build, piece by piece, operations of suitable size in Australia. And then there is the high level of scrutiny given to such deals by the Australian media, which Ferguson says does influence the decisions of Chinese investors. \u201cIn most cases, they\u2019re pretty hard-nosed commercial people but at the same time the Chinese clients that I speak to are sensitive around whether or not they feel welcomed, whether or not they feel as though they can actually not only buy the asset but then operate in the community,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a lot more to making a business work than just buying it.\u201d The end game for these investors is not to control Australian land but \u201cto have enough equity in the business to have a say on the direction of the offtake\u201d.  \u201cThat\u2019s what they want,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to firm up their supply chains. They can see an opportunity to go from primary production in Australia to the finished good in a supermarket in China.\u201d     Barnaby Joyce, the agricultural minister, oppose the possible sale of S Kidman and Co to a foreign state interest. Photograph: Daniel Munoz/AAP    Ferguson and Buckley agree it is the \u201cfear of the unknown\u201d that is working against the Chinese in Australian agriculture investments. Ferguson says: \u201cWe\u2019re pretty comfortable now with Japanese investors, Korean investors, Middle Eastern investors. The Chinese are new and relatively inexperienced and they come from a different political basis and a very different cultural basis. There is a lot of anxiety.\u201d Much of this anxiety will be \u201ctaken out of the equation\u201d by examples of successful joint ventures, particularly those that leave Australian managers in control of farm operations, according to Ferguson. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s a private Chinese company with clearly a profit motive,\u201d he adds. This is a nod to reservations in Australia\u2019s farming sector about the motives of Chinese state enterprise, even among those who have no concerns doing business with private Chinese players. Brian Duddy, whose family made a fortune selling land to one such player, says there persists among farmers \u201ca genuine fear about state-owned companies\u201d. He indicates this is as much a concern about the unfair competitive advantage a state-backed enterprise might enjoy, perhaps in the form of secret subsidies or tax breaks, as about national strategic interest in food supply. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve got a free trade deal, you don\u2019t know what benefits they\u2019ve got,\u201d he says. \u201cThey could be completely uncompetitive and still be there. \u201cIf there\u2019s a farmer who\u2019s competing on the same footing and they want to go and buy another property, at least if it\u2019s a private [Chinese] operator, they have to make a profit and abide by the rules that exist.\u201d  It could be that simply speaking the language of profit is the key to China\u2019s entrepreneurial class winning its social licence to operate in this new frontier.

In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 223 points, or 1.3%, in early afternoon trading. Copper prices recovered from a six year-low while oil prices edged back to $49.77. The oil price had slumped in early trading after the mixed weekend figures from China showed crude oil imports rose by 4.1% in July from June, but broader trade data revealed an 8.3% slump in exports. Fears that Chinese economic activity was slowing helped push the benchmark North Sea Brent oil down to $48.24 a barrel, its lowest level in more than six months. Analysts said they expected China\u2019s central bank to respond with a further easing of monetary policy to push down borrowing costs and the value of the currency. Wei Yao, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \u201cJudging from recent data, the economy is still under immense downward pressure.\u201d   Related: Chinese shares are falling, but the real fear is that the economy itself is slowing    She said high pork prices were a major factor squeezing disposable incomes and forcing the government to act. China produces and consumes approximately half the world\u2019s pigs. Yao said: \u201cHigher pork prices squeeze other consumption in the absence of any acceleration in income growth. Therefore, fiscal policy has to step up and monetary policy is likely to play an assisting role by providing targeted liquidity.\u201d The central bank is not likely to cut its main interest rate, but would use other, less obvious methods of easing the constraints on banks to lend, she said. China has suffered a year-long slowdown that has dragged down global growth and hit neighbouring Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea, which rely on it as the engine of the region\u2019s economic growth. Alongside the instability in the global economy wrought by the Greek debt crisis, China\u2019s economic woes have been the main drag on growth over the past year. A sharp slide in share values on the Shanghai stock market last month alarmed Chinese investors and was only prevented from turning into a rout after the central bank stepped in to impose tight trading rules. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, a market analyst at Charles Stanley, said more weak data from China could prompt the Beijing authorities to allow the currency to devalue against the dollar and the euro. He said: \u201cThe pressure is rising on China to devalue, which would support China\u2019s equity [markets].\u201d Prices of most commodities have tumbled on world markets over the past six months as traders forecast declining sales in China.

How high will it rise, and how peacefully? When China falters, the world worries. How will we manage if this mighty economy slumps, or if political control of this immense society should slip gear? Of course every big country, whether it be India, Russia, Brazil or Nigeria, generates a few such anxieties, as does the European Union, but not on the same scale. Only America has the same degree of truly global importance as China. What, for example, links the recent poor performance of Jaguar Land Rover, the halving of Tata\u2019s profits, the shrinking exports of Taiwanese phone firms, the rescue of the Ecuadorean economy after it defaulted on debts, and the fall in the price of gold last month? The answer is the state of the Chinese market, the policy choices of Chinese financial institutions, and the decisions of the\u00a0Chinese government. Those decisions have an extraordinary ripple effect across the world. What is true in economics is also true in politics and military affairs. More than 100 Chinese ships, including nuclear submarines, last month churned through the waters of the South China Sea, firing off missiles and guns and generally behaving as if there was a war on. Planes zoomed overhead. The Chinese did this in an ocean area they had unilaterally designated as off limits to foreign ships, and they did it immediately before a meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Kuala Lumpur. They took the precaution of announcing in advance that Asean was not a proper forum for the discussion of competing claims to islands in that sea, including the ones they have been artificially building up and equipping with air strips and harbours. True,\u00a0the United States and other nations also stage war games and manoeuvres in the South China Sea. But the Chinese base their naval activities on the simple proposition that it all belongs to them, that there are in reality no \u201ccompeting claims\u201d, that the clue is in the name. It says South China Sea (or \u201csouthern sea\u201d in Chinese) so that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s Chinese. It\u2019s theirs. The historical arguments that China offers in support of this are fragile, but that\u2019s not the point. The point seems to be that the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping is even more obsessed with control than its predecessors. Whether out there on the ocean sweeping aside other countries\u2019 little navies, dealing with the problems of the Shanghai stock market by pouring in state funds, or engaging with dissidents by arresting and threatening them, this is a government that seems unable to tolerate ambiguities, differences, or, in particular, even moderate opposition. Strange to recall that when Mr Xi came to\u00a0office two years ago, he was seen by some as potentially a reformer who would bring about a more relaxed China. He has done the opposite. This is a strategy that brings many dangers. Asean ministers, for example, do not accept the Chinese line. That does not mean that China won\u2019t prevail, but it probably does mean that it has permanently damaged its relations with some of its neighbours. The Shanghai stock exchange crisis, which has seen the Chinese authorities dealing with equities as if they were adversaries to be battered into submission, shows the same obtuseness in a different area. China should be accommodating itself to an era of lower growth, inevitable now that its labour is dearer, but the authorities crave the prestige of figures suggesting high growth, including stocks. So it is wasting its taxpayers\u2019 money, and eroding the rest of the world\u2019s confidence in its economic competence, by trying to keep stock prices artificially high. The worst effect of the all-encompassing obsession with control that Mr Xi has brought into Chinese politics is in human rights. The recent arrests of more than 200 human rights lawyers was not just an offence against human rights in itself, but a foolish capping of a vital safety valve for Chinese society. These lawyers would help if your house was illegally demolished, if officials ran off with village funds, if your church was harassed, or\u00a0your wages unpaid. They were irritating to the authorities but also useful, since they could signal where pressure was really building up. Otherwise, as one of them has written, \u201cSuppression of moderate dissent \u2026 could explode into massive and violent social unrest.\u201d Nobody envies the Chinese government its difficult choices.

It\u2019s his \u2013 Christian Louboutin\u2019s \u2013 secret, and why women want more and more of his shoes. They\u2019re less about going, more about coming. He has let the cameras in for the first\u00a0time, to make Christian Louboutin: The World\u2019s Most Luxurious Shoes (Channel 4). \u201cYou are going to see a documentary about someone who\u2019s been loving what he\u2019s doing, but he\u2019s doing something totally useless,\u201d he\u00a0says. \u201cIf you have no problem with\u00a0that, hello!\u201d I don\u2019t have a problem with that at all Christian, hello, yoo-hoo. So here he is, phutt-phutting through Paris on his scooter during fashion week, shadowed as always by Safquat the Bangladeshi butler. Off comes Christian\u2019s crash helmet, to be replaced by an orange beret, which just arrives through the air like a frisbee (nice catch Safquat). They probably have people with orange berets strategically positioned all over the fashionable parts of Paris just in case Christian shows up. After a quick check in the (Vespa\u2019s rear) mirror, they\u2019re into the Louis Vuitton show. Here\u2019s Catherine Deneuve \u2013 \u201cBonjour, darling\u201d (mwah, mwah). It\u2019s not just parties though. Christian has a serious empire to run; he\u2019s so busy that even a 90-minute packing date with Safquat (as in packing bags and cases, LV probably, to go away) has to be diaried in three weeks in advance. There\u2019s a man from American Vogue to see the new collection, amazing tall, spiky shoes that look like a cross between a flamingo and a triceratops. We visit his atelier, where casts of his famous clients\u2019 feet line the shelves. There\u2019s something almost sinister about them, as if they\u2019re body parts and that\u2019s all that\u2019s left \u2013 of Kylie, Kristin Scott Thomas, Tina Turner, Prince, pretty much everyone who\u2019s anyone. Oh go on, a few secrets, please, Christian? Victoria Beckham has verrucas, doesn\u2019t she? Christina Aguilera has only three toes on each foot, her father was probably a sloth \u2026 But no. Christian\u2019s a bit like a doctor, he says, and \u201ca doctor has secrets and a\u00a0doctor never speaks of his patients.\u201d Yeah, but you\u2019re not, though, are you Christian, a doctor? You make shoes. Very beautiful ones, maybe; certainly very expensive ones (from \u00a3600 to \u00a36,000 a pair), but they are still shoes. Actually not so expensive, says a woman from Shanghai in his Paris store, trying on a pair. Meaning, she\u2019s very rich; she doesn\u2019t even have any idea how many pairs she has. But these ones that she\u2019s trying aren\u2019t tall enough \u2013 she prefers 16cm heels. Why does she like them so high, filmmaker Michael Waldman asks her. \u201cEr \u2026 I think, mmm, it\u2019s a little different,\u201d she says. I don\u2019t know who she is or why she\u2019s so rich, but I don\u2019t think she made her money out of her own eloquence. Luckily for the film, Christian himself is better at talking \u2013 more entertaining and amusing; a little ridiculous, sure, as you\u2019d expect and want \u2013 but he even shows signs of a self-awareness that is rare in his world. \u201cI think I make a very useless work and I\u2019m very proud of it,\u201d he says, again. To Bhutan then \u2013 yes, the Himalayan state that has only recently opened its doors to anyone. Christian was probably the first outsider in. Well, he\u2019s friends with the Queen (of Bhutan), of course. Anyway, Christian has a team of local artisans chiselling blocks of wood into shoes. It\u2019s a long way (in every sense) from this primitive workshop high in the Himalayas to the pages of Vogue and well-heeled (in every sense) ladies wobbling about 16cm above the ground. Who, Waldman asks, does Louboutin think will be the clients of the Bhutan project? Christian gives him a look of more than faint disdain, as if he is asking Michelangelo whether he\u2019s done his market research. \u201cI have really no idea who is going to be interested \u2013 but it\u2019s a good thing because I will definitely be surprised\u201d, he says.

Schools minister Nick Gibb, who is hoping to fly out to Shanghai in February to learn more about Chinese teaching methods, described the results of the pioneering experiment as incredible, with less-able children faring particularly well. A group of secondary school teachers from a selection of English schools is preparing to travel to Shanghai next month, following an earlier visit by primary school teachers who watched Chinese teachers in action. \u201cWhen that\u2019s brought to England and the approach has been tried in English schools, it\u2019s been hugely successful,\u201d said Gibb. \u201cTeachers have been pleasantly surprised by how much some of the less-able children are achieving in maths as a consequence of this approach.\u201d Shanghai teachers use a whole-class, \u201cmastery\u201d approach, which involves teaching children of all ability every minute step of a calculation. Thirty Chinese teachers have also been flown to the UK to demonstrate their technique in English primary school classrooms. The minister described seeing a Chinese teacher in a Harris academy devote an entire lesson to how to multiply two double digit figures ending in zero. \u201cI walked around the classroom and all the children were understanding what was happening and could perform the calculation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot to learn from the approach they are taking in cities like Shanghai.

It\u2019s not string theory.\u201d The minister was speaking during a visit to the headquarters of the universities\u2019 admissions service, Ucas, on the eve of A-level national results day. In an interview with the Guardian, Gibb defended the rigour of this year\u2019s exams but confirmed he has asked DfE officials to draw up long-term plans to further reform the current system. This could include scrapping the independent exam boards which currently compete for the \u00a3300m school exams market, setting rival A-level and GCSE papers. \u201cThe idea of having a system that\u2019s pushing awarding organisations to try to compete for the schools\u2019 market share, not on the basis of price or service delivery, but sometimes on how easy it is to achieve a high grade, does seem to me to be perverse.\u201d He said both he and the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, wanted a period of stability over this parliament to allow other exam reforms to bed down, but warned that no education system in the world could remain static. \u201cWe are living in a very competitive, fast-moving global economy and for our school leavers to remain competitive in that market, we need to ensure that we are continually improving our education system.\u201d Part of that involved learning from \u201cthe best in the world\u201d, he said, in particular Shanghai, which scores top in maths in the international Pisa tests. \u201cWe don\u2019t apologise for making sure we are always monitoring best practice from around the world.\u201d The minister\u2019s comments about Chinese teaching came the day after the BBC showed the second of its TV series Are Our Kids Tough Enough? Chinese School which has shown Chinese teachers struggling to control English children, and UK teachers less than complimentary about Chinese methods. \u201cI\u2019ve recorded it. I\u2019m going to watch it at the weekend,\u201d Gibb said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s an entertainment programme. It\u2019s not a scientific study.\u201d  Early research into the effectiveness of the Shanghai mastery approach in an English context indicates a small improvement in children\u2019s maths performance, but experts say it needs to be tested over a longer period in a greater number of schools to build a more complete picture, and it has many critics inside the world of education and outside. Helpline on hand During his visit to Ucas, Gibb met members of the 40-strong team of careers advisers who will be staffing an exam results helpline that is expected to receive more than 3,000 calls on results day from those who have not gained the grades they anticipated. The government-funded phone line (0808 100 8000) opens at 8am and will continue until 24 August to cover GCSE results next Thursday, offering advice not just on university choices but also resits, remarks, apprenticeships, gap years, student finance and job options. Jenny Chung, 19, is studying international business management at Oxford Brookes University after calling the helpline last year when she got lower A-level grades than predicted. She was expecting AAB but achieved BBC and lost out on both her firm and insurance university offers. \u201cWhen I first received my results I was obviously fairly stressed and weepy, but after the tears had dried up something seemed to click in my head.\u201d She called the helpline to discuss her options and decided to apply for an alternative place through clearing, which matches unplaced applicants with suitable vacancies. \u201cHaving another perspective was an extremely vital lifeline, particularly for someone like myself who didn\u2019t want to face having to go back to my teachers, and felt too confused listening to the advice from my parents.\u201d A record one in 10 students were placed through clearing last year. Of the 30% of students who miss out on their first choice, two thirds still get a university place \u2013 half through their insurance choice and half through clearing. The minister said: \u201cIt can be a stressful time for young people, so it is vital that they can have high-quality advice on the end of a phone line to help them make informed choices. \u201cWhether young people are going to university, starting an apprenticeship or starting a job we want to help them take that next step into adult life.\u201d Mary Curnock Cook, the Ucas chief executive, said she was expecting a busy confirmation and clearing process but was not anticipating problems following the lifting of the cap on numbers admitted to universities. \u201cMost universities will have some courses with vacancies so there will be plenty of choice for students.\u201d She also highlighted the growing shortage of men at university: \u201cOne statistic that I\u2019m particularly interested in this year is how many men are off to university. The equivalent of 32,000 young men are missing from our university campuses as young women are on average a third more likely to go on to higher education. \u201cYoung women are powering much of the improvement in demand for HE from disadvantaged groups, so tackling the lower progression overall by men would also do much to accelerate improvements in the gap between rich and poor.\u201d", "tags": ["Teaching", "Schools", "Education", "Mathematics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-12T18:26:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/12/us-stock-markets-plunge-chinese-economy", "sentences": ["In China the Shanghai composite lost 1.03%, while the Nikkei fell 1.58%, or 327.98 points."], "title": "US stock markets follow global drop over Chinese economy concerns", "article": "US stocks rallied late on Wednesday afternoon following an earlier worldwide markets slump due to concerns about the health of the Chinese economy.

It is a major commercial port and a base for petrochemicals, refining and other industrials. The explosions happened just before midnight in an industrial area of the port filled with warehouses and containers, although there are some residential buildings a few hundred metres away. It triggered secondary explosions and blazes which burned through the night, and were still sending out clouds of black smoke in the morning. Firefighting teams had lost contact with at least two people fighting the fire. The explosion site was beside to a car warehouse and photos taken early Thursday morning by the Beijing News showed ranks of burned cars lined up in front of a building that had been stripped of doors, windows and contents by the blast.  In the background fire still smouldered, near dozens of fire trucks brought in to fight the blaze, and firefighters picked through the ruins.     The explosion in Tianjin. Photograph: Twitter    The biggest blasts, which took place within 30 seconds, were so strong that they registered at a nearby earthquake monitoring centre. The first blast was equal in strength to the detonation of three tons of TNT, while the second was the equivalent of 21 tons of the explosive, said the China Earthquake Networks Centre. The US Geological Survey registered a series of seismological actions at a station in Beijing, which is more than 160km from the blast. USGS geophysicist John Bellini said that the equipment often picks up mining blasts, but it is rare to detect seismological activity from surface events like the explosion in Tianjin.

Bellini said that multiple blasts appeared to have been recorded at the Beijing monitoring facility, and registered between magnitude two and three, but the agency was not completely certain that the activity came from the explosion in Tianjin. Also, the nature of the blast means that the seismological monitor does not give a completely accurate assessment of the explosion\u2019s magnitude. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much [is] air blast and how much of it is ground vibration,\u201d he said.

The government has not yet commented on what caused the blast, but if it is a safety lapse in the handling of dangerous shipments, it would be the latest in a long line of grim accidents. Poor safety standards and widespread corruption contribute to hundreds of deaths in China\u2019s poorly regulated private mines each year, and in other industrial accidents.

But orchestras are responding to this challenge in new and surprising ways, with exhilarating results.  I recently spent a glorious week in China conducting the soundtrack to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s classic sci-fi film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, performed live with the film by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra. It\u2019s a bold project created at London\u2019s Southbank Centre in collaboration with the British Film Institute.  And this month, I\u2019ll lead the BBC Concert Orchestra at London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall in the first live presentation of the great Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s score for the 1968 Planet of the Apes, with Charlton Heston battling his simian captors.  This kind of collaboration is becoming more common in orchestras\u2019 calendars as they struggle to fill concert halls. Increasingly, orchestras are looking for new ways to engage audiences, by performing great music that plays a familiar part in people\u2019s lives.  It\u2019s proving to be a huge success. Everywhere, orchestras are broadening their scope: live relays to cinemas, crashing pop festivals such as Latitude, and performing alongside video artists and circus performers. In a very bold move, Manchester\u2019s Hall\u00e9 Orchestra invited audiences to come along and pay what they thought the concert was worth on their way out.  The symphony orchestra is an august and venerable guardian of the greatest classical music of the past three centuries. And if that seems a bit stuffy, just think of it as the ultimate tribute band. We recreate Bach\u2019s and Mozart\u2019s definitive sound, even using replicas of 18th and 19th century instruments. We devote whole concert seasons to the music of Beethoven. There\u2019s even an entire festival and auditorium devoted to Wagner\u2019s week-long cycle of operas at the Bayreuther Festspiele. Of course, there\u2019s also our own mammoth classical Glastonbury at the BBC Proms. However, I\u2019ll bet that today more people hear orchestral music in films than anywhere else. I recently toured the UK with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) with music by film composer John Williams. After a recent concert in Northampton I was met by a biker at the stage door who said he had heard the RPO before (\u201csomebody\u2019s piano concerto \u2026 don\u2019t ask me who\u201d) and really wanted to come back to hear this amazing orchestra in something he was familiar with. The music from Star Wars was just the ticket and he and his mates roared off very happily into the night. In Europe, orchestras were formerly part of the fabric of society; they were an essential part of education and entertainment. I remember guest conducting early evening (6.30pm!) concerts in Poland and East Germany in the 1980s, before the wall came down, and being met with an audience of grannies, hipsters, parents and their toddlers. Whether they went home afterwards, out to dinner, or off clubbing, they all began their weekend together in the concert hall. In the US, the history is different. Before the pop music industry was established, \u201cclassical\u201d music had the hits worth recording. Intimidated in the face of European high culture, American audiences were guided by early record labels such as RCA\u2019s His Master\u2019s Voice (HMV), which democratised the classics through popular recordings and music appreciation classes.  Classical music stars were lionised. Enrico Caruso was the first to sell 1m copies of a record (1902); Arturo Toscanini was thrice on the cover of Time Magazine (1926, 1934 and 1948); and Leopold Stokowski and Arthur Rubinstein appeared in Hollywood films. A similar levelling is happening through the digital revolution, which has made all music immediately accessible, transforming the way orchestras reach their audience. Twitter and Facebook are essential marketing tools and increase the dialogue artists have with their audiences.  My eyes were really opened to this when in July I conducted the Royal Philharmonic in the premiere of Pete Townshend\u2019s Classic Quadrophenia at the Royal Albert Hall, with a cast including Alfie Boe, Billy Idol, Phil Daniels and Townshend himself. The euphoria the audience felt continued on social media for weeks afterwards. Why do rock stars such as Townshend, the Police\u2019s Stewart Copeland or Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood want to use orchestras? Because it gives them a bigger canvas, more colours and new and compelling ways to reach us with their music.

Tianjin, a port city of about 14 million residents, was rocked by a series of devastating explosions about 11.30pm on Wednesday night (4.30pm GMT, 1.30am AEST), according to witnesses and state media reports. So far Chinese authorities have confirmed 50 deaths, including at least 12 firefighters, and say 701 people have been admitted to hospital, of whom 71 have \u201csevere\u201d injuries.

As dawn broke over Tianjin, which is a major base for China\u2019s petrochemical and shipping industries, the extent of the destruction became clear. Drone footage showed fires raging inside the disaster zone and giant plumes of black smoke bellowing into the air. Photographs of the destruction appeared to have been taken straight from a warzone, not a bustling port city just 160km from Beijing.

One image showed a group of rescue workers crowded around what appeared to be the corpse of a victim, splayed out on a ladder. Another photograph posted on Chinese social media appeared to show a metal car wheel that had been partially melted by the inferno. Relatives of victims and the missing flocked to local hospitals where doctors described being overwhelmed by the walking wounded. \u201cThe hospital cannot count how many patients we have received \u2013 there are too many of them and many of them have burn injuries,\u201d said a doctor at one of the city\u2019s hospital, who had been called back from a conference in Beijing to treat the wounded.

Some were in a serious condition, he said. At Tianjin\u2019s Teda hospital, just a few blocks from the disaster scene, an outdoor field hospital was set up to cope with the influx of patients. Black smoke could still be seen rising into the sky and scores of volunteers were on hand outside with deliveries of stacks of bottled water. Residents of buildings between the hospital and the blast site could be seen outside their homes carrying packed bags. Nearby, virtually all of the north-facing windows on the 30-storey Vantone Central Park compound had been smashed. Shards of glass littered the ground outside the apartments.

Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, \u201curged all-out efforts to save the injured and minimize casualties\u201d. Li Keqiang, the prime minister, gave orders for authorities \u201cto intensify search and rescue\u201d. After initial reports of a fire in Tianjin\u2019s Binhai district, the city\u2019s fire department dispatched 12 teams to the scene at around 10.50pm on Wednesday. Forty minutes later, at 11.30pm, explosions tore through the area. Nine more teams of firefighters were sent to the area to battle the blaze and locate their colleagues. Hu Xiaoliang, a 32-year-old truck driver, said he had been napping under his vehicle at the time of the explosions. The force of the blast \u201ccatapulted\u201d him away from beneath the truck, he claimed. \u201cI was sleeping under my truck when the first blast occurred. It literally threw me out of the trunk. The second blast was bigger, flames came and now my truck is all ashes.\u201d           CCTV shows moment of explosion in Tianjin    The biggest blasts, which took place within 30 seconds of each other, were so powerful they registered at a nearby earthquake monitoring centre. The first blast was equal in strength to the detonation of three tons of TNT, while the second was the equivalent of 21 tons of the explosive, said the China Earthquake Networks Centre. On Thursday, as fire teams struggled to bring the fire under control details emerged of Ruihai logistics, the company that owned the warehouse at the centre of the disaster. Xinhua said the company, founded in 2011, was involved in the \u201cstorage, transfer, distribution and customs declaration of dangerous chemicals\u201d. \u201cExecutives of the company have been controlled,\u201d Xinhua said, suggesting its owners had been detained by police. The government has not yet commented on what caused the blast, but if it is a safety lapse in the handling of dangerous shipments, it would be the latest in a long line of grim accidents.

Link to video     A giant mushroom cloud rose into the sky and the blasts reduced the surrounding area \u2013 which is cluttered with high-rise residential buildings from which thousands of inhabitants have now fled \u2013 to an apocalyptic wasteland.  On Friday an article in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper asked why authorities had allowed such neighbourhoods to coexist with warehouses storing explosive and poisonous chemicals. The nearest residential compound is just 600 metres away from the warehouse, according to some reports.  \u201cPeople question why there are so many residential buildings near this storage place for dangerous goods,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily said.  It said guidelines introduced in 2001 stipulated that warehouses storing dangerous chemicals should be positioned \u201cat least 1km away from public buildings, major transport roads, railways and waterways, and industrial and mining enterprises\u201d. It asked: \u201cWhy is this 1,000m safety restriction so difficult to follow?\u201d When a Chinese journalist attempted to raise similar questions with Tianjin officials at a press conference, the state broadcaster CCTV cut off its live feed of the event.  A senior police official said on Friday the warehouse had been holding ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium carbide, and many other explosive and flammable compounds.  But teams of firefighters sent to tackle a fire at the warehouse around half an hour before the two biggest explosions had not had details of what chemicals were stored by the company when they set out, he said in an interview carried by the Xinhua news agency.  \u201cWe only knew that there were dangerous chemicals, because the products that they stored were always changing,\u201d said Lei Jinde, from the firefighting department of the public security bureau. Firefighters have been criticised for having used water because if it comes into contact with calcium carbide, the reaction produces an extremely flammable gas, acetylene. Lei said that the firefighters had asked the company owners and port authorities about the warehouse contents after arriving at the blaze, and had known that there was some calcium carbide in the complex when they decided to use water. But, he added, they had not known how much of the calcium carbide was inside the warehouse, where it was stored, or if some of it had already caught fire or exploded. \u201cOf course, firstly we wanted to bring the temperatures down,\u201d Lei said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that firefighting teams were stupid, and used water to fight the fire without realising there was calcium carbide.\u201d      A local resident looks at burnt-out buildings near the blast site.

Growth On the face of it, China has little to worry about. Official figures show that the economy is growing at an annual rate of 7%, the sort of expansion western nations can only dream about. But there are doubts about whether the official data is correct. The Economist has developed an unofficial \u201cKeqiang index\u201d, based on Li\u2019s own technique of looking at indicators such as electricity use and rail freight volumes to assess what is really going on in the economy. These provide a much less rosy picture, with rail freight volumes down 11% on a year ago and electricity production flat. Using similar measures the London-based consultancy Fathom estimates China is really growing at 3.1% a year, not 7%.   China freight figures    2. Cutting interest rates The cost of borrowing in China has been cut aggressively since the autumn of 2014 in response to the slowdown in the economy and the distress caused to property owners, local government and corporations by high debt-servicing costs. Tight monetary policy was one mechanism by which Beijing sought to slow the pace of growth amid concerns that its response to the global financial crash \u2013 cheaper credit and a fiscal boost worth 12% of GDP \u2013 had been excessive. The subsequent cut in benchmark interest rates from 6% to a record low of 4.85% suggests policymakers think the slowdown has been too rapid. 3. Putting a floor under the stockmarket The ability to buy and sell shares was seen as an example of China\u2019s growing financial maturity. But when the Shanghai Composite index fell by 30% in a month earlier this year, the government stepped in. The central bank supported share buying, a state-backed wealth fund bought up stocks and fund managers were prevailed on not to sell until the market had recovered. Far from restoring calm, the moves suggested Beijing was afraid of a damaging crash.   China momentum indicator   4. Declining exports A move away from an over-dependence on exports is official government policy. But the recent weakness in the sale of goods overseas has been more marked than expected, and has helped to contribute to declining world trade and the drop in commodity prices. The cost of maintaining the yuan\u2019s level against the US dollar has been a drop in foreign exchange reserves and an 8.3% drop in exports in the 12 months to July. 5. A cheaper currency As a result of its weakening economy, China has abandoned its currency peg with the dollar and reduced the yuan\u2019s exchange rate on three separate occasions this week. Beijing has put a brave face on this move, saying it is designed to get the yuan included in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s reserve assets known as special drawing rights. A more obvious explanation is that China is seeking to boost growth by making its exports cheaper \u2013 a return to the growth model it is supposed to be abandoning.   yuan v dollar ", "tags": ["Chinese economy", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Currencies", "Global economy", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-14T15:11:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/16/china-does-not-want-currency-war-with-west-says-central-bank-economist", "sentences": ["To prevent a collapse in the Shanghai market, the authorities were forced into an embarrassing climbdown that involved abandoning tough lending rules designed to prevent traders from excessive borrowing.", "The China Securities Regulatory Commission has organised a so-called \u201cnational team\u201d of state-owned brokers and fund managers, who have pledged not to sell shares until the Shanghai Composite index returns to 4,500 points."], "title": "China does not want 'currency war' with west, says central bank economist", "article": "China\u2019s central bank has warned of further volatility in the yuan but reiterated that Beijing had no intention of sparking a \u201ccurrency war\u201d following a series of shock devaluations last week. The chief economist at the People\u2019s Bank of China, Ma Jun, said the Chinese government had \u201cno intention or need to participate in a currency war\u201d. In a concerted effort to play down fears of tit-for-tat devaluations with the US, Europe and Japan, he said Beijing would intervene only in exceptional circumstances to counteract excessive volatility.   Related: Eight reasons why China\u2019s currency crisis matters to us all    The yuan\u2019s drop last week, and its increased flexibility as a result, could help sharply reduce the possibility of similar adjustments in future, Ma said. However, he added it was more likely there would be \u201ctwo-way volatility\u201d, or appreciation and depreciation of the national currency in response to economic ups and downs. Referring to the possibility of further interventions, he said: \u201cIn the future, even if the central bank needed to intervene in the market, it may be in either direction.\u201d Ma\u2019s intervention, in an email sent to Reuters, came after a surprise devaluation by the Chinese authorities last week that sparked panic-selling on the world\u2019s stock markets. A near 2% cut in the yuan against the US dollar on Tuesday was matched the following day by a further devaluation, only for the currency\u2019s reference rate, which is set each day, to be raised slightly on Thursday, stabilising the situation at the end of the week. Investors, already concerned after a long period of weak economic data coming out of China, had feared that desperate officials in Beijing were prepared to force down the yuan\u2019s value as the only way to turnaround the country\u2019s fortunes. Former US ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, told CNN that Washington would be right to voice concern about a deliberate policy of devaluations by Beijing.      \u2018You get a sense as to why people are very, very frustrated with China,\u2019 said former US ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters    \u201cChina is no longer an average player in the global economy. They\u2019re the second largest economy in the world. And when you have the devaluation of 2% right off the bat automatically \u2013 you\u2019re going to have a higher cost burden on the exports from the United States to Asia, and to one of our largest export markets, to say nothing of the impact it\u2019s going to have on the region. \u201cSo when you look at the immediate import that it had on currencies \u2013 you get a sense as to why people are very, very frustrated with China,\u201d he said.  Ma\u2019s comments are likely to be interpreted as an attempt by China\u2019s central bank to regain control of the yuan ahead of trading this week, when analysts expect further cuts in the yuan\u2019s value.  Several analysts said last week that the Chinese wanted to push down the value of the yuan to make its exports cheaper without antagonising rival trading blocs. A 10% devaluation against the US dollar was cited as the target of the PBoC to regain what it sees as a competitive rate with Washington.

To prevent a collapse in the Shanghai market, the authorities were forced into an embarrassing climbdown that involved abandoning tough lending rules designed to prevent traders from excessive borrowing.  Ma also said that he expected the economy to grow by about 7% this year \u2013 in line with the government\u2019s target.

It had all started six years earlier in 1930, when Powell had stumbled across a short article in the Observer about the then-ongoing evacuation of St Kilda and decided it was the perfect subject for the film to make his name. He was, of course, destined to become one of the titans of postwar British film, with classics such as A Matter of Life and Death and Peeping Tom. But this account of the making of his first major film, also called The Edge of the World, is something else entirely \u2013 an inadvertently fresh and racy portrait of prewar Britain. The poignant story of the Scottish island of St Kilda \u2013 stranded dozens of miles west of the Scottish mainland \u2013 would, alone, fill several books (indeed it has). The islanders lived in virtual isolation for centuries until the military arrived during the first world war, forcing them to accept that that their world was obsolete, and eventually prompting their migration. The dramatic potential of the story itself is obvious \u2013 but Powell\u2019s book about the obstacles he faced to get the film made, many of which would have overwhelmed a less resourceful and determined person, has its own gripping hold. Powell\u2019s plan, in 1936, when he was finally ready to make his film, was to shoot on St Kilda itself, and his script was designed to accommodate the dramatic landscape and buildings. He duly assembled his cast and crew, only to have the island\u2019s owner \u2013 terrified of the effect a film crew might have on the place \u2013 withdraw permission at the last minute. Faced with finding another location within 24 hours or abandoning the film, Powell was pointed towards another possible candidate: an island to the west of Shetland called Foula. Having adapted his script and reassembled his crew, Powell and his gang set off on what turned out to be as much an adventure as a film shoot. Powell\u2019s tale really gets going in the second part, when the crew is finally ensconced in Shetland and ready to film. Offering glimpses of what would make him such an innovative film-maker during his later collaborations with Emeric Pressburger, Powell eschews the customary dictatorial role of director and inaugurates a democratic \u201cparliament\u201d in the camp. His tale of living and working together, an embryonic version of the \u201ccastaway\u201d-style reality shows, is magical, and there\u2019s even a final-act real-life drama to round things off. Nobody would accuse Powell, on the strength of this book, of being a literary stylist, but the fog-bound world he conjures up, and the wonderful cast of characters he encounters, from grumpy landowners to enterprising journalists, makes for a gripping portrait of another time and place.", "tags": ["Autobiography and memoir", "Biography", "Books", "Film", "Culture", "Michael Powell", "Film"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-18T16:58:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/18/china-shares-plunge-fears-government-support-central-bank", "sentences": ["The Shanghai composite index dropped 6.12% and Shenzhen 6.6% on Tuesday, their steepest fall since the 8.5% slide on 27 July."], "title": "Chinese shares plunge over fears about end of government support", "article": "Chinese stock markets fell sharply in the final hour of trading after investors were rattled by fears about the withdrawal of government support for shares and further capital flight following the devaluation of the yuan last week.

Sheila Keetharuth, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea who collected the evidence, said in July: \u201cForced labour was used, especially in the construction phase, for the simple reason that all construction [operations] are done under the government.\u201d Eritrea\u2019s national service programme requires every citizen over 18 to serve in the military or work for the government, often indefinitely.

Six months afterwards, this was increased to 860 nakfa per month.\u201d Last December three Eritreans filed a lawsuit against Nevsun in a Canadian court over allegations that it forced them to work long hours for little pay. Nevsun has denied that forced labour has been used at its mine, and the company has said it will \u201cvigorously defend itself\u201d against the lawsuit. Cliff Davis, Nevsun\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cWe are confident that the allegations are unfounded.

The Eritrean government did not allow the UN commission to visit Eritrea. \u201cThey should have allowed us in the country ... and allowed us to see what was the situation inside,\u201d Keetharuth said.  Nevsun also rejected the UN\u2019s findings: \u201cA recent UN commission report included some sensational and unbelievable human rights allegations with respect to the Bisha Mine, which allegations were made without visiting either the mine or the country,\u201d said Davis. The use of conscripted labour in Eritrea\u2019s mining sector was first reported by Human Rights Watch in 2013, who said: \u201cNevsun\u2019s experiences show that by developing projects in Eritrea, mining firms are walking into a potential minefield of human rights problems. Most notably they risk getting entangled in the Eritrean government\u2019s uniquely abusive program of indefinite forced labour \u2013 the inaptly-named \u2018national service program\u2019.\u201d More than 130,000 people have signed a petition asking Nevsun to \u201cstop supporting slavery in Eritrea, or else close the Bisha mine\u201d.

Photograph: Screengrab/Nevsun Resources Ltb    Untapped resources The country\u2019s fragile economy has become dependent on revenues from its burgeoning mining sector, which has attracted a host of Australian, Canadian and Chinese firms all looking to cash in on untapped mineral reserves. There are four mines being developed in Eritrea at present, but just one is currently exporting minerals. Bisha, which began mining gold before transitioning to copper production in 2013, has generated $755m (\u00a3484.74m) in revenues for the Eritrean government since it broke ground in 2011, according to financial statements released by Nevsun (pdf). These funds are a lifeline for a regime that has been crippled by UN sanctions, imposed after reports emerged that President Isaias Afwerki\u2019s government was training and funding Somali Islamist group al-Shabaab, a charge that Eritrea has denied. Eritrea does not publish an annual budget, but the government has said that mining revenues are spent on development programmes.       The mineral boom is currently driving an economic resurgence, with the country posting a record $3.8bn in gross domestic product last year. The Eritrea National Mining Corporation has reported further deposits of gold, copper, potash, zinc, oil, natural gas, cement, gypsum, granite, marble, ceramics, limestone and iron ore. More mines are due to begin production in the next two years. Canadian firm Sunridge Gold has said it will begin gold output from its Asmara mine this year, while Australian mining company Danakali has said it will announce this year when it will begin potash production at its Colluli mine. Another company, Sfeco, a subsidiary of Chinese firm Shanghai Construction Group, is developing its Zara gold mine in the north of the country, but has not yet indicated when it will start production. Sfeco and Danalaki have not yet commented on the human rights situation in the country.

The Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah have been in freefall for months, and the Thai baht was haemorrhaging support long before the Bangkok shrine bombing. Figures showing that emerging markets have suffered a near-$1tn (\u00a3640bn) outflow of funds over the last year give another indication that countries billed as the stars of the post-crash economy are now waning. According to a compilation of official data and estimates by the investment bank NN Investment Partners, total net capital outflows from the 19 largest emerging market economies reached $940.2bn in the 13 months to the end of July.  The Netherlands-based bank said the figure was almost double the net outflow during the nine months following the 2008 banking collapse. Asia is not the only area to suffer. Turkey, Brazil and Mexico are among the other emerging economies to see capital flight back to the US and Europe. As their currencies shrink in value, it takes more cash to fund foreign debt payments in dollars. The report shows that emerging markets have spent vast portions of their foreign reserves to meet obligations that were much less onerous only a year before.    Emerging market reserves   Investors quitting emerging markets either sell property and stock market assets or simply take out and repatriate cash from local banks. If returned to the US, that cash might make a lower return but there will be less risk attached. Adding to the weakening picture, the latest survey of investor sentiment by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the threat of a recession in China and a broader emerging market debt crisis have eclipsed the eurozone\u2019s woes as principal concerns. Stock markets have tumbled in response. China has already suffered one calamitous crash this year and in recent days has appeared to be on the brink of another. A 6% plunge on Tuesday in the benchmark Shanghai Composite was followed by further 5% drop on Wednesday before a recovery pushed the index to finish 1.2% up at 3,794.11 points. The volatile nature of emerging market stocks and shares is not just a symptom of thin trading in August or speculators exaggerating market movements with their heavy bets. These factors probably play a part, but analysts have placed greater weight on global trade figures that show a slowdown over the last six months. Global trade declined by 8% between December 2014 and May 2015. It had previously recovered strongly since 2009, driven largely by emerging economies feeding off a China-induced stimulus to world trade. The momentum was lost last year, however, and a head of steam that saw a 40% rise in world trade over six years has vanished. China played a big part in the slowdown after the new political leadership in Beijing announced its determination to wean the economy off cheap borrowing that had fuelled a destabilising property boom.  Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Lombard Street Research and a China expert, pointed out in a report that a contraction in the money supply, led by a retreat in bank lending, illustrated how well the policy was working.  She said: \u201cBroad money growth, the best indicator of overall monetary conditions in an economy, has slowed to its lowest rate on record in recent months. Over the past few years the People\u2019s Bank of China [PBoC] has introduced an alphabet soup of new monetary policy tools, but the liquidity injected through these facilities has not been large.    Capital flows   \u201cNot only has the PBoC been sparing in doling out cash to the banks, but credit growth has remained fairly subdued \u2013 a stark contrast to 2009.\u201d She said the world was living through a deliberate rebalancing by the Chinese authorities that the west will have to accommodate in order for it to work. An overreaction in the form of competitive devaluations by the US or Japan would wreck China\u2019s efforts and bring further anxiety to world markets. The US is already pushing up the value of its currency with anticipation about a rise in domestic interest rates. The Federal Reserve could raise rates within the next couple of months, and though the higher rate is largely factored into currency markets, there will be another boost to the dollar when it happens.    Related: How a Fed rates rise creates issues for emerging markets    A second rise will probably knock emerging markets further, as the US becomes an even more attractive destination for investment funds. An expected hike in the UK, where Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has signalled a move towards 2% starting in the spring, could intensify the pressure further. Some emerging economies will fare worse than others. Turkey\u2019s lira has lost around 20% of its value against the dollar so far this year, making it one of the worst performing emerging market currencies. An inconclusive election and its proximity to fighting in Syria have played their part in fuelling fears of economic turmoil, but the broader consideration is the hefty extra $3.8bn Ankara must pay on its energy import bill and the dependence of its major corporations on borrowed funds. These funds were borrowed in dollars and are increasingly expensive to finance. Higher interest rates in the US will make the situation worse. Earlier this week, the central bank left its base interest rate unchanged at 7.5%, despite ministers\u2019 clamour for a cut. The bank knows such a move would make investing in Turkey less attractive and accelerate the flow of funds out of the country. Countries that spurned cheap dollars in the aftermath of the crash are expected to be insulated from US rate rises. For Turkey and the rest it will be a rocky ride.", "tags": ["Emerging markets", "Economics", "International trade", "Business", "Global economy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Turkey", "Currencies"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-19T19:36:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/19/ftse-100-index-record-lowest-level-in-seven-months", "sentences": ["The selloff began in China on Wednesday, where an initial slump of 5% in the Shanghai Composite Index was reversed as authorities signalled their continued financial support for higher prices."], "title": "FTSE 100 index closes at its lowest level in seven months", "article": "The FTSE 100 index has slipped to its lowest level since January as global investors reacted to concerns that a slowdown in China will undermine demand for oil and industrial metals in the world\u2019s second largest economy.  Weak data from the US helped drive fears that global growth is slowing and commodity prices have much further to fall, hitting mining and oil stocks in London as well as shares across Europe. The selloff began in China on Wednesday, where an initial slump of 5% in the Shanghai Composite Index was reversed as authorities signalled their continued financial support for higher prices. However, US figures revealing lower than expected inflation and a glut in oil production then hit stock markets in Europe, as investors expressed concerns that a global slowdown could accelerate.      FTSE 100 Index   Mining conglomerate Glencore was the biggest faller as the FTSE 100 sank almost 2% to 6403. The company, which owns a vast array of mines from Chile to Norway, lost almost 10% of its value, bringing its total loss to more than 40% since May or \u00a318bn. Rival miners Rio Tinto and Anglo American, which saw share price declines of 3.5% and 4.5% respectively, were also dragged lower in a febrile market that saw billions of pounds lost by several of Britain\u2019s major corporations. Any euphoria following the Greece deal with Brussels that had sent continental stock markets higher earlier in the week evaporated as fears over China and the direction of global trade took centre stage. The German Dax fell more than 2% to 10682 while the Paris-based CAC was down 1.7% at 4844. The Dow Jones in New York closed almost 1% down. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cMarkets are looking east and don\u2019t like what they are seeing. Slowing economic growth, currency devaluation and stock market mayhem in China have hit commodities and mining stocks, and with them the UK stock market. \u201cThe fact UK stocks fell so steeply despite Germany signing off on the Greek bailout underlines how peripheral this issue has now become, and how quickly the market can switch its focus,\u201d he said. The FTSE 100 index is heavily skewed to oil and mining companies. Together they make up about of a fifth of the index. The combined loss of value for the mining sector was 4.7%, taking it to its lowest level since 2009. Oil prices also registered losses after falling about 4%. US crude hit a six and a half year low and threatened to break below $40, after figures showing an unexpectedly large stockpile reinforced concerns about a growing global oil glut. US crude inventories rose by 2.6m barrels last week to 456.21m, the government\u2019s Energy Information Administration said. The figures stunned energy market analysts on Wall Street, as well as traders and investors who had been expecting a cut in the stockpile.  US over-production stems in part from a new generation of fracking plants, many of them uneconomic at current prices, maintaining operations. The oil-rich middle east countries have kept pumping at levels more aligned with a strongly recovering world economy. But reductions in global demand for oil, especially in south east Asia, have created a mismatch between supply and demand, forcing a return to rock-bottom prices last seen at the beginning of the year. The price of Brent, the global benchmark for oil, was down $1.72, or 3.5%, at $47.09 a barrel. Prices traded above $110 before a decline last summer that followed worse than expected manufacturing and industrial production figures from China. A recovery in the spring pushed oil above $60, but renewed fears of a global slowdown has seen prices fall by a third since June.  The intentions of the US Federal Reserve are also unsettling investors. The US central bank could raise interest rates as soon as next month after a series of speeches by boss Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed was readying itself for a rise. Minutes of its last meeting showed that many of its voting members believe the date of a rate rise is nearing. But several weeks of lacklustre US figures and the worsening situation in China could derail their plans and force a delay until next year. Robert Parkes, a strategist at HSBC, said he believed the pessimism surrounding China was overdone and the picture would brighten in the coming months. He expects China to react to the deteriorating situation with a cut in interest rates that would stimulate domestic demand and boost growth in the second half of the year.", "tags": ["FTSE", "Stock markets", "Business", "Shares", "Economics", "Money", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-19T20:05:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/20/didier-drogba-big-game-player-montreal-chelsea", "sentences": ["Drogba left for Shanghai Shenhua, then rocked up at Galatasaray, where he won the league and \u2013 this is getting old \u2013 scored the only goal in the final of the Turkish Super Cup."], "title": "A brief guide to \u2026\u00a0Didier Drogba, the biggest of big-game players", "article": "English football has been blessed with quite a few big-game players down the years, the guy who always shows up when it really matters. Ian Rush scored five goals in three FA Cup finals for Liverpool, an all-time record. John Robertson played in two European Cup finals for Nottingham Forest, scoring the winner in one and setting up the winner in the other. Bobby Charlton scored the goals that sent his country to a World Cup final, and another two for his team in a European Cup final. Steven Gerrard has notched in every major club final possible. Eric Cantona\u2019s FA Cup final report reads played two, took care of business in two. The same goes for Roberto di Matteo. Alan Kennedy decided two European Cup finals. As a self-confessed bog-standard left-back for Liverpool. But none of these figures \u2013 legends all, in their many different ways \u2013 can hold a candle to Didier Drogba. The big Ivorian\u2019s record in the biggest matches has been simply astonishing. Second to none. The ultimate big-game player. So naturally, having said all that, we\u2019re forced to report that Drogba\u2019s first big game ended in failure. He was part of the Marseille team beaten 2-0 by Valencia in the 2004 Uefa Cup final. (He\u2019d joined the French giants from Guingamp, having moved there in turn from Le Mans, where he\u2019d been scouted by Arsene Wenger. The Arsenal boss passed, thinking the young man wasn\u2019t quite ready. But we digress.)   Related: Didier Drogba\u2019s glory may have faded, but for Chelsea he\u2019ll always be glorious | Barney Ronay    There was no shame in Marseille\u2019s 2-0 defeat that year, as Rafael Benitez\u2019s side, newly crowned as Spanish champions, were arguably the best team in Europe at the time. And in any case, the campaign had been a personal success for Drogba, putting him on the European map. Marseille were competing in the Uefa Cup having been cashiered from the group stage of the Champions League, in which Drogba had scored against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, helped himself to a hat-trick against Partizan Belgrade, and put one past parsimonious Porto, who went on to win the tournament under Jose Mourinho. Then in the Uefa Cup, Drogba was instrumental in dispatching Liverpool, Internazionale and Newcastle United on their run to the final. Mourinho\u2019s success at Porto had earned the Portuguese a move to Chelsea, and having been impressed by Drogba\u2019s direct and skilful play at close quarters, he dangled $40m (\u00a324m) in front of Marseille\u2019s nose. Juventus were also interested, but Drogba plumped for Chelsea. It would prove an inspired choice. Drogba scored 16 goals in his first season at Stamford Bridge, helping the club to only the second English championship in their history, a cool 50 years after the first. He also put Chelsea ahead in extra-time of a tumultuous League Cup final with Liverpool, giving his team a lead they would never relinquish. After which, scoring in cup finals became second nature to the big man. Drogba subsequently won three more league titles at Chelsea \u2013 as an integral part of the team in 2006 and 2010, and as a veteran earlier this year \u2013 but it\u2019s the finals that really define him. The 2007 League Cup final is mainly remembered these days for Abou Diaby kicking John Terry\u2019s head clean over the big arch at Wembley, and an equally entertaining bench-emptying brawl during injury time. But it was Drogba whose two goals decided the destination of the trophy when a football match finally broke out. Chelsea completed a cup double that year, when Drogba won the FA Cup late on against Manchester United, exchanging passes with Frank Lampard on the edge of the United box before guiding the ball past a helpless Edwin van der Sar. A brilliant goal in a terrible game.     Chelsea\u2019s Drogba celebrates scoring in extra time to win the FA Cup final in 2007. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters    There were no cups for Chelsea the following year, despite two finals being contested, but Drogba still proved an electric presence in both big games. The League Cup was lost to Tottenham Hotspur, even though Drogba had given his side the lead with a free-kick that made him the first player to score in three different League Cup finals. Drogba then eviscerated Liverpool in the semi-final of the Champions League, anger his fuel after Rafael Benitez had accused him in a pre-match press conference of diving. Two decisive goals were the inevitable result. Drogba had powered Chelsea to the final of Europe\u2019s premier tournament for the first time ever. That match, against Manchester United in Moscow, would not go to plan for Chelsea, culminating in what would be English football\u2019s most famous slip for nearly six years, until Demba Ba did John Terry a solid. A tearful Terry became the symbol of the disappointment of losing to United on penalty skids, which kind of got Drogba off the hook. He was unlucky to hit the post in the second half of the match, but later disgraced himself, sent off in extra time for giving Nemanja Vidic a clip upside the head. He remains one of only two players to see red in a European Cup/Champions League final, Jens Lehmann of Arsenal the other, two years earlier. So Chelsea were denied the penalty-taking prowess of their top striker in the resulting shoot-out, and look what happened. Oh John! Oh Didier! Still, he\u2019d make up for it later, and how. Drogba should have had the chance to make amends the following season, but Chelsea were diddled by some preposterous refereeing decisions in the Champions League semi against Barcelona. The red mist descended when Andreas Iniesta scored an injury-time goal that sent Barca to the final instead of Chelsea. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking disgrace!\u201d Drogba bellowed into a live television camera. He was banned for one European game, but it was worth it. What a glorious funk. A little succour arrived in the FA Cup final against Everton. Chelsea had been shocked by the quickest-ever goal in the showpiece event\u2019s history, a 25-second stunner from Louis Saha. But it was Drogba whose header midway through the first half settled Chelsea down, and they went on to win the match 2-1. The trophy was retained a year later against relegated Portsmouth, Drogba naturally with the only goal. Two seasons later, Drogba scored what would prove to be the winner in a 2-1 victory in another FA Cup final, this time against Liverpool. Then the fairytale end, in Chelsea\u2019s second Champions League final. The jig looked up against Bayern Munich, who were leading through Thomas Muller\u2019s late goal, in their own Allianz Arena ground. Then Fernando Torres chased a lost cause down the right wing and made enough of a nuisance of himself to win a corner. Juan Mata took, and Drogba crashed a header home. The hero. And then, so nearly, once again the extra-time zero. Drogba clumsily bundled over Franck Ribery to gift Bayern a penalty. But Arjen Robben wafted a risible effort straight at Petr Cech. The game went to a shoot-out, and Drogba sent Manuel Neuer the wrong way to seal the deal. Chelsea, who as champions had declined an invitation to play in the very first European Cup in 1955, had finally reached the summit. And it was Drogba \u2013 who else? \u2013 who hauled them up there. It was his last kick for the club. Or so it seemed at the time. What a way to go out. Drogba left for Shanghai Shenhua, then rocked up at Galatasaray, where he won the league and \u2013 this is getting old \u2013 scored the only goal in the final of the Turkish Super Cup. He made an emotional and valedictory return to Chelsea, picking up that fourth league medal, though in truth the most memorable event of a brief remarriage was his chairing off the field in his final appearance in a blue shirt against Sunderland \u2013 with the match only half-an-hour old. And there\u2019s Chelsea fans mocking Liverpudlians for being gloriously sentimental. The thread of the big-game narrative frays slightly on the international stage. Ivory Coast were probably the best \u2013 certainly the most consistent \u2013 African team of the last couple of decades, but clutch results were hard to come by. Drogba did maintain his habit of delivering on the big stage \u2013 he scored against both Argentina and Brazil in World Cup matches \u2013 but also fluffed his lines in the African Cup of Nations. He missed a penalty in the 2006 final shootout against Egypt, then failed from the spot during the 2012 final against Zambia. Ivory Coast won the competition in 2015, but by this time Drogba had retired from international football. Ah well, nobody\u2019s perfect. But being the driving force behind Chelsea\u2019s astonishing run of success between 2004 and 2012 more than compensates. Nationality ensures Terry and Lampard usually get the bulk of the credit with the English press, but let\u2019s be honest with ourselves: when it came to taking care of business when it really mattered, Drogba was always the go-to guy.

Hooray! \u201cChip shop scallops\u201d (1750; really?), the northern delicacy of potato slices fried in batter. I used to live above a chippy that sold these in a buttered roll: uhuh. Albina\u2019s come with charred broccoli, broccoli puree and toasted seeds, a strangely pleasurable wodge of vegetal stodge. There\u2019s lamb\u2019s tongue (1679), done in an almost Sainte-Menehould way \u2013 fried in breadcrumbs with a stinging salsa verde (or green sauce, in Albina-speak) \u2013 the mellow organ a fabulous contrast to the crunchy crumb and its bed of taut little beans. And a \u201csignature\u201d dish of slow-braised beef shin (1979; oh, you get the idea): meat of intoxicating richness, a cake of pressed potato slices fudgey with butter, shredded bacon, smoky and&nbsp;fibrous, all slicked with a vinous mushroom sauce. It\u2019s a mess, but it\u2019s&nbsp;a hot mess. \nInevitably, given the, um, ambition, there\u2019s the odd misfire: ham hock mousse \u2013 around a noisette of truly luscious rose veal served as pink as its name \u2013 is a touch slurry. Massive shame: with its buttery pastry, charred baby vegetables and sherry gravy, this is an otherwise killer dish. There\u2019s a tendency towards dryness \u2013 a special (yep, there are specials, too) of black pudding, sage and sausage in a little pastry turnover would benefit from a bit of lubrication. As would a starter of spelt stained with beetroot, crowned with a languidly ripe slab of Waterloo cheese and horseradish crumble. Still kind of love it, though. I\u2019ve unreserved affection, however, for a limpid, cool tea jelly, topped with tea cream and confit lemon peel, served with gooey ginger cookies: sultry, seductive, utterly splendid. Oh, and a sticky toffee pudding the size of a family loaf. \nThe place itself is endearingly odd, its woody exterior still defiantly saying Albion (they had to change the name after a legal spat with Sir Terence Conran, who had trademarked Albion. Extraordinary behaviour on Sir Tel\u2019s part). I\u2019d expected urban chic, since co-owner and chef Stephen Burgess was one of the founders of the city\u2019s cool Camp &amp; Furnace. But with its blocky modern furniture, tin menu from \u201cWet Nelly\u2019s\u201d, dripping candle wax and cosy neuks, it looks like it was decorated by that chip-shop owner\u2019s wacky mother-in-law. \nThey call themselves \u201ceccentric\u201d. You don\u2019t say. Other menu items include a \u201cpalaver\u201d of short rib, kale, shrimp butter and okra, and a \u201cScottish\u201d mixed grill heaving with venison, battered haggis, square sausage, neeps, pork faggot and oatmealed egg.

China\u2019s factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years in August as domestic and export demand dwindled, a private survey showed, adding to worries that the world\u2019s second-largest economy may be slowing sharply and sending financial markets into a tailspin. Tony Cross, an analyst with Trustnet Direct in London, said the FTSE could be heading for its worst week this year. \u201cAs it stands, the FTSE 100 is on course to post its biggest weekly decline of the year so far and there\u2019s not a great deal on the agenda that would appear to have the ability to salvage the situation before the weekend break,\u201d he said.

European shares also fell to a seven-month low on mounting concerns about China\u2019s economy. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 1% to 1,462.78 points, its lowest level since January and on course for its biggest weekly fall of the year.

US crude hit fresh six-and-a-half year lows near $40 a barrel as it headed for its eighth straight weekly decline, the longest weekly losing streak since 1986. Brent crude for October delivery was down more than 1% at $46.02 by lunchtime in London. Shares in Australia are having their worst month since the global financial crisis hit in October 2008. The benchmark ASX200 closed down 1.4% at 5,214 points, taking the loss for August so far to 8.5%, according to broker Commsec.        The Australian dollar was also hammered, falling 0.45% and went as low as US72.85c. The Aussie, which is seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy, has fallen about 1% in the past week.  Japan\u2019s economics minister, Akira Amari, said on Friday he expected China\u2019s government to take steps to prevent its economic slowdown from becoming a global problem.  The preliminary Caixin/Markit China manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) stood at 47.1 in August, well below economists\u2019 expectations of 47.7 and down from July\u2019s final 47.8.  The reading was the worst since March 2009, the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth straight one below the 50-point level, which separates growth in activity from contraction on a monthly basis.  The flash PMI, the earliest economic measure to be released about China each month, is closely followed by global investors for clues on the health of the economy.  \u201cThe poor number confirms what higher frequency data has been suggesting, that more weakness in the economy is likely,\u201d said Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast in Singapore. He added: \u201cThe authorities claimed that there will be a rebound in demand in the second half but it appears that the opposite is happening. With first half GDP scraping the bottom of the barrel at 7%, the authorities will have a fight on their hands to ensure that the second half of the year comes in at even the same level.\u201d  A detailed breakdown of the activity survey showed conditions were deteriorating on almost every level, with factory output sinking to a near four-year low, domestic and export orders declining at a faster rate than in July and companies laid off more workers.

Amid growing concern over a potential hard landing for China and the prospect of a US rate rise, there have been sharp moves on commodity and currency markets as well.  \u201cMarkets finished the week much the way they started; worried about the impact of a sell-off in emerging market stocks and currencies. No market has been spared this week since slowing global growth has a global impact,\u201d commented Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets UK. Here are the big six factor affecting markets. 1. China\u2019s stock market rout   Shanghai stocks   Chinese shares have tumbled in recent weeks against the backdrop of a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Buoyed by an army of individual investors, many of whom borrowed heavily to speculate on shares, the Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months before heavy selling started in June. Despite emergency measures from Beijing officials designed to stabilise the markets and restore confidence in the economy, this week alone the Shanghai Composite Index fell more than 11%. 2. The falling yuan   Yuan   China\u2019s surprise currency devaluation earlier this month only served to heighten fears about the state of its economy and the potential impact on the rest of the world.  In the biggest one-off devaluation of its currency in two decades the country\u2019s central bank allowed the yuan, also called the renminbi, to weaken by nearly 2%. Economists note that the fall has been significant enough to dent investor confidence around the world but at the same time probably too small to do much for Chinese exports.  3. Tumbling oil prices   Oil prices   The apparent slowdown in China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, has combined with a pick-up in crude production to knock oil prices down sharply. The price of Brent crude has more than halved since a peak of $115 per barrel last summer. The news this weak of a sharp drop in Chinese manufacturing fanned fears that demand for oil has further to fall and at under $46 per barrel now, Brent crude is near a six-year low reached earlier this year. US crude prices have fallen for eight weeks running, the most protracted decline since 1986. 4. An interest rate shock waiting to happen?   Interest rates   Monetary policy has been ultra-loose in advanced economies for years now. The global financial crisis prompted record low interest rates and saw central banks pump floods of electronic money into gridlocked financial markets, via quantitative easing (QE) programmes.  Now investors are asking when the policymakers will tighten the screws. In the US, the main policy rate has been held at near-zero since the 2008 crisis. Recent signals from the US Federal Reserve suggest the central bank is gearing up for the first interest rate increase in nearly a decade as soon as next month. The prospect of higher borrowing costs and a strengthening dollar have unsettled financial markets and prompted big moves of capital.  5. Emerging markets rattled   Ringgit   During the years of cheap money on the back of vast QE programmes in advanced economies, there were large flows of funds to developing economies. With interest rates low at home, investors from advanced economies parked their money in the higher-yielding currencies of the emerging economies.  But now expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in coming months have prompted money to pour back out of emerging markets. Such markets suffered an outflow of almost $1tn of funds in the past year. On top of that, China\u2019s slowdown and stock market woes are rippling out to knock confidence in other emerging markets. Malaysia\u2019s ringgit currency has been one of the big losers, falling to a fresh 17-year low on Friday. The falls in emerging market currencies, which also include the Indonesian rupiah and Thai baht, make it harder for governments and businesses to make payments in dollars. 6. Gold in demand   Gold   Gold prices have been choppy in recent weeks, as two big market forces play off against each other. Gold does not pay any kind of interest or dividend to its holders and so money has flowed out of the precious metal on the prospect of higher US interest rates. It hit a five-year low in July.  But at the same time gold continues to be seen as a safe investment in times of trouble and the latest market jitters and fears of a global slowdown have lifted the price. Against the backdrop of tumbling stocks and a sliding dollar, gold touched a six-week high on Friday.", "tags": ["Global economy", "Business", "Economics", "Chinese economy", "China", "Oil", "Federal Reserve", "US economy", "Currencies", "Commodities", "Stock markets", "US interest rates", "Asia Pacific", "Emerging markets", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-21T18:18:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/21/us-markets-china-slump-global-sell-off", "sentences": ["Following the report the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 4.3% to its lowest level since March."], "title": "Dow drops more than 500 points as US markets plummet amid global sell-off", "article": "US stock markets dropped dramatically on Friday afternoon, dragging overall global markets to their worst week of the year as concerns about the health of the Chinese economy rattled investors across the world.

The Dow Jones index has lost about 10% from its record closing high on 19 May, mean it is entering a correction \u2013 a fall of at least 10% from a recent peak. The Dow has not fallen into correction territory since October 2011. Friday\u2019s fall takes the Dow to its sharpest weekly decline in four years.

The FTSE 100 has fallen by 5.6% this week, which equates to around \u00a393bn ($146bn) being wiped off the value of the UK\u2019s largest listed companies.   ftse   The Euro Stoxx 50, the continent\u2019s 50 biggest companies, closed down 2.94% to 3,254.77 points and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 1.8% to 1,450.18 points, its lowest level since January and on course for its biggest weekly fall of the year. France\u2019s CAC-40 declined 2.2% while Germany\u2019s DAX fell 1.9%.  The global stock market falls came after Beijing released manufacturing data showing fresh evidence of problems at the heart of the Chinese economy. The preliminary Caixin China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for August fell to a 77-month low. Following the report the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 4.3% to its lowest level since March. \u201cChina has sent shockwaves through global markets and raised numerous questions on the outlook,\u201d analysts at Societe Generale said. \u201cTo our minds, the gradual recovery taking shape in the advanced economies can weather what we expect will be a prolonged period of weaker growth in a number of the major emerging markets.\u201d David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: \u201cChina has been on a mission to keep up the illusion of a gradual slowdown, but dealers aren\u2019t buying it anymore.\u201d Nigel Green, chief executive of financial consulting firm deVere Group, told Reuters: \u201cThere are many, and legitimate, contributing factors to the global economic slowdown narrative. These include China-related issues, such as the recent devaluation of its currency, the stock market\u2019s boom and bust in recent months, and slower GDP growth. \u201cI believe that this volatility is likely to remain with us, at least until the end of the year ... But for most long-term investors, fears of a near-term financial apocalypse are overdone.\u201d   Related: Global market turmoil in six charts    Connor Campbell, an analyst at Financials, predicted more lows to come. Oil and mining stocks were \u201cdrowning in losses\u201d from the beginning of the day, he said. Japan\u2019s Nikkei average dropped almost 3% to six-week lows on Friday, while the Kopsi index in South Korea fell 1.92%.  The Australian stock market, which is heavily loaded with companies reliant on Chinese growth, closed down 1.4%. The benchmark ASX 200 has lost 8.5% so far this month \u2013 the steepest monthly fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.  The Australian dollar, considered a liquid proxy for China demand, slid to $0.7285 at one point and was last trading at $0.7330, a fall of 0.08%. The Malaysian ringgit hit a 17-year low and South Korea\u2019s won fell again to take its weekly losses against the dollar to 1.8%.  \u201cThe perfect storm that has enveloped EM local markets looks set to continue,\u201d Barclays analysts said in a note.  Crude oil prices, which have come under growing pressure from oversupply from the US, Russia and the Middle East, fell in response to concerns that lower manufacturing output in China will cut world demand. Brent crude closed at $45.30 a barrel, down from more than $60 in June and $115 little more than a year ago. Lower oil prices are expected to boost growth in the US, Japan and the major importing nations in Europe in the longer term, but the initial impact has been felt on emerging economies that export oil and other basic commodities that have also slumped in price. Oil\u2019s run of weekly losses is its worst since 1986, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) ramped up production and sent it as low as $10 a barrel.

China\u2019s capital city ranked 69th out of the world\u2019s 140 most liveable cities in the Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s (EIU) semi-annual survey, released this week. The city was ranked higher than any other Chinese city, just ahead of neighbouring Tianjin where a massive explosion last week has left a toxic aftermath in its port area. \u201cBest joke of the week,\u201d said one user of Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter.  \u201cDid they get extra points for all the smog?\u201d asked another wag. The news came at the same time as new research, also published in the Economist, showed that breathing Beijing\u2019s air is the equivalent of smoking almost 40 cigarettes a day. Berkeley Earth\u2019s scientific director, Richard Muller, told the magazine that air pollution causes 1.6 million deaths a year in China, or 17% of the total. \u201cHow ironic is this?\u201d another Weibo user asked in response to the survey. \u201cPerhaps the news should have been published on 1 April.\u201d But Jon Copestake, editor of the EIU survey, said pollution was just one of more than 40 indicator scores that form the overall weighted score for cities. According to Copestake, many Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai received a score within the 70-80 band which implies day\u2013to\u2013day living is generally fine, but that some aspects of life may entail problems. \u201cThe category that pushes Beijing a bit higher than the others is education \u2013 which I think is a fair reflection of the higher quality institutions here,\u201d said Tom Rafferty, Asia economist for the EIU, in Beijing. \u201cIt also has, I would argue, more cultural options than most other Chinese cities, a wider range of consumer goods and services, better international transport links \u2013 all factors that go into the liveability rating,\u201d he added. Despite the online scorn, official data analysed by Greenpeace East Asia\u2019s Beijing office indicates the city has actually been experiencing more blue skies this year than in the first half of 2014. According to the data, Beijing\u2019s average levels of dangerous particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter, or PM2.5, has dropped 15.6%.       And in recent days Beijingers have been enjoying the kind of blue skies that only ever seem to accompany large-scale events in the capital. A number of anti-smog measures are being introduced to the capital in the lead-up to a huge parade on 3 September commemorating the end of the second world war. Twelve thousand troops are set to march through Tiananmen Square next month as part of the military parade and authorities are keen to have picture-perfect skies. According to state media agency Xinhua, \u201cpolluting factories will be closed, jobs which raise dust at construction sites will be suspended, and trucks carrying construction materials will be kept off the roads\u201d. But some measures, such as car restrictions, are clearly already in place as air quality index levels drop to as low as 25. Four out of five government vehicles will be taken off the road between now and the parade and private vehicles will be allowed on the roads only on alternate days, based on odd- and even-numbered license plates. Almost all steel mills in Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin are to be shut down in the lead-up to the military parade, Xu Xiangchun, chief analyst at Mysteel Research told Bloomberg last month. According to Xu, as much as 6 million tonnes may be cut, more than was lost last November when similar curbs were used for the Apec meeting of Asia Pacific leaders. But despite the blue skies, many Beijing residents may choose to stay inside as much of the city goes into lockdown. Many businesses have already closed their shutters and major roads and subways are to be shut down for the parade rehearsals. \u201cIt\u2019s good everything\u2019s shut,\u201d another Weibo user said in a comment on the closures. \u201cThat way we can all snuggle up at home in our \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019!\u201d Additional reporting: Amber Ziye Wang.", "tags": ["China", "Second world war", "Beijing", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-22T06:51:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/china-to-allow-pension-fund-to-invest-in-stock-market-for-first-time", "sentences": ["China has cleared the path for local authority pension funds to invest in the stock market for the first time, potentially channelling hundreds of billions of yuan into the country\u2019s struggling Shanghai exchange.", "Hopes that the Shanghai market will stabilise appear to be largely dependent on the Beijing authorities offsetting a run of weaker economic growth figures with moves to liberalise investment rules on state and private fund managers."], "title": "China to allow pension fund to invest in stock market for first time", "article": "China has cleared the path for local authority pension funds to invest in the stock market for the first time, potentially channelling hundreds of billions of yuan into the country\u2019s struggling Shanghai exchange. After a week of turbulence that sent world stock markets spiralling to their worst weekly loss for the year, Xinhua, the official news agency, reported on Sunday that under the new rules, the fund will be allowed to invest up to 30% of its net assets in domestically listed shares. The move, which is likely to be seen as a brazen attempt to inject pension cash into the market to shore up prices and restore investor confidence, comes ahead of several reports that are likely to show the world\u2019s major economies struggling to recover as China\u2019s main industries slowdown. A febrile atmosphere in currency and stock markets is also expected to persist as traders look ahead to gathering this weekend of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the focus will be on the Federal Reserve meeting next month to consider raising US interest rates for the first time since 2006.   Related: China syndrome: how the slowdown could spread to the Brics and beyond    Stock markets dived last week as the prospect of a rate rise combined with figures showing the Chinese economy growing at a slower pace than previously forecast unnerved investors. Fears that the Greek rescue deal would unravel following the resignation of prime minister Alexis Tsipras also weighed on investor sentiment. Britain\u2019s top 100 companies saw \u00a346bn wiped off their value on Friday, sending the FTSE 100 index down 10% since the beginning of the year. The New York Dow Jones crashed more than 500 points after investors in the Frankfurt Dax and Paris Cac sold heavily as they weighed up the likely negative impact of a shrinking Chinese market for their goods. Hopes that the Shanghai market will stabilise appear to be largely dependent on the Beijing authorities offsetting a run of weaker economic growth figures with moves to liberalise investment rules on state and private fund managers. Previously, Chinese pension funds could only invest in bank deposits and treasuries. Together the funds have assets of more than 2tn yuan ($322bn) that can be invested, meaning about 600bn yuan ($97bn) could theoretically go into the stock market, state media has estimated.  According to the new rules, pension funds can also invest in convertible bonds, money-market instruments, asset-backed securities, index futures and bond futures in China, as well as the country\u2019s major infrastructure projects.  Nevertheless, further turbulence is expected this week after a slump in oil prices that signalled a further slowdown in the global economy. World trade has declined in every month this year so far, indicating that businesses and consumers have become increasingly wary of committing themselves to expensive purchases. Eagerly awaited second-quarter gross domestic product figures for the US, due on Thursday, are expected to give a clue as to the strength of the world\u2019s largest economy.  In the eurozone, investors will also be looking at an German economic sentiment survey due on Tuesday for a better idea of the scope of the bloc\u2019s recovery. Preliminary August consumer price readings for Germany and Spain on Friday will provide further insight into how effective the European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying efforts have been at warding off deflation. But the spotlight will mainly fall once again on Greece, where early elections are expected to bring renewed uncertainty to the eurozone.  The latest bout of nervous trading followed a devaluation of the yuan by the Chinese authorities a fortnight ago. An initial 2% cut was followed by further devaluations until figures showing a 8.3% decline in exports were followed by a survey that pointed to a further weakening in manufacturing output growth  Analysts at Investec Economics said: \u201cIt will be all eyes on the Chinese authorities for any further policy support steps, alongside the People\u2019s Bank of China yuan fixings and trading swings.\u201d China is also widely expected to relax reserve requirements ratios for its banks again in the coming months, a measure intended to spur lending by reducing the cash they need to hold. It is trying to keep its economy on course to grow 7% in 2015 \u2013 its slowest pace in a quarter of a century. \u201cWe continue to expect a total of 100 basis points of reserve requirement ratio cuts by end-2015, with the first cut likely to take place within the next two weeks,\u201d economists at Standard Chartered said. The cash reserves ratio has already been cut three times this year.  Fed chair Janet Yellen is not expected to attend the Jackson Hole gathering, raising the prospect that other Fed officials may be more tight-lipped about the likelihood of the first rate increase in almost a decade, some analysts said. The prospect of an increase as soon as September receded this week as the Fed released minutes of July meeting. They gave no clear signals as to the timing of such a move - which would affect markets across the world and could cause more pain for emerging market assets, already being hit by China\u2019s woes.  Fed policymakers are still concerned about the weakness of the global economy, the minutes showed, but they were also more confident about US growth prospects.  \u2022 This article was amended on 25 August 2015 to correct the location of Jackson Hole.

Concern over the health of the global economy sent investors flocking to the yen \u2013 considered a \u201csafe haven\u201d \u2013 driving the US dollar to a six-week low against the Japanese currency. At noon, the dollar fetched 120.86-87 yen in Tokyo compared with 122.89-90 yen last Friday. The dollar\u2019s slide against the yen hit Japanese automakers and other exporters, which have benefitted from a steadily weakening yen over the past two years. Sony shares had fallen by 7.4% by midday, while Toyota\u2019s shares dropped 5.8%. After five weeks of losses, the Asia-Pacific region had been bracing itself for another tumultuous start to the week, with investor concern centred on China. Fears that China could drag down the global economy sparked the steepest one-day drop in nearly four years on Wall Street on Friday, and left the Dow Industrial Index more than 10% below its May record. Emerging economies that are highly dependent on exports to China are suffering from the Chinese manufacturing slowdown, analysts said. \u201cInvestors are taking a safety first approach to the stock market given the potential for instability related to capital flight from emerging economies,\u201d Ric Spooner, a market strategist for CMC Markets, said in a commentary.

They are now clinging to 5,000 points, levels not seen since July 2013. The indices had been close to breaching 6,000 points just four months ago. With more losses expected on Wall Street overnight, investors were braced for more heavy selling in the days to come.            The Australian dollar also hit a fresh six-year low of US72.01c as the continued fall in the price of key industrial commodities darkened the outlook for the resource-led Australian economy. A barrel of US crude oil now costs just $39.33 per barrel, the cheapest since early 2009 while copper and aluminium were also testing the lows last reached in the tailend of global financial crisis in June/July 2009.  Australian Stock Report head of research Chris Conway warned that the stock market falls could continue if it drops below 5,000 points. \u201cRight now, there is clearly some panic selling occurring and there is little in the way of technical support below the current market price,\u201d he said.       IG market analyst Angus Nicholson says this is now a key moment for China \u2013 its equity markets are in free fall, its banking system is short of liquidity and forecasts of 7% economic growth are now looking ambitious. \u201cThe most sensible way forward would seemingly involve further currency devaluation ... and stepped up fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said. The Australian market\u2019s losses were felt across the board \u2013 the energy sector dropped 6.2%, financials fell 4.6% and retailers shed 3.5%. But the respected Australian economist Saul Eslake said the concerns about China were overdone. The country\u2019s growing service industry was gradually overtaking the manufacturing sector as a share of GDP, he told Guardian Australia. The property market in the biggest cities was \u201cstabilising\u201d, he said, although the smaller cities were \u201cstill weak\u201d. And he believed that the recent devaluation of the yuan was not an attempt to stimulate flagging exports but was a genuine effort to reform the currency regime and to try to get ahead of any possible rate cut by the US Fed. \u201cIt\u2019s a move to be more flexible ahead of a Fed rate cut. The yuan is up 20% in trade-weighted terms so they wanted wriggle room if the Fed cuts rates and the US dollar rises. Despite attracting a lot of criticism for their handling of the crisis, the Chinese authorities might still have some policy levers left to pull. Any stimulus from Beijing would be a huge boost for Australian companies buffetted by the headwinds from the China slowdown.  Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals group was one of the biggest fallers on the ASX200 on Monday, with its shares plunging 14.62% after it announced annual profits were down 88%.

But clearly this kind of fall is substantial. It is a big event when a market falls by that amount in one day.\u201d Fraser Howie, the co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China\u2019s Extraordinary Rise, said Beijing\u2019s handling of the stock market calamity raised real questions about the leadership of president Xi Jinping and the prime minister, Li Keqiang. \u201cI think there is now growing realisation \u2013 domestically and offshore - that the Chinese leadership are not in control of the situation. Not only are they not in control of it, they don\u2019t even seem to grasp the problems at times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real casualty over the summer is the government\u2019s credibility. When you look at the stock market intervention, when you look at the FX botch as I would call it a couple of weeks ago, and then you look at the Tianjin blasts, you see a government that is most certainly not in control. You look at this and it sends a very poor picture about China\u2019s competency at the leadership level. Who else is responsible here? Xi Jinping seems invisible.\u201d \u201cThere are no short-term fixes for what China is going through,\u201d Howie added. \u201cThis is ultimately a painful unwinding of imbalances and leverage in the system and those processes are always tough and sore. It\u2019s a bit like saying what\u2019s a quick solution to my hangover? And that is exactly where China is at the moment. There are no quick solutions.\u201d Bernard Aw, a market analyst from IG in Singapore, said, \u201cThe risk sentiment is really on the verge of panic which is why we are seeing plenty of red screens. The Chinese stock market fell really spectacularly.\u201d Alex Kwok, an analyst at China Investment Securities in Hong Kong, told Channel News Asia: \u201cThis is already a small-scale stock market disaster. Any rebound, if there is any, could be just technical.\u201d China\u2019s Communist party leaders have launched an unprecedented push to prop up shares since June, injecting trillions of dollars into the stock market and setting up a market \u201cstabilisation\u201d fund. But yet another day of stock market chaos suggests investors have little faith in such measures and the wider prospects of the Chinese economy. Shanghai\u2019s Composite Index has now lost more than 35% of its value since June. Biswas, from IHS Global Insight, said the dramatic events of Black Monday underlined how Beijing\u2019s response to the continuing crisis had been timid and inadequate. \u201cIt has been piecemeal efforts through the course of the year with several small cuts in interest rates and some fiscal stimulus measures scattered around in recent months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen any decisive action and there is no sense of determination coming out of policy makers that they want to turn the economy around. \u201cWhat would need to be seen to be convincing is substantial further monetary policy easing. They don\u2019t have an inflation problem right now, therefore there is a lot of room to cut rates further and to use monetary policy stimulus \u2013 like cutting policy rates and by cutting the reserve requirement ratio \u2013 combined with fiscal policy stimulus measures. \u201cI think if they use a combination of those and also back that up with leadership at the economic policy level \u2013 by giving a convincing delivery of a stimulus package \u2013 then that might help to reassure not only Chinese domestic markets but also global markets, because increasingly the global outlook has been starting to deteriorate because of what is happening in China.\u201d In a research note UBS analysts warned: \u201cWorries that the world economy is losing momentum caused many investors to seek safety in government bonds and money markets. Investors should brace for further volatility.\u201d The latest rout came just a day after Beijing announced it would allow pension funds to invest in the stock market with immediate effect. The move was widely seen as an attempt to divert billions of dollars into the market to shore up prices.   Related: China to allow pension fund to invest in stock market for first time    China\u2019s state-run media has repeatedly vowed that the country\u2019s leaders will not allow such huge losses to continue. \u201cIn the future the market will not fall off a cliff,\u201d an editorial in the Shanghai Securities Daily said last month. \u201cThe government will not allow such a situation to happen again.\u201d The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has attempted to put a brave face on the economic situation. \u201cWe should be confident that economic growth still enjoys promising prospects,\u201d he told officials in north-east China last month.

We are just seeing that unfold now.

In January O\u2019Neill wrote in the Business Standard: \u201cMany international commentators remain bearish about China, expecting real GDP growth to slip significantly below 7%. The reasons cited usually involve some combination of excessive debt, inefficient lending, weaker export markets and consumers\u2019 ongoing inability to play a bigger role in the economy. \u201cI can think of at least three basic reasons to be bullish on China. First, the collapse of crude oil prices will boost consumers\u2019 real incomes, helping them play a larger role in the economy. Second, even though property prices have recently stalled and begun to fall, China will probably avoid a serious credit crunch, partly because Chinese policymakers have been more serious about restraining prices. A third reason to be optimistic is the subdued nature of inflation in China.\u201d  He went on: \u201cTaken together, these factors will make it easier for China to rebalance its economy \u2013 by raising wages, increasing property ownership rights for urban migrants and reforming pension systems. In 2016, when China \u2013 with its economy growing at 6 to 7% \u2013 chairs the Group of 20 nations, it can do so as a fully engaged member of the global economy.\u201d Perhaps best known for coining the acronym Bric to describe the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, O\u2019Neill spent 15 years at Goldman.

Financial markets in the west have been booming for the past six years at a time when the real economy has been struggling. Recovery from the last recession has been patchy and weak by historical standards, but that has not prevented a bull market in equities. The reason for this is simple: the markets have been pumped full of stimulants in the form of quantitative easing, the money creation programmes adopted by central banks as a response to the last crisis.  On the day that QE was launched in the UK, 9 March 2009, the FTSE 100 stood at 3542 points. Its recent peak on 27 April this year was 7103 points, a gain of 100.5%. There is a similar correlation between the three rounds of QE in the US and the performance of the S&amp;P 500, which was up more than 200% during the same period.   Related: Why is China's stock market falling and how might it affect the global economy?    But there were always doubts about what might happen when central banks decided it was time to remove some of the stimulus they have been providing for the past seven years. Now we know. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England halted their QE programmes and started to muse publicly about the timing of the first increase in interest rates.  At that point, financial markets merely needed a trigger for a big selloff. China has provided that, because the world\u2019s second biggest economy has shown distinct signs of slowing. What was inevitably dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d began in east Asia where there was disappointment that Beijing did not provide fresh support for shares in Shanghai overnight.  Having been accused of acting like quacks dispensing dodgy remedies on previous stock market rescue missions, China\u2019s leaders decided they would tough it out. Big mistake. The stimulus junkies needed a fix and when they didn\u2019t get one they had a bad dose of the shakes. Beijing will not make that mistake again. Policy will be eased and it will be eased quickly. The People\u2019s Bank of China has plenty of scope to cut interest rates and will use it. In the current circumstances, the long-term plan to rebalance the economy away from a reliance on exported manufactured goods, infrastructure and property speculation will be temporarily abandoned in favour of growth of any sort.  Whether it halts the stock market slide is another matter. Chinese policymakers have lost their aura of invincibility and are now in the awkward position of being damned if they do act and damned if they don\u2019t. Investors have started to scrutinise the Chinese economy in a far more forensic fashion and do not especially like what they see. Taking advantage of a more liberalised regime, capital is leaving the country. Dominic Rossi, of Fidelity Worldwide Investments, says what is happening in China and other emerging markets represents the third wave of of deflation for the global economy following the financial crash of 2008-09 and the eurozone crisis in 2011-12. Rossi says the deflation will be a double-sword: imports in the west will be cheaper but exports to emerging markets will be lower.           Analyst Max Wollf says despite the climb back in US stocks after a dramatic early selloff, there are still reasons to be concerned about the US markets and the Chinese economy     Following the six-year bull market, shares in London and New York do not look especially cheap. Corporate profitability will be hurt as companies are forced to match the price of cheaper imported goods. Larry Summers, a former US Treasury secretary, underlined fears that the crash could led to recession on Monday when he said the Fed might need to provide more stimulus. But, unlike in 2008, interest rates are already zero. Budget deficits mean governments have less scope to cut taxes or raise spending. China\u2019s total debt is four times what it was seven years ago. Central banks have pulled all the conventional policy levers and a few unconventional ones as well. They could shelve plans for interest rate rises and contemplate further rounds of QE, even though that amounts to doubling the dosage for drugs that become less effective every time they are administered.

Watching panic spread from Shanghai and Shenzhen to London and New York, western analysts grabbed for straws of understanding in unfamiliar fields, reflecting not only a professional need to look as if they know what\u2019s going on, but a psychological yearning to impose order on a wild, mercurial swing in the mood. There may be no single reason why August 2015 proved the moment for the world\u2019s investors to take collective fright about the People\u2019s Republic. What there is however, lurking under all the anxiety, is a single question for governments everywhere. Namely, what\u2019s left in the locker? Like a swaggering pre-crash financier, Beijing had grown to resemble a Master of the Universe. What it said more or less went; even the great crisis of 2008 caused only modest and impermanent departure from the course that it had set. But in recent months, the regime has been having to do ever more to achieve ever less. After inflating an extraordinary stock bubble, by enticing people of modest means into the market, the Communist rulers became visibly terrified of a burst. Restrictions were imposed on shares being sold off, while public bodies were sent on a buying spree. Instead of soothing nerves, these measures only stirred new concerns about why they had been necessary at all. Beijing\u2019s grip on events loosened again in the eyes of the world after it allowed the yuan to slide over the last fortnight. This might have been explained as a pragmatic adjustment to a slowdown at home after years in which a rising currency had eroded competitiveness overseas. Instead, there was spin suggesting that the move was all part of a well-laid plan, which succeeded only in alerting the world to the rate at which China had been burning through its vast reserves. That created such panic that further resources soon had to be spent on putting a floor under the slide. Beijing is certainly not out of options nor treasure just yet, and yet the world is losing its blind faith in the assumption that China\u2019s often-secretive political processes can in the end be relied on to steer the nation to ever-greater prosperity. The sheer scale of contemporary China\u2019s output is the most obvious reason why panic is spreading west \u2013 the world\u2019s second-largest economy can no longer be dismissed as a detail on the periphery \u2013 but size really shouldn\u2019t be everything when it comes to financial contagion. Relatively few British or even American companies rely heavily on exports to China, because it sells so much more to the west than it buys. As for those plunging shares in Shanghai, strict capital rules, aimed at encouraging domestic ownership also have the effect of limiting western exposure. Exotic instruments may have allowed some hedge funds to get up to their necks, but regular banks should not be embroiled as they were in 2008. What knocked 5% off European stocks yesterday was not the same sort of direct institutional linkage that existed between sub-prime mortgages in mid-western cities and bank accounts around the world, but rather a more diffuse \u2013 but nonetheless powerful \u2013 fear factor. At a time when the west is fretting about its own ability to power rapid economic progress \u2013 with technologists warning that the most transformative advances are in the past, and macroeconomists dreaming up theories of \u201csecular stagnation\u201d \u2013 the world\u2019s rising financial powers, of which China is by far the most important, have been a reliable glimmer of hope on the horizon. With that glimmer fading, the next slump suddenly feels that bit closer. Monday was a rollercoaster on Wall Street which ended badly, and the next slump could continue to haunt the markets, not least because everyone knows that it may not be possible to deploy the arsenal used in 2008. Interest rates have nowhere to go but up, nor does the oil price. National debts are already swollen, and while the printing presses could be cranked up again, there are increasing doubts about whether this achieves more than flattering asset prices \u2013 and delaying the reckoning. There were promises aplenty in 2008 about rebuilding the economy on firmer foundation stones, freeing western prosperity from its unhappy dependence on the whims of finance. But it hasn\u2019t happened. The result is that we\u2019ll all be even more exposed than before, in the face of any new storm that blows in from the east.", "tags": ["Chinese economy", "Stock markets", "China", "Economic policy", "Economics", "Economic recovery"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-24T18:49:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/osborne-china-stock-market-slide-derail-eu-economies-black-monday", "sentences": ["The UK chancellor said the volatility in China, where the main Shanghai Composite index on Monday had its biggest one-day drop since 2007, was \u201ca cause for real concern\u201d.", "Shares had soared in the previous 12 months \u2013 the Shanghai index climbing 150% in the that period \u2013 as individual investors were encouraged by cheaper borrowing costs to pile into the rising market.", "The sell-off intensified on Monday on disappointment that China\u2019s authorities had provided little in the way of fresh support over the weekend, with the Shanghai Composite sinking by nearly 9%."], "title": "Osborne plays down fears China stock market slide will derail EU economies", "article": "George Osborne has played down fears that European economies will be derailed by the dramatic stock market slide in China that triggered some of biggest swings at bourses around the world since the 2008 financial crisis.

As worries grow about a hard landing for China, the country\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply from a seven-year peak hit in mid-June, prompting Beijing\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, to admit that the country was facing a \u201cBlack Monday\u201d as another wave of selling hit investors.  Shares had soared in the previous 12 months \u2013 the Shanghai index climbing 150% in the that period \u2013 as individual investors were encouraged by cheaper borrowing costs to pile into the rising market. There had already been warnings that China\u2019s stock markets were overheating and no longer reflected true company values, nor the outlook for the Chinese economy, when heavy selling set in two months ago. Since then the market has tumbled 38%, further rattled this month by China\u2019s surprise devaluation of its currency, the yuan. The sell-off intensified on Monday on disappointment that China\u2019s authorities had provided little in the way of fresh support over the weekend, with the Shanghai Composite sinking by nearly 9%. That sent shockwaves through global marketsalready jittery on the back of more weak Chinese manufacturing figures last week, lingering concerns about near-bankrupt Greece and the prospect of an interest rate rise in the US. On stock markets, analysts talked about \u201cpanic selling\u201d as the big share indices experienced falls reminiscent of 2008. Almost \u00a374bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 index as it tumbled 4.7% to 5,898.9, the lowest for almost three years. The index posted its longest losing streak since 2003 as it fell for a 10th successive session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 fell more than 5%, wiping about \u20ac450bn (\u00a3331bn) off its combined market value in the worst one-day loss since late 2008 after the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers.  Underscoring market unease, the Vix volatility index, commonly viewed as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, hit its highest level since January 2009 at one point.  \u201cToday we have witnessed carnage as equity indices the world over fell like dominoes including the Dow Jones, falling a staggering 1,000 points shortly after opening,\u201d said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor.  \u201cFurthermore, China will have to brace itself for more pain with the dollar being pummelled beyond recognition as any chance of a rate hike this year goes out the window.\u201d Fears of waning demand from China, a vast consumer of energy and raw materials, also sent oil, copper and other commodities to multiyear lows. Emerging Asian currencies, including Malaysia\u2019s embattled ringgit and Indonesia\u2019s rupiah, were also at their lowest for years as investors dumped riskier assets.  \u201cAnything tied to commodities or emerging markets has been slapped to fresh multiyear or record lows as market participants shift to the havens of the euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc,\u201d said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First. Analysts said the sharp sell-off on world markets was not merely down to China and cited concerns that the global economy was losing momentum \u2013 while investors also braced for the first hike in US interest rates since they were slashed to near zero during the last financial crisis. But few were ready to say a fresh crisis loomed. \u201cThere was no single catalyst for the brutal sell-off,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at institutional investor BlackRock. \u201cThe spike in volatility is consistent with two trends: slower economic growth and deteriorating credit market conditions.  \u201cThat said, we don\u2019t think this is a prelude to another 2008-style cataclysm. Leading indicators are still positive and lower oil prices and interest rates should help stabilise growth.\u201d Although there are questions over how much the China\u2019s stock market reflects its real economy, the latest turmoil still raises important long-term questions about economic policy, experts said. \u201cIt is important not to overreact to stock market fluctuations, and China is likely to continue to grow at rates most European economies, including Britain, can only dream of,\u201d said Jonathan Perraton, senior lecturer in economics at the University of Sheffield. \u201cNevertheless, this may be one sign that the Chinese model that has been so successful since the late 1970s needs to adapt to new global economic circumstances.\u201d", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Chinese economy", "George Osborne", "Business", "Economics", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Commodities", "Currencies", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-24T19:14:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/dow-us-stocks-down-black-monday", "sentences": ["It was the biggest one-day drop on the Shanghai exchange since 2007."], "title": "Dow plunges after rollercoaster trading on \u2018Black Monday\u2019 for global markets", "article": "  Related: Asian stock markets fall again after Wall Street slump \u2013 live    Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off global stocks on Monday as a panic that started in China spread across the world on a day dubbed by China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, as \u201cBlack Monday\u201d.

The MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went up 1.7% after an initial dip to a three-year low. Policymakers in Japan called on Chinese authorities to take action to prevent further dramatic slides. The Shanghai Composite\u2019s falls continued despite a US$24bn injection of liquidity by China\u2019s central bank on Tuesday. Japan is concerned about the yen\u2019s rise against the dollar in recent days, as a stronger Japanese currency eats into the profits of Japanese automakers and other exporters. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said he hoped China would take action to stabilise its economy, but added that Tokyo had no immediate plans to introduce its own stimulus package. Aso later warned market players against pushing up the yen \u2013 seen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency\u201d \u2013 too much further, saying that its spike against the dollar overnight was problematic for Japan\u2019s economy.   Related: Asian stock markets recover amid wild swings after Wall Street slump \u2013 live    He said there were no plans as yet for co-ordinated action among G7 and G20 countries. \u201cI would say [the yen\u2019s rises overnight] are rough, rather than rapid,\u201d Aso said. \u201cFor the economy to grow stably, it\u2019s better for [currency and stock price] moves to be gradual and steady, rather than rough.\u201d The economics minister, Akira Amari, said the flurry of yen buying was proof of Japan\u2019s sound economic fundamentals, adding that it was up to the Bank of Japan to decide whether or not to ease monetary policy with more quantitative easing to force the yen back down. The yen surged nearly 5% to a seven-month high against the dollar on Monday as investors worried about the slowdown in China bought the relatively risk-free Japanese currency. The dollar rebounded to the upper 119 yen zone later on Tuesday in Tokyo. At noon the US currency fetched 119.86-87 yen after plummeting to as low as 116.15 yen in New York overnight. All eyes were on how Chinese markets would respond throughout Tuesday, amid reports that the country\u2019s leadership is running out of ideas to stabilise the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. China is facing a slowdown in economic growth, the banking system is short of cash and investors are pulling money out of the country. Chinese shares led Monday\u2019s market meltdown, plunging more than 8% to post their biggest losses since 2007. \u201cA co-ordinated policy response is critical and much of this needs to come from Asian economies,\u201d said Bernard Aw at IG Markets. \u201cA spate of better economic news may help to allay concerns that global growth is not deteriorating. Certainly improvements in the Chinese economy will be welcomed.\u201d Mark Williams of Capital Economics said investors were \u201coverreacting\u201d to the economic risks in China.  \u201cThe surge in prices that started a year ago was speculative, rather than driven by any improvement in fundamentals,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA combination of poor data and policy inaction in China may have triggered today\u2019s market falls but the bigger picture is that we are witnessing the inevitable implosion of an equity market bubble.\u201d Investors, worried that the Chinese economy is growing at a much slower pace than Beijing\u2019s 7% target for 2015, have also been spooked by uncertainty over US monetary policy. The heavy fall in share prices has tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, according to some analysts. \u201cThere seems to be no consensus with the Fed on whether they are worried about acting too prematurely or too late,\u201d said Toru Yamamoto, chief bond strategist at Daiwa Securities.

It was a pun too good to miss for the Daily Mail (page 1), the Sun and the Times. It kept company with the most used clich\u00e9 of the day, the one about China sneezing and the rest of the world getting a cold. In various guises, it appeared in the Guardian, Independent, Daily Express, Daily Mirror and the Sun. But the Sun deserves special mention for the pun over its editorial, Chinese burn. There was little to laugh about as the crop of large front page headlines illustrated: \u201cTrillion wiped off markets in day of panic\u201d (Times); \u201cBlack Monday risks a new financial crisis\u201d (Daily Telegraph); \u201cChina urged to end market turmoil\u201d (Guardian); \u201cMarkets take a plunge\u201d (Independent); \u201cShares crisis hammers pensions\u201d (Express) and \u201cGlobal stocks sell-off as China\u2019s \u2018Black Monday\u2019 darkens markets\u201d (Financial Times).  The seriousness of the situation was underlined in leading articles, although most sought to calm readers. The Times began by noting that markets had \u201cbehaved as if a crash similar to that of 1929 was looming\u201d and \u201cin the heat of the moment it seemed as if China had reached a tipping point and was going to take its trading partners down with it.\u201d But it said: \u201cThe turmoil is, despite the high dependency of the world\u2019s economies on the health of China, unlikely to start a slide towards apocalypse.\u201d It was unimpressed by \u201cclumsy Chinese government interventions\u201d and thought \u201cthe root of the crisis is the obscurity of Beijing\u2019s intentions and the true state of the national economy.

If the Chinese model really has run its course, the impact will be shattering. Yet the fundamentals that earned the label of the Chinese century are still largely in place.

Small wonder that stock markets are panicking.\u201d  The Financial Times also thought \u201cChina\u2019s initial reaction to the turmoil was less than impressive.\u201d It urged Beijing not to panic, arguing that it should \u201cthink hard about how it might boost consumption.\u201d The FT, as with others, demanded transparency:   \u201cIt should be public about its conclusions, however much this may go against the grain. Markets and the wider world need confidence in the existence of a plan, given the absence of the monetary and fiscal tools common to market economies.\u201d  The market plunge, said the paper, \u201cis a reminder that there are risks in investments and it is not the job of central bankers to protect the value of people\u2019s assets.

There are reasons for this. Capital has been leaving China at a rapid rate in recent weeks, and a big reduction in interest rates would have provided extra encouragement for investors to take their money elsewhere. The official line up until now has been that the Chinese economy is slowing in line with expectations rather than in the early stages of a full-blown recession. Slashing interest rates would have been seen as evidence that the economy was indeed suffering a hard landing and might have further damaged confidence. China wants to keep some of its powder dry. The statement issued by the PBoC, which talked about the downward pressure on the economy and the need to have more flexible policy tools to cope with the stock market blowout, reflects how concerned policymakers are about recent events.

Photograph: Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images    For many years Beijing came under fire for keeping the yuan low against the dollar to increase China\u2019s exports. But in recent years the yuan has appreciated in value, especially against the dollar, euro and yen. A fortnight ago Beijing shocked investors when it embarked on a forced devaluation. It argued that the move was part of its liberalisation programme \u2013 freeing the currency a little from central control. To prevent panic selling, it then used its financial muscle to buy yuan and stop it falling further. This week the yuan is 4.6% lower against the dollar and, according to many analysts, heading for a 10% cut over the next few months. Buying stock market funds China now has more than 90 million individual investors, a constituency that\u2019s larger than the membership of the Chinese Communist party. Cuts in interest rates and more relaxed lending rules introduced this year encouraged investors to storm the stock market, sending the Shanghai Composite index soaring by 150%. This bubble burst in June, and the spiralling market only came to rest after Beijing spent billions of yuan buying back stock and forcing state-owned industries to maintain cross-shareholdings.

Liberalising pension fund investment rules China\u2019s state pension funds have held government bonds in their portfolios of investments, but until now, equities were banned.

Cutting stamp duty Stock market traders are always complaining they pay too much tax on transactions. Governments tend to want shareholders to increase in number and to hold their investment for the long term. In this context, stamp duty provides a tidy tax income and a disincentive to trading for its own sake. On Tuesday the People\u2019s Bank said reforms, including a cut in stamp duty, were aimed at reducing \u201cthe social cost of financing to promote and support the sustainable and healthy developments of the real economy\u201d. Analysts said it was a quick fix to bolster a falling stock market.

The book received much acclaim, but it was also criticised by climate-change sceptics as extremist and alarmist. Since the book was published, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has completed two major summaries, in the form of its fourth and fifth assessment reports, and thousands of scientific publications have added to our understanding of how Earth\u2019s climate system responds to carbon pollution.  As a result, many details of climate science have been clarified. Not only are the scientific projections of major trends more certain than ever, but today many of us also have firsthand experience of living in a strongly shifted climate. With climate change an experienced reality, and the science verified, the room for climate change denialism keeps shrinking.    With climate change an experienced reality the room for climate change denialism keeps shrinking    Despite their vast increase in computational power, the models remain consistent in telling us that our Earth is warming, and will continue to warm in proportion to the volume of fossil fuel we burn. What has changed is the detail they reveal about the things that will unfold.  While no climate model can predict the future \u2013 simply because the future is impossible to predict \u2013 the increasing computational power of the models means that they are becoming ever more useful at explaining how climatic changes are being influenced by humanity. Studies of past climates are also becoming ever more informative. One that examines over 1,000 years of temperature records has shown that climate trends have sometimes differed markedly in the northern and southern hemispheres.  One example of hemispheric difference, which the sceptics used to cast doubt on the fact that CO2 causes warming, concerns the medieval warm period. The new study demonstrates unequivocally that this warm period was restricted to the northern hemisphere. But such is the unprecedented volume of greenhouse gases that humans have released into the atmosphere that the climate system is being overwhelmed, and today warming is occurring in both hemispheres. The contemporary world is changing fast; few changes have been as profound or disturbing as the increases in extreme weather experienced right across the planet. For that dwindling band who continue to deny anthropogenic climate change, this is the new battleground \u2013 albeit one which is becoming ever more difficult for them to defend.

Photograph: Mick Tsikas/Reuters    When, in late 2013, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott and his environment minister Greg Hunt argued that there is no link between the warming trend and extreme bushfires, they were arguing not only against science, but also contrary to common sense. The link between extreme weather and climate change is a critical area for public understanding, because it\u2019s the devastating extremes, rather than a shift in averages, that have the greatest impact. To deny the link also permits people to believe that climate change is something only for future generations to worry about. It is not.  Our climate has already changed, and over the last decade we have begun to witness more frequently the consequences of our profligate burning of coal, oil and gas. Very recent advances have allowed scientists to quantify the human impact on individual extreme weather events. Extremes in the weather are therefore a good place to begin looking at what has changed in climate science over the past decade.

Photograph: Fiona Hamilton/AP      The Rod Laver Arena had not been built to cope with the threat, and lives and money were put at risk    The Australian Open Tennis Championships are Melbourne\u2019s moment in the sun, and during the fortnight of the competition there\u2019s hardly another topic of conversation in the city. When, during the 2014 Open, a heatwave of unprecedented ferocity struck Melbourne, bringing a record-breaking four days in a row of temperatures over 41\u00b0C, as well as the city\u2019s hottest-ever 24-hour period, the stadium built to host the event turned into a furnace.  Despite the long and loud warnings of the climate scientists that extreme heatwaves were all but inevitable, Rod Laver Arena had not been built to cope with the threat, and lives and money were put at risk. With millions of dollars at stake, the tournament organisers were reluctant to call an end to play. For day after scorching day the players slogged it out in 40\u00b0C+ temperatures on the courts. The fans stuck around too, though more than 1,000 had to be treated for heat stress. Finally, the health risks to both players and spectators became too much, and the multi-million dollar tournament was suspended. In late 2014 Dr Thomas Knutson of the US Geophysical Fluids Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University, New Jersey, and colleagues published an analysis demonstrating that it is virtually impossible that the extreme heat experienced over Australia in 2013 could have occurred without the influence of human-emitted greenhouse gases. The analysis used a large series of computer models, some of which exclude human influence, while others include it. The Australian heat of 2013 was so extreme than in the 12,000 simulations generated by the models that included only natural factors, in all but one simulation it lay outside the range of probabilities.  Moreover, human influence tripled the odds that heatwaves that year would occur as frequently as they did, and doubled the odds that they would be as intense as they were. Our ability to link some kinds of extreme weather to climate change in this way is very new, and is likely to revolutionise our understanding of how we are influencing Earth\u2019s climate system. The average temperature of Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere has risen by just under 1\u00b0C during the past 200 years. How, you might ask, can such a small average increase have a large effect on extreme weather? There are several aspects that must be considered. One is that, because around 90% of the extra heat captured by greenhouse gases is transferred to the oceans, the oceans are warming dramatically. This alters evaporation, which influences the intensity of rainfall as well as the intensity of cyclones, and indeed the water cycle as a whole. But a second, more important, answer lies in the simple observation that if you plot weather for any location it looks like a bell curve.

Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPA    We will still experience some cold days in our warmer climate. But we will get many more hot days, as well as a number of record-breaking hot days.     Humanity\u2019s first intimation of just how great a threat to health heatwaves could become arrived in the summer of 2003    During the summer of 2013, more than 3,000 weather records were broken in the US, while 123 such records were broken in Australia (which has far fewer weather stations). In 2014 a further 156 records were broken in Australia. We\u2019re seeing the climate change before our eyes. A well-documented heatwave experienced in Melbourne in January 2009 shows in detail how heat affects health. After four days of high night-time as well as daytime temperatures, many people\u2019s bodies had become overstressed and unable to shed the excess heat. Mortality records reveal that, on average, around 90 people die annually in Melbourne between 26 January and 1 February.  But during the heatwave of 2009, 374 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d were recorded, the great majority occurring after four days of the extreme heat. Bushfires and hurricanes might gain the headlines, but it\u2019s easy to understand why doctors have come to dread what they call \u201cthe silent killer\u201d. Heatwaves have, of course, always occurred. The dustbowl-era American heatwave of 1936 was the hottest on record until 2012. The great Chicago heatwave of 1995, which killed about 600 people, occurred as greenhouse gas concentrations were beginning to climb, and so may have been influenced by climate change. But it was only with the arrival of the century that our shifting climate began to influence heatwaves strongly.  Humanity\u2019s first intimation of just how great a threat to health heatwaves could become arrived in the summer of 2003. Europe\u2019s summer that year was the hottest since records began in 1540. The most severe conditions were felt in France, and by August \u2013 the traditional time for summer holidays \u2013 parts of the country were sweltering in record heat. With their families at the seaside, many elderly people had little support for coping with the extreme conditions, a situation made worse by the lack of preparedness by authorities. Because heatwaves had not been considered a major threat, many aged-care facilities lacked air conditioning. Remarkably, though, the residents of nursing homes did better than the more capable elderly living alone at home. With nobody to help them, it was the \u201cfit elderly\u201d who experienced the worst mortality rate, succumbing to overheating, dehydration and heart and lung failure.      Patients being treated at a hospital in Versailles near Paris, during the heatwave that hit France in 2003. Photograph: Martin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images    In France, nearly 15,000 heat-related deaths resulted in a severe overload of mortuary facilities, and a refrigerated warehouse outside Paris was used as temporary storage. Across Europe, more than 70,000 people died of the heat. At current rates of warming, by mid-century the conditions seen in the 2003 European heatwave are set to become the annual summer average. In Australia, heatwaves are hotter, last longer and come earlier than ever before. The number of hot days (above 35\u00b0C) across the country per year has doubled in the last 50 years, and the annual number of heatwaves has doubled in Perth. In Adelaide, heatwaves last an average of two days longer than they did 50 years ago, while in Melbourne the heatwave season is starting 17 days earlier. In 2014, Adelaide experienced 13 days over 40\u00b0C (the average is currently two), a number expected for the average summer by 2030.    The number of hot days in Australia per year has doubled in the last 50 years    In the last few years, record-breaking heatwaves have been felt from Shanghai to Texas. In the US in 2011\u20132012, the number of intensive heatwaves was almost three times the long-term average, with the 2011 Texas heatwave and the 2012 heatwave in the Midwest both breaking temperature records.  Akin in their extremity to the Russian heatwave of 2010, they give some intimation of the conditions scientists predict are likely to be felt towards the end of this century in the US if we don\u2019t rein in emissions. As heatwaves become hotter, longer and more frequent, there\u2019s an inevitable impact on bushfires. While the relationship is not as simple as that between rising average temperatures and heatwaves, it is clear enough. Three things are necessary for a bushfire to rage \u2013 enough fuel, a source of ignition, and the right weather. Sufficient fuel exists much of the time at many locations, and sources of ignition, from dropped cigarette butts to lightning strikes, are ever present.  So, as common sense suggests, the right weather conditions are the key factor in determining how severe a bushfire will become. Few places are as bushfire prone as southeastern Australia, and the most severe and damaging fire in the nation\u2019s history provides a clear picture of how climate change is influencing fire risk.

Photograph: Handout/Getty Images    The people of Victoria will not soon forget the conditions they awoke to on 7 February 2009. For a decade, drought had ravaged Australia, and almost no rain had fallen in Victoria in the preceding two months. A heatwave had killed hundreds in the previous week, and temperatures were predicted to peak at 47\u00b0C that afternoon. Add to that a scorching southern-hemisphere northerly wind blowing at 100 kilometres per hour, and it was clear to everyone that this would be a day of dread. Despite all the warnings and preparations, the thousand fires that broke out that day across the state would take 173 lives, almost half of them children. Under the extreme conditions that day, fire began to behave in ways never seen before. The speed of its spread and the intensity of its impact took almost everyone by surprise.     Australian newspaper front pages from Febuary 2009, showing the devastating aftermath of the Victorian bushfires.  Photograph: Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images    The Black Saturday fires, as they became known, were Australia\u2019s most deadly bushfires, and among the 10 worst ever recorded worldwide. In their wake, official advice about what to do when bushfires threaten has been drastically rewritten. Before Black Saturday, official advice was often to stay and defend your property. Afterwards, officials now warn residents to evacuate as soon as the announcement is made, which is often long before a fire reaches an area. It turns out that at almost every step along the way, climate change had some influence on the severity of the Black Saturday bushfires. In Victoria, lightning strike typically accounts for about 25 per cent of all bushfire ignitions but, because bushfires started by lightning often burn in rugged areas and are difficult to put out, such fires account for around half of all land lost to bushfires in the state. And with every degree Celsius of warming experienced, lightning activity increases 5\u20136%. The amount of fuel available to a fire can be influenced by climate cycles, which themselves are affected by climate change. Extreme rainfall can promote plant growth, and a long dry spell can then cure it and make it ready for burning. But by far the greatest influence of a changing climate on bushfires are short-term weather events, such as heatwaves. As one climate scientist put it, \u201cclimate change is increasing the frequency and severity of very hot days and driving up the likelihood of very high fire danger\u201d.    At almost every step along the way, climate change had some influence on the severity of the Black Saturday bushfires    In Australia, while the projections regarding future bushfire activity are not detailed, most analyses indicate an increase in the fire danger index as temperatures increase. Another issue that is likely to have a large impact is that, as the fire season lengthens, the opportunities to control fires through hazard-reduction burning are decreasing. This leaves communities under threat of high fuel loads in an extended fire season.  Fire crews are already finding the longer fire season a challenge. A few decades back they could work together and stage their efforts to meet the fire challenge as it unfolded sequentially across the continent from north to south. Now, they scramble to meet extreme conditions that may erupt in a number of states simultaneously. All of this puts the public at heightened risk of yet another silent killer. Each year, more than 300,000 people die worldwide from inhaling smoke from forest fires. As the fire risk grows, the threat to life will worsen. In the western US, for example, organic carbon aerosol (a component of smoke) concentrations are expected to increase by 40 per cent by 2050. Smoke from forest fires can threaten the health of people far from the fire front. During July 2002, forest fires in Quebec resulted in an up-to 30-fold increase in airborne fine particle concentrations in Baltimore, a city nearly 1600 kilometres downwind. These fine particles are extremely harmful to human health and affect both indoor and outdoor air quality. Human health can also be directly impacted by the burning of fossil fuels. In northern China, air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, principally coal, is causing people to die on average 5.5 years sooner than they otherwise might. It\u2019s not just the particles produced by burning coal that are deadly.  As Earth warms, more ozone is created at ground level, and ozone, when combined with fumes from burning fossil fuels or from wildfires, creates photochemical smog. Almost anyone living in a city will be familiar with the brown haze that results, and those who are young, asthmatic, old or suffering from lung or heart disease will know firsthand of its health impacts. As Earth warms, the problem is bound to increase, and the health effects will be compounded by other factors, including allergies. The increase in heavy downpours resulting from climate change is also affecting health, through promoting an increase in the growth of mould. This compounds lung diseases, allergies and asthma. Heavy rains can also overwhelm drainage systems, causing exposure to sewerage and toxic chemicals that add to other climate related health issues.    As Earth warms, health problems are bound to increase, and the health effects will be compounded by other factors    Just whose health is most at risk from such impacts has been assessed in a recent Australian report. Those living in remote areas, including Indigenous communities, low-income earners, the elderly, children, those who work outdoors, those with existing medical conditions, and tourists (who do not appreciate how extreme local conditions can become) are all at elevated risk.  Perhaps the most surprising health impact of climate change was revealed by a study published in Nature. It documented how increasing atmospheric CO2 was degrading the nutritional value of crops, especially in Asia. Zinc, iron and protein levels are all falling in wheat and rice, and at least two billion people depend on rice for their iron and zinc.     Farmers Work In Paddy Fields In Srinagar. With less rainfall in several parts of India this monsoon, many fear drop in production of rice and other crops.  Photograph: Hindustan Times/Hindustan Times via Getty Images    Finally, to all such impacts must be added the mental illnesses caused by stress. Losing your home to a bushfire supercharged by a warming climate is traumatic, as is being flooded out, or losing your crop. Health workers are noting an uptick in people whose mental health is being affected in many ways due to our changing climate. Looking beyond 2050, it becomes more difficult to assess risks to human health. But one thing is clear. The impacts of increasing temperatures upon human health are not linear. In a world in which temperatures are 4\u00b0C warmer than the pre-industrial base, we are likely to see health impacts many times more severe than those which will prevail in a world 2\u00baC warmer.

These figures relate not to the Shanghai Composite index in August 2015 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average in October 1929.  Even in the most savage bear markets prices never fall in a straight line. Instead, within a downward trend big daily falls are punctuated by sizeable daily rallies. Events of the past few days conform to this pattern, at least in Europe. Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris fell heavily on Friday and Monday, then recovered on Tuesday. For a good while, there was every indication that New York would follow the same pattern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 400 points at one stage only to suffer a bout of jitters in the last hour of trading to close more than 200 points lower. This is a bad omen. Markets were not over-impressed when China hit the panic button by both cutting interest rates and allowing banks to lend more money. Wall Street\u2019s late loss of nerve suggests there is a lot more turbulence to come, with attention firmly focused on China, where the authorities have given up intervening to prop up the stock market in favour of intervening to prop up the economy.   The Dow Jones in 1929   The statement issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China pointed out that economic growth was facing \u201cdownward pressure\u201d, and there will be further easing over the months to come as the weaknesses of China\u2019s economic model become apparent.  It is not just that the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy is faltering, it is that the quality of that growth is deteriorating.  Mike Riddell of M&amp;G notes that the share of gross domestic product accounted for by investment rose from just over 40% in 2007, to 48% between 2008 and 2013, to 54% last year. A higher investment rate is normally associated with higher growth; in China\u2019s case it has been associated with lower growth.  Riddell\u2019s conclusion is that much of the investment has been wasteful and that China is \u201ctrying to hit unsustainably high GDP growth rates by generating bigger and bigger credit and investment bubbles\u201d.

Photograph: Rex    The stock market bubble has now well and truly popped and the rebalancing of the economy away from over-investment has not yet begun. China\u2019s leaders cannot stave off a hard landing for ever. Indeed, the hard landing may already have arrived. This financial crisis is not over. The question is what impact it will have on the global economy. Optimists point to three reasons to be cheerful.    Related: US and European markets bounce back as China crisis continues    The first is that the risks of financial contagion from China\u2019s stock market crash to the rest of the world are limited, because most losers will be Chinese companies and Chinese individuals. That\u2019s unlike the crash of 2007, when the whole world had bought into the US sub-prime boom. The second is that almost every recession since the second world war has been preceded by a sharp rise in oil prices, yet in the past year the cost of crude has more than halved. Third, the last really serious emerging market crisis in 1997 had no discernible impact on developed nations. Such optimism may be a bit premature. For a start, emerging markets are now a bigger part of the global economy. China represents 17% of world GDP once differences in the cost of living between rich and poor countries are evened out, and has accounted for almost 30% of global growth since 2010. The low oil price reflects the fact that some big emerging market economies are in recession and are exporting that recession to the west.  Finally, developed countries responded to the 1997 crash by slashing interest rates. That option is unavailable this time.

It occupies 200,000 square miles, and stretches from Montana and North Dakota across into Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada. In the past five years, there has been a dramatic influx of people in North Dakota.

The Holiday Inn ... that went up faster than anything.\u201d Williston has been a farming town since the mid-1900s, when many Norwegians arrived in the region to profit from the Homestead Acts, which allowed new settlers to own some land at little or no cost.  When we visit, downtown Williston was celebrating Norwegian Constitution Day with traditional music and cakes. There, local resident Adrienne Stepaneck acknowledges that the oil is a blessing. \u201cI try to be positive, I know so many millionaires, I can be generous to my children and grandchildren.

Photograph: Dan Dennison    On the drive from Williston to Watford, there are new roads stretching across the plains, and more are being built. Traffic cones divide up the highway and workmen slow traffic, whilst others lay the new surfaces. There is a regular and constant stream of trucks and lorries transporting oil, sand and water for the fracking process.  Jason Kane, a pipeline worker from Arizona, arrived two years ago after his wife ran off with his son\u2019s soccer coach. Because he needs to pay off his debts, Jason works six days a week.

She wants a good life for her daughter and she knows there is money to be made, but being a woman makes things harder. During our trip, Jennifer told us she was stalked and harassed by her boyfriend, who has since been arrested and charged; he is now awaiting trial. She admitted that this wasn\u2019t the first time her boyfriend, an oil worker, had been charged with grievous bodily harm.

Developers are coming to town despite the slowdown, and Main Street is seeing a complete regeneration from the sewers and drainage up to street level.  King mentions the new housing developments being built: \u201cThere is a big Shanghai development going up; it plans to house 2,000 people. Watford City only had a population of 1,700 people before the latest boom.\u201d He is less positive about the development of these cities than Wenko: \u201cAll of a sudden, North Dakota is famous, like they just won the lottery and now they\u2019re being stupid. It\u2019s like capitalism on steroids up here. I am making a living, but I\u2019m not a fan of big oil.\u201d But Travis Cooksey tells me how coming to Williston has turned his life around. Back home in California, he and his wife were living in an RV park with \u201cIRS debt, navy debt and standard debt\u201d, he had two weeks left in the military and no job to go to when they decided to make the move. In five years, Travis has paid off his debt and bought a three-bedroom house for his family.  A frontier town and the wild west Chuck Wilder, a local historian, runs the Broadway Bookshop. The shop is a local hub and people wander in and out to hear him speak, as much as buy the books. A couple of local men of Norwegian heritage sit in a booth, singing and playing the blues. There is a sense of the old town in here. Chuck shows a woman from the local paper some family memorabilia, an original letter written in 1887 by a young boy to his mother, informing her of the building of \u201ca new town called Williston\u201d. There\u2019s a self-awareness in the bookshop, a sense of history and a deep connection with the land. This quiet, cultured interior appears in stark contrast to the man-made world outside. And yet the shop, like this town, was also founded on opportunity and a desire for progress. For many this is place is still temporary \u2013 a place to make a quick buck before heading home. But this approach is becoming harder with the slowdown: people are finding it more difficult to get work in oil and more people are turning to service jobs, which are growing fast to provide for the rapidly increasing population.

But seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers brought down the global financial system and plunged half the world into a slump, it\u2019s scarcely alarmist to see the financial panic as the harbinger of a new crisis in a still crippled world economy.   Related: China 2015: beware the links with 1929    The market gyrations that followed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d this week and the 40% drop in the value of Chinese stocks since June have only underlined the fragility of what is supposed to be an international recovery. For all the finger-wagging hubris of western commentators over the fact that the latest mayhem has erupted in China, this is a global firestorm. And after three decades of deregulation punctuated by financial crises and a systemic meltdown, there is every reason to fear more fallout from casino capitalism. Financial markets pumped up with credit and quantitative easing to keep the real economy afloat are in any case ripe for a crash \u2013 or \u201ccorrection\u201d, as the market players like to call it. The only question is how far and fast they go \u2013 and how great is the price paid by the rest of us. Paradoxically, Beijing may be better placed than others to ride out this storm. China\u2019s economy is slowing down, as it shifts from export-led growth to consumption. But it\u2019s still growing at 7%, nearly three times as fast as Britain and the US, which are supposed to be the west\u2019s current star performers. Even if China\u2019s figure is overstated, its growth is still at least double the Anglo-American rate: the kind of economic problem the rest of the world would be happy to have. That follows three decades when Chinese growth averaged 10% a year, delivering the fastest economic development and reduction in poverty in world history \u2013 as well as rising inequality and environmental degradation. But China\u2019s stock market is small compared with its western equivalents and relatively insulated from the rest of the economy.           How worried should we be about China\u2019s stock market turmoil? Link to video     Despite its huge private sector, China is still a hybrid economy, dominated by state banks and publicly owned corporations. That means its financial system is shielded from the impact that a stock market crash on this scale would have in a western-style private banking system. China rode out the 2008 crash by pumping public investment into the economy, delivering 78% growth between 2007 and 2014, while the US managed 8%. That has left it with a huge debt pile, estimated at 282% of national income, which some now believe will bring China\u2019s economy to a juddering halt. But that is mostly debt between state-owned institutions, so there is no basis for a speculative Lehmans-type collapse. In fact, some of the problems China is now facing as it tries to bring the stock market crisis under control, such as capital outflow, stem from the liberalisation urged on it by the World Bank and its own home-grown would-be oligarchs.    There is every reason to fear more fallout from casino capitalism    China\u2019s room for manoeuvre would certainly be much narrower if it had gone for their full deregulation and privatisation package. But the main drag on the Chinese economy isn\u2019t the failings of its own economic model, but stagnation in the rest of the world. Global trade suffered its largest contraction since 2008 in the first six months of this year, partly as a result of the ongoing crisis in the eurozone. Eight years after the financial crisis erupted in the US, its aftershocks are still being felt across the world. A dysfunctional model of capitalism, built on deregulation, privatisation and low wages, crashed and burned seven years ago. But the fallout from that crisis is still ricocheting around the world, from Europe to the \u201cemerging economies\u201d, as the attempt to refloat a broken model with cheap credit inflates asset bubbles and share buybacks \u2013 or enforce it with austerity \u2013 fuels new crises. That is what has been played out across financial markets this week, in which China has been a transmission belt rather than the motor. Any idea that the western economies that generated stagnation have been fixed is not serious. Their recoveries have been the slowest on record and interest rates remain at a historic low \u2013 because owners of capital are prepared to invest in anything except the productive economy. The likelihood must be that this stagnation continues indefinitely, punctuated by financial upheavals.

The near 23% fall in the index over the past seven days is the biggest weekly fall since 1996, and dwarfs the 12.8% weekly fall that occurred in July.  And as often happens, the rest of the world\u2019s stock exchanges followed. The London stock exchange fell 7.4% in two days before slightly recovering, the Dow Jones index in New York fell 9.7% on four days, before recovering 4% today.  Here in Australia, the All Ordinaries index fell 4% on Monday before recovering 2.6% on Tuesday and a further 0.6% on Wednesday.  In July, the Chinese authorities tried to stem the bleeding by halting trading on half of the stocks, preventing short-selling (whereby traders buy options on stocks in the future at a lower price than they currently are selling for \u2013 in effect betting their price will fall), and also getting the state-owned wealth fund to start buying shares.    Related: How China's economic slowdown could weigh on the rest of the world    This time round the sense is not so much that the market needs to be assisted, as it is the Chinese economy that needs help.  Reflecting the concerns of investors around the world that China\u2019s economy is slowing by more than anticipated, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) on Tuesday cut the benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.6%:       This was the fourth cut in the past year. The PBoC also lowered the required reserve ratio (RRR) for banks to 18%. This followed a lowering of the RRR in April. The relaxing of the RRR essentially allows Chinese banks to lend more and together with the lowering of the interest rates Beijing hopes to stimulate the economy.   It did little to calm investor\u2019s nerves. On Wednesday the Shanghai composite index went on a wild ride. At one point it was down as much as 3.2% before rising 4.2% on the back of intervention by state-owned banks, before finishing the day down 1.3%.  Of course we need a bit of context before we get too carried away with our panic.  The fall being experienced in China over the past three months is sharper, but not as severe as that which occurred during the GFC. From October 2007 to Jun 2008, the Shanghai index lost 54% of its value:       But the difference back in 2007 was that the Chinese economy grew by 14%, and even in 2008 with the GFC it still grew by 9.6%. Currently the IMF expects China\u2019s GDP to grow by 6.8% this year and just 6.3% in 2016.  Certainly there is the sense that what is happening in the Chinese stock exchange is a \u201ccorrection\u201d \u2013 which is a fancy and hopefully not too scary way of saying that the market was massively overvalued.  Despite the recent large fall, the Shanghai index remains 32% above where it was 12 months ago. But that massive growth occurred during a period when Chinese growth was being downgraded.  It was growth that didn\u2019t match at all what was happening in the Chinese economy. In mid-to-late 2014, Chinese real estate prices slumped. They have begun to recover somewhat, but the recovery is pretty spotty. The latest figures released yesterday show the prices of newly constructed commercial residential buildings declined in 29 of the 70 major cities and increased in 31:        Such news had Joe Hockey yesterday morning trying to suggest things were OK. He told ABC Breakfast \u201cthe fundamentals in China are gradually improving ... for example, the Chinese property market is showing signs of recovery\u201d. He also suggested the moves by the PBoC to cut interest rates and relax the RRR was \u201canother positive step to help the Chinese economy\u201d.  Of course the Chinese government is only doing such things because it is worried that the \u201cfundamentals\u201d are not actually \u201cgradually improving\u201d.  One other way to get some context for the fall in the Chinese stock market is to compare its performance over the past six-and-a-half years with that of the US and Australian stock markets.  Since February 2009, which was when the stock market around the world bottomed out during the GFC, the Dow Jones index in America has risen 121% (prior to the recent fall it was up 150%). The Australian stock exchange\u2019s All Ordinaries index, by contrast, is just up 56% in that period. But when we look at the Shanghai index, the boom of the past 12 months becomes very clear:       In June last year, the Shanghai Composite index was virtually the same as it was in February 2009. Within a year it would rise 122%. Now it sits at just 40% above where is was at the bottom of the GFC \u2013 a performance even worse than Australia\u2019s market.  Clearly, unless something magical in China\u2019s economy had happened in the past 12 months, there was no solid reason for such a boom. Unlike in 2007 when the Chinese stock market boomed (and then bust with the GFC), economic growth was strong.  This latest boom came via margin lending from investors seeking returns that were no longer coming elsewhere \u2013 especially the real estate market.  It had unsustainable written all over it because there was no real economic reason for such an optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy.  The IMF\u2019s latest report on China is headlined: \u201cChina\u2019s transition to slower but better growth\u201d. \u201cBetter\u201d is a rather nice positive spin, but any time you hear talk of \u201cslower growth\u201d you would not assume to see that nation\u2019s stock market going wild.  Of course there is not always a link between economic performance and the stock market. The Dow Jones index might be massively outperforming Australia\u2019s stock market, but since the start of 2009, Australia\u2019s economy has easily outperformed that of the USA:       But as for China, the outlook, regardless of the performance of the stock market, is for lower growth than we have been used to (and have taken advantage of).  The minister for trade, Andrew Robb tried to put some very optimistic spin on the falling Chinese stock market by suggesting Chinese investors may look to Australia as a safe haven.  Robb said he expects the falling stock market \u201cwill accelerate the level of investment inquiries coming into Australia across all sorts of areas of activity\u201d. But this is unlikely and certainly not something being anticipated on the foreign exchange market. The value of the Australian dollar has fallen over 7% on the past two months, to a six-year low of $US0.718.        That doesn\u2019t happen when investors are clamouring to get into the Australian market. The reality is China\u2019s stock market has fallen because growth in the overall Chinese economy is falling and a stock market and an economy can only stay disparate for so long.  The impact of the Chinese stock market on Australia will not be great \u2013 aside from impacts on our stock market \u2013 but the slowing Chinese economy, and the demand for goods and services from Australia will continue to drag on our own economic growth.

Robb\u2019s offer provides a potential avenue for resolving political disagreement over the contents of the agreement, as Labor weighs up the option of blocking the enabling legislation if the government refuses to increase \u201csafeguards\u201d for Australian jobs. But the scope for a breakthrough is narrow because the government appears determined not to revisit the text of the agreement. Labor\u2019s trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, urged the government to follow the lead of the former prime minister John Howard, who was prepared to sit down with the Labor party in 2004 to discuss additional safeguards for the contentious free trade agreement with the US. Guardian Australia asked Robb whether he was prepared to sit down with Wong to discuss options for getting the enabling legislation through parliament. In response, Robb said he was \u201cmore than happy to constructively engage with Senator Wong\u201d. It is understood Robb and Wong have already had talks. While there might be some room to move on the yet-to-be-released enabling legislation, the government does not want to budge on the text of the agreement, setting up a high-stakes political standoff. Enabling legislation makes any changes to Australian laws that are needed to bring into effect a free trade agreement. Not all aspects of the China deal require legal changes, but a failure to pass the enabling legislation would sink the agreement. In the case of the US free trade agreement, the then Labor leader Mark Latham made his support for the deal conditional on amendments to protect the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Howard suggested the changes were unnecessary and raised concern that they might be inconsistent with the spirit of agreement but \u201cdecided that the commonsense thing to do is to support the amendments\u201d. Robb, who has travelled to Beijing and Shanghai this week to assure his Chinese counterparts about the government\u2019s commitment to the deal, said the legal text of the treaty had been signed off \u201cand it will not be reopened\u201d. If the talks between Robb and Wong fail to produce a compromise, Labor would face a big choice about whether to seek to block the enabling legislation in the Senate. Labor\u2019s leadership faces significant pressure from its industrial base \u2013 with unions running advertising campaigns against the foreign-worker provisions \u2013 and from caucus members who are uneasy about the contents of the deal. The government would also be making a big call if it refused to budge because it would risk having to negotiate with the disparate group of crossbench senators to salvage the deal, a difficult proposition on such a significant trade agreement. A spokeswoman for Wong declined to say whether Labor was prepared to vote against the relevant bills if the party\u2019s requests were not met, but indicated it would \u201cconsider the enabling legislation when it is presented to the parliament later this year\u201d. \u201cLabor welcomes Mr Robb\u2019s belated acknowledgement of concerns about the China free trade agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a demonstration of good faith Mr Robb should cease name-calling anyone who questions his deal and abandon his plan to spend $25m of taxpayers\u2019 money promoting it.\u201d The prospect of talks comes amid an intense political tussle over aspects of the deal relating to foreign workers. Coalition MPs have reported that the union campaigns and automated phone calls are starting to resonate with voters. Tony Abbott ramped up his rhetoric last week, accusing Labor of being \u201chaunted by the ghost of the white Australia policy\u201d. The prime minister further accused the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, of being \u201csilent in the face of racism\u201d by not disowning the CFMEU\u2019s \u201ccampaign of xenophobic lies\u201d against the China deal.  In one CFMEU advertisement, a family discusses the free trade agreement. \u201cTony Abbott stuffed it up,\u201d the father says. \u201cHe\u2019s letting Chinese companies bring in their own workers \u2026 they don\u2019t even have to advertise the jobs \u2026 sorry but you won\u2019t even get a look-in, son.\u201d Labor and the unions have suggested the agreement does not protect labour market testing \u2013 that is, a requirement that companies look for local workers before seeking workers from overseas. They have pointed to the process for Chinese-backed companies to bring overseas workers to Australia for projects worth at least $150m, noting the memorandum of understanding says \u201cthere will be no requirement for labour market testing\u201d to enter into an investment facilitation arrangement (IFA). The government contends the criticism is disingenuous because the same document refers to labour market testing by the direct employers after the overarching IFA has been approved. The government says employers will not be permitted to bring in overseas skilled workers unless there is clear evidence of a genuine labour market need, as determined by the immigration department. Labor and the unions have also pointed to chapter 10 of the free trade agreement relating to temporary entry for business visitors, managers, specialists, and people who install and service machinery and equipment. The document says \u201cneither party shall \u2026 require labour market testing, economic needs testing or other procedures of similar effect as a condition for temporary entry\u201d. Unions have also slammed Robb\u2019s commitment to \u201cstreamline\u201d skills assessment processes for Chinese applicants for 457 visas. In a letter the minister said Australia would \u201cremove the requirement for mandatory skills assessment\u201d for electricians, joiners, carpenters and several other occupations. Robb has defended the move, saying people would still have to show they were \u201cverified with organisations that our own trade skills organisations acknowledge\u201d.

Maybe you can\u2019t, but the world\u2019s policymakers are giving it their best shot. Let\u2019s just consider the context. During August there was a big sell-off in shares amid concerns that the Chinese economy was in trouble. The declines, however, followed a long bull market in which prices were supported by the quantitative easing programmes pursued by central banks rather than by underlying economic strength. A true believer in free markets would have seen the recent sell-off as both inevitable and healthy. But financial markets are by no means free. They are, on the contrary, one of the last bastions of socialism left on earth. Everything possible is done to boost asset prices and when overstimulation leads to bubbles bursting it is all hands to the pump to prevent them from falling too far. So, in the last couple of days we have seen the chief economist of the European Central Bank musing openly about the possibility of additional QE. We have had the president of the New York Federal Reserve dropping the biggest possible hint that an interest rate rise will be delayed. And we have had the authorities in Beijing buying up shares on the Shanghai stock market. And guess what? It has worked. Shares have been going up around the world because investors have been given guarantees that they will be protected from the consequences of their own folly. Despite the upward revision to US growth figures, all that Wall Street needs to do to prevent a Fed rate rise is to have another flash crash between now and mid-September. The Fed will then back off. If things get really bad, it will need to consider a fourth dose of QE. Yes, really. George Saravelos, of Deutsche Bank, says there is a reason western central banks, starting with the ECB and the Bank of Japan, might need to again resort to the electronic printing presses: China\u2019s use of its foreign exchange reserves to defend the external value of the yuan. Effectively, China has been selling a chunk of its holdings of foreign bonds, such as US Treasuries. QE involves buying bonds, so what the People\u2019s Bank of China has been doing is QE in reverse or, as Saravelos puts it, quantitative tightening or QT. Ostensibly, QT has always been part of the plan. When central banks embarked on their asset-buying programmes, the intention was that they would be sold back to the markets when things had returned to normal. The problem is that things have never returned to normal and, judging by recent events, never will. Zero interest rates were supposed to be temporary. They are now the norm. QE was an unconventional measure for use in an emergency only. It is here to stay, albeit subject to the law of diminishing returns. Clearly then, you can buck the market. Corrections can be delayed and halted, even reversed, by determined policy action. But, as the history of bubbles from Dutch tulips to subprime mortgages has shown, only for a while.

Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve and a member of the US central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee, said a September interest rate rise was \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been a few weeks ago. Dudley also sought to reassure investors that a recent global stock market rout did not reflect a problem with the US economy. The indication that a rate rise would be delayed helped to calm investors unnerved by the prospect of an imminent tightening in credit costs in the world\u2019s largest economy. The prospect of a rate increase had also alarmed global stock markets because it could draw investment funds out of emerging markets and back to the US.  In China, Jiang Chao, a strategist at Haitong Securities, predicted that China\u2019s central bank would cut interest rates further, which would make stocks attractive again, given the sharp drop in valuations during the recent crash. \u201cFrom today, I\u2019m no longer pessimistic,\u201d he said.

Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: \u201cVolatility like this doesn\u2019t tend to disappear fast and with volumes set to thin out ahead of the long weekend, there\u2019s certainly the prospect of seeing more big moves in the near term.\u201d", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Business", "FTSE", "Dow Jones", "China", "World news", "Global economy", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-27T17:26:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/28/stock-markets-surge-for-second-day-running-after-black-monday-losses", "sentences": ["The Shanghai stock market gained 5.3%, its biggest gain for eight weeks, to continue a global rally that has ended two weeks of relentless selling leading up to China\u2019s Black Monday this week.", "Concerns that China could be trapped in a period of low growth turned to outright fear and triggered a selling spree on the Shanghai exchange."], "title": "Stock markets surge for second day running after Black Monday losses", "article": "Global stockmarkets surged for a second day yesterday, recovering most of the losses they suffered in Monday\u2019s crash after the Chinese authorities bought shares to prop up prices and figures showed US growth surging ahead. The mood was helped by signals from the US central bank on Wednesday that it was unlikely to raise interest rates if the turmoil continued for much longer. The Shanghai stock market gained 5.3%, its biggest gain for eight weeks, to continue a global rally that has ended two weeks of relentless selling leading up to China\u2019s Black Monday this week. Yesterday Britain\u2019s blue chip companies gained \u00a360bn as the FTSE 100 index climbed 3.6% to 6192. The one-day rise was the sharpest in percentage terms since October 2011. European exchanges finished more than 3% higher and at 18.00 BST the Dow Jones in New York was up 2.2% at 16,641.   Related: US markets close higher for second day as global economy shakes off losses    Figures showed that the US economy had picked up the pace of growth in the three months to the end of June, to an annualised 3.7%. The sharp rise beat economists\u2019 estimates as businesses ramped up investment.  But it was a question-and-answer session with US central bank official Bill Dudley on Wednesday that gave the biggest boost to confidence when he hinted that interest rates would stay low for longer. The prospect of cheaper credit lasting possibly into next year cheered stock markets that had previously predicted a rate rise following the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next month. Analysts remained divided over what would be the next phase in the stockmarket saga that started two weeks ago after a surprise devaluation of the Chinese currency. London-based consultancy Capital Economics said economic fundamentals in Asia were stronger than the recent sharp fall in shares would suggest. But Albert Edwards, a renowned observer of the Chinese economy, said the two-day stockmarket rally had brought temporary respite in a bear market that would continue losing value. Edwards, an economist at investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, warned investors that they were deluded if they thought that the west could avoid being affected by problems in emerging markets, or that central bankers could successfully come to the rescue by cutting the cost of credit to boost consumer and business borrowing. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said that at the very least markets would remain volatile. \u201cBlack Monday was a truly dreadful day for stock investors, but it has been followed by a big bounce, with the FTSE 100 now back where it ended last week. It would be foolhardy to suggest we\u2019re out of the woods yet, though, and share prices are likely to remain volatile for some time.\u201d  Markets have endured some of the worst volatility since the financial crisis amid fears over China\u2019s slowing economy. In an attempt to shore up flagging growth and stabilise stockmarkets, Beijing slashed interest rates this week for the fifth time in nine months.  The Chinese economy has slowed since last year, when Beijing began to restrict bank lending, especially to the property sector. The authorities wanted to prevent a housing crash, but found the economy more broadly beginning to slow. The country\u2019s crucial manufacturers began to falter as the value of the yuan rose against the dollar, undermining the cheapness of their exports.  When figures showed exports had dived by more than 8% in July, Beijing intervened, allowing the currency to fall more than 4% against the dollar. Concerns that China could be trapped in a period of low growth turned to outright fear and triggered a selling spree on the Shanghai exchange. Emphasising the fallout across the region from the slowing Chinese economy, Thailand, Southeast Asia\u2019s second biggest economy, said it would speed up domestic investments on 17 projects worth $47bn.  Analysts will this weekend be keeping a watchful eye on a meeting of central bankers from the major trading nations in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where they will discuss the path of the world economy.

Labor\u2019s leadership faces significant pressure from its industrial base \u2013 with several unions running advertising campaigns and organising protests against the foreign-worker provisions \u2013 and from caucus members who are uneasy about the contents of the deal. Kelvin Thomson, a Victorian Labor MP who serves as the deputy chair of the joint standing committee on treaties, said the party should not support the deal in its current form. The government has dismissed union criticism as \u201cracist lies\u201d, but Coalition MPs have reported that the campaigning is having an impact on voters in their electorates.

London\u2019s leading share index lost 6.7% during August while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 shed 10% over the same period.  That reflected growing concerns about the outlook for the global economy, as the world\u2019s growth engine, China, appeared to lose steam. Investors in commodities, shares and emerging market currencies have taken fright over the past month as moves by the Chinese authorities hinted at the true extent of their worries about slowing growth.  Among Beijing\u2019s actions, the biggest shock came from a dramatic devaluation of the yuan in an apparent attempt to shore up flagging exports. However, the FTSE posted a better than expected weekly performance after it clawed back losses incurred in the wake of Black Monday, when China\u2019s top share index plummeted and took the world\u2019s leading indices with it. At the close of a dramatic week that saw some of the biggest stock market swings since the depths of the global financial crisis, the FTSE closed up 0.9% on the day at 6247.94. That was a touch above the 6188 level where it started the week, but it was not enough to head off the worst monthly performance in more than three years. The index had tumbled 4.7% at the start of the week after fresh signs of economic weakness helped send the main Shanghai Composite Index down by almost 9%, leading China\u2019s official news agency to dub the sell-off Black Monday. Despite staging a recovery in recent days, the index lost almost 8% over the week. For other bourses outside China, optimism about the US economy and fresh emergency measures from policymakers in Beijing to stabilise the market helped power a recovery. By the end of the week, European shares had recouped their losses and Wall Street was up by 1%. The turmoil carried a silver lining for investors, as it prompted markets to push back expectations of when interest rates in the US and the UK might finally start to rise after years at record lows. It has also prompted policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to indicate that a looming interest rate rise might not go ahead as soon as expected. Indications that a rate increase would be delayed in the US helped calm investors unnerved by the prospect of an imminent tightening in credit costs in the world\u2019s largest economy.  The prospect of rates going up had also alarmed global stock markets because it could draw investment funds out of emerging markets and back to the US. Stanley Fischer, the vice chair of the Fed, said on Friday that he was waiting to see how data and markets unfold over the coming weeks before deciding whether to raise interest rates in September. When asked by the broadcaster CNBC if the case for a September rate hike was less compelling after the recent market volatility, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s early to tell. We\u2019re still watching how it unfolds. So I wouldn\u2019t want to go ahead and decide right now what the case is: more compelling, less compelling, etc.\u201d That followed comments from his fellow policymaker William Dudley earlier this week that it was unlikely interest rates would rise in September. One trader in London said: \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve got a bit of a breather after a crazy week. It\u2019s largely been a case of fast money trading in thin markets.\u201d  He added that he had not seen much evidence of long-term shareholders baling out of stocks. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t real issues for the Chinese markets.\u201d Traders and strategists said fears of a slowdown in global economic growth have yet to leave the market, even if loose monetary policy is expected to support stock prices.     Brent oil price. Illustration: Thomson Reuters    Oil prices had their biggest one-day bounce since 2009 on Thursday, with North Sea Brent and US light crude up by more than 10%. US crude is on track for its first weekly gain in nine weeks, ending its longest decline since 1986. Global oil markets have fallen by a third since May and are still well under half their value a year ago, thanks to a huge oversupply of fuel and sluggish demand. Worries about China\u2019s economy have compounded the falls in recent weeks. But analysts said oil markets fell too far, too fast and a rebound was on the cards. A stock market rise, strong US growth data and a pipeline outage in Nigeria provided an excuse for a recovery on Thursday, they said.

Yes, there will be a short delay to the expected date for a first interest rate increase, but all the signals are still pointing towards a normalisation of global growth, wages, inflation and interest rates. There are other signals to consider, however. A shrug is not the appropriate reaction when Ford says it expects annual car sales in China to decline for the first time in 17 years. Likewise when Volkswagen recently revealed its first slide in deliveries to China in a decade.  China is the world\u2019s largest car market and a bellwether for the financial health and confidence of most consumers. Chinese car production in June was down 5.3% compared with the previous month, and sales slumped 6.1% over the same period.  Not since December 2008, in the depths of the credit crunch, have the production and sales of passenger cars in China declined simultaneously.

The city\u2019s festival is vast, exuberant and intoxicating \u2013 and a giddy opportunity for price gouging that almost every business in town takes advantage of. It is the perfect capitalist model: the owners of assets such as hotels and restaurants skim off large profits, while the people who make those profits possible \u2013 the performers sweating in the city\u2019s aircon-dodging venues \u2013 walk away penniless. Take the Ibis, a budget hotel, in the city centre. It makes no bones about its \u201cdynamic\u201d pricing model, with a digital screen facing the street showing the latest shocking room price updates. Last week it was like the Shanghai stockmarket, just with soaring prices rather than collapsing ones. I don\u2019t recall the exact figure, but on the Saturday it was asking above \u00a3230. This for a hotel that charges \u00a335 a night for advance bookings at other times of the year. Not far from the Ibis, I was lucky to get a seat for one of the triumphs of this year\u2019s festival, a theatre production called 1972: The Future of Sex. It\u2019s the third time Wardrobe Ensemble has played at Edinburgh, and even after great reviews and sold-out performances, it will barely cover its costs. One of the group\u2019s actors, Ben Vardy, told me: \u201cWe broke even in our first year, and made a small loss in our second. We will turn a small profit this year because it has been very, very successful. But when I say profit, I mean under \u00a3100 each.\u201d The business model for the creative industries is broken. For every performer at Edinburgh working for nothing, read musician on Spotify or writer on the net. Providers of content make peanuts, while the controllers of the infrastructure, such as Google, walk away with extraordinary profits. It was ever thus, some might argue, although the internet has allowed businesses to extract profits with a precision previously not possible. How can we transfer some of the wealth grabbed by, say, hotels in Edinburgh and hand it to the people who generated it? A city-wide tax on hotels and restaurants during the festival, the money redistributed to performers? Utopian, probably, and in any case illegal under our tax regime.

Growth was looking more established and the legacy of the financial crisis was dimming. The US central bank and the Bank of England looked poised to affirm the recovery by finally starting to raise interest rates after keeping them for years at emergency levels. Even the eurozone, having come close to unravelling once again, by this month appeared to have put the latest Greek crisis behind it. All that changed on China\u2019s \u201cBlack Monday\u201d last week, when the stock market sell-off that had been rumbling along for weeks turned into a rout. A near 9% fall in the main Shanghai Composite index, its biggest one-day drop since 2007, reverberated around global markets, sending other bourses from Sydney to Wall Street tumbling. In London, dramatic moves on the FTSE 100 were reminiscent of the worst days of the last crash. The worries went well beyond China\u2019s immature stock markets: there were growing signs that the country\u2019s real economy was slowing at an even sharper pace than officials in Beijing had feared, awakening fears that the global economy was headed for a fresh crisis. China\u2019s GDP growth last year of 7.4% was already the slowest for 24 years; it was also the first time this century it had fallen short of the official target. Now there are doubts China can hit this year\u2019s lower target of around 7%. Despite a string of interventions by policymakers, including a shock devaluation of the yuan this month, the world\u2019s growth engine appears to be spluttering. It is too soon to tell if China\u2019s wobble will spark a new global downturn. By the end of last week, stock markets in Europe had regained their Black Monday losses. But jitters have not gone away as investors, businesses and policymakers brace for more Chinese shockwaves. From the property market to petrol prices, what does the turmoil in China mean for the UK? Property market At the luxury end of the UK property market there are fears that wealthy Chinese investors burnt in the sell-off will have less to spend in Britain. But so far estate agents report that turmoil at home has only served to increase the attractiveness of property in the UK. \u201cThe Chinese are increasingly focused on diversifying their assets and uncertainty over the performance of the stock market reinforces this. There is anecdotal evidence that Chinese buyers have intensified their interest in \u2018safe haven\u2019 global property markets, including London, as a result of the recent stock-market volatility,\u201d says Tom Bill, head of London residential research at Knight Frank. Rob Weaver at residential crowdfunding platform Property Partner says: \u201cWith the recent financial turmoil in China, eyes from the east will focus even more sharply on the capital as a safe haven to park foreign investors\u2019 cash. Financial crises often put London back in the frame.\u201d For the wider housing market, the prospect of interest rates staying at their record low for longer should support demand and buoy prices, economists have said. In commercial property little impact was expected from events in China, says Jeff Matsu, senior economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. \u201cYou have to look through this and stay the course. If you get distracted by movements in markets that can be dangerous as an investor.\u201d Shares and pensions UK shares, like all European markets, have been buffeted by the dramatic swings on China\u2019s exchanges. Almost \u00a374bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 index on its worst day last week, as it tumbled 4.7% following the new Black Monday. But by the end of the week it had recovered the losses, buoyed by brighter economic news from the US and more emergency measures by China\u2019s policymakers to shore up their rattled markets. Still, over August as a whole the index suffered its worst monthly loss since May 2012, down 6.7%. Financial experts advise pension savers with money in shares not to worry about short-term volatility. The more important question is what the longer-term returns look like. There are two big factors at play in the FTSE\u2019s ups and downs. First, there is the level of risk investors attach to shares in general. As sharp falls in Chinese stocks shook investors\u2019 nerves around the world last week, they ditched those assets seen as riskier, including shares, in favour of so-called \u201chavens\u201d like gold and government bonds. But most analysts think equities are likely to remain an attractive investment as the global economy continues to recover, albeit slowly. Equities will also probably remain attractive as long as yields on assets such as bonds remain low and commodity prices hover around multi-year lows. The second factor weighing on the FTSE is the importance of mining and energy company shares in the index. They suffer when worries rise about Chinese demand for commodities such as iron ore, oil and copper. Shares in miners Glencore and Anglo American hit fresh all-time lows last week. If concerns intensify over China\u2019s economic slowdown and wider global growth, these sectors are likely to suffer further losses and keep the wider FTSE under pressure. Interest rates The debate has been heating up over when policymakers at the Bank of England will opt to lift interest rates in the UK from their record low of 0.5%, where they have been for more than six years. The latest turmoil on Chinese markets and worries about the global economic outlook provide further food for thought for the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. Last month, Bank governor Mark Carney indicated that the turn of the year could bring the first UK rate rise since the global financial crisis and, speaking in Jackson Hole on Saturday, Carney said: \u201cDevelopments in China are unlikely to change the process of rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert.\u201d But, with the growth outlook less certain and inflation kept low by cheaper commodities, the Bank and the Fed may well hold off, economists reckon. Next May looks the most likely time for a UK rate rise, says Andrew Goodwin, at the consultancy Oxford Economics. But there are plenty of risks that could push it back still further, most notably stemming from China. \u201cA hard landing for China could lead to much lower growth and inflation in the UK which, in turn, could potentially delay the first rate hike until 2017 or beyond,\u201d says Goodwin. In the US, traders have also scrambled to scale down their rate-rise bets after a key member of the US central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee appeared to play down the chances of a move next month. Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, said a September rise was now \u201cless compelling\u201d than it had been just a few weeks ago.

The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that the growing trade links mean uncertainty in China will be felt in some way in the UK. Furthermore, many British companies in supply chains could also be affected if China\u2019s trade with the eurozone is hit, says Adam Marshall, the group\u2019s executive director of policy. \u201cYet UK firms doing business with China should hold their nerve. China remains rich in opportunities for UK exporters, both in the short and longer term,\u201d Marshall adds. For now, China remains a relatively small part of Britain\u2019s export market, notes John Hawksworth, chief economist at the consultancy PwC. \u201cUnless things get a lot worse in China, the impact on the real economy in the UK should not be that great. \u201cChina accounts for less than 5% of UK exports, even including Hong Kong, so the direct trade effects of a slowdown there will be limited outside a few sectors such as luxury cars and consumer goods.\u201d But after the manufacturing sector contracted in the latest quarter, businesses themselves appear more worried. Almost half \u2013 47% \u2013 of companies polled by manufacturer\u2019s organisation EEF said they were concerned about a possible sharp slowdown in China. That comes on top of lingering fears about Greece leaving the eurozone, with only 22% of the 284 manufacturers surveyed saying they were not concerned about a re-escalation of the crisis in Greece. \u201cFor some sectors in manufacturing, the slowdown in China is not a new story. We\u2019ve seen exports of vehicles to China, for example, on the slide since the end of last year,\u201d says EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. But the worries go beyond exports and the manufacturing supply chain, she says. \u201cThe more widespread impact, at least in the near term, is likely to be the knock to already-delicate confidence levels.\u201d Consumer spending Oil prices have tumbled over the last year and that is boosting household budgets for many Britons. China is the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, so signs of an economic slowdown helped push down the oil price last week: at one point benchmark Brent crude was below $43 per barrel compared with a peak of $115 last summer. Some of that fall is feeding through to fuel prices and should help keep inflation low in the UK. Inflation has hovered around zero for most of this year while average wages are growing by more than 2%, leaving workers better off in real terms. That pattern looks set to continue with low oil prices and it should bolster consumer spending, the main driver of Britain\u2019s economic growth. \u201cA lower oil price will boost household budgets in the UK, Europe and the US, which should feed through into spending. The $70 fall in the oil price over the last year puts $6bn more into the pockets of oil consumers each day \u2013 a level of economic stimulus even central bankers would be proud to notch up,\u201d says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. The depreciation of the Chinese currency will also help dampen British inflation through cheaper imports. Taking services and goods together, China was the second-biggest source of imports to the UK last year, behind the US.     China\u2019s waning appetite for oil means fuel prices are likely to remain low.

The prospect of borrowing costs staying lower for longer has pushed the pound down against the US dollar. Last week sterling fell to its lowest level against the dollar for more than a month. The pound also weakened against the euro for the fourth week running. Those moves bring a little respite for UK exporters, who say they have been struggling because the strong pound makes their goods more expensive to overseas buyers. For UK holidaymakers, however, it means that those who booked their holidays late in the summer have found that their overseas spending money does not stretch quite so far as it did for those who headed abroad in July. KEY PARTNER Growing market Between 1993 and 2013 China\u2019s share of global GDP rose from 1.7% to 12.2%, in contrast to Europe and America, the UK\u2019s traditional trading partners, whose share of GDP fell over the same period. Exports to China have risen over the last decade and now account for 3.2% of UK exports \u2013 the sixth biggest destination for UK businesses. China is the largest foreign market for British cars. Imports grow Chinese imports to the UK rose even faster, to 7% of UK imports in 2014, making China the second largest import partner after America. But they outstrip exports Due to imports growing faster than exports, the UK\u2019s goods trade deficit with China has widened to stand at \u00a322.1bn in 2014, second only to the gap with Germany. Direct investment Foreign direct investment (FDI) between the UK and China has also grown. UK investments held by Chinese citizens rose from \u00a3119m in 2004 to \u00a3950m in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. China is also an increasingly important destination for UK investment. UK citizens held \u00a36bn of FDI assets in China in 2013 \u2013 more than treble the amount in 2004. UK in ChinaThere are far more UK businesses operating in China than Chinese businesses in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics. In 2012 there were 61 Chinese-owned businesses in the UK, compared with 654 UK-owned companies operating in China. That accounts for 2.8% of UK owned enterprises abroad. Biggest export Motor vehicles top the list of UK exports to China, the world\u2019s biggest car market and the largest single market for British-built cars after the UK. Last year, more than 137,000 UK-built cars were exported to China, an increase of almost 15% on 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Economic recovery", "Stock markets", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-30T15:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/30/mark-carney-interest-rates-misses-clouds-on-the-horizon", "sentences": ["His view, however, depends on how insulated the UK has really become in recent years, and whether the shockwaves from Shanghai, Tokyo and New York have faded into mere ripples by the time they reach UK shores."], "title": "Mark Carney's blue-sky take on interest rates misses clouds on the horizon", "article": "Forget the financial turmoil in China and around the world. When it comes to the UK, Mark Carney would have us believe he remains in charge. The Bank of England governor gave a robust defence on Saturday of his position as the UK\u2019s most influential policymaker. That means base interest rates are still going up, perhaps in February or thereabouts, and will be on course to touch 2% by 2018. It was a bold attempt to face down economists and City analysts who argue that Carney is largely impotent as the aftershocks of the 2008 crash continue to play themselves out. They see him as having little choice but to sit on his hands and watch, such is the force of the convulsions. Interest rates, the central bankers\u2019 main lever of influence, must stay at their historic lows for fear of worsening the pain. This not only the case for the Bank of England . The US Federal Reserve is also itching to push up interest rates, but has so far felt too anxious to make a move. The experience of Sweden\u2019s central bank plays on their fears. It boldly announced a rate rise in 2010, only to see the economy stall and prices start to fall. Today the Riksbank suffers the indignity of maintaining negative interest rates, which means Swedes are unable to bring themselves to spend a krona unless they know the bank will lend it to them at almost zero cost. Carney, however, says his anxiety levels have subsided. The threat of another Great Depression, or even Swedish slump, is in the past, he feels. In his contribution to a three-day gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he dispelled each argument in turn that global factors will keep prices low. The first is the \u201csecular stagnation\u201d argument promoted by the former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and others, that western economies face a long period of low growth as populations age. Savings are sent abroad in search of higher yields, at the expense of domestic investment in infrastructure, education and other activities that enhance productivity. The second is that the newly expanded global workforce will keep wages low for many years to come. If it is basic economics that rising wages have the biggest effect on prices, then an era of surplus labour will mean inflation staying lower for longer.  The third is based on concerns about a succession of destabilising financial events that cements the view of a post-crash global economy in need of low interest rates. |From higher food prices in 2012 following a series of poor harvests to China\u2019s current credit crunch and an oil glut that has more than halved the price of crude, these events tell us that the engine of growth is still sputtering. Taking those arguments in reverse order, Carney says that events such as food and oil price fluctuations have little influence on the core measure of inflation, which he sees rising strongly over the next couple of years.  He says the introduction of 1.5 billion people from India, China and the former Soviet republics into the global workforce over the last 25 years may have doubled its size to 3 billion, but that the phenomenon has reached its peak and so is not a defining issue.  He acknowledges that a savings glut is a factor in the changing shape of the economy as the population ages, but again he does not see it as decisive. As such, he says, a new normal has established itself more akin to the situation 30 years ago than last decade, in which economies such as Britain\u2019s are insulated from global forces to the extent that they can follow their own monetary policies. His survey of Britain in isolation reveals an economic landscape as pretty as a Pissarro painting. \u201cIn the UK, there is no evidence of the development of a deflationary mindset among businesses and households,\u201d he said. \u201cSpending is picking up rather than being delayed.  \u201cConsumer confidence is at its highest level in over decade and retail sales have been growing at well above past average rates. Firms\u2019 investment intentions are robust, and inflation expectations remain consistent with our 2% target.\u201d Carney is no fool. His arguments are to be taken seriously, but he ignores some important trends that upset his narrative. Britain\u2019s labour market looks healthy following several years of expansion and the recent trend for rising wages. The latter, however, is only six months old. After such a short time, it is not surprising that real average wages have only clawed their way back to 2004 levels. Years of increasing part-time and self-employed work since 2008, mostly on low wages, only recently switched to a healthier reliance on new full-time jobs. To make matters worse, the most recent GDP figures showed manufacturing caught in a trap of uncertain demand and a higher exchange rate that makes exports more expensive. The Bank, like many forecasters, points to rising investment and consumer spending, but much of the investment is in property and the consumer spending based on higher personal borrowing. Higher interest rates may address the UK\u2019s addiction to credit to some extent, but the medicine is not without side-effects. Carney only need glance at the hundreds of thousands of householders who have mortgaged themselves to the hilt \u2013 and who will have to cut their high street spending back when monthly interest payments rise \u2013 to see how his forecasts could go awry. The resulting downturn in spending would illustrate the fact that, despite its size and complexity, Britain\u2019s economy is a two-trick pony. Without property and consumer spending, Britain would be going nowhere fast. Looking more broadly, it is hard to see how the steady increase in skilled labour around the world benefits UK workers. On the one hand it creates a greater number of more affluent consumers, but the flipside is downward pressure on wages. The seismic events following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Deng Xiaoping\u2019s embrace of western capitalism are well in the past, but labour is still plentiful and employers remain top dog. Carney says the Bank has taken all this into account, and for that reason rates will probably not rise too far. His view, however, depends on how insulated the UK has really become in recent years, and whether the shockwaves from Shanghai, Tokyo and New York have faded into mere ripples by the time they reach UK shores.", "tags": ["Interest rates", "Economic policy", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "Politics", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2015-08-30T15:36:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/29/kids-co-calais-and-ketchup-the-big-summer-2015-quiz", "sentences": ["What was that gentleman\u2019s name?Jack WarnerSolly MalatsiTokyo Sexwale20How far did Greg Rutherford jump to win gold at the World Athletics Championships?8.21m8.32m8.41m21What happened in what Beijing called China\u2019s Black Monday this August?The Hong Kong Currency Susan fell by 12.1%The Shanghai Composite fell by 8.5%The Chengdu Dragon rose by 6.2%22Only one of the following is true of Greece."], "title": "The big summer quiz 2015: Kids Co, Calais and ketchup", "article": "      Kids Co, Calais and ketchup ... the big summer 2015 quizWhether you\u2019ve spent the holidays basking by the pool in Marbella or dragging the kids out of the house for some fresh air \u2013 you may have missed the key events of the past few weeks.

Webber finished the last stint to take the chequered flag in his No17 Porsche 919, the first WEC win for him and team-mates Timo Bernhard and Brendon Hartley, having completed 203 laps. It had been a dominant run that saw them finish a lap ahead of their sister car the No18 919 of Neel Jani, Marc Lieb and Romain Dumas in second and the No7 Audi of Andre Lotterer, Benoit Treluyer and Marcel Fassler in third. After the No18 crew took the win at the Le Mans 24 Hours, with Webber\u2019s squad in second, another one-two in the fourth round of the FIA WEC has made the championship battle even closer. Audi had won the two opening races at Silverstone and Spa but with four rounds to go, the Audi No7 team now lead Webber, Bernhard and Hartley by just 17 points and are only 19 ahead of the second Porsche.   Related: Porsche win Le Mans 24 Hours race for the 17th time    \u201cAchieving the second one-two after Le Mans is great for our team,\u201d said Webber. \u201cThis is my first Porsche victory and, of course, it is a big day for Brendon, Timo and myself, and it is always a team effort. The two of them were awesome, we had no technical issues and took an important step by improving our performance on shorter tracks. Traffic was sometimes brutal today, but we made it.\u201d Indeed at times for the top-end LMP1 prototypes threading the needle through the slower cars looked harder than ever on the tight challenge of the N\u00fcrburgring, which, hosting the WEC for the first time, was understandably popular with German fans \u2013 over 62,000 turning out for the weekend. Nor had it been entirely plain sailing for the winning car. Webber won here in F1 for Red Bull in 2009 after a brilliant performance in which he had to come back from a drive-through penalty. Never one to shirk from a challenge, this time he was given a setback from the moment he stepped into the car for his first stint, as a replacement nose had to be fitted. Making up the lost time would have been difficult, with the No18 out front and showing some pace but they set to it and were there to take over when the other Porsche was given three separate stop-and-gos, amounting to 1minute and 35 seconds, for using over the allocated fuel allowance due to a faulty sensor.  Webber, Bernhard and Hartley responded as might have been expected, putting the hammer down and punishing their main rivals Audi. \u201cWe stayed focused,\u201d said Hartley, and they had, taking a lap lead and maintaining it for the rest of the race.  All of which will be worrying for Audi, who won the manufacturers championship in 2012 and 2013. Porsche were running a new high-downforce configuration on their 919s at the N\u00fcrburgring and it worked to perfection. They had a clear pace advantage over their rivals, which will carry through to the remaining races of the season at Circuit of the Americas, Fuji, Shanghai and Bahrain. Porsche lead the manufacturers championship from Audi by 33 points, so the latter are still in the chase. However the fact that the second-placed Porsche had secured that spot by the last set of stops, despite having taken the three penalties, is an ominous display of form that Audi cannot ignore. They look like they need to find at least three-tenths of a second per lap in pace before the next round at Austin on 19 September.  The No8 Audi of Lucas di Grassi, Lo\u00efc Duval and Oliver Jarvis let their sister car past in the final hour, as it is in the fight for the drivers title, and finished in fourth. Last year\u2019s champions, Toyota, remained well off the pace and although they continue gamely, clearly next year\u2019s new car cannot come soon enough. They finished three laps back with the Anthony Davidson, Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima in fifth and the sister car of Alex Wurz, St\u00e9phane Sarrazin and Mike Conway a further lap back in sixth.

In Korea, the Kospi index was down 1% after worse than expected export figures and in Australia the ASX200 index closed down 2.12% as economic growth threatens to dip into negative territory for the latest quarter when figures are released on Wednesday. China\u2019s official manufacturing index based on a survey of factory purchasing managers fell last month to 49.7, the lowest level since August 2012, from 50.0 in July. The index, compiled by the Chinese Federation for Logistics and Purchasing, is based on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate expansion. A separate survey, the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index, fell to a six-year low of 47.3 from 47.8 in July. The number was slightly better than the preliminary reading released last month which prompted the Black Monday panic. Caixin\u2019s survey focuses on smaller, private enterprises while the federation\u2019s survey is weighted toward larger, state-owned companies in China\u2019s manufacturing industry, which employs tens of millions. Taken together, the surveys provide a bleak picture of stubborn weakness in the overall economy. China\u2019s economic growth held steady at 7% in the latest quarter ending in June, which was the weakest performance since the 2008 global crisis. Officials hope to maintain the growth rate for the rest of the year but many economists doubt the target will be met. In the latest attempt to shore up flagging economic growth, China\u2019s communist leaders cut interest rates last week, the fifth time they have done so in nine months. There has also been heavy intervention to shore up the stock market. \u201cThe policies coming out of China with regards to its equity markets are a cat\u2019s cradle of contradictions,\u201d said Angus Nicholson of IG in Melbourne.  \u201cReports that China will no longer support the stock market were followed up by clear intervention in the market last Thursday.  \u201cIt seems pretty clear that there are deep disagreements at the highest levels of the Chinese government over what to do with the equity markets. The Chinese government is no monolith, and many departments and organisations can pursue policies counter to each other.\u201d The central bank rate cut had been expected after a slew of disappointing recent economic indicators, including a larger-than-expected 8.3% decline in July exports, weak retail sales growth and slowing industrial production and investment. Last month\u2019s business sentiment was also weighed down by sharp declines in China\u2019s stock market and a surprise currency devaluation that roiled markets worldwide and a devastating explosion in the busy port of Tianjin. \u201cRecent volatilities in global financial markets could weigh down on the real economy, and a pessimistic outlook may become self-fulfilling,\u201d said He Fan, Caixin Insight Group\u2019s chief economist. \u201cMacroeconomic regulations and controls must continue and fresh reform measures must be introduced.

Related: Stock markets hit by weak Chinese factory data - business live    The Reserve Bank of Australia left its key interest rate at a record low on Tuesday on the eve of what is expected to be a limp set of economic growth figures. As the share market and Aussie dollar were hit by renewed uncertainty about the Chinese growth, the central bank said a cash rate of 2% was appropriate for an economy that is expected to be growing below its long term average of 3 to 3.25% \u201cfor some time yet\u201d. Economists expect Wednesday\u2019s national accounts will show the economy grew at about 0.5% in the June quarter, half the pace recorded in the previous three months. That would translate to annual growth of around 2.2%. But some experts believed that economic activity may even have shrunk in the three months to the end of June. Figures released on Tuesday showed that the country\u2019s trade deficit ballooned to $19bn for the second quarter compared with $13.5bn in the first three months of the year.  A fall in exports thanks to poor weather in April which closed coal ports cut a larger than expected 0.6 percentage points from growth although other data showed government spending in the same period was larger than forecast.       Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, said the firm had revised its Q2 forecast downwards to 0.1% and would be \u201cno surprise\u201d if Wednesday\u2019s number was negative. The ASX200 share index experienced a torrid day on Tuesday, falling 2.12% to close at 5096, after two surveys showed China\u2019s huge manufacturing sector was contracting. Other key markets across the region, including the Nikkei in Japan and the China\u2019s own Shanghai Composite, also finished in the red.       The Australian dollar also struggled and was buying US70.80c at 6.30pm. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Australian chief economist, Adam Boyton, said continued soft demand for resources and slower growth in China were among the factors that could force the Australian dollar below US60c to its lowest value against the greenback since at least early 2003.   Related: Financial markets are not free \u2013 they're one of the last bastions of socialism    But the assistant federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, played down speculation that the economy could be set to shrink.

A lower Australian dollar, low interest rates and energy costs were all factors contributing to good growth across the economy, he said.

Global markets have been hit by a shares rout in China amid fears the world\u2019s growth engine is running out of steam. Those worries were fanned overnight by news that the output of China\u2019s factory sector slumped to a three-year low in August. Shares in Europe were sharply lower on Tuesday morning, extending losses made over August, the worst month in years for European stock markets. The FTSE 100 was down a heavy 2.3% at 6,104 in mid-morning trading and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 2.5%.

China\u2019s Shanghai composite index suffered a smaller 1.3% loss. In the UK, a key survey of manufacturers was weaker than City analysts had been expecting and it highlighted businesses\u2019 growing concerns about China. The headline activity index on the Markit/Cips UK manufacturing PMI fell to to 51.5 in August, from 51.9 in July, confounding forecasts for it to edge up to 52.0. While the index was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, economists said it suggested manufacturers would make little contribution to overall economic growth in the UK in the coming months. Official data last week showed the manufacturing sector contracted in the second quarter while overall GDP growth was a solid 0.7%. Echoing official figures showing UK unemployment edging up in recent months, the jobs index in the PMI survey dropped below 50 for the first time since April 2013, as larger companies in particular cut jobs. Manufacturers continued to rely on the domestic market as new export business contracted for the fifth successive month. \u201cThe sector looks unlikely to make much of a contribution to the solid gain in broader GDP growth expected for the third quarter,\u201d said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit. \u201cExport order volumes continue to disappoint, with the sterling exchange rate, weak sales growth to the eurozone and the slowdown in China all having an impact. Given that China makes up only a small proportion of UK exports, the direct impact of a slowing in that nation is likely to be minimal. However, it is too early to say what the indirect impact may be if there is any knock on effect for broader global economic growth.\u201d  Economists point out China\u2019s slowdown has mixed effects on the UK. The downward pressure on oil prices is keeping inflation low and should boost household budgets. Meanwhile the market turmoil could prompt the Bank of England to keep interest rates at their record low for longer. But for exporters, waning demand is another blow on top of a stronger pound, that makes UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers. Manufacturers say that while direct UK exports to China are relatively small, there could still be a blow to factories who supply other European exporters.  Mark Stephenson, manufacturing expert at the consultancy Deloitte, said the China worries added to pressure on UK companies. \u201cA reduction in demand from China for imported goods would affect both direct UK imports and those of the broader global manufacturing base that UK manufacturers supply. The supply chains of many UK manufacturers depend upon Chinese manufacturers and will be impacted to varying degrees,\u201d he said. A survey by the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF published over the weekend showed almost half \u2013 47% \u2013 of companies were concerned about a possible sharp slowdown in China.  \u201cFor some sectors in manufacturing, the slowdown in China is not a new story. We\u2019ve seen exports of vehicles to China, for example, on the slide since the end of last year,\u201d said the EEF\u2019s chief economist, Lee Hopley. The worries go beyond exports and the manufacturing supply chain, she added. \u201cThe more widespread impact, at least in the near term, is likely to be the knock to already-delicate confidence levels.\u201d The slowdown in the UK PMI index published on Tuesday mirrors the picture in surveys from China and the eurozone. China\u2019s official manufacturing index, based on a survey of factory purchasing managers, fell last month to 49.7, the lowest level since August 2012, from 50.0 in July.

Investor confidence has been rattled by a combination of factors. Alongside signs China\u2019s economy is slowing, the country\u2019s stock market has tumbled from multi-year highs in June and interventions by policymakers have done little to stem the rout.  At the same time, markets are bracing for the prospect of the first US interest rate rise since before the global financial crisis. Despite the recent market turmoil, there is still some expectation that the US Federal Reserve could hike as soon as this month, especially after its vice-chair Stanley Fischer said over the weekend that it was too soon to decide on a September move. The likelihood of higher borrowing costs in the US is undermining already fragile confidence in emerging markets from Latin America to Asia.  Against the backdrop of market turmoil, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned that global growth will be weaker than previously expected. Christine Lagarde also said emerging economies should be alert to potential shockwaves from China\u2019s slowdown. \u201cOverall, we expect global growth to remain moderate and likely weaker than we anticipated last July. This reflects two forces: a weaker than expected recovery in advanced economies, and a further slowdown in emerging economies, especially in Latin America,\u201d Largarde said in a speech at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta.

After sharp moves for oil and the prices of metals such as copper in recent trading, Lagarde cautioned they could remain under pressure.

Market attention will now shift to figures on the US labour market on Friday for more clues on when the country\u2019s central bank will feel ready to raise interest rates. September\u2019s decision will be finely balanced after several indicators have pointed to a slowdown in global growth.  The latest batch of manufacturing surveys that kicked off the month were no exception.

Xinhua, the state news agency, said on Monday a total of 197 people had been caught up in an investigation into the spreading of rumours about the stock market. Wang Xiaolu, a journalist for the Caijing business magazine, read out a confession on television admitting to spreading false information while reporting on the stock market. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sought to make a big splash just for the sake of sensationalism,\u201d he said. Reuters said it had not been possible to verify whether the journalist made his confession freely. Chinese shares have fallen about 40% since mid-June, rocked by concerns about a slowdown in its once booming economy and a surprise currency devaluation last month. On Tuesday the Shanghai composite lost 1.3%. The authorities in China have repeatedly blamed market manipulators and foreign forces for the turmoil. In July, the ministry of public security said it would help the China securities regulatory commission investigate evidence of \u201cmalicious\u201d short selling of stocks and indexes. Short sellers bet that prices will fall by borrowing securities and selling them in the hope they will be able to buy them back more cheaply. The clampdown on supposed market manipulators has set nerves rattling among investors about how China responds when markets do not act as Beijing would like. Michael Hewson, market analyst at the CMC Markets, the spreadbetting company, said the hardline approach seemed to be for domestic consumption. Outside investors would continue to have fears about the fundamentals of the Chinese economy and markets, he said. \u201cWhile these measures may suit the narrative of the Chinese government in helping mask some of the problems in the Chinese economy they do nothing for investor confidence, and in particular in improving investment confidence within China itself.\u201d Li was previously a managing director at the Chinese arm of the hedge fund GLG Partners, according to a biography posted on the website of the Rockefeller Foundation, where she is a trustee.

Obviously it\u2019s a huge deal, but beyond the numbers on Bloomberg terminals it\u2019s hard to put into perspective. Yet one way to think about what has happened in China over the past couple of weeks is the drawing to\u00a0a\u00a0close\u00a0of an entire system for running the\u00a0world economy. Over the past two decades, globalisation has fired on two engines: the belief that Americans would always buy the world\u2019s goods, of which the Chinese would make the lion\u2019s share \u2013 and lend their income to the Americans to buy more. That policy regime was made explicit during the Asian crisis of the late 90s, when Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan slashed US borrowing rates, making it cheaper for Americans to buy imports. And it was talked about throughout the noughties by central bankers fretting about the \u201cGreat Wall of Cash\u201d flooding out of China and into western assets. The first big blow to that system came with the banking crisis of 2008, which made plain that the US could no longer afford to continue as the world\u2019s backstop consumer. The latest dent has been made over the past couple of weeks in China. Because the debacle in Asia\u2019s number one economy has blown a hole in a string of hitherto long-held beliefs. First, it exploded the assumption that China can keep racking up double-digit growth rates forever. Stock markets are only the aggregate of investors\u2019 estimates of the future profitability of the companies listed on them. The crash on the Shanghai Composite suggests that shareholders are no longer so confident of the prospects for Chinese businesses \u2013 and with reason: data shows that China\u2019s manufacturing, investment and demand for commodities are all on the slide. More importantly, the last few weeks have shattered faith in the Beijing politburo as technocrats with an incomparably sure touch. Whatever doubts economists might have had over the sustainability of China\u2019s dirty-tech, investment-heavy economic model, they would normally be quelled with the thought that Beijing\u2019s \u201csuper-elite\u201d had a textbook for every occasion. But that was before the shock devaluation of the yuan on 11 August, followed by a jittery press conference called by the People\u2019s Bank of China \u2013 after which it spent hundreds of billions buying yuan to keep it strong, effectively reversing the devaluation. Couple all this with the national government\u2019s cack-handed attempts to shore up the stock market and this week\u2019s bizarre and reprehensible \u201cconfession\u201d on state TV from a journalist for talking down the stock market \u2013 and a picture emerges of a state government unsure how to deal with financial jitters and lashing out at any convenient target. Some caveats must be made. Shanghai\u2019s stock market is far too small to map accurately on to the country\u2019s economy, much of which remains state-owned. Over the past four decades, China\u2019s leaders have overseen the most extraordinary economic expansion of modern times. Even if the superhuman phase of China\u2019s boom is drawing to a close, it will almost certainly continue to rack up growth rates that the UK and others would find enviable. If only Britain invested more in\u00a0its future, rather than consuming for today. Most of all, this is not some mythical clash between communist and capitalist values: the authoritarian Middle Kingdom will remain capitalism\u2019s iPhone factory. But what\u2019s coming to an end is a terribly skewed system in which western consumers made up for disappointing wages by borrowing money from Chinese producers, who in turn bought up western bonds, banks and land. This is no bad thing for the west or China. Eight years ago, a wise man described China\u2019s economy as \u201cunstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable\u201d.

Roger Federer, who beat the world No1 handily in Cincinnati at the start of last week, did not quite match him on day two against Leonardo Mayer but there was little to fault in his 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 win against the lanky Argentinian, who was both good enough and profligate enough to blow five match points against him in Shanghai last year. That was on the outer edges of the game; this was nearer the fulcrum, the sign-off major of the season, with the Swiss, recently elevated back to No2 in the world, a genuine contender for the championship and his 18th major title. There is a way to go, of course, but Federer\u2019s fine form has no discernible end point after his excellent run at Wimbledon, where he served like a god to humble Andy Murray in the semi-finals before wilting a little against Djokovic in the final. Since then he has rested sensibly before returning to the smoke of the battlefield looking fit, fresh and dangerous. He turned 34 three weeks ago and is moving around the court with coltish energy. Again Federer felt confident enough to unfurl his new pet shot, the charge, for which Mayer had no more effective response than did Murray, Djokovic or Kevin Anderson in Cincinnati in the warm-up tournament.   Related: Novak Djokovic beats Jo\u00e3o Souza to move into US Open second round    Selectively crowding the net on his opponent\u2019s second serve, Federer bamboozled Mayer, who is no mug with ball in hand. The charge has become more than an oddity \u2013 even if Rafael Nadal, for one, is amazed Federer is using it in a major championship after the headline-grabbing experiment in Mason, Ohio. Federer smiles when it is suggested the shot is no more than a circus trick, with no place in a serious competitive arena. \u201cI\u2019m happy I was able to use it today,\u201d he said courtside. \u201cI hope to be able to keep it up. When you miss, it looks ridiculous. But my coach says keep going for it. Maybe some times I\u2019ve got to drop it.\u201d The game was up for Mayer in an hour and 17 minutes \u2013 six minutes longer than Djokovic\u2019s opening match and equal with Mikhail Kukushkin\u2019s third-set retirement win over Lu Yen-hsun. \u201cI think I got off to a good start today,\u201d Federer said in measured understatement. \u201cHe was a bit shaky in the beginning. When I got a break in the second, his level dropped. My serve got better and better.\u201d As for the revamped Arthur Ashe stadium where he has performed many of his glorious deeds, Federer observed: \u201cThis used to be the windy place. But here there is no wind. It is more consistent. Other than that, the roof is nice. It keeps the atmosphere in, although this has always been one of the best places to play tennis.\u201d Although casual fans came to see a ritual exhibition, Federer had good reason to remember Mayer and his big groundstrokes. In the only match they had played, Mayer held five match points before the Swiss (who struck 57 unforced errors) beat him 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (9-7) in the first round of the Shanghai Masters last year. \u201cThere were different conditions in Shanghai,\u201d Federer pointed out. \u201cIt is much livelier here. He\u2019s a good player when he has more time, but maybe today I rushed him a bit much.\u201d But, apparently, he has not been following his opponent\u2019s career that closely since. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was unseeded,\u201d he said beforehand. \u201cIt was a total shock to see that I was going to play him, because he\u2019s been seeded for some time now at majors. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s a really tough draw. Plus, the Shanghai match, was one of the luckiest matches I\u2019ve ever won in my career, to be quite honest.\u201d How baseless his fears were, and how little Federer ever has to rely on the struggler\u2019s friend, luck. After 17 minutes, he had hit four aces and led 5-0. The previous evening, against the hobbling Russian Vitalia Diatchenko, Serena Williams had hit five aces and led 5-0 five minutes faster. The Swiss was in no mood for charity. From there to the end, it was a procession. Federer struck 12 aces and won 84% of his first serves \u2013 not that far behind the 92% of Djokovic, and the 93% of Williams.

For months, friends and colleagues had urged this outspoken defender of China\u2019s voiceless to flee the country, but she resisted. \u201cShe said if they wanted to go after her they could go after her,\u201d one recalled. Then, in the early hours of 9 July, the knock finally came. \u201cMy flat\u2019s electricity has been cut off all of a sudden,\u201d Wang, 44, wrote in a post on WeChat. \u201cI heard the sound of people trying to break in.\u201d When a worried friend reached her home just a few hours later, she was gone. Wang Yu\u2019s detention was the opening salvo in what activists call an unprecedented government crackdown on China\u2019s small but energetic community of human rights lawyers. Over the following days, dozens of attorneys known for defending underground Christians, political dissidents and social activists were detained or interrogated across the country. State media accused them of forming an \u201corganised criminal gang\u201d. Nearly two months on, more than 20 people remain missing or in custody. \u201cIt is a very scary scenario,\u201d said Yu Wensheng, a Beijing attorney who knew Wang and spent 24 hours in custody after speaking out over her detention. The escalating repression has appalled human rights activists, with some calling on Barack Obama to cancel Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s first state visit to the US later this month. Yet there has been only muted public criticism from foreign governments, who fear damaging their ties with the world\u2019s second largest economy. During a speech at Peking University last month, the British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, heralded the dawning of a new \u201cgolden era\u201d of UK-China relations and alluded only fleetingly to the developing crackdown. \u201cOur relationship [with China] has become sufficiently mature that we can be candid with each other in our private discussions about those areas on which we do not see eye to eye, including human rights,\u201d Hammond said. Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University expert in Chinese history and politics, said Beijing would view any foreign criticism as irrelevant. \u201cTo hell with that,\u201d he said. He said Xi Jinping saw China\u2019s activist lawyers as part of a broader threat to the Communist party\u2019s very survival and was determined to bring them to heel \u2013 whatever the world thought. Xi believed lawyers, liberal academics, journalists and church leaders were using what he saw as incendiary western ideas about civil society, constitutionalism, press freedom and the rule of law to undermine \u201cthe absolute rule of the party\u201d, MacFarquhar said. \u201cI don\u2019t see China drifting into democracy but [Xi] is right to be alarmed that there might be some traumatic event even bigger than the Sichuan earthquake or the Shanghai meltdown which lights up the country. He doesn\u2019t know what that would be \u2013 no one does. So he wants to guard against it by putting the lawyers in jail, by putting the dissidents in jail, by attacking foreign influences like Christianity. \u201cThe sine qua non of all Xi Jinping\u2019s actions \u2013 of any Communist leader of China\u2019s actions \u2013 is that the party must prevail,\u201d added MacFarquhar, who has described Xi as the country\u2019s most powerful ruler since Mao. He added that anyone who questioned its supremacy was \u201cfair game\u201d.  Wang Yu, a commercial lawyer who began taking on human rights cases in about 2011, is one such person. In and out of the courtroom, Wang built a reputation as a fearless champion of the downtrodden and a perpetual thorn in the government\u2019s side. She defended feminist activists, members of the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong and Ilham Tothi, the respected Uighur academic who was last year jailed for life for inciting separatism.  In 2013, Wang travelled to the southern island of Hainan to help the families of six schoolgirls who had allegedly been sexually assaulted by their headmaster. Hoping to highlight the injustices suffered by her clients, she staged a small street protest in which she shouted: \u201cTake up legal arms! Fight for your rights!\u201d Wang, who has a teenage son, knew the risks of her activism only too well. \u201cThese days people say being a lawyer is a high-risk job,\u201d she said. \u201cEach time I go out on a case other lawyers get worried about me. They say, \u2018Don\u2019t go on your own. If you go alone I will worry.\u2019\u201d But she vowed to fight on. \u201cThe only way to be safe would be to stop what I am doing.\u201d The impact Xi\u2019s offensive will have on China\u2019s weiquan, or rights defence, movement, which began forming just over a decade ago, remains unclear.     Yu Wensheng, a Chinese human rights lawyer who has spoken out against Wang Yu\u2019s detention. Photograph: Tom Phillips/Guardian    Some lawyers now refuse to discuss the recent detentions, apparently fearing reprisals. Others claim the repression will only inspire further resistance.  \u201cChina is still an authoritarian and conservative state and somebody has to make the sacrifice,\u201d said Yu Wensheng, one of the movement\u2019s newest adherents, during an interview at his spartan office overlooking Beijing\u2019s urban sprawl. \u201cAs far as I am concerned, we would rather face the regime\u2019s oppression than have to bear the humiliation of bowing to it. I\u2019m much happier facing oppression than standing by watching the wrongdoing and not trying to change it. Many human rights lawyers share my view on this, I think.\u201d Almost two months after Wang Yu was seized, her whereabouts remains a mystery. \u201c[Police] told us she was under residential surveillance at a designated place but refused to tell us the exact address,\u201d said her lawyer, Li Yuhan. Activists fear Wang is facing charges of \u201cinciting subversion of state power\u201d. Yu Wensheng said security agents were likely to have isolated his colleague in a small hotel room in an attempt to extract a false confession. \u201cIt\u2019s even worse than being in a detention centre where you can at least have human contact with other inmates,\u201d said Yu, who is 48. \u201cThey interrogate you three times a day and they deprive you of good sleep. The lights in the rooms have to stay turned on even while you are sleeping and at least two people stand outside in case you run away.\u201d Two years earlier, in the summer of 2013, Wang Yu sat in another hotel room, in the southern city of Shenzhen, and spoke of what had driven her to take on the system. \u201cMany people think: \u2018China is rich, China is developing quickly, China has tall buildings, wide highways, fancy cars,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know that Chinese people are like animals that don\u2019t have any basic rights.\u201d \u2022 Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-02T08:08:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/02/student-media-awards-winners", "sentences": ["Paul Traynor, Associated Press video correspondent in Shanghai Broadcast journalist of the year 2013 I took a couple of years out after uni and ended up working in TV production for four years before doing a masters in TV journalism.", "I am now AP\u2019s Shanghai video correspondent."], "title": "Student Media Awards: where are the winners now?", "article": "Not everyone who wins at the Guardian Student Media Awards goes on to become a successful journalist, but the lists of past winners are peppered with many who did.  Ahead of the 11 September deadline for entries, the Guardian spoke with some recent winners who have made it into journalism to find out what impact winning had on their career.  Patrick Kingsley, migration reporter, the Guardian Student journalist of the year 2009 I was editor of the student newspaper and we swept the awards that year and all the people who won had won for work written while I was editor. Basically I was riding on their coat-tails. Winning the award was the thing that got me to where I am today. At the time, even though wanting to go into journalism, I just wasn\u2019t convinced I would be able to make it. I didn\u2019t really want to spend a lot of money on a masters, and my parents weren\u2019t going to support me to faff around freelancing, so I was going to do a Teach First course.  But then I won the award and that got me six weeks\u2019 work experience at the Guardian. So instead of revising for my finals, I was doing work experience on the news desk. In the first few minutes I was asked \u201ccan you write 500 words on this by lunchtime?\u201d Eventually I was doing election coverage and on the night of the 2010 election debates I was a very minor cog in the team doing the late editions of the paper. I was given more responsibility than I expected and for some reason people in the building thought I wasn\u2019t too bad at it. As a result I thought maybe I should stay around freelancing, I put the teaching job on hold and instead got a contract with G2. My current job is being migration correspondent for the Guardian. It basically involves travelling around to the different hotspots of what you might call the European migration crisis to create a very broad picture of what\u2019s going on. Jonathan Liew, sports columnist, the Telegraph  Student columnist of the year 2007I won for the sports column on the back of the student paper, Injury Time. One of the columns I entered was about why darts shouldn\u2019t be an Olympic sport, one was about Joey Barton mooning fans, and one was about the protester who ran on to the Ibrox pitch. It featured lots of quite puerile puns.  People say student journalism is not really great practice for proper journalism, because you get over-indulged. But nowadays I write an irreverent back-page column, so in this case it has been a seamless transition. At that stage of what isn\u2019t even your career yet, there are very few ways of gauging how well you are doing \u2013 whether you are or could conceivably be any good. The award spurs people on who maybe weren\u2019t sure whether they have what it takes. [When I applied for the Telegraph] they had vaguely heard of me because of the awards so it gave me a little boost. Joseph Stashko, digital news development editor, the Times and Sunday Times Digital journalist of the year 2011 I entered a local news website called Blog Preston \u2013 it\u2019s still running with someone else at the helm. It was sometimes unglamorous local news reporting, but really helped ground me. I also entered my Twitter feed, which focused on social media news verification.  It prepared me for the basic instincts and behaviour around calling people up, getting quotes talking to the right people at press offices. What it didn\u2019t prepare me for was going from university environment, which at the time you think is the biggest thing ever, to sitting in a national newsroom where it\u2019s unfathomably on a bigger scale. I think just doing the entry forces you to be selective and look at your work, if you treat it like a job application and look at what the judges will respond to. You are very insular when you are working away at uni, but when you look at other entries it also alerts you to other people going in to the industry. My job now is working on the news development desk of the Times and Sunday Times. It\u2019s about creating new ways of doing journalism, whether that\u2019s day to day interactive pieces or long term strategy. It\u2019s been a progression for someone who\u2019s always been interesting in editorial, but also product management.  Paul Traynor, Associated Press video correspondent in Shanghai Broadcast journalist of the year 2013 I took a couple of years out after uni and ended up working in TV production for four years before doing a masters in TV journalism. During the course we had made a 30-minute current affairs documentary and I said \u201cwe should probably apply for this [award] because our film\u2019s quite good\u201d.  I didn\u2019t take any of the internships [that came with the award] because I got a job, but I know it definitely helped my colleagues. I had the award by the time I went to interview for my current job and it\u2019s definitely something that stands out. The criteria for the journalism awards is quite stringent, especially for broadcast \u2013 it gives you an extra nudge through the door. I am now AP\u2019s Shanghai video correspondent. That involves coordinating coverage and covering China outside Beijing. Beijing get tasked with the day-to-day desk news, capital news and politics. I get to do a lot more features, entertainment, a lot more sport and I get to travel a lot to places such as Myanmar to cover stories. I think I\u2019ve worked for a very long time to get to where I wanted to be now. Obviously there are some aspects you want to improve, you want to get paid more, there are some aspects you want to be different. But where I am at the moment, for any young journalist, if you want to be in breaking news and you want to be in TV, I am in a great place. I get to do tons of stuff that\u2019s really cool.  Heidi Blake, investigations editor, BuzzFeed Diversity writer, features writer and journalist of the year 2007 I won for a series of articles about marginal groups in York. They included a long read about the experiences of transgender students on campus and a piece about a young lesbian woman fleeing persecution and rape in Sierra Leone who was being denied asylum in the UK because she had a child so the authorities refused to believe she was gay.  Winning the awards gave me a great leg-up when I was applying for graduate training schemes straight out of university, without having the semi-obligatory expensive journalism masters degree on my CV. I got a place on the Daily Telegraph\u2019s graduate scheme which was a fantastic fast track into Fleet Street. Everything you can do to mark your CV out from all the hundreds of others helps enormously.  If you ask me, investigative journalism is the best job in the world. I love being able to pursue the stories I feel passionate about wherever they take me, and being part of a team working together to crack the case. It\u2019s every bit as thrilling as I dreamt it would be all those years ago eating pizza at 3am in the student newspaper office.

In a downbeat report that charted the increasing risk of a global slowdown, the IMF said finance ministers attending the conference in the Turkish capital needed to maintain government spending despite the still high public-sector debts left over from the 2008 banking crash. It said emerging economies reliant on the sale of oil and basic commodities would be especially vulnerable to a decline in trade with Beijing, which has soaked up much of the world\u2019s resources in the last decade. \u201cRisks are tilted to the downside, and a simultaneous realisation of some of these risks would imply a much weaker outlook,\u201d it said, reinforcing a warning from the IMF boss, Christine Lagarde, earlier this week.

In New York the Dow Jones was 100 points higher, while the FTSE-100 index of leading UK firms echoed continental exchanges to climb 0.4% to 6,083. The German Dax added 32 points, while the French CAC put on 14 points as both rose 0.3%. The Dow improved after industry figures showed US businesses added jobs at a steady pace last month, with most of the gains in the construction sector, which has boomed in response to a resurgence of housebuying.    Related: IMF chief warns of slower growth after China shockwaves    Manufacturing also showed solid gains, with few signs of factory closures or layoffs in response to falling exports to China. The payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday that businesses added 190,000 jobs last month, up from 177,000 in July, but below a six-month high in June of 231,000. Analysts said the figures suggested that turmoil in the financial markets and worries about faltering growth in China have not yet had much impact on the US job market.  A solid performance for the UK construction sector had also boosted investor confidence. The CIPS/Markit survey of the industry showed the housebuilding sector expanding quickly alongside an improving demand for commercial building work. Earlier, the Shanghai market had tumbled to a 4% loss until the China Financial Futures Exchange said it would take further steps to curb excessive speculation in stock index futures trading. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday to consider a further loosening of its monetary policy to combat threats from China to the eurozone\u2019s steady recovery. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, is expected to say that the bank considered, but rejected, expanding its quantitative easing programme, which is currently pumping \u20ac85bn (\u00a362bn) into the banking system each month to support extra lending. Analysts said it was possible the ECB could step in later this year if declines in global trade continued to damage the prospects for the eurozone economy. Speaking ahead of his arrival at the G20 conference, Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner for economic affairs, said any threat to global growth posed by China\u2019s slowdown would be tackled by the eurozone international economic authorities. He said: \u201cI\u2019m reasonably optimistic and confident as far as the EU and eurozone is concerned. I think these economies are robust enough to resist some uncertainty which could come from other markets, knowing the authorities \u2013 monetary and political authorities in China and also the outside world \u2013 are ready to address those questions.\u201d Fears that higher interest rates in the US will send the dollar soaring, raising the costs to emerging economies of financing their massive dollar debts, have dogged financial markets all year.

The report cites an energy future that\u2019s heavily dependent on oil and gas during the difficult transition to more sustainable energy sources. ExxonMobil then drafts a socially imperative role for itself:  We believe all economic energy sources will be necessary to meet growing demand, and the transition of the energy system to lower carbon sources will take many decades due to its enormous scale, capital intensity and complexity. As such, we believe that none of our proven hydrocarbon reserves are, or will become, stranded.  This single paragraph, of central importance to ExxonMobil and its shareholders, relies on one key prediction: oil and gas demand will continue to grow. This prediction, in turn, relies on two assumptions:  Energy demand will continue to grow at a predicted rate Low carbon energies will take a \u201cmany decades\u201d to develop  These assumptions have been accepted wisdom for many years, and with good reason. Energy demand, despite gains in efficiency, has continued to climb due to the growing global population and economic development, which historically correlates quite closely with increased energy demand. Low carbon energy technologies have also taken years to develop; the uptake of these technologies has spanned decades. But change is sneaky, and models based on historic truths have a tendency to collapse. The implications for ExxonMobil are problematic, to say the least. Take the demand side of the model. The report cites the growth of the global middle class \u2013 the consumer class \u2013 as a major driver of energy demand over the next 30 years. China represents the largest of these emerging middle classes.  But recent data indicates the growth of the Chinese consumer class over the past five years has been slower than predicted. In March, the Chinese government lowered growth projections to 7%, a value it called the \u201cnew normal\u201d. A couple of years ago, the Economist even predicted that China would be lucky to hit its growth predictions, prophesying the same deceleration in Brazil, Russia and India \u2013 the next three largest prospects for an emerging middle class.  Growth is slowing, and there are very few indications that the growth curve will rebound. The effect? A Shanghai stock market plunge on 12 June, government suspension of trading for weeks, a 2% devaluation of the yuan against the dollar, and, most recently, another plunge in the Shanghai stock market on 24 August, which wiped out all gains of 2015.  My guess: the error bars on that energy demand prediction suddenly got a whole lot bigger. The assumption that lower carbon technologies will take decades to come up to speed also seems antiquated. New battery technologies, lower cost solar panels, a vast array of new finance mechanisms, the rampant growth of green bonds \u2013 these are all indicators that the organic growth of low carbon energy is much faster that we predicted just one year ago.    Related: Exxon knew of climate change in 1981, email says \u2013 but it funded deniers for 27 more years    Even more worrying for the traditional predictions that hold oil and gas in such prominence is the fundamental transformation in how we access energy. The energy supply chain we grew up with \u2013 power company to storage to distribution network to homes, parallel, but separate from, gasoline-powered cars and trucks \u2013 is disappearing.  The future instead promises a distributed network by which your home and your car will generate and store energy just as soon as they draw it off. Driverless cars will have transformational impacts on energy efficiency, energy distribution and energy demand. Technology platforms that streamline transactions between buyer and seller \u2013 think Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Google, iTunes \u2013 are reconfiguring how we conduct commerce and the energy required to buy, sell and move goods.  These are just a few examples of the enormous changes in today\u2019s energy economy. So, back to ExxonMobil\u2019s Citizenship Report. One must wonder: surely they see these same shifts undermining the assumptions of the energy models? It is, after all, a very smart company. And yet no mention of uncertainty finds its way into this central corporate claim. What\u2019s going on? The problem, again, appears to be one of dependence on historical truths. The dilemma for ExxonMobil is not the role of oil and gas in this rapidly changing energy future, but rather the expectations of shareholders that have invested in ExxonMobil based on past performance. Shareholders look to ExxonMobil and other large, integrated oil and gas companies to be low risk and high return. Veering from course \u2013 that is, straying from the historic returns associated with oil and gas development \u2013 will carry a high penalty in terms of shareholder backlash. Just look at what happened to Dow stocks after one of the YesMen \u2013 a comedy group \u2013 posed as a Dow spokesman and announced that the company would assume full responsibility for the aftermath of the Bhopal tragedy.  In theory, ExxonMobil has the capital and know-how to maneuver rapidly into new energy spaces. In reality, the expectations of shareholders for the good old days of high margin, low-risk oil and gas development effectively shackles ExxonMobil to its current course.  It is no wonder then that ExxonMobil is holding fast to the traditional energy scenarios that maintain oil and gas as the predominant energy force for the next 30 years. To abandon these energy scenarios, or even introduce the potentially radical transformations that are on our doorstep, would be economic suicide perpetrated by shareholder revolt.  That\u2019s problematic because ignoring growing uncertainty in energy models of the last 30 years seems to be an equally effective form of economic suicide. Simply put, ExxonMobil, accountable to its shareholders, is stuck firmly between a rock and a hard place.", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "ExxonMobil", "China", "Russia", "Brazil", "Bhopal", "Business", "Environment", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Pollution", "Sustainable development", "Energy efficiency", "Energy", "Ethical and green living", "Energy industry", "Commodities"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-03T14:49:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/03/mario-draghi-ready-to-prop-up-eurozone-with-more-stimulus", "sentences": ["The data, which included an 8% fall in exports in July, has triggered a series of responses from Beijing that included cutting the value of the yuan and buying the shares of smaller companies on the Shanghai exchange."], "title": "Mario Draghi ready to prop up eurozone with more stimulus", "article": "The euro fell sharply and stock markets rose after the European Central Bank boss said he was ready to provide more stimulus to prevent the eurozone\u2019s faltering economy being hit by worries over China. The ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said the eurozone\u2019s growth prospects had suffered in recent months and could worsen if the slowdown in China and turmoil in emerging markets took a turn for the worse. He said he expected to have a better sense of the outlook for the Chinese economy after the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank policymakers in Turkey at the weekend, but in the meantime he held open the possibility of pumping further funds into the Europe\u2019s banking system to boost growth. \u201cWe are observing a weakening of the prospects of the Chinese economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has two effects substantially. One is through the trade channel, weakening the economies of the rest of the world \u2026 and the confidence effect on the stock market and all the other financial markets, which is also operating on the negative side.\u201d  Draghi\u2019s comments echoed a report earlier this week from the International Monetary Fund that said weakening growth in emerging markets, largely in response to a cut in China\u2019s forecasts, would damage the recovery of the global economy. The IMF said central banks should maintain flows of cheap credit to households and businesses and consider opening the taps further if the global situation deteriorates.  Stock markets have gained and lost trillions of dollars in recent weeks as traders wrestle with a stream of dire economic figures from China.  The data, which included an 8% fall in exports in July, has triggered a series of responses from Beijing that included cutting the value of the yuan and buying the shares of smaller companies on the Shanghai exchange. Despite the IMF\u2019s caution, the US Federal Reserve meets on 17 September to consider raising its main interest rate. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said last weekend that the UK was on track for higher borrowing costs early next year. Draghi said the G20 summit was an opportunity to find out whether the current downturn was a blip or a more protracted situation. \u201cWe do expect to have much more visibility than we have today in the coming days of the G20 in Ankara. That is going to be one of the major themes of the meetings.\u201d The ECB, which kept interest rates on hold, has already started a \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3802bn) government bond-buying programme this year. The quantitative easing (QE) scheme, which involves injecting \u20ac60bn into the banking system each month, is due to end in September 2016, but assets purchases can run for longer if necessary, Draghi said.  The stimulus is intended to help get consumer price inflation back toward the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%. In the year to August, it stood at 0.2%. Draghi said it could go negative in the coming months following recent oil price falls.  The euro dropped 1% against the dollar and the yen as traders bet on the ECB flooding the eurozone with extra funds in an effort to counteract some of the fallout from Asia. Stock markets jumped at the prospect of cheap credit and a lower-value euro boosting business profits. The German Dax and French CAC rose by more than 2.5% and the FTSE climbed 110 points to 6194, up 1.8%. Howard Archer, the chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said Draghi was preparing the ground for further stimulus with his remarks. \u201cThe door is now clearly wide open to the ECB stepping up its near-term pace of QE and/or increasing its overall size and duration,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhether the ECB steps through that door will clearly depend on whether eurozone growth continues to struggle and inflation prospects deteriorate further.\u201d Andrew Bosomworth, a spokesman for the bond fund manager Pimco, said the ECB was beginning to mimic the Bank of Japan as it struggled to deal with a stagnating economy buffeted by volatile financial markets. \u201cThe ECB has limited confidence in reaching its inflation objective over the next two years, the policy-relevant time horizon, suggesting more stimulus might be needed. \u201cWhile the ECB\u2019s QE programme was always open-ended from the start, downside risks to the 2017 inflation forecast raise the likelihood the ECB increases the quantity of bonds it purchases each month from \u20ac60bn or continues QE beyond September next year.\u201d", "tags": ["Eurozone", "Euro", "European Central Bank", "Global economy", "Business", "Currencies", "Economics", "Europe", "European Union", "European monetary union", "World news", "Mario Draghi"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-03T18:36:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/04/zhang-kai-chinese-human-rights-lawyer-could-face-spying-charges", "sentences": ["In 2003, Zheng Enchong, a Shanghai-based rights lawyer, was jailed for three years for allegedly providing state secrets to entities outside of China."], "title": "Chinese human rights lawyer could face spying charges", "article": "A Chinese human rights lawyer who disappeared into police custody last month after joining the fight against a government drive to take down church crosses could face spying charges. Zhang Kai, a Beijing-based attorney, was seized by security officials on 25 August in Wenzhou, a city in the eastern province of Zhejiang sometimes referred to as China\u2019s Jerusalem because of its large Christian population. Zhang had been in Wenzhou offering legal support to churches battling a controversial Communist party demolition drive that has targeted Christian places of worship since late 2013.   Related: China's Christians angry as removal of church crosses continues    Writing on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, two weeks before his detention, Zhang said: \u201cI have thought it through: at worst they can put me in jail. But if I keep silent, I will regret it for the rest of my life.\u201d Christian activists claim the removal of more than 1,200 crosses \u2013 and the complete demolition of some churches \u2013 in Zhejiang is a deliberate attempt to slow the growth of their faith. There are now estimated to be as many as 100 million Christians in China, a reality the 85 million-member Communist party appears to find increasingly concerning. A notice from Wenzhou public security officials that was published on social media said Zhang \u2013 whose whereabouts are not known \u2013 was being held on suspicion of two crimes. The first is \u201cgathering and disturbing social order\u201d, while the second, and potentially more serious, charge is \u201cstealing, spying, buying and illegally providing state secrets and intelligence to entities outside of China\u201d. Joshua Rosenzweig, an expert in human rights and criminal justice in China, said the maximum penalty for the latter charge was death, \u201cbut only under the most serious conditions which I have to presume do not apply here\u201d. Rosenzweig said charges related to \u201cendangering state security\u201d enabled the police to hold a suspect in a place of their choosing for up to six months without having to notify anyone of that location. It also allowed police to deny their suspect access to legal counsel. \u201cThis raises the possibility of tactical use of state security charges that can be later dropped,\u201d Rosenzweig said. In 2003, Zheng Enchong, a Shanghai-based rights lawyer, was jailed for three years for allegedly providing state secrets to entities outside of China. He was accused of sending a copy of a Chinese report about forced demolitions to a human rights group in New York. Yang Xingquan, who works at the same Beijing practice as Zhang, said it was not clear why authorities had levelled the same charge at his colleague but insisted he was innocent. \u201cI have faith in Zhang Kai. I don\u2019t think he would gather people and disturb social order. Nor do I think he would steal state secrets.\u201d Zhang, who like many of China\u2019s human rights lawyers is Christian, had been an outspoken critic of the cross removals. In March he posted an online essay denouncing the Communist party\u2019s treatment of Chinese churchgoers. \u201cI believe it is God\u2019s calling and a compelling and historic mission for today\u2019s Christian lawyers to seek justice and promote reconciliation and the rule of law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeople always ask me, what is the political environment going to be like this year? Will there be more oppression against churches? I want to answer with words from the Bible. \u2018Suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.\u2019 We should thank God for having been born in China in this era.\u201d Zhang had reportedly been due to meet with David Saperstein, the United States\u2019 ambassador-at-large for religious freedom, around the time he was detained.   Related: The case of Wang Yu, emblem of China's human rights crackdown    Saperstein visited China in late August and travelled to Zhejiang province where he called for \u201can end to the ongoing campaign of cross removals and church demolitions \u2026 and an end to harassment of members of unregistered religious groups\u201d. Yang Xingquan said Zhang Kai\u2019s faith would help him cope with his detention. \u201cHe is a Christian and he can bear the stress and stay strong,\u201d he said. Speaking on Tuesday, US State Department spokesman Mark Toner called for Zhang\u2019s release and said the lawyer\u2019s detention was \u201cindicative of an ongoing pattern that we\u2019ve seen\u201d in China. More than 20 people remain in custody following an unprecedented crackdown on human rights lawyers that began in July. They include Wang Yu, a 44-year-old Beijing lawyer who has not been seen since she was taken from her home in the early hours of 9 July. \u201cNobody is safe under a dictatorship,\u201d Wang told a visitor to her home earlier this year.

Jonathan Jones, Guardian art critic There are two terrible differences between architecture and other art forms \u2013 permanence and prominence. No one is making us read books we don\u2019t like and even the lousiest art exhibition soon ends, but the ludicrous warped ostentation of the Walkie Talkie is not going anywhere, no matter how many prizes for bad architecture it wins, nor can anyone in or near the City of London avoid its manic parody of modernity. It\u2019s time to reject this fatalistic sense that grandiose design mistakes are irreversible \u2013 that we just have to put up with them. I seriously think this building should be done away with. The reason is not just that it is silly in itself, bulging on the skyline like a model that has somehow wandered out of the 1960s TV show Thunderbirds, but even more urgently to shock developers into some sense of humility. For the Walkie Talkie, let\u2019s face it, is just the most risible of the plague of big, bad buildings eating up the capital\u2019s sky.    Demolish this deranged building to create a firebreak that ends the inferno of towers    London is being wrecked by outrageous crimes against architectural taste. Walking around the City, it really seems there is a competition to put up the most cynically flashy, vacuously ahistorical and insensitive eyesores. A corporate dystopia is being built before our eyes. This rush towards a chilly fake avant garde future seems unstoppable. What can anyone do, apart from moan or award the Carbuncle Cup? This is what we can do: demolish this deranged building to create a firebreak that ends the inferno of towers. Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum Nobody \u2013 not even, so I have reliably been told, its designer, Rafael Vi\u00f1oly \u2013 is happy with the way that 20 Fenchurch Street has turned out. Nobody except maybe for Peter Rees, for two decades the City of London corporation official who presided over the firestorm of high rises that has swept over the City of London with apparent glee. Standing outside the Design Museum, you used to get the most spectacular view of Tower Bridge and the river. Now the sky you used to see framed by the bridge is blocked by Vi\u00f1oly\u2019s work, the wrong building in the wrong place. But much as I would wish this unappetising lump gone, dynamiting it, or, more likely dismantling it piece by piece over a couple of years, is not a great idea. We demolish far too many buildings, too quickly. It is enormously wasteful, and it creates the idea that there are quick fix answers to tough problems. When Glasgow\u2019s once utopian high rises filled up with refugees and hard cases, the instant solution was to move them out, blow the buildings up, and start again, as if it were architects alone who were responsible for all that had gone wrong. Lousy wages, alcohol and war in the Middle East has got a lot more to do with it than Le Corbusier\u2019s doctrines. There are places in Britain that have gone through the cycle of demolish and rebuild three times in the course of a lifetime. You suggest that architecture leaves the public without a choice; they simply can\u2019t ignore it. I am sure that you of all people aren\u2019t suggesting that all new buildings should be as inoffensive as possible for fear of upsetting people? You should also not forget the fact that while you, I, and everybody that we know hasn\u2019t a good word to say for Vi\u00f1oly, or the work of a whole host of other, more obscure architects who at this very moment are building a cluster of equally tall, and equally grim tower blocks between Vauxhall and Battersea, minds do change. I still find it very hard to accept that Centre Point, a building that once personified hit-and-run property development, should now be a listed building. Conversely, I am dismayed when I hear that there are still people in charge of the Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall who still haven\u2019t woken up to the fact that these are buildings that are worth cherishing rather than destroying. JJ I definitely don\u2019t blame Le Corbusier for London\u2019s plague of architectural pretension. Or even Sant\u2019Elia, although buildings like 20 Fenchurch Street do seem to exploit modern engineering to create futurist dreams that would be a lot better left on paper. But I think 21st-century Britain has a neurotic compulsion to overprotect the new. The reason for this is that asinine conservatism was so fashionable for so long that we\u2019re terrified of returning to it. The Carbuncle Cup, let\u2019s not forget, takes its name from one of Prince Charles\u2019s less-than-progressive interventions in architecture. But now, everyone is so scared of sounding like Prince Charles or seeming to be a lover of mock-Georgian that we tremble to take the wrecking ball to this massive, tasteless monstrosity. Personally I am prepared to take the risk that a change in taste will make the Walkie Scorchie a lost masterpiece. Let it be mourned. The drawings might look lovely in a coffee table book. This is not about experiment versus caution, danger versus cosiness. We live in a golden age of architectural creativity but London is missing the point and instead of Gehryesque poetic miracles we get... Lego City. After a day in Paris at Frank Gehry\u2019s exhilarating fish-like, wave-like Louis Vuitton Foundation I found myself on the South Bank almost weeping at the view of 20 Fenchurch Street. What will London look like in 20 years at this rate? We can\u2019t let a fear of turning into Prince Charles make us the timid dupes of stuff that is not brave, just bad. Truth is, I\u2019d knock down a lot more than just this one scapegoat\u2026 DS You suggest that the Prince of Wales is guilty of \u201casinine conservatism\u201d for wanting to stop the building of the very same towers that you want to knock down? That sounds like having your cake while trying to eat it, never a good look.    What we need now is less dynamite, less sound and fury, and a hard look at how we can do things better.    Thirty years after the Prince suggested that \u201csay what you like about the Luftwaffe, they did less damage to London than Britain\u2019s modern architects\u201d, it\u2019s probably time to give him a break and move on. That view of 20 Fenchurch Street that brought you to tears is the exact opposite of what he wanted. We have ended up with the closest thing in Europe to the Shanghai skyline, not because of any individual architect, and not because of the prince, but because when Ken Livingstone became mayor he decided London\u2019s future was to be the financial capital of the world. He wanted it to look the part. That was when he called people who didn\u2019t agree with him the \u201cheritage Taliban\u201d. What we need now is less dynamite, less sound and fury, and a hard look at how we can do things better. JJ You\u2019re quite right of course \u2013 I was being unfair on Prince Charles. History has proved him right. But on the other hand I love modern architecture. The reason Livingstone was able to get away with caricaturing opponents as heritage Taliban is that this debate always gets so polarised in Britain \u2013 so it seems as if anyone who dislikes any modern building is calling for a return to the Victorian age. What\u2019s needed, surely, is a much more sensitive and socially purposeful public debate about architecture. When I said earlier that architecture has more power over our lives than other art forms, that is not just its danger but its glory. No other art can do so much to make the world we live in a better place. The London of today would be totally recognisable to the great 19th-century critic John Ruskin. He loathed the neo-Renaissance style of banks and business buildings in his day \u2013 he\u2019d see immediately that the ugliness of buildings like the Walkie Scorchie is a raw expression of money and greed. Instead, he would say, we need architecture that sets out to truly enrich the world about it with generous and imaginative public spaces and vistas, rich detail, and above all a sense of human community. I think Ruskin would advise pulling down this rubbish and starting again. In one of my favourite passages of his criticism he wishes a rich philanthropist would buy up all the paintings of minor Dutch masters, put them in a palace \u2013 and burn it to the ground. Well, you\u2019d be right to call that extreme. But architecture is different from painting because it takes up real space on earth, potentially forever. Either 20 Fenchurch Street is there as long as it endures, or we do something about it. In this case the stakes are too high to be conservationist. For the sake of London\u2019s future we need to put an end to this madness. Let\u2019s be Ruskinian and blow up the Walkie Scorchie. And Charles can press the button. Perhaps it would make a good way of celebrating his coronation. DS You\u2019re wrong about architecture being something that controls people\u2019s lives. People have the power to change the meaning of the buildings they inhabit. Even Stalin\u2019s gift to the people of Poland, the Palace of Culture in Warsaw, has turned into something the Poles want to keep. Let\u2019s not demolish Vi\u00f1oly\u2019s tower, let\u2019s turn it into a refugee hostel.

Those were the days before the duopoly of Nadal and Roger Federer, before the arrival of Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, a time so distant it seems as it if were in the last century. But Cilic brought sobriety back to the equation here last year when he beat Kei Nishikori in three lacklustre sets to became the first champion from outside the top 10 since Pete Sampras, ranked 17 in the world, won it in his farewell to the game in 2002. It was Cilic\u2019s 300th Tour win, returning him to the top 10 for the first time in four years, and the possibility loomed that he might recover the youthful lustre that attended his game during the 2010 Australian Open, when it took Murray four sets to stop him in the fourth round. The veteran tennis writer and commentator Bud Collins was hugely impressed by his Australian form and wrote handsomely about the young Croat as a star of the future. As it happened, Collins was being honoured in the Flushing Meadows media centre which has been named after him at the very moment Cilic was warming up to play the Frenchman J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy in the fourth round on a warm Sunday morning in a barely quarter-full Arthur Ashe stadium. With all due respect fine words butter no parsnips, as they say, and Cilic did not properly deliver on his promise. He did his job here, however, overcoming a rolled ankle in the second set that might have scuppered his campaign. He moved a match closer to the ultimate goal when he struck 23 aces [including four in the third-set tie-break] on his way to winning 6-3, 2-6, 7-6, 6-1 in two hours and 26 minutes. He told Brad Gilbert courtside: \u201cThe first couple of games after that [ankle injury] were not easy, I was conscious of it. But after that I didn\u2019t have any trouble at all. I played really good in the fourth set. I didn\u2019t lose too much energy here today. I\u2019m going to try to keep my streak going for a couple more matches.\u201d His appearance on the showpiece court was his second of the tournament but the first-up morning slot is not exactly the glamour match of the schedule, and it felt, rightly or wrongly, that the champion was being accommodated rather than feted. They keep the evening TV spots for the ratings pullers. He next plays Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who put out fellow Frenchman Benoit Paire 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 in an hour and 42 minutes. Collins, incidentally, has kept faith with Cilic, and was hugely happy for the quick-to-smile Croatian when he lifted the title last year. The champion\u2019s journey since that day has been less than gilded. He lost to Murray in his next tournament, in Beijing, then to Ivo Karlovic in Shanghai, before a handful of decent wins kept him in the mix for the ATP World Tour Finals in London where, unfortunately, he lost in quick succession to Djokovic, Tomas Berdych and Stan Wawrinka. He has not won a tournament this year and had a modest 18-13 log coming to New York, but the scene of his greatest triumph has plainly lifted him. He recovered well from his five-set fight against the Kazak Mikhail Kukushkin over four hours and 11 minutes on Friday \u2013 the longest match of the tournament so far \u2013 and took heart from another fine performance to beat Chardy, who had hit a rich vein of form.

Investors in China returning to their trading desks after a long weekend reacted to falls in stocks in the US and Europe on Friday. The sell-off pushed the Shanghai and Shenzhen CSI 300 index down by 3.4%, leaving the wider Shanghai composite index down by 2.5%.

He predicted markets would be more stable after weeks of turbulence.  His message was reinforced by China\u2019s top economic planning agency, which declared that the economy\u2019s growth prospects were improving. The NDRC said: \u201cThe power usage, rail freight, as well as real estate prices and turnover have all improved into August, indicating the economy is stabilising amid fluctuations.\u201d Beijing also received a show of international support over the weekend. G20 finance ministers and central bankers said they backed last month\u2019s yuan devaluation, as part of the difficult journey to a more market-determined exchange rate. China suddenly depreciated the value of the yuan against the dollar last month after a surprise fall in exports in July. Investors around the world panicked at the move which triggered weeks of turmoil on global markets. To prevent the yuan falling too far Beijing more than doubled the funds it used to support the currency during August to $93.9bn.  At $3.56tn, the currency reserves held by the People\u2019s Bank of China are still substantial and account for nearly a third of all holdings by central banks worldwide. But the recent spending has helped push down the value of its reserves from a peak of nearly $4tn in June 2014. Chris Weston, an analyst at the spread betting firm IG, said stock market traders were likely to take heart over the coming days from the support offered by the central bank.  \u201cWhether or not we have realistically seen the lows in the various Chinese markets is yet to be seen, but the belief and assurance provided by the Chinese authorities over the weekend suggests we may see better days ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, one day doesn\u2019t make a bull market.

Too often Seurat is summed up in a word \u2013 \u201cpointillism\u201d or the use of little dots \u2013 or even just seen as a slightly pixelated impressionist. In fact, his fractured, pulsing, eerily still fields of light and colour teeter on the edge of abstraction and anticipate 20th-century science as well as art. Perhaps what he and Riley have in common is that scientific sensibility; that interest in how the eye works and how we mix the colours of reality in our minds.

This exhibition sets out to show that \u201cCelt\u201d is a cultural construct, not an ethnicity. The word has been used with different meanings, and is as much a modern myth as a historical reality.

There are not many who dig down into the substance of life as tenaciously as Frank Auerbach. The sheer lust for life that ruts and ripens Auerbach\u2019s paintings is as powerful as London itself, the city whose streets and parks provide his only subject, along with intense portraits of friends. His style cannot be emulated because it is not a style. The massive textures and trench-like clay colours of Auerbach\u2019s grasping, searching works are not mannered effects, but the visible process of a painter wrestling with what he sees and feels.

Viola is daring and unusual among contemporary artists in the forthright way he engages with religion. The spiritual art of the past echoes in his work \u2013 martyrs, triptychs, meditation, all that sacred jazz. But it is not (necessarily) an art of belief. Rather, this Californian artist is fascinated by the loneliness and insight of the saint and the mystic, by the varieties of religious experience.

One year sunflower seeds, another year slides or sunsets. Now with a new sponsor, Hyundai, the annual series recommences with Mexican artist Abraham Cruzvillegas\u2019s Empty Lot. Working with the near-to-hand, and an acknowledgement of the necessary, improvisational way in which rural Mexicans build houses \u2013 and lives \u2013 for themselves in the city, Cruzvillegas\u2019s art is both sculptural and conceptual, founded in both materiality and necessity. This attitude of autoconstrucci\u00f3n (self-construction) is also at the heart of Cruzvillegas\u2019s art. Go on, surprise me.

Coptic Christianity has its own unique style, with touching, almost naive portraits and manuscripts, ancient monasteries and churches. This minority tradition has coexisted with the majority religion, Islam, whose own architectural and artistic splendour shapes the best-preserved quarters of Egyptian cities. Yet there is also a rich Jewish history in the country, and this, too, is explored. Not only does it show that Egypt has carried on being a great cultural centre long after the age of thepyramids: it also reminds us of the complexity and pluralism of life, art and history in the Middle East.

Like a tinkering artistic version of Edison or the Wright brothers, this great American sculptor asked basic, brave questions and found inventive answers to them. Calder\u2019s most famous invention is the mobile \u2013 a loose constellation of coloured shapes suspended by wire or thread and gently moving in free space. Calder\u2019s mobiles resemble three-dimensional animations of his friend Joan Mir\u00f3\u2019s surrealist paintings, but they also, surely, mirror the subatomic worlds that were being discovered by quantum physics in the 1920s and 1930s.

A game of sculptural manners, materials and scale, and working between abstraction and figuration, David\u2019s development is filled with surprises, rather than just more of the same.

Customs data showed that exports for August were down 6.1% but imports fell a whopping 14.3%, raising more questions about the strength of the country\u2019s economy.

According to Tuesday\u2019s draft plan, the circuit-breaker mechanism would help prevent \u201cexcessive reactions of investors\u201d.

The A-share market has seen violent plunges recently, and with the circuit breaker mechanism investors would have a cooling period before taking irrational actions.\u201d The stock exchanges were soliciting public opinions on the plan and the public have until 21 September to comment.  In another bid to stabilise the markets, it was announced that Chinese investors who hold their stock for over a year will be exempt from a 5% dividend tax.  The ministry of finance said in a joint statement with the taxation authority and the securities regulator on Monday that if investors sold a stock after holding it for a month or less, they would be liable for a 20% payment of income tax on the dividend they receive. Investors who held a stock for between one month and a year would pay a 10% to encourage long-term investment instead of the short selling of stocks.

Related: Manchester City owners announce \u00a3265m deal with Chinese investors    There were no Chinese Super League matches in Beijing in early September because the Workers\u2019 Stadium was storing tanks for a huge military parade. It seemed an apt metaphor for a domestic league that has spluttered, stuttered and occasionally attracted headlines for all the wrong reasons during two decades in which Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, Paul Gascoigne and Sven-Goran Eriksson have passed through. In the shadow of that same stadium, however, bars were packed late into the evening with young fans watching Premier League action. Following a shaky start, when the Premier League ceded ground to the NBA and other European leagues by opting to show matches exclusively on pay TV, English clubs have become the means by which young middle-class Chinese choose to express themselves. Two Premier League matches per weekend are shown free to air on China Central Television, which reaches more than 320m homes across the country. Meanwhile, it has also invested in growing its presence on Chinese social networks and websites. Football as a spectator sport is huge business. Yet later that week, as if to demonstrate the scale of the challenge facing the sport, the Chinese national team drew 0-0 with Hong Kong to leave them third in their qualifying group for the 2018 World Cup.     Hong Kong players celebrate after they held China to a 0-0 draw in 2018 World Cup qualifying. Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    The result was seen by fans as the latest humiliation for the national side and an embarrassment for the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, who this year published a 50-point plan to turn China into a \u201csoccer powerhouse\u201d, proposing to overhaul the sport at every level. \u201cRevitalising soccer is a must to build China into a sports powerhouse as part of the Chinese dream. It is also what the people desire,\u201d said the central reform leading group, led by Xi, who has targeted improving the \u201csport economy\u201d as a key priority, even against the backdrop of recent market turmoil. With hosting and qualifying for the World Cup finals listed as long-term goals, the authorities plan to substantially increase the number of young people playing football, with the number of special \u201csoccer schools\u201d raised to 20,000 after five years and to 50,000 in a decade. According to Gorden Song, who runs a private equity Chinese sports investment fund, the goal is to achieve that aim partly by encouraging investors to sink money into football academies and local clubs across the country. \u201cThe Chinese government has decided to turn the FA into more of a social organisation,\u201d he says over coffee in a hotel within a stone\u2019s throw of the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, built for the 2008 Olympics but little used since. \u201cIt\u2019s a big change, there will be elections for the leader and it could be a businessman rather than a state official. \u201cTo develop faster it will focus on participation to try to grow the pyramid and grow football at different levels. In China there are no community clubs traditionally \u2013 there have been very few in the past, normally built by retired professional football players. In the last two or three years, we have seen more start.\u201d Traditionally there has been no football pyramid in China, because clubs were effectively banned for political reasons, with restrictions on gatherings of 10 people or more.

Photograph: Marcio Machado/ZUMA Press/Corbis    \u201cHow could you think about organising a football team when you couldn\u2019t even talk to your friends?\u201d wondered Rowan Simons in his book Bamboo Goalposts, which documented his spluttering efforts to kick-start community football in the country. Under the new scheme, the country\u2019s football association has been separated from the State General Administration of Sports for the first time, in an attempt to give it more autonomy and the ability to determine its own staffing and resources. \u201cYou have to develop interest and provide places to play,\u201d says Song. \u201cSome of the growth will come from companies investing in youth development and participation. Football is different to other sports, where you can identify talent at an early age \u2013 we call it soldier training. In football, you need a pyramid and a wide base.\u201d This is one of the reasons why China has been able to succeed in individual Olympic sports such as table tennis and gymnastics but has struggled when it comes to football. There is hope changes in society will also help, with parents being encouraged to consider the health of their children as well as academic achievement and the carrot of learning English from European coaches while exercising. One fascinating spin-off from this ambitious scheme to build a football infrastructure virtually from scratch across this vast land is the potential effect in Europe. Chinese investors were among those interested in buying Aston Villa last season. Although that approach foundered, Chinese investors have this year acquired the French second division club Sochaux and the Eredivisie side Den Haag. Professor Simon Chadwick, the chair in sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University, believes that other similar investments are inevitable and that the rationale is as much to learn from them commercially and technically as for business reasons. Ajax are believed to be among the clubs on the radar of Chinese investors. \u201cThe Chinese government has recently taken the decision to build the world\u2019s biggest sport economy, which it wants to have reached $850bn in size by 2025,\u201d says Chadwick. \u201cAt the heart of the country\u2019s sporting investment is football, which the state is very keen to promote. \u201cSpecifically, China would like to host and win football\u2019s World Cup, which the country sees as being a way to assert its global status and power. As a result, both the government and corporations in China are investing in football \u2013 from the grassroots through to the elite professional level, which includes buying stakes in European football clubs.\u201d In China, the national side have long been a joke and the domestic Super League hit a nadir in 2009 when a match-rigging scandal known as \u201cchip shot gate\u201d illustrated the extent to which it had become riddled with corruption. The brittle, almost nonexistent nature of amateur and youth football in China meant that the top tier became an unhealthy combination of big money, superannuated big names and clubs used as the playthings for local businessmen. Anelka, who had a short stint at Shanghai Shenhua, was just one who complained of \u201cgames behind my back\u201d. For some, the CSL represented the disastrous amalgam of the worst aspects of China\u2019s bureaucratic system and the controlled capitalism that encouraged chaotic private investment. The country has only once qualified for the World Cup, playing in the 2002 finals, and is determined to put that right before bidding for the right to host the tournament, possibly in 2030. As Simons pointed out in his book, China is one country for which Fifa has long been prepared to overlook its \u201cgovernment interference\u201d rules and this year football\u2019s governing body renewed its \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d with the state.     Brazil\u2019s Roberto Carlos scores the first goal in a 4-0 win over China at the 2002 World Cup. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images    \u201cBefore ordinary people ever actually played the game and long before European football became a lucrative TV sport, the dream of elite football success had already been hijacked by those with ulterior motives, including foreign powers, nationalist and Communist governments and, more recently, commercial enterprises,\u201d lamented Simons. \u201cFifa has handed the very game itself to the Chinese government and, under its control, football has become an entertainment show based on a sport the people have forgotten they are meant to play.\u201d The 50-point plan, with its emphasis on encouraging the billionaires who have sprung up in China over the past decade to sink funds into chains of private academies and facilities rather than overseas stars \u2013 and its recognition that top-down state control may not be the best way to run the sport \u2013 represents the latest attempt to set football on a new course. Whether it can reduce the gap between rhetoric and reality and make Chinese youngsters as enthusiastic about playing as they are about consuming the sport is another question entirely. China remains a magnet for the world\u2019s biggest clubs when it comes to extending their brand and increasing commercial revenues, while players too are increasingly aware of the potential upside \u2013 John Terry spent the early part of his summer touring the country.     Chinese fans of Bayern Munich cheer for the team before a pre-season friendly against Internazionale in Shanghai in July. Photograph: Xi Ya/dpa/Corbis    But as the game\u2019s biggest clubs continue to engage in an arm\u2019s race to reach China\u2019s burgeoning middle classes, the trend of the country\u2019s investors to scour Europe for clubs in which they can invest and from which they can learn is equally fascinating. For Chadwick, the lesson from other business sectors is that China will get it right eventually. If and when it does, it could tilt the sport on its axis. \u201cGiven China\u2019s recent record in other industrial sectors, one suspects that ongoing Chinese interest in football could well have a profound effect on the world\u2019s favourite sport,\u201d he concludes.", "tags": ["China", "Football", "Sport", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-08T11:34:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/08/strong-eurozone-figures-rally-global-markets-after-china-gloom", "sentences": ["Beijing has also imposed a raft of measures to prevent excessive speculation by individual traders, acting on their own behalf, who dominate the Shanghai market.", "Shanghai\u2019s composite index recovered from a poor start and finished up almost 3%."], "title": "Strong eurozone figures rally global markets after China gloom", "article": "Global markets yesterday shrugged off a big fall in China\u2019s monthly imports after figures showed the eurozone economy strengthened this year.

The price of oil moved higher in tandem with metals prices, though remained well below prices achieved before a stream of negative figures from China sent world markets into a spin. Figures from Goldman Sachs showed that some of the stability achieved in the subsequent months came from the 1.5tn yuan (\u00a3172bn) buying spree by Beijing, much of it on smaller company shares. The Chinese authorities spent about 600bn yuan in August alone.  Beijing has also imposed a raft of measures to prevent excessive speculation by individual traders, acting on their own behalf, who dominate the Shanghai market. In a signal that regulators believe more needs to be done, they said a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism, which would kick in to stop wild swings on its turbulent stock markets, was close to being implemented.

China\u2019s foreign trade dropped 9.7% in August, with customs data showing that exports for August were down 6.1% but imports fell 14.3%. The figures, which follow a similar slump in July, raised more questions about the pace at which the world\u2019s second-biggest economy was slowing and added to concerns about its contribution to global growth. In the first eight months of this year, imports were down 14.6% and exports fell 1.6%. However, Chinese stocks rose as some analysts calculated the data could lead to further policy easing in the coming months. Shanghai\u2019s composite index recovered from a poor start and finished up almost 3%.  Eurozone GDP growth, which has suffered a series of setbacks since the financial crash, grew in the second quarter after it was adjusted upwards to 0.4% from 0.3%. The first quarter was revised from 0.4% to 0.52%.Analysis of the figures showed that improvement was due to a surge in exports, which was driven by the falling value of the euro against the dollar and contributed a 0.3-point increase to quarterly growth.  Germany\u2019s trade was 2.4% higher at \u20ac103bn (\u00a375bn) adding another \u20ac25bn to the country\u2019s trade surplus, a record high. The ING economist, Carsten Brzeski, said the weak euro helped boost exports, especially to the US, which became Germany\u2019s single most important trading partner in the first half. There was also a silver lining to the disappointing Chinese import data for August, as some analysts saw it as a sign that China\u2019s authorities would do more to support the economy.  \u201c(There is some) hope that you\u2019ve got a lot more stimulus on the way from China,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG.

The trip has obtained permission from the North Korean government, thanks mostly to connections Uri Tours has developed with the country\u2019s tourism board. \u201cWe will not be the first to go surging surf in North Korea \u2013 a group already surfed last year with some locals,\u201d says Zanella. \u201cBut no one has yet done it with the intention of opening the country to surfing tourism \u2013 or to do surfing reconnaissance.\u201d By \u201csurfing reconnaissance,\u201d he means that in order to determine which areas might be best suited to beginner and intermediate surfers, the surf camp will study the country\u2019s coastline in depth, analysing the beaches and the seabed, pinpointing potential evacuation points and estimating which kinds of weather produce ideal surf conditions, and where. The study is integral for developing the country\u2019s surf tourism; that it\u2019s being done by foreigners is highly unusual for hermetic North Korea.     The week-long North Korea camp will be led by Nicola Zanella. Photograph: Emiliano Mazzoni    From research Zanella has done with Google Maps, he thinks the areas of Sijung and Hamh\u016dng, each a bumpy, six-hour drive north-east from Pyongyang, might be perfect for surfing. \u201cIt looks like there are wild forests that lead to pink- or yellow-sand bays,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is promising for surfing, as the cliffs protect the bay from wind coming off the ocean, but at the same time leaves the bay completely exposed to coastal storms.\u201d The camp is being held in September because Zanella hopes to benefit from wind and waves from the north-east and east, possibly from a monsoon that could blow from Japan. Aside from surfing lessons, a bonfire and dinner on the beach, the $2,750 trip will offer participants a ride on Pyongyang\u2019s metro, a visit to the demilitarised zone and \u2013 as required on any tour of the country \u2013 bowing before the statues of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. Flights to and from Shanghai, where the group will meet, are not included; the flight to Pyongyang is with Air Koryo (recently named worst airline in the world, for the fourth year running), and accommodation is in three- and four-star hotels in Pyongyang, Sijung and Hamh\u016dng. Local guides will escort the surfers for the entire trip. As to the ethical issues of travelling in North Korea, Lee of Uri Tours says: \u201cWe wrestle with ethical issues every day in our business, but ultimately we believe in what we do. Tourism does benefit the local economy in North Korea: it creates jobs and opportunities for a wide spectrum of people.\u201d There have already have been discussions about the possibility of another camp in 2016. For now, though, the programme\u2019s future is not yet scheduled. \u201cI would be lying if I said that surfing will become a rapidly growing market in North Korea,\u201d Zanella says. \u201cI imagine the first step will be a surf school with professional surf instructors teaching locals. If they need help with that, I would be there to help them.\u201d As for the big question of why go surfing in North Korea at all, Zanella doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cSurfing is not just an American or a Hawaiian sport. It is a human right. I think that North Korea deserves it as much as other countries.\u201d", "tags": ["North Korea holidays", "Travel", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Surfing holidays"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-09T05:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/09/japan-stock-market-rise-financial-crisis", "sentences": ["The Shanghai Composite closed 2.3% higher."], "title": "Japanese stock market sees biggest one-day rise since financial crisis", "article": "Japan\u2019s stock market soared on Wednesday after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, promised to cut corporate taxes and maintain the ultra-low borrowing costs that have supported the country\u2019s economic recovery over the last two years.

In Bon Jovi\u2019s case, the band reportedly played in front of a Dalai Lama backdrop in 2010. Whatever the reasons may be, fans in Shanghai and Beijing will have to swallow their disappointment. Billie Hologram? Lady Day\u2019s likeness is headed to New York Remember how creepy the Tupac hologram was when it appeared onstage at Coachella festival in 2012? Prepare to be freaked out even further when a Billie Holiday hologram debuts at New York\u2019s Apollo theatre this autumn. A likeness of the jazz and blues icon is set to feature as part of the theatre\u2019s continuous daytime programming, possibly speaking on tours of the venue. Why the world needs this is beyond me, but remembering the incredible legacy Holiday left behind as a performer and singer is a good thing.

Ringo Starr debuted a photo collection in London Star(r)s, they\u2019re just like us: they too take photographs, then tuck them away and forget about them for years. In this case, the former Beatles drummer unveiled a collection of old photos at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery \u2013 and used the exhibition launch as an opportunity to implore Yoko Ono, Olivia Harrison and Paul McCartney to \u201cdig out the negatives\u201d from years past.

Anyone who owns gospel album Amazing Grace will already be familiar with Franklin\u2019s seminal vocal performance. But the sessions featured on the album were also filmed by late director Sydney Pollack and are now at the centre of a legal wrangle. On the one hand, the film\u2019s producers want to showcase the footage that languished for decades, when Pollack failed to sync the video and sound recordings first captured in 1972. On the other, Franklin maintains she wants no part in her likeness being used for profit \u2013 agreeing to the album was one thing, but Franklin doesn\u2019t want the film to be released. It\u2019s been banned so far from both Telluride and Toronto film festivals, but I get the feeling the battle\u2019s not yet over.  Ice Cube brushed aside criticism of the NWA film You may remember a recent controversy attached to NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton. Journalist Dee Barnes, who knew the rap group and interviewed them in the 90s, alleged that Dr Dre had not only physically assaulted her, but that his violence \u2013 and the group\u2019s misogyny \u2013 had been airbrushed out of the film. In response, on Tuesday Cube told those critical of the box office hit to \u201cdo their own version of the NWA story\u201d. Elsewhere this week, he also defended Iggy Azalea\u2019s credibility as a rapper, saying she \u201cmakes dope songs\u201d. In fairness to Cube, most of us are guilty of having listened to Fancy at some point last year, though Iggy\u2019s 15 minutes of fame may soon be over. Sam Smith is going to sing the next Bond theme Warbling pop-soul singer Smith was finally confirmed to record the theme for forthcoming Bond film, Spectre. Smith first cyptically hinted at the new gig on Instagram on Sunday, before confirming the news on Tuesday with a followup post. He follows Adele to join the ranks of Tina Turner, Sheryl Crow (that one was a banger), Madonna and Shirley Bassey. \u201cThe name\u2019s Smith.

Damon Albarn thinks Adele\u2019s new album is a little dull  As the anticipation builds around Adele\u2019s long-delayed followup to 21, here\u2019s Damon Albarn to quash expectations. The Blur frontman says he worked with Adele on five songs, which may or may not be used for the album, now set to be released in November.

The conclusion of a new scientific study shows that, over the course of centuries, land currently inhabited by a billion people would be lost below water. \u201cFor the first time we have shown there is sufficient fossil fuel to melt all of Antarctica,\u201d said Ricarda Winkelmann, at the Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who led the research published in the journal Science Advances. \u201cThis would not happen overnight, but the mind-boggling point is that our actions today are changing the face of planet Earth as we know it, and will continue to do so for tens of thousands of years to come. If we want to avoid Antarctica to become ice-free, we need to keep coal, gas and oil in the ground.\u201d The Antarctic ice cap is the largest on Earth. But at the moment it contributes only about 10% of the sea level rise being driven by climate change as, despite warming, temperatures on the continent are still largely below freezing. But in May 2014, scientists concluded that a large part of the west Antarctic ice sheet is already doomed, because of the long-term effect of greenhouse gases already emitted into the atmosphere. Melting this part of the ice sheet would raise sea level by about four metres over the course of a few centuries. The new study shows that the much larger east Antarctic ice sheet would also melt eventually, if all the world\u2019s fossil fuel resources are extracted and burned. The work is based on detailed computer models that account for warming air and ocean temperatures, ice flow and potential changes in snowfall.  The research also shows that if global warming is restricted to the 2C rise, which is the limit targeted by the world\u2019s nations, sea level rise will be a few metres over the next millennia. That rate of change could allow countries to adapt to the rising tide, the scientists said. But in the extreme case in which all fossil fuels are burned and temperatures rise by over 10C, sea level would rise by 30cm a decade. \u201cHuman beings haven\u2019t experienced anything like that before,\u201d said Winkelmann. In this scenario, sea level would rise over 30m by the end of this millennium and to over 40m in the next millennium. The ultimate rise over several millennia would be close to 60m. \u201cBy using more and more fossil fuel energy, we increase the risk of triggering changes that we may not be able to stop or reverse in the future,\u201d said Anders Levermann, another member of the research team at the Potsdam Institute. \u201cThe west Antarctic ice sheet may already have tipped into a state of unstoppable ice loss, whether as a result of human activity or not.

Rather than an airy white room full of light, he has gone for the opposite: an extraordinary maze of underground cellars that were once the cooling warehouses for the Pfefferberg brewery. This cavernous labyrinth of huge, bare, brick-vaulted spaces serves as studio, store rooms, refectory and creative hub for Ai and his team, and in its Carthusian calm resembles a subterranean monastery. The place exudes a feeling of security but not necessarily of freedom.  Berlin is Ai\u2019s European base both for its geographical location and because his partner and six-year-old son live there. On his release from jail four years ago the authorities withheld his passport; it was returned to him only in July and Berlin was his first destination as a free man. On his arrival, the city greeted him as artist-activist royalty with a red-carpet welcome by the mayor and a teaching post at the University of the Arts. Berlin is also the place where many of the works that will be appearing at the Royal Academy\u2019s big autumn show, Ai\u2019s first major exhibition in Britain, were made. Like many successful artists, he operates a version of the traditional atelier system, with a crowd of assistants and fabricators producing his work. In this instance, although many of the pieces were conceived in his studio in China they just happen to have emerged some 6,000 miles away in the middle of Europe, courtesy of email, Skype and Twitter (Ai is an addict: in one year and a half period he once posted 60,000 tweets).   Related: Ai Weiwei tells of his lack of support from British government    There is nothing at ground level outside the studio to indicate that what lies beneath is the realm of such a celebrated figure \u2013 celebrated, it must be said, as much, if not more, for his human rights stance as for his art. One of the aims of the RA exhibition is to show what it is Ai actually makes. At the moment he is best known for his 2010-11 Sunflower Seeds installation at Tate Modern and the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium in Beijing, for which he was artistic consultant to the architectural team of Herzog &amp; de Meuron. Beyond that, most people would, one suspects, struggle to name an Ai work. After descending a series of staircases and traversing numerous echoing spaces, I find the artist in a long room lit by a light well, sitting like a Buddha and contemplating a cup of tea. For a man who has caused such a rumpus he appears a figure of immaculate calm; bearded and T-shirted, he is a media veteran who measures his words but nevertheless laughs easily.   Related: Herzog &amp;amp; de Meuron: and now for our next trick \u2026    I ask him first if the RA show would be very different had he been able to work in Berlin earlier. \u201cI selected the works years ago,\u201d he responds. \u201cIf I had a chance to choose them now I would still choose the same works.\u201d Going to London, though, will give him the opportunity to oversee the final stages of the display and also, to his slight dismay, take part in the razzmatazz of the opening. \u201cThe handshaking and the champagne are not what I\u2019m very good at, and if I have a chance to avoid them \u2026 because of the Chinese government I\u2019ve had over 100 shows that I haven\u2019t been able to attend over the past 10 years.\u201d The exhibition will focus on work from the past decade because, he says, \u201cso many things have happened \u2013 artistic and social and political. I have made works relating to my own experience, they reflect the place I have in China. I am most identified with struggle \u2013 physical or internal.\u201d In China he is an elephant in the room: his name is not supposed to be mentioned, he is under constant surveillance yet people know exactly who he is.     Tree installation from the Royal Academy exhibition. Photograph: Jens Ziehe/Photographie/Royal Academy    Ai\u2019s struggles with authority have a long provenance. His father, a poet, was exiled by Mao to the margins of the Gobi desert during the Cultural Revolution and the family grew up in extreme poverty. Ai\u2019s father was made to clean the public lavatories, the family was ostracised and, at one point, lived in a hole dug in the ground where the young Ai learned to make bricks from the earth (a history that makes the Berlin cellars less surprising, perhaps). Although Ai senior was later rehabilitated, the experience left his son with deeply equivocal feelings about the Chinese state. Although Ai had been a long-term critic of the authorities, his own problems escalated with the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 during which innumerable schools collapsed, killing thousands of students. The government tried to suppress the scale of the disaster, not least because so many of the schools were, as a result of widespread corruption, jerry-built (they were nicknamed \u201ctofu-dregs schools\u201d). Ai\u2019s response was to create a frieze composed of 9,000 children\u2019s backpacks (called, after one mother\u2019s memorial words to her child, She lived happily in this world for seven years), and another piece, Straight, comprising hundreds of steel reinforcing bars collected from the rubble. He also published the names of 5,000 of the dead schoolchildren. In the succeeding train of events the government shut down his blog, he was beaten so severely that he was hospitalised for a head wound (a cerebral haemorrhage), his studio in Shanghai was demolished for supposedly being built without the necessary permits, and he was imprisoned and investigated on charges of pornography, bigamy, tax avoidance and foreign currency irregularities. He has not, however, been convicted of any crime.    I told the police: 'Without you, I would never have become so noticeable as an artist'    It was these legal proceedings that lay behind the UK Home Office\u2019s initial refusal to grant Ai a British visa, on the grounds that he hadn\u2019t declared his non-existent criminal convictions. The decision caused an uproar and was quickly overturned by Theresa May. Did Ai fear that the refusal stemmed from the British government\u2019s desire not to upset the Chinese? \u201cIt was bureaucracy certainly,\u201d he says, weighing his words, \u201cbut it reflects, perhaps, certain attitudes of the government \u2026 When I was refused, the feeling was quite sensational because I had just opened a door\u201d \u2013 his Chinese passport had been returned \u2013 \u201cand then there was another door. But it was solved so quickly. I admire the British public, the media and the government \u2013 that\u2019s the benefit of a democratic society, a long-established civic society: everything can be solved.\u201d He laughs when I ask if his struggles have made him a better artist, but does acknowledge that they have changed him in a different way. \u201cThe police asked, very sincerely: \u2018Do we make you very famous in the world?\u2019 It is hard for them to ask this sort of question. I answered: \u2018Yes. Five years ago when I did Sunflower Seeds, if I walk in a London street nobody knows who Ai Weiwei is. Today, every day, people jump off their bicycles, little kids ask are you Ai Weiwei? I have become some sort of myth.\u2019 So I told the police: \u2018Without you, I would never have become so noticeable as an artist.\u2019 \u201d     The finishing touches are put to Ai Weiwei\u2019s \u2018Forever\u2019, by the Gherkin building, as part of the City of London\u2019s \u2018Sculpture in the City 2015\u2019 programme. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA    Fame, however, has been a shock: \u201cFor the past four and a half years, after my detention, I couldn\u2019t see it, I only heard that it was a phenomenon.\u201d Phenomenon is right: he was named the most powerful person in the art world by Art Review; when he was arrested V\u00e1clav Havel signed a letter calling for his release and he even has an asteroid named after him. Does he enjoy his celebrity? \u201cAnybody would be touched by a real emotion which says \u2018we support you, your effort\u2019. I\u2019m just an ordinary guy.\u201d But, I point out, he is very far from an ordinary guy. \u201cWell, I bear responsibility. I enjoy the recognition. It is not abstract. If you can use your power from art or freedom of expression to communicate with people, I think that is something beyond my imagination.\u201d So does he want to change China? \u201cArt is deeply rooted in every human being so certainly it can be used to change society. I think that is possible.\u201d Ai\u2019s art, the agent of this putative change, is based around the \u201creadymade\u201d, the genre pioneered early in the 20th century by his hero, Marcel Duchamp, in which everyday objects are repurposed as art. Ai\u2019s work is large scale and uses such items as wooden stools and bicycles which are joined together in great numbers to resemble giant structures, such as Crick and Watson\u2019s model of DNA. There is a series of Neolithic Chinese vases that he has dipped in lividly bright commercial paint, so that the modern colours drip down the ancient shapes. There is antique Chinese furniture that has been cut and rejointed with perfect craftsmanship at strange, unstable angles. Visitors to the RA will pass through a courtyard containing a forest of seven metre-tall trees, each constructed from the limbs of numerous other dead trees \u2013 a \u00a3100,000 project funded by crowdsourcing. Then there is his photography and architecture too.         Ai Weiwei and the Han vase.    \u201cChina itself is a sort of readymade,\u201d Ai says; \u201cIts history, its current struggle, its painful struggle \u2013 I make works relating to that.\u201d Is he then a Chinese artist or a global one? \u201cI am a global artist,\u201d he responds, \u201cbut with Chinese characteristics \u2013 that\u2019s what communists always say: we should build \u2018socialism with Chinese characteristics\u2019. The kind of ideology I identify with, though, is modernism.\u201d Modernism for Ai is not the historical movement of Duchamp, the Cubists, Mondrian, Le Corbusier et al but an ongoing project. \u201cWe are the fortunate children of the past,\u201d he says, but also \u201cnew humans, we are created by the new technology and the new possibilities. And a new language of form, sensitivity, emotions is needed to cope with our self-consciousness and identities.\u201d That new language will not involve, as it once did, being photographed dropping a 2,000 year-old Han vase or indeed the overpainting of Neolithic vases. Ai looks vaguely embarrassed when I mention this destructiveness, so surprising in someone who felt the full effect of the anti-historical Cultural Revolution. Those works, he says, reflected his early response to \u201chuman assumptions towards the value of the past\u201d. \u201cI did them as a joke, an act. In the early 1990s I never thought there was a chance of there being such a thing as a public artist again.\u201d He didn\u2019t think they would be seen. Would he do the same again? \u201cI\u2019m not interested in that sort of attitude any more.\u201d They were, he agrees, a young man\u2019s statement. He also once claimed that being an artist is like being a virus. The phrase makes him uncomfortable (\u201cMy mind is sometimes so awkward and I have this sense that I have to give some sort of explanation\u201d) but he doesn\u2019t disavow his virus status. \u201cThere is,\u201d he says, \u201cno way to stop me. It\u2019s not possible. The only way to stop me is to put me away. They tried and that didn\u2019t work that well.\u201d     Although many people are involved in the construction of the works, Ai Weiwei\u2019s art is not collaborative. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Are you then in a battle with the government, I ask. \u201cFor a moment I felt I\u2019m like a chess player and I\u2019m going to win the game. I no longer think that way. I haven\u2019t lost the confidence but if the table is going to be overthrown and you\u2019re going to be put in a dark basement, then you think again about the game.\u201d He later likens the situation to a boxing match, with the return of his passport marking a break between rounds: \u201cBut it is not a boxing match for 12 rounds but for 120 rounds.\u201d Ai lives, he says, in a permanent state of anxiety and doubt. Partly because of the possibility of rearrest and because his acts have consequences for those around him: \u201cWith many of my close friends, my lawyers, my allies, my colleagues still in jail \u2013 not sentenced after a year and a half \u2013 that would make anybody hesitate.\u201d Not that this changes his provocateur stance: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change my beliefs. My actions would only be changed if my own method of defence is shown not to work really well.\u201d He is anxious too because that is his artistic nature. Of his work, he notes that \u201cYou have to feel it\u2019s a little bit impossible, you don\u2019t want to know you\u2019re going to win. If you do there\u2019s not a challenge there.\u201d He has responsibilities to his team too, a core of some 40 people rising to 100 when the various fabricators are added in. Ai\u2019s art, however, is not collaborative. \u201cI\u2019m the one who makes all the decisions, covers every inch, every setting, material, paragraph, I try to do as much as I can. That\u2019s why I never have a vacation. Weekends, I don\u2019t go to church. I work seven days a week, I\u2019m always the first one in the office, at seven, and the last one to leave, at midnight or one o\u2019clock.\u201d     \u2018Coloured Vases\u2019, 2015. Photograph: PR/Royal Academy    Given the scale, labour intensiveness and sheer cost of making his art (he has a roster of dealers around the world: whatever Ai\u2019s art is about it is also about money), he must be racked with doubts. Sunflower Seeds, for example, was no jeu d\u2019esprit but was two and a half years in the making and involved 1,600 craftsmen and women to paint the 100m porcelain seeds, each of which represented 13 people (adding up to the entire population of China). In such a project there is no room for second thoughts halfway through. \u201cI question the whole time,\u201d Ai says. \u201cYou have to defend your own position. So if you find a work is too weak or it won\u2019t become what you originally thought \u2026 that\u2019s the worst time. You really have to trust what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Or, in one of the many gnomic metaphors that pepper his conversation, \u201cA baby isn\u2019t born as a soldier or fighter, it has to go through a very long practice, that can be a very dark, very terrible period of time but it is so rewarding, every time you have that difficulty it becomes a work you feel better about \u2026 The child who likes to cry becomes the child you give more love to \u2013 a Chinese saying \u2013 well, art is like that\u201d And, on a roll now: \u201cThe harvest doesn\u2019t become a harvest unless you work on the fields the whole time.\u201d Given the stress inherent in both his activist life and in producing big-sweep art, I ask him if he ever makes small-scale, personal pieces, about his partner and child, perhaps, or about love and intimacy. In a convoluted metaphor he explains that \u201cI tell people I\u2019m just like a plumber, and people in my building call me up and say my pipe\u2019s leaking, can you come up? The toilet won\u2019t flush, will you come? But I\u2019m also very good at biochemistry but no one in the whole building calls me for that. There\u2019s no need for a biochemist but there is for plumbers. So I have become like a skilful, expert plumber.\u201d A plumber, it seems, is the artist he is, a biochemist is the artist he could be. In the end Ai gives up on the metaphor too. \u201cTo answer your question, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be pretty good at doing things about the people I care for but I\u2019d rather leave that [sort of art] for others.\u201d He describes his family as \u201cpart of me\u201d. What visitors to the RA exhibition will see is the work of someone who believes that art no longer works in \u201cthe old way, with a few masters, but of different fields full of discoveries\u201d \u2013 made by a plumber who dreams of being a biochemist. \u2022 \u2018Ai Weiwei\u2019 is at the Royal Academy, London W1, from 19 September to 13 December. royalacademy.com.", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "Sculpture", "Ceramics", "Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Royal Academy of Arts", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-12T08:00:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/13/future-of-food-how-we-cook", "sentences": ["Having recently taken to the stage at the Consumer Electronics Show in Shanghai, Moley Robotics\u2019s kitchen is hot stuff, but it\u2019s not the only machine donning an apron."], "title": "Future of food: how we cook", "article": "ROBO-CHEF Waiting for the right moment to reach for the next ingredient, Moley Robotics\u2019s robo-chef moves its arms as if in a shrug. It\u2019s a peculiarly human gesture \u2013 but according to its creator, Mark Oleynik, therein lies its appeal. Who\u2019d want an impersonal mechanical box whipping up your dinner when you can have a lifelike \u2014 albeit torso-less \u2014 android instead?

Photograph: PR    For Oleynik, the vision is to produce a hi-tech solution to an everyday domestic issue. With the tap of an app, he reveals, the evening meal can be chosen and the timing set, allowing the robotic kitchen to have dinner on the go by the time you get home. The commercial version is set to debut in 2018 for around $75,000 (\u00a349,000), featuring an expanded repertoire of meals that owners can add to (although they, too, will have to motion-capture their movements) and a greater range of functions \u2014 at the moment human chefs need to prepare the ingredients, putting them in just the right place for the mechanical hands to grab. A built-in fridge and a dishwasher that can be stacked by the robot are also on the menu. But will it find a place in our homes? Oleynik believes so.   Related: The robot cookbook: can a supercomputer write recipes?    \u201cIf you say, \u2018In your home you can now choose any dish you want\u2019, I am not sure that you will find people say, \u2018No, I don\u2019t need it\u2019,\u201d he says. Having recently taken to the stage at the Consumer Electronics Show in Shanghai, Moley Robotics\u2019s kitchen is hot stuff, but it\u2019s not the only machine donning an apron. IBM\u2019s big-brained computer, Watson, is being harnessed by chefs to churn out new recipes, while San Francisco company Momentum Machines have created a robot capable of making burgers, cooking them and preparing toppings before popping the final product in a bag. From home meals to fast food, tech, it seems, has cooking all wrapped up.ND 3D-PRINTED FOOD \u201cWe think that within 10 to 15 years, 3D food printers will be a standard kitchen appliance, like the microwave,\u201d says Lynette Kucsma, co-founder of Natural Machines, the Barcelona company that produces the Foodini, a cutting-edge 3D food printer.     Natural Machines\u2019 mini-burgers. Photograph: PR    This is clearly early stage technology, but watching the Foodini produce a perfect hexagonal wall of mashed potato in the kitchen of the Michelin-starred restaurant where it is being trialled shows its potential, certainly when it comes to food presentation. The machine looks like a large microwave and inside are a set of capsules for the ingredients. In this case, you put mashed potato in one capsule, choose a nozzle size and a design and press go. Within two minutes, out comes mashed potato, exactly as you put it in, but in an interesting shape.     One of Natural Machines\u2019 3D-printed designer dishes. Photograph: PR    The machine is getting attention from top restaurant chefs who are always looking for creative and original ways of presenting food in the tradition of the culinary trompe l\u2019oeil pioneered by Ferran Adri\u00e0. \u201cAnything that requires shaping or layering, from simple bread sticks to more complex ravioli, that\u2019s where 3D food printing comes into play,\u201d Kucsma says. \u201cThere are also designs the machine can produce that, no matter how steady your hand, you couldn\u2019t do yourself. What chefs are doing is printing part of the dish and adding to it afterwards.\u201d   Related: 3D-food printer offers the prospect of hamburgers printed to go    It could also be fun with children, who can be persuaded to eat food they wouldn\u2019t otherwise eat if it\u2019s presented in an imaginative way. However, at $1,500 (\u00a3975), when it begins to ship early next year, it may be some time before the Foodini becomes the must-have appliance.\u201cThe idea of a 3D printer conjures up images of processed food, but that\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d Kucsma says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about fresh ingredients, these are your recipes, you don\u2019t have to change anything. We\u2019re never going to force people to buy prepared food capsules or add chemicals, like with other printers. It\u2019s all about real food.\u201d One of the Foodini\u2019s selling points is it can make a filled ravioli in two minutes, not bad for what is a fussy operation when done by hand. But as anyone who has tried it at home knows, making good pasta dough that doesn\u2019t come out either too dry or too rubbery isn\u2019t as easy as you\u2019d think. So the ravioli the Foodini produces will only be as good as the dough you put in. It will not make you a better cook.     The Foodini itself. Photograph: PR    What makes the Foodini different is it produces a range of sweet and savoury foods with multiple ingredients. \u201cThe first machine we\u2019re releasing doesn\u2019t cook,\u201d says Kucsma. \u201cIt can heat but it doesn\u2019t cook. We\u2019re working on one that can cook and will be able to produce a three-course meal.\u201d Kucsma says that she and her business partner, Emilio Sep\u00falveda, are getting a lot of interest from chefs, hotels and caterers in China and the US.  They also responded to Nasa\u2019s interest in 3D food printing by producing a 3D pizza in five minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the Foodini will be in space,\u201d Kucsma says. \u201cThere are challenges, like no gravity, and there are issues about weight and micro-organisms. It\u2019s not our number one priority but it\u2019s an interesting market. Really, what we\u2019re looking to do is get people back in the kitchen and making food with fresh ingredients.\u201dSB SMART OVEN I am watching food porn on an iPhone in the office of a San Francisco startup \u2013 a birds-eye view of baking chocolate chip cookies gently rising. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get that experience with a traditional oven,\u201d says Nikhil Bhogal proudly. He is the co-founder and chief technology officer of June, a modern appliance company that recently unveiled its $1,495 (\u00a3972) smart oven of the same name for pre-order. It will begin shipping in spring 2016.     The June oven. Photograph: PR    The oven, which includes an internal camera in its roof, does more than promise a new era of food voyeurism. The prototype we are watching knew when the cookies had been placed inside and also how to bake them to perfection (14 minutes at 325F was its recommendation). When done, it will turn itself off and alert the iPhonephone app through which the oven\u2019s basic functions can be remotely controlled (the company is working on an Android app, though it is not expected before shipping). \u201cThis is going to go down in history as the first kitchen appliance which was artificially intelligent,\u201d says Bhogal, adding he doesn\u2019t believe kitchens have seen as big a paradigm shift since the invention of the microwave.         A promotional video for the June oven.    The oven\u2019s software was taught using algorithms to recognise different foods, by being shown example images again and again. It knew what chocolate chip cookie dough was because it has seen close to 1,000 samples and learned the common features.  Once the oven has recognised a food it uses a cooking program based on experiments conducted by June\u2019s resident chef. Because the same food can come in different shapes, sizes and densities, as well as start out at different temperatures, a built-in oven scale weighs items and the camera allows for counting. There are also temperature probes, designed to be inserted into foods such as meat, fish, pies and bread loaves to ensure thorough cooking or a preferred level of \u201cdoneness\u201d. So far the oven recognises 26 foods from steak to chocolate cake, but June is working to increase this, says Bhogal. It is also experimenting with thinner probes that will work with smaller items like cookies.  Will it become a mainstay of future kitchens? There is a cultural shift under way where people want to be more connected with their food and experiment in the kitchen, believes Bhogal.\u201cThis is going to be technology which helps this [tech savvy] generation rediscover the joy of cooking,\u201d he says. At least, that is, if they\u2019re willing to follow what the oven knows. ZC MORE COOKING GADGETS     The SITU smart scale.

The Dalai Lama, who turned 80 this year, also criticised China\u2019s \u201cpolitics of suppression\u201d, which he said makes it impossible for people to express their real views. The Chinese government has said it will designate the next Dalai Lama, rather than the figurehead being chosen through the traditional method where Buddhist monks identify their reincarnated spiritual leader after his death. The Beijing regime routinely vilifies the Dalai Lama \u2013 who has lived in exile in India since 1959 \u2013 over his demands for greater autonomy for Tibet. China says his true intention is independence for Tibet, and it strongly objects to heads of state, dignitaries and high-profile figures meeting with him.   Related: China unhappy at Cameron's meeting with Dalai Lama    The Dalai Lama is to meet MPs at the invitation of the all-party parliamentary group on Tibet, of which the new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a member. The group exists to pressure the government \u201cto encourage negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile, whilst recognising that Tibet is an occupied country which had independent links with Britain\u201d. There are no scheduled meetings with David Cameron or any government ministers. The Dalai Lama\u2019s visit comes just a month before the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is due to travel to Britain for the first state visit in 10 years. Cameron and his then coalition partner, Nick Clegg, met the Dalai Lama in 2012, triggering a furious response from the Chinese, who accused the government of \u201cconniving at and supporting separatist attempts to achieve Tibetan independence\u201d. The following year Cameron led a large trade delegation to China, partly to repair the diplomatic damage over the Dalai Lama meeting. At the time, Downing Street said the prime minister had \u201cturned a page\u201d on the issue and had no plans to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader in the future.

His vision is weirdly glossy, with the story set in the 70s (the book was published in 1975); the combination of the low-ish budget production values and the wry tone makes the film feel like a pastiche.  \nCrucially, the delineation of the class system isn\u2019t made clear, so the breakdown feels like a non-event. Luke Evans plays Richard Wilder, a lower floor resident who \u2013 in the book \u2013 starts an ascent that makes for a twisted take on class-hopping. He\u2019s murderous and repellent, but he\u2019s aspirational, and this lends a sense of order to the chaos. Here \u2013 thrown into a stylistic orgy of campy nihilism \u2013 Wilder just feels like another of the players.  \nHiddleston surfs the confusion with ease. His tendency to look detached works well in a setting where the rules have been thrown to the wind. Amy Jump\u2019s script fleshes out Laing, painting him as the most dangerous type of man of all: a man who sees the world falling apart around him and does nothing but learn how to adapt. Among the useful items he picks up on his trip around the tower are Wilder\u2019s wife, Helen (Elisabeth Moss) and Charlotte Melville (Sienna Milller), a pragmatist who sees the fall coming and learns the new rules quickly. Miller is on good form here, corroding Melville\u2019s essential decency as the uproar roils on. \nWheatley has made High-Rise his story, instead of Ballard\u2019s. That\u2019s fine \u2013 but, unfortunately, it\u2019s a less interesting take. The director\u2019s puckishness starts to grate pretty quickly. In one scene a gang of Royal\u2019s armed enforcers roam the upper floors. One of their weapons is a Bafta statuette. The in-joke feels brash, rather than clever. \nIn some ways this is a creative adventure. It shows Wheatley for the first time stretching his talent to fit a film with stars and expectation. It\u2019s not a disaster, but the faults stack up. It took nearly 40 years for High-Rise to make it to big screen. After all that time, this is a bit of a dog\u2019s dinner.", "tags": ["High-Rise", "Film", "Toronto film festival", "Toronto film festival 2015", "Culture", "Festivals", "Tom Hiddleston", "Ben Wheatley", "Sienna Miller", "JG Ballard", "Film adaptations", "Books", "Thriller", "Drama", "Luke Evans"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-14T17:26:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/14/ai-weiwei-royal-academy-review-momentous-and-moving", "sentences": ["Thinking Ai might shut up after his 81-day incarceration in 2011, and the bulldozing of his newly completed Shanghai studio by the authorities, the Chinese government got it wrong.", "In the same room as the crabs, the artist has built a wall, made from the rubble of his studio, which had originally been sanctioned and encouraged by the Shanghai authorities."], "title": "Ai Weiwei review \u2013 momentous and moving", "article": "Three-thousand porcelain river crabs clamber over one another in a great red, green and white sprawl of twitching legs and claws. Porcelain sunflower seeds are one thing, crabs another. Good thing they\u2019re not quite real. This is but one small moment in the largest show Ai Weiwei has held in Britain. Not exactly a retrospective, it is certainly the best show of his work I have seen anywhere, as well as being the best thing I\u2019ve seen at the Royal Academy, London, for years. It is filled with surprises, shocks and tremors. Its effect is cumulative. Those who have doubted Ai\u2019s integrity and seriousness (I have never been among them), or his qualities as an artist, should find plenty to pause at here.  The word for crab, hie xie, is a homonym for harmonious, we are told, and much bandied about in Chinese government circles. There\u2019s not much harmony here among the crustaceans. The word is also used a lot on the internet in China, as slang for censorship. Thinking Ai might shut up after his 81-day incarceration in 2011, and the bulldozing of his newly completed Shanghai studio by the authorities, the Chinese government got it wrong.  In the same room as the crabs, the artist has built a wall, made from the rubble of his studio, which had originally been sanctioned and encouraged by the Shanghai authorities. Within it are fragments of decorated wooden supports from a much earlier, Qing dynasty building. Carved birds rest on carved branches, among leaves and flowers and the reclaimed rubble. Ai\u2019s art, for all its references to minimalism and conceptualism, has always been grounded in his own experience and his place in Chinese society. His outspokenness on social issues, and on the development of Chinese society, are not at odds with this.     Not quite real \u2026 Ai Weiwei\u2019s porcelain river crabs    A dark, smoothly finished work in ironwood sits on the floor. It is like an unrolled carpet, still rucked with folds across its width, which come at you like ripples as you enter Ai\u2019s show. Called Bed, it is really a map, but you have to lie down next to it to see along its length, and appreciate how the edge traces the geography of China\u2019s border, with its snaggly promontories and indentations. We follow the coastline and numerous internal borders. By now my clothes are dusty, even before I notice how this huge timber construction is made from innumerable sections, all perfectly dovetailed into one another in a complex of saw-cut meetings across and through the grain. How things are made matters in Ai\u2019s work as much as what is being made, unmade and remade. This is more than a matter of recognising or demonstrating the consummate skills of Chinese woodwork and cabinet-making, marble-carving, metal-working, modelling and casting. Such skills, with their long history, are not redundant, even though so much has been lost in China\u2019s surge to modernity, in a fog of pollution and destruction.  Not so much a maker of things as a director, a commissioner, an orchestrator, Ai understands the specifics of matter and materials, of what they signify as well as what they can do. Lots of artists possess enviable skills \u2013 no matter how many people complain that artists now are no longer trained in the business of artisanal or technical skill. Most are trained in the business of business, and Ai is that, too. He is not the one who carves the jade and marble, or cuts the wood, or fashions a butterfly joint.   Related: Ai Weiwei \u2013 from criminal to art-world superstar    Much of Ai\u2019s work is also about recycling: the grove of bare trees that stands in the RA\u2019s courtyard has been constructed from the mismatched trunks and branches of felled trees, each an amalgam of sawn and dovetailed parts. Among them sits a battered padded vinyl or leather armchair. From a distance, it looks as if it has been rescued from a skip. In fact, it has been carved from striated black marble. The wood for Bed is recycled from Qing dynasty timber. The conjoined arrangement of acrobatic wooden stools, and the tables that take a sudden right angle, so one pair of its legs rest on the wall, are reworked from original pieces of furniture rather than built from scratch. These playful, useless objects hark back to Marcel Duchamp, although Ai always affects some kind of radical transformation. Elsewhere, we find silicone sex-toy buttplugs and anal balls remade in carved jade; a child\u2019s stroller carved from marble sitting on a marble field of grass; a perfectly detailed marble gas mask carved from the same hunk of marble it sits on.  All this is more than a clever double-take, or an updated version of the Chinoiserie produced by the ton for the western market in the 18th and 19th centuries. If these were just conversation pieces, and demonstrations of skilful toil, that would be the end of it. Although Ai\u2019s work is dependent on the Duchampian readymade and the found object, and the reworked manners of minimal art, he brings to this language something crucial and acute.      Old meets new \u2026 for Coloured Vases, Ai dips ancient pottery into paint    There have always been questions about whether minimalism was itself authoritarian and somehow anti-human in its regularity, with its preference for the grid and the machine-made surface. Ai has always turned this around. A group of cubes comprise a sheer-sided ton block of compacted tea, a delightfully carved enlargement of a small ebony box his poet father once gave him, and an intricate puzzle box with hidden, sliding and interlocking compartments for treasure. Looking inside this is like looking into a model of a mind. Even the pallets on which the objects sit are perfectly jointed and planed timber.  If there is an object fetish at work here, it can also encompass destruction. The neolithic and Qing dynasty pots he dips in drooling industrial paint gain as much as they lose. Some in any case were bought as fakes \u2013 albeit fakes that were made with the same repertoire of skills that went into the originals. For all their lurid colour, they are still in their way beautiful, satisfying forms. An arrangement of tall, rusted steel boxes fills another gallery. Each has a door, a window or two, and a hole on the top through which one can stare down, as though through a skylight. Inside, you can see the grim conditions of Ai\u2019s 2011 imprisonment: these half-scale models of his prison \u2013 he was forbidden to discuss it, but remembered the place down to the smallest detail \u2013 show scenes of his nightmarish life there. Two guards watch him at every moment, but do not communicate with him, as he eats, sleeps, defecates and showers. We see him interrogated. Nothing really happens except this awful proximity. Everything is modelled in numbing detail, from the wretched bathroom to the plastic-covered furniture, the bowls of food, the uniforms. The scenes are vertiginous and awful. What cannot be spoken about is turned into silent images.   Related: Art, design and architecture: what to see in autumn 2015    Ai\u2019s show is a rollercoaster. The pace never lets up. What holds it all in check is the reserve of the objects themselves. The exhibition builds, returns, develops. A room with an acrobatic dance of stools and furniture doing impossible things is followed by the wails, shouts and screams of Ai\u2019s video Little Girl\u2019s Cheeks in the next and largest gallery at the RA. The film opens in the confused aftermath of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The footage is extremely upsetting. We see dead children and attempts at resuscitation, grieving families, speechless rescue teams. Bodies and schoolbags are strewn about in the rubble. We see groups of visiting officials in their suits. Some even smile. We see building inspectors aghast at the shoddy \u201ctofu-dregs\u201d construction of the collapsed schools and overhear phonecalls to stonewalling public offices.  The film also follows the process of making the work that now fills the gallery. Ai managed to reclaim over 150 tonnes of the twisted steel that was meant to reinforce the concrete structures that collapsed. He employed a team to straighten the rods and return them to an almost pristine state. These have now been stacked across the floor, creating a kind of landscape of longer, shorter, thicker and thinner bars, rising a few inches from the floor. They create a kind of plain, a low fissured relief. It goes on and on, like a landscape sheered by tectonic forces. On the walls on both sides of this implacable and dour arrangement is a gridded list of the names of the dead children, all 5,196 of them. Art without a human dimension is impossible. Sometimes the obvious needs to be stated. What a great and moving show.  \u2022 Ai Weiwei is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, 19 September to 13 December.

A new problem is all too often seen as an intimation of impending crisis, a hard landing, consequent social instability, and perhaps the eventual collapse of the regime. Dream on.   Related: Chinese economy is under pressure but will not slump, says premier Li Keqiang    The bears, it goes without saying, have a dreadful record. After 35 years of extraordinary economic growth, China is still growing at 7% annually. True, that is lower than before, but still at a rate that dwarfs anything in the west. One of the great weaknesses of so much western economic commentary is that it fails to look much beyond the next quarter\u2019s, or even month\u2019s, results. In contrast the Chinese understand where they have come from, where they are and where they need to go. Nor are they complacent: the Chinese leadership readily admits it faces quite new economic challenges. It is instructive then to look at China\u2019s global role since the financial crisis. When the western economies were on their knees in 2007-08, the Chinese economy rode to the rescue. Although the actions of the Beijing government were primarily motivated by self-interest \u2013 avoiding being dragged down by the crisis \u2013 they also had the effect of saving the western economies from a fate far worse. Confronted by the near-collapse of their western markets,, which accounted for around half of Chinese exports at the time, China embarked on a huge $586bn stimulus programme to boost domestic demand and offset the loss in demand for their exports. It worked. The Chinese growth rate continued to expand at around 10% and thereby provided a major boost to the global economy. Furthermore, following those dark days, the Chinese have allowed their currency, the renminbi, to steadily appreciate, by more than 25% against the dollar since 2005 and considerably more against most other currencies. As a result Chinese exports have become considerably less competitive and have fallen. Meanwhile its current account surplus has dropped dramatically, from 10.1% of GDP in 2007 to 2.1% last year. Imagine the effect on other economies if the opposite had happened and the renminbi had been devalued by 25%. The growing importance of the Chinese economy for the health of the global economy is illustrated by the fact that America\u2019s GDP has grown by just over 10% since 2008, while over the same period China\u2019s has increased by about 66%.    The western world continues to depend on a life-support system, namely zero interest rates, combined with Chinese growth    That said, the Chinese readily accept that the stimulus programme has led to a multitude of acute problems: chronic over-investment in industries responsible for infrastructure, excessive debt, a property market overhang and growing financial problems in local government. They are also deeply aware that the stimulus has served to delay the most urgent economic challenge of all: a structural shift in the Chinese economy. As a result, Beijing has found itself fighting on two very different fronts at the same time: the severe short-term problems posed by the stimulus programme and the long-term imperative of a structural shift. The rebalancing of the Chinese economy is making surprisingly rapid progress. In 2014, the share of services in China\u2019s GDP was 48.2%, comfortably ahead of the 42.6% accounted for by manufacturing and construction, with the gap steadily widening. Despite the fall in the growth rate to around 7%, employment has remained buoyant: the reason is that the service sector absorbs relatively more people than manufacturing, since it is more labour-intensive, together with the fact that the working-age population is declining annually by 3 million. There is also now much evidence that the Chinese economy is becoming increasingly innovative. Online shopping, led by Alibaba, already accounts for more than 10% of retail sales and is growing at 40% per annum. China\u2019s express delivery and internet financial services are world-class and in sectors such as advanced machinery equipment, electrical machinery and smartphones Chinese firms are rapidly catching up with the global leaders: Xiaomi, for instance, is now selling more smartphones in China than Apple. Nor should we ignore China\u2019s energy revolution: wind, water and solar power now account for nearly a third of its total electricity generation capacity, a remarkable achievement.   Related: China plans stock market 'circuit breaker' to curb volatility    The western preoccupation with headline GDP figures overlooks this deeper structural shift. Ultimately it is the ability of the Chinese economy to make the transition from a labour-intensive, investment-led, export-oriented economy to one based on value-added production and domestic consumption that will be crucial to its long-term future. This, however, should not deflect attention from the short-term risks. China\u2019s chronic debt problem \u2013 partly corporate (especially in infrastructural-related industries, such as steel, that have 30-40% excess capacity); partly property (the result of an explosion in construction, with many buildings remaining empty); partly financial (the growing inability of borrowers to pay back their debts, especially in the shadow banking sector) \u2013 could lead to a massive deleveraging and consequent economic contraction. One of the great problems facing the Chinese leadership is that it is facing several serious challenges all at the same time. If it backtracks on restructuring and rebalancing to provide short-term economic stimulus and shore up the growth rate, this will only store up much more serious problems for the future. If it mishandles the debt problem China could conceivably have the hard landing that it has so skilfully avoided over the last few decades. In short, the new Chinese leadership is confronted with serious overload. Add to this China\u2019s enormously ambitious infrastructure project, One Belt One Road, America\u2019s blatant attempt to contain China and China\u2019s more assertive foreign policy, especially in east Asia, and the danger of over-reach becomes apparent. China\u2019s leadership, unsurprisingly given the circumstances, has made one serious error: its ill-conceived and mistaken intervention to try to reverse the sell-off on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, from which it now appears to have largely backtracked. In the event, however, it was the resulting plunge in western markets that was far more revealing and significant. Its message was threefold. First, the west is concerned about the state of China\u2019s economy. Second, it was a dramatic illustration of just how important China now is to the global economy, in many ways greater than the US. Even five years ago such an event would have been unimaginable: China has arrived big time. And third, it reminded everyone of the underlying fragility of the western economy, the fact that it has never recovered from the financial crisis, that the latter ushered in a new era of what Larry Summers has called secular stagnation. The western world continues to depend on a life-support system, namely zero interest rates, combined with Chinese growth. What if the latter falters? That is why western markets have suddenly started panicking. In Beijing there is concern, not panic.

Despite the sweat trickling down his brow \u2013 evidence of the relentless Indian summer \u2013 the smile on his face seems genuine. Soon two more boys are crowded around the car, competing for my attention. Perplexed at the sight of hawkers on a highway, I strain to see what they are trying to sell me. They thrust blue and red brochures on my windscreen, mouthing something I can\u2019t catch. Lowering the window, I hear a cacophony of voices attempting to sell me a new property: \u201cWe offer a two-bedroom flat for only 22 lakh rupees [\u00a321,500], ma\u2019am!\u201d \u201cWe have better amenities and a brilliant location to boot, ma\u2019am!\u201d \u201cMa\u2019am, our company has been building flats for more than 20 years and has a brilliant reputation!\u201d The scene is reminiscent of vegetable vendors hawking in crowded market places throughout India. The informality with which the boys are selling property worth millions of rupees makes the flats sound like cheap, dispensable goods. All day long, they sit in tiny, makeshift plastic shelters on the highway pavement, awaiting cars driving down from Delhi. When a car stops after they wave it to a halt (most regular commuters do not), the boys hurriedly put their case forward \u2013 plots of land at throwaway prices; yet-to-be-constructed apartments that will fulfil a house owner\u2019s dream.

Photograph: Raksha Kumar    The exchange is not instant. If a customer shows interest, the boys take their phone numbers and a senior executive from the company gets in touch. According to the boys, they manage to hail down at least seven or eight cars every day. Once stopped, most people apparently give their contact details. I feel that I have glimpsed the undecorated face of India\u2019s urban expansion: desperate, all-consuming, ruthless. The goliath driving this expansion is the US $1bn Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), touted as the world\u2019s largest infrastructure project. While the project was conceived in 2009 by the previous Congress-led government, current prime minister Narendra Modi has made it one of his leadership\u2019s top priorities. The corridor claims it will urbanise 12% of India over the next 30 years. \u201cWhen a maelstrom approaches, it uproots even larger trees,\u201d says land-rights activist Sagar Rabari, of the dramatic changes the proposed corridor is expected to inflict on the people and landscape of western India. \u201cWhat hope can the small shrubs harbour?\u201d     Initial funding for the DMIC has been shared between the governments of India and Japan. Photograph: Manpreet Romana/AFP/Getty    Dadri: land of speculation I decide to set out and meet some of these \u201csmall shrubs\u201d: the people currently living along the proposed Delhi-Mumbai corridor, whose lives may be about to alter radically and irrevocably. My starting point is the town of Dadri, near Delhi. According to the DMIC proposals, a high-speed railway line, exclusively for freight, will begin here and run south-west for 1,500km across six states, down to India\u2019s largest container port, near Mumbai. Six airports, 23 manufacturing centres, two huge electricity generating units, two ports and a six-lane expressway are also planned, forming the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Furthermore, 24 new \u201csmart\u201d cities will be sprinkled along the railway\u2019s route \u2013 with each city expected to house anywhere between one and three million people. The timetable is severe: the initial \u201cdedicated freight corridor\u201d has been given a deadline for completion of 2017. My car positively glides over the smooth, wide roads as I depart the eastern Delhi neighbourhood of Anand Vihar. Yet by the time I reach Dadri, 30km east of the capital, in the unruly neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, potholes have taken over the roads completely, highways are lined with large wheat fields, and rural India has officially arrived. Aside from its busy container depot \u2013 which stores and transports huge metallic containers full of agricultural products, steel and spare parts for the automotive industries \u2013 Dadri has a laid-back feel. There are traditional seating areas outside the town\u2019s small houses, where people relax with their cups of tea and savouries. Most of its residents are farmers who grow wheat and vegetables. But the town\u2019s proximity to Delhi guarantees residents that their days of relaxed rural living are numbered. The proposed new industrial corridor is already changing the contours of this region.     Trucks in the container depot at Dadri, starting point for the planned high-speed railway line to Mumbai. Photograph: Raksha Kumar    The premise of the DMIC is that urbanisation is inevitable \u2013 based on a 2010 Mckinsey report that predicted 350 million Indians would move to urban centres over the next 30 years. As it stands, most of India\u2019s larger cities are already spilling over and cannot take much more migration. Many were planned a century ago; others were not planned at all, and have grown entirely organically. DMIC proponents believe building planned cities and manufacturing centres along the corridor will sustain urbanisation for a long time, facilitating the continued growth of the country\u2019s economy. When the plans were announced in this region, however, it opened the gates to land speculators and the controversial prospect of gentrification. Many of the farmers I meet in Dadri say that spotting land agents in their villages was the first sign their land was suddenly in demand. These agents broker deals between farmers and developers who want to take over the land for non-agricultural purposes. Villagers tell me about the land agents who appear noiselessly in their villages just before a major infrastructure project is announced. Six years ago, Ashok Mavee heard that a new arterial road was to be constructed through Dadri, his home town. \u201cI thought giving up my land would make me rich, given how much compensation we were being offered,\u201d Mavee says.  Some of his agricultural land was required by the state to construct the new highway; the rest of his land would border it, which didn\u2019t bode well for his crops. Mavee decided to give up all his land in 2009 at the the state\u2019s compensation price of 1.2m rupees (\u00a311,750) per acre. His rain-dependent crops were failing anyway, and he hoped to start a stationery shop in a near by town with the money. Today, the land that Mavee once owned costs six times that sale price, as the arterial highway nears completion.

Photograph: Raksha Kumar    \u201cWhen there is connectivity and support infrastructure, land prices will obviously shoot up,\u201d says Rishit Neogi, a Delhi-based land-rights activist. In fact, it seems this dynamic of land-price inflation is underpinning the entire DMIC plan. Of the stated US $100bn that is required for the entire project, the government of India has pledged a mere US $4.5bn, with the Japanese government promising an equal amount. That\u2019s quite a shortfall to the ultimate cost \u2013 yet the project\u2019s leaders are confident they can execute the entire scheme without having to go back to the Indian government for more money.  \u201cOur aim is to maximise infrastructure development with minimal government funding,\u201d explains Tallen Kumar, CEO of the DMIC Development Corporation. With the existing funding fraction, Kumar says the project will build basic infrastructure such as roads, water pipelines, sewage lines and waste collection. Land prices around this new infrastructure are bound to spike, he continues, at which point that land will be sold at a premium to those who can afford it \u2013 with the proceeds being used to construct more of the project. Perhaps this also explains the desperation with which the young hawkers surrounded my car that scorching July morning. There is a lot of land to be sold to people with cars \u2013 and unless it is bought up, this juggernaut of urbanisation could yet stall.  In Dadri today, 12- to 14-storey residential buildings stand on what was once Mavee\u2019s land, with each apartment costing around \u00a319,500. Mavee cannot afford any of them: \u201cI sold the land because I was told the state would force the land away from me in any case,\u201d he tells me. The Indian government has a legal right to acquire lands for infrastructure projects \u2013although new guidelines for the compensation of former owners are currently being debated in parliament. People have long feared that their land will be taken away by force if they protest. For his part, Mavee moved to a village 75km from Dadri. \u201cMy grandfather owned some land in the town of Greater Noida [close to Delhi], which he sold before moving to Dadri,\u201d Mavee says. \u201cNow, I have sold land in Dadri and have moved further away. I wonder where we are headed next.\u201d     Women head to work in the assembly unit of a factory in Pithampur. Photograph: Raksha Kumar    Pithampur: desolate factories For the multi-million dollar freight railway line to make economic sense, the Indian government needs much more than just the industries in and around Dadri to be successful. It must connect industrial zones further south, such as Pithampur. This two-decade-old industrial region, some 900km directly south of Dadri, is my next stop along the corridor. Pithampur is the size of Liverpool, but few people live here; there are no schools and hardly any medical centres. Instead, Pithampur \u2013 in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh \u2013 is divided into four special economic zones (SEZs). These are commercially driven \u201cislands\u201d within the country, boasting special economic regulations designed to attract foreign investment in specific industries.  Pithampur sits next to the city of Indore, almost as if it couldn\u2019t care less about the thriving metropolis of 1.5 million people on its doorstep. Pithampur has a schedule all its own: every morning around 8am, herds of factory workers in dark blue suits walk with heads bowed, packed lunches in their hands. Their gait is fast and purposeful. Women dressed in sarees hurry to the assembling and packaging units. As the workers enter the factories, Pithampur\u2019s roads go calm again.     Pithampur\u2019s Sector III, where most small industries have shut up shop    Around 2pm, there is another flurry of activity as the work-shift changes. A different herd of workers enters as the first group departs. The process is repeated again when the factories close, at 8pm. Many of India\u2019s vehicle manufacturing units are located in Pithampur\u2019s sectors I and II; these areas are buzzing at most times of the day. Sector III, however, was meant for small-scale industries \u2013 and a drive around this area reveals the corpse-like plight of small-scale manufacturing in India. I am greeted by the sight of desolate factories standing on weed-infested lands. The roads, water and electricity \u2013 pre-requisites for a functioning industry \u2013 all seem to exist. Labour is plentiful in the neighbouring villages. So why would these industries have shut up shop in bulk? I am told that the problems of infrastructure are so acute in certain areas that raw materials don\u2019t reach the industries here on time. There is also not enough water to sustain all this industrialisation \u2013 so some smaller industries have found it more profitable to close down. Pithampur\u2019s Sector III looks like a symbol of failed manufacturing hubs across India \u2013 so why is the government ploughing money into a gargantuan industrial project such as the DMIC, rather than concentrating its efforts on existing, struggling industrial areas such as Pithampur? \u201cI think DMIC is a giant sandcastle, a mirage that we are being shown so land prices can be racked up,\u201d says Babu Singh Patel, 66, a farmer in Kallibillod village, which adjoins Pithampur. \u201cWhen Pithampur is a failed dream, how can we believe they will build dozens more Pithampurs? We think the DMIC will never happen.\u201d     I think DMIC is a giant sandcastle, a mirage that we are being shown just so land prices can be racked up  Babu Singh Patel        Babu Singh Patel and fellow Pithampur farmers have applied to the High Court to block the government\u2019s plans. Photograph: Raksha Kumar    Patel waves his hands at large tracts of green land behind him, to show me the size of his current plot. If the government has its way, these lands will be acquired for the corridor too. However, Patel and his fellow farmers have filed a case in the High Court to block the government.  We talk under a banyan tree that has watched over six generations of the Patel family. His youngest granddaughter now plays around the fat tree which grows its roots upside down. Patel is confident he will not give up his serenity for the madness that the corridor promises to bring: \u201cEven if DMIC succeeds in setting up industrial hubs that thrive, we do not want to become robotic labourers who carry their lunchboxes to work every day. We eat hot, freshly cooked food for lunch,\u201d he says with a smile. It\u2019s not altogether clear how the government\u2019s proposals for the corridor differentiate it from existing manufacturing hubs such as Pithampur. Some who have worked on the plan feel the major difference is its size: the scale and connectivity of the DMIC is unprecedented, and they believe it will make all the difference for previously disconnected industrial areas. \u201cIf all the industrial areas are connected and have better infrastructure, the percentage of failed industries would be less,\u201d says Manish Agarwal of PricewaterHouse Coopers in Mumbai. Tallen Kumar says another major objective of the project is to tackle India\u2019s unemployment levels. In total, the manufacturing hubs along the corridor are predicted to bring employment for about 25 million people \u2013 yet this figure seems ambitious, given the rate at which industries are mechanising.  Over the past decade, the number of people employed in Pithampur has gone down at a rate of 10% per annum. \u201cRight in front of our eyes, machines began to replace men,\u201d Patel says.     Grazing land for thousands of cattle around the village of Dholera has been notified for industrial use. Photograph: Raksha Kumar    Dholera: tired of dreaming Travelling west from Pithampur, I enter Gujarat, a state that will eventually house more than 40% of the corridor. The DMIC was conceived when prime minister Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat. According to local politicians here, it was always Modi\u2019s favourite project. Roughly 120km south of Gujarat\u2019s largest city, Ahmedabad, a vast expanse of black soil hugs the Arabian Sea. On it rests the small village of Dholera \u2013 a cluster of houses with thatched roofs, muddy roads, and acres of flat, fertile land surrounding them. This region is tired of dreaming \u2013 and tired of its dreams being shattered. In March 2009, the Gujarat government announced it was planning to create an industrial region of about 820 sq km \u2013 larger than Shanghai \u2013 around Dholera. Uprooting around 90,000 people in the process, this industrial region promised to compensate the farmers half in cash, and half by returning 50% of the developed lands to them in due course. Even as the farmers protested this plan, the land was forcefully acquired. Then, when the DMIC gained steam in 2011, the proposal to erect a separate industrial region was abandoned. Instead, it was announced that the land would now be developed into a large airport and a \u201csmart city\u201d, both part of the fabled new corridor.     Hanubhai Jadav, one of the 56 protesting farmers in Dholera    The idea of developing a smart city in Dholera that is capable of accommodating the population of New Delhi seems far-fetched, given it is almost equidistant from four other thriving urban centres \u2013 Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara and Bhavnagar. \u201cWho will come to live here?\u201d asks Sagar Rabari, a local activist. \u201cThe four cities that surround Dholera will not suddenly empty out. The plan seems flawed, fundamentally.\u201d Aparichit Shah (name changed), 23, lives in Bhavnagar, a city that boasts the world\u2019s largest ship-breaking yard. The inheritor of millions of rupees in property and trade, Shah \u2013 who will only speak to the Guardian on the condition that he is not named \u2013 laughs when he explains how he added significantly to his family corpus by speculating on land in Dholera. The Shahs bought 15 acres of land here in 2009, when the government first revealed it was setting up an industrial region. A year later, demand for that land had increased as expectations for the area grew. They sold five acres for a handsome profit of 2m rupees (\u00a319,500). \u201cIt was in 2010 that the rumours began of an international airport being constructed in Dholera,\u201d Shah says. The following year, when the DMIC was announced in Dholera, the Shahs sold a further five acres of land, making three times the amount they had invested just two years earlier. The Shahs have close links to local politicians, who alert them of impending infrastructure plans.  The farmers\u2019 protests in Gujarat kicked off in 2012, ending with a huge victory over the government in 2013. This drove speculators away again, affecting the land prices in Dholera region significantly. \u201cThose who bought land in 2011 are now stuck with it,\u201d says Shah. \u201cLand prices have dropped ever since.\u201d Close to 20,000 farmers are opposing the plans for the Dholera industrial region and smart city. Hanubhai Jadav, 62, was one of the 56 farmers who surrounded the authorities when they arrived in large open-air jeeps to talk to the residents about land acquisition. \u201cWe told them we do not want their compensation,\u201d Jadav says. \u201cWe want our land, and we want to eat what we till.\u201d About a hundred yards behind his mud house is a plot of land the size of a small children\u2019s play area. Jadav grows papaya, bamboo, sugarcane, egg plant, tomatoes and curry leaves there: \u201cWe are at least self-sufficient now. If this land is taken away, what will we eat?\u201d Farmers in about four villages in the region feel they have been taken for a ride. The authorities have changed their minds on what infrastructure project should come up in Dholera at least three times in the past six years \u2013 from the industrial area to an airport to a smart city. \u201cI think they have made up their minds it could be anything but agriculture,\u201d Jadav concludes.

Photograph: Raksha Kumar    Mangaon: fertile protests  The corridor is due to end at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, 200km south of India\u2019s commercial capital, Mumbai. Driving south-east from the megacity\u2019s centre to the suburb of Panvel, skyscrapers make way for silky flyovers and smoother roads. You could break your neck trying to look up at all the giant residential apartment buildings along the way. Then, as suddenly as a change of theatre backdrop, the landscape transforms after Panvel. Green-covered hills and rain-soaked rice fields announce the advent of the Konkan region, the green coastal belt of south-western India. Now a winding, single-lane road leads all of the trucks, state transport buses, cars and occasional motorbikes through the village of Mangaon. The Jawaharlal Nehru port is about 70km from here; every inch of farmland in Mangaon has been notified by the government, and will be acquired for the corridor in due course. Several farmers in Mangaon are university educated; they say their proximity to the major urban centres of Mumbai and Pune ensured that they received a quality education. They are also familiar with the urban way of life:  \u201cIt is too fast and too stressful,\u201d says 60-year-old Abhay Narayan Rao, who looks after 25 acres of land while his sons work in multinational corporations in Mumbai. \u201cDoesn\u2019t our desire to stay on in the village and pursue agriculture mean anything?\u201d asks Rao. \u201cWhy are our fertile farm lands being taken away?\u201d Rao\u2019s older son wants to return to the village and involve himself in agriculture \u2013 which is not such a surprise here. Several young professionals who studied and worked in larger cities have returned to Mangaon for a more peaceful way of life.    Why would we give this up and move to a place that would fetch us less, and suck more out of us?  Abhay Narayan Rao        Farmers still till the land manually in the village of Mangaon. Photograph: Raksha Kumar    According to the central government, more than 45% of the Indian population relies on agriculture, which contributes only 12% of the nation\u2019s GDP. The industrial corridors are an attempt to shift that imbalance \u2013 but predictably, the farmers here are unimpressed. \u201cThe answer to a non-performing agricultural sector is not over-emphasis on industry, but to support agriculture itself,\u201d says Sagar Rabbari, head of a farmers\u2019 association in Gujarat. Rabbari says there are smaller changes one can make to strengthen agriculture, instead of investing billions of dollars on industrial corridors. For instance, Mangaon grows a slew of vegetables and fruits along with the main crop, rice. But the single-lane road connecting this village to Mumbai makes the travel time a tedious five hours. Instead of acquiring all the farmland in this village, the farmers are demanding the road be expanded into a four-lane highway. \u201cIf our produce can reach Mumbai in 2.5 hours, the demand for our crops will quadruple,\u201d says Rao. Mumbai is a large urban market where the demand for organic produce is very high. \u201cWe do not believe that urbanisation is inevitable,\u201d says Rao. He loves to live in his 200-year-old ancestral home, which has 37 rooms and a large step-well right behind it. Sitting on his stony porch, Rao asserts that he is not being romantic about the benefits of agriculture: \u201cHere we earn more than 120,000 rupees [\u00a31,170] a year, and our cost of living is one-fifth that of a city\u2019s. Why would we give this up and move to a place that would fetch us less, and suck more out of us?\u201d   Related: Why India should reject China's obsession with bigger, denser megacities     The DMIC is not only the pioneer, but also an experimental ground for at least four more industrial corridors that are proposed across India. The government says it wants as many as 18 such corridors to criss-cross the country in the future. Masterplans for the eastern and southern corridors have already been approved \u2013 but given the red flags being raised by people who reside between Delhi and Mumbai , it seems unlikely they will follow seamlessly. With sweat dripping down his tanned forehead, Hanubhai Jadav of Dholera stands in front of a small temple in his village and tells me that, if he could get the local politician to back off from acquiring his prized piece of land, he can do it with anyone. Jadav\u2019s determined face betrays no doubt: \u201cWe shall overcome,\u201d he adds with a smile. The same, stifling July heat does not reach the swanky air-conditioned rooms where the advocates and executors of India\u2019s new industrial corridors are based. \u201cWe are confident the government will find a way to acquire land for this project,\u201d says Tallen Kumar, of the DMIC Development Corporation. His face looks as confident as Jadav\u2019s \u2013 but the quaver in his voice might just have betrayed some deeply harboured doubts. Raksha Kumar tweets @Raksha_Kumar.

A gigacity?  While China just keeps building bigger and higher, India has also supersized its old colonial cities, following the centripetal model of dense cores and endless peripheries. White collar workers in Delhi or Mumbai, just as in Beijing or Shanghai, are pushed out to new dormitory towns, hours away from their jobs. A part of the Indian working class may have managed to remain close to their place of work, but at the price of being squeezed into insecure, under-serviced settlements.  Millennium prophecies about the irrelevance of cities \u2013 thanks to new transport and communication technologies \u2013 have been buried along with countless urban utopias. Cities seem to be more central to the global economy than ever. For China and India, urbanisation and development have become quasi-synonymous. In 2012, China\u2019s real estate and construction industry accounted for 15% of the country\u2019s GDP. In India, Mumbai\u2019s represents about 20% of the country\u2019s GDP, and 60% of it is produced in urban areas.   Yet, as far as country-wide urbanisation is concerned, India appears to be lagging behind. The urban population of both countries was 26% in 1990. While this ratio changed only marginally in India, it doubled in China. The UN predicts that it will take at least another 35 years for India\u2019s urban population to reach China\u2019s present 54% mark. By which time, the global giant will be respectably urbanised with three-quarters of its population living in cities and towns.  India seems desperate to catch up with China when it comes to urbanisation. The government plans to create 100 or so \u201csmart cities\u201d, wired to the world and connected to each other via new airports and high-speed trains. New York\u2019s Bloomberg Philanthropies, among others, are advising the government on what being \u201csmart\u201d is all about when it comes to city planning.  But is urban growth really comparable between India and China? And can the shift from rural to urban be expressed only in terms of residential statistics?  One of the main differences between the two countries is the way they deal with internal migration. China has official restrictions on its workforce. It tries (and fails) to maintain its district boundaries through sharp control of movement. In contrast, India\u2019s working classes and service providers move from city to city, village to village, rural to urban areas with astounding fluidity and frequency.    The urban population of China and India was 26% in 1990. The ratio has changed slightly in India: it's doubled in China       Passengers on a train in New Delhi, India. Photograph: Raj K Raj/Hindustan Times/Getty     The unacknowledged armature of pan-India\u2019s urbanity is its run-down railway network, which carries 9 billion passengers per year \u2013 four times as much as China\u2019s state of the art network does. This difference is partly explained by the price: the cheapest train ticket from Shanghai to Beijing (1,318 km in 12 hours) is about \u00a333; from Mumbai to Delhi (1,442 km in about 18 hours), it is just above \u00a33.  Contrary to the common belief that people are simply moving from rural to urban areas, another scenario is playing out in India. Trains and buses going back to the hinterland are just as crowded as those going towards the big cities. There is massive multi-directional traffic of people moving perennially up and down the country. This movement is part of a deferred commuting pattern in which the village and the city are both active spaces in people\u2019s personal and professional lives.   It is typical for an urban worker in India to return home twice or three times a year \u2013 for family functions or to help with the farm during monsoons. Urban families with strong roots in villages have also diversified their sources of revenue and reinvested money there. Millions of small projects are taking place in India\u2019s villages as people build new homes, develop local infrastructure and invest in new technologies for farming and small-scale manufacturing.   With connectivity and infrastructure catching up, villages are turning into more than safety nets for rural-urban migrants. They are becoming parts of large urban systems, where many Indians project their future \u2013 even if that future is made of journeys back and forth.  It is true that migrants to cities have contributed to India\u2019s urban growth. It is equally true that they have maintained ties with their native village homes. Family structures have adapted to manage long-distance relationships. Thanks to mobile technologies, running dual households is easier than ever before \u2013 and partly explains the enthusiastic absorption of this technology; indeed, 650 million Indians are slated to be smart phone owners in four years from now.     Much of India is technologically well-connected: 650 million Indians are slated to be smart phone owners by 2019. Photograph: Petr Svarc/Alamy     Smart phones allow urban Indians to remain in touch with their rural homes, facilitate economic transactions and contribute to the diffusion of urban lifestyles all over the country. It is not just the settled middle-classes that are wired and mobile. The vast majority of workers and service providers, who sell ware on the streets and live in shanties, are also part of this process. A large, though unaccounted, share of the 24% urban dwellers who live in slum areas have kept active ties with their ancestral villages.   India\u2019s brand of \u201ccirculatory urbanism\u201d differs from the standard 20th century model of dominating cities and an endless periphery. Its networked habitats and lifestyles are not quite suburban or simplistically rural either, since dual households remain economically productive and socially relevant on both ends of the spectrum. The same person shifts worker status, slipping from farmer to driver, shopkeeper to manufacturer, hopping between activities and habitats \u2013 and confusing census data.   This is not to say that cities have become irrelevant. On the contrary, they remain key nodes in ever expanding regional and global networks. At some level, cities have always played that role. Mumbai grew as a colonial trading hub, where resources taken from the hinterlands where shipped to the rest of the world. What is new is the level of connectivity between rural and urban zones, generated by people\u2019s free movement and communication. These movements, which ultimately question classic notions of the urban and the rural, are an essential component of India\u2019s urbanity. This means that urbanisation can\u2019t be reduced to a milestone on a demographic chart.   In fact, it would make better sense for policies to forsake the arcane rural and urban lines of directing investment and recognise that India\u2019s urbanity lies on the points of connections between these abstractions. India is more networked than we care to acknowledge. A shift in perspective will help evolve a set of categories and projects that do greater justice to the emerging urban landscape in India.     It is time we start conceiving of the urban as a realm that stretches far beyond the discrete unit of the city       A Chinese farmer on her land, which sits next to a new housing development just outside of Beijing. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images     At present, census data tells us that the fastest urbanisation is happening in smaller towns and cities all across the sub-continent, which are yoked through active channels of mobility to large metropolitan hubs. However, these small and mid-size towns are not just growing in terms of population, but are active nodes that sit on various criss-crossing channels \u2013 linking villages and towns.  Such towns have harnessed the increase in movement brought by advances in transport and communication over the last decades. Urban planners in India need to work with their flows and circulatory systems. For example, recognising the needs of a mobile population, and encouraging the production of affordable rental accommodation in cities in a more targeted way of reducing slums compared to most policies in practice today.   Factoring in how the to-and-fro movements of labour shape urban and rural landscapes through families that work as dispersed but connected units will go a long way in planning more appropriate infrastructure for the real needs of people everywhere.   In the long run, if we are at all serious about addressing environmental concerns and balancing different modern economic sectors \u2013 including the agrarian \u2013 in a labour-surplus economy, then remapping the interconnections between the rural and the urban will make it easier to achieve those objectives.    Related: Delhi Mumbai Corridor: how the world's largest infrastructure project is uprooting Indian farmers     It is time we start conceiving of the urban as a realm that stretches far beyond the discrete unit of the city \u2013 smart or otherwise. Most present policies will only create small enclaves of medieval style fort-cities, surrounded by vast expenses of undervalued habitats.   Instead of playing the catch-up game with China, and exhausting itself on the stationary treadmill of urban development, India should probably recognise the potential of its own brand of user-generated urbanism. Rather than high-speed, it may need to invest more in keeping trains and roads accessible to ordinary residents in villages and towns, as well as big cities.   It is time to get over an outdated image of cities as prime markers of urbanisation and progress in pure demographic terms. India may well be urbanising in ways that are potentially far more sustainable and contemporary than those it is trying to emulate.

He was given a drip and waited it out for a few hours.\u201d Stone-Banks is sure that the cause of the collapse was fake alcohol, the black market supplying it having exploded in China in the past decade alongside the expansion of the bar industry there. Fake alcohol is generally either illegally made, unregulated drink \u2013 think bathtubs and grubby tubes \u2013 or, more commonly, cheap but legally produced alcohol placed in higher-end bottles and passed off as the brand on the label.     A bulldozer prepares to crush thousands of bottles of counterfeit alcohol during a public awareness campaign against counterfeit products in Shanghai, China. Photograph: STR/AP    No one knows how much of the legitimate alcohol industry in China is eaten into by such fakery, but industry figures suggest it\u2019s significant. Brown-Forman, the company that makes Jack Daniel\u2019s, estimates that around 30% of all alcohol in China is fake. Health risks   Related: Spilling the beans on China's booming coffee culture    In its Global Status Report 2014, the World Health Organisation reported that per capita alcohol consumption in China increased from 6.7 litres in 2010 to 8.8 litres in 2012, a 31% rise in two years. If Brown-Forman\u2019s figures are correct, even a conservative estimate suggests that on average every Chinese adult is knocking back a couple of litres of fake alcohol a year. \u201cDrinking fake alcohol is dangerous \u2013 you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019re consuming,\u201d says Dr Bernhard Schwartl\u00e4nder, the WHO\u2019s representative in China. \u201cWhere counterfeit alcohol is made from poor quality ingredients or toxic industrial chemicals, consuming it could lead to serious acute illness or worse in the short term, and potentially a host of medium- and longer-term health problems.\u201d The chemicals Schwartl\u00e4nder refers to include ethylene glycol, which is antifreeze, methanol, which can cause blindness, and isopropyl alcohol: all commonly found in Chinese fake alcohol, all dangerous. The nasty bathtub booze is most likely to contain these, but the more common scam of filling high-end bottles with cheap alcohol can cause more harm than a headache and the feeling of being short-changed.    The whisky is undrinkable. \u200bIt\u2019s not even whisky, it\u2019s some kind of vodka mixed with flavouring and colouring  Bill Isler     In south-east China\u2019s Guangdong province last year, for example, police busted a gang that had been refilling top-brand whisky bottles with 30 yuan-a-bottle (\u00a33), locally made liquor. Conditions were perilously unsanitary, with police reporting bottling taking place in toilets. That bust followed a crackdown in 2012 and 2013, with police reporting many successful raids and tens of thousands of confiscated bottles. Such reports have since become rare but, despite the issue becoming a lower priority for Chinese authorities after their previous flurry of arrests, many in the alcohol industry believe that the problem is as bad in 2015 as it has ever been. A tough one to tackle One of them is Bill Isler, an American who has been running Beijing bars with a \u201cno fake booze\u201d policy since 2005. He says that even reputable distributors have fake alcohol on their price lists. \u201cI know bars that serve \u00a31-a-bottle vodka in Smirnoff bottles,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s worse outside Beijing. In karaoke bars I\u2019ve been to, the whisky is undrinkable. It\u2019s not even whisky, it\u2019s some kind of vodka mixed with flavouring and colouring.\u201d   Related: China's middle class turns to organics after food safety scares    Most spirits in China are drunk with mixers and, although interest in them among the middle classes is rising, most imported brands are relatively new on the scene and it\u2019s easy for shoddy knockoffs to be passed off as the real thing. The rule can apply to champagne too, with one Shanghai nightclub manager telling me last year: \u201cThese may be people who have suddenly come into money, they\u2019re drinking Dom Perignon \u2013 they have no idea what it is.\u201d To stay ahead of the game, many fake alcohol producers are becoming savvy to the emergence of high-end bars in cities such as cocktail mecca Shanghai. \u201cEven some of the most reputable bartenders in China can\u2019t recognise the more realistic knock-offs,\u201d says Daniel Taytslin, managing director of Gotham East, a company that imports specialist alcohol to the country.  Tax rates on alcohol imports to China are high. Booze bottles brought into the country are supposed to carry import stamps that serve to protect legitimate importers\u2019 goods from being replaced by counterfeiters, as well as to prove their legality, but many criminals are one step ahead. Taytslin said that counterfeiters were getting very good at removing unique identifiers that brands place on their bottles. Spirit companies such as Bacardi work with Chinese bars to promote refined drinking that is at odds with fake alcohol consumption, bringing in guest bartenders and holding cocktail competitions. But ground-level battling is usually left to those running the bars. David Schroeder, a former US policeman who runs Shanghai\u2019s popular Senator Saloon bar, has taken to smashing his empty liqueur bottles after he discovered suspected fake booze dealers attempting to buy them from his staff. Despite these barriers, Taytslin is hopeful that Chinese society will become less tolerant of fake alcohol as it gets accustomed to more imports. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get better eventually because the younger generation here is becoming more interested in their drinks,\u201d he says, \u201cjust like this generation is complaining more about pollution.\u201d This awareness may take more time to hit the cheaper establishments of Beijing. Back inside the Sanlitun bar, Stone-Banks eyes up a bottle of whisky labeled as Jim Beam. In a nearby cocktail bar it costs 60 Yuan a shot, here it\u2019s 95 Yuan a bottle. He orders a beer instead.

The store, on the first floor of the Bainaohui mall in Xujiahui, Shanghai, once sold mobile phones and electrical goods. Now it is definitely closed. The stripped shelves are enclosed by yellow tape, and a sign tells potential shoppers that the rent hasn\u2019t been paid.  \u201cBusiness has gone downhill over the past year,\u201d Zhao sighs. \u201cEveryone buys things online these days, and there is just too much competition.\u201d  The six-storey mall was once a go-to electronics destination, packed with traders jostling for business. But over the past decade, the success of internet giants in China has heralded a much tougher market for retailers such as Zhao. The mall is plagued with empty stores, stacked boxes and abandoned cables.  Shopping malls are still a relatively new phenomenon in China. Spending was encouraged as the population grew richer, but the rush to buy meant demand quickly outstripped supply. In 2008, China had about 416 stores per million people; the US had 3,620 per million. As the shopping mall sector began to develop, the popularity of shopping as a pastime for newly urbanised citizens grew, even coining a new phrase, guang jie, which loosely translates as \u201cwindow shopping\u201d. In the past decade, retail space in Chinese cities has expanded almost fivefold. But with the country\u2019s economy sluggish, sales growth has begun to slow and shoppers have begun to temper their spend. Retailers have shifted focus from expansion to rationalisation. Some, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, will actively close stores; when Topshop made its entrance into China last year, it was via online-only store Shangpin.    Retail space has expanded fivefold in the past decade \u2013 but with the economy sluggish, sales growth is slowing       Bainaohui mall in Shanghai used to be a go-to electronics destination. Photograph: Helen Roxburgh     In the past 12 months, 44% of the world\u2019s new shopping malls were built in China, according to commercial property agency CBRE. But with retailers renting less space, some malls are already struggling. In the Zhongguancun area of Beijing, \u201cChina\u2019s Silicon Valley\u201d, the towering e-World mall closed its doors in February, reportedly to be turned into offices. Two malls nearby had already closed temporarily while the owners considered what to do to boost trade.  And yet the building continues. Some estimates predict another 7,000 new shopping malls will open in China by 2025. The top five most active cities in the world for retail development \u2013 all in China \u2013 each plan more than 20 new shopping malls. Amid such staggering supply, both new and old malls face huge challenges attracting retailers and shoppers.  But this is only one side of a complex market. Even with swathes of shopping malls teetering on the brink of collapse, entrepreneurial companies are drawing up blueprints for malls of the future: smart, connected complexes, where stores offer dynamic discounts, tills are redundant and real-time mapping traces your movements.  Retailers the world over have struggled to head off challenges from the internet. But in China, the retail market developed in parallel with e-commerce, and the threat looks very different. Enter the smart mall.   \u201cOne fundamental driving force that gives China an advantage in the development of \u2018smart\u2019 malls is that the fathers of the shopping mall business in China are alive now,\u201d says Melanie Alshab, managing director of Kensington Asset Management. \u201cThey are the entrepreneurs, the visionaries \u2013 and they exist in the same time as all the things that are happening digitally. It\u2019s a completely different mindset; there\u2019s no block between the bricks and the clicks. It\u2019s all just shopping.\u201d    There\u2019s no block between the bricks and the clicks. It\u2019s all just shopping  Melanie Alshab        A new Wanda Plaza in Tongzhou, Beijing. Photograph: Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images     China\u2019s smartphone users skipped the PC era, and many use their devices to go shopping: in 2014, total mobile payments in the country reached $965bn.\u201cIn the US, e-commerce is just online shopping. In China, e-commerce is a lifestyle,\u201d explains Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce site Alibaba. But how can online shopping revitalise physical malls? \u201cChinese consumers are more open to incorporating mobile technology into their physical shopping,\u201d says Janne Haverinen, of technology group Indoor Atlas. \u201cMost Chinese consumers experience online services for the first time through smartphones and mobile apps. This make O2O [online to offline] commerce, where technology is used to drive customers to physical shops, a trillion dollar opportunity.\u201d   In north Beijing, at the headquarters of search giant Baidu, thousands are focused on this opportunity. The office, a sprawling campus dotted with ping-pong tables, a gym and a central lake, is home to one of China\u2019s largest digital pioneers. The youthful company (the average employee age is 26) has moved aggressively into O2O, exploiting its vast mapping and search capabilities. Its web-based app, Baidu Connect, connects users to their physical location digitally, while it\u2019s Groupon-like service, Baidu Nuomi, pushes you digital promotions for offline locations. This means finding your precise place inside China\u2019s immense malls, giving retailers new ways to connect to customers, queuing virtually for restaurants, booking cinema tickets \u2013 all through a phone.     \u2018Online to offline commerce, where technology drives customers to physical shops, is a trillion dollar opportunity.\u2019 Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images     Currently, digital services are being rolled out across 200 malls in China, giving Baidu access to precise data about the habits of the 80 million shoppers who visit daily. In the digital future, the holder of data is king.  As it builds its O2O offering, Baidu is partnering with China\u2019s traditional property groups. The technology giant announced a tie-in with real estate developer China Vanke in 2014, to work together on 20 new digitally smart malls.      \u201cIn the future, you will go shopping without having to take your wallet,\u201d predicts Daniel Suen, head of business development at Baidu. \u201cThe mall will immediately recognise you when you arrive, through your phone. You won\u2019t have to wait for anything, you won\u2019t have to stop and pay for parking, there will be targeted discounts for those stores you like. It will be very convenient, very personalised. This is not an either/or situation; the online aspect makes the offline experience much easier.\u201d Successful malls in China have already begun to evolve, knowing most visitors go to eat, be entertained and go shopping \u2013 in that order. Many complexes have dedicated around half their space to restaurants, cinemas, skating rinks, bowling alleys, spas, playgrounds and even language schools. Many urban communities in China lack adequate public facilities, and malls have become natural meeting places, or destinations for a family day out \u2013 because of this, they will always offer elements e-commerce simply can\u2019t deliver. To cater to the need to be entertained, malls are becoming increasingly specialised. The K11 \u201cart malls\u201d in Hong Kong and Shanghai host exhibitions and events; the popular Claude Monet exhibition attracted 350,000 visitors, who then stayed on to eat or shop. Mall sales increased by a fifth during the exhibition. \u201cBad malls really can\u2019t compete now,\u201d says Alshab. \u201cThe standard is being raised so much higher.\u201d    Many urban communities lack adequate facilities, and malls have become meeting places and destinations for families       The K11 art mall in Shanghai, China. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images     Inevitably, some businesses will boom with O2O where others are far more vulnerable. Back at the Bainaohui mall, Chen Huibin, Zhao\u2019s neighbouring retailer, also saw his business slipping last year. So Chen launched his own website, plus social media accounts where customers can look at his stock, discuss or reserve online, then come in and collect items.  \u201cCustomers still like to see electrical goods before they pay,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to see it, feel it and check it\u2019s not fake \u2013 many people still don\u2019t trust that what they buy online will be good quality.\u201d  China\u2019s retail market is definitely not a place for the risk-averse. At his closed store, Zhao finishes his tea and muses future plans for his business. A new Weibo account, he considers, a different business partner, a website and a new store location. His business isn\u2019t dead; it\u2019s just in a constant stage of evolution.

The unstoppable rise of female comic readers", "article": "About 10 years ago there was a TV advert for men\u2019s the deodorant Lynx that, in its own particular laddish fashion, presented a procession of beautiful \u201cideal women\u201d who could be persuaded to display counterintuitive attitudes when confronted by a man liberally doused in a cloud of the brand\u2019s macho, musky scent. Thus we had a montage of women really not minding about being kept waiting in the rain, being completely forgiving about missed birthdays, appreciating the fact that their breasts had been scrutinised, and one who announced, with unalloyed delight: \u201cThat is SO funny! I collect comic books too!\u201d The implication was clear: like falling asleep after sex, comic books are supposedly a wholly male preserve. Fast forward a decade, and how times have changed \u2013 at least in terms of comics. So much so that, for one glorious moment this month, female comic readers tipped the balance and outnumbered males \u2013 or so it seems. Graphic Policy is a website that has run since 2008, initially looking at comics at the more political end of the spectrum and morphing over the years to encompass statistics and demographics about comic readers and sales. Each month they publish a report that breaks down comic readers into gender, age, ethnicity etc, using a fairly complicated \u2013 and admittedly not very scientific or comprehensive \u2013 formula that takes as its baseline all the people in the US who list comics as a hobby or \u201clike\u201d on their Facebook pages. Perhaps not an exhaustive survey, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that, as the author of the report points out, the US Facebook \u201cpopulation\u201d is pegged at some 36 million people \u2013 so it\u2019s a fairly weighty control group from which to make an assessment.     Gail Simone poses with fans at the Shanghai Comic-Con. Photograph: Alamy    And in the demographic report presented on 1 September, for the first time the gender split was in favour of women: 53% of Facebook users who \u201cliked\u201d comics, graphic novels and various other iterations of the term used for the statistics were female. It was a brief moment, however, and was probably down to a Facebook glitch rather than a sudden swing. According to the report\u2019s author, and Graphic Policy founder, Brett Schenker: \u201cOn 11 September the data was checked again, and the stats have returned to where I\u2019d expect. There are 42m likes for the terms, with men accounting for 23m (54.76%) and women for 18m (42.86%). We can chalk up the below to a glitch with Facebook reporting at the time of data gathering.\u201d But still the statistics make for interesting reading, and even at almost 43%, the modern comic readership gender split is a far cry from Lynx\u2019s stereotype of 2005. Much of the growth in female comic readers can be put down to the fact that there are far more women working in comics these days \u2013 Gail Simone, Kelly Sue DeConnick, G Willow Wilson, Tula Lotay, Ming Doyle, to name a handful. And comic books from Marvel and DC featuring women characters are proliferating \u2013 for instance, the all-female Avengers A-Force, Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel, Harley Quinn, Batgirl, Catwoman, Spider-Woman and the forthcoming Patsy Walker, AKA Hellcat. There is also the rise of digital comics, which can be bought from home without having to step foot across the threshold of the local comic shop. While the Android\u2019s Dungeon stereotype of the foreboding comic shop from The Simpsons might well be dying out, there\u2019s possibly still a perception that some comic shops are a male-dominated territory, coupled with the clinging dregs of the \u201cfake geek girl\u201d row of a couple of years ago, when it was posited that some women only pretend to like comics and nerd-culture to impress men. Which is pretty much where we came in, and which is an equally outmoded bag of nonsense.

Suzanne Wolffe had returned to work part-time as a French teacher while she was in remission from acute myeloid leukaemia. Born in Morocco, she was multilingual, had taught herself Mandarin and was very active, walking six miles daily.  In May, at an out-patient clinic at the Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham, she fell and fractured her wrist and hip. She was admitted overnight and had surgery the following day to repair the damage. Doctors decided on a partial hip replacement, involving cementing a femoral implant into the socket. She had a sudden drop in blood pressure followed by cardiac arrest and attempts by anaesthetic staff to resuscitate her in theatre failed. Her husband, Michael Wolffe, an optometrist, had been at an international meeting in Shanghai but had spoken to her every day. \u201cShe said how well she felt. Every day she said it had probably been one of her best weeks and she felt really, really good,\u201d he told the Birmingham coroner at his wife\u2019s inquest. He heard about the fall and arrived at the airport expecting to go straight to the hospital to see her, but was met by one of his sons, David, who told him she had died during the operation. Emma Brown, the Birmingham and Solihull coroner, ruled that Wolffe\u2019s death was accidental, caused by bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS). The court heard that this was a rare but known risk in hip fracture operations where cement is used, which is the norm in the UK although not in all countries.  Only a minority of patients, including the very frail, who may not withstand the longer time in surgery, and those with heart conditions, are given implants that are not cemented. But there have been increasing concerns over cardiac arrests and deaths during hip repair surgery using cement. In 2009, the National Patient Safety Agency issued an alert to the NHS because of the number of reports it had received from hospitals of death or severe harm to patients. Last year, the former chief medical officer and later head of the NPSA, Sir Liam Donaldson, was one of the authors of a report, published in the BMJ Open medical journal, which attempted to estimate how much damage was being done. They found that between 2005 and 2012 there were 62 reports from hospitals of severe harm and 41 of the patients had died. However, the death toll could be considerably higher. An audit done by senior anaesthetists suggested there could be 75 deaths a year from BCIS, although they said there could be other factors besides the cement affecting mortality. In a letter to BMJ Open, in support of the Donaldson paper, they point out that a recent Norwegian study found the same level of risk. Wolffe\u2019s orthopaedic surgeon, Deepa Bose, told the coroner her team had opted for cement in line with guidance from Nice, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. \u201cThe outcome is better,\u201d she said, adding that patients had much better function afterwards. \u201cWe follow the Nice guidelines unless there is a reason not to follow them.\u201d  What happened to Wolffe was \u201ca known complication although very rare\u201d, Bose said. \u201cAccording to the national figures, the drop in blood pressure occurs in approximately 20% of patients but cardiac arrest occurs only in 1%.\u201d Anaesthetists accept that the benefits of cement outweigh the risks. \u201cEssentially there is a better outcome with cemented,\u201d said Iain Moppett from Nottingham University, a professor who was one of the authors of the letter to BMJ Open.  Many patients with fractured hips are elderly and frail. Those who have cemented implants suffer less pain, so can potentially move about and lead a better quality of life more quickly, Moppett said. \u201cIn my opinion, you should still cement someone but you should be very aware that it still carries a risk.\u201d Some hospitals have responded to the danger. Coventry has now pioneered what it calls the \u201ccement curfew\u201d, which ensures everybody working in an operating theatre is aware of the cardiac arrest danger and prepared to deal with it should it occur. Bose told the coroner that she and her team were fully prepared for the risk. But Wolffe\u2019s family cannot understand why cement is still the default option for orthopaedic surgeons in the UK. It was still not understood why BCIS happened, they have pointed out. It is thought that some of the cement or possibly fat or air gets into the arteries and forms a clot, but nobody knows for sure. In other countries, cement is used far less. \u201cThere are enough people undergoing this procedure that it will kill dozens, if not hundreds, of people. They don\u2019t know why it happens,\u201d said Richard Wolffe, son of Suzanne and Michael, a journalist formerly with the Financial Times and now living in the US and working as a commentator for the TV network MSNBC.

Back in Beijing, propaganda officials bill Obama\u2019s guest as an omnipotent man of the people who loves football, dumplings and, above all, China. But nearly three years after Xi came to power most observers are still struggling to understand the enigmatic ruler of the world\u2019s second largest economy: a man some call China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao, yet others see as the captain of a rapidly sinking ship. Some who have encountered Xi describe him as an affable, inquisitive man with a penchant for watching Hollywood movies including Saving Private Ryan. \u201cHe is very charming,\u201d said one western diplomat who has met Big Daddy Xi. Others paint a portrait of a ruthless and calculating strongman who has more in common with Russian president Vladimir Putin than Tom Hanks. \u201cHe is feared more than he is admired,\u201d said Willy Lam, the author of a book called Chinese Politics in the Era of Xi Jinping: Renaissance, Reform, or Retrogression? Orville Schell, a veteran China watcher who has been following Chinese politics since the Mao era, is among those grappling with the mystery that is Xi Dada. Schell had a front row seat to observe China\u2019s then vice-president when Xi travelled to the US to meet Joe Biden in 2012. \u201cHis face reminded me of the Mona Lisa: a kind of a flicker of an expression but it never breaks into anything telling, as if he were really, consciously trying to withhold his reactions,\u201d he remembered. \u201cIt is incredible.\u201d Schell said he believed the Communist party leader had modelled himself on Han Feizi, a philosopher known as China\u2019s Machiavelli whose basic maxim was: \u201cKeep it mysterious \u2013 don\u2019t be transparent.\u201d \u201cI think Xi Jinping\u2019s whole fundament of statecraft is to keep his cards very close to his chest, keep everybody a little bit uncertain and off balance and to project thereby an air of greater authority,\u201d Schell said.      Xi Jinping as a young man in the countryside. Photograph: Farmers Daily China    \u201cDostoyevsky wrote in The Grand Inquisitor about ruling with magic, mystery and the sword. I think there\u2019s something of that.\u201d Mao Zedong was another key influence. \u201cMao too was very guarded. He rarely came out into public. He didn\u2019t mix with the people. He ruled from behind the veil. And he always kept people off balance by no one ever quite knowing what he would do next. I think there is a bit of that in Xi Jinping.\u201d Xi, now 62, was born four years after Mao\u2019s Red Army swept to power following years of civil war. His childhood and teenage years coincided with some of the most tumultuous years of modern Chinese history, as the Cultural Revolution followed the devastating Great Famine, in which tens of millions died. Raised inside a cocoon of Beijing privilege, Xi was initially insulated from such horrors but not the political intrigues that have long defined China\u2019s Communist party. Aged just nine, he saw his father, a revolutionary leader called Xi Zhongxun, purged after falling foul of Chairman Mao. During the decade-long Cultural Revolution, a teenage Xi was sent to rural Shaanxi province where he lived in a cave, shovelled pig manure, caught fleas and studied the works of Marx and Mao. Those chaotic early years instilled in Xi a ferocious determination to succeed, those who have met him say. \u201cA revolution like China\u2019s gets deep into the bloodstream of a country and I think it got deep into the bloodstream of Xi Jinping because all of his formative experiences were up in Shaanxi, in the Maoist era,\u201d said Schell. Many of Xi\u2019s peers sought to overcome the traumas of the Cultural Revolution by hurling themselves into \u201cromantic relationships, drink, movies and Western literature\u201d, a university professor who knew him told US diplomats, according to Wikileaks cables. Not Xi. \u201c[He] chose to survive by becoming redder than the red.\u201d While his contemporaries were having fun, Xi was \u201creading Marx and laying the foundation for a career in politics\u201d.     Xi Jinping and Barack Obama at the Annenberg retreat in California, 2013. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP    The US embassy source described Xi as a man \u201crepulsed by the all-encompassing commercialisation of Chinese society, with its attendant nouveau riche, official corruption, loss of values, dignity, and self-respect, and such \u2018moral evils\u2019 as drugs and prostitution\u201d. As Communist party chief, Xi \u201cwould likely aggressively attempt to address these evils\u201d, the source suggested. Such predictions have largely come true since Xi Dada, which is also translated as Uncle or Papa Xi, became China\u2019s top dog in November 2012.  Under Xi some of the party\u2019s most powerful figures have been humiliated and jailed as part of a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has seen hundreds of thousands of party officials disciplined across the country. Prominent victims include Zhou Yongkang, the feared former security tsar; Ling Jihua, once an influential aide to president Hu Jintao; and People\u2019s Liberation Army titans such as Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, who died earlier this year. \u201cI think he is trying a Cultural Revolution but a Cultural Revolution without the unpredictable violence of the early Red Guard years,\u201d said Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University professor and the author of Mao\u2019s Last Revolution. \u201cMao tried to have the Cultural Revolution in order to try and make his people more revolutionary \u2026 and Xi Jinping is trying to make his Communist party more honest, and that is certainly a Cultural Revolution after the tremendous destruction of the ideals of the 40s and 50s.\u201d MacFarquhar said Xi\u2019s determination to eradicate corruption stemmed from his conviction that it threatened the very existence of the party, which was founded in Shanghai in 1921. \u201c[But] purifying the party doesn\u2019t just mean getting rid of corruption. The main thing that Mao taught him \u2013 that Mao taught them all \u2013 is what goes on in people\u2019s minds.\u201d In his fight to conquer those, Xi is waging both propaganda and ideological wars designed to boost his own standing and to squeeze the life out of any opposing idea or group. Potentially subversive \u201cwestern ideas\u201d and liberal academics have been targeted in Chinese universities and schools with the education minister warning that enemy forces were attempting to use the classroom to topple the Communist party. Meanwhile, spin doctors have set about building a cult of personality around their leader with books, cartoons, pop songs and even dance routines celebrating Xi Dada\u2019s rule.   Related: Chinese military parade's main message is not peace but power    Earlier this month, thousands of troops goose-stepped through Tiananmen Square as part of a massive military parade proclaiming Xi\u2019s unassailable position at the party\u2019s helm. \u201cThere is this aristocratic flair which has now become more apparent, particularly after the military parade,\u201d said Lam. \u201cThe word demi-god would be an exaggeration but after the military parade he looked like an emperor.\u201d Many ordinary Chinese appear enamoured with their 21st century emperor. \u201cHe has the backing of the whole country,\u201d claimed Zhang Jingchuan, the songwriter from Sichuan province, describing his leader as an approachable man of ideas. Human rights activists, liberals and dissidents \u2013 some of whom will gather in the United States this week to protest the Chinese president\u2019s visit \u2013 have been less impressed. Since Xi came to power, there has been a concerted effort to obliterate civil society in China, with moderate and once-tolerated critics including human rights lawyers, feminists, religious leaders and social activists harassed or thrown in prison. More than 200 lawyers have been detained or interrogated as part of a sweeping crackdown on their trade that began in July. At least 20 remain in detention or are missing, prompting calls for Barack Obama to cancel Xi\u2019s visit to the US. \u201cWe had hoped for something different,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe are surprised by just how bad it is.\u201d MacFarquhar blamed the dramatic tightening on Xi\u2019s obsession with the collapse of the Soviet Union, which followed Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s attempts at reform. \u201cWhen he first came in he exhibited how much the Gorbachev phenomenon had spooked him. He is very conscious of long-term threats \u2013 and maybe he doesn\u2019t see it as long-term. If he is only thinking in terms of 10 years, now is the time to solidify the country and he thinks he knows how to do it.\u201d Yet for all Xi\u2019s apparent muscle \u2013 one academic has dubbed him the Chairman of Everything \u2013 not everyone is convinced by the growing legend of Xi Dada.    Related: Obama warns of 'weaponising the internet' ahead of Xi Jinping's US visit    \u201cI never bought the powerful leader narrative at all. But now it\u2019s publicly displayed to be a fiction,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, a respected observer of the Chinese economy and politics, who believes the recent stock market debacle and deadly Tianjin explosions exposed a president far weaker than many had thought. Lam said that while Xi painted himself as a man of the people he was now revealing himself to be an aloof leader increasingly reliant on a close circle of \u201ccronies and aides\u201d. \u201cThe problem with Xi Jinping is that he is not a policy person. He has demonstrated a weakness for offering solutions, for example, in the most important area \u2013 the economy.\u201d David Shambaugh, a renowned China scholar from George Washington University, has controversially suggested that, as the Communist party enters its \u201cendgame\u201d, Xi faces the threat of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.  But he disagreed that Xi\u2019s standing had been affected by China\u2019s chaotic summer. \u201cXi seems pretty unruffled by the events of recent months. He is a leader with extreme confidence \u2013 perhaps too much so.\u201d     Xi inspects troops. Photograph: Zhang Jun/Xinhua Press/Corbis    Shambaugh argued that China now needed a strong ruler to cope with the \u201cmultiple and serious problems\u201d it faced. \u201cBut his attempt to concentrate power in himself is not necessarily the best way to address the problems. I do think that Xi sees the depth of difficulties that the Communist party faces, but whether his actions are improving the party\u2019s longevity or shortening it is a debatable question.\u201d Certainly his actions have done nothing for US-China relations, which have soured dramatically under Xi Jinping with clashes over issues ranging from cyber-hacking and a crackdown on Christianity to alleged currency manipulation, the building of artificial islands in the South China Sea and Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia. \u201cI think [people in Washington] are beginning to become quite alarmed at their inability to \u201cdo a Joe Biden\u201d on [Xi] and say: \u2018Let\u2019s just get together, you and I, and solve some of these little problems,\u2019\u201d said Schell. \u201cI think Hillary [Clinton] tried. I think Obama\u2019s tried. I think Biden\u2019s tried. But [China has] been very resistant to that idea of just signing up for a big joint effort. They say it in words but they don\u2019t demonstrate it in body language and fact. The common ground has shrunk.\u201d   Related: Xi Jinping\u2019s China is the greatest political experiment on Earth | Timothy Garton Ash    The reign of China\u2019s inscrutable Xi Dada may have poisoned relations with the US but his promises to vanquish the corrupt and catapult his nation towards what he calls the China dream have played well at home.\u201cXi\u2019s promise is to restore China to greatness and respect in the world and this is a very meaningful thing for many Chinese,\u201d said Schell.  Zhang Jingchuan, whose song Everybody praises Xi Dada has been viewed more than 830,000 times online, is one of millions now throwing their weight behind the president\u2019s drive towards the \u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d.  \u201cI feel that I can relate to the warmth and the great expectations that the public have for Xi \u2013 [the belief] that he will lead the country to a better future and towards national rejuvenation,\u201d the composer said. \u201cThat is why I wrote this song.\u201d On the eve of Xi\u2019s trip to the US, a former Chinese propaganda official reportedly paid $100,000 for a full-page advert in the New York Times promoting a book that promises \u201ca preview of what we might expect from China in the Xi Jinping era\u201d. Few observers dare to make specific predictions about where Xi\u2019s China is heading but as he enters his fourth year in office there are growing concerns about what that era might bring. \u201cA fragile system \u2013 like a sandcastle \u2013 can last for a long time [but] there has to be some big wave that knocks it over,\u201d MacFarquhar said of the Communist party Xi Jinping now leads. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a crossroads so much as going down a rather treacherous road and not knowing what perils are around the corner.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["Xi Jinping", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Communism"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-19T10:00:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/19/george-osborne-britain-should-bond-china-now", "sentences": ["And a new Silk Road for international trade, made up of roads, high-speed railway lines, bridges and airport hubs, stretches from Shanghai and Beijing through Xinjiang to Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Afghanistan before making its way to western Europe and to Britain."], "title": "It\u2019s in Britain\u2019s interest to bond with China now | George Osborne", "article": "Take yourself forward, for a moment, and imagine it is the year 2030.

And a new Silk Road for international trade, made up of roads, high-speed railway lines, bridges and airport hubs, stretches from Shanghai and Beijing through Xinjiang to Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Afghanistan before making its way to western Europe and to Britain. This isn\u2019t a fantasy. It is the 2030 that most economic forecasters now predict. Over the last 15 years, China has surpassed the UK, France, Germany and Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest market. Its growth has been phenomenal. Even now, it is creating an economy the size of Australia every two years. There are those who say we should fear China\u2019s rise \u2013 that we should somehow guard ourselves against it. But we reject such thinking, which would simply leave the UK slipping behind. Instead, we should embrace it. We want a golden relationship with China that will help foster a golden decade for this country. It is an opportunity that the UK can\u2019t afford to miss. Simply put, we want to make the UK China\u2019s best partner in the west.   Related: George Osborne: We should embrace China, not fear its rise    So over the next five days we will be travelling around China promoting the best of British culture, showcasing the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d and offering its firms and authorities support from our world-leading financial services industry. We will be travelling not just with leading British business leaders but the leaders of our great museums and theatres. We want to promote understanding between our two great cultures, which have arguably done more to shape the world than any other. We won\u2019t just be travelling to China\u2019s great cities, but also to inner China, to areas where no UK ministers have been before. It\u2019s these regions of \u201cnew China\u201d that will help power its growth in the decades ahead. As China\u2019s global influence grows, so too must our relationship. But as we integrate further, of course we do so aware of the inevitable risks: risks that have come to a head in the last few months with turmoil in Asian financial markets that spread around the world. In the UK, we saw the FTSE fall by 4.7%, and in the US the S&amp;P fell by 3.6%. But recent volatility will not put us off. It should drive us forward so that we integrate China\u2019s new financial markets with our own so they are deeper and better able to absorb shocks. Then it should serve as a reminder to get our house in order so that we can deal with global difficulties. We need to continue working through our long-term economic plan, which will mean that we run the biggest economic surplus for decades and begin bringing down our national debt. Our economy is already growing faster than any other major advanced economy, our deficit has more than halved, and employment is near record highs. But if we are to sustain this in the longer term we must continue integrating with the world\u2019s fastest growing regions. That has been a plan we have followed over the last five years, attracting more Chinese investment to the UK than Germany, France and Italy combined, with our exports up 73%. Even as China\u2019s growth slows, it will continue to be a powerhouse for the global economy. As China pushes ahead with its own reform programme, with increased consumption and a demand for services, there will be many new opportunities for the UK. Opportunities for UK manufacturing, infrastructure, retail and financial services. There will also be opportunities to attract new firms to the UK, such as Huawei, which opened its global R&amp;D centre here last year. This government will ensure that the benefits of our stronger relationship with China are not just felt by those in London. That is why the business delegation is not only composed of leaders from London, but businesses from the north of England, from Wales, and from the south-west will also be represented. It is also why we will be taking civic leaders such as Sir Richard Leese, head of Manchester city council, to meet their Chinese counterparts. We hope our dialogue with China\u2019s leaders will pave the way for a successful Chinese state visit next month \u2013 the first for a decade \u2013 when the Queen and prime minister will welcome President Xi to the UK. We are at a critical moment in our relationship with China. We need to double our efforts to strengthen our economic links, help British firms enter the market there, and attract more investment into the UK and the northern powerhouse.

More people know of him as a fearless scourge of the Chinese government than have ever seen a single one of his works. So the very least achievement of the Royal Academy (which has had to watch in horror as Ai managed to get a visa to travel from China only to fall foul of our own asinine immigration service) is to set forth an enormous array of his sculptures, installations and films for the first time before a British public. Ai\u2019s gift is for the humanisation of conceptual art. Marcel Duchamp was his god as a student in New York in the 1980s \u2013 a coat hanger bent into the shape of Duchamp\u2019s profile, the hook forming a question mark, is a deft homage \u2013 and the ready-made remains his regular medium. Bicycles, humdrum symbols of Chinese daily life, are suspended in silver clusters to make a soaring chandelier. Qing dynasty tables, reconfigured by master craftsmen, become martial arts fighters: two legs planted on the floor and two against the wall as if straining against the pressure of tradition.     \u2018Invokes the people of the past in a beautiful new form\u2019: Ai Weiwei\u2019s Grapes, 2010, a cluster of Qing stools, at the Royal Academy. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex Shutterstock    A cluster of Qing stools, strung together and spiralling upwards like a sputnik or diadem, invokes the people of the past in a beautiful new form. Each work has its deep local meaning but each is an emblematic gathering of souls, of human communities as opposed to communism.    The story of Ai\u2019s own struggle runs through this show from first to last    Ai remakes the ready-made, but also the destroyed. The cycling artist is the great recycler. Ancient carved-wood fragments are massed into a kind of catafalque for the dead (though with discreet handles for a gymnast to swing upon, a typically upbeat addition). What is compacted in this massive block is not just Chinese wood but Chinese culture: the curlicues of demolished temples, the fragments of old houses, old furniture, the elements of people\u2019s lives \u2013 and their livelihoods. One of the most dramatic works here is a bricked-up temple \u2013 or so it appears. Chunks of wall jammed into a carved-wood facade are not in fact ancient but poignantly modern: the remnants of Ai\u2019s studio near Shanghai, demolished by the Chinese government before it was even completed on specious planning charges in 2011. The story of Ai\u2019s own struggle runs through this show from first to last, with films about the demolition, his house arrest and the crab dinner he threw to mark the destruction, which was attended by a thousand guests (though not by the artist, again detained by police). A heap of porcelain crabs silting up one corner of the Royal Academy \u2013 a lone hero crab climbing free of the rest \u2013 marks the occasion once more. As Sean Scully remarks in the catalogue, Ai is modestly immodest.     \u2018Brilliant and frightening\u2019: one of the cells in Ai\u2019s work S.A.C.R.E.D., in which six dioramas contain half-lifesize effigies of himself and his guards in scenes from his incarceration. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images    The activism and the art are one, Ai has said; and almost all the art in this show speaks to the conditions of Chinese life. Over the years, Ai has employed a vast team of compatriots to expand this point. Who can forget the tide of sunflower seeds stretching across the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern in their millions, each handmade in porcelain and each unique, every worker made to count. The opening room of this show is hung with radiant silver rings \u2013 14 of them, large and shining, reprising the lunettes of the Royal Academy\u2019s architecture but with an ultramodern industrial look that transports you to the mass-production factory far away where they were made. This is Ai at his subtlest, his speech both global and local. For although they look like mysterious planets, these rings, in their build-up of internal rims, describe the topography of China. This show is variable. Ai has part-ownership of a marble quarry and has for several years employed masons to recreate contemporary objects in stone. Marble handcuffs, marble lipsticks, marble pushchair: the transformations go two ways. Some things are elevated while others turn absurd, such as the surveillance camera constantly trained on Ai\u2019s home rendered sightless and impotent in marble. But Ai repeats the trope so often that its weaknesses are readily exposed. There is a lot of renovated pop here \u2013 Chinese vases dipped in high-chrome paint, Coca-Cola crassly inscribed on a 2,000-year-old bowl (raising the obvious question of whether the artefact would now be more or less valuable). Presumably this must have special significance to Chinese viewers, but it feels otherwise commonplace. Over at Tate Modern, in their new show The World Goes Pop, dozens of artists in Mexico to Japan were doing something nearly identical back in the 60s. Coke, Hoover, Nissan, nuclear warheads, the cold war, the objectification of women \u2013 the targets were consistent, the techniques of collage, screen-printing, soft sculptures and shrill photo-based painting universal. The curators have even found Ukrainian examples in what amounts to a research project in three very banal dimensions. Pop, as if we didn\u2019t know it, became a convenient megaphone for propaganda. One vitrine in Ai\u2019s show contains the bones of an intellectual who died in one of Mao\u2019s labour camps \u2013 or rather, the bones cast in bronze and painted in exact facsimile. The commemoration lies in that (invisible) transformation. It must at least be acknowledged that the act of honouring the dead is as important as the art itself \u2013 perhaps more so. The deed is what counts. In some respects, what\u2019s on show at the Royal Academy are the relics of a lifetime\u2019s performance art.     Straight: \u2018a solemn and poignant commemoration\u2019. Photograph: Ray Tang/Rex Shutterstock    It is no surprise that the strongest works here are the largest \u2013 Ai is at his best on a grand scale \u2013 and the most searingly political. The potency of Straight, his commemoration of the 5,000 children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that shattered their jerry-built schools, lies mainly in his devotional act of straightening by hand 90 tonnes of twisted metal collected from the ruins of the schools. Tides of rusting bars form a welling landscape on the floor, somewhere between gently undulating hills and a landslide. It is a solemn and poignant commemoration, as if one could roll back time. Though what really mattered to the people of Sichuan was the way Ai used his world-famous blog to try and name both the victims and the officials involved in the deadly construction that brought these schools to instant collapse. Ai\u2019s blog was shut down (though many entries have been published in a book) and he was later illegally incarcerated for 81 days. Six rusting tanks in the final gallery give us something of this experience. Peer through a grille and what you see in each is a diorama of the cell, half life-sized, featuring Ai and two guards in effigy. Silent and watchful, the guards march him up and down the cramped space, stand over him as he eats and sleeps, scrutinise him in the shower (one squinting critically at his manhood), menacing him with intimate surveillance. It is a brilliant and frightening work, his confinement evoked in the claustrophobic reduction that allows you to become both a witness and a spy, embarrassed and appalled. And it is the essence of Ai\u2019s activism: a work that simultaneously documents an act of state brutality in a spirit of defiant freedom, a work that unleashes the political power of art. \u2022 Ai Weiwei runs at the Royal Academy until 13 December; The World Goes Pop is at Tate Modern until 24 January 2016", "tags": ["Ai Weiwei", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-20T07:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/20/chinese-cuisine-andrew-wong-", "sentences": ["\u201cIn much of the country, we use the exact same word for \u2018meat\u2019 as we use for \u2018pork\u2019.\u201d In the Islamic west, however, \u201cmeat\u201d more often than not means lamb or goat, and the spicing and techniques applied to it are as different from what you\u2019ll find in, say, downtown Shanghai as a Cornish pasty is from a haggis."], "title": "'People think Chinese cuisine is less refined: that's just not true'", "article": "Been to your local Chinese this week, for a takeaway to eat in front of the telly or even a posh sit-down? If you have, chances are the menu you chose from was Cantonese, with, if you\u2019re very lucky, the odd Sichuan dish by way of welcome variation. It\u2019s just the way things are; and much as they\u2019ve been ever since the British developed a taste for chicken and sweetcorn soup and chow mein way back in the 1950s. Unless, that is, your local happens to be A Wong in Pimlico, central London. This place is pan-Chinese in a way you\u2019re unlikely to have encountered before. \u201cTo say \u2018I\u2019m a Chinese chef\u2019 is as meaningless as saying \u2018I\u2019m a European chef,\u2019\u201d explains 33-year-old chef/owner Andrew Wong. \u201cQuite apart from all the regional differences across such a vast country, China has 14 international borders, and they all have an enormous impact on what\u2019s eaten locally.\u201d Western China, for instance, is predominantly Muslim, he says, so pork, which is more or less synonymous with British Chinese food culture (wot no char siu?), is off the menu altogether. \u201cThe idea of not eating pork is an alien concept in the rest of China, too,\u201d Wong says. \u201cIn much of the country, we use the exact same word for \u2018meat\u2019 as we use for \u2018pork\u2019.\u201d In the Islamic west, however, \u201cmeat\u201d more often than not means lamb or goat, and the spicing and techniques applied to it are as different from what you\u2019ll find in, say, downtown Shanghai as a Cornish pasty is from a haggis. Wong\u2019s career started at Westminster Kingsway catering college, where he learned the ropes of classic French cooking, before working at various European restaurants around the capital, though in truth he was born into the Chinese restaurant trade. Quite literally so: in 1985, his parents opened Kym\u2019s, a Cantonese institution on the same site he runs now, so while his schoolmates would go home to packets of Skips and frozen burgers, young Wong grew up on prawn crackers and beef in black bean sauce. \u201cPeople think of Chinese food as somehow less refined than western cuisine,\u201d he says, \u201cbut that\u2019s not true: it\u2019s just refined in a different way.\u201d When Wong took over the family business, before reopening the restaurant in its current guise in 2012, he was determined to use his new menu to showcase his country\u2019s cuisine as a whole \u2013 or as much as is possible in a 45-seater restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame Anglo-Chinese restaurants specialise in Cantonese food,\u201d he says. \u201cDiners are missing out on all kinds of cooking cultures.\u201d So, alongside the instantly familiar crispy duck, A Wong\u2019s menu features the likes of hand-pulled noodles from Lanzhou in the north-west, Hong Kong custard tarts, some of the best dim sum you\u2019ll find this side of the Yangtze, and Yunnanese stir-fries from the south that, to British sensibilities at least, seem more Vietnamese in style than anything you\u2019d ever expect to find in China. The menu is testament to Wong\u2019s magpie tendencies, developed from frequent stints travelling and working all around China, \u201cand writing down ideas and recipes on hundreds of scraps of paper. If nothing else, the book [see right for extract] means I finally have them all in one place.\u201d That\u2019s not to say this is all cheffy, complicated and time-consuming fare. Far from it. Take Wong\u2019s version of classic spare ribs. Sure, it involves steaming the ribs for two hours first, to get them to just the right consistency, but it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re actually doing anything while that\u2019s going on; to finish them off, the cooked ribs are added to a sweet-sour sauce that takes mere minutes. Even so, Wong says: \u201cThere\u2019s no way you could replicate the heat of the woks used in a professional kitchen. We\u2019ve got these turbo-charged burners that get so hot, we can do a stir-fry from start to finish in 30 seconds, whereas at home it might take three or four minutes to achieve a similar result.\u201d Mind you, while the likes of Peking duck and char siu roast pork may, on the surface, appear pretty simple dishes, they are, he insists, \u201cthe hardest to perfect. Centuries of development and technique have gone into making them what they are today. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so iconic.\u201d But if they\u2019re so hard to get right, why include the recipes in the book? \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve invested so much time and effort into researching and developing them, the duck in particular, that I just wanted to get them all down on record somewhere. And anyway, there are bound to be plenty of home cooks who fancy giving them a go for themselves.\u201d", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Chinese food and drink", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-20T08:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/20/osborne-china-visit-beijing-best-partner", "sentences": ["We want to make sure that the British-China relationship is second-to-none.\u201d Osborne\u2019s trip, which will include stops in Shanghai, Chengdu and the western region of Xinjiang, is the latest sign of Downing Street\u2019s drive to repair ties with China after Beijing froze top-level diplomatic relations following David Cameron\u2019s meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2012."], "title": "Osborne kicks off China visit vowing to be Beijing's best friend", "article": "George Osborne has started a five-day tour of China by vowing to make Britain Beijing\u2019s \u201cbest partner in the west\u201d despite accusations that the Tory government is cosying up to the Communist party and ignoring a growing human rights crisis and the fight for democracy in Hong Kong. \u201cWhere some people are cautious about getting more involved in China, we say quite the reverse.

A series of major Chinese investments in Britain are expected to be unveiled during Xi\u2019s trip, with officials in both countries hailing a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations.   Speaking on Sunday afternoon at Beijing\u2019s Tech Temple, a former factory converted into a headquarters for Chinese startups, Osborne again called for a \u201cgolden decade\u201d of relations. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for Britain and China, and I think if we set out on this goal of making Britain China\u2019s best partner in the west then we reap the benefits for both our economies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no country in the west that is as open to Chinese investment as the United Kingdom. We welcome Chinese investment. There is huge amounts of Chinese investment coming into Britain at the moment. Indeed, we are attracting more investment than Germany, France and Italy put together.\u201d The British government\u2019s growing warmth towards Beijing has angered activists who claim London has turned its back on commitments to human rights and democracy in Hong Kong in order to avoid jeopardising economic ties.  \u201cIt reminds me of 2,000 years ago [when] Judas got 30 pieces of silver,\u201d said Martin Lee, one of Hong Kong\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy campaigners. \u201cMoney buys their silence on Hong Kong.\u201d Hu Jia, an outspoken Beijing activist, said it was \u201cvery regrettable\u201d that Osborne failed to publicly raise concerns over a severe political crackdown that is unfolding in China. More than 200 Chinese human rights lawyers and activists have been disappeared, jailed or interrogated as part of an \u201cunprecedented\u201d government crackdown that began in July. \u201cWhen does the west plan to stop making concessions on human rights?\u201d Hu asked. \u201cI know sometimes foreign leaders and diplomats would rather communicate their concerns in private rather than make them public, but this is exactly what the regime wants. It only encourages the regime to be more blatant in its crackdown on human rights.\u201d Lee said: \u201cThe Chinese government is very smart \u2013 much smarter than the British. The Chinese government makes the British government think that if they behave properly by keeping quiet on these sensitive issues then they get more business. And the British government, of course, takes that line.\u201d Osborne did not address such concerns during Sunday\u2019s brief appearance where foreign reporters were allowed to ask only one question by the host from Chinese state-controlled television.  The British embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. During a speech at Peking University last month, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, insisted Britain continued to raise concerns over human rights with Beijing. \u201cOur relationship [with China] has become sufficiently mature that we can be candid with each other in our private discussions about those areas on which we do not see eye to eye, including human rights.\u201d Osborne said there was \u201chuge excitement\u201d about the opportunities for British businesses in China, even as its economy slowed. \u201cPart of my job here \u2026 is to help to explain to British people what\u2019s going on in China and how exciting it is,\u201d he said. Hu Jia called on Osborne to explain the Communist party\u2019s crackdown on human rights to British people rather than giving them the \u201cpropaganda version of China\u201d.  Lee said he had given up hope of Downing Street speaking up for democracy activists in the former British colony. \u201cBy refusing to support Hong Kong\u2019s development for democracy, the British government hopes to do more business with China. I think it is a shame. I don\u2019t think they will ever be vocal again,\u201d he said. \u201cYears ago, before handover, some British friends of mine told me I shouldn\u2019t put my hopes in the British government at all about our future.

Last month\u2019s stock market meltdown and disappointing economic data from China have fuelled concerns that the world\u2019s second largest economy is slowing faster than its government is letting on. However, speaking on Sunday the chancellor insisted that even with its economy slowing, China would continue to be \u201ca massive source of growth going forward\u201d.   Related: It\u2019s in Britain\u2019s interest to bond with China now | George Osborne    \u201cChina is undergoing a very important economic transformation - a transformation that its government wants to see [and] that its people want to see - from that investment-led economy of the past to a consumption-led economy of the future. And of course when that happens you are going to find that challenging. It is a big change,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cBut put it in perspective. The Chinese economy is forecast to grow over the next five years in such a way that it will add to the world economy an economy the size of the United Kingdom at least. So the growth in the Chinese economy will be more than the entire British economy at least in the coming five years.\u201d Speaking on the first day of a five-day tour of China, Osborne sent a message to his Communist party hosts, who are grappling with how to manage their country\u2019s economic transition while avoiding a hard landing. \u201cWhen you look at what China is doing at the moment, I think that the message that I would say to China is: \u2018Carry on with the reform, carry on with the change you are making,\u2019\u201d Osborne said. \u201cIt will be of course challenging - it can\u2019t be anything other than challenging when you\u2019ve got the world\u2019s second largest economy and you\u2019ve got 1.3 billion people who are undergoing this big change \u2026 so you do get things like movements on stock markets.  \u201cBut it is important to keep our eye on the bigger picture as well - on the bigger prize - that this period of economic reform can lay the foundations for Chinese prosperity for decades to come. So we are very support of the economic reforms that the Chinese government has talked about and are now starting to [put into practice].\u201d Chinese authorities face the challenge of reforming the country\u2019s vast economy away from over-dependence on investment and exports and towards more domestic, household consumption. They are also seeking to gradually take the heat out of overvalued property and share prices.Reforms have included moves to rein in debt-fuelled investment, from large infrastructure projects to individuals buying property and speculating on the stock market.  But the International Monetary Fund warned recently that further structural reforms will be needed to make the Chinese economy more open, and it urged China to press on with plans to move to a more market-based financial system, to reform state-owned enterprises and move to an effectively floating exchange rate. Osborne\u2019s trip will see him travel to four Chinese cities, starting with Beijing and then Shanghai, Chengdu and Urumqi in the far north west. On Monday he is due to meet senior Chinese leaders in Beijing while on Tuesday he will visit the Shanghai stock exchange, the epicentre of the summer\u2019s market chaos. \u201cI am going very deliberately to the Shanghai stock exchange and I\u2019m going to talk there specifically about the financial markets and the events of the summer,\u201d Osborne told an audience of high-tech entrepreneurs in Beijing. \u201cOf course there have been ups and downs. But in our estimation, the spillover effects - the impact of that on other financial markets - has been relatively limited.\u201d  Osborne\u2019s trip to China is part of growing efforts to boost ties between London and Beijing following a diplomatic spat that began in 2012 when - to the Communist party\u2019s fury - David Cameron met with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. China imposed a top-level freeze in ministerial contact but relations were subsequently restored and Cameron vowed to build a \u201clasting friendship\u201d with Beijing during a December 2013 visit. Now, officials in both China and Britain are vowing to push for a \u201cgolden decade\u201d of relations. \u201cWe want Britain to be China\u2019s best partner in the west and that is what brings us here today,\u201d Osborne said on Sunday. A series of major Chinese investments in Britain are expected to be unveiled next month when president Xi Jinping travels there next month on his first state visit to the country.    Treasury minister Jim O\u2019Neill, who is travelling with Osborne in China, said the country\u2019s continued slowdown was \u201cvery predictable\u201d and that he remained upbeat about the prospects of what he called the \u201cNew China\u201d. \u201cOf the four \u2018Bric\u2019 countries, so far this decade China is the only that has grown by more than I assumed it would do at the start of the decade,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist who created the bric acronym in 2001.

Webber, took the win for Porsche in the six hour day-night race, half of which was run in darkness, alongside team-mates Brendon Hartley and Timo Bernhard in their No17 919 Hybrid. It is their second in a row after taking the flag at the last round at the Nurburgring. Equally, indicative of the advantage Porsche currently hold, it is the marque\u2019s third successive victory, including a one-two at the Le Mans 24 Hours. Andr\u00e9 Lotterer, Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer and Marcel F\u00e4ssler, who are the current championship leaders for Audi and won here last year, finished in second place, reducing their lead from 17 points to 10, with three rounds remaining at Fuji, Shanghai and Bahrain, but it is almost impossible to see them making up the gap in pace they have to Porsche in those three races. Porsche, however, must run clean, error free and ensure they finish to close and overhaul their rivals. In Texas, as had been the case at the Nurburgring, this was not quite the case. Webber had opened with the perfect start, on the first lap passing the No18 sister car of Marc Lieb, Neel Jani and Romain Dumas, who had qualified on pole. Very quickly Webber and Hartley proved they were enjoying the better running of the two cars and had their set-up for COTA spot on.   Related: Porsche win Le Mans 24 Hours race for the 17th time    By the first round of stops they were almost 12 seconds clear and a further 33sec by the second stop. Indeed Webber and Hartley were matching one another in pace, with at one point both putting in identical fastest laps of 1.47.457. They looked dominant and had still yet to attempt to double-stint their rubber. However an entirely uncharacteristic error from Webber, when he overshot his pit box at the end of the third stint cost the squad time, an error compounded by a one minute stop-go penalty subsequently imposed on the team. It was not for the Webber incident however. A mechanic was adjudged to have touched the car during refuelling at the second stop when Hartley was handing back to the Australian. Forbidden under WEC rules a penalty was unavoidable and it put the No18 Porsche out front and looking hard to catch. But a world championship title might also require a little luck and as at the Nurburgring, where the No18 car looked quickest but was hit with a series of penalties after which the No17 inherited the win, it seems to be going Webber and his team-mates\u2019 way. With just 35 minutes to go the leading Porsche suffered an electrical problem and had to pit and return to the garage, from which it did ultimately emerge to run the final lap of the race and was classified in 12th place. However the major score had been for Webber\u2019s crew, who took the maximum 25 points after 185 laps and who were, even after the penalties, still more than a minute up on the second-placed Audi. The latter now face a very difficult challenge to hang on to their lead, one compounded by the upshot of the problem for the No18 car. They are now 35.5 points behind the leaders and can be expected to be subject to team orders to maximise the points for their sister car should it be necessary to secure the title. A Porsche one-two at Fuji, with Webber\u2019s team at the front and the leading Audi in third, would see the world championship tied with two races to go. The sister Audi of Lucas di Grassi, Oliver Jarvis and Loic Duval took third place, their first podium of the season, after they too had suffered a highly uncharacteristic error when a mechanic dropped a wheel in the pitlane, leading to a one-minute stop-go. Toyota, still well off the pace, lost one of their challengers just after three hours when Mike Conway crashed while trying to lap an Aston Martin, but the sister car of Sebastien Buemi, Anthony Davidson and Kazuki Nakajima, took fourth place, albeit two laps back. Confirming that this year the leading prototype field is clearly divided into three in terms of pace and that Toyota, who are now looking to match Porsche for power next year, they are unlikely to play any part in the coming championship battle. The series, which is enjoying increasing popularity also announced this weekend that next season the calendar would be extended to nine races, with the addition (to be confirmed by the FIA World Motorsport Council) of a race in Mexico.

The chancellor, on a trade mission to the country, argued that Britain should \u201crun towards China\u201d to help boost the UK economy and signalled that China could build a nuclear site in Bradwell, Essex, as part of a wider nuclear co-operation worth tens of billions of pounds. Speaking at a press conference, Osborne sidestepped concerns over Downing Street\u2019s growing proximity to Beijing. When asked about what US officials have called Britain\u2019s \u201cconstant accommodation\u201d of Beijing, Osborne added: \u201cI think it is important that, as China grows, it rightly takes its place at the top table.\u201d  The chancellor also used his visit to announce \u00a36m for cultural exchanges to boost tourism, including sending the British Museum\u2019s blockbuster exhibition A History of the World in 100 Objects to China, plus tours of Mandarin versions of Shakespeare and the first world war drama War Horse.  Osborne is due to visit the Shanghai stock exchange on Tuesday to pledge that Britain will \u201cstick together\u201d with the east Asian power, after a period when the Chinese stock market has been hit by sharp falls.  Aiming to establish the City of London as China\u2019s \u201cbridge\u201d to western financial markets, Osborne is expected to say: \u201cWhatever the headlines, regardless of the challenges, we shouldn\u2019t be running away from China. Through the ups and downs, let\u2019s stick together ... to grow our economies.\u201d However, despite Osborne\u2019s optimism, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday that China could be heading for a rough economic patch. In a speech in London, Carney described China\u2019s economic \u201cmiracle\u201d in the last three decades as extraordinary, but noted that performance since the recession of 2008-09 had \u201cbeen bolstered by a large build-up of debt, which has more than doubled to reach almost 200% of GDP\u201d. Some were now questioning China\u2019s \u201cglide path to global economic hegemony\u201d, the governor said. The Bradwell site is owned by EDF, the French energy company. EDF is also the lead partner with two Chinese companies in the building of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for a generation \u2013 and on Monday Osborne unveiled a \u00a32bn loan guarantee for the plant.     Osborne and Chinese vice-premier Ma Kai in Beijing on Monday. Photograph: Ding Haitao/Xinhua Press/Corbis    The \u00a324.5bn Hinkley project has been much delayed and EDF has struggled to finance it. Industry observers believe that the Chinese agreement to help finance Hinkley is conditional on the UK allowing Chinese companies to construct their own nuclear plant at Bradwell.  \u201cThis civil nuclear cooperation \u2026 opens the door to majority Chinese ownership of a subsequent nuclear project in Bradwell,\u201d said Osborne, according to Reuters. The energy minister, Amber Rudd, accompanying Osborne, said the UK would benefit from low-carbon energy, while China wanted a first showcase in the west for its newly developed nuclear technology. \u201cThey very much want to have their design up and running in the UK,\u201d she told the Financial Times. \u201cThat\u2019s because we have such tough standards of regulation everyone can have confidence they are safe and show that they have a great operation to take elsewhere.\u201d  However, while welcoming the \u00a32bn support for Hinkley, the GMB union, which represents nuclear workers, said linking that deal to a reactor at Bradwell would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of British workers. Brian Strutton, GMB national secretary for energy, said: \u201cChinese nuclear technology is unproven and no UK government should even consider allowing it to be used in a new nuclear power station 60 miles from London.\u201d   In May, a leading Chinese nuclear physicist, He Zuoxiu, told the Guardian that China\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d rapid nuclear expansion was compromising safety. He said: \u201cNuclear energy costs are cheap [in China] because we lower our standards.\u201d The \u00a32bn support for Hinkley was welcomed by Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers: \u201cThis development is welcome news and long overdue. Nuclear is set to play a central and vital role in the UK\u2019s energy future.  \u201cAlthough the financial costs of nuclear power seem high, this power station will provide and modernise the diversification we so badly need in ensuring the UK\u2019s lights stay on. The government now needs to push forward with the development of other nuclear power sites.\u201d   Related: Hinkley Point fails on cost and reliability, but the show must go on    However, experts including analysts and HSBC bank, have been lining up in recent months to condemn the deal. Lord Turnbull, former head of the civil service, told Osborne that the Hinkley deal was a \u201cbottomless pit and a big white elephant\u201d, while the former energy minister Lord Howell, Osborne\u2019s father-in-law, said it was \u201cone of the worst deals ever\u201d for British consumers and industry. In his press conference on Monday, Osborne made no mention of an intensifying human rights crackdown in China, which has seen more than 200 lawyers and activists \u201cdisappeared\u201d, detained or interrogated since July.

The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, had recently suggested interest rates might have to remain low partly due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy.  Osborne said Britain had \u201cthe right people to make the call\u201d adding \u201cthe governor has signalled, I think pretty clearly, the direction interest rates are heading\u201d.  Osborne acknowledged that the Fed had defied expectations and kept interest rates low due to the slowdown in Chinese stocks. He said interest rate setters \u201care always going to be sensitive to what is going on at that moment, but the general signal coming from the Bank and Federal Reserve is, because the economies have been growing robustly in the last couple of years, the exit from very loose monetary policy is going to come\u201d. Speaking before an address at the Shanghai stock exchange, Osborne said he would not become involved in \u201cmegaphone diplomacy\u201d over China\u2019s human rights record. Instead, he insisted the UK needed to embrace the Chinese economy, which he described as \u201ca phenomenal part of the world economy\u201d. Asked if Britain was giving legitimacy to the Chinese government\u2019s abuse of human rights, he said: \u201cChina is an incredibly important partner for us and there are so many tens of thousands of British jobs dependent on our business links with China. \u201cDo we disagree with China about human rights ? Yes we do. Does that mean we resile from our British values? Not at all. But is it not better to engage and talk about these things rather than stand on the sidelines and try and conduct some kind of megaphone diplomacy?\u201d He added: \u201cWe are two completely different political systems and we raise human rights issues, but that is not inconsistent with doing business.\u201d In his speech to the stock exchange, Osborne argued that even with slower immediate growth China would be the single biggest motor of growth across the world. Osborne said the Chinese economy was undergoing a major transformation from an economy sustained by investment to an economy powered by consumption. \u201cThat is what the Chinese leadership call the \u2018new normal\u2019\u201d, Osborne said. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous, tectonic shift. It will be bumpy. It will create challenges. It inevitably means a slower growth rate than the double-digit growth of the last decade. But if China continues to grow as the IMF forecasts, it would mean going from GDP of $11tn this year to a GDP of about $16tn in just five years.\u201d  Osborne also said he would not dignify Michael Ashcroft\u2019s unauthorised biography of David Cameron with a comment, adding that the British people had given a verdict on his premiership in May and that Britain\u2019s success was due to its leadership.  Downing Street\u2019s strategy is to ignore the book but indicate that Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman, had demeaned himself and been blinded by Cameron\u2019s refusal to give him a high-profile ministerial post in 2010 even though he had donated \u00a38m to the party.

There have been repeated outbreaks of inter-ethnic violence in the region, which is home to China\u2019s Muslim Uighur minority, amid a security crackdown with activists accusing authorities of systematic human rights abuses. Osborne\u2019s visit comes one year to the day after a moderate Uighur academic, Ilham Tohti, was jailed for life for separatism on charges activists believe were politically motivated. Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International\u2019s east Asia director and a Xinjiang expert, said the chancellor had an obligation to speak out against alleged human rights abuses by the government in the region, including \u201ctorture, disappearances, a complete denial of religious freedom, freedom of association [and] freedom of expression\u201d.    The UK could show it is on the lookout for economic opportunities but doesn\u2019t sacrifice its principles at the same time  Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International     He said: \u201cThe Chinese government tries hard to project a picture of normalcy in Xinjiang because it serves their purpose in terms of advertising the region as a safe place for economic investment and to push the \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 strategy. [But] of course Xinjiang is probably one of the worst places in China in terms of its human rights record. \u201cWhat would be problematic would be if there was no acknowledgement from the chancellor that this is a region with a particularly striking and severe level of human rights abuses.\u201d Bequelin said that by publicly raising such issues during his visit to Xinjiang \u201cthe UK [government] could show that it is on the lookout for economic cooperation opportunities but doesn\u2019t sacrifice its principles at the same time\u201d. Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s visit to Xinjiang coincides not only with a wave of gross repression in the name of countering terrorism but also with the one-year anniversary of the life sentence handed down to Ilham Tohti, a scholar arguably best positioned to address growing tensions in the region. \u201cDoes George Osborne want to be the best friend of people across China [by speaking out against human rights abuses]... or does he want to be the best friend of the Chinese Communist party which is responsible for those abuses?\u201d  The Guardian repeatedly asked Treasury officials if Osborne would publicly raise Tohti\u2019s case or wider concerns over a growing human rights crackdown in China but received no specific response. In a brief emailed statement, the chancellor said: \u201cWe don\u2019t see a choice between securing growth and investment and raising human rights issues. We do both consistently, and indeed I have done so in meetings here in China.\u201d Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday, Osborne said it was better to engage with China rather than to stand on the sidelines and shout with a megaphone. China rejects accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and has described Tohti \u2013 who some have compared to Nelson Mandela \u2013 as an extremist who preached \u201chatred and killing\u201d. Xinjiang has long been a restive region where Beijing has been accused of human rights abuses and implementing policies that discriminate against Uighurs in favour of a growing wave of Han Chinese migrants.     Ilham Tohti. George Osborne\u2019s visit comes exactly a year after the academic was jailed on separatism charges. Photograph: Andy Wong/AP    One of the most notorious incidents came in 1997 when a deadly riot broke out in a city in west Xinjiang called Yining or Ghulja. In 2009, at least 197 people died when inter-ethnic riots broke out in Urumqi, a city of about 2.5 million inhabitants 1,500 miles west of Beijing. China launched a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d on terrorism in May 2014 after dozens were killed in a bomb attack on a market in Urumqi that Beijing blamed on Islamic extremists. Bequelin said Beijing had legitimate concerns over Islamic terrorism but claimed it was \u201cusing a sledgehammer approach to dissent in the region and very often conflates peaceful dissent with advocacy of terrorism\u201d. The tensions in Xinjiang are immediately apparent in Urumqi, where soldiers carrying riot shields and automatic weapons are stationed outside the airport. The motorway into the city is lined with red and yellow banners reading: \u201cThe party\u2019s great policy is the root of our great life!\u201d and \u201cUnswervingly promote the long-term stability of Xinjiang\u2019s society!\u201d Metal barricades protect the entrances to hotels and shopping centres. Bequelin warned that by travelling to the region without publicly highlighting Xinjiang\u2019s problems Osborne risked becoming part of \u201cthe fictional and manipulative Chinese discourse about what is going on in the region\u201d. He said: \u201cI would be curious to see what exact economic benefits are being touted by this visit which entails a very high potential risk of presenting the UK as being uncritically supportive of Chinese policies in Xinjiang which are incredibly repressive and may lead to further violence and ethnic polarisation in the future.\u201d   Related: Chinese city bans Islamic beards, headwear and clothing on buses    Richardson said a failure by the chancellor to publicly raise human rights issues would show \u201chow craven and cowardly UK policy towards China has become\u201d. She said Osborne was \u201cduty bound\u201d to speak out over Tohti\u2019s detention and to push Beijing for a radical rethinking of its economic, social and religious policies in Xinjiang, where under-18s are banned from worshiping in mosques. \u201cYou can\u2019t show up and do deals with an abusive government without becoming complicit in the abuses yourself,\u201d she said. Liu Xiaoyuan, a lawyer who has represented Tohti, said international pressure was unlikely to secure his release given the bleak political atmosphere in China. \u201cIn the current climate ... his release is virtually impossible.\u201d However, Li Fangping, another of the academic\u2019s lawyers, said global condemnation might improve conditions for Tohti in jail.  Bequelin questioned whether Osborne\u2019s decision to travel to Xinjiang was an attempt to \u201cingratiate\u201d the British government with Beijing. He urged the chancellor not to \u201cwalk blindly and naively into a very complex and tense political situation and just pretend that it doesn\u2019t exist\u201d. He said: \u201cThat seems to have been the whole of Osborne\u2019s approach to China: that hubris and sheer willpower can somehow change reality. He seems to be so determined to ignore any kind of information that doesn\u2019t really sit with this happy story of the UK being such a great partner [of China and] finding economic opportunities that are a win-win for everybody.\u201d It is not clear why Osborne\u2019s delegation chose to visit Urumqi on the one-year anniversary of the jailing of Tohti, who had protested that the Uighurs had been excluded from Xinjiang\u2019s economic boom. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether British or Chinese officials had selected the date. Bequelin speculated the choice could be a Chinese attempt to manipulate Osborne\u2019s \u201cwillingness to do business at any cost and ignore anything that is unpleasant\u201d. He said: \u201cWhat better example of the fact that the west and the UK don\u2019t care at all about human rights than to get the chancellor [to visit Xinjiang] on the very day [Tohti] was unjustly sentenced to life imprisonment for raising issues that are directly related to the economic development of the region?\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["Human rights", "George Osborne", "Xinjiang", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Politics", "UK news", "Foreign policy", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-22T09:45:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2015/sep/22/intercontinental-hotels-could-benefit-from-fairmont-deal-say-analysts", "sentences": ["Fairmont, which as well as the Savoy also owns the Plaza in New York, the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, and Raffles Singapore, is owned by Qatar-based Katara Hospitality and Saudi Arabia-based Kingdom Holdings."], "title": "InterContinental Hotels could benefit from Fairmont deal, say analysts", "article": "InterContinental Hotels is reportedly close to buying Fairmont Raffles, which owns luxury assets such as the Savoy in London, and Morgan Stanley analysts are positive on the idea.

With a possible $1.5bn buyback by InterContinental, a purchase of Fairmont for a reported \u00a31.9bn would make it hard to boost earnings per share in a material way if the share repurchase went ahead. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Jamie Rollo said:  Press reports (Sunday Times) suggest that InterContinental is closing in on a deal to buy Fairmont Raffles for \u00a31.9bn. Sources suggest InterContinental has beaten rivals including Wyndham and Accor, and is likely to seal the deal \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. Neither party has commented, but we note that InterContinental has not put out a statement denying the rumour, as it did after the Starwood takeover rumour (though the company said it was required by the authorities to put out a statement that time).  Fairmont, which as well as the Savoy also owns the Plaza in New York, the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, and Raffles Singapore, is owned by Qatar-based Katara Hospitality and Saudi Arabia-based Kingdom Holdings. It would fit with InterContinental, given the company recently admitted a strategic gap in the luxury market. InterContinental also has funds available.

Morgan Stanley\u2019s Rollo said:  Having performed well both operationally and financially since its 2003 demerger, and with the Hong Kong and Paris hotel disposals completing its move to an asset light model, we think InterContinental management feel they are in a strong position to invest for growth. Unencumbered luxury hotel brands don\u2019t come around that often, and the conundrum InterContinental likely faces is having to justify a multiple potentially double that on which its shares trade, and thus forfeit the more immediate and relatively safer upside from a large share buyback. With its shares on under 11 times 2016 estimated EBITDA and 17 times PE (post our current assumption of a $1.5bn buyback), we think they are good value for a high quality hotel business operating in a cycle where we see further upside, and we rate them overweight.

The policy debates were a fine technical replica of the issues facing a full-scale government, but none of it seemed relevant to the people elsewhere, heading to work on real trains.   Related: Osborne expected to back Chinese nuclear power station in Essex    This problem predates the Lib Dems\u2019 eviction from office. It expresses their historic loss of a monopoly on the idea that should give them political identity. There are plenty of liberals and democrats in Britain, but they are not neatly aligned to one party. Liberalism colonised the centre of British politics in the 20th century by capturing the upper echelons of the big two. In the 1960s, Labour oversaw a social emancipation from the repressive pettiness of class, religious and cultural establishments; in the 1980s, the Conservatives made a dogma of free enterprise. The two strands then cross-fertilised. Tony Blair disavowed his party\u2019s attachment to state control of the economy; David Cameron imposed tolerance of ethnic and sexual diversity on his tribe. Those shifts have provoked symmetrical dissent. Ukip\u2019s growth after 2010 was driven in large part by conservative reaction against a metropolitan elite bias in Cameron\u2019s first phase of \u201cmodernisation\u201d. There was too much cultural continuity from New Labour. The election of Jeremy Corbyn expresses frustration that has brewed for years on the left with New Labour\u2019s economic continuity from Thatcherism. Both phenomena contain a complaint about the consequences of Britain\u2019s embrace of liberal globalisation. Resurgent socialism demands state coercion of markets to level out uneven wealth distribution. A new nationalism demands protection for an imagined indigenous identity with tighter border\u00a0controls. Tim Farron\u2019s misfortune is to lead a party that bears the name of an elite consensus but sees itself as a band of plucky outsiders. Kippers and Corbynites wave pitchforks against the orthodoxy, while Lib Dems knock politely and ask for readmittance. Locked out of their own tradition, they\u00a0look in at the windows and grumble that the place is being trashed by political squatters. Liberalism\u2019s next chapter is being written not by Farron but by George Osborne, thousands of miles from Bournemouth. The chancellor is on a visit to China with the primary purpose of drumming up investment and the auxiliary goal of burnishing his credentials as a prime minister-in-waiting. The trip is a statement of intent to make Britain as eager a participant in 21st-century globalisation as it was in the last century, and the one before that. The emblem of this mission is a prospective deal, lubricated with Treasury guarantees, that would allow Chinese companies, in partnership with French-owned EDF, to build a new generation of nuclear power plants in the UK. There are not many developed countries that would allow a foreign state, let alone China, to take such a significant stake in their strategic infrastructure. But that is Osborne\u2019s point. He is placing a bet on Beijing as a source of global growth, and pushing to the front of the queue. \u201cNo economy in the world is as open to Chinese investment as the UK,\u201d he said on arrival. The chancellor used a speech at Shanghai\u2019s stock exchange to spell out his confidence that a recent market crash there was just passing volatility; no cause for alarm. \u201cWhatever the headlines \u2026 we shouldn\u2019t be running away from China,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the ups and downs, let\u2019s stick together.\u201d     George Osborne delivers a speech at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters    This gamble is born partly of necessity and partly of conviction. Osborne is not a laissez-faire fundamentalist. He has an appetite for intervention, with a particular interest in building things. He may have cultivated a political brand as a fiscal disciplinarian, but he would also like his legacy to include the honour of having refurbished Britain, making it fighting fit for the economic future. The two ambitions collide. Infrastructure costs money but he has made a taboo of public borrowing. Chinese cash is meant to bridge the gap. In exchange he offers Britain\u2019s expertise in finance and high-skilled services. A strategic punt on this scale ought to be the subject of intense political scrutiny. Yet the question of whether authoritarian China will be a trustworthy or morally decent shareholder in UK plc is hardly discussed. Beijing does not plug capital shortfalls in Europe, nor open its markets to imports, out of charity. There is a diplomatic as well as an economic quid pro quo. Osborne slipped a reference to Britain\u2019s status as a democracy into his Shanghai speech, but as a minor cultural difference between friends, to be handled with \u201cmutual respect\u201d. This is liberalism stripped of the cumbersome apparatus of civil rights and political freedom to be more economically streamlined.   Related: Osborne 'must raise human rights abuse' on visit to volatile Chinese region    Osborne is blessed with opposition still struggling to cope with the stage of globalisation where rules were set to a \u201cWashington consensus\u201d. Labour hasn\u2019t begun to get its head around the Beijing-friendly version. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s only apparent beef with the Chinese Communist party is that its embrace of \u201cmarket philosophy\u201d has been bad for workers\u2019 health and safety. The Lib Dems will complain from the sidelines about the environment, civil liberties and constitutional reform, but that is pressure-group stuff. They are in no state to posit a rival governing creed. The New Labour settlement accepted that government could not tame globalisation but might divert some of the proceeds to spend on public services and compensate those left behind with benefits or tax credits to top up wages. The financial crisis exposed the brittleness of that bargain. It revealed the narrowness of the Treasury\u2019s tax base: its reliance on the City, private debt and a housing bubble to simulate rising prosperity. Recession and stagnation then laid bare a deeper cultural alienation from the whole arrangement \u2013 grievances that are as much about national identity, migration and job insecurity as they are about take-home pay. Those problems haven\u2019t gone away, but there is little sign that Osborne is engaged with them. They threaten the consensus that has governed Britain for a generation, of which he is the custodian. Without debate or challenge, the chancellor is steering the country into uncharted waters.

Two-way trade missions with the UK have been increasing steadily, until China\u2019s recent stock market crash threatened to temper some of that momentum. But those at the coalface don\u2019t appear anxious about the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Take specialist brush manufacturer Cottam. Ten years ago it started investigating a cheaper source of supply for its injection mould tools, which led it to China. More recently, it set up an office near Shanghai to demonstrate deeper commitment to the market and take over supplier relations (previously the China-Britain Business Council provided a go-between service). The next step is to start exporting its products, and Cottam is already in talks with potential Chinese distributors.  \u201cOur aim is to grow our business in China,\u201d says managing director Ben Cottam. \u201cThe economic slowdown doesn\u2019t concern us \u2013 yet, anyway. The market cooling down is actually no bad thing as it had been growing so rapidly. And the currency devaluation helps with sourcing, making it cheaper to bring products to the UK. Exports might suffer, but that\u2019s just international business.  \u201cThe bigger picture is the size of the Chinese market and its interest in western products. Even though China is a vast producer of goods, it has a huge appetite for European products because of our high standards for quality and safety, so we see huge potential for sales.\u201d Cottam is not alone. This week, the China-Britain Business Council (CBBC) hosted a China SME Forum in Nottingham \u2013 a national event where 100 UK SME delegates got a chance to meet 100 visiting business and government representatives from the Chinese city of Ningbo. Ian Hambleton, managing director of Output Group and its offshoot Studio Output, was among the speakers at the event. His businesses specialise in communications, branding and video content for the technology sector in China, which is a huge growth area. Hambleton\u2019s clients include Baidu and Tencent. \u201cSince expanding to China in 2012, the tech industry has begun to mature in its branding communications strategy,\u201d he says. \u201cCompanies are starting to understand and appreciate the importance of telling the story of their brand\u2019s cause and vision, rather than just talking about their products and services.\u201d While Hambleton believes the economic slowdown may affect traditional manufacturing in China, he sees nothing but opportunity for his own business, as the government ploughs funds into digital and technological innovation. For VR Aviation Safety Partnership, which provides services for regulatory compliance in aviation and aerospace, there is an opportunity to capitalise on China\u2019s growing appetite for western quality standards. Over the summer it provided two aircraft design certification workshops to Chinese aircraft manufacturer AVIC. Of the market crash, VR\u2019s senior consultant Malcolm McMillan says: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any problems in negotiation or payment, and additional projects are being discussed.\u201d Meanwhile, Sondrel\u2019s business in China is growing at an impressive rate. It provides consulting services to semiconductor companies from two sites in the country \u2013 Xi\u2019an and Shanghai \u2013 after opening its first office there six years ago. Today, two-thirds of its staff are based there and annual growth exceeds 30%. \u201cI continue to be optimistic about China,\u201d says Sondrel CEO Graham Curren. \u201cCommentators seem to focus on the lower GDP percentage growth rate, but if you measure the growth in dollars it is nearly three times the growth of 10 years ago and represents a higher proportion of world GDP growth than ever before, even at the current level of 7%.\u201d Sondrel plans to open a new, larger office in Xi\u2019an later this year. \u201cOur academy continues to be popular as a training ground for new engineers \u2013 all the graduates of this course are going on to well-paid jobs,\u201d Curren says.  New developments in integrated circuit design, especially associated with the internet of things phenomenon, are heavily centred on China, he notes. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to bringing the best of east and west engineers together to produce increasingly exciting products.\u201d So what can UK SMEs take away from these experiences and how can companies determine their own commercial potential in China?  Mark Hedley, a China business adviser at CBBC, confirms that any slowdown at a macroeconomic level isn\u2019t filtering through to the UK businesses he deals with. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any decline in the number of companies coming to us for help and support,\u201d he says.  \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s now more often a case of businesses wanting to take existing activities to the next level. We\u2019re also seeing a steady stream of Chinese companies coming to the UK.\u201d  CBBC has just hosted a seminar for JD.com, China\u2019s second biggest e-commerce platform. \u201cThey came to find UK brands to sell,\u201d Hedley says. \u201cThe consumer market, especially online, continues to grow at a healthy rate. There has always been a prestige factor in China for imported goods.\u201d  Hedley sees export opportunities being particularly strong for those selling premium high street goods targeted at the growing middle class and products whose safety standards matter \u2013 from baby products, food and drink, and pharmaceuticals to technology. There are also good opportunities for those selling services, such as specialist marketing, branding and digital services, and businesses in the creative industries.  Research is vital though, Hedley warns. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get carried away with the size of the market with its 1.3 billion people (including 300 million middle class consumers) and its growth potential,\u201d he says. \u201cIn reality, opportunities are not universal.

On the face of it, watchOS 2 changes very little. Fundamentally the Apple Watch looks, behaves and lasts as long as it did when it launched. There are a few new watchfaces and some new colours for the originals, including a more eye-catching multicolour mode for the Modular watchface.     The London time-lapse watchface. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian    All of the new watchfaces are picture- or video-based, including six time-lapse faces depicting cityscapes in Hong Kong, Mack Lake, Paris, New York, Shanghai and London. They display a video showing 24 hours from a fixed location \u2013 across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament in London\u2019s case. A particular photo or album of photos taken from the Photos app on the iPhone can also be used, with a basic digital clock in the right-hand corner. All the new watchfaces move away from the light-text-on-a-black-background rubric Apple used for the initial set of faces and end up emphasising the small size of the Apple Watch\u2019s screen compared to its body. More complications     Third-party apps can add little widgets called \u2018complications\u2019 on to the watchface. Here Dark Sky displays rain coming soon and Citymapper displays the estimated time of arrival for a planned journey. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian    More interesting are the third-party \u201ccomplications\u201d. Apps such as Dark Sky can insert a small weather-information widget right on the watchface. The number of apps is limited at the moment, but a good example is Citymapper, which puts the estimated time of arrival of any planned journey in a complication. The complications also act as buttons to quickly launch the app, rather than having to hunt for them in the app grid, swipe through a glance or ask Siri. The nightstand mode, which displays the time, date, charge state and next alarm in a green hue reminiscent of monochrome LCD alarm clocks. It works well given the Apple Watch has to be charged over night \u2013 but no change there to battery life. The time is displayed when the screen or buttons are touched, while hitting the side button turns the alarm off or the crown to snooze. It works better on a phone as an alarm clock. Moving forward     The digital crown will scroll forwards or backwards in time, showing events including within some third-party apps and complications. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian    Turning the digital crown on compatible watchfaces now moves forwards or backwards in time. On the modular watchface, for instance, it will scroll through upcoming calendar events, the weather or other interactive elements. That includes new third-party complications such as Dark Sky, which lists the temperature forecast at that particular time. Other watchfaces, such as Astronomy or Solar, will run through their animations when the dial is turned, while you can make Mickey dance by moving his hands backwards and forwards. It\u2019s the little things.         The Mickey Mouse watchface moves as you twist the digital crown.    Beyond amusing animations, I found it quicker to dive into the dedicated app to view my upcoming appointments or weather than it was to turn the crown. Siri does more, from launching glances to starting workouts, but it still feels awkward talking into a watch. Users can also reply to more messages with emojis, dictation and canned responses. Wi-Fi calling is also built-in, which means you don\u2019t need a phone to place a call if being Dick Tracey is your thing and your mobile phone provider supports it \u2013 currently EE and Vodafone in the UK. Apple has also added activation lock for if the smartwatch ever gets stolen \u2013 a feature the iPhone has had for a while and was conspicuously missing when the Apple Watch launched. All about the apps The biggest change has yet to be realised. Apple now allows apps to run directly on the Watch, rather than relying on the iPhone to do all the processing. At the moment, for most apps that means running a little faster. We\u2019re not talking leagues faster \u2013 I still routinely got the loading screen while the app attempted to pull data from the iPhone \u2013 but at least a little.     As with the iPhone and iPad, apps are likely to provide the killer feature for the Apple Watch and now they can do more. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian    Developers can do more now, including accessing the sensors and various hardware features of the Watch, so I suspect that will open the door to much better, more function apps in the future. Most of my niggles with the Apple Watch are still there. The user interface is still inconsistent. For example, you can force touch to clear multiple notifications, but not a single one. Glances are still not actually glanceable, and some third-party ones take a while to load data. And it is still not obvious when you should force touch, when you should swipe left or right, or when you simply have to scroll to the bottom to get stuff done. Apple has fixed one of my original complaints of the Watch, however. One press of the digital crown now takes you back to the watchface from the app grid, rather than centring and then requiring another press. Verdict It doesn\u2019t cost anything, brings a bunch of security fixes, activation lock and unlocks greater app possibilities, so I don\u2019t know why you would not install watchOS on an Apple Watch if you have one. Yes, the Apple Watch is better with watchOS 2, and arguably should have shipped with it out of the box, but none of the new features are revolutionary. The Pebble, for instance, does time travel better and most other smartwatches have a night clock-style mode. Maybe a killer feature will emerge once developers get their hooks into the hardware, but for now the Apple Watch is still not the best smartwatch out there.  Pros: potential for more powerful apps, quicker to get back to the watchface, third-party complications, improved Siri, nightstand mode, Wi-Fi calling Cons: the update took hours, inconsistencies not ironed out, apps can still take a while to load or pull data   Other reviews  Apple Watch review: beautiful hardware spoiled by complicated software Android Wear 5.1 review: simple, useful and the best \u2013 for now ", "tags": ["Apple", "Apple Watch", "Smartwatches", "Wearable technology", "Technology", "Gadgets", "Software"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-24T06:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/shakespeare-world-anti-apartheid-hero-nazi-favourite-bollywood", "sentences": ["Despite Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution \u2013 when Shakespeare was banned \u2013 the country\u2019s most famed translator, Zhu Shenghao, who translated the comedies under Japanese gunfire during the battle for Shanghai in 1937, is now regarded as a patriotic hero of the People\u2019s Republic."], "title": "From Globe to global: a Shakespeare voyage around the world", "article": "It was a Monday morning in central Johannesburg \u2013 September, early spring. Inside the church hall, a cold light streamed on to the hard tile floor. The walls were raw plaster, stained and grey; bars were on the windows. In the centre of the small room were 12 or so plastic garden chairs. Occupying them there were seven men, all of whom were black. They were huddled over cups of instant coffee. Threads of steam gathered and shifted in the air. Abruptly, one man in his late 20s, neatly dressed, stood and turned towards us, fists bunched by his sides. He began to speak:  If there were reason for these miseries, Then into limits could I bind my woes. When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o\u2019erflow? If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad Threat\u2019ning the welkin with his big-swoll\u2019n face?  It took me a few seconds to place the lines: Titus Andronicus, act three, scene one. This is Titus\u2019s \u2013 and perhaps Shakespeare\u2019s \u2013 first truly great tragic speech. Words of desolation, teetering insanity, at the point in the play where the hero realises that his daughter has been raped and appallingly mutilated, and that his sons are about to be killed. Of all the places I\u2019d been expecting to hear them, it wasn\u2019t here.   Related: How Shakespeare\u2019s great escape from the plague changed theatre    The group was called Johannesburg Awakening Minds, Jam for short. It had been in existence just over a year, and mainly consisted of unemployed men, many of whom had been sleeping rough. Corralled by the veteran South African actor Dorothy Ann Gould, its members met once a week to do drama workshops in the inner-city district of Hillbrow. Few had any previous experience of acting. Their specialism was Shakespeare. I talked to them at the break: they had begun by doing contemporary work, but had returned again and again to the classics \u2013 excerpts from Marlowe, the odd sonnet, other poems. The breath control helped, the man who\u2019d performed said; the language was knotty, but mastering it took patience. Life was uncertain, full of instabilities: it was good to be able to focus on something, hone and toughen it. They had just played an arts festival. Some had found work as film extras. They hoped they could one day do Hamlet. Afterwards, they continued rehearsing. Another man, older than the first, stood up and delivered the same speech \u2013 shyly, then with gathering confidence. As he reached the final lines, his body trembled and shook like a swimmer fighting for air: \u201cI am the sea. Hark how her sighs doth blow.\u201d I felt I had never heard the words so clearly. ***     Lars Eidinger in Thomas Ostermeier\u2019s Hamlet. Photograph: Arno Declair    I\u2019m not sure when I first thought of following Shakespeare\u2019s plays out into the numerous worlds they now inhabit; as with many journeys, it only begins to look like a route once you\u2019re already under way. One spur came in the early 2000s, when I found myself in the non-exotic location of a video store in west London. Browsing for something to occupy a dismal February evening, I found myself pausing over a copy of Grigori Kozintsev\u2019s revered 1971 Russian version of King Lear. I carried it home through the drizzle. The battered VHS box looked almost as Soviet-era as the film. The images that now crowd my mind were lodged there, I think, almost immediately. Tarnished greys and flat, mute skies; shadowy hearths from which no warmth ever emanates. The seraphic eyes of the Estonian actor J\u00fcri J\u00e4rvet, playing Lear, dwarfed by his robes of state. As always with Kozintsev, images of people \u2013 farmers on the heath plunging spades into the sod; a torrent of peasants shambling towards Lear\u2019s castle, anxious what the mad old king will do to their country. I speak no Russian, but the text, in Pasternak\u2019s translation, seemed to suit the play\u2019s clotted density and stony non-lyricism, its urgent muttered asides and sclerotic outbursts of poetry. It felt more thrillingly alert than any British version I\u2019d ever seen. Just as importantly, it seemed absolutely true to what the Jacobean Shakespeare, mindful of land enclosures, watchful of his new king, was writing about. Other encounters followed. In Paris in 2012, I interviewed the great director Ariane Mnouchkine, who made her international reputation with a cycle of the English history plays, Richard II to the Henry IVs, invigorated with imagery drawn from Japanese kabuki and Balinese wayang puppetry \u2013 all performed in French. In Berlin the following spring, I spent an afternoon with the bullish, outspoken head of the Schaub\u00fchne theatre, Thomas Ostermeier, debating the German veneration for Hamlet (a tradition to which his own ripped-up, reimagined version offered a gleeful two fingers). Months after that, a producer from Toronto told me that, if one examined the situation with any seriousness, Shakespeare was Canadian. In 2012 Britain hosted the World Shakespeare festival, a six-month jamboree of global Shakespeare that swept theatremakers from nearly 50 countries to these shores. Armenian, Yoruba, Cantonese, Bengali, Lithuanian, Palestinian Arabic: the plays were translated into a Babel of languages, many of which had never been heard on British stages before, and certainly not in dramas by our national poet. I saw as many shows as I could, revelling in Shakespeares that felt both thrillingly remote and familiar. Standing at the Globe or in the foyer at the Barbican, surrounded by audiences younger and more diverse than any I\u2019d seen at the theatre, I began to think that this was perhaps what Shakespeare in the 21st century looked like. Not that everyone seemed willing to admit the fact. London critics trooped out dutifully to see homegrown productions (Timon of Athens at the National; the RSC\u2019s \u201cshipwreck plays\u201d), but turned their noses up at the smorgasbord of global theatre on their doorstep. \u201cWe have quite enough gimmicky Shakespeare of our own,\u201d huffed the Telegraph of a Brazilian Richard III. \u201cDo we really need to import it?\u201d Judging by the recent furore over whether Benedict Cumberbatch and his director Lyndsey Turner were justified in relocating \u201cTo be, or not to be\u201d \u2013 a dramatic experiment so timid it would make directors outside England guffaw \u2013 the answer is surely: yes, it\u2019s about time we did. *** For all that Shakespeare himself probably never left the country \u2013 it\u2019s possible that the furthest south he travelled was Southwark \u2013 I knew a journey exploring his global influence would be a long one. It covered six countries and four continents in the end, nearly 20,000 miles. I found myself in strange places and stranger company; the word \u201cShakespeare\u201d (or Shekesibi, Shashibiya, or Tsikinya-Chaka) opened any number of doors.   Related: Jud S\u00fcss: the Nazis' inglorious blockbuster    Eight months before I reached South Africa, I was in Mumbai, attempting to excavate the roots of Shakespeare in Indian cinema. Much has been made of glossy modern Bollywood adaptations \u2013 Vishal Bhardwaj\u2019s Haider (2014), an action-hero Hamlet set in Kashmir; Ishaqzaade (2012), a contemporary Romeo and Juliet (tagline: \u201cBorn to Hate \u2026 Destined to Love\u201d). In fact the history of Shakespeare reaches back far further, to the dawn of the silent era, when Indian theatre troupes were among the first in the world to commit their Shakespeares to film. The problem is, as I discovered, that almost nothing survives from the early days: dozens of films have frayed into oblivion, photographs and the odd shooting script are all that are left. The oldest surviving Indian Shakespeare movie dates only to 1954, a Hindi-Urdu version of Hamlet (yet again) starring the veteran actor Kishore Sahu. I eventually tracked down a copy to the National Film Archive in Pune, 60 miles south-west of Mumbai \u2013 a low-rise bureaucratic complex that could double as the lair of an especially disreputable section of the Indian intelligence services. Deep in its bowels, in a cluttered and stultifyingly hot room (\u201cNO FOOTWEAR, NO SCREENING\u201d), I found myself astonished, then slowly entranced, by a Hamlet unlike any other I\u2019d seen. The Gravediggers performed a jaunty, faintly demented song. Sahu\u2019s panther-like, lip-curling hero resembled Errol Flynn; Ophelia was very nearly its proto-feminist star. After more detective work back in Mumbai, I tracked down Ophelia herself: the revered Nepalese-Kolkatan actor Mala Sinha, now in her late 70s. Sitting in the matronly splendour of her art-deco mansion, watching clips I\u2019d recorded surreptitiously on my phone, we relived a role she\u2019d essayed as a 16-year-old girl, 60 years before.   Much Ado About Nothing.\" width=\"296\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" />  The cover for Manga Shakespeare version of Much Ado About Nothing.    In India Shakespeare was imposed in the 19th century as a way of making the subcontinent bend to the language \u2013 and the literature \u2013 of its British colonial masters. In other places the influence is more diffuse, and paradoxical. By some curious process, Britain\u2019s national poet has become absorbed into the life-blood of other countries. In 19th-century Germany, unser Shakespeare (\u201cour Shakespeare\u201d) was acclaimed as the fledgling nation\u2019s most important poet after Goethe and Schiller; the German Shakespeare Society in Weimar is the oldest organisation of its kind anywhere in the world. Later and more dubiously, Shakespeare became the only \u201cenemy dramatist\u201d to be co-opted by the Nazis. Hitler owned translations of the plays and once sketched out scene designs for a production of Julius Caesar, while Joseph Goebbels \u2013 who had completed a PhD in 19th-century drama and spent the 1920s failing to make a name as a novelist and playwright \u2013 revered this \u201chuge genius \u2026 more modern than the moderns\u201d. Goebbels\u2019s propaganda ministry expended a remarkable amount of effort and money arguing that, to any rational observer, Shakespeare was more culturally German than many Germans. Soon after the declaration of hostilities with Britain, Wille und Macht magazine ran a special issue proposing that he held his own \u201cin the face of the enemy\u201d. Even after years of war, one of the final projects to cross the Reichsminister\u2019s desk in 1944 was a lavish movie of The Merchant of Venice directed by Veit Harlan, who had made the notoriously anti-semitic film Jud S\u00fcss. But then, of course, the British were not above using Shakespeare for their own ends, as attested to by Fleet Air Arm lieutenant Laurence Olivier\u2019s Henry V, released the same year and stirringly dedicated to the forces massing on Germany\u2019s borders. In America, the process of appropriation began even earlier, when the Founding Fathers were among the first to hymn the praises of a writer John Adams called the \u201cGreat Master of Nature\u201d. Adams and Jefferson were sufficiently moved that they made a pilgrimage to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1786, and became the first in a long line of American tourists to be underwhelmed by what they saw (the birthplace was \u201cas small and mean as you can conceive\u201d, Adams wrote).    The American Founding Fathers were among the first to sing the praises of the 'Great Master of Nature'    American Bardolatry very much lives on, enshrined in the splendid marble edifice of the Folger Shakespeare Library on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, whose very location \u2013 in the shadow of the Capitol, across the street from the supreme court \u2013 bespeaks Shakespeare\u2019s significance to a certain strain of American life. The Folger is also home to the largest collection of First Folios in the world: 82 copies to the British Library\u2019s seven. One in the eye for the Limeys. *** My discoveries on these journeys were not always happy. After meeting Johannesburg Awakening Minds, I spent three exhausting, depressing weeks in South Africa attempting to pin down the real story behind a copy of Shakespeare\u2019s complete works kept on Robben Island and signed by key figures in the struggle against apartheid, Nelson Mandela included. The book was passed around from cell to solitary cell in the late 1970s, 33 prisoners signing passages of text that resonated with them. Mandela chose a section from Julius Caesar: \u201cCowards die many times before their deaths; / The valiant never taste of death but once.\u201d The \u201cRobben Island Bible\u201d, as the book has reverently become known, has been feted in the west in the years since South Africa became a democratic nation, appearing at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford, the British Museum, the Folger, and most recently in Glasgow for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Attracted by the story it appears to tell \u2013 most of all by the connection with Mandela \u2013 commentators have rushed to portray the book as a potent symbol of intellectual freedom, a burning torch in the dark, affirming Shakespeare\u2019s centrality to the fight in apartheid\u2019s most notorious penitentiary.   Maqbool, a 2003 Bollywood production of Macbeth.\" width=\"300\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" />  A poster for Maqbool, a 2003 Bollywood production of Macbeth.    As with all symbols, the truth (or as much of it as I could uncover) is more complex and contested: the signatures are authentic, but the ANC has publicly disowned the book. It has never been exhibited in South Africa. Even its owner, Sonny Venkatrathnam, whom I visited at his modest house in Durban, was unsure how much it had really been read. It would take another book again to unravel the complexities behind the \u201cBible\u201d, but one conclusion seems stark: in a country with a traumatised colonial history such as South Africa (or India, or Nigeria, or Hong Kong) the relationship between the British empire\u2019s anointed playwright and the peoples on whom his work was imposed remains fraught. But then it is a professional hazard of searching for Shakespeare that the best stories are not always what they seem. I began my journeys believing a fable that has captured many imaginations: that Hamlet and Richard II were performed by the crew of an East India Company ship, the Dragon, moored in Sierra Leone in September 1607 (they are reputed to have given a repeat performance of Hamlet the following March, by now off the other coast of Africa). Unearthed by Edwardian scholars as a tale of English naval derring-do, reanimated more recently by post-colonial critics eager to find a cosmopolitan, multicultural Shakespeare in their own image, the Sierra Leone story is deliciously appealing \u2013 or would be, if it were true. The most cursory examination of the documents reveals holes (the original account has mysteriously disappeared; other shipboard diaries contradict it; there are no other records of English sailors performing drama in the period). Even its most enthusiastic adherents admit the whole thing may be a fiction, quite possibly a forgery. Much as we would love to believe that Hamlet was performed during its author\u2019s lifetime in West Africa \u2013 I for one wish it were true \u2013 we might have to accept that Shakespeare, that most evasive and slippery of figures, doesn\u2019t always turn up on cue. *** So if not on Robben Island or in early-modern Sierra Leone, where? What does Shakespeare look like globally in 2015? The first generalisation is that all generalisations are suspect: five years of research and three years of intermittent journeying have reminded me, painfully and repeatedly, how much there is to know. The Shakespeare universe is, like the universe itself, expanding faster than anyone can keep up. I wish I\u2019d been able to find space (and time) to venture further into Russia, France and Japan, nations with proud Shakespearian histories, and to do more than perfunctory research into South America. The relationship between Islamic studies and early-modern literature is hugely exciting; a friend I met on the road in Delhi is doing absorbing research into performances in those grimly symbolic 21st-century locations, refugee camps. It is impossible to be confident of numbers, but it seems plausible to me that well over a billion people globally have come into contact with Shakespeare \u2013 if not at school, where translations are a fixture on many curriculums, then in live cinema broadcasts and TV adaptations, illegal movie streams, or in Charles and Mary Lamb\u2019s endlessly translated 1807 Tales from Shakespeare. A few months after I returned to Britain from India, someone uploaded to YouTube a bootleg copy of the 1954 Hamlet I schlepped all the way to Pune to see. Once I had swallowed my chagrin, I was forced to admit this was progress.     Meera Syal and Paul Bhattacharjee in rehearsals for Much Ado About Nothing at the Courtyard, Stratford-upon-Avon. Photograph: PA    Is all this Shakespeare, or at least the Shakespeare many of us would recognise? Translators speak eloquently about the exquisite torture of rendering Elizabethan puns and blank verse in Polish and German, isiXhosa and Setswana. In China, the problem is especially fascinating: with four tones and its endless array of homophones, literary Mandarin is not even the most complex of Sinitic languages, but is forbiddingly distant from the early modern English Jacobethans spoke and wrote in. Cantonese \u2013 six tones, hungrily expansive in its vocabulary \u2013 is even more distant. Even so, China too has done its utmost to understand and assimilate \u201cOld Man Sha\u201d, starting with the omnipresent Lamb\u2019s Tales, versions of which became surprisingly racy short fiction in the 1900s and 1910s, and continuing through the era of contemporary modernist directors such as Tian Qinxin and Lin Zhaohua, both of whom have become prominent internationally. Despite Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution \u2013 when Shakespeare was banned \u2013 the country\u2019s most famed translator, Zhu Shenghao, who translated the comedies under Japanese gunfire during the battle for Shanghai in 1937, is now regarded as a patriotic hero of the People\u2019s Republic. The irony might have appealed to Shakespeare. Even if these Shakespeares are different from most British versions, so what? They are no less valid. Every performance of a play in whatever language is itself a form of translation \u2013 an attempt to interpret and reanimate sparse and often enigmatic texts. And in encountering the plays in modern Hindi or Arabic or Yoruba, non-English-speaking audiences get to experience a Shakespeare who is \u2013 as the Polish critic Jan Kott once claimed \u2013 genuinely a contemporary. Perhaps it is we, hunting through glossaries and footnotes, attempting to decode 400-year-old words we no longer quite speak, who lose something.   Related: Jeanette Winterson on writing a cover version of Shakespeare    Shakespeare\u2019s Globe in London is currently touring an English-language production of Hamlet across the world. It\u2019s a bold project, but one that seems to me strangely out of step with how Shakespeare already exists globally, in a jumble of languages, variations, refashionings, performance styles. For audiences or performers exposed to multiple Bollywood Comedies of Errors or Canadian sitcoms such as Slings &amp; Arrows or Japanese manga versions (hugely popular across Asia), the \u201creal\u201d thing perhaps looks rather quaint. When I asked a group of smart and well-informed students in Hong Kong whether Shakespeare\u2019s Britishness mattered to them, there was genuine puzzlement; working on a Cantonese Taming of the Shrew, several had only the haziest sense where its author was born. It may trouble some Britons to accept that we don\u2019t necessarily know best, that theatres on Bankside or in Stratford-upon-Avon are no longer the centre of the Shakespearean world. But we need to accept exactly that. As the works are translated and performed afresh, they continue to adjust, adapt, acclimatise, breeding promiscuously with other cultures, sometimes evolving into something altogether unrecognisable. That is exactly as it should be: as Shakespeare well understood, the plays are living organisms created in collaboration with actors, costumiers, technicians, musicians \u2013 and with the most important collaborators of all, the audience. They change each and every time they are brought to life. In this, as so much else, he got there long before us. *** I will find it hard to give up the voyage of discovery: I\u2019ve barely had a chance to explore the North American festival scene, the largest and most vibrant in the world; and the friend who does research in refugee camps tells absorbing tales.

In a statement released by the White House on Friday, the two countries \u2013 which are the largest markets for illegal ivory \u2013 said they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory. The ban would cover \u201csignificant and timely restrictions on the import of ivory as hunting trophies\u201d as well as unspecified \u201csignificant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory.\u201d China is the biggest market for poached ivory with some estimates putting the US in second place. The announcement follows a decision by China to phase out the legal, domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May.  In December, a report released by Save the Elephants and the Aspinall Foundation found that the wholesale price of raw elephant tusks had tripled in just four years since 2010. Cutting the supply of ivory to the Chinese market is seen as an crucial step in reducing the loss of Africa\u2019s elephants to poaching.

Support for a ban on the ivory trade is high in China according to a March 2015 survey conducted by WildAid, African Wildlife Foundation and Save The Elephants.  Ninety-five per cent of respondents surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou said that the government should impose an ivory sales ban. The survey also found that awareness of ivory poaching had increased by 50% since 2012.

Despite renewed competition from the US studios after the summer embargo, Xu Zheng\u2019s comedy Lost in Hong Kong has posted a Chinese debut very close to $100m (\u00a366m, though precise figures aren\u2019t confirmed yet) \u2013 the highest for a live-action comedy anywhere. That includes a $31.3m opening-day gross that is a record for a local film, and China\u2019s third-highest ever behind Fast &amp; Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron. The overall opening looks a little short of the newly crowned local box-office champ Monster Hunt\u2019s in July ($107m), and depending on the final figure, it\u2019s either the country\u2019s fourth or fifth highest overall. Setting a comedy record with such verve feels significant, an indication that China\u2019s burgeoning cinema attendance may be slowly fuelling a new capability and confidence in genres outside the ones the country has traditionally majored in. Lost in Hong Kong is Xu\u2019s follow-up to the 2012 surprise hit Lost in Thailand, the so-called \u201cChinese Hangover\u201d that was, for a couple of years, the most successful local film ($208m). It\u2019s effectively the third in a comedy franchise, which began with 2010\u2019s much less successful Lost on Journey, invariably featuring Xu as a stressed-out Planes, Trains and Automobiles-style voyager saddled with irksome road companions. This time he plays a former artist who takes his wife (played by fellow box-office draw Vicki Zhao) and video camera-toting brother-in-law on a trip to Kowloon, secretly hoping to meet his first love. Massive anticipation obviously bolstered Lost in Hong Kong\u2019s commercial clout, and it also benefited from what has been described as the widest opening-day release in history (100,000 showings on 20,000 screens). Hence the clear distance between it and previous big live-action comedy openers: Breakup Buddies, $94.1m; The Hangover Part II, $85.9m; Austin Powers in Goldmember, $73.1m ($96.4m inflation-adjusted); Bruce Almighty, $68m ($88m adjusted); Hancock, $62.6m. Judged on box-office heft alone, it\u2019s incredible to think that Xu, almost completely unknown in the west, is a comedy force greater than the likes of Judd Apatow, Todd Phillips and Adam McKay. Lost in Hong Kong also took a handy $559,000 in the US, receiving mostly appreciative reviews: Variety deemed it a \u201ctamer but still agreeable follow-up\u201d to Lost in Thailand, while the New York Times said \u201cit tries too hard to be too many things\u201d before cryptically conceding that \u201cno one comes out smelling like a durian\u201d. Now it\u2019s up to Lost in Hong Kong to display more longevity than last year\u2019s Breakup Buddies \u2013 which also starred Xu and set a worldwide comedy-debut record \u2013 if it\u2019s going to break into the top five most successful comedies list. It would be in the company, interestingly, of another non-English language title: the French-made Intouchables ($444.7m), currently in third place, alongside Hancock ($624.3m), Pretty Woman ($463.4m), Sex and the City ($415.2m) and What Women Want ($415.2m). Most of these are romcoms, and all received wide international distribution, so Lost in Hong Kong will be hard-pressed to compete \u2013 but $300m is eminently achievable. The grey niche     Age of seniority \u2026 Christina Scherer, Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway in The Intern. Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros    It\u2019s a new era for writer-director Nancy Meyers, downsizing to a $35m budget for The Intern after a run of glossy $80m-plus dramedies Something\u2019s Gotta Give and The Holiday in the mid-2000s. All the more reason to be encouraged by a firm $18.2m US box-office debut for The Intern, helped by a tidy, high-concept premise \u2013 Robert De Niro\u2019s seventysomething widower filling a post at Anne Hathaway\u2019s internet startup \u2013 and, inadvertently, by a well-publicised interview walkout by the actor.  Meyers shouldn\u2019t just be feeling confident because of her new fiscal regime: this kind of seniors-oriented material, such as The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel ($136m worldwide) and Red ($199m), has carved out its own market niche in recent years. But her past work stands above this trend, with each of her last four films grossing over $200m. Her smoothly comic drama, aspirational settings and judicious deployment of star firepower, whether in isolation (Mel Gibson in What Women Want) or ensemble (The Holiday), give her a broad, generous appeal that travels well. The UK, Germany and Australia, all affluent countries with ageing demographics, have been the mainstay markets for her work, and will be key to The Intern. Of those three, only Germany opened in this week\u2019s first round of 41 territories (the UK and Australia follow next week); it was surprisingly down on Meyer\u2019s last film, It\u2019s Complicated: $1.5m compared to $2.4m. But there were gains in Russia (The Intern: $1.4m; It\u2019s Complicated: $1.2m) and South Korea ($2.7m; 544,000) \u2013 the latter being the kind of highly developed, non-Anglophone market you would have thought would be high priority, along with Japan and China, in Warner\u2019s game plan for Meyers.  The bloodsucker     Welcome to the Hotel Transylvania. Photograph: Sony Pictures Animation/AP    Modest progress for Hotel Transylvania, Sony Animation\u2019s representative in the cuddly-villain game: a $47.5m US debut for the second in the series that crept past the original\u2019s $42.5m for a new September record (though the month is the lowest-grossing in the calendar, with no $50m-plus opening thus far). A long wait, since Minions in July, for anything with that shiny CGI-animation lustre \u2013 which probably played a part. Reviews haven\u2019t been especially kind to the sequel, co-written by Dracula-voicing lead actor Adam Sandler, which scrapes the creative trough already well gouged by such films as Despicable Me. But the franchising effect appears to be taking hold anyway, with gains across most of Latin America, which seems to have a taste for mock-gothic: Mexico, $7.9m (+127%), Brazil, $2.7m (-4%), Argentina, $1.3m (+35%), Colombia, $1.2m (+29%), Peru, $1.1m (+40%). Hotel Transylvania still remains very much the underling of the faux-fiendish brigade. In the $80-85m range, Sony\u2019s franchise is budgeted slightly higher than Universal\u2019s $70-75m Despicable Me; and with the first Hotel taking $358.3m globally, it\u2019s not quite up there with Gru nor with Minions\u2019 gross, which recently breached $1bn. Judging by this weekend, Hotel Transylvania 2 may be looking at $500m \u2013 moderately spine-tingling. Beyond Hollywood            Squashed into No 2 spot in China by Lost in Hong Kong was romantic drama The Third Way of Love, in 11th place globally with $7.5m. A South Korean-Chinese co-production, both behind the scenes and onscreen, it pairs Song Seung-heon and Liu Yifei as a Korean playboy and a Shanghai lawyer who fall for each other. The only other non-Hollywood new entry was Korean comedy The Accidental Detective, 19th globally with $3.3m, an observe and report-style caper about a comic-book shop owner obsessed with becoming a policeman. It\u2019s dropped off the chart now, but this is a good time to mention that Krays biopic Legend has now become the UK\u2019s highest grossing homegrown 18 certificate ever, its $20.2m cumulative take passing Trainspotting\u2019s (unadjusted) $18.8m. Tom Hardy\u2019s double-trouble act ventures cautiously outside home turf over the autumn and into the new year. The future            The Intern expands to another 15 or so territories, including (as noted) past Meyers stalwarts, the UK and Australia. The major new studio release is Ridley Scott\u2019s The Martian, teasing out more of the intriguing thread of vulnerability in Matt Damon\u2019s filmography and casting him as an astronaut stranded on Mars with a top-notch supporting cast (including Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor) trying to get him back to Earth. Launching wide in its first week, in nearly 50 territories \u2013 almost everywhere apart from the Middle East and sundry European stragglers \u2013 The Martian will be sizing itself up against Scott\u2019s last film Prometheus\u2019s $403.4m worldwide, though it is a very different strain of sci-fi. In China, thriller Saving Mr Wu is the flashiest of three local releases looking to steal some of Lost in Hong Kong\u2019s heat \u2013 it stars Andy Lau, meta-ing it up as a kidnapped Hong Kong film star. And the last in 2015\u2019s seemingly weekly parade of Akshay Kumar releases is Singh Is Bliing, reteaming the actor with director Prabhu Deva after the pair scored big with 2012\u2019s Rowdy Rathore. Fairly cheap ($10.6m) for a Bollywood blockbuster, the film\u2019s trailer is heavy \u2013 with Kumar playing a swaggering Sikh \u2013 on the monster-sized turbans.

And the economic situation is not good in Europe, either.\u201d Asian markets were feeling the fallout from China, where a survey of industrial firms published on Monday showed an 8.8% year-on-year decline in profits in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a statistic that usually doesn\u2019t affect stock markets, but due to the breadth of the fall, the outlook on China\u2019s slowdown and its likely global effects has darkened significantly,\u201d Chihiro Ota, general manager of investment research at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Kyodo News. The yen, considered a safe haven by investors in times of market tumult, strengthened against the dollar, with the US currency trading in the 119-yen range on Tuesday morning. Recent surges by the yen have caused alarm in Tokyo, since a stronger yen hits profits made overseas by Japanese manufacturers, the driving force of the world\u2019s third-biggest economy.

Japan\u2019s Topix iron and steel subindex lost 5.2%, with Kobe Steel slumping 11.1% after it cut its earnings outlook. \u201cThe steel sector has been heavily impacted by China\u2019s slowdown because more than 50% of the demand is there,\u201d said Takashi Enomoto, an analyst at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut Japanese steel companies will be hurt a little less than others by the shrinking demand because of the domestic demand from automotive players.\u201d The week had already got off to a rocky start, with all major indices on Wall Street closing sharply down on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 index hit a one-month low on bullish US consumer spending data in August as it raised concerns the Federal Reserve could hike rates at a time of slackening global growth. Although the Fed decided not to raise interest rates at its meeting earlier this month - citing concern over China \u2013 speculation is building that the central bank could approve a rate hike as early as next month. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac in Sydney, said: \u201cMarkets have heard such talk before and with equities under pressure, it was hard to take rate hike talk seriously.\u201d  ", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Chinese economy", "Business", "China", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US economy", "Economics", "Global economy"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-29T04:55:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/30/goal-celebrations-vehicles-the-knowledge", "sentences": ["\u201cLast week a Shanghai Shenhua fan threw an iPhone at Diego Tardelli during a game,\u201d writes Dean Carr."], "title": "Goal celebrations involving vehicles | The Knowledge", "article": "\u201cHas anyone else ever celebrated a goal using a vehicle?\u201d wonders Katherine Watson. \u201cOr is Mariano Gorosito the first?\u201d Gorosito\u2019s slightly ill-advised stint as an ambulance driver after scoring for FC Luj\u00e1n in the Argentinian third tier may have been the first goal celebration to involve an emergency vehicle but he\u2019s not the first to get behind the wheel after scoring.

ROUND THE WORLD WITH WAYNE \u201cThere has been a lot of talk about Wayne Rooney becoming England\u2019s leading goal scorer,\u201d noted the magnificently named George Tough last week. \u201cA few of these have been against a small number of teams. But who of England\u2019s scorers has netted against the most different teams?\u201d Malcolm Warburton, Richard Finch, Adam Stevens and Richard Baum all emailed in to point out that Rooney and Michael Owen are joint leaders in this regard. Rooney\u2019s 50 goals have come against 26 different teams, as did Owen\u2019s 40. FANS SUPPORTING RIVALS (2) Last week we looked at the supporters who have cheered on the opposition and, as ever, several readers have been in touch to point out a few more examples. \u201cIn May 2010 Lazio played Inter at home with Lazio still not being safe from the drop and Inter in the top spot feeling Roma breathing down their necks with only a few rounds to go,\u201d writes J\u00f6rg Michner. \u201cIf Roma managed to overtake Inter and win the Scudetto it would obviously be a disaster of epic proportions for the Laziali. In the run-up to the match the Ultras told the Lazio squad in no uncertain terms they had to lose or face violent repercussions. \u201cFrom the very first kick the Laziali cheered on the Inter players and booed their own team the moment they entered the Inter half. Moves that even remotely resembled an attack were met with jeers and whistles. When Inter finally broke the deadlock the Laziali celebrated fiercely and held up a beautifully sarcastic banner. \u201cAfter the goal the match descended into a training exercise with both teams knowing the race was run much to the delight of the Lazio faithful who are historically twinned, ie best buddies, with the Interisti anyway. Inter doubled their lead and went on to win the title and eventually the triple. The Guardian\u2019s very own Paolo Bandini offers a few more details in his match report.\u201d And, in a similar vein, here\u2019s Pete McQue Jr: \u201cIn 1995 Blackburn and Manchester United were going for the Premier League title and it went down to the final day. Man Utd went to West Ham and Blackburn had to visit my beloved Liverpool at Anfield. If Blackburn lost and Man Utd won, we faced the prospect of handing the title to the Mancs. \u201cGradually this idea spread that we should be supporting Blackburn. A lot of people took this seriously. On the final day a lot of people turned up wearing Blackburn shirts, including me, and this was actively encouraged among the fans. In the Kop there was a lot of blue and white, and it was not worn by Blackburn fans who had snuck in. \u201cThe Liverpool players didn\u2019t get the memo and from memory, Barnes and Redknapp scored to bring us a 2-1 victory. Fortunately West Ham kept Man Utd from taking advantage, and it ended up being the perfect day. Blackburn were champions, we\u2019d beaten the champions and the Mancs had been frustrated by a result they never saw coming.\u201d And Robin Clarke points to this game at Brisbane Road in 1972, when Leyton Orient fans were none too disappointed to see their side lose to Birmingham and deny Millwall promotion from the second division. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cOver a few beers last week a friend regaled me with a tale that included the rather random fact that John Hartson once stole a sheep but I have no means to check the veracity of the story,\u201d wrote a bemused Phil Sedgewood in 2007. \u201cSay it ain\u2019t so.\u201d Sadly, Phil, it isn\u2019t just defenders, scales and Eyal Berkovic who have been given a fright during the Welshman\u2019s career but also our woolly four-legged friends. \u201cI was at Luton and two of my Swansea mates, Jason Wright and Kevin Davis, came up for some fun,\u201d Hartson told the Sunday People in an interview. \u201cWe got absolutely lashed and, at about three in the morning, we found the minibus that was to take us back to my place. On the way we stopped beside a field and stole a sheep that was minding her own business, threw her in the back of the van and then drove on home for a sleep. \u201cThere was understandable pandemonium in the morning. I had a hangover and I\u2019d completely forgotten about the sheep, which was roaming around the back garden in a state of some distress. We bundled her back in the van and dropped her off in the first field we found with sheep in it. Somehow we got away with it.\u201d For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? \u201cLast week a Shanghai Shenhua fan threw an iPhone at Diego Tardelli during a game,\u201d writes Dean Carr. \u201cWould that be the most expensive object ever launched at a player?\u201d \u201cI have recently returned from a stint volunteering in a rural community in Nicaragua, Central America,\u201d writes Alexander Marullo. \u201cTo pass time in the evenings I played a substantial amount of football with the locals. Despite the rather basic playing conditions (waterlogged pitches, rocks, stray cows etc) I got on pretty well due to the local standard not being especially high; baseball is of course more popular than football in a number of Latin American countries including Nicaragua. I was told the local teams such as Real Madriz of the Nicaraguan First Division often recruited from communities like the one in which I was based. While not being arrogant enough to believe I would be good enough to play in the local leagues it did get me thinking. Has any Englishman (or Brit) ever played professionally or semi-professionally in Central America or anywhere equally as obscure, the more obscure the better?\u201d \u201cHere in Japan, 41-year-old defender Yukio Tsuchiya is still a regular for Ventforet Kofu in the J-League,\u201d writes Alistair Bourne. \u201cHis squad number is \u2026 41. Is Tsuchiya the oldest professional player to match his shirt number with his age?\u201d \u201cMy friend and I are connoisseurs of what we call the hat-trick race,\u201d begins Sam Waller. \u201cThis is when two or more players from either team have scored a brace of goals and remain on the pitch \u2013 the race of course being who will get a third goal and complete their hat-trick first. We thought we\u2019d spotted a three-way hat-trick race when Jay Rodriguez, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Shane Long each scored twice for Southampton against MK Dons. However upon closer inspection, as Man\u00e9 was substituted before Long\u2019s first goal, this was actually two two-way races (Man\u00e9 v Rodriguez and Rodriquez v Long). \u201cThere have been at least two genuine three-way races in the Premier League in recent years. When my beloved Newcastle lost 7-3 at Arsenal in 2012, Demba Ba, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott were all on a hat-trick and on the pitch at the same time. Walcott won the race by scoring his third in injury time. The feat was repeated last year when Liverpool won 6-3 at Cardiff, Luis Su\u00e1rez winning the race with Martin Skrtel and Jordon Mutch thanks to a last minute goal.

After a summer of wild swings, sparked by growing fears of a slowdown in China, leading shares have slumped from the record highs of a few months earlier, and recorded their second quarterly decline in a row. The MSCI all-country world index, which monitors 23 developed and 23 emerging markets, has fallen nearly 11.5% since 30 June, marking its poorest quarterly outcome since the three months to September 2011. The FTSE 100 index, which hit a record high of 7,103 in April, fell below 6,000 during the quarter and is down 7% over the three months despite a 152-point bounce on Wednesday to a close of 6,061.  Since the end of June, the UK\u2019s leading index has seen \u00a3117bn wiped off its value. Again, this is its worst performance since the three months to September 2011 when it fell 13.7%. The poorest performer among global markets is the Shanghai composite index, down 26% since the start of July and suffering its worst quarter since 2008. Elsewhere, the FTSE emerging markets index is down more than 19% over the quarter, Germany\u2019s Dax is down nearly 12%, and in the US the Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500 have dropped nearly 8%. The rout began in earnest in early August, when China tried to boost its flagging economy with the biggest one-day devaluation of the country\u2019s currency, the yuan, in 20 years. The move was followed by further reductions in the yen\u2019s value and sent shockwaves through markets, with investors fearing the country\u2019s rapid economic growth was running out of steam.  Commodity prices slumped on concerns about slowing demand, with mining companies which had invested heavily facing the prospect of falling sales at the same time as they had run up significant debt. The commodity trader and mining group Glencore was a major victim of these worries, losing 40% of its value in the last month alone. At the same time, the prospect of a rise in US interest rates has been coming closer despite the concerns about China and global growth. Emerging markets, which had been boosted by the cheap money pumped out by the central banks, the US Federal Reserve in particular, came under intense pressure, with the International Monetary Fund warning on Tuesday that rising rates could see a new credit crisis when borrowing costs rose. Other factors hitting shares included the Volkswagen scandal, with the carmaker\u2019s admission it had cheated on diesel emissions tests sending motor manufacturers\u2019 shares sharply lower on the basis the whole industry could come under intense scrutiny.   MSCI all-country world ndex MSCI all-country world ndex   And this month\u2019s comments from the US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton that she would clamp down on pharmaceutical costs \u2013 after the New York firm Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a drug used by Aids patients by a staggering 5,000% \u2013 hit shares in drug companies. So despite a bounce on Wednesday, prompted partly by hopes of further quantitative easing from the European Central Bank after the eurozone fell back into deflation, markets remain volatile. The latest Chinese purchasing managers index on Thursday and the US non-farm payrolls on Friday are likely to prompt further uncertainty. Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said recent market falls had usually prompted investors to return to equities before too long in search of a bargain, sending shares higher once more.  But, he said, this time may be different: \u201cGiven the volatility seen in the past couple of months there is a feeling that something may have changed with the slow slide in commodity prices since the peaks of 2011 starting to sow some significant seeds of concern about where the next catalyst for a move higher will come from. \u201cWhen commodity prices bottomed in 2008, the combined effects of a Chinese stimulus programme and US quantitative easing saw a swift about-turn in prices in a matter of months. It\u2019s hard to see something similar happening now with oil and mining companies taking a scalpel to capital expenditure in large chunks.\u201d  Hewson added: \u201cFurthermore, investors are having to contend with a US Federal Reserve looking to tighten policy and not loosen it, raising concerns about the debt profiles of a good part of the basic resource sector, at a time when revenues are likely to remain under pressure due to low prices.  \u201cWhile commodity prices may rise eventually there still remains a great deal of excess capacity in the mining and oil and gas sector, which still needs to be worked through. It is against this backdrop that investors are voting with their feet and reverting to cash and other safer havens.\u201d Even some of those havens have been under pressure, with gold recording its worst quarterly loss in a year as investors worried about the cost of holding the metal, which is priced in dollars, when a US rate rise could be on the way.", "tags": ["Business", "Stock markets", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Economics"], "publicationDate": "2015-09-30T12:40:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/oct/01/mastery-differentiation-new-classroom-buzzword", "sentences": ["It\u2019s caught the attention of policymakers, and earlier this year the Department for Education flew in teachers from Shanghai to raise standards with their \u201cmastery\u201d style."], "title": "Differentiation is out. Mastery is the new classroom buzzword", "article": "Schools will witness a shift in jargon this year. Differentiation is out. Mastery is in. Mark my words. In his memoir, An Intelligent Person\u2019s Guide to Education, former Eton headmaster Tony Little recounts the delightful story of workmen at the school uncovering fragments of a wall painting under some wood panelling. The images, from around 1520, are believed to be the earliest representation of a school scene in England. A banner headline from Roman scholar Quintilian crowns the scene \u201cVirtuo preceptoris est ingeniorum notare discrimina\u201d, meaning \u201cthe excellence of the teacher is to identify the difference in talents of students\u201d. Or, in a word, differentiation. It\u2019s not a complex idea, but differentiation is difficult to get right. All teachers know that matching their teaching to students\u2019 various needs, aptitudes and preferred styles of learning is the key challenge in a classroom. The fact that teachers have to do this for 30 students at once makes it even more difficult. You could have an entire teaching career of purposeful practice \u2013 more than 10,000 hours \u2013 and still not quite crack it.   Related: Why are we blindly following the Chinese approach to teaching maths?    Different cultures treat differentiation in different ways. I remember training high school teachers in New York and being told that they \u201cdifferentiate by sending students to different rooms\u201d. While teaching in the Middle East I learned that deep cultural assumptions lead to differentiation by gender and age; boys are taught in morning classes, girls in the afternoon. But recently a dose of an eastern-inspired \u201cmastery\u201d has entered our schools, with the impact in maths being measured by an Education Endowment Foundation report. It\u2019s caught the attention of policymakers, and earlier this year the Department for Education flew in teachers from Shanghai to raise standards with their \u201cmastery\u201d style. The Oxford University Press has also produced a paper exploring mastery in maths and how it can raise achievement. The national curriculum frameworks for English and maths are now rooted in it. At the heart of the Chinese classroom is the teacher\u2019s unshakeable belief that all children are capable of learning anything if that learning is presented in the right way. The idea works on the basis that understanding is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution, and that difficulty is pleasurable. In lessons where mastery is practised, teachers ensure that at least once or twice in a session the students are in awe of the teacher\u2019s own scholarship. Pupils are encouraged to wonder how the teacher worked out a conundrum. The idea is that their interest will be piqued and they will want to be able to do it too. The teacher \u2013 like a seasoned stand-up comic judging how long to keep his audience on hold \u2013 will then share an inventive clue, comment or question to enable the pupils to reveal their own knowledge and skills.The penny drops. The pleasure on their faces is clear. One benefit of this approach is that it avoids the negative potential of differentiation which, if we are not careful, can lead to depressed expectations of what \u201cless able\u201d pupils can achieve. Activities can be oversimplified; the challenge for deeper learning removed. The completion of the task at a lower level is the learner\u2019s modest prize.   Related: Can neuroscience solve the mystery of how students learn?    Mastery also allows teachers to really challenge students. Many teachers in our risk-averse culture are wary of pushing students intellectually in the classroom. A great teacher I know says that when the 10-year-olds in her class make a maths error, she asserts an instant \u201cwrong\u201d. The brighter the child, the sharper her \u201cwrong\u201d will be. At times she is moved to say \u201cwise mistake\u201d \u2013 but that\u2019s as complimentary as it gets. Years of inspirational primary practice have taught her that children don\u2019t want to hear false praise or be asked to talk in pairs when they make a number error. The child wants to work it out, get a similar question right next time and the time after that. It\u2019s a similar mindset to the world of elite sport. For example, the Olympic runner Mo Farah has said flatly that he can \u2013 and must \u2013 become better, run faster. He said it when he was unknown, and he\u2019ll probably say it after his best season. He is pursuing mastery, in the knowledge that he\u2019ll never reach it. It will always hover beyond his grasp. For most mortals anywhere in the world, acquiring a new skill is a mix of perspiration, repetition, frustration, humour and light-bulb moments. Mastery attracts precisely because it also eludes. As the school year unfolds, it will be interesting to see what teachers and students make of the new buzzword. Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.

I wanted to find a new medium, a more contemporary one that could still capture the spirit of landscape painting. Digital photography seemed to be the answer. In China, landscape painting is less about describing the real physical world, and more about illustrating a mental state, a spirit \u2013 expressing your feelings in each ink stroke. Artists down the generations tend to paint the same landscape in different ways, according to what\u2019s in their inner mind. In many ways, this is the opposite to western art. Chinese artists may present multiple perspectives in a single piece. It\u2019s about seeing and showing objects beyond how they are.   Related: Prix Pictet prize 2015: shortlist captures theme of disorder \u2013 in pictures    These artists also try to express eternity. There is no division between morning and night. Shadows are never shown, sunset and sunrise never mentioned. In western art, people tend to depict a moment \u2013 the afternoon in a certain season, for example. But Chinese artists tend to portray landscapes as going unchanged throughout time. It has to do with traditional philosophy: life goes round like a circle, coming and going again and again. Whatever happens in one day doesn\u2019t matter that much. With images like this, I make references to traditional painting. First I do a pencil sketch, then I insert photos piece by piece digitally, to create a new landscape. I draw from a large database of pictures I\u2019ve taken in the last 10 years: planes, railways, whatever. This picture took six months to finish. Growing up in Shanghai, I was surrounded by lots of traditional architecture \u2013 and saw a lot of it removed. China has changed so much, dismantling its heritage in the pursuit of urbanisation. I want to ask questions about these things, about consumerism and how we live today. The rate of change is a major concern. To catch up with western economies, a lot of local customs are being lost \u2013 even the way we eat, the way we talk. It is the same with contemporary art. It feels like great traditions are being given up, at least partially, as we switch to the western idea of not only making art, but marketing and selling it.     Photographer Yang Yongliang.

While more than 230 cities were affected by flooding in 2013, 90% of older urban areas do not even have basic flood plans, say officials.     Chinese students make their way across a flooded school compound in Wuhan in central China\u2019s Hubei province. Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    China has now chosen 16 urban districts across the country, including Wuhan, Chongqing and Xiamen, to become pilot sponge cities. Over the next three years, each will receive up to 600m yuan (\u00a362m) to develop ponds, filtration pools and wetlands, as well as to build permeable roads and public spaces that enable stormwater to soak into the ground. Ultimately, the plan is to manage 60% of rainwater falling in the cities.  \u201cA sponge city follows the philosophy of innovation: that a city can solve water problems instead of creating them. In the long run, sponge cities will reduce carbon emissions and help fight climate change,\u201d says Qiu Baoxing, a former vice-minister of housing and urban-rural development. How sponge cities work Domestic rainwater harvesting is nothing new. Many homeowners have a rain barrel to collect the water falling on their roofs and use it for watering plants or cleaning. Scaling this up to large apartment towers and office blocks would be best accomplished with rooftop gardens, says Alicia An, a professor of energy and environment at the City University of Hong Kong.

The balmy gardens would also reduce the tropical air temperature by around 1.3C nearby, reducing the energy needed to cool the building. At ground level, impervious concrete can be replaced by bioswales, ditches filled with native plants that naturally collect and filter rainwater. That water can then either be allowed to seep into the soil to replenish the groundwater or be collected in underground cisterns.     Construction of a drainage improvement project in the Chelsea neighbourhood of New York. Rather than drain into the sewage system, the project functions as a bioswale, diverting rainwater into the ground therefore not overflowing the wastewater treatment plants. Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy    In Los Angeles, Luthy is helping to develop a disused 50-acre rock quarry into a park-like facility that will capture stormwater, treat it to remove pollutants and then recharge the city\u2019s groundwater. The system should eventually be able to store more than a billion litres of water. \u201cThe idea is that you\u2019d put water into it year after year and then pump it out when you get into a drought,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ground becomes your savings bank for water.\u201d   Related: From Oregon to Johannesburg, micro-hydropower offers a solution for drought hit cities    In less-developed areas, controlling stormwater can mean more than just a stable water supply and a nice park. The World Resources Institute estimates that 21 million people worldwide are affected by river floods each year, a number that could rise to 54 million in 2030 due to climate change and socio-economic development. While digging bioswales can be a quick fix, transforming entire cities into sponges will require massive investment. Few buildings or municipalities have a \u201cgrey water\u201d infrastructure to transport fresh but untreated water like rainfall, and replacing kilometres of concrete or building massive underground cisterns (plus the smart systems to control them) is a pricey proposition. In a neighbourhood of east LA, for example, a single block known as Elmer Avenue with 24 homes has spent around $2.7m (\u00a31.78m) on a retrofit programme to harvest water, reducing flooding and enabling the city to bank water for future use.     Permeable concrete can help urban areas manage surface and storm water.   But the changes can make financial sense in the long term. When Changde, a city 1,200km west of Shanghai, replaced 15% of its hard-standing with bioswales, it cut its engineering bill for new drains in half. Sponge cities also come with wider social benefits, according to Luthy. \u201cAt nearly $50m, the LA quarry project is expensive but it gets support from lots of groups,\u201d he says. \u201cThe city likes it because it can provide water. Surfers like it because when you capture stormwater, you\u2019re preventing beach pollution. Environmental groups like it because you\u2019re greening the city and local residents like it because you\u2019re taking an urban blight and converting it to a community resource.\u201d  You can read our full \u2018water in cities\u2019 series here ", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Water", "Cities", "Urbanisation", "Environment", "Design", "Architecture", "Flooding", "Drought", "Engineering", "China", "Art and design", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Technology", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-01T12:23:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/03/jg-ballards-high-rise-takes-dystopian-science-fiction-to-a-new-level", "sentences": ["Thematically High-Rise follows on from Concrete Island with its typically Ballardian hypothesis: \u201cCan we overcome fear, hunger, isolation, and find the courage and cunning to defeat anything that the elements can throw at us?\u201d What links all of them is the exploration of gated communities, physical and psychological, a theme that is suggestive of Ballard\u2019s childhood experiences interned by the Japanese in a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Shanghai in the 1940s."], "title": "Why JG Ballard\u2019s High-Rise takes dystopian science fiction to a new level", "article": "JG Ballard\u2019s High-Rise, published 40 years ago and soon to be seen on cinema screens in a film adaptation directed by Ben Wheatley, begins with one of the most arresting first sentences in 20th-century literature: \u201cLater, as he sat on his balcony eating the dog, Dr Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months.\u201d   Related: Step into my evil modernist lair, Mr Bond: the best urban buildings in film    High-Rise is the final part of a quartet of novels \u2013 the first three are The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), Crash (1973) and Concrete Island (1974) \u2013 with each book seeded in the previous one. Thematically High-Rise follows on from Concrete Island with its typically Ballardian hypothesis: \u201cCan we overcome fear, hunger, isolation, and find the courage and cunning to defeat anything that the elements can throw at us?\u201d What links all of them is the exploration of gated communities, physical and psychological, a theme that is suggestive of Ballard\u2019s childhood experiences interned by the Japanese in a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Shanghai in the 1940s. It was, he always claimed, an experience he enjoyed. The built environment is not a backdrop, rather it is integral and distinctive in its recurring imagery \u2013 from abandoned runways, to curvilinear flyovers and those endlessly mysterious drained swimming pools. Perhaps more than any other writer, he focused on his characters\u2019 physical surroundings and the effects they had on their psyches. Ballard, who died in 2009, was also interested in the latent content of buildings, what they represented psychologically. Or, as he once obliquely put it, \u201cdoes the angle between two walls have a happy ending?\u201d \u2013 by which he meant that we project narrative on to external reality, that the imagination remakes the world. In Ballard\u2019s fiction, nothing is taken at face value. In High-Rise and Concrete Island especially, Ballard examines the flip side to what he called the \u201coverlit realm ruled by advertising and pseudo-events, science and pornography\u201d that The Atrocity Exhibition and Crash mapped out. Under-imagined or liminal spaces, such as multi-storey car parks and motorway flyovers, act as metaphors for the parts of ourselves that we ignore or are unaware of. His characters are often forced to assess the physical surroundings and, by extension, themselves rather than to take them for granted.         Chris Hall on Ballardian architecture    Ballardian space \u2013 what he called \u201cinner space\u201d to differentiate it from the science fiction that concerned itself with distant planets and space rockets \u2013 is in fact a fusion of inner and outer space. There is no \u201cout there\u201d totally separate from his characters; just as there is no exclusively private, isolated inner life. His most psychologically fulfilled characters look to transcend their physical surroundings, however hostile, by embracing them. The obsessive manner in which Ballard came to use the built environment in this way began with his short story \u201cThe Terminal Beach\u201d in 1964, in which a man called Traven finds himself on an abandoned atomic testing site on a Pacific atoll after his wife and young son have died in a car crash. The abstract lexicon in the story evokes a prison \u2013 there are mazes, blocks, bunkers, cells, corridors, aisles. His mind jumps from one fractured event to another in a kind of short circuit. Time becomes \u201cquantal\u201d just like the blocks on the island. There is no past, no future \u2013 just an endless, eventless present. He chooses to stay there with the ever intensifying hallucinations of his dead family rather than be rescued, and he hides from a search team when they come on to the island. Traven doesn\u2019t so much embrace his surroundings as become them. In Concrete Island, Ballard maroons the architect Robert Maitland, Crusoe-like, in a triangular interzone of a motorway intersection, armed only with \u201ca tool-kit, some architectural journals and six bottles of white Burgundy\u201d. The situation he finds himself trying to escape is an extended metaphor for Maitland\u2019s personal life, trapped in the dead space between himself, his wife and his mistress. Ballard kept repeating his mantra that \u201cIn a totally sane society, madness is the only freedom\u201d. In the chilling novella Running Wild (1988), set in a suburban gated community in Berkshire, the lives of the residents are a paralysing middle-class carousel of ordered sterility. Ballard details how this terminal boredom leads affectless children to kill their parents \u2013 and get away with it. In High-Rise, over the course of three months, a 40-storey tower block housing 2,000 residents \u2013 \u201ca small vertical city\u201d \u2013 descends from civilisation to tribalism to hunter-gatherer savagery (there is even a suggestion of cannibalism), in a kind of mass psychosis where they retreat from the outside world. Though Ballard was not a political writer in a narrow party sense, it can certainly be read as a premonition of the selfish Thatcherite society to come \u2013 a man-eat-dog society as well as a dog-eat-dog one. High-Rise has a clearly Freudian element to its three main protagonists. Richard Wilder (played in the film by Luke Evans) represents the id; Dr Robert Laing (clearly referring to RD Laing, the author of The Divided Self, and played by Tom Hiddleston) is the ego and the building\u2019s architect, Anthony Royal (Jeremy Irons), who lives in one of the penthouse apartments, is the super-ego. The tower block and the wider city are conceived of as living organisms, of having a consciousness of their own. \u201cLike a huge and aggressive malefactor, the high-rise was determined to inflict every conceivable hostility upon them.\u201d The calming lines of the rectilinear tower contrast with \u201cthe ragged skyline of the city\u201d which \u201cresembled the disturbed encephalograph of an unresolved mental crisis\u201d.     Ballard was inspired by Balfron Tower in east London. Photograph: Construction Photography/Alamy    At this psychodynamic level the residents actually enjoy the breakdown of the building\u2019s services, and the growing confrontation between the floors. But this is no class war \u2013 the residents are all middle-class professionals \u2013 it\u2019s territorial, atavistic. Defensible Space: People and Design in the Violent City (1972) by Oscar Newman, an American professor of urban planning, was a big influence on Ballard. Newman, like Jane Jacobs before him in The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), argued that urban violence can be mitigated by designs and layouts that exploit the natural surveillance of open spaces inside and outside buildings, something that high-rise buildings notably lack. There were many architectural inspirations for High-Rise \u2013 Le Corbusier\u2019s Cit\u00e9 Radieuse in Marseille, the Montparnasse tower in Paris \u2013 but the closest model is probably the brutalist Balfron tower in east London, not far from where Ballard puts his cluster of five tower blocks (more or less in present-day Canary Wharf). Its architect, Erno Goldfinger, like Royal, lived in one of the penthouse flats shortly after its completion but moved back home to Hampstead after only a few months. Not only did Goldfinger end up as the sinister Royal in High-Rise, but as an arch Bond villain \u2013 his Willow Road neighbour Ian Fleming objected to his modernist house, which was supposedly out of keeping with the street\u2019s Georgian housing. High-Rise\u2019s producer Jeremy Thomas had been trying to get the novel filmed for nearly 40 years. An early Paul Mayersberg script set it in the middle of the desert in Arizona, and a more recent adaptation for the director Vincenzo Natali had it located on a floating Burj Khalifa-like megatower \u2013 all of which, curiously, was to miss the central point that the building is mentally, rather than physically, cut off from the city; the structure turns its back on the metropolis by choice not circumstance. For film-makers it\u2019s a challenge to convey Ballardian space not only because of the technical difficulties in rendering \u201cinner space\u201d but also because all the author\u2019s fiction is in a sense set in the near future \u2013 what he called \u201cthe next five minutes\u201d. David Cronenberg\u2019s Crash (1997) has probably managed this best, successfully relocating the Westway, a dual carriageway in west London, to an anonymous Toronto. Encouragingly, Wheatley\u2019s new film, scripted by Amy Jump, is set in London in the 1970s (though filmed in Bangor, County Down) when the book is set. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment in design that looked to the future and was still excited about it,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we mainly see dystopia or a white, shiny iPod future. The idea of a book looking to a future that has already happened and making a film looking back to the past to show a possible future was interesting.\u201d     JG Ballard in 2004. Photograph: Barry Lewis/In Pictures/Corbis    The screenwriter and director Bruce Robinson, best known for The Killing Fields and Withnail &amp; I, really went to town on the Freudian view of High-Rise in his little-known 1979 script, which he subtitled An Analogy. \u201cI wrote it from the perspective of the building itself going insane,\u201d he says, \u201cwith the superego in the penthouses, the middle floors as the ego and the id in the underground car park. The brain of the building goes nuts. Architecturally, the thing that interested me was the pre-stressing technique with cables. As you put on each new floor, the weight and the stress on the cables gets more and more until by the final floor these cables are so stressed that the whole building has a monstrous concrete migraine \u2013 it just wants to explode anyway.\u201d Reading Robinson\u2019s script, it\u2019s interesting to see how the writer and director of Withnail &amp; I, with its brilliantly manic vernacular, has dealt with Ballard\u2019s rather measured, abstract tone. \u201cBallard was such an innovative and interesting writer but his prose style wasn\u2019t something I loved,\u201d explains Robinson. \u201cBut High-Rise is an amazing piece of work, an extraordinary story.\u201d In both Withnail &amp; I and High-Rise the characters must adapt to their harsh new surroundings. When the two main characters of Withnail go \u201con holiday by mistake\u201d, they arrive at Uncle Monty\u2019s cottage in the Lake District and have to improvise cooking a chicken without a roasting tray, propping it up astride a brick. There are moments of culinary ingenuity in Robinson\u2019s High-Rise, too, when Laing (here renamed Lovall) cooks his bacon by ironing it, and the guests at one of the decadent penthouse parties tuck into seagull and gin. These cloistered, self-enclosed environments such as the high-rise building were taken up again at the end of Ballard\u2019s career in another tetralogy of books: Cocaine Nights (1996), Super-Cannes (2000), Millennium People (2003) and his final work of fiction, Kingdom Come (2006). Here, Ballard looked at gated communities and the \u201cnerve tonic of violence\u201d that he claimed was needed in order to shock his characters out of the boredom brought about by consumer capitalism, where our most difficult moral decisions involve choosing which colour kettle to have. These leisure complexes, business parks and shopping malls were now not just self-enclosed but often fortified, too. Ballard argued that \u201cpeople aren\u2019t moving into gated communities simply to avoid muggers and housebreakers \u2013 they\u2019re moving in \u2026 to get away from other people. Even people like themselves.\u201d In this way, Ballardian environments actively select for psychopathic traits and it\u2019s the egocentric Laing who is best adapted to the high-rise who ultimately survives all the tower can throw at him. At the end of the novel he finds contentment as all the lights go out in another of the five towers, \u201cready to welcome them to their new world\u201d. \u2022 The UK premiere of High-Rise will be on 9 October as part of the BFI London film festival. bfi.org.uk", "tags": ["Fiction", "JG Ballard", "Film adaptations", "Film", "Books", "Culture", "High-Rise", "Architecture", "Luke Evans"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-03T10:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/05/youyou-tu-how-maos-challenge-to-malaria-pioneer-led-to-nobel-prize", "sentences": ["As news of Tu\u2019s victory reached her native land on Monday night, one fan wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter: \u201cRecognised at last!\u201d Tu was born in Ningbo, a port city about 140 miles south of Shanghai, in 1930."], "title": "Tu Youyou: how Mao\u2019s challenge to malaria pioneer led to Nobel prize", "article": "It was 21 January 1969 when Mao Zedong gave a 39-year-old scientist from Zhejiang province the challenge of her life.  China was in the grip of the Cultural Revolution, with universities and schools across the country shutting their doors as the red guards ran riot. Amid all the madness Tu Youyou, then a researcher at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, was handed a daunting mission: to find a drug that would cure malaria.   Related: William C Campbell, Satoshi \u014cmura and Youyou Tu win Nobel prize in medicine    \u201cThe work was the top priority so I was certainly willing to sacrifice my personal life,\u201d the famously understated scientist later recalled.

Yet for all her achievements, Tu, who is now 84, remains a little known figure, even in her native China where she had drifted into obscurity despite the magnitude of her discovery. As news of Tu\u2019s victory reached her native land on Monday night, one fan wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter: \u201cRecognised at last!\u201d Tu was born in Ningbo, a port city about 140 miles south of Shanghai, in 1930. She was named after a verse in the Book of Songs, a collection of ancient Chinese poetry that is believed to have been compiled by Confucius.     Tu working with Prof Lou Zhicen in the 1950s. Photograph: AP    Tu chose medicine, not philosophy, when she left Zhejiang and headed to China\u2019s capital to further her studies in 1951. She enrolled at the Peking University School of Medicine and graduated from its Department of Pharmacology four years later. From university Tu moved to the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She married Li Tingzhao, a former school classmate and factory worker with whom she would have two daughters, and settled down in Beijing.  Then, in 1969, everything changed when Tu was recruited to a medical research project so secret it was known only as \u201c523\u201d.            Watch the announcement: Who are the Nobel Prize for medicine winners?    The unit had been created two years earlier \u2013 on 23 May 1967 \u2013 on the orders of Chairman Mao, who hoped to find a way of halting the spread of malaria, a disease that was decimating North Vietnamese troops fighting in the jungles to China\u2019s south-west.  Tu was tasked with searching in nature for a new malaria treatment and was sent to Hainan, a tropical island off China\u2019s southern coast that has long struggled with its blight. There, in the sweltering rainforests of southern China, Tu witnessed up close the mosquito-borne disease\u2019s devastating toll on the human body. \u201cI saw a lot of children who were in the latest stages of malaria,\u201d she told New Scientist in 2011. \u201cThose kids died very quickly.\u201d     Tu was given the prestigious Lasker DeBakey clinical medical research award in 2011. Photograph: Wang Chengyun/Xinhua Press/Corbis    But it was in ancient Chinese manuscripts that Tu found the key to beating the disease. Back in Beijing, Tu and her team scoured books about traditional Chinese medicine for leads on substances that might help them defeat malaria. In a hundreds-of-years-old text, The Manual of Clinical Practice and Emergency Remedies by Ge Hong of the East Jin Dynasty, they found mention of sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) \u2013 or in Chinese qinghao \u2013 being used to treat malaria. Tu\u2019s team put it to the test. At first the results were mixed but after much persistence the researchers identified an active compound in the plant that attacked malaria-causing parasites in the blood and would later become known as artemisinin. Not content with identifying the remedy, which thus far had only been tested on animals, Tu took it upon herself to test it. \u201cAs the head of this research group, I had the responsibility,\u201d she said. The treatment worked and was proved safe for humans. Along with insecticide-treated bed nets, artemisinin became a crucial tool in the fight against malaria in Africa and Asia. Experts credit the discovery with saving millions of lives. Recognition came late in life to Tu, a famously modest woman who once remembered the moment of her discovery by saying: \u201cOf course that was a really happy moment in my career as a researcher.\u201d Only in 2011, when Tu was awarded the prestigious Lasker DeBakey clinical medical research award, did Communist party officials in her home town begin scrambling to locate and preserve the scientist\u2019s childhood home.

Other conference speeches had been straightforward. A few easy gags about the Labour leader, some gravelly bits about tough choices and the long-term economic plan and then \u2013 whoosh! \u2013 a rush of confident promises to zap the deficit and win the global race. The hall\u2019s menagerie of blue-rinses and sixth-formers in suits got the message: George Osborne \u2013 a man you can trust with your finances, even if not love with all your heart. But now what was he going to say?   Related: George Osborne\u2019s conference speech \u2013 the verdict | Tom Clark, Anne Perkins, Jonathan Freedland, Mariana Mazzucato and Matthew d\u2019Ancona    The chancellor glanced down at the A4 leaves, crawling with scribbles from his speechwriter and aides, and sighed. How different things had seemed just two years ago. Tory conference, autumn 2015: an election won, an economy humming, and him credited as the genius behind it all. Lobby hacks said he was the next prime minister. Lefty flacks thought he was parking tanks all over their parched little lawn. Westminster feared him; Beijing respected him. The world had hit Peak Osborne. Just then, when his stock had never been higher, things began to go wrong: indicators across the economic dashboard started to flash red. Oil prices kept falling, which he could live with as at least it shut the motorists up. But it wasn\u2019t just crude that was dropping, it was steel, nickel, zinc. Copper prices plunged to their lowest point since the banking meltdown. That really sent Treasury staff reeling: every mandarin knew that where copper went, the world economy tended to follow. Osborne mentally replayed the movie of those few weeks. Even by the tail-end of September, little of this was in front of the public. On Fleet Street, the City desks of the newspapers were getting jittery, while most of their colleagues went down to Brighton to poke fun at Jeremy Corbyn. But the week of Labour\u2019s conference was also the week that the old British Steel plant on Teesside \u2013 the second largest in Europe \u2013 got mothballed, leaving thousands out of a job. OK, so that was the north-east, and which self-respecting Tory even knew where that was? But then there was Glencore, once the 10th biggest company on the planet. About 70% had been wiped off the value of the mining group in just a few months. By the end of September it was fighting for its life. Osborne remembered the Monday one young adviser had run into his office with news that Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg had lost $500m of his personal fortune \u2013 in just one day\u2019s trading. That same day he heard the fateful phrase that would keep popping up over the next few months, \u201canother Lehman moment\u201d. Already that autumn the World Bank was panicking. The OECD was beside itself. Over at the International Monetary Fund, Osborne\u2019s old mate Christine Lagarde was warning that the global economy was heading into \u201cthe new mediocre\u201d. What was happening was simple. After the catastrophes of 2008-09, exhausted western leaders had relied on Asia and eastern Europe to pick up the baton and front-run the world economy. Financiers on Wall Street and Canary Wharf had gone pell-mell into these emerging markets, bearing billions in easy credit. Since 2010, the emerging markets had accounted for 80% of global growth, half of that coming from China alone. Now, after five boom years, the bubble was finally bursting and the fate of the world rested squarely in the hands of unelected technocrats, whether in Beijing or in central banks in Threadneedle Street, Frankfurt or Washington. Despite its avowals, China\u2019s communist leadership just couldn\u2019t work the same magic. In mid-October, when the politburo met to discuss the 13th five-year plan, its forecasts of 8% GDP growth were met with a sound never before heard from the economic policy-making community: the sniggering of deep scepticism. Britain was being sucked into what Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, called \u201cthe emerging markets crisis of 2015\u201d. In a speech in late September he\u2019d described how, in less than a decade, the world had lurched from crash to crash to crash: first in the US and UK, then Europe, and now Asia and other developing regions.     George Osborne arrives to deliver his keynote speech at the 2015 Conservative party conference. Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters    Once, what happened in Shanghai would have made little odds in the retail parks of Sheffield. But the post-crash world economy was much more tightly bound together. As Haldane pointed out, British-owned banks\u2019 exposure to greater China alone was worth $540bn. Soon, top-end bankers and property developers were murmuring in the chancellor\u2019s ear about how Russian oligarchs, whose fortunes had been underpinned by high commodity prices, were now liquidating their portfolios. It wasn\u2019t just stakes in British businesses that were being slung on to the market; handfuls of luxury homes in Kensington were suddenly up for sale. Just across Whitehall, Sajid Javid had nearly had his door knocked down by antsy vice-chancellors from half the Russell Group universities, fretting about huge drops in their lucrative foreign students \u2013 and massive holes in their balance sheets. For years, world leaders had relied on cheap credit to fuel growth in the west and then the east. The credit was still flowing, but the growth had slowed to a mere trickle. Osborne had tried something similar at home. His first two years in No 11 were full of promises of more exports and business investments. When by 2012 those unicorns hadn\u2019t turned up and David Cameron was in meltdown, Osborne\u2019s team resorted instead to pumping up the credit bubble. That meant shovelling money into the housing market. It also meant relying on the Bank of England to keep interest rates on the floor.   Related: George the Builder and the big Tory plan to fix Britain brick by brick    All that brought was the weakest recovery in the history of British capitalism \u2013 one that was also reliant on precarious loans rather than wages. Nearly 80% of car sales were made using showroom finance deals, up from around 50% in 2008; the massive spike in the buy-to-let market was reliant on interest-only mortgages. After Iceland\u2019s collapse, London had been dubbed Reykjavik-on-Thames for its dangerous reliance on lunatic house prices, massive credit and a huge finance sector. As this latest downturn deepened into 2016, it became clear how little Osborne had changed that. And unlike Alistair Darling in 2008 he had next to no ammo. The Labour government could at least run up a budget deficit, and count on Mervyn King to slash interest rates. With base rates at 0.5%, King\u2019s successor, Mark Carney, had no such wiggle room \u2013 while his austerity chancellor was too slow to pump up spending as his public finance targets were blow away. Osborne looked up towards windows letting in the watery morning light. Soon he\u2019d have to put the best gloss possible on all of this to conference. But who was that on the radio? Oh yes, his opposite number John McDonnell.

Related: BHP Billiton fined US$25m for gift trips to Beijing Olympics for foreign officials    Lisa Scaffidi was one of 60 dignitaries who accepted an invitation by BHP Billiton for an all-expenses-paid trip to the 2008 Games, of which the company was a sponsor. A further 116 people, including WA\u2019s premier, Colin Barnett, were invited but declined. In May this year the company was charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission with breaching the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for sponsoring foreign government officials to attend the event and agreed to pay a US$25m fine. The investigation of BHP Billiton\u2019s conduct prompted the Australian federal police to refer Scaffidi\u2019s involvement to WA\u2019s Corruption and Crime Commission. The CCC began its investigation in April and released a damning report on Monday, just two weeks before the 16 October mayoral election at which Scaffidi will be seeking to win her third straight four-year term. The report found that Scaffidi had been \u201cwrong\u201d to accept the invitation which, even excluding the costs of flights (which are not counted as a gift), was well above the City of Perth council\u2019s $300 cap on gifts where there was a reasonable belief that the donor was \u201cundertaking or intending to undertake an activity that requires council authorisation\u201d. It also found she had committed serious misconduct by failing to declare both the gift and the flights in her 2009 annual return or subsequently, and found that the \u201cdecision not to disclose was deliberate\u201d. The prospect of an invitation to the Olympics was mentioned to Scaffidi by Ian Fletcher, then the vice-president of external affairs for BHP Billiton, in February 2008, two days after she presided over a meeting to approve the City of Perth\u2019s new code of conduct for councillors. She ran the idea past the then City of Perth chief executive, Frank Edwards, and the pair decided it was not in breach of the council\u2019s rules because they did not know of any applications by the company before council. But by the time she received the official invitation, on 19 April 2008, council was considering an application by BHP Billiton to sponsor its Olympic Games Live event by letting it use the inner-city square Forrest Place to screen the games. That matter was approved by council on 22 April, with Scaffidi declaring an impartiality interest, and two days later she sent an email accepting the invitation. Scaffidi and her husband spent five days at the Olympics at the expense of BHP Billiton, before flying to Shanghai for a five-day holiday with, among other people, Fletcher. BHP Billiton paid for all the flights.  She was interviewed under oath by the CCC as part of its investigation, and, according to its report, \u201cgave no satisfactory explanation\u201d as to why it never occurred to her the trip could fall under the council\u2019s guidelines for a \u201cprohibited gift\u201d.   Related: West Australian government agencies spent $1m investigating own staff    When asked by the media about why she had not declared the trip, first by the Fairfax journalist Chris Thomson in 2009, and then by other journalists once news broke of BHP Billiton\u2019s drubbing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Scaffidi repeatedly said it had been a private trip and therefore did not have to be declared.  But in her CCC interview, the report said, Scaffidi was \u201cadamant that the offer was very much ambassadorial because of the extensive interests that [BHP Billiton] have in Western Australia\u201d. \u201cBecause of the number of inconsistent explanations that Mrs Scaffidi has proffered, the commission is unable to be satisfied that her motive and purpose for accepting the Olympic package was to advance the interests of the city,\u201d the report said.  \u201cIt is more probable than not Mrs Scaffidi became aware she should not accept, or alternatively should withdraw from, the trip but chose instead to avail herself of the opportunity of an all-expenses-paid trip to the Olympics followed by a side trip to Shanghai, where she paid for her own accommodation.\u201d Questioning why Scaffidi did not report the gift, despite being reminded to do so by Edwards and others, the report said: \u201cCamouflage could not have concealed the trip. Only non-disclosure might.\u201d The report also said she had committed serious misconduct for accepting and failing to declare another gift of three nights\u2019 accommodation for her and her husband at the Cable Beach Club Resort and Spa for the Broome Cup in August 2008. That trip was was paid for by a company called Hawaiian Investments, which was at that time part of a consortium aiming to develop a \u201cbusiness improvement district\u201d in Perth. A month before the Broome trip an application by the consortium for a $180,000 contribution to the district was put to the council. Scaffidi, who presided over that meeting, did not declare an impartiality interest and voted in favour, and the proposal was carried. The CCC also found serious misconduct in her failure to declare a third trip, again paid for by BHP Billiton, to see Chris Isaak perform at Leeuwin Estate, a winery in Margaret River, in March 2009, for which she received two nights\u2019 accommodation worth $490 and a meal worth $135. But the report said the CCC did not believe Scaffidi\u2019s conduct was corrupt. In a statement released late on Monday, Scaffidi said she was \u201crelieved\u201d the report had been published and she was \u201ctruly and deeply apologetic\u201d for failing to comply with reporting obligations. But she said she had been \u201centitled to rely on guidance offered by people far more serious than me in terms of governance\u201d. She rejected the finding that she had failed in her duty, saying: \u201cI never failed in my duties as lord mayor to the City of Perth in advancing all the capital city\u2019s interests.\u201d \u201cWould I do the same again?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe answer is absolutely.

The travel theme is an obvious one for the Parisian label. Lagerfeld, who travels by private jet, is a man of many time zones and he had clearly used his commute to work as inspiration.

Tuesday\u2019s played to the brand\u2019s customers who have the wallets to be of an international class, with passport control and upper class lounge access a part of their everyday lives. On the catwalk, the show opened with a pilot in a high-collared, double-breasted uniform wheeling his flight trolley through departures. Next came a model wearing a house tweed, retro cut trouser suit, which hinted at a time when air travel was glamorous.  Then the airport motifs came thick and fast. Cashmere jogging bottoms with a miniature plane print, departure board printed silks and tweed skirts that nodded to airline stewards\u2019 uniforms.

Tweed baseball caps, silver shoes, the layering of chiffon dresses over slouchy trousers and knitted ribbed trouser suits felt perfect for the modern street style look, as seen on the Instagram feeds of fashion\u2019s elite. The chunky sandals whose soles featured flight path lights and the padded wheelie carry-on suitcases were guaranteed commercial gold.

But, despite the current gloom, innovation still stands strong. Regularly unique, sometimes surprising, often completely different to anything you\u2019ve seen in the west, China\u2019s approach to marketing and social media has been an incredible journey over the last few years. We\u2019ve been following this progress closely, with the team in our Shanghai office, and we\u2019ve recently published a report into the digital, social and mobile landscape in China.  There were some big numbers in there, with the headline stats focused predominantly on mobile and social growth. There are now 574 million mobile social media users in China, up 15 million since this time last year, as well as the fact that there are now 659 million social media users \u2013 more than the US and Europe combined. But what does all this tell marketers about China, and how to approach it? Here are the five key points to consider when communicating with a Chinese audience.   Related: Luxury brands must redefine the way they do business    1. China is different It\u2019s obvious that the platforms that dominate in China are markedly different to ones that marketers are familiar with elsewhere \u2013 even those in their Asian neighbours. However, it\u2019s not just the platforms that are different; the ways that Chinese netizens use social channels is also markedly different, and marketers need to carefully adapt their approaches for China\u2019s cultural and societal idiosyncrasies as much as for its technological differences. One size does not fit all when it comes to China. 2. A personal approach makes a difference In particular, the growing popularity of chat apps in China presents a new set of opportunities for marketers. Many of the conversations that take place on these platforms are more private in nature, taking place between individuals and small groups (versus the public environments that western marketers will know from Facebook and Twitter).  In order to take advantage of the intimate nature of these one-to-one conversations, marketers will need to explore new approaches to social media and content marketing, ensuring that the tactics they employ make it easy for audiences to find and consume content on one platform (eg video-sharing services like Youku or Tudou), and then share that content via chat apps. This will require greater emphasis on highly engaging content and organic sharing, rather than an approach that relies on paid media to push mediocre content to the masses. 3. Get to know the calendar While western marketers gear up for the big pre-Christmas shopping days of the year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday at the end of November, the big dates in the Chinese calendar happen at different times. Singles\u2019 Day, a shopping festival that also happens in November, targets people who are single (as you might have guessed) and offers them an excuse to buy themselves gifts in celebration of their single status.  It\u2019s already become hugely popular among young Chinese people, and is now the country\u2019s largest shopping day of the year, despite the fact that it\u2019s not a cultural tradition, but the recent commercial brainchild of e-commerce giant Alibaba. Sales on Alibaba\u2019s various sites exceeded $9.3bn (\u00a35.85bn) in just one day last on Singles\u2019 Day last year, and there\u2019s every chance that number will pass $10 billion on 11 November this year.  Retailers start marketing Singles\u2019 Day at least a month before the day, and on the day itself, offer big discounts (sometimes up to 50%) on products to draw consumers in. Think of it as a bit like a Boxing Day shopping mentality, but without the hangover and leftover turkey. Meanwhile, lunar new year is another big commercial festival in China, and inspires the sort of commercial activity that western marketers would associate with Christmas. 4. Social selling As with any market, peer-to-peer recommendations are the holy grail of marketing, and China is no different in this respect. Indeed, given the highly regulated nature of the country\u2019s more traditional mass media, word-of-mouth is even more critical in China \u2013 a fact supported by McKinsey research.  For this reason, recommendations both offline and on social networks such as WeChat, QQ and Sina Weibo have become \u201cthe most important factor in the online shopping decision,\u201d according to another McKinsey report featured in China Daily.  Given this behaviour, marketers must start to explore how the dynamics of social referral work in China for their specific audiences and industry, and use that to move from social engagement to social conversion. 5. QR codes are critical In addition to general online purchases, one trend that our report picked up on is the willingness to buy products on mobile \u2013 20% bought a product on a mobile device over a month (2% higher than the UK and US), with 15% claiming to have researched a product to buy on their phone. M-commerce is clearly big but what are retailers doing to help spur this along?  Despite their poor standing in the minds of many western marketers, the QR code is a daily essential for brands in China, and the distinctive black and white images can be found on billboards and products all over the country. This is partly thanks to WeChat\u2019s adoption \u2013 using a QR code and a WeChat wallet, consumers can buy goods from physical stores in China instead of using cash or a credit card. This year, Alibaba launched \u201cdotless visual codes\u201d for brands to place on product packaging so that consumers can use their phone to check a product\u2019s authenticity and get information, discounts and recommendations based on their preferences. Just because something is out of fashion in the west, don\u2019t assume the same is true for China.

It\u2019s no surprise to learn that living in a city \u2013 any city \u2013 is generally more stressful than life in a rural idyll. But neuroscientist Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg and his team at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim, Germany, are trying to get to the root of what makes the city environment so stressful. In 2011, they published a study in the journal Nature showing that, compared to people who live in the countryside, city-dwellers are hyperactive in a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is linked to depression and anxiety.

Photograph: Tim Graham/Getty Images    Now, they\u2019re using the same technique \u2013 based on scanning people\u2019s brains while they stress out over mental arithmetic \u2013 in a larger, follow-up study. \u201cWe know now that cities as a whole are causal, but of course we need to work out which aspects of the city are causal,\u201d says Meyer-Lindenberg. \u201cSo we are using that approach to look at individual components of city risk, which might range from toxins, to noise, to lead pollution, to social factors.\u201d While their work focuses on European cities, Meyer-Lindenberg says these may be less interesting examples than some of China or Brazil\u2019s rapidly developing megacities, which are still in the midst of the urbanisation process. Take Shanghai, for instance. Quite aside from the worrying prospect of dying of overwork, there\u2019s the sheer density of people, housing and traffic to contend with. The Shanghai urban area is home to more than 23 million people: 119,000 per sq mile in the inner city, way above that of Paris or Manhattan. Space on the roads is at such a premium that the government has introduced a lottery-style system for issuing a restricted number of new licence plates each month.  The link between population density and health is not new. Early in the 20th century, planners and public health officials established what they determined to be a healthy housing density of around 12 units per acre. Rebecca Miles, a planning researcher at Florida State University, dug up this figure in a document from the late 1900s. The numbers can be debated, but Miles agrees there\u2019s a balance to be had between creating lively, social communities and being so close to your neighbours that it becomes unpleasant. What planners back then didn\u2019t factor in, however, was the exponential growth of the motor car. In 1900, there were only 8,000 registered motor vehicles in the United States. By 1950, there were more than 49 million, and 40 million of these were cars. Today, traffic density may be just as much to blame for stress as people density. But is there any evidence linking traffic to stress?     Cairo is considered to be one of the noisiest cities in the world.

It showed that people living in parts of the city with higher traffic volumes had more symptoms of depression. \u201cSo it\u2019s the density in conjunction with the traffic volume,\u201d says Miles, noting that the study also supported the theory that green space alleviates stress and depression. \u201cI think the benefit of the kind of work we did and that others are doing is to draw attention to these factors, recognising that density and traffic volumes have mental health impacts as well as in some cases physical health impacts.\u201d The Miami study used traffic volumes as a proxy for traffic noise, a well-recognised source of stress in the urban environment. Recent research in the Dutch city of Maastricht, for example, found that residents in neighbourhoods exposed to more traffic and railway noise reported being in a worse state of mental health. Underlying the link between noise and health is the \u201cgeneral stress model\u201d, which suggests that noise activates the nervous system, as well as stress hormones, and raises blood pressure. It also contributes to poor quality sleep \u2013 a risk factor for depression and anxiety. Cairo is considered to be one of the noisiest cities in the world. Its bad reputation, says Daniel Pope, a noise specialist for the UK-based engineering firm Atkins, is down to very narrow streets bordered by tall buildings, which create corridors of noise. The difficulty with trying to align noise and stress levels, however, is that what annoys one person won\u2019t necessarily annoy another. \u201cIt is very subjective,\u201d Pope says. \u201cSome people who live in a city may go out to the countryside and find that all the animal sounds disturb them. Some people might come into the city and find that every car that passes by at night disturbs them. There\u2019s a very large factor of what you\u2019re used to.\u201d    Early in the 20th century, public health officials determined a healthy housing density to be 12 units per acre       Flooding is a common inconvenience in Miami, which ranks 7th in one list of America\u2019s most stressed-out cities. Photograph: Stringer/Reuters/Corbis    It\u2019s not just the noise though. It\u2019s the noise, the commuting times and even, potentially, the particulate matter, a component of vehicle emissions that was recently linked to anxiety. Cairene taxi drivers sit right at the centre of all of this. Add to that a population density only just shy of Shanghai\u2019s and it\u2019s hardly surprising if \u201cthe mother of the world\u201d is a little stressed out. Hardly surprising \u2013 but as with any megacity, there are still stark differences in stress levels depending on who you are, and which neighbourhood you inhabit there. Take Mumbai, where each person has less than five sq m to call their own. For Carlin Carr, an American working on urban poverty issues there, it\u2019s a city of contradictions, where the stresses exist on a deeper level than just having to sit in traffic. \u201cMumbai forces you to witness the raw fight for survival every day,\u201d says Carr. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching to see a mother begging for food to feed her child, and rag-pickers sorting heaps of trash for a few rupees. These stresses are born out of the massive inequality in the city and the major lack of resources to provide Mumbaikars with the most basic of needs. Yet, despite this, I think it\u2019s true to say that Mumbai can be free of many of the stresses of normal urban life.\u201d  Carr is referring to the many Mumbaikars who hire cooks, cleaners, childminders and chauffeurs to relieve themselves of many of life\u2019s daily stresses. Money can indeed go a long way to circumvent the stress of cities: it\u2019s often the most deprived neighbourhoods that are located near major roads, railway lines and airports, either because those on lower incomes can\u2019t afford to move away or because to live cheaply in the city, they have no choice but to move there. The same pattern is seen around the world, from Paris to Hong Kong.     In Mumbai, the average person has less than five sq m to call their own.  Photograph: Alamy    When it comes to planning, it\u2019s usually the more obvious stresses that are addressed first. Common suggestions for ways to take the stress out of the urban environment are encouraging active travel, building better public transport systems and improving access to green space. Green space is one that gets mentioned a lot, because there\u2019s good evidence for links to mental health, as supported by Miles\u2019s study on depression in Miami. \u201cExposure to greenery is positive for mental health, as well as being active in it,\u201d says Miles. \u201cThat\u2019s an important distinction to make, because there\u2019s a lot of discussion of the benefits of physical activity, but even exposure to greenery is very good for mental health.\u201d London, by some estimates, comprises 47% green space. The trouble is that deprived neighbourhoods tend to have limited access to these spaces \u2013 a problem highlighted in the 2010 Marmot Review, which addressed health inequalities across England. The review recommended ensuring access to good quality green spaces right across the social gradient. Perhaps there are cities we can look to as shining examples: stress-free cities that prioritise the mental health of their citizens? There are very few, says Victoria Pinonc\u00e9ly, a researcher at the Royal Town Planning Institute, but she proposes Bogot\u00e1 in Colombia as an example of a major city that is at least attempting to make itself more liveable.   Related: Sick cities: why urban living can be bad for your mental health    With a population of around eight million and rising, Bogot\u00e1 hasn\u2019t yet reached the ranks of megacity \u2013 but others, including Mexico City and Guangzhou, do have designs on its transport system. Its 350km of CicloRuta (bike paths) and TransMilenio (rapid bus system) make for a more pleasant travel experience than in other expanding cities. Examples of good planning can also be found closer to home, too, Pinonc\u00e9ly says, albeit on a smaller scale. \u201cIn Bradford town centre, there\u2019s this public space called City Park, which provides a place where you can socialise and relax, and where there\u2019s no car traffic. That\u2019s the kind of initiative that I think would be promoting better mental health and stress relief.\u201d In the developing world, however, there are not the same resources to devote to mental health and, as Pinonc\u00e9ly points out, a lack of data means the true impacts of traffic, overcrowding and poor housing conditions simply aren\u2019t known. In Cairo, gleaming tower blocks on one side of the road reflect the dusty jumble of informal settlements on the other. It is clear that stress comes in many forms. There\u2019s the type you\u2019ll experience by sitting in a traffic jam for three hours, and the type that comes with surviving on a meagre wage. Taxi-driving doesn\u2019t earn you a decent living in this city, so many cabbies are unfortunate enough to experience both. Hayley Birch writes about science and the environment from Bristol, UK.

With London copper prices edging lower and a broker downgrade of its price target adding to the pressure, the company is currently down 1.45p to 122.55p. Its shares have lost more than half of their value this year on concerns about its borrowings, although a statement last week from the company designed to ease these worries has seen them edge off their lowest levels. Canaccord Genuity has kept its speculative buy rating on the business but cut its target price from 220p to 190p to reflect lower commodity prices. It said:  Even after removing readily marketable inventories from net debt, Glencore carries mid- year net debt of US$29.6bn, significantly more than any of its FTSE 100 mining peers. However, a review of statements from Moody\u2019s and S&amp;P demonstrates that the ratings agencies are comfortable leaving Glencore\u2019s investment grade ratings unchanged at BBB/Baa2, particularly given the 7 September announcement. Both agencies have moved to a negative outlook, which seems sensible given the impact on cashflows should commodity prices fall demonstrably lower on a sustained basis. While both agencies note that Glencore will be outside the preferred guidelines for its credit rating they see this as a temporary (around 6-18-month) issue. In its funding factsheet, released 6 October, Glencore outlined the limited impact of a credit rating downgrade. Given our lower commodity price assumptions, we reduce our target price from 220p to 190p. However, this still leaves upside of over 50% to our target price, and we remain positive on the stock, retaining our Speculative Buy recommendation. There are clearly still potential risks should commodity prices decline further but we believe that the shares have been oversold on debt concerns. Certainly, the ratings agencies don\u2019t seem to be as troubled as some in the equity market; investors should take note of that.   Apart from Glencore other miners are mixed, with Fresnillo up 15.5p at 691.5p after HSBC raised its target price from 760p to 810p. BHP Billiton is 12p better at \u00a311.20 but Anglo American is down 6.6p at 657.9p. Overall the FTSE 100 has edged lower after its recent gains, down 14.31 points at 6322.04. Investors are cautious ahead of a raft of central bank news, with a rate decision from the Bank of England and minutes from the Bank, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. At the same time, poor export figures from Germany have revived fears about the eurozone economy, although this also points to further possible stimulus measures from the ECB. In China the Shanghai composite ended 3% higher after a holiday break. Among the FTSE 100 fallers are a number of companies whose shares have gone ex-dividend.

Except the unassuming Diego Magdaleno would rather not carry the handle that the business has lumbered him with. He is good enough without it, as Terry Flanagan will discover when making the first defence of his WBO lightweight title. Not that the American is above talking about himself in the third person, because that is what boxers do. \u201cCome Saturday, the UK fans are going to love what they see from Diego Magdaleno,\u201d the Las Vegas visitor said this week. \u201cI guarantee to bring a lot of excitement, fire, heat, explosiveness. Plus, I\u2019m an artful boxer. \u201cTerry Flanagan seems a stand-up guy. He knows how to box, use his reach, move his feet. He has many good qualities. But I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s fought a guy of my stature before. I\u2019ll be bringing something different.\u201d What he brings besides a 28-1 record and eight years of knowledge is one of the best trainers in the business, Joel Diaz, renowned for his work with the world-class operators Tim Bradley, Abner Mares and Omar Figueroa. Flanagan-Magdaleno is a quality headliner on a strong BoxNation card and the unbeaten Mancunian champion will need all the help a home crowd can deliver to hang on to the title he won on a second-round injury retirement against Jose Zepeda in July. The undefeated Liverpudlian Liam \u201cBeefy\u201d Smith contests the vacant WBO light-middleweight title with the Apollo Kid, known to his mother as John Thompson, of Newark, New Jersey, and owner of a 6ft 1in frame and 17-1 record. That defeat was a clean knockout in the second of eight rounds in January last year, delivered by a right hook from Frank \u201cNotorious\u201d Galarza, an unbeaten 30-year-old New Yorker with no great names on his record. That should give Smith encouragement. Of the other bouts, the stylist and former Olympian Thomas Stalker and Welshman Craig Evans \u2013 who gave Scott Cardle a decent argument over 12 rounds in his last fight \u2013 should provide the best entertainment fighting for the vacant WBO European lightweight belt. Indeed it is a busy weekend everywhere. A trawl through the global calendar might be an eye-opener for the uninitiated or outright hostile but confirmation for the committed that the rough old business is ticking along quite nicely. On Saturday night alone, from Shanghai to Buenos Aires, from Riga to Managua, and a score of points in between, filling small halls, back rooms and stadiums, there will be an estimated 156 bouts of varying quality. Quite a few of the willing coves will box for money that will barely cover their expenses; 17 bouts will have titles attached to them. Among the dross there is a diamond or two. An interesting clash is that between Jorge Linares \u2013 who kept his WBO world lightweight title with a brutal stoppage of Kevin Mitchell in May \u2013 and the moderate Mexican Ivan Cano in Caracas. If a challenger who has drawn twice and lost twice in his last six outings is worth a title shot, surely Mitchell can earn another go at Linares, because theirs was one of the fights of the year. Further down the road, speculation this week that Amir Khan is going to be Manny Pacquiao\u2019s next and probably last opponent before the Congressman gets serious about his politics, needs firming up. Khan deserves the fight after the disappointment of missing out on a shot at Floyd Mayweather (and there is not a good judge in the business who would deny the Bolton fighter would have been a worthier opponent for the champion than was Andre Berto). But, remarkably, Mayweather now seems to be holding out slim hope to Pacquiao that they can do a rematch of their disappointing but hugely rich fight of last May. The Filipino told reporters in Doha this week he was not ruling it out but the odds are he will be as disappointed as was Khan.", "tags": ["Boxing", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-09T12:19:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/09/orhan-pamuk-interview-a-strangeness-in-my-mind", "sentences": ["It would be cruel and selfish if only my buildings should be around.\u201d Flying into Istanbul \u2013 seeing the clusters of apartment buildings spreading like sea foam over the land, the impression is less of an old imperial capital than an emerging 21st-century powerhouse \u2013 a Shanghai, or S\u00e3o Paulo."], "title": "Orhan Pamuk: \u2018It\u2019s impossible to avoid politics \u2026 sometimes I don\u2019t know how\u00a0to shut my mouth\u2019\r\n", "article": "From my hotel room in the centre of Istanbul, where I have come to interview Turkey\u2019s best-known novelist, Orhan Pamuk, I look out at a huge, gaping hole. The opposite side of it forms a cliff perhaps 50 metres high. At the top is a row of slender town houses, built to accommodate poor Christian families in the mid-19th century. They teeter on the brink, their scale and form a world away from the shopping mall planned for the vast space beneath. Lacking the kind of planning restrictions that make London\u2019s growth seem sclerotic by comparison, Istanbul is changing at breakneck speed. The historic core is more or less sacrosanct: Hagia Sophia, the Topkap\u0131 palace and grand mosques nearby will not be overshadowed. But towers sprout everywhere else. Skyscrapers and blocks of flats swell over hillsides, a curtain of transmitters forms the backdrop to the Bosphorus and building works fill the air with juddering noise. It is this shape-shifting city, not the sublime Ottoman capital of his murder mystery My Name Is Red, that provides the setting for Pamuk\u2019s latest book, his eighth novel to be translated into English. A Strangeness in My Mind, six years in the writing, spans 44 in the life of a street vendor, Mevlut. A village boy from southern Anatolia, he arrives in Istanbul towards the end of the 60s to help his yoghurt-seller father. They live in a slum house and watch neighbourhoods sprout and change around them. Some get lucky in the great property game that preoccupies Istanbulites as much as it does the residents of other metropolises; not Mevlut. He fails to trade up, renting an apartment while his cousins grow rich working for the local real-estate mogul. As well as falling deeply in love with the woman he marries (despite the match being a convoluted case of mistaken identity), he becomes enthralled by his new home. For decades, he roams its boulevards and alleyways, selling ice-cream, chicken and rice, and finally, boza. He keeps faith with this old-fashioned fermented drink even as his customers dwindle to those who fancy a glass of nostalgia with their evening meal. Born into a wealthy family in 1952, Pamuk was educated at Istanbul\u2019s elite American school, Robert College, and initially set his heart on becoming a painter. He went on to study architecture, but dropped out in his early 20s, deciding to write instead. \u201cI am happier when I paint and draw, but I definitely feel more intelligent when I write,\u201d he tells me. His otherwise quite bare apartment (like the ones on the floors above and below, which he also owns), is filled with the books he has accumulated in the years since. On the wall next to his desk, from which he enjoys a stupendous view of the Bosphorus and the Topkap\u0131, is posted a cryptic handwritten note: \u201cI am only writing for that person who thinks that I am only writing for that person.\u201d     Istanbul, with the Bosphoros in the distance. Photograph: WestEnd61/Rex    Whatever this means, his portrait of Mevlut has an utterly convincing, even documentary feel. (Pamuk also has the ability to make the banal compelling \u2013 a description of the intricacies of electricity-meter reading, for example, keeps the reader entertained for far longer than it has any right to.) Yet the social gulf between the author and his protagonist is enormous. \u201cIt\u2019s not my life,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s a life that I have seen from my childhood home, very close by. Shanty towns here are not as in, say, Rio de Janeiro, separated by clear lines from the town. When immigration to Istanbul started in the 50s and 60s, there was much empty land inside the town, on which people built their own houses.\u201d Even so, he conducted extensive research. \u201cReading books doesn\u2019t help much, but talking to people with a recorder \u2013 I did this endlessly.\u201d The goodwill he encountered on the streets helped him along. \u201cBoza sellers are still around in Istanbul. You buy boza and then you have a conversation and you say, \u2018I\u2019m actually so-and-so and thinking of a novel, would you like to talk?\u2019 And people talk.\u201d He was invited into their homes, talking to the women who came to the city from villages with their husbands and nothing else. He quizzed waiters, men who sold rice and chicken, fried liver and stuffed mussels. The authenticity of the book comes from these conversations. But is it right that a rich, westernised man should tell the stories of Istanbul\u2019s poor? Pamuk is clear on this point: \u201cIf being a novelist has any moral, political side, it is identifying with people who are not like you. It\u2019s not that we make political statements or show our party cards; it\u2019s seeing the world through the eyes of someone who is different.\u201d This is one part of the duty of being a writer, he explains. Another is the need to examine unflinchingly one\u2019s own experiences. He told an interviewer in 2005 that Istanbul: Memories and the City, an account of his early life, rich in family incident, \u201cdestroyed my relationship with my mother \u2013 we don\u2019t see each other any more\u201d. I ask if the estrangement is ongoing. \u201cNo, we made up. In fact, I\u2019m going to see her tonight!\u201d That\u2019s good news, I say. \u201cShe was angry, but then it\u2019s the eternal problem of the writer \u2013 telling the intimate truth. It begins with your partner, then it goes to your family, then it goes to your nation,\u201d he says. \u201cI accept the burden.\u201d But all this emotional trawling has a practical application, too: \u201cIntimate detail most of the time equals convincing detail.\u201d But will the immense detail of Mevlut\u2019s story, which has sold 230,000 copies in Turkey after only nine months (prompting commentators to wonder whether boza sales will also shoot up), grip readers elsewhere? He tells me that, at gatherings of his editors and translators, \u201cI would ask exactly the same question. I would shyly say, \u2018this is a bit of a Turkish story.\u2019 And the Spanish answer to that was, \u2018Well, my mother\u2019s kitchen was exactly like this.\u2019 The Italian answer, \u2018This is just like people from the south, from Sicily, moving to Milan.\u2019 Maybe they were being kind.\u201d But the site-specific nature of Pamuk\u2019s work has never limited his appeal in the past: he tells me that international sales are usually between five and eight times the Turkish total. His next project is \u201ca novel of ideas\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m working on a short book, but my short books end up being 250 pages,\u201d he jokes. What\u2019s it about? \u201cYou know in the Shahnameh\u201d \u2013 a Persian epic \u2013 \u201cthere is the story of Rostam and Sohrab, the father killing the child. And then there is this famous Oedipus of Sophocles, the son killing the father. I\u2019m writing a short, in a way experimental, novel about these ideas.\u201d So it\u2019s a murder story? \u201cYes,\u201d he says hesitantly, \u201cbut let\u2019s talk about it when it\u2019s published!\u201d     Orhan Pamuk receives the Nobel prize for literature from King Carl Gustaf of Sweden in 2006. Photograph: Henrik Montgomery/EPA    In 2005, Pamuk was prosecuted for insulting Turkishness after an interview in which he raised the killings of Armenians and Kurds. The quote in question was first published in a Swiss magazine (under Article 301 of the penal code as it stood at the time, the crime of denigrating Turkishness was deemed more serious if committed by a Turkish citizen abroad). Unbowed, he repeated the comments at a lecture in Germany. Charges against him were dropped in 2006. Later that year, he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature: the committee stated that \u201cin the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city he has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures.\u201d Recalling the episode now, he says: \u201cI expend extra effort not to have feelings of anger. I may have troubled times, I still have a bodyguard, I still sometimes feel pressured. But the fact is that I am a happy man.\u201d His bodyguard is provided by the Turkish state, and I ask him who he thinks his enemies are now, particularly given that his books don\u2019t obviously bang the drum for either side in the great debate over secularism and the role of Islam. \u201cThe guy who would attack you in the street is not the guy who reads your novel,\u201d he tells me. And then, a convivial warning: \u201cHe only reads the tabloid representation of what you say to a Guardian interviewer. So the journalist in London will change it a bit, then the editor would add a bit of spice and sugar, and the tabloid would pick it up.\u201d \u201cAll the troubles I had were not because of my books but because of Turkey\u2019s problems. In fact, my political problems came with the fact that I was getting translated into many languages ... And then sometimes \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say most of the time \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to shut my mouth. And also, you get angry, you want to tell the truth, you don\u2019t want to do a little bit of a circling around the problem.\u201d In any case, he says, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to avoid politics and be a famous Turkish writer, even if you only write about roses and butterflies.\u201d Changes in the law since 2008 mean it is now harder to prosecute someone for denigrating Turkishness. The question of what the nation\u2019s essential qualities are, however, remains far from settled. Pamuk is clear on one thing: it doesn\u2019t reside in the Ottoman empire, a world that he wrote about so gorgeously in My Name is Red and The White Castle, and the epicentre of which we can see from his desk. \u201cI sometimes say that I\u2019m the only historical novelist in the world who writes his novel and can point out where the action takes place,\u201d he jokes. The idea of the good old Ottoman years as some kind of a model for contemporary Turkey has arisen recently, he argues, under the current Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. But to equate Turkishness with the empire is false \u2013 back then Turks were, at most, a ruling Muslim elite. Society was extremely plural, and economic and military interests were spread far and wide. \u201cOttoman rhetoric\u201d is, Pamuk says, a function of the country\u2019s economic growth, and its ability to look outwards once more. But \u201cit\u2019s not realistic; it\u2019s not down to earth\u201d. He believes that if Turkey has energy for reform, it should be directed inwards, at human rights, the question of free speech and respect for minorities. Is it Istanbul, then, that holds the secret to Turkishness? I wonder whether, as with New York and London, the great city has relatively little in common with the rest of the country. When I ask what the capital Ankara is like, he quotes the poet Yahya Kemal Beyatl\u0131: \u201cThe best thing about Ankara is the way back to Istanbul.\u201d It is this city, he says, that\u2019s the real capital. \u201cI\u2019ve been living here 63 years, so for me it\u2019s the capital of the world in a way.\u201d And, indeed, \u201cmost of the meaning of Turkishness is also invented here\u201d. What about the pace of change, the kind of reconstruction that leaves Mevlut bewildered, and me staring in wonder at the abyss outside my hotel. \u201cWhen I was born here, it was a city of a million, and all the hills that we see from here, there were no buildings there, they were sometimes empty, sometimes woods. All of this has been destroyed. Another 14 million came to live here. I feel extremely privileged to have been a sort of storyteller of these people. I belong to them. But on the other hand [there has been] immense change.\u201d He says that the past 13 years easily eclipsed the previous 50 in terms of development. Is the heritage of the city being put at risk? \u201cI worried about that and it got political in the Gezi uprising. But I do my best to balance it \u2013 \u2018Orhan, remember that 14 million were added to your city\u2019. It would be cruel and selfish if only my buildings should be around.\u201d Flying into Istanbul \u2013 seeing the clusters of apartment buildings spreading like sea foam over the land, the impression is less of an old imperial capital than an emerging 21st-century powerhouse \u2013 a Shanghai, or S\u00e3o Paulo. I tell Pamuk that, if asked to name a global city, westerners would be unlikely to mention his home \u2013 and that this is probably now an error.

Beijing has also been intensively courted by George Osborne on his recent visit to China to invest in new UK nuclear power stations, bid for HS2 rail supply contracts and connect the London and Shanghai stock exchanges. \u201cIt is an informal approach,\u201d one well-placed source told Reuters about the LME move, while a second source talked about the metal exchange making \u201cstrong overtures\u201d to the Baltic, which is owned by its shipbroker members.   Related: Worse things still happen at sea: the shipping disasters we never hear about    Jeremy Penn, chief executive of the Baltic, declined to comment on any takeover talks but said no conclusion should be drawn from that. \u201cWe would never comment in any way on anything of that nature whether it was true or untrue.\u201d The Baltic, whose historic building was bombed by the IRA in 1992, is well past its prime as a vital location for ships to be chartered. Today it is largely useful for producing benchmark data such as the Baltic Dry Index, which tracks the rates for hiring bulk carriers of iron ore, grain or coal. But the institution retains City cachet and has been previously courted by the LME, itself the oldest and largest market for trading industrial metals such as steel, copper or zinc. The Baltic has also recently moved into the black after a period of losses. In September, it unveiled plans to pay out almost \u00a310m in dividends to its 380 shareholders. Penn has recently announced plans to step down from his role in 2016, having completed more than a decade in his post. The LME, which says it allows producers and consumers of metal to hedge their risks against fluctuating commodity prices, was bought by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in 2012 for nearly \u00a31.4bn.  The Chinese company regulates stock market trading rules in Hong Kong, where it is based. It is also a joint venture partner with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in an organisation which aims to \u201ccontribute to the further internationalisation of China\u2019s capital markets\u201d.", "tags": ["Financial sector", "Chinese economy", "Business", "Water transport", "Commodities"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-09T16:43:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/10/the-agenda-laura-trott-bradley-wiggins-european-cycling-championships", "sentences": ["Related: Katy Marchant taking the fast route to Great Britain squad for Rio Olympics    SERVING GIANTS \u2026 Another tournament with a youthful complexion is the ATP Shanghai Rolex Masters, which starts on Sunday."], "title": "The Agenda: Laura Trott and Bradley Wiggins on track in European Championships", "article": "FAST BIKERS \u2026 Grenchen hosts Europe\u2019s two-wheel track stars as the European Track Cycling Championships gets under way on Wednesday.

He pasted things illegally in the street. Did you have a revelation at some stage, I ask him, when you thought, \u201cAh, this is art\u201d? \u201cNo. At the time, there was not street art,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was no Banksy. It\u2019s not the kind of thing you said you wanted to be when you\u2019re older.\u201d What? A criminal? \u201cExactly.\u201d JR still pastes things in the street; it\u2019s just that the things have got bigger. And the world has an expanded idea of what\u2019s vandalism and what\u2019s art. JR\u2019s canvases are now tower blocks, whole buildings, entire streets. His scale is epic, monumental. He turned the separation wall between Israel and Palestine into a giant gallery of faces \u2013 Palestinians on the Israeli side, Israelis on the Palestinian side, though no one could tell. He transformed a huge favela in Brazil into a vast artwork in which he literally gave the town eyes, and he displayed a pregnant refugee on the point of giving birth on half a mile of the Seine embankment in the solidly bourgeois Ile Saint-Louis.     As part of his Women are Heroes series, JR pasted this image of a pregnant refugee on half a mile of the Seine embankment in the bourgeois Ile Saint-Louis, 2009. Photograph: JR/LePhot    He\u2019s usually described as a street artist and given that he\u2019s from Paris, and started out spray-painting walls and has the semi-anonymity of those two initials (his real name has never been made public), \u201cthe French Banksy\u201d is a description that tends to follow him around. But whereas Banksy is furtive, stealthy, inward, JR couldn\u2019t be more expansive. He works with a large team of people across two continents, collaborates constantly, and communicates \u2013 via Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and the walls of dozens of cities around the world \u2013 relentlessly. He has a knack for making the invisible \u2013 people, usually, the poor, the marginalised, the forgotten \u2013 visible. It\u2019s a sort of magic trick, I realise, making people appear, making us take notice, although it\u2019s David Blaine, the American street magician, who is actually the one who points this out to me. Blaine is known for his feats of endurance that exist somewhere at the edge of art and magic and madness \u2013 he once spent 44 days in a Plexiglass box suspended above the Thames \u2013 and he\u2019s a friend of JR\u2019s. \u201cJR sees things from a different perspective,\u201d Blaine tells me. \u201cHe pasted this figure of a person, hundreds of metres long, on the sidewalk at Fifth Avenue and Madison and everybody was walking over it and nobody saw it until it was photographed from above. It was completely invisible but suddenly seen by everyone. The way he\u2019s using his art has made me think about magic in a very deep and personal way.\u201d When I meet JR, it\u2019s just a few weeks since Europe\u2019s refugee crisis has finally hit the top of the political agenda propelled by the heartbreaking image of a small dead boy on a beach. And it strikes me that it\u2019s a real-life example of exactly what JR has spent the past 10 years trying to do. It\u2019s all about trying to get people to take notice of the people we spend most of our lives failing to see, or maybe, more accurately, trying to avoid seeing. JR\u2019s work has been to find a strange angle or a previously hidden corner and bring them to us. He shows us them at massive scale, or across landscapes, or just in some new or surprising or beautiful way we weren\u2019t expecting. JR used to be one of those people. A banlieue kid. Half Arab \u2013 his father is Tunisian \u2013 he grew up on the wrong side of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, the ring-road that separates the bourgeois quartiers of central Paris from the places where it houses its large immigrant population: in huge concrete cit\u00e9s or public housing projects. It was in one of these, Les Bosquets, that JR came to take photographs 12 years ago and set in train the sequence of events that\u2019s led him to where he is today. It was in the same suburb that the riots kicked off exactly a decade ago, the riots that swept through the banlieues and then the rest of France over a period of weeks and saw running battles with the police and more than 10,000 vehicles destroyed. And when I meet him, he\u2019s back in the neighbourhood with a film called Les Bosquets. Even by JR\u2019s standards, the project is a stretch. As a concept, it\u2019s bordering on hallucinatory: a classical ballet performed in a housing estate reimagining the events of the 2005 riots. It\u2019s just 17 minutes long and, in the blasted concrete wastelands, mixes first-hand video footage of the riots with ballet and modern street dance he has choreographed himself.         Women are Heroes trailer.    It is as extraordinary as it sounds and yet it\u2019s a tiny fragment of his work in progress. I have a massive paving slab of a book in my bag, a retrospective of his work published this month by Phaidon, and the shoulder-sagging weight of it is a testament to the super-sized nature of almost everything to do with JR\u2019s output: the breakneck pace of it, the sheer number of projects he\u2019s done, the global reach of his ambition. \u201cAnd he\u2019s how old?\u201d Emmanuel Perrotin, his Parisian gallerist, asks me. \u201cHe\u2019s what? 32? The evolution of his career is astonishing for his age.\u201d Perrotin gave Damien Hirst his first commercial show and though JR is most often compared to Banksy, he says he sees greater parallels with Hirst. \u201cI was in Shanghai in a car driving very fast and in the landscape I saw a water tower with an old woman\u2019s face on it and was like, \u2018Whoa!\u2019 I recognised it immediately as a JR even when I had no idea he had ever done anything in this city. That was the moment I thought differently about him.\u201d I meet JR on the eve of a major show in Perrotin\u2019s gallery and he\u2019s in the final editing throes of another short film about Ellis Island \u2013 called Ellis \u2013 another tiny, no-budget art film that just happens to have Robert De Niro in the starring role. And every time I look at his Instagram feed \u2013 he\u2019s embraced technology and is one of the most popular artists on the platform with 679,000 followers \u2013 I find another arresting image. This week: a huge pair of eyes staring out of a pedestrian bridge in Toronto. Days earlier, a portrait of an immigrant called Ibrahim pasted across 50 storeys of a building in Philadelphia. Last week, a huge solitary man several hundred metres up a skyscraper in Boston. \u201cHe is pure energy,\u201d says Perrotin. \u201cThe amount he does\u2026 that he\u2019s doing\u2026 it is really incredible.\u201d It\u2019s telling that Shepard Fairey \u2013 the street artist who produced Obama\u2019s campaign posters \u2013 has called JR the most ambitious artist he\u2019s ever met. It\u2019s just that with most artists \u2013 or anybody, actually \u2013 that would be code for an ego of unprecedented proportions. And yet, almost all of JR\u2019s work is to do with other people. It\u2019s about making their faces seen, making their voices heard.   Related: Can art change the world? The work of street artist JR \u2013 in pictures    \u201cI\u2019ve never known him reluctant to meet anybody,\u201d says David Blaine. \u201cHis curiosity is not one-sided. He likes interacting with people. Talking to them, seeing their reactions.\u201d He\u2019s not kidding. At the premiere of Les Bosquets, he hops around afterwards, talking to everyone with a friendly informality, a lean, wiry figure who seems to have more energy than he knows what to do with. He\u2019s in his trademark hat and sunglasses. He uses semi-anonymity \u2013 he always wears the hat and glasses in public \u2013 but it\u2019s for practical reasons he says. He doesn\u2019t want to be recognised in the streets or have problems getting into countries where they don\u2019t want him. It\u2019s a deeply incongruous film, Les Bosquets. The crowd, an audience mostly of invited locals many of whom starred in it as extras, applaud wildly at the end. Gorgeous dancers in pristine white silk tutus are interspersed with graphic scenes of the riots and in this, it\u2019s as good a showcase for the JR method as anything: an outrageous idea, flawlessly executed with the help of a huge cast of collaborators, in this instance classically trained ballet dancers from the Paris Opera and one of the most successful songwriters du jour, Pharrell Williams: he\u2019s another friend, it turns out.         Les Bosquets (2015), trailer, with music by Pharrell Williams.    \u201cI had this footage of this building being demolished and I wanted some music to go with it and I asked Pharrell, can you write something for it. And he was the one who said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you make something bigger?\u2019\u201d It is bigger. It may only be 17 minutes long and yet it is by turns thrilling and terrifying and touching with the kind of wildly dramatic score you\u2019d have in a high-concept Hollywood movie, hardly a coincidence because Pharrell persuaded Hans Zimmer, an Oscar and multi-Grammy award winner who has scored many Hollywood blockbusters, such as The Lion King, the Pirates of the Caribbean series and The Da Vinci Code, to get involved. But then, JR seems to have a number of collaborators practically queuing up to work with him. As well as Robert De Niro, I spot on his Instagram feed Darren Aronofsky, Spike Jonze, David O Russell and Sacha Baron Cohen. There are projects afoot but he\u2019s keeping his cards close to his chest. Your film-making is a dream, I say. I don\u2019t think this is how it normally works, that Oscar winners line up to offer their services for nothing? \u201cIt\u2019s because everything is non-commercial,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no producer or money or anything. There\u2019s not even any guarantee that anyone will see it as he\u2019s deliberately not releasing his work online. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy today to just watch something on your phone, alone, on the train,\u201d he says. He wants people to gather. \u201cIt marks them and creates something that they will remember.\u201d There\u2019s a purity to everything JR does. He finances everything himself. He refuses to work with brands or institutions. He\u2019s taken a stance against the dominant visual culture of our lives: advertising. In most cities, they\u2019re the only images the size of JR\u2019s artworks and they\u2019re selling cars or underpants or perfume. JR replaces products with people. He\u2019s returning the city to its people. He won the TED prize ($100,000 to be spent on a \u201cwish to change the world\u201d) in 2011, which gave rise to the launch of his biggest project to date,  Inside Out \u2013 the ultimate expression of that principle. He wanted people everywhere to take back their towns, their cities, their streets. Upload a photo on insideoutproject.net and his team will create a poster-sized print and send it to you free, wherever you are. More than 100,000 have now been pasted in more than 140 countries so far and the project is ongoing. It could have been the world\u2019s biggest selfie-fest but the best of them \u2013 in Tunisia, for example, where after the revolution the presidential palace was graphically returned to the people with their faces in every window \u2013 are beautiful and moving. Humans are at the centre of everything that JR does and their photographs are as fascinating and varied and emotional as humans are.         JR\u2019s TED presentation, 2011.    The project, however, has been \u201ca hole where money disappears\u201d, he says. Hundreds of people \u2013 the CEOs and billionaires at TED \u2013 offered to help finance it initially, \u201cbut they were like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll give you 10 cars if we can put our logo on it. And I was like, \u2018No just do it for the kids. Just do it to do it.\u2019 And none of them wanted to. In the end, there were maybe five or six who really helped. But the rest, they wanted their logo on something.\u201d Are you in something of a war against brands? \u201cNot a war. I just don\u2019t like it when they take over public spaces\u2026 I remember when we were in the Middle East, people would ask us, \u2018Who\u2019s financing this?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No one. Are you kidding?\u2019 And they said, \u2018It\u2019s so big that we assumed it had to be an oil company or something.\u2019\u201d Over time, he says, he\u2019s tried to remove himself from his work entirely. \u201cIn Brazil [the favela project], I left the country and let the people speak for it. It was so much more interesting than whatever I could say. My whole world has been how can I keep a distance from it. Until I said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m not even going to go there. People are going to paste that photo without me and not even credit where it comes from.\u2019 That\u2019s our Inside Out project. They were pasting in Haiti, in Pakistan. I\u2019ve never even been to Pakistan.\u201d He understands the need for people to be seen, because he felt it so strongly himself. \u201cI started in graffiti, where you write your own name. I was coming from that egocentric thing where you go and say, \u2018Hey I\u2019m JR\u2019. I really understand that mentality of wanting to exist in a city that\u2019s full of advertising and code. But once I started taking other people\u2019s photos, and especially, at that moment, pasting them, when I realised that I was giving them a voice, I realised that was so much more powerful.\u201d That was the lesson he learned in Les Bosquets 12 years ago. His friend Ladj Ly, who was experimenting with video, took him to the banlieue where he grew up. \u201cI had a camera with me and there were all these kids saying, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take our photo?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t even my camera. It was a friend\u2019s family camera and it was [old-fashioned] film so you couldn\u2019t see what you were taking photos of.\u201d But there was a moment when Ladj raised his video camera like a gun. \u201cAnd I took it, boom. And then I said, \u2018Whoa, let\u2019s do it again.\u2019 But the kids had run away and I never made it again. There was just a single shot. I went to a one-hour photo place and I knew immediately that I had something.\u201d     Ladj Ly by JR, 2003: \u2018I knew immediately that I had something.\u2019 Photograph: JR    Twelve years on, it\u2019s still a powerful image, the camera Ladj\u2019s weapon. JR knew he wanted to show it somewhere. \u201cI thought somewhere in the centre first but then I looked around at all the broken buildings, completely full of graffiti, and I thought that\u2019s where it should be. That\u2019s where it makes most sense. I wanted to make it big but I didn\u2019t know how. Eventually I found a printer that did architect plans and got him to print strips of black ink. It was all new, learning how to do it.\u201d Pasting it took four nights. \u201cThe police would come but we got the kids to hang out at the bottom of the ladder.\u201d It might have all ended there but two years later when Paris burned, that photo of Ladj, huge and menacing, became a backdrop to the violence. \u201cIt was really weird because suddenly that image took on a completely different meaning. It was there on the news with fires burning in front of it.\u201d The media coverage of the riots was a huge part of the story. \u201cIt was quiet every night at 8pm because everyone was inside watching themselves on the news\u201d; the kids he knew \u201cbeing portrayed like animals\u201d. They were being filmed with long lenses from a distance. \u201cIt was the first time I questioned the distance,\u201d he says. His response was to take a tiny camera and shoot the kids in extreme closeup. He got them to act out the caricatures that they thought they were being portrayed as. And then he pasted them, super-sized, in the banlieue, but also in the centre of Paris. \u201cI put their name, age, even their building number. Because from Paris, it looked like they were an army that was about to invade.\u201d Since then, Ladj\u2019s photo, several hundred metres high, has been pasted across the outside of Tate Modern and the sense of mission that JR developed then has driven all his work since. The surburbs, he says, are the city, inside out. And it\u2019s Ladj who provides the voiceover in the film Les Bosquets. \u201cAt the time, I needed the attention to prove that I existed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made me feel a little bit better.\u201d I speak to Ladj later and he tells me what JR was like then (\u201cfull of energy, always doing stuff\u201d) and he mentions that he still lives in Les Bosquets. Why? I ask him. \u201cC\u2019est la lutte de ma vie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the fight of my life.\u201d JR now lives in New York but it still feels like he\u2019s in the fight of his life too. And while he has acquired new, famous collaborators, he still works with the same gang he had back in the suburbs. He has a studio in Paris and one in New York and it\u2019s full of people he\u2019s known for years. \u201cI\u2019ve known them for ever so it\u2019s like we\u2019re one big family,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. Anywhere I go I feel like I\u2019m home in a way, since I\u2019m with friends and people I know. That\u2019s one thing that\u2019s really important when working with a team \u2013 that it\u2019s the same team.\u201d Emile Abinal, the head of his Paris studio, tells me how he met JR when he was still an art student. \u201cThe first time I saw his stuff in the street, I was just like \u2018Wow!\u2019 It was completely new and different. I used to tear them down and keep them. He did these photographs with big spray-painted frames that he called \u2018Expo de Rue\u2019 [street exhibition].\u201d     JR lives in Tribeca, New York City now but he still works with the same gang he had back in the Paris suburbs. Photograph: Mike McGregor/the Observer    They became friends and Emile eventually started working with him full-time. \u201cIt\u2019s always changing,\u201d he says now. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why we are all so loyal. There\u2019s always something new. He has an incredible energy, like you can\u2019t imagine. He doesn\u2019t drink or smoke. He gives all his energy to his work. To interacting with people. He\u2019s always focused on his art. It\u2019s his way of living.\u201d He tells me about some of their escapades in Liberia, including an incident where they found themselves at the mercy of a bunch of kids with guns. \u201cBut JR just talked and talked with them. He has a way of communicating with people.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9bel, former director of the Arles photo festival and the Magnum photo agency, also met JR early on, when he came across him pasting outside an official photography exhibition. \u201cI looked out the doorway and I saw him across the way up a ladder, pasting these little contact strips. He was very young but there was something about it. It was surprisingly mature.\u201d A few years later, H\u00e9bel was one of the first to bring JR inside the art fold with a prestigious show at Arles. He says it\u2019s been astonishing to watch his career progress. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly changing. He\u2019s building, building, building. Every project, he\u2019s another step ahead. It\u2019s very frustrating to me because I can\u2019t see how he can just step into something completely new like ballet but that\u2019s exactly what he does. We used to have these arguments. I\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s very political what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s got nothing to do with politics!\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Of course it has.\u2019 Whatever he has done, it\u2019s the new politics, it\u2019s direct action.\u201d     A detail of JR\u2019s installation on Ellis Island. Photograph: JR    It is and he\u2019s right at the edge of one of the biggest contemporary debates: who belongs? Who matters? He made a huge installation of old photographs of 19th-century immigrants to New York inside the crumbling immigration buildings of Ellis Island, which led to the film Ellis, and lately he\u2019s been pasting photographs of more recent immigrants on cityscapes across America. And then there\u2019s the container ship that he turned into a massive world-circumnavigating artwork (the containers are his \u201cpixels\u201d) that ended up rescuing a boatload of immigrants from Libya who were drifting helplessly off Greece. Indeed, there\u2019s a random, happenstance quality to almost everything JR does. One thing leads to another. One person leads to another. How did he even have the idea of bringing the ballet dancers to the banlieue, I ask him. \u201cI\u2019d just finished choreographing a ballet for New York City Ballet\u2026\u201d But how did he even come to do a ballet in the first place? There follows a rambling and slightly fantastical explanation of how he came to do a full-scale ballet about the French riots with the New York City Ballet, one of the leading companies in the world, not ever having seen a ballet until that point. But then everything with JR seems to have a rambling and slightly fantastical explanation. \u201cThere\u2019s no goal as such,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, even now, I couldn\u2019t tell you what I\u2019ll do next year. Even last year I couldn\u2019t tell you that I was going to do a ballet. I love not knowing. The question people always ask me is, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 It\u2019s really scary when you work like that. There could be nothing next. But I like being able to change direction at any time.\u201d So, what\u2019s next? \u201cI don\u2019t know! I\u2019m in a faultline. I\u2019m at risk.

Choose correctly, and you\u2019re guaranteed years of fun and entertainment; make a bad call, and you\u2019ll have a useless black box under your TV, endlessly incurring the disappointment and embarrassment of your children and the mockery of your friends.  So let\u2019s say you\u2019ve committed to buying at least one shiny new machine. Which should it be? Here is a quick guide to where the big consoles are right now. The technology     Xbox One as first revealed by Microsoft in 2013.    We\u2019re not going to list all the tech specs here, so click through the official PlayStation 4, Wii U and Xbox One information at your leisure \u2013 or IGN has a  big comparison chart while Trusted Reviews goes into lots of  technical detail. In terms of power consumption, Xbox One and PS4 have both been criticised for the amount of juice they get through, especially if you\u2019re leaving them in standby mode, or using one of the sleep modes to allow seamless downloads of game updates. A report last year found that the Xbox One can use up to 253 kWh per year, with PS4 on 184 kWh per year. Although Sony\u2019s machine consumes more power while gaming, Xbox One is more greedy in standby mode. Both companies say they are addressing power consumption in firmware updates. Wii U is much more power efficient, on 37 kWh/year. All three machines have proved reliable so far, with Microsoft particularly determined to make up for the technical issues that plagued the Xbox 360, providing vastly improved cooling systems. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Sony and Microsoft\u2019s machines are essentially moderately powerful desktop computers with very similar technical specifications \u2013 the only real difference being the type of RAM, or memory, they use, and the rendering power of the graphics processors (PS4 has more teraflops). For a while, developers were getting better performance out of the PlayStation 4 and many still think it has the superior architecture, though Xbox One titles are catching up.  The important thing is that both machines are considered to be around 8-10 times more powerful than the PS3 and Xbox 360. You can expect to get true high definition (1080p) performance out of most games \u2013 and, on a big full-HD display, titles like Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid 5 look gorgeous. Wii U Nintendo never competes on technology, so Wii U is much less powerful than the other consoles and games don\u2019t look quite as beautiful as their Xbox One and PS4 counterparts. However, if you\u2019re buying this thing, you\u2019re not getting it for flashy multiplatform titles like Fifa, you\u2019re getting it for exclusive Nintendo games, which have a visual charm of their own \u2013 and many run in full 1080p HD. Hardware features     PS4 controller at the Sony booth during the China Joy fair in Shanghai, 2014. Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images    Both PS4 and Xbox One come with chat headsets so you can talk to friends online, and both have features that let you record and share video online, either streaming live or uploading to YouTube (though it takes time to figure out). All have wireless controllers. PlayStation 4 The DualShock 4 controller offers an innovative touchpad (which hardly any developers use, apart from as an extra button), as well as the usual analogue sticks, six-axis motion controls (again, hardly used), shoulder buttons and all that. There\u2019s also a share button for uploading videos and screenshots of your gaming, a headphone socket and a built-in speaker which allows certain game noises to pop out at you unexpectedly. It\u2019s comfortable and familiar to PlayStation veterans.  A PlayStation Camera is available separately, offering voice control, facial recognition and picture-in-picture video footage of yourself if you like streaming games. The camera will also be an essential component in Sony\u2019s virtual reality plans. Its PlayStation VR headset (previously known as Project Morpheus) is due out next year. Wii U The biggest \u201cunique selling point\u201d of the Wii U is its GamePad, essentially a sort of tablet computer, with its own touchscreen display and joypad controls. This allows you to continue playing your games even if someone else is hogging the TV. It is also used by certain titles as an extra display, perhaps showing a game map or inventory. Some initial games, such as Nintendoland, offered asymmetrical multiplayer, so one participant using the GamePad did different things than other players using standard controllers. But everyone seems to have forgotten about that.  Xbox One The machine used to come with a new version of its Kinect motion tracking camera as standard, but it was expensive, games didn\u2019t use it much and everyone was fed up with it, so now Microsoft has largely ditched it \u2013 you can still buy it if you want to use facial recognition and voice commands to control your console though. The controller is a refined version of the familiar Xbox pad; it\u2019s chunkier than the PS4 equivalent, but has super comfortable analogue sticks and really accurate rumble effects so you get excellent tactile feedback. There\u2019s a new Elite version coming out with interchangeable parts for pro gamers who like to interchange things. The games     The E3 expo in Los Angeles where hundreds of new games and gaming devices are introduced to over 40,000 visitors. Photograph: MICHAEL NELSON/EPA    Most of the big blockbuster \u201cmultiplatform\u201d games (Assassin\u2019s Creed, Call of Duty, Fifa) will come to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, usually at the same time and price. Sometimes publishers work out timed exclusivity deals so that a big title will appear on one machine first \u2013 this is happening with Rise of the Tomb Raider, which will be on Xbox One before Christmas, but not PS4. Publishers may also tie up deals with Sony or Microsoft to offer exclusive content \u2013 like multiplayer maps or weapons \u2013 to one machine. Try not to be swayed by timed exclusives though \u2013 for the sake of getting a single title a few weeks early, you may be saddled with a machine you don\u2019t want. For a while, PlayStation 4 was getting visually superior versions of many multiplatform games, with smoother framerates and support for Full HD, but this seems to be equalling out. Eurogamer has a good analysis of this.  PlayStation 4 exclusives Sony has a worldwide network of \u201cfirst-party\u201d studios that produce games only for its hardware. It has also tied up exclusivity deals with publishers on key games. So far, however, its exclusive titles haven\u2019t been Earth-shattering with only the dark adventure Bloodborne and the smaller indie titles Resogun and N++ really hitting the heights. It has relied on remasters of great PS3 games, such as Last of Us and God of War.  Coming up, however, are Uncharted: A Thief\u2019s End, the enchanting adventure Last Guardian, vast space epic No Man\u2019s Sky and prehistoric role-playing game Horizon: Zero Dawn. It\u2019s a big, intriguing line-up. Wii U exclusives The best Wii U titles tend to be the ones Nintendo makes itself, or that have been designed by one of its very close development partners in Japan. The current line-up (Mario Kart 8, Super Smash Bros, Splatoon) is skewed toward kid-friendly local multiplayer, but no one on earth does this like Nintendo, and there\u2019s always enough tactical depth for older players.  On the way we have Mario Tennis, Star Fox Zero, a new Zelda title, retro platformer Mighty No 9, a survival horror sequel and Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water. There are not as many releases as for the other machines, but the really good Wii U titles will occupy you and your family for months.  Xbox One exclusives Like Sony, Microsoft has its own studios all over the world (though it has every little developer support in Japan). As with PS4, the Xbox One hasn\u2019t exactly been overloaded with legendary exclusives so far, relying heavily on the motor sport titles Forza and Forza Horizon, and giant robot blast\u2019em-up Titanfall. However, crazed shooter Sunset Overdrive, and beautiful indie titles Lovers in a Dangerous Space Time and Ori and the Blind Forest are worth a look.  Coming up we have Halo 5: Guardians, interesting sci-fi adventure ReCore, 1940s-inspired platformer Cuphead, Gears of War 4, open-world epic Crackdown 3 and giant monster-slaying fantasy Scalebound. It\u2019s a very strong slate, especially for veteran Xbox fans who\u2019ve waited patiently for some old favourites to return. The services     Yes, you can watch Netflix and perhaps even chill in front of your Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    All three consoles allow you to connect seamlessly to the internet via Wi-Fi or ethernet cable (the Wii U requires an extra peripheral for wired connections). Each one offers access to an array of video services such as BBC iPlayer, Netflix and YouTube, though the exact line-ups are different from machine to machine. PS4 and Xbox One both play Blu-ray and DVD movies, Wii U won\u2019t play either. PlayStation 4 If you want to play PS4 games online you\u2019ll need to join Playstation Network, which costs \u00a335 a year and also gives you access to free games through the excellent PlayStation Plus service. Along with all the usual video-on-demand services, PS4 has its own version of Spotify, which lets you play your own music choices in the background while gaming. PlayStation 4 is not backwards compatible with older games so you won\u2019t be able to put in a PS2 or PS3 disc and play it. Instead, Sony has a service called PlayStation Now which lets you rent retro titles for between \u00a32.99 and \u00a37.99. You can also buy a PlayStation TV box which costs \u00a345 and lets you stream your PS4 content to other TVs in your house, as well as download a handful of classic PlayStation titles.  Wii U Nintendo\u2019s machine has a modest range of video apps and services, as well as a really friendly and nicely designed online community called Miiverse, which lets players share content and ask for gaming advice in a safe way. You can also download lots of classic titles via the Virtual Console digital shop. But it\u2019s very much a games machine rather than a multimedia hub.  Xbox One Xbox Live Gold is the service you\u2019ll need to subscribe to in order to play against others online \u2013 like PlayStation Network, this also offers monthly free games. It\u2019s still a more robust infrastructure than Sony\u2019s, which has suffered a series of hacker attacks over the past two years. Again, there\u2019s a big list of apps and entertainment services. Xbox One offers HDMI throughput, which lets you plug in your satellite or cable box, then view it all through your console without having to keep unplugging all your leads. It has the capacity to watch live TV, too, so it\u2019s very effective as a multimedia \u201cset-top box\u201d that you can put in your living room and use to run all your screened entertainment. The console also integrates closely with Windows 10, so you\u2019ll be able to keep up with your Xbox Live friends via your PC and even try cross-platform online multiplayer games between consoles and computers.  The price     A game store in Tokyo. Although you may find more competitive console prices online, the major high street retailers occasionally tie-up exclusive bundles Photograph: Toru Hanai/REUTERS    The price of all three consoles has fallen since they first arrived and you should shop around for the best deals. Look especially for special bundles that may well throw in a game you really want with the machine at no extra cost. All come with at least one official controller and the leads you need to plug it into your TV. PlayStation 4 A basic PS4 package with a 500GB hard drive will cost about \u00a3280, with a 1TB model at about \u00a3299. It\u2019s worth looking out for game bundles \u2013 there are Fifa, Batman, Destiny and Uncharted Collection versions around right now. Wii U The basic pack is \u00a3180 making this the cheapest current generation console available. However there are premium packs (with 32GB hard drives instead of 8GB) complete with Mario Kart 8, Super Mario Maker, Splatoon or Super Smash Bros. These make it \u00a3240-\u00a3260. Xbox One A basic Xbox One with 500GB drive comes in at \u00a3270, or \u00a3350 with the 1TB drive. There will be a range of bundles to accompany the release of Halo 5 at the end of October. Conclusion So which console is best for you? Before you decide there\u2019s one important factor to consider. \u201cFollow your friends,\u201d says Oli Welsh, editor of Eurogamer. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever to be on the same platform as people you know in order to get the full online, social experience\u201d. Indeed, there are so many titles nowadays that offer compelling cooperative and competitive multiplayer gaming (Destiny, Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate, Star Wars Battlefront, Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division), you\u2019ll want to have the same machine as your mates. With that in mind \u2026 PlayStation 4 is best for: People who want to play a wide range of games, from blockbusters to indie titles, with the best visuals and with decent multiplayer components. It is selling better than Xbox One, making it the target platform for many studios. There\u2019s also the potential to experience virtual reality soon courtesy of the PlayStation VR headset. Wii U is best for: Families who want to sit and play bright, accessible and compelling games together on the sofa. You won\u2019t get all the big blockbuster titles such as Call of Duty and Metal Gear Solid, but this is the only place you\u2019ll get the latest games from one of the best design studios in the world. The machine hasn\u2019t sold brilliantly, though, and there\u2019s a chance Nintendo may announce a successor, currently codenamed Nintendo NX this summer \u2013 maybe even for a winter release. Xbox One is best for: People who want a games machine that\u2019s also a powerful multimedia hub able to control all of their entertainment from video-on-demand to satellite TV. The online infrastructure is comparatively secure and the Windows 10 implementation may interest PC users. There\u2019s also a great range of exclusive titles.  \u201cCome Christmas, Xbox One will a different proposition to the machine that launched two years ago,\u201d says Official Xbox Magazine editor, Matthew Castle. \u201cThe Windows 10-powered \u2018New User Experience\u2019 will replace the clunky panelled interface of today \u2013 a hangover from its original Kinect dependency \u2013 with a faster, simpler home page and the option to bark commands at Cortana. More importantly, it has actual new games to play \u2013 Halo 5, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Forza 6, Fable Legends \u2013 and where it does lean on re-releases, it does so generously, such as Rare Replay\u2019s tasty 30 games for \u00a320.\u201d Our recommendation: right now, PlayStation 4 is in a very strong position as a pure high-end gaming machine. Xbox One is improving all the time, but Sony\u2019s console has a big head start, with 25m machines sold compared to around 14m Xbox Ones, putting it at the forefront of publisher development plans. If you can afford it, Wii U is a lovely second machine.", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "PlayStation", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox", "Xbox One", "PS3", "Wii", "Wii U", "Nintendo"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-12T06:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/12/gothic-for-the-steam-age-gavin-stamp-review-george-gilbert-scott", "sentences": ["He created the colossal Nikolaikirche in Hamburg, whose spire was for a short time the tallest building in the world, and, although he never himself left Europe, his designs were realised in Bombay, Shanghai, Newfoundland,\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand and South Africa."], "title": "Gothic for the Steam Age by Gavin Stamp review \u2013 St Pancras architect finds a champion at last", "article": "The most poignant story in this book concerns its subject\u2019s son, also called George Gilbert Scott, also an architect. Having abandoned his father\u2019s gothic for the Queen Anne style, and his Anglican faith for Catholicism, he later left his wife and children for a mistress in Rouen until, suffering from\u00a0alcoholism and mental disorders, he was sent to a hospital in Northampton, where his father had designed the chapel. He was, finally, forcibly confined to the Midland Grand\u00a0hotel at St Pancras station, also by his father, and amid its polychromatic, foliated,\u00a0quasi\u2011medieval wallpapers,\u00a0died. George junior\u2019s experience stands for anyone who lived in the great asylum of Victorian England, for whom the architecture of George senior was inescapable. Gavin Stamp\u2019s book tells us that he worked in all the counties of England and Wales, except\u00a0Cardigan. He was (and still is) present in almost every English cathedral, which he restored with varying degrees of respect for the original. Whitehall is dominated by his Foreign Office building. He designed the quintessential ejaculation \u00a0of morbid Victoriana, the\u00a0Albert Memorial, and the place that would crush Oscar Wilde, Reading Gaol. He did churches, both new ones and restorations of old ones, in the hundreds, in (for example) Swindon, Ramsgate, Rugby, Stoke and Halifax, in Spalding, Lincs and Worsley, Lancs. He worked abroad. He created the colossal Nikolaikirche in Hamburg, whose spire was for a short time the tallest building in the world, and, although he never himself left Europe, his designs were realised in Bombay, Shanghai, Newfoundland,\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand and South Africa. He was, as the book\u2019s title says, a creation of the steam age, his incredible productivity and geographical range being made possible by the ability of railways to take him all over the country. (Although he launched his practice, in his 20s, in the stagecoach era, dashing about the country to secure commissions to design workhouses, trains evidently amplified a pre-existing dromomania.) He also thrived off the wealth created by industry, and the desire to convert it into stone-carved piety. He was a new kind of architect, with unprecedented output, who at the same time wanted to revive the handbuilt craftsmanship of the middle ages. History has been begrudging to him, which Stamp wants to put right. He attracted the criticism aimed at prolific architects ever since, including Norman Foster now, that he couldn\u2019t possibly have given all his projects the attention they required. Anecdotes support this view: he admired a church he saw from a train and had to be told that it was one of his; he started issuing instructions on the site of another which turned out to be by a different architect, Scott\u2019s project being along the road.     George Gilbert Scott: criticised for his restoration work. Photograph: Alamy    He was accused of being, in effect, too middlebrow, insufficiently daring or original. There were other Victorian architects who played more excitingly with the gothic style. Above all he was repeatedly attacked for his restorations, by William Morris and others. He was said to be too interventionist, too willing to remove old work that didn\u2019t fit his view of what a church should be, and to insert his own versions of medieval architecture. It is probably for these reasons that a biography like Stamp\u2019s hasn\u2019t appeared until now. Stamp defends him on the grounds that originality is overrated in architecture and that stolid professionals like Scott deserve credit. He argues that Scott was more\u00a0sensitive to the fabric of old buildings than the critics allowed, and that his extensive rebuilding was sometimes necessitated by the poor state of the churches, and sometimes because of the demands placed on Scott by his clients. He sketches a complex character, generous, sometimes self-aggrandising, \u00a0with a prickliness possibly owing to his lack of the university education that his brothers had, but Scott seems to have worked too hard and to have been too upstanding a citizen to make a really juicy subject for a biographer. The interest in Scott, and in the book, lies mostly in the professional and cultural\u00a0phenomenon that he represented, rather than in his personal life, although one informs the\u00a0other. Stamp\u2019s book performs a valuable role, and offers a glimpse into a world which in the scale of constructional production prefigures our own, but in other ways seems utterly arcane. It was a time when limitless passion could be expended on the choice of one kind of gothic over another, or on the arrangement of church furniture, representing as they did one shade of Christianity against another. Limitless vitriol could be exchanged between adherents of different views on these\u00a0matters. By these lights Scott\u2019s most powerful building, what is now called\u00a0the St Pancras Renaissance hotel, was one of his more corrupt, it being considered questionable to lavish the nobility of gothic decoration\u00a0on what is, in effect, a commercial building\u2019s advertisement of itself. Scott himself had doubts on the matter. But, really, the countless churches can be too pious and dutiful: it is the hotel\u2019s honest vulgarity that makes it good.

And Scotland acquitted themselves well too, conceding just the one against Gibraltar at Hampden, so well done to everyone involved with that.  But everything has been firmly put in the shade by England, who are a mere 90 minutes away from becoming only the fifth country in history to qualify for a Euros with a 100% record, a mighty achievement in a tough group featuring Switzerland, Lithuania, San Marino, Basingstoke Town and a five-a-side team consisting of Eric Pickles, Morrissey, Paul Konchesky, Christian Poulsen and Granny Fiver.

It contributes about 14% of global economic output. The size and interconnectedness of its economic activities mean that the knock-on effects are felt far and wide.  But China is also a primary engine of growth for international higher education, leading the way in student recruitment, English and Chinese language programmes, transnational education and short-term study abroad. The country, therefore, is critical to the economics of global higher education \u2013 and understanding the developments there will enable universes across the world to create informed institutional strategies and adapt to a rapidly shifting landscape. So here are some of the key trends related to the internationalisation of Chinese higher education:   Related: Academics: would you teach in China?    1. China is making itself more attractive to international students In 2014, there were almost 380,000 international students from more than 200 countries studying at universities in China. Nearly 35% of those students were based in either Beijing or Shanghai, and the majority \u2013 56% \u2013 were on short-term, non-degree programmes, learning Chinese language and culture. The Chinese ministry of education launched the Study in China plan in 2010, which aims to attract 500,000 students by 2020. The challenge is to make China an attractive destination for degree-seeking international students. Several policy initiatives are in the works, including bilateral partnerships (such as the recent UK-China initiative), additional scholarships for one-year language preparation courses, more programmes in English, and easier access to the job market for international students.  2. Economic issues are unlikely to hit higher education In the wake of recent worries about the Chinese economy, many institutions have aired concerns about the impact on international student enrollment. Could this be the beginning of the end of the China growth story? As I have written before, I don\u2019t think so.   Related: Researchers, brush up your Mandarin and get ready to spend time in China    In 2014, 1.7 million Chinese students were enrolled in institutions around the world. In that year alone, 459,800 Chinese left China to study abroad; an increase of 11% from the year before. Of those students, the vast majority - about 92% - were self-funded. Given the size and scale of the wealthy classes in China, the demand for high-school and undergraduate education abroad is likely to remain strong. For many Chinese families, an international education is seen as an investment in a recession-proof, premium product (for which many have saved and prepared for a long time). But self-funded graduate education at both the master\u2019s and doctoral levels could potentially face challenges for the next couple of years. 3. Joint international projects are due to increase In 2014, nearly 600 Chinese universities were working in partnership with foreign institutions to offer more than 1,100 joint programmes for bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and doctoral degrees, according to the China Education Association for International Exchange (CEAIE).  These cross-border joint ventures are especially important for countries like the UK. More Chinese entrants to English higher education institutions started their first degree through a transnational education pathway (55%) in 2013-14 than through direct student recruitment (36%), according to a recent report from the Higher Education Funding Council for England.    Related: Links with China: why Australian universities are leading the way     There is an increasing focus on addressing the quality of cross-border partnerships, with the goal of enhancing the attractiveness and influence of the Study in China plan.  New initiatives, such as partnerships along the Silk Road, are set to create further opportunities for engagement with China. And the dependency of many higher education institutions on Chinese students to meet their international student recruitment goals means that the country will continue to be a dominant part of international strategies in the short to medium term. Interest among international students looks likely to grow too, as the government pushes on with a proactive policy agenda and the country\u2019s institutions improve support services and outreach to young people across the globe.

A 1217 version held by Hereford Cathedral, one of only 17 surviving 13th-century texts of the Great Charter, was put on show at the British ambassador\u2019s residence on Tuesday. It will head to Shanghai and Guangzhou later in the week.    #MagnaCarta is in China now! @MagnaCarta800th \u300a\u5927\u5baa\u7ae0\u300b\u6765\u5230\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e86\uff01 pic.twitter.com/r0FKZiOIou&mdash; UK in China (@ukinchina) October 13, 2015    British officials have hailed Magna Carta\u2019s arrival as the latest milestone in a \u201cgolden era\u201d of UK-China relations during which Xi will pay a state visit to Britain next week.   Related: Magna Carta: explore the document in full    Mark Gill, the head of the Magna Carta 800th anniversary committee, said he hoped to boost awareness and understanding of the text, which was issued in 1215 by King John of England and is held up as a symbol of government accountability and individual freedoms. Fewer than one in five people in China had even heard of it, Gill claimed. As the Magna Carta went on show, Chinese activists called on Xi \u2013 who has been accused of launching an unforgiving crackdown on dissent \u2013 to go to see a text the British Library has called \u201ca potent, international rallying cry against the arbitrary use of power\u201d. \u201cI very much hope that Xi can go and see [the exhibition],\u201d said Yu Wensheng, an outspoken attorney who was among those targeted during a continuing roundup of civil rights lawyers. Yu said Magna Carta\u2019s presence in China \u201cshould serve as a reminder to [Xi] and the leadership that cracking down on lawyers is wrong and futile\u201d. Liu Shihui, another civil rights lawyer, noted Xi often name-checked famous pieces of writing, including Hemingway and Dostoyevsky. \u201cI hope he can spend some time reading Magna Carta,\u201d Liu said.  Sir Martin Davidson, the chairman of the Great Britain China Centre in Beijing for the exhibition\u2019s launch, recognised King John\u2019s text was arriving at a sensitive time. A political chill has descended on Beijing since Xi came to power in 2012 and a severe crackdown is under way. \u201cOne wouldn\u2019t be surprised that it is slightly uncomfortable because I think China is struggling with some of those very big issues about what is the relationship between the state and the law, what comprises the state,\u201d he said. Many Chinese were interested in Magna Carta because it symbolised the moment at which \u201cthe king became subject to the rule of law and the king\u2019s power was, if you like, constrained by the nature of the rule of law\u201d, Davidson said. But he denied that bringing the document to China was an attempt to preach to Beijing. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any point in saying: \u2018We\u2019ve got a system, just copy it.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d   Related: The Guardian view on Magna Carta: the magic of myth | Editorial    During a speech in June marking Magna Carta\u2019s 800th birthday, the UK prime minister, David Cameron, celebrated the text as a symbol of \u201cliberty, justice, democracy [and] the rule of law\u201d. \u201cAll over the world, people are still struggling to live by the rule of law and to see their governments subject to that law. The countries that have these things tend to be the long-term successes. Those who don\u2019t tend to be the long-term failures,\u201d he said. Experts say such ideas will be low on the agenda when Xi\u2019s state visit begins next Tuesday. The British chancellor, George Osborne, recently vowed to make Britain China\u2019s \u201cbest partner in the west\u201d and activists accuse London of falling silent on Beijing\u2019s human rights record to avoid damaging business ties.  Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat in China and the author of a forthcoming book on Xi, said Britain\u2019s China policy was clearly being dictated by the Treasury, with thorny issues such as human rights pushed to one side. \u201c[Xi Jinping\u2019s visit] is going to be remorseless and relentlessly about parting the Chinese and their money. That is really what we are interested in,\u201d Brown said, pointing to plans for Chinese investment in British nuclear power plants and infrastructure. China expects Britain to roll out the red carpet during Xi\u2019s visit next week, which involves events in London and Manchester.    #MagnaCarta 800 Global Tour arrives in #China next week.

Whereas I, in dirty noisy Mexico City, and no mortgage or rent to pay, have 10 GBP of monthly expenses for my housing, for water, electricity and gas. That gives me an enormous freedom. (Martin Thulin)      Traffic in Mexico City. Photograph: Herv Hughes/Hemis/Corbis     The main thing that affects my stress level is just constant jostling. Jostling on trains, tubes, buses, on escalators, crossing roads, pedestrian crossings, lifts, at lunch time, in supermarkets, coffee shops, traffic jams etc. It just seems like everyone is in such a rush and pushing other people is just a way of showing how important you are. If we all relaxed we\u2019d get there 2 minutes later but happier. (PrakashShah)   Stress, in cities, is all about self-preservation. You have to keep on jumping out of the way of traffic or people. If the vehicle traffic factor can be eliminated from city life, then stress is substantially reduced. Open space is absolutely essential for reduction in stress, depression and so on. (spitnswordus)   Pace of life, sense of claustrophobia (lack of space), lack of greenery, crowds, pollution, constant consumer lifestyle, being constantly under the scrutiny of strangers, the weariness of dealing with many strangers; as soon as I escape to the countryside I feel much lighter and happier. (Mikesh Patel)   I find that big cities suck away the ability to think truly independently. Too many people, too many other thoughts and things being said which interfere with one\u2019s own creativity. (hogarth1)  Although others disagree:  I\u2019ve found the exact opposite to be the case. I knocked out several bestsellers while sitting on the balcony of my old apartment in the middle of Bangkok, but put me in the countryside and my brain turns to mush. (KeithTaylor)      Traffic in Jakarta. Photograph: Donal Husni/Demotix/Corbis    Which cities are stressful \u2013 and which aren\u2019t?  I lived in Cairo (Zamelek, Mohandiseen) for a year. Even on night trips on the near-deserted airport road, taxi drivers used to sound their horns every thirty seconds or so, with no traffic anywhere near. I asked the driver why drivers used their horns so much. He replied that most (i.e. all except rich) Caireans were born and raised in noise, with traffic, cheap, dense housing and hearing the neighbours through the walls. He said it was almost like breathing for him and that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable without noise.  I left on a summers day to relocate to Madrid, the city half-empty, the other half at the beach. Peace, quiet, green spaces; a different world. When the locals complain about the traffic, I suggest they take a few days out of Europe for a comparison. (mrunderhll)   Jakarta for me, just for the traffic, was mind-boggling! (Maharaja Brovinda Singh)   The worst city I have ever been to has got to be Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. There are no pavements, footpaths, no walkways or flyovers for pedestrians. The roads are constantly congested with countless cars and trucks. No one follows the rules of the roads, there are so many traffic accidents that I would lose count going to and from work. (Filmitsonshine)      Traffic in Riyadh. Photograph: Alamy     The most stressful place I have ever lived is Singapore, without a doubt. People have no concept of allowing others to pass beside them on the footpath \u2013 assuming you can find a spare inch on the footpath amongst the teeming hordes; traffic is rampant, the MRT always overcrowded, nobody looks where they\u2019re going because they are too busy reading phones, noise of traffic and strange food smells, stifling heat and commercial pressure from advertising everywhere. (eggbert17)   Zero mention of street harassment in Cairo, which any woman will tell you is by far the biggest stressor there. Any of us would take double the pollution, traffic and noise put together in exchange for a reduction in harassment, which studies have shown affects 97% of women on a regular basis. (TrulyMadlyAmanda)   My memories of commuting in London revolve around running. I would leave my home in a north London council estate at five to seven and sprint to the nearest bus stop that was about half a mile away. I would just catch the bus which took me to the station, jump off the bus before the stop and sprint up the hill to the station and leap down the stairs to the 7:14 which would be just about to depart. I would arrive in St Pancras station at 7:30.  I would then sprint through the station and bound down the countless number of stairs into the underground labyrinth that is Kings Cross/St Pancras station and catch a Metropolitan Line train to Bromley by Bow, catch me breath before sprinting out of the station down St Leonards Road to the factory gate (it was quicker to run than take the bus) and I\u2019d clock in at 7:58. Stressed? I would be if I did it today. (Old_Lion)      Commuters at Kings Cross tube station. Photograph: David Levene     I lived in Shanghai for six months and it was not stressful. Why? Because a subway rail station is never far away. And the trains are every 3 minutes. Terribly different in Manila. The 3 distinct lines do not share the same interchange stations. It\u2019s a 20 minute walk between stations to change lines. (mediashit)   Malta isn\u2019t in the same league as Cairo and Mumbai but it\u2019s poorly developed and jammed with traffic, very noisy. There\u2019s little greenery so, having moved there recently, I\u2019m hoping the sea takes some of the stress out of living there. (simonsaint)   I would cite Vancouver as one of the least stressful cities I have ever visited. Wonderfully situated between mountains and the sea with good urban spaces, and easy access to walks, and the sea. (BigBear2)   I didn\u2019t detect a lot of stress in Copenhagen. I then came back to London and instantly felt my heart tense up and my brain hurt. I have decided there is an optimum size for a city and it\u2019s a heck of a lot smaller than 8.5 million people ... At 500,000 people and a metro area of circa 1.5 million, Copenhagen is clean, works like clockwork and makes London look like the dirty, miserable heaving mass it is. (boomblastandruin)      Less stress? The waterfront of Nyhavn Canal in Copenhagen. Photograph: Alamy     I\u2019d suggest Copenhagen is a city which has relatively lower levels of stress. Yes it\u2019s small, with the highest taxes and not much cheap coffee, but the bigger things which have been proven to combat long-term stress can be found \u2013 a high-degree of economic equality, high levels of trust as well as frequent socialising in groups. There are also lots of superficial factors that lead to lower stress: easier commutes (biking), green spaces and independent shops over large chains (helps a place not feel anonymous, perhaps). This isn\u2019t a city possible to be replicated everywhere, but I think it\u2019s an interesting example of how cities in Europe and beyond could take ideas from in future urban planning. (Alice Barker)   I\u2019ve commuted on the Central Line in London at 7.30am many times. Sure, it\u2019s crowded, but it\u2019s fast, efficient, and it gets you across town pretty quickly to where you want to go. Everyone on the train realises we are all in the same boat, and people are generally considerate. Let me tell you that waiting at a suburban station in Sydney for 45 minutes for the next train is far more aggravating than moving swiftly through a tunnel towards your destination, even if it is crowded for 20 minutes until you get past Bank. (yoghurt2)   Even within cities there are areas which cause greater stress than others; in the three years since my workplace shifted from the Aldwych to the bustle of Oxford Street my stress levels have risen and my health has declined. I miss the refuges of calm, the Temple fountain, Somerset House, Embankment Garden, places where a 10 minute break resets the adrenalin counter for the day. (Horatio93)      Rural peace: the Lake District. Photograph: Robert Harding Picture Library L/Alamy    Time to escape? Many suggested the cure to all this urban stress was, by definition, relocating to be surrounded by nature in the countryside:  I have a house in the countryside surrounded by woods and mountains. Nearest neighbour is half a mile away. I just spent five days there, taking photos of the nature and listening rain drops on the leaves and drainpipe. (pfcbg)  But others disagreed:  I just escaped the countryside after 12 years and am delightedly gulping in diesel fumes. Never again!

It was never going to be enough and, having staved off break points in his opening service game, he would not hold again until the sixth game of the second set.

Djokovic was sublime, just as he has been throughout a year that has brought three grand slam titles, 13 straight finals and 72 wins from 77 matches. As the Serb showed with the sliced backhands and frequent forays to the net with which he tormented Murray, his game has evolved, eclipsing even the dauntingly high benchmark he set in 2011, when he also won three of the four majors.

Xi, a feared strongman who some say is China\u2019s most authoritarian leader since Mao, is likely to grab most of the headlines during the couple\u2019s stay at Buckingham Palace. But for years it has been Peng, not Xi, who has hogged the limelight, thanks to her career as a globetrotting folksinger who has graced stages from New York to Vienna.  \u201cShe is a complete star,\u201d says Kerry Brown, the author of CEO, China: The Rise of Xi Jinping. Peng \u2013 or Mama Peng as some fans know her \u2013 is often compared to Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the French-Italian singer married to France\u2019s former president Nicholas Sarkozy. Others have drawn parallels with Raisa Gorbachev, Michelle Obama, Jackie Kennedy, Samantha Cameron and the Duchess of Cambridge, with whom Peng will dine at a state banquet on Tuesday. In fact, Peng\u2019s levels of domestic stardom are closer to those of Mariah Carey, even if her songs contain more than a hint of Mao Zedong. \u201cHey, who is going to help us turn over a new leaf? Who is going to liberate us?\u201d the soprano, who is also a major general in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, croons on one track. \u201cIt\u2019s the dear PLA.

Advance!\u201d  Peng Liyuan was born in east China\u2019s Shandong province in 1962, the eldest of three children. She joined the PLA in 1980 and, musically gifted, was admitted to the prestigious China Conservatory of Music in Beijing. In 1983 the army singer was catapulted to national celebrity after performing on China\u2019s CCTV New Year\u2019s Gala, an annual television extravaganza watched by millions. During the 80s and 90s, the pop sensation cemented her status as a household name, touring the nation performing her soaring and patriotic vocals. And in 1986 Peng met Xi Jinping \u2013 then a mid-ranking official whose first marriage to the daughter of China\u2019s ambassador to Britain had fallen apart \u2013 on a blind date. \u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d she recalled in a 2011 interview. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the ideal husband for me? A simple man with his own ideas.\u201d The couple married the following year and had a daughter, Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University last year. Chinese propaganda depicts Peng as a pop idol of the people. \u201cOver more than three decades, she has given hundreds of free performances for people from all walks of life across the country,\u201d an official biography says, pointing to performances at remote oil fields, mines and deserts. Fang Ying, a record producer who worked with China\u2019s first lady for more than two decades, says her success is the fruit of a rare musical talent and charm. \u201cShe is a very graceful, frank and kind person,\u201d she says. \u201cHer voice, her training and her understanding of art are all impeccable. She is the unmatchable zenith of China\u2019s contemporary vocal music.\u201d Zhang Tianwei, a fashion writer, says Peng is also a style icon whose clothes are designed by Jihong Mao, China\u2019s answer to the royal dressmaker Sir Norman Hartnell. \u201cShe is the perfect representation of the modern Chinese woman.\u201d But there is more to China\u2019s first lady than music and glamour. In his recent book about Xi, the China scholar Willy Lam argues that Peng was instrumental in her husband\u2019s rise to power. During the 90s she used her military connections to introduce him to the influential \u201cchieftains\u201d of the Communist party\u2019s Shanghai faction, lead by the then president Jiang Zemin. That introduction, Lam says, helped Xi land his first job as a provincial Communist party chief in the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang in 2002. Within a decade Peng\u2019s \u201csimple\u201d date would reach the pinnacle of the Communist party, becoming one of the most powerful men on earth.  \u201cPeng has great political savvy,\u201d Lam says. He describes her as both a \u201cnational heartthrob\u201d and \u201cXi\u2019s secret weapon\u201d. Brown says the singer\u2019s fame and network mean she is now \u201can extremely important player in the power politics of China\u201d. \u201cI think she is a sincere believer in the party and its ambition to create this strong, powerful, rich China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think she is a very fervent nationalist. Her songs are almost all about the importance of a strong China and a renaissance for China.\u201d State media describe Peng as a key soft power tool. Her foreign trips are a chance \u201cto show her personal glamour and charisma, as well as that of China\u201d to the world.  But many believe Peng\u2019s star qualities are being squandered, with her overseas appearances heavily scripted and largely low profile. Brown says propaganda chiefs fear China\u2019s most prominent first lady since the Mao era might eclipse her husband. \u201cShe is a very seasoned TV performer and singer and she knows exactly how to play the crowd,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a great asset if you are a political culture that is confident with this kind of display but obviously to Chinese leaders this is a new thing.\u201d   Related: Spotlight is likely to be kept off China's next first lady    Party spin doctors will be particularly cautious about Peng\u2019s appearances in Britain, he says, after Xi was upstaged by the Pope during his state visit to the US.  \u201cThe last thing the Chinese government and Xi Jinping want is for the front pages to be dominated by her and for his great leadership not to get the coverage they feel it merits.\u201d Officials in Beijing are tightlipped when asked what role Peng will play in this week\u2019s visit.

Related: Chinese economic slowdown or a slow rebalancing?    The fall in China\u2019s growth rate, which compared to annual expansion of 7% in the previous quarter, follows a dramatic drop in trade that has reverberated across the world.  An overheated property market in the country has prompted a contraction in construction output while the manufacturing sector has slumped as exports slumped.  The decline in heavy industry and construction has depressed demand for oil, iron ore and other commodities, dragging on growth in Australia, Brazil and other supplier countries. In recent weeks, the US Federal Reserve shelved plans for an interest rate rise, while the European Central Bank has been forced to consider launching a second stimulus package this year. Such is the persistent weakness in demand at home and abroad, China\u2019s combined exports and imports fell 8.1% in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2014, well below the full-year official target of 6% growth. Although it was slightly better than economists expected, the 6.9% growth rate was the slowest since the 6.2% recorded in the first quarter of 2009, during the global recession. Oxford Economics, an independent forecaster, said it cut its forecast for world economic growth to 2.5% for 2015 and 2.7% for 2016, down from 2.6% and 3% respectively in June. It said the chances of 2016 being the year when the global recovery regained momentum were now \u201cmeagre\u201d.

Some analysts said the true growth rate was likely to be exaggerated by official figures and has persistently languished below 4% all year, only being kept near the 7% government target by pressure from Beijing.  Yet the latest dip was still seen as the first official confirmation of investors\u2019 fears about economic growth since a Chinese stock market slump and surprise currency devaluation in July and August. The communist government has reacted to the slowing economy with a raft of measures since last November, when it began to cut interest rates.

Osborne envisions China as the UK\u2019s second largest trading partner after the US by 2025.  More UK products are making their way to China than ever before, with 4.8% of British goods exported there in 2014, up from 1.3% in 2004. However, this is still considerably behind the US (12.8%), Germany (10.6%) and the Netherlands (7.9%).   Goods exports   But while exports elsewhere have flatlined, those to China continue to grow.   China export growth   UK imports from China have increased a lot faster than exports. Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the Asian country in 2014 was \u00a319.5m. When only looking at goods, that figure increases to \u00a322.5m, which is second only in the world to Germany.   Chinese trade surplus   Part of the way to change that is to make Britain a place that it is easier for Chinese companies to trade with. On his trade mission to China in 2013, David Cameron said that French and German language classes should be snubbed in favour of Mandarin. The number of pupils taking Chinese GCSE has begun to increase again after a drop off in 2012, which was largely due to many switching to the alternative ICGSE qualification.

Chinese daily analyses Xi Jinping meeting with Labour leader", "article": "As the strongman president of the world\u2019s second largest economy took centre stage on the first day of Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to Britain, one Chinese newspaper asked its reporters to investigate a supporting actor: the 66-year-old Labour party leader and MP for Islington North, Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cWho is Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d wondered the Southern Metropolis Daily, one of Guangdong province\u2019s top newspapers. \u201cWhy is China\u2019s head of state meeting the opposition leader during his UK visit? Is it common practice, or does it carry deeper meaning?\u201d     The front page of the Southern Metropolis Daily. The text under the main headline asks why Xi Jinping was meeting Jeremy Corbyn.    Corbyn had vowed to raise concerns over Beijing\u2019s human rights record with Xi during their meeting at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The Labour party said the pair had a \u201ccordial and constructive\u201d encounter. There was no mention of any discussion of human rights in China, where an army of Communist party censors stands ready to extirpate any mention of such topics from the media. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, issued a meagre two-paragraph summary of the Xi-Corbyn summit. \u201cXi Jinping noted the special role played by the Labour party in UK political life, and said he would like to see more cooperation with the party,\u201d it said. \u201cJeremy Corbyn said China has made huge achievements in helping more than 600 million of its people out of poverty.\u201d With an intensifying government crackdown on dissent under way in China, the Southern Metropolis Daily also steered clear of mentioning human rights. Instead, it offered readers a potted biography of Labour\u2019s leader \u2013 born in Wiltshire in 1949, the year Chairman Mao took power \u2013 and sought to explain why Xi might have wanted to meet him in the first place. Li Guanjie, a researcher from Shanghai International Studies University, suggested one answer might be a political affinity between Xi, who has sought to revive the study of Marxism in China, and Corbyn, who has described Marx as \u201ca fascinating figure\u201d. Li told the newspaper \u201cthe reason why President Xi Jinping was meeting the newly-elected opposition leader could be that Corbyn\u2019s ideas about socialism and the working class are similar to the ideology of our country\u2019s ruling party\u201d. \u201cWhen Britain became the first western power to recognise the legal status of the People\u2019s Republic of China [in 1950] it was Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour party that was in government,\u201d the newspaper added. The Southern Metropolis Daily noted that Labour \u201cheavyweights\u201d such as Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had opposed the election of a man it called \u201cLabour\u2019s famous old lefty\u201d. More controversially, in one-party China, the newspaper also sought to explain the multi-party democracy in which Corbyn is now a key player. \u201cThe main responsibility of the opposition party is to scrutinise the behaviour of the ruling party,\u201d it said.

And for good reason. As the influence of league tables grows on prospective students, their parents, policymakers and the wider public, universities are keen to celebrate their rise, or defend their fall, in an increasingly competitive higher education environment. Debates continue about the merits and methodologies of such ranking exercises. Stephen Curry wrote recently in the Guardian about the margins of error involved, and argued that rankers should \u201cexplicitly acknowledge the uncertainties in their tables of aggregate scores.\u201d  Another challenge posed by the power of rankings is that they encourage a cookie-cutter approach to university strategy. Fundamental questions of purpose and priorities are effectively outsourced to the number crunchers at the Times Higher or Shanghai Jiao Tong.  Against this backdrop, it is a brave institution which sets out to reinvent itself. But one university that has tried to forge a distinctive path over the past decade is Arizona State (ASU), under the leadership of its president Michael Crow. In a recent book, Designing the New American University, Crow and co-author William Dabars describe the \u201cexhaustive reconceptualization\u201d of ASU that occurred from 2002 onwards, as it changed from a \u201clargely undifferentiated regional public university\u201d into an \u201cinstitution that combines accessibility\u2026.inclusiveness\u2026and maximum societal impact.\u201d  Crow and Dabars rail against a higher education sector they see as full of copycat institutions, hemmed in by routine, standardisation, inertia and conformity. Over 300 pages, they set out their journey towards a different model, in which traditional discipline-based departments have been replaced with more problem-orientated transdisciplinary structures, such as the School of Earth and Space Exploration, which includes engineers and computer scientists, or the School of Human Evolution and Social Change, where anthropologists sit alongside mathematicians, political scientists and epidemiologists. As these reforms have taken root, they argue, ASU has benefited from funders\u2019 preference for cross-disciplinary approaches. From 2003 to 2012, ASU\u2019s federally-funded research portfolio grew by 162 per cent, significantly outpacing increases in most of their peer institutions.  ASU\u2019s charter calls for the university to be measured \u201cnot by whom its excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed\u201d. This commitment to ensuring Arizonian students from diverse and under-represented backgrounds gain access has led to an impressive 38.3 per cent increase in student numbers from 2002 to 2013 (from 55,491 to 76,771), with minority enrolment up 124 percent over this period. Research efforts have also been directed towards the needs of the citizens of Arizona, through initiatives to improve the air quality in Phoenix, and increase the number of locally qualified teachers. Crow and Dabars argue that ASU\u2019s model ensures that it is held accountable as a \u201cpublic good\u201d for its contribution to the economic, social and cultural health and wellbeing of its community.  Of course, ASU is not without its critics. Some argue that the university has achieved mixed results in terms of its academic outputs, while others question the uniqueness of its structures, given that aspects of traditional departments still lurk beneath the surface of newer, interdisciplinary units. And ironically in a book that lambasts conformity in the sector, Crow and Dabars fall back at various points on improvements in ASU\u2019s league table performance as evidence for its success. This sits awkwardly with their call for new and differentiated models of universities \u201cthat more squarely address the needs of the nation in the twenty-first century.\u201d  Minor quibbles aside, it is refreshing to hear at first hand from a university leader who is so willing to articulate and pursue a radical public and social agenda. Of course, Arizona is very different from Aston or Aberdeen, but this is a book that should be read and debated by vice-chancellors and university managers in the UK. As Geoff Mulgan, chief executive of Nesta, has argued, universities are surprisingly poor at applying principles of research and innovation to their own operations, and their policies are too often poorly evidenced and tested. We should not allow the annual merry-go-round of league tables and rankings to overshadow more fundamental debates about what and who universities are for, and the kinds of social transformation they should be aiming to achieve. If Crow has designed the \u2018new American university\u2019, who will be game enough to attempt its British equivalent?

Appearing side-by-side with Xi in Downing Street, the prime minister used a short press conference to brush aside concerns about working so closely with an undemocratic nation to announce unprecedented cooperation on sensitive issues of security. \u201cI\u2019m clear that the UK is China\u2019s best partner in the west,\u201d he said. Cameron said that the cyber agreement is a first step towards wider potential security cooperation between China and the UK, in which each country will agree not to condone or conduct spying on each other\u2019s intellectual property and confidential corporate information. GCHQ has reported \u201cdisturbing\u201d levels of cyber-attacks on British companies, which are thought mostly to originate in China and Russia. The deal also mirrors one agreed between China and the US last month, but which the American monitoring group CrowdStrike believes was violated almost immediately.  As Cameron hailed a new relationship between the countries, Xi struck a conciliatory tone as he said his country is ready to increase cooperation over the difficult issue of human rights. \u201cComing to the human rights issue, China attaches create importance to human rights. We have found a path suited to China\u2019s conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is always room for improvement in the world. China is ready to increase co-operation with UK and other countries over human rights.\u201d Xi also mounted a defence of China\u2019s steel strategy against accusations it is dumping cut-price product on the market, which UK steelmakers have blamed for forcing them to close and mothball plants. \u201cI want to answer the steel question. The world is seeing an oversupply [of steel] following the financial crisis. China also has overcapacity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have taken a series of steps [to remedy this]. We have cut 700m tonnes of production capacity. You can imagine the task of finding jobs for those workers.\u201d The president made the comments after UK journalists were allowed a single question to each leader, allowing the BBC to press him on why the British public should be pleased about such a high level of cooperation with a country that has a deeply troubling record on human rights. Cameron was also asked how a steelmaker who had lost their job might feel about the pomp and extravagance accorded to the Chinese president, when the country stands accused of helping fuel the crisis in the British steel industry. The prime minister responded with a forthright defence of the UK\u2019s decision to push for closer ties with China. \u201cI reject the [premise] that you either have a conversation on human rights and steel or you have a strong relationship. I want both,\u201d he said. Downing Street confirmed Cameron raised the issue of human rights with China, which has been condemned internationally by campaign groups over the detention of hundreds of its critics earlier this year. However, Cameron\u2019s official spokeswoman refused to say how he approached the subject, whether he raised the plight of any particular people, and even whether the discussions lasted for longer than a minute. Earlier, Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and activist who has in the past been detained by his government, suggested Cameron was being too accommodating on the issue of human rights.           Xi Jinping: world has room for improvement on human rights    \u201cI think the British prime minister has had a record on putting human rights aside which is very bad strategy and also is a very bad aesthetics, because this certainly doesn\u2019t represent the British people,\u201d he told Sky.  Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International, said Xi\u2019s comments about improving human rights were welcome but \u201ca considerable understatement\u201d. \u201cWith more executions taking place in China than the rest of the world put together, with lawyers and human rights activists being arrested and disappeared, and with even the most modest forms of dissent being severely punished, the Chinese president should be promising wholesale human rights reform,\u201d she said. The talks focused on trade and foreign affairs, with the two countries discussing the potential for common ground on Syria in a conversation that is set to continue at Chequers on Thursday. The UK is thought to be seeking to persuade China not to vote in tandem with Russia at the UN as global leaders seek a resolution in the war-torn nation that does not involve Bashar Al-Assad. The flagship announcement is a \u00a36bn investment by a Chinese state company in the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset, which is due to be built by around 2025. However, there were numerous other deals, including more than \u00a312bn of oil and gas ventures. The biggest of these is a $10bn deal for Britain\u2019s BP to supply China\u2019s state owned power station, Huadian, with liquefied natural gas.

The Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point was questioned on national security grounds by Admiral Lord West \u2013 who served as a minister under Gordon Brown.  \u201cI do have very real concerns looking to the future in terms of security,\u201d said West, a former head of the navy and a counter-terrorism minister.

It is expected that \u00a330bn worth of trade deals will be struck during the Chinese president Xi Jinping\u2019s UK visit this week, and much of it has been happening among sprawling city models and virtual fly-throughs of glistening new towers.

But the primary focus was on London, where some of China\u2019s largest property developers are well on the way to realising plans for buildings of an unprecedented scale of ambition and level of luxury.

The Shanghai-based developer Greenland was also here to showcase its \u00a31.2bn investment in London property, including plans for \u201cclassic south-west London luxury apartments\u201d on the eight-acre Ram Brewery site in Wandsworth, and what could be the tallest apartment building in western Europe at Canary Wharf. Designed by HOK, Hertsmere House will rise to 67 storeys, if it receives planning permission, putting it at the same height as One Canada Square, the tallest building in Canary Wharf. Its 869 apartments will be some of the most expensive in London, but critics have raised concerns over the building\u2019s deep, dark floor-plates and the fact that the plans don\u2019t meet London\u2019s Housing Design Guide standards. Only 80 flats will be for social rent, while 80 will be intermediate, again falling short of the borough\u2019s requirements.

Most of these places will sit empty, so it\u2019s doing nothing to help the housing crisis \u2013 where 20,000 people are on the waiting list for social housing in Tower Hamlets alone.\u201d Last year, Chinese nationals were granted the most tier 1 investor visas by the UK, which fast-tracks the immigration process for those who want to invest more than \u00a31m in the country, meaning Chinese investors overtook Russians for the first time. Property experts say the wave of Chinese investment in London\u2019s property market is driven by a combination of the recent slowdown of China\u2019s economy and a slackening of restrictions on the amount of money that can be invested overseas, combined with the prestige of having projects in London. \u201cThe top Chinese developers are being driven by challenges in the domestic market and global branding needs,\u201d says Eric Zhao, a Chinese markets specialist at Savills. \u201cCompanies are beginning to diversify their huge capital outside of China after the restriction on overseas investment was lifted by the regulator. We have already seen the top Chinese firms make a statement in London and we are expecting more to follow.\u201d And it\u2019s not just the luxury residential sector that is catching their attention.

He was eventually persuaded on the grounds that it could double as a research trip for his Bond novels (he was on his seventh by this stage). \u201cEven if people can\u2019t put up with James Bond and those fancy heroines of yours, they seem to like the exotic backgrounds,\u201d Fleming recalled his editor telling him, in the introduction to Thrilling Cities \u2013 the book that came out of those travels.

Related: Spectre review: James Bond is back, stylish, camp and sexily pro-Snowden    That list will sound familiar to 007 aficionados. They\u2019ve all found their way on to Bond\u2019s itinerary, and many more besides. In his 50-year service, Bond has visited nearly 50 countries, real and fictional. He clocks up a few more air miles in the forthcoming Spectre, visiting London, Austria, Rome, Morocco and Mexico. Fleming\u2019s editor was right: those \u201cexotic backgrounds\u201d are as indispensable a part of the Bond formula as vodka martinis, product placement and female silhouettes wiggling suggestively over the title sequence. For most of his movie life, Bond had the first-class departure lounges of the world pretty much to himself, but times have changed. This year we\u2019ve already seen Tom Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt doing dangerous foreign spy stuff in many of the same places Spectre visits. Imagine the awkwardness at passport control when Hunt and Bond realised they had used the same secret travel agent. Jason Bourne was probably hiding out in Starbucks till they had gone.     Location, location, location \u2026 Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead in Sceptre. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists    The departure gates are now rammed with Hollywood film crews, it seems. As well as Cruise\u2019s Mission Impossible, this year so far we have already witnessed the following: a maverick gang of California car thieves taking arbitrary detours to Japan, Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi (Furious 7); a Central American dinosaur park with an Indian CEO, a Chinese scientist and a French-African sidekick (Irrfan Khan, BD Wong and Omar Sy in Jurassic World); Marvel superheroes fighting it out on the streets of Johannesburg, Seoul and \u201ceastern Europe\u201d (Avengers: Age of Ultron); a multi-ethnic Nasa crew rescuing an astronaut with the help of the Chinese (The Martian). We\u2019ve even had an American actor pretending to be French (The Walk). It used to be that Hollywood only left US borders as a last resort \u2013 when the location scouts failed to find a bit of Arizona that looked enough like downtown Baghdad, say \u2013 but now it\u2019s engaging with \u201cabroad\u201d with an almost missionary zeal. But pretty much everywhere movies go today, they\u2019re following in Bond\u2019s footsteps. Fleming\u2019s creation was an internationalist from the outset. Bond studied oriental languages at Cambridge. He is fluent in French and German, we are told, and in the movies we\u2019ve also heard him speak Italian (he has a few lines of it in Spectre), Spanish, Greek, Russian, Arabic, and he\u2019s learning Danish in Tomorrow Never Dies \u2013 \u201cYou always were a cunning linguist, James,\u201d Moneypenny coos. Bond came on to the scene just as Britain\u2019s empire and influence was on the wane. His escapades helped to sustain the impression that Britain was still a significant global player, both in geopolitics and the movies. You could say that he is British cinema\u2019s equivalent of Trident.     Furious 7. Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock    But now it is Hollywood that finds its global power on the wane. Twenty years ago, the US accounted for 70% of the global movie box office, the rest of the world the other 30%. Today it is the other way around. The international box office has grown by 33% in the past five years alone, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Territories such as Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Malaysia are booming, and eclipsing them all is China, which is on track to overtake the US as the world\u2019s largest film market by 2019. Traditional Hollywood wisdom used to be that to score a blockbuster you needed to appeal to the \u201cfour quadrants\u201d: male and female, young and old. But that\u2019s no longer enough. Now you\u2019ve also got to factor in that your audience is primarily non-American, and might not be all that interested in, say, the finer points of California law enforcement or the mating habits of Manhattan yuppies. Failure to connect with that global audience can spell the difference between commercial success and failure. In fact, it can make successes of films that previously would have been failures. So movies that don\u2019t travel, don\u2019t travel. Could we call this global factor a \u201cfifth quadrant\u201d? It sounds like the title of a third-rate sci-fi movie, which is probably about right. A good example of where that five-quadrant logic can get you would be the highest-grossing movie of 2014: Transformers: Age of Extinction. Part four of Michael Bay\u2019s robot franchise was universally slated by critics for its baffling plot convolutions, special-effects overkill and general aversion to subtlety, yet it was the only release last year to make more than US$1bn. Tellingly, just 22.5% of that came from the US, the lowest proportion of any movie in last year\u2019s top 30 according to Box Office Mojo. By contrast, Age of Extinction made more than $300m in China, a national box-office record at the time.   \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Location, location, location \u2026 Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation. Photograph: Bo Bridges/AP    Age of Extinction\u2019s appeal to Chinese viewers is obvious. The entire second half of the movie takes place in Beijing and Hong Kong. There are small roles for Chinese actors, including Li Bingbing and champion boxer Zou Shiming (who knocks out an American spook). What\u2019s more, the bad guys are shady US corporations and CIA operatives (and Decepticons, of course). The Chinese authorities are the good guys. A naval commander even appeals to \u201ccentral government\u201d forces to protect Hong Kong from marauding robots \u2013 even as real-life Hong Kong citizens were taking to the streets to protest against China\u2019s \u201ccentral government\u201d. Making concessions to China is now standard procedure in five-quadrant Hollywood, whether by parachuting in Chinese cast members or snipping out elements potentially distasteful to local censors (don\u2019t expect a remake of Kundun any time soon). Recent China-panderers include Iron Man 3 (a baddie called The Mandarin? It\u2019s OK, he\u2019s British), X-Men: Days of Future Past, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, World War Z, right up to The Martian. It\u2019s not just China. Hollywood is now hamstrung by the sum of the world\u2019s taboos. Religious would-be blockbusters such as Noah and Exodus: Gods and Kings were banned in several Muslim countries. Russia doesn\u2019t like anything negative about its history either (it banned Tom Hardy movie Child 44, about a Soviet serial killer, earlier this year). Sexual, homosexual, horror and gross-out content are deal-breakers in many territories. As a measure of how surreal this self-censorship has become, consider how earlier this year Sony chickened out of releasing The Interview in the US for fear that North Korea would retaliate to a comedy assassination of its supreme leader with nukes as well as cyber-attacks. It\u2019s doubtful Pyongyang really was behind the notorious Sony hack, but when you can\u2019t even laugh at North Korea, something has really changed. Studios have been getting more blockbuster-heavy, making fewer, more expensive movies than ever before. The risk per movie has therefore increased; as has the desire to eliminate it \u2013 which means more rigorous calculations about how a movie will \u201cplay\u201d to all sectors. Making a blockbuster is now like manufacturing a luxury car \u2013 something that is researched and focus-grouped and marketing-strategised from every angle for every territory. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make a good blockbuster of course, but stretching into the horizon is a production slate of inoffensive, apolitical, un-challenging, franchise movies: superheroes, space operas, spies, monsters, even Transformers has sequels and spin-offs planned for the next decade. Welcome to the fifth quadrant.     Casino Royale. Photograph: United Artists/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    There are signs, however, that audiences are getting fed up with this. Tellingly, the highest-grossing movie of 2014 in the US was not Transformers (that came seventh), but Clint Eastwood\u2019s American Sniper, which focused tightly on the courage and anguish of the most prolific sharpshooter in US military history, played by Bradley Cooper. Iraqis\u2019 suffering or the wisdom of US foreign policy were well out of the movie\u2019s crosshairs, and it was condemned by many foreign critics as blinkered, jingoistic and borderline offensive. American Sniper was only the 13th-highest earner of 2014 worldwide. It took 65% of its $346m gross in the US. All of which suggests that there is an American audience who yearn for movies that speak directly to them, rather than globalised Hollywood product. Maybe only a grizzled old-Hollywood veteran such as Eastwood has the authority to say: \u201cScrew the numbers, I\u2019m making a movie for my country.\u201d The Bond franchise has always been careful to strike the right balance between playing to the home crowd and appealing internationally \u2013 which is why Skyfall is now the highest-grossing film of all time in the UK. Bond movies fly the flag and champion British values (or at least British merchandise) like no others \u2013 even to the extent of escorting the Queen to London\u2019s Olympic opening ceremony. But they have always been outward-looking, too. Initially, that was towards the US. Goldfinger featured American locations and was the first Bond movie to get a proper promotional US campaign, and became the highest-grossing film of 1964. Thunderball did even better in 1966. Adjusting for inflation, both movies did far better than Skyfall, and arguably ushered in the blockbuster era a decade before Jaws. In recent years, Bond\u2019s focus has shifted towards Asia. John Cleese, Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Q, let slip in 2014 that the franchise ditched its sense of humour as it never played well with Asian audiences. Skyfall also did its share of China-appeasing. Bond visited Macau and Shanghai in the movie (technically it was a sound stage in Pinewood, but hey), but in order to secure that all-important China release, it had to excise scenes showing the murder of a Chinese security guard (Chinese security guards are too good at their jobs for that to happen), and references to state torture and prostitution. Bond was originally a cold war combatant but he is more often wrapped up in personal issues these days \u2013 which conveniently take him to photogenic tourist locations rather than geopolitical hotspots. There is nothing in Spectre to upset our friends in China, the US, or even North Korea.           Watch a video review of Spectre    Like Ian Fleming, Bond is actually a terrible sightseer. In terms of Brits abroad, he is more at the Jeremy Clarkson/Prince Philip end of the spectrum. Show him a precious cultural site and he will most likely drive a car or a motorbike or a tank through it. Venetian palazzos, Egyptian ruins, Russian city centres, Turkish souks \u2013 all have perished as a result of Bond\u2019s vandalism. The only \u201csights\u201d Bond is really interested in are bars and casinos. And when it comes to engaging with the locals, he rarely goes beyond shooting foreign men and shagging foreign women. It is a similar story in Spectre. He is only at Mexico City\u2019s spectacular Day of the Dead parade to chase down a suspect, with a few historic buildings as collateral damage (careful, Bond, it is an emerging market!). And the repair bills stack up as he continues through the Austrian Alps, Morocco and London. It is all undeniably hugely entertaining, and Bond\u2019s cultural sensitivity has progressed considerably since Fleming\u2019s heyday, but they are not likely to name any airports after him. But if Bond isn\u2019t much of an ambassador for the new, globalised moviescape, who is? On the upside, you could say Hollywood is making some amends for its Borat-like ignorance of decades past, and that respect for, or at least acknowledgement of, other cultures, nationalities and ethnicities can only be a good thing. But more often than not, there is still a white male in charge, and the rest of the world is mere exotic background. Bond blazed the trail, but his followers haven\u2019t quite shaken off his, and Fleming\u2019s, imperialist snobbery. There is a lot more travelling to do. Spectre is released in the UK on 26 October.

It\u2019s a question I get asked on a weekly basis (the restaurant one, not the children) and, just as regularly, the answer will change. But for every different response, the reasons they\u2019re my favourites remain the same. And it\u2019s not because of cheffy showing off or experimentation, the perfection of the linen or the opulence of the decor. The key determinant is: would I go back? It surprises me how many times \u2013 even after a technically flawless meal \u2013 the answer to my own question is to shake my head: nope. Restaurants are about far more than the cooking. (I\u2019d never say I was a food critic; my job is restaurant reviewer.) In some of the restaurants on this list, the food isn\u2019t the main draw by any stretch of the imagination. But would I go back tomorrow, and the tomorrow after that? Yes, please. Even after 15 years of doing this gig (plus 10 years of actually working in restaurants), when I wake up in the morning knowing I\u2019m off out to lunch, I feel uplifted and excited, and immensely privileged that I get to do this for a living. Once upon a time, I used to scour Michelin, especially when travelling, enduring many a hushed, clenched room and dishes where red peppers were tortured to look like Mondrians. This has caused a bit of an allergy to the stressy, tweezered school of cuisine, so I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t find many multi-course tasting menus here. (There are a couple, but they\u2019re the work of chefs who understand the term \u2018hospitality\u2019, and still see food as a joy, a pleasure, rather than an opportunity to waggle their appendages.) I\u2019m sorry if your favourite isn\u2019t here, and I apologise in advance to Wales, Birmingham, Auchenshuggle. These are my favourite restaurants, not the UK\u2019s best, or the country\u2019s top, or any other such arbitrary listicle. Yes, my choices may be London-heavy, but do bear in mind that a) I do not live there, and b) it\u2019s simply where the highest concentration of good restaurants in the UK is to be found. (If I\u2019d been allowed out of the UK, you would be reading about the likes of Joe Beef in Montreal, Cibus in Puglia and the Swan Oyster Depot in San Francisco.) And because I visit incognito, I get the same experience you would: no rolling out the red carpet, no special treatment or extra little freebies. My favourites may not suit your purposes if you want to crunch deals in an atmosphere designed for Masters of the Universe. Or to stand in line for hours with nothing to show for it but a meat sandwich that takes 30 seconds to eat. Or spray yourself orange and dance on tables (yes, STK, I\u2019m looking at you). But the more restaurants I eat in, the more I\u2019m devoted to those that send me out into the night thinking not \u2018I wonder how the chef got the foraged sea asters to do that?\u2019 but \u2018That was top fun\u2019.  My favourite places are those where staff look genuinely pleased to see you, where there\u2019s a buzz of contented customers, where the menu gives you a little thrill because there are so many things on it that you\u2019d like to eat. And where you always fancy just the one more glass from an alluring, ungreedy wine list. I\u2019m afraid I no longer much care about Michelin and The World\u2019s 50 Best, nor do I particularly worry about lack of upholstery in the seating (I\u2019m furnished with plenty of my own padding). But in each of the restaurants I talk about here, I can say \u2013 with hand on heart \u2013 I\u2019ve had a really, really good time.

But while the Second City continues to gorge itself on burgers, this beautiful, family-run former warehouse and \u2013 yes \u2013 timberyard continues to plough its own merry furrow to haunting and hugely satisfying effect. The malted sourdough and whipped bone marrow butter that kick off proceedings are a ballsy statement of intent, and everything that arrives afterwards \u2013 \u201cbite\u201d, \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cmain\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d \u2013 will raise eyebrows and smiles in equal measure. I\u2019m particularly impressed with chef Ben Radford\u2019s way with meat, taking fine Scottish produce and letting it sing, avoiding water baths and other culinary footerings. But he\u2019s a wow with the lighter things in life, too: sodas flavoured with wild things, dishes scented with lovage or elderberry, or scattered with woodruff, sea buckthorn or fluffy, sharp Crowdie cheese. Add to that Timberyard\u2019s policy of aiming to achieve zero waste (they grow a lot of their own greens and herbs), a wonderful hidden interior courtyard where you can sit with tartan rugs over knees and an in-house butchery, and you get something very special indeed. And the cocktails \u2013 from a list on which charred tomato jostles with noble fir, burnt birch bark, even bone marrow \u2013 are simply not to be missed. Rogano     \u2018A long-standing seafood joint that cracks out classics with aplomb.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo Macleod    11 Exchange Place, Glasgow G1, 0141-248 4055, roganoglasgow.comThere was a period of my life when I basically lived in the Rogano, a walnut booth in its beautiful, art-deco interior pressed into service as office, living room and occasionally \u2013 after a martini or several \u2013 very nearly bedroom. The lobster bristling on the perfectly preserved Vitrolite exterior lets you know that seafood is the name of the game here. It was originally an oyster bar, and you can still prop up the bar necking the bivalves \u2013 plain or Rockefeller or, with dangerous modernity, fried in polenta. But the greatest treat for me was being able to afford the restaurant proper, for classic fish soup with rouille and croutons, and \u2013 oh! \u2013 lobster thermidor. With chips, of course. On a recent visit, the exterior had sadly sprouted a \u201cterrace\u201d that was enthusiastically colonised by smokers. But inside it\u2019s as seductively of another time as ever. And the rosy langoustines as yielding and sweet. I always thought Rogano was one of those vintage entertainment palace names, like Alhambra, Locarno, Gaumont, but apparently it\u2019s the elision of the name of the original owner, Mr Roger, with \u201cANOther\u201d silent partner. Love this. Maybe one of these days, if I go back often enough, I might even score the legendary Table 16. Inver     \u2018The Isle of Bute lamb served at Inver will be probably some of the finest you\u2019ve ever eaten.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Strachlachan, Strachur, Argyll &amp; Bute, 01369 860537What a location \u2013 this place has the sort of view over loch and castle that tourist boards dream of. And in this whitewashed former croft in Argyll, the team of chef Pam Brunton and front-of-house Rob Latimer are delivering cooking that\u2019s every bit as dramatic as the panorama. You can sit in the little bar and eat crab fished from those Loch Fyne waters and served simply with homemade sourdough and hand-churned butter. Or call by (unlikely, given its remoteness) for fresh scones, cookies and coffee in the afternoon, nabbing one of the outdoor benches to breathe in the cool, clean air. But dinner in the pale, Nordic-looking dining room with its wood fire is a real event, worth travelling over hill and dale for. Perhaps there might be a slab of purest white Gigha halibut served with a tangle of acidulated potato, a clever and delicious play on fish and chips; or that old stalwart of scallops with black pudding reinvented as a black pudding bun with raw scallop nestling at its centre. Isle of Bute lamb will probably be some of the finest you\u2019ve ever eaten \u2013 swoonworthy. Dishes might be scattered with wild herbs, meadowsweet and scurvy grass, pea tendrils, wild garlic, or delicate flowers, all collected by the team. A wee beauty. La Parmigiana 447 Great Western Road, Glasgow G12, 0141-334 0686Chef and owner Sandro Giovanizzi can\u2019t be said to be one of the world\u2019s great kitchen innovators \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure that the menu served when they opened in 1978 would look pretty much like the one on offer today \u2013 but that\u2019s not what La Parmigiana is all about. It\u2019s about comfort, familiarity, the knowledge that the fine elastic pasta for the trademark lobster ravioli will be homemade with free-range eggs and Italian 00 flour, the little parcels stuffed to bursting with shellfish, the creamy sauce rich with their shells. And that the beef will be finest Scottish, as will the salmon, but the technique will be purest Italian. The snug, red walls have welcomed lots of stars over the years \u2013 I love the photos of the likes of Lionel Richie and Sex And The City\u2019s Kim Cattrall on the website \u2013 but the restaurant quietly goes about the business of turning happy customers into regulars who\u2019ll come back time and time again. Senior staff treat old and young with equal grace. The small restaurant has been the setting for more O\u2019Loughlin family parties than any other, the most recent for a 90-year-old who\u2019s sadly no longer with us. He had a wonderful time. North Sticky Walnut     Sticky Walnut: \u2018Good simplicity is notoriously difficult to achieve.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    11 Charles Street, Hoole, Chester, 01244 400400Chef/owner Gary Usher may have stood down from his perch as funniest chef on Twitter (a shame, because his uncensored rants, from lacerating soul-searching to lambasting the \u201cconosurs\u201d on TripAdvisor, was one of social media\u2019s top diversions), but his delicious, plainly decorated two-storey bistro in Hoole garners new fans daily. Usher is typically self-deprecating about the food that comes out of his kitchen, insisting that it\u2019s simple stuff. But good simplicity is notoriously difficult to achieve \u2013 there\u2019s no hiding place \u2013 and his team carry it off every time. Fluffy foccaccia with a seductive, oily crust; fine meat \u2013 lesser-loved cuts such as shin, maybe, or Jacob\u2019s ladder, or pig\u2019s cheeks, slow-braised into spoonable tenderness. The eponymous \u201csticky walnuts\u201d served with roast baby beets, spicy pumpkin seeds and fresh goat\u2019s curd are now poshly named \u201cwalnut praline\u201d, but they\u2019re still there. Game is a real strength, and I could develop a serious habit for their blue-cheese arancini. Usher successfully crowdfunded a baby Sticky, called Burnt Truffle, in the Wirral, and rumour has it that he\u2019s looking at opening Sticky Mk III in Manchester. If so, lucky Manchester. House of Tides     House of Tides: \u2018Pulls off that rare trick of making high-end cuisine truly accessible.\u2019 Photograph: Rebecca Lupton for the Guardian    28-30 The Close, Newcastle NE1, 0191-230 3720A lovely, historical riverfront building, an inspiring chef (Kenny Atkinson), creativity and excellent produce aplenty: House of Tides is a real north-eastern star. The original tasting-menu-only option has now been augmented with two- and three-course options, making it truly accessible. Brief dish descriptions \u2013 \u201cpeas, pine nuts, chives\u201d \u2013 belie the delicious intricacy of the dishes. Van Zeller 8 Montpellier Street, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 01423 508762,It was during a riotously greedy trip around God\u2019s Own Country that I first came across Tom Van Zeller\u2019s small Harrogate restaurant. Of all the places I visited, it\u2019s this one I\u2019m drawn back to \u2013 despite it being far, far away from my own back yard. In a boutique-lined street in the city\u2019s pretty Montpellier Quarter, it doesn\u2019t look like much at first, especially compared with some of Yorkshire\u2019s other culinary stars, who go in for cosy tradition and open fires in a big way. But the restrained, monochrome interior allows Van Zeller\u2019s creativity to shine where it belongs: on the plates. One of his menu stalwarts \u2013 rabbit, marmalade, carrot, soil \u2013 is a bucolic romp on a plain white dish: endless iterations of the root vegetable, pickled, raw, cooked; the most delicate, tender bunny; a \u201csoil\u201d made from dark, fragrant mushrooms. It\u2019s a genuine classic, and one I\u2019m happy to rave about any opportunity I get. Newer dishes are delicate and complex \u2013 chicken wings with scallops, cauliflower and truffle; or the richness of smoked eel given freshness and zing by cucumber, chervil, apple and goat\u2019s curd \u2013 without losing sight of that essential deliciousness. And, yes, they\u2019re beautiful. I may not give much of a damn about Michelin stars, but with his thoughtful, intricate cooking, Tom Van Zeller clearly does. Why he isn\u2019t tripping over the things is beyond me. The Man Behind The Curtain 68-78 Vicar Lane, Leeds LS1, 0113 243 2376He calls himself Hair Metal Chef on Twitter, a nod to gorgeously eccentric Michael O\u2019Hare\u2019s silver-aproned, rock\u2019n\u2019roll style. In a loft-like space above designer clothes shop Flannels, O\u2019Hare crafts his idiosyncratic dishes: a punky approach to haute cuisine. Despite the artistry, he never loses sight of the need for food to taste fantastic. Siam Smiles     Siam Smiles: \u2018An Asian food store in Manchester that just happens to serve brilliant Thai food on the side.\u2019 Photograph: Rebecca Lupton for the Guardian    48a George Street, Manchester M1, 0161-237 1555A supermarket in Manchester\u2019s Chinatown is the unlikely setting for some of the most authentic-tasting, vibrant Thai cooking I\u2019ve had in the UK. The kitchen\u2019s forte is noodles, lovely, wriggly noodles with plenty of bite in broths shimmering with gardens\u2019 worth of herbs. They might brim with pokey Thai chillies, pink shallots, even pig\u2019s blood. The owners regularly fly in produce from Thailand, fresh peppercorns almost juicy with citrussy fire, lime leaves, morning glory, stink beans, pea aubergines, and Chef May makes fine use of them. In case the vivid flavours aren\u2019t enough for you, tables are laden with condiments: white pepper, crushed peanuts, tamarind, chilli vinegar. But that\u2019s for the hardcore \u2013 anyone needing more spicing clearly has a palate of purest asbestos. Even sticky rice is wonderful (I\u2019m not damning with faint praise: it\u2019s tricky to get right), perfect for bunching into balls and dabbing into the sour-sweet-hot sauces or for soothing the burn from punchy, fermented pork sausages. If you\u2019re lucky, there might be red duck curry on the menu, the paste heroically Technicolor in flavour. Siam Smiles is family-run, and the care and love they pour into each dish makes us customers feel like family, too. Lunya 18\u201320 College Lane, Liverpool L1, 0151-706 9770 This sprawling deli-meets-tapas bar serves some of the best Spanish produce to a devoted local crowd. Ceilings sprout first-class hams and sausages, many of which can be eaten in the brick-walled restaurant. Owner Peter Kinsella calls it \u201cCatalan fusion\u201d (gambas pil pil might come with vanilla; bacalao spring rolls; a lush arroz negro; very unSpanishly, they have a vegan menu, too), while Catalan scouse, laced with chorizo piccante and morcilla, is surely as fusion as it gets. Volta     Volta: \u2018Everything you\u2019d want from a neighbourhood joint.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    167 Burton Road, West Didsbury, Manchester M20, 0161-448 8887Along West Didsbury\u2019s strip, it\u2019s hard to throw a move without hitting a cool little hostelry or bistro. Despite being unnaturally drawn to the notorious Crazy Wendy\u2019s Thai, Volta is my favourite: everything you\u2019d want from a neighborhood joint, plus a whole lot of rackety fun besides. Some of that racketiness is possibly down to the fact that it\u2019s owned by the DJ duo known as the Unabombers \u2013 Luke Cowdray and Justin Crawford \u2013 who serve food influenced by their world travels. So the menu could feature the likes of purple sprouting broccoli fried with shallot and chilli; monkfish ceviche in a coconut-enriched leche de tigre; lamb chops grilled with Lebanese spices; juniper-and-orange-smoked duck with giant couscous and pickled mushrooms. There\u2019s always a board groaning with good charcuterie, with house pickles and fine bread from Trove in Levenshulme. It\u2019s a cute little place, a bit battered around the edges, but in a decorative way. There\u2019s a great drinks list and rare-breed roasts on a Sunday. The streetside terrace is a year-long party. Staff are lovely, too, and understand the concept of hospitality. The Reliance 76-78 North Street, Leeds LS2, 0113-295 6060 They make their own charcuterie at this raw-boned, striking boozer. Top stuff it is, too: velvety, scented with fennel, glistening with fat, and so good the city\u2019s excellent charcuterie bar Friends of Ham stocks it. The rest of the menu isn\u2019t to be sniffed at, either: the kitchen turns out food you want to eat, from the simple (Yorkshire pork sausages with mash and gravy) to the special (pigeon breast with charred spring onion and pomegranate molasses). Much more than a pub, the Reli is a fine eating house, one with heart and soul. South Bell\u2019s Diner     Bell\u2019s Diner: \u2018Has settled into a formula of being simply excellent.\u2019 Photograph: Sam Frost for the Guardian    1-3 York Road, Montpelier, Bristol BS6, 0117 924 0357A Bristol stalwart throughout many incarnations, Bell\u2019s has now settled on being, simply, excellent. The corner site, with its vintage furnishings and series of little rooms, oozes charm. If it\u2019s on the regularly changing menu \u2013 I described it as \u201cModern Brit with touches of Moro\u201d \u2013 the lamb Sainte M\u00e9nehould (fried, breaded breast with a vibrant herb sauce) should always be ordered. And an unusually fine wine list rewards enthusiastic exploration. An offshoot, Bellita, opened last week. 64 Degrees 53 Meeting House Lane, Brighton, 01273 770115I like to pull a stool up to the counter at tiny (just 20-odd covers) 64 Degrees in the Brighton Lanes and work my way through everything on the menu between two of us. It\u2019s easy to do: the menu is short and the dishes small, but both punch far above their weight. Terse menu descriptions \u2013 lobster, wasabi, lime; mackerel, gooseberry, elderflower, cucumber; grouse breast, greengage, bread sauce \u2013 belie the sophistication of technique and the sheer thwack of flavour teased into every dish. This is a kitchen working at the top of its powers: the menu changes with dizzying regularity, and there\u2019s something to dazzle and thrill each time you go. Chef Michael Bremner runs his minuscule empire with energy and enthusiasm, and a Nutty Professor\u2019s cupboard full of sophisticated kit, used to alluring effect to dehydrate kimchi for serving with sticky, addictive chicken wings crowned with a blue cheese foam, or to create discs of ethereal, savoury jelly. The gummy bear dessert, if it\u2019s on, is a showstopper. I\u2019ve no idea why their second outlet in central London didn\u2019t last, but I\u2019m inclined to blame the burghers of Pimlico, rather than this electrifyingly entertaining little number. JoJo\u2019s 2 Herne Bay Road, Tankerton, Kent, 01227 274591JoJo\u2019s hasn\u2019t missed a beat since moving from a tiny main street restaurant to this handsome seafront building with plenty of alfresco tables. Produce is Kentish \u2013 especially the pristine fish \u2013 but flavours are Mediterranean: smoky grilled sardines, sharp with lemon and black pepper, excellent salumi and embutidos, mutton and feta koftas, mixed meze. Sadly, it\u2019s no longer BYO (they used to add extra corkage if wine came from Tesco). Pump Street Bakery 1 Pump Street, Orford, Suffolk, 01394 459829 This stripped-back little outfit is justifiably renowned for its baking, but a lunch at the cafe \u2013 Orford-smoked salmon on home-baked Montreal bagel, maybe, or pulled pork and buttermilk coleslaw on a brioche bun \u2013 offers sheer pleasure (especially on a sunny outdoor table). I once went to a party here and woke up the next morning with my bag full of their sausage rolls. I\u2019m happy to report they were every bit as glorious a day later. LONDON Brawn  49 Columbia Road, London E2, 020-7729 5692A former small-industrial building \u2013 high ceilings, open kitchen, vast windows \u2013 Brawn is a looker with the sort of bones that mean it doesn\u2019t need to try too hard. But both its understated beauty and the apparent simplicity of the menu belie the kitchen\u2019s real commitment to deliciousness: punctilious sourcing, a passion for ingredients, real technique. Their pannacotta is the finest I\u2019ve tasted, and what they do with vegetables, duck, lesser-loved cuts of meat\u2026 A newly re-found favourite for me \u2013 the sort of place I\u2019d go to weekly, if I could. Rules     Rules: \u2018The perfect location for pretending you\u2019re landed gentry.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    35 Maiden Lane, London WC2, 020-7836 5314 As we speak, I\u2019ve just booked a table here, for grouse. Rules comes roaring into its own in game season, its opulent, red-velvet-and-gilt grandeur the perfect location for pretending you\u2019re landed gentry. I couldn\u2019t love this restaurant more as the nights grow chill and, at Christmas, it is simply the ideal place to avoid any thoughts of shopping over a gallon or two of claret and perhaps an overstuffed, offal-rich suet pudding. Maybe under a tinsel-bedecked portrait of Maggie Thatcher. As London\u2019s oldest restaurant, Rules gets its fair share of the grown-up, wealthier tourist trade (last time I went, I collided with original supermodel Janice Dickinson), but it\u2019s still home to real Londoners, many of whom look as though they\u2019ve taken a brief hiatus from starring in a Punch cartoon. Two great Rules secrets: 1) the bar \u2013 the martinis are among the best in the capital, but I\u2019m not telling you how to find it, because it is mine, I tell you; and 2) it\u2019s open all day, right through from midday to midnight. Grouse at 4pm, then game chips, p\u00e2t\u00e9 and port, before rolling home to an early bed, preferably tucked in by Nanny. They\u2019re not afraid to have a cocktail that\u2019s dedicated to Kate Middleton; Rules is old enough to be above irony. \u201cGame birds may contain lead shot,\u201d they say. It\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take. Jos\u00e9 104 Bermondsey Street, London SE1Probably my favourite seat in the capital is at the window of tapas bar Jos\u00e9 with a glass of something saline and frosty \u2013 a manzanilla from Sanlucar de Barrameda, maybe \u2013 and a plate of purple, glistening, expertly cut Ib\u00e9rico de bellota in front of me. (That it looks out on to another cracker, ultra-bistro Casse-Cro\u00fbte, is just a by-the-way.) This tiny space gets mobbed almost the minute it throws open its doors at noon, so scoring the prime spot feels a real privilege. Most people treat Jos\u00e9 as tapas bars should be treated: grab an Estrella Damm or glass of txacoli, a plate of croquetas (and, when they taste the wonder that are chef Jos\u00e9 Pizarro\u2019s croquetas, immediately order another), and then move on. Me, though, I bed in. As soon as they think they\u2019re getting rid of me, or another punter reckons they might be in line for my perch and gives me the hard stare, I\u2019ll order something else: a wobbly-centred tortilla, crisp-fried hake with allioli, baby chicken with nutty romesco sauce. Anything, really \u2013 it\u2019ll all be gorgeous. Pizarro\u2019s background in the Spanish importers (and now restaurateurs) Brindisa means that the quality is always stellar. Four o\u2019clock in the afternoon is a great time for nabbing a seat. And then just staying there. 40 Maltby Street     40 Maltby Street: \u2018More than just good and frequently verges on stellar.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    40 Maltby Street, London SE1, 020-7237 9247Believe it or not, I love a starched linen tablecloth and Riedel glassware as much as the next restaurant addict. But much of the genuinely interesting cooking these days \u2013 especially from a younger, more impecunious bunch \u2013 comes from places like this corrugated iron-clad railway arch. It\u2019s the warehouse of Gergovie Wines (whose natural wines dominate the list), so they\u2019ve made a virtue of necessity. The kitchen may be the size of a cupboard, but this is \u00fcber-foodie Maltby Street, so if the food weren\u2019t up to snuff, it would rapidly croak its last. It\u2019s more than just good, and frequently verges on stellar. There\u2019s usually a fine, rough terrine \u2013 pork and peppercorn, maybe \u2013 and wonderful croquettes (celeriac, say, or smoked haddock). A tart: fine pastry laden with smoked eel, onion and horseradish. Crayfish cocktail on toast. And they\u2019re not afraid to put on a pie: pork and prune, or venison. Dishes may be humble \u2013 cabbage rolls with pork broth, egg mayonnaise striped with slivers of fierce, salty anchovy \u2013 but they\u2019re always made with an eye towards the consummate pleasure of eating, possibly thanks to chef Stephen Williams\u2019 background in the high-end likes of The Ledbury. I realise that a depressing number of my recommendations say the words, as 40 Maltby Street does, \u201cWe do not take reservations\u201d. I can only apologise. The Manor     The Manor: \u2018Enthralling, sometimes challenging, wildly creative, but always, always a blast.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    148 Clapham Manor Street, London SW4, 020-7720 4662How does chef Robin Gill do it? His mini-empire now stretches to three restaurants \u2013 this, with the original The Dairy down the road and just recently Paradise Garage in Bethnal Green \u2013 yet he\u2019s hit the bullseye every time. His food is enthralling, sometimes challenging, wildly creative, but always, always a blast. Head chef at this cool, artistically scuffed number is Dean Parker, who seems to be every bit as talented as his mentor, teasing vegetables into extraordinary service \u2013 charred-edged celeriac, smoked aubergine whipped with mint, honey-smoked asparagus (they love a good smoking, and fermenting, and pickling) with mead and creme fraiche. I\u2019m a huge fan of the likes of their barbecued chicken skins with own-made kimchi. The tasting menu \u2013 eight courses for \u00a342 \u2013 is so worth doing: it\u2019s a true showcase of the kitchen\u2019s skills. Vegetables, herbs, even honey, can come from their own rooftop garden back at the mothership down the road, and flavours are notably brighter and sprightlier as a result. They make their own sausages and charcuterie. I\u2019d cross oceans for their baked Vacherin with chestnuts and doused in that honey: evidence that the team is happy with luxurious simplicity as well as with culinary pyrotechnics. Those with a sweet tooth will faint with joy at the build-your-own-elaborate-sundae dessert bar. Ciao Bella     Ciao Bella: \u2018May not be the greatest Italian in the capital, but it has the biggest heart.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    86-90 Lamb\u2019s Conduit Street, London WC1, 020-7242 4119Nothing about Ciao Bella suggests that it belongs on any list of restaurant critics\u2019 \u201cbests\u201d, from the website that appears to have been designed in the 1990s to a menu where every hoary old Italian trattoria cliche is alive and bellowing O Sole Mio. But this 30-year-old trouper packs \u2019em in night after night. The terrace (aka tables on the pavement) is busy no matter what the weather. The overwhelming impression \u2013 from the vast risottos, bready pizzas and dishes you thought didn\u2019t exist any more (vitello alla pizzaiola, pollo alla diavola) \u2013 is one of generosity. There\u2019s a resident pianist bashing out Italian \u201cclassics\u201d, and over-refreshed punters are forever joining in. It\u2019s a wonderful place to come with in-laws, or toddlers, or anyone who enjoys the ministrations of jovial, cheesy, super-attentive older waiters. The last time I came here, I had lasagne and chips. Because I could. I once also sat between David Bailey on one side and that Darius from The X Factor on the other. It\u2019s that kind of place: enormous, unselfconscious, old-school fun. Boris Johnson is a fan \u2013 probably something to do with the startling hugeness of portions \u2013 but don\u2019t hold that against it. This is not the greatest Italian restaurant in the capital, but it has the biggest heart. And, of course, enormous pepper mills. Koya Bar  50 Frith Street, London W1I wept hot tears when Koya closed at the start of this summer (I know, I should get a life) when its visionary chef Junya Yamasaki decided to head back to Japan. But Koya Bar next door is holding up remarkably well in his absence, and growing to be, if anything, almost every bit as good. Udon noodles \u2013 fat, snowy-white, with the most haunting chew \u2013 are the most alluring things you can give to your teeth. Legend has it that they\u2019re made the traditional way, by foot. (Yes, foot.) They can come in vast bowls of fragrant broth, or as cold, decorative nests to be unravelled and dunked in soy dips or hot soups. Topped with the frilliest, laciest tempura \u2013 vegetables, or prawns of improbable enormousness \u2013 they become a rare, opulent treat. Koya Bar\u2019s breakfast bowl, heaving with marinated mushrooms, fried egg and bacon, is bloody gorgeous. But there\u2019s so much more than just noodles, especially on the specials blackboard: pristine sashimi, whole deep-fried sole with its crunchy bones, curry and tempura prawn donburi. Little wonder this long, simply decorated room, for counter dining only, has a constant queue outside, something I avoid by going mid-afternoon. The freelance life has to have its perks, and Koya Bar is one of them. Lyle\u2019s     Lyle\u2019s: \u2018Unmistakeably brilliant cooking.\u2019 Photograph: Xavier Girard Lachaine    Tea Building, 56 Shoreditch High Street, London E1, 020-3011 5911I was a bit sniffy about Lyle\u2019s at first \u2013 not because of the unmistakeably brilliant cooking, but because of the set, no-choice dinner menu and its canteen-like demeanour. It was all just a little uncompromising, I huffed. Then I went back for lunch, when you can choose. And went back again. And again. Now that chef James Lowe has relaxed a little, it\u2019s some of the most exciting cooking in the capital. Brunswick House     Brunswick House: \u2018I have fantasies of being found in a corner, covered in cobwebs.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    30 Wandsworth Road, London SW8, 020-7720 2926The restaurant at Brunswick House is one of those places that simply shouldn\u2019t work. But it does, it really does, despite its location, marooned in the middle of the ugly Vauxhaull giratory system, part of the Georgian mansion shared by architectural salvage specialists Lassco. And its decor: Steptoe\u2019s yard crossed with the Marylebone pad of a camp set designer (which I love, obviously). But scratch the surface and the pedigree starts to show: the restaurant is run by Jackson Boxer, grandson of food writer Arabella Boxer, brother to Frank of the famous Peckham car park rooftop cafe specialising in Campari; his father runs an Italian deli not far away. It\u2019s fair to say this is one foodie family. The food is contemporary without being outr\u00e9: a lot of vegetables, treated sympathetically and creatively (a riot of different brassicas on pecan butter; fried pattypan squash with a fonduta of Coolea cheese and lovage oil); off-piste meat cuts (lamb\u2019s tongue with endive, roast top flank with cabbage and nasturtium, spiced sweetbreads with roast corn and grilled onions). I have fantasies of being found in a corner here, covered in cobwebs, a kind of mummified Miss Havisham, having expired after a particularly lavish dinner. Just slightly preserved by the ingestion of several of their very excellent cocktails. Gymkhana 42 Albemarle Street, London W1, 020-3011 5900By no means your neighbourhood curry house, Gymkhana is a swish, special-occasion restaurant \u2013 if you can score a table, that is. It shows that the food of the subcontinent deserves to be celebrated, not dismissed (as we often do in this country) as cheapo beer sponge. Here, it\u2019s raised to a fine art: the freshest spices tempered and sizzled, good wine and fine meat (the duck dosa and muntjac biryani have become must-haves, with good reason), served in an atmosphere of moody, Raj-inspired luxury. Opera Tavern 23 Catherine Street, London WC2, 020-7836 3680Asked what I\u2019d eat for my last meal on Earth, there\u2019s every chance it might have to include the Ib\u00e9rico pork burger from Opera Tavern, a far more complex dish than its terse description suggests. It is gorgeous, as is the bustling restaurant (I like the more informal ground floor best); from the clued-up staff, brilliant wine list and fine, expertly cut hams to the more intricate dishes, it fires on every cylinder. Honey &amp; Co 25a Warren Street, London W1, 020-7388 6175 Just thinking about Honey &amp; Co makes me come over all warm and fuzzy: the husband-and-wife team who run it (Sarit Packer is Itamar Srulovich\u2019s \u201choney\u201d); the tiny, constantly packed restaurant with its shelves of jewel-coloured preserves and lust-inducing cakes and pastries; the cooking, vibrant with Middle Eastern spicing, based on \u201cthe food we grew up on\u2026 our moms\u2019 and aunties\u2019 food\u2026 the things we miss from our childhood\u201d. The sticky Fitzrovia bun, fat with pistachios and sour cherries, is properly life-enhancing. Sweetings 39 Queen Victoria Street, London EC4, 020-7248 3062, no websiteBorn in 1889, wood-panelled fish restaurant Sweetings is supremely masculine, its City location dictating a testosterone-blessed clientele. But there\u2019s also the menu: from the already-buttered bread, to the Dover sole and oysters, to its roster of stodgy, syrupy, custardy, trad-Brit puddings, it\u2019s designed for the chap who loved his nanny (an impression intensified by being ministered to by firm, uniformed matrons). I should hate the place, but it has a curious hold on me: there\u2019s nothing much like it anywhere else. St John Bread &amp; Wine 94-96 Commercial Street, London E1, 020-7251 0848Many would choose the seminal mothership, St John, but I like the more rackety Bread &amp; Wine \u2013 it has less of a pole up its jacksie. As you\u2019d expect, both bread and wine are worth travelling for (as is their celebrated breakfast bacon sandwich): wheels of the legendary St John sourdough stacked up by the open kitchen and a wine list to tickle the fussiest oenophile. Dishes are suitable for sharing, frequently starring creatively spiced vegetables or the perkiest fish. The only restaurant I know to feature elevenses. Seed cake and a glass of Madeira, anyone? Ganapati     Ganapati: \u2018The parathas are a must-order: \u201ca carbphile\u2019s life goal.\u201d\u2019 Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    38 Holly Grove, London SE15, 020-7277 2928 For a long time, people on Twitter just had to bellow \u201cPARATHA!\u201d to me to send me off into a lustful reverie about the flaky, buttery flatbreads at this unassuming little South Indian restaurant in Peckham. They are a carbphile\u2019s life goal. The small, vibrantly coloured restaurant with a vaguely urban-hippy vibe was an early beacon in Peckham\u2019s burgeoning status as a destination for food-lovers; those of us who found it raved with a kind of rabid evangelical fervour. And it hasn\u2019t stumbled since. Concentrating, they tell us, on the \u201chome cooking and street food of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh\u201d, the kitchen delivers in spades. Refreshingly, the menu changes frequently, but there will usually be a generous vegetarian thali, a slow-cooked meat curry \u2013 Keralan-style goat, perhaps, pokey with mustard seed; fish might be seabass fillet or swordfish with ajwain (carom) and smoked tamarind. Homemade pickles are outstandingly vivid, and I\u2019m properly addicted to the crab thoran: masses of crabmeat, chunks of coconut, all thrumming with the fragrance of curry leaves. Oddly, it\u2019s not owned by Indians, but by a Brit, Claire Fisher. Apparently, she opened the restaurant after falling in love with the food of southern India. After a meal here (which must, must, include that paratha), you will, too. Moro     Moro: \u2018It was a pioneer, introducing us to ingredients that have gone on to become mainstream.\u2019 Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Guardian    34-36 Exmouth Market, London EC1, 020-7833 8336Venerable in terms of London\u2019s chomp-\u2019em-up restaurant scene, Moro is ageless and timeless. A pioneer, not only in helping launch foodie mecca Exmouth Market, but also in introducing us to many of the exotic ingredients that shimmer throughout its alluring, Moroccan-Iberian menu: labneh, za\u2019atar, cacik. Morito, its baby tapas bar next door, is also a little star. Kitchen Table 70 Charlotte Street, London W1, 020-7637 7770 Skip the queue for hot dogs and champagne at Bubbledogs, part the heavy curtains at the back and some of London\u2019s most extraordinary cooking awaits. Leather bar stools, only 19 of them, surround a kitchen that\u2019s as much part of the experience as the food. The menu changes frequently, but expect 12 to 14 courses of intricate, adventurous dishes made with flawless produce. I\u2019m normally allergic to the \u201cchef\u2019s table\u201d kind of lark (who knows whom you might end up sitting beside?), but with food this exquisite, an exception has to be made. A Wong     A Wong: \u2018The cooking startles and thrills.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    70 Wilton Road, London SW1, 020-7828 8931How to choose a favourite Chinese restaurant? The delicious eccentricities of the Pengs at Hunan? The sky-high swank and heavenly Beijing duck at Min Jiang? The earthy, sizzling, fatty lamb skewers at grungy little Silk Road? No, it has to be A Wong, on a not particularly lovely road between Pimlico and Victoria, because the eponymous Andrew, who took over his family\u2019s traditional Chinese restaurant, has achieved wonders here, transforming the old warhorse into something chic and contemporary (and not a little clattery), with a menu that startles and thrills. It romps around China, namechecking all corners of the country. The 10-course Taste Of China menu assembles dumplings from Shanghai, Shaanxi\u2019s pulled lamb \u201cburgers\u201d and Yunnan seared beef with chilli and pomegranate into a meal that\u2019s a delicious travel adventure. Dim sum are exquisite: evolved versions of classics \u2013 \u201cBreakfast in Causeway Bay\u201d (Wong\u2019s version of zha leung cheung fun) features sticky rice roll, fried dough stick and \u201clava floss\u201d; and just the thought of the pork bun, with its snowy frosting of sugar, can cause me to emit a small moan of longing. The Forbidden City bar in the basement does equally extraordinary things to cocktails, using fragrant teas and delicate foams, and pairs them with little snacks huge with Asian flavours: Taiwanese popcorn chicken, jellyfish, sweet-and-sour ribs. Barrafina Adelaide Street 10 Adelaide Street, London WC2I worried that, with the opening of their latest outlet in Theatreland, the Hart brothers might be in danger of dimming their tapas bar treasure. I needn\u2019t have: each Barrafina is a little belter. This one \u2013 larger, airier, beautiful in its acres of marble around a bustling central kitchen \u2013 is my favourite. The menu is genius: everything from suckling pig to alluring vegetable dishes (far more than you\u2019d get in actual Spain). Further excitement comes from the daily specials board: mammoth, scarlet carabineros, empanadillas stuffed with wild rabbit, razor clams, tiny delicate tellinas (clams), pig\u2019s trotters. If the crab croquetas are available, they are an essential order: gooey, crisp, thrumming with the rich flavour of the shellfish. The fried squid bocadillo with onion is this branch\u2019s signature: these, with a glass of Palo Cortado sherry or some crisp, gluggable godello, make an absolute feast. If you can stretch to Belondrade y Lurton, you should. I love the new breed of tapas bars (Copita nearly made it on to this list, too, as did El Gato Negro), as dedicated to the quality of the ingredients as to the cooking. This, largely thanks to the small group\u2019s brilliant chef Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho, is the jewel in the crown. 8 Hoxton Square     8 Hoxton Square: \u2018Makes a strong case for being \u2018the perfect neighbourhood restaurant.\u2019 Photograph: Emma Marshall    8 Hoxton Square, London N1, 020-7729 4232, At the risk of being pitchforked outta here, I\u2019m going to tell you that Cameron Emirali, chef and co-owner of 8 Hoxton Square, catered for my wedding. But this is no back-scratching quid pro quo, rather an acknowledgment that now \u2013 as then, at the wonderful Wapping Food (RIP) \u2013 he\u2019s a real talent. This, to me, has everything it takes to be the perfect neighbourhood restaurant: big enough to be buzzy, yet also small enough that they properly get to know their regulars. The wine list is inspired and accessibly priced. There\u2019s a little terrace out front for people-watchers. And the daily-changing menu is a joy: Emirali has the Antipodean\u2019s magpie approach, so you might find the likes of risotto nero, rabbit, morcilla and chickpeas, or veal chop, sprouting broccoli and anchovy. There are creative, unhairshirted vegetarian choices. There\u2019s usually a fine steak, too. Breakfasts are blissful: banana bread with dates, buttermilk waffles with bacon and maple syrup, courgette fritters with peas, fried egg and buffalo ricotta. And I ate one of my favourite ever puddings here: a sticky, moist pistachio cake topped with roast peach, curiously and beautifully scented with tarragon. I also love Emirali\u2019s 10 Greek Street, but this one is just nudging ahead in my affections due to the fact that it takes bookings. In Hoxton! I know. Street Feast I\u2019m using this as shorthand for the extraordinary mushrooming of the street-food phenomenon around the UK, something to be celebrated, not only because it gives young entrepreneurs the chance to launch their menus without massive investment, but also because the best of them inevitably gravitate towards bricks and mortar restaurants with, you know, roofs and heating and licences. See also the excellent Kerb, Altrincham Market and Belgrave Music Hall. Lardo 197-201 Richmond Road, London E8, 020-8985 2683 Eliza Flanagan\u2019s baby, a hymn to everything Italian filtered through a distinctly Hackney lens, continues to delight. Colonising the ground floor of the handsome, vast-windowed Arthaus building, it\u2019s a looker in a rough-and-ready way, softened by colourful cushions and a bobby dazzler of a pizza oven \u2013 less utilitarian kitchen equipment and more glitterball. It\u2019s used to sterling effect on the pizzas and focaccia, but there\u2019s way more to the menu: fine pastas \u2013 you might find pappardelle with wild boar and guanciale, or casarecce with burrata, squash, walnuts and sage \u2013and clever, thoughtful, vegetable-only dishes. The oven belches out great meat, too: just-charred pork chop with endive and wood-roasted potatoes, say, or duck breast with spinach and wild berries. The home-cured salumi are to be treasured, using free-range mangalitsa porkers for the likes of ripe, purple coppa, smoky speck or fennel pollen salami. And the arancini, stuffed with still al dente rice and, perhaps, fiery \u2019nduja, are among the nicest fried things you\u2019ll ever shove down your neck. And those pizzas \u2013 airy and elastic of crust, with deliciously blistered bases \u2013 come with intriguing toppings: black anise pepperoni; zucchini and anchovy; pancetta, provolone and peppers. There\u2019s a terrific brunch, too. Lardo is the kind of place I really wish I lived next door to. Spuntino     Spuntino: \u2018Brings a touch of New York-style grunge to Soho.\u2019 Photograph: Katherine Rose for the Guardian    61 Rupert Street, London W1Russell Norman\u2019s mini empire of hugely influential restaurants is mostly composed of his sorta-Venetian Polpos. But of all of them, it is the grungey little Brooklyn-flavoured Spuntino in the still-seamy part of Soho that I like best: here it\u2019s permanently dusk, the drinks are hardcore, the soundtrack eccentric, the sliders and pizzette addictive, and the macaroni cheese the gooiest and cheesiest in town. Craft     Craft: \u2018It\u2019s clay-baked duck is \u2018one of the country\u2019s most intriguing dishes.\u2019 Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Guardian    Peninsula Square, Greenwich Peninsula, London SE10, 020-8465 5910One word: duck. Pre-order the clay-baked duck \u2013 I\u2019m not afraid to say it\u2019s one of the country\u2019s most intriguing dishes. (It\u2019s so labour-intensive, I\u2019m sure chef and owner Stevie Parle won\u2019t thank me.) But everything on the menu at this dazzling, Tom Dixon-designed complex nudging right up to The O2 (aka The Dome) will be truly rewarding. A gem in an unlikely setting. My top 10(in reverse order) 10 Roti King     Roti King: \u2018Comfort food par excellence.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    40 Doric Way, London NW1 I\u2019m calling it: the roti canai with dhal at Roti King in Euston is the best four quid you\u2019ll spend on food in the UK. You might get bigger food for the money, or dirrrtier or a, er, nice kebab, but this \u00a34 buys you a bowl of richly fragrant, spiced pulses with magical depth of flavour and two Malaysian-style flatbreads. Sure, these are cheap ingredients, but the Roti King, aka \u201cprata-man\u201d (breadmaker) Kalpana Sugendran Sugendran, turns them into things of truly transcendent loveliness. Which is just as well, since his little restaurant is, kindly, no beauty. Sugendran makes the roti in front of you, flipping and stretching the elastic dough in an almost balletic dance until it\u2019s as transparent as chiffon. When your hot breads arrive, their crisp surfaces and squidgy folds make a bread that is one of the capital\u2019s most gorgeous things to sink your teeth into; when a torn-off chunk is dunked through the dhal, we\u2019re talking ambrosial. The other dishes are worth checking out, too: a vast cauldron of coconutty laksa, brimming with noodles, mussels and squid; mutton curry, potent and sombre. But it\u2019s the roti I come for, most recently a solitary visit, all the better to contemplate their glory uninterrupted. Comfort food par excellence. 9 Birch     Birch: \u2018Apparent simplicity disguises painstaking attention to detail.\u2019    47 Raleigh Road, Southville, Bristol BS3 \u201cWe are one half restaurant, one half garden,\u201d says the website for lovely little Birch, in foodie Mecca Bristol\u2019s Southville. In addition to the restaurant, owners chef Sam Leach and FOH partner Beccy Massey have a patch of land \u2013 \u201caround 10 full-size allotments\u201d \u2013 where they grow the produce that ends up on the plate in front of you. The menu changes, it seems, on the turn of a minute hand \u2013 it depends on what\u2019s in season and what\u2019s good: turbot, perhaps, with cider butter and summer vegetables, kid meat \u201cscrumpets\u201d with hot mustard. Gleeful use is made of just-picked herbs and leaves on one hand, and the likes of ox heart or hogget on the other. Ice-creams might be brown bread or wortleberry. This is one of these restaurants where apparent simplicity disguises painstaking attention to detail: gorgeous bread and desserts, a smart, affordable wine list (the owners\u2019 background in the estimable likes of St John and the Quality Chop House shines through). The first time I visited, I said, \u201cI\u2019d give my eye teeth to have this as my local.\u201d My jealousy of its neighbours has not lessened. Leach and Massey built Birch almost from scratch \u2013 this is the classic labour of love. 8 Bob Bob Ricard     Bob Bob Ricard: \u2018It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but I don\u2019t need it to.\u2019 Photograph: KatheKatherine Rose for the Guardian    1 Upper James Street, London W1, 020-3145 1000We all needs a good dose of decadence every now and then. And when I\u2019m in the mood, this eccentric glamourpuss is the only destination. It\u2019s fair to say that when BBR opened, there was a giant chorus of WTF. Critic AA Gill gave it an unprecedented no stars, calling it \u201cGloriously Chronically Unfixably Misbegotten\u201d. Me, I loved it: everything from the David Collins interior that looked like a luxury steampunk railway carriage lined in bookbinding paper to the Farley\u2019s rusk on the menu. Over the years, its bonkersness has been toned down \u2013 the staff no longer have to wear salmon-pink waistcoats or lurex-threaded tweed, sadly; the rusks are no more \u2013 but it\u2019s still a restaurant like no other. The menu is vaguely Russian, with endless varieties of vodka, caviar, potato and mushroom vareniki, even chicken Kiev. But there are British classics, too: an outrageously handsome beef wellington, pies of burnished beauty, a pungent Stinking Bishop souffl\u00e9. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but I don\u2019t need it to. And apart from these marble-lined riches, anywhere that has a button at every table saying \u201cpress for champagne\u201d (\u201ccrapulently pointless\u201d: AA Gill) is OK by me.  7 The Clove Club     The Clove Club: \u2018His food thrills even when he does fried chicken.\u2019    Shoreditch Town Hall, 380 Old Street, London EC1, 020-7729 6496As you enter what was Shoreditch Town Hall, there\u2019s a cold room that looks \u2013 depending on which side of the foodie divide you stand \u2013 like either an axe-murderer\u2019s playroom or sheerest heaven. It\u2019s the building\u2019s former box office, where chef Isaac McHale and his team age homemade rare-breed charcuterie (red wine-cured old spot ventreche, mangalitsa lardo), to be enjoyed in the austerely handsome bar with freshly baked sourdough. McHale paints pictures on the plates with ingredients such as albacore tuna, red pepper and sage; or suckling pig with south Indian spices. But his food thrills even when he does fried chicken: nuggets of the buttermilk-brined bird served with pine salt (exactly what it sounds like) on a nest of pine needles. My only criticism: I always want about three times as much of it. There\u2019s a sophisticated vegetarian menu, too. The last time I ate at the Clove, I had the finest, most fragile cheese tartlets with wild duck and ginger consomm\u00e9 swirled through a decanter of 100-year-old Boal Madeira. No exaggeration, it was celestial. The Clove made waves this year by being the first restaurant here to adopt the Tock system (you pay for a meal \u201cticket\u201d in advance). Controversial, but in an age of tight margins and the rudeness of no-shows, I\u2019d say fair enough. 6 Bocca di Lupo     Bocca di Lupo: \u2018A gem of a joint.\u2019 Photograph: Antonio Olmos    12 Archer Street, London W1, 020-7734 2223 When Jacob Kenedy opened Bocca di Lupo back in 2009, it was an instant smash. The beauty of a British chef paying homage to Italy is the lack of chauvinism: specialities from Liguria nudge famous dishes from Lombardy, Piedmont, Puglia\u2026 the whole gamut, across the 20 regions of Italy. Pastas are stellar: the fluffiest, cloud-like gnocchi; handmade orecchiette sauced with spicy \u2019nduja sausage; spaghetti to which you can choose to add humble mussels or luxurious lobster. But the rest of the menu \u2013 roasts of suckling pig, game when in season, exciting salads \u2013 amply rewards exploration. They make their own excellent bread and ice-creams (a trip to their gelateria Gelupo over the road is a great way to end lunch), even salami and glorious, fat sausages. The all-Italian wine list is a corker. too. \u201cWe are a family business, a humble trattoria\u2026 at heart,\u201d the website says. That \u201cat heart\u201d is significant, because it\u2019s far from humble, one of London\u2019s most glamorous restaurants: the buzzing open kitchen and marble dining counter; dramatic chandeliers; moody oil paintings of food by Kenedy\u2019s mother, artist Haidee Becker. Add the buzz from a local crowd of theatre producers, West End stars, flaneurs and foodies thrilled to score a reservation, and you have a gem of a joint.  5 The Goods Shed     The Goods Shed: \u2018It\u2019s the restaurant equivalent of a hug.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    Station Road West, Canterbury, Kent, 01227 459 153Of every restaurant the length of the country, this is the one you\u2019ll find me in most often: a halfway stop-off between the capital and My Seaside, the restaurant itself handily positioned a 20-second stomp from the station (well, it is a goods shed, after all). In the long, narrow restaurant perched above the farmer\u2019s market, with its brick and soaring windows, chef Rafael Lopez brings his Spanish sensibilities to play on the glorious bounty of Kent. Looking out over the banks of vegetables and fruit, local cheese, bread baked in-house, it\u2019s easy to see why the county\u2019s called the Garden of England. Lopez gets his ingredients from the market, so, depending on the season, his short menu might feature crown prince squash, roast beets, wilted, vivid chard. There are nearly always roast potatoes, fondant in texture with treacly edges. His treatment of fish is glorious: Spain\u2019s beloved hake, perhaps, with a bouillabaisse-rich sauce and mussels; or scallops with chorizo and tiny, fleshy beans, all served on decorative vintage plates. The drinks list stars all sorts of recherch\u00e9 and well-priced lovelies, plus local beer and wine. I\u2019ve never once left hungry or disappointed. (And these days I go for a pre-lunch sharpener cocktail to the Shed\u2019s new little outfit, Wild Goose \u2013 usually something potent with a caramelised chilli on top.) This isn\u2019t ground-breaking, or cool, or edgy \u2013 it\u2019s just the restaurant equivalent of a hug. 4 The Quality Chop House     The Quality Chop House: \u2018How can you not love it?\u2019 Photograph: Patricia Niven    88-94 Farringdon Road, London EC1, 020-7278 1452I find myself here time and time again \u2013 I\u2019m evangelical about the place. I drag people in, forcing them to eat Galloway beef mince on dripping toast, wonderful game served with preternaturally light, luxurious liver parfait, thrilling to the inevitable actual moans of pleasure. Chef Shaun Searley innovates without ever losing sight of deliciousness (or an innate sense of Britishness). So you might be lucky enough to encounter his croquettes made from kid meat, oozing with Tymsboro cheese. (See? Goat on goat: so clever, so good.) There are homemade terrines and roasts, Neal\u2019s Yard cheese, excellent charcuterie. The cult dish is Searley\u2019s confit potatoes, a fried item of evil deliciousness. The wine list is among London\u2019s best; unsurprising, because co-owner Will Lander is the son of wine maven Jancis Robinson. My tip: book in the bar. The restaurant, with its magnificent, original \u201cworking men\u2019s restaurant\u201d wooden booths and tiled floor, should be on the must-see list of anyone interested in restaurants and their history (it\u2019s been around since 1869), but those booths are resistant to the modern person\u2019s posterior; the bar has more accommodating bentwood seating and exactly the same menu. Their butcher\u2019s and deli next door sells sausage rolls by the inch. How can you not love that? 3 Som Saa     Som Saa: \u2018Jan Naem is a strong contender for my Death Row meal.\u2019 Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian    Follow @somsaa_london on Twitter for updatesChef Andy Oliver\u2019s tribute to Thailand was hot stuff, a ramshackle set-up in the archway owned by the Climpson\u2019s coffee roastery, home to some of the finest Thai food you\u2019ll get outside Thailand (and inside, too). The menu is exhilarating: sea bass deep-fried before being blanketed by a perfume factory\u2019s-worth of aromatics; jan naem (fermented pork sausage vibrant with Thai herbs and grilled into stickiness) is a strong contender for my Death Row meal. It\u2019s a bit of a cheat to include Som Saa in this list, because it\u2019s not currently open; but they\u2019re about to launch a crowdfunded permanent site, and I love it, so it has to be here. 2 The Ethicurean     The Ethicurean: \u2018Every visit feels like a celebration.\u2019 Photograph: Jason Ingram    Long Lane, Wrington, Bristol BS40, 01934 863713 Even if it served up curling ham sarnies, the Ethicurean would be worth a visit: it\u2019s set in the enchanting Barley Wood Walled Garden, a perfectly restored Victorian kitchen garden, bursting with fertile life. But far from your usual garden cafe fare, gardener Mark Cox sends his produce to the restaurant in the delightfully scuffed former glasshouse to be made by the team (chef siblings Matthew and Iain Pennington, Paula Zarate and Jack Adair Bevan) into some of the most delicious, innovative, vegetable-focused cuisine in the land. The restaurant, they say, is \u201cfounded on a sense of place\u201d, and that place is just beautiful. There\u2019s a sense of history, too: they celebrate solstices and wassails and ancient British ingredients. But there\u2019s utter modernity alongside: items on the daily-changing menu might include 12-hour pork belly, glazed carrots and anise, kimchi and kohlrabi, or whole, salt-baked celeriac. Their squidgy toffee apple cake served with cinnamon cream is one of the finest desserts I\u2019ve ever rammed into my face. They make an alluring range of tinctures and cordials, among them their own vermouth, made from English wine and herbs from the garden. As the name suggests, there\u2019s a commitment to organic tenets, fair trade, the Rainforest Alliance. It could all be a bit hairshirted and worthy, but it so isn\u2019t: every visit feels like a celebration. 1 The Sportsman     The Sportsman: \u2018The homemade bread is my favourite anywhere on the planet.\u2019 Photograph: Tricia de Courcy Ling    Faversham Road, Seasalter, Whitstable, Kent, 01227 273370I\u2019ve been going to the Sportsman for years, before any of the current brigade of gushing fanboys had ever heard of it, before the Michelin recognition \u2013 astonishing for what has always been, as they describe themselves, a \u201cgrotty rundown pub by the sea\u201d. (It\u2019s not really like that: spartan, yes, but comfortable and welcoming.) I followed the oysters to Whitstable: it turned out to be the gateway drug to what is now a genuine addiction to Stephen Harris\u2019s remarkable cooking. But I\u2019ve never written about it. Until now \u2013 and I\u2019ve got only a measly 200-odd words to tell you about the beauty of everything Harris puts before you, from the glistening local oysters topped with tiny touches of homemade charcuterie that pick up their blissful salinity, to the ice-pops dunked in \u201ccake milk\u201d and the fragile, delicate tartlets that end the meal. About the homemade bread, my favourite anywhere on the planet: especially the magnificent treacly sodabread, with home-churned butter, salted from the sea just outside the door. The white fish in rich vin jaune, the crisp lamb breast with vibrant, vinegary mint. And the unmissable slip sole, delicately meaty in its bath of seaweed butter. Harris is self-taught, a fervent believer in locality \u2013 fortunately Kent is blessed with produce \u2013 and the ultimate enthusiast. On the rare occasions he\u2019s not in his kitchen, he\u2019ll be in the world\u2019s great restaurants, absorbing and learning.

In her memoirs, for example, she hinted that in 1929 she\u2019d come close to nabbing one of the decade\u2019s great female roles: Lola Lola, the bringer of sexual doom to Emil Jannings\u2019 doomed professor The Blue Angel.  One night over dinner with Josef von Sternberg, the film\u2019s director, Riefenstahl happened to mention a cafe meeting she\u2019d once had with a coarse-voiced Berliner, a blonde who had lifted her left breast to show that it was all right for a woman\u2019s d\u00e9collet\u00e9 to sag a little. As Riefenstahl told it, she encouraged Von Sternberg to hire this young woman, named Marlene Dietrich, whose vulgarity was so perfect for a wanton cabaret singer.  Dietrich ended up with the part. As an illustration of her magnanimity, Riefenstahl said she visited the Blue Angel set many times, right up until the day that Dietrich sat down on a barrel and gave cast and crew an unobstructed view up her skirt. Riefenstahl decided to stay away after that.  The trouble with this tale, like so many others from Riefenstahl, is that it\u2019s almost certainly rubbish. In her new dual biography, Dietrich &amp; Riefenstahl: Hollywood, Berlin and a Century in Two Lives, German historian Karin Wieland points out that Riefenstahl\u2019s story doesn\u2019t track all that well with Von Sternberg\u2019s autobiography, where he says only that the Triumph of the Will director occasionally visited his set. Meanwhile, the German critic Hans Feld said Riefenstahl had, for some time, been claiming the role was as good as hers. Then one night, at dinner, a phone call came telling Riefenstahl the role had gone to Dietrich. Riefenstahl, Von Sternberg\u2019s supposed confidante, promptly tossed a hungry Feld out of her flat so she could fume. Dietrich took the rivalry more lightly. When a magazine serialized the Riefenstahl memoir, she wrote a letter to the editor to say that if Von Sternberg were alive, he\u2019d \u201cdie laughing\u201d. She proceeded to spend her life ignoring Riefenstahl.     Riefenstahl walks behind a line-up of Nazi soldiers in Nuremberg, 1935. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images    Wieland is right to lay their lives along parallel tracks. Born within a few months of each other, Dietrich at the end of 1901 and Riefenstahl in mid-1902, they reached adulthood in the same war-shattered Germany. They chose the same industry. The comparison is illuminating, even if the women would no doubt resent having to share the spotlight. A famous photograph shows Dietrich and Riefenstahl at the Berlin Press Ball in 1928, but they seem to need the dazzling barricade of Anna May Wong between them.  Via a fluent, often witty translation by Shelley Frisch, Wieland draws the portrait of women who were ambitious to a degree stunning in their day. Moreover, by tracking their divergent careers together, she is able subtly to suggest some answers to a question that hangs over every mid-century German artist: what kind of responses were available to the Nazi apocalypse? Dietrich was a native Berliner from a military family. After developing tendinitis, she had to abandon her dream of being a concert violinist for acting. For a long while, Dietrich made a living at parts on stage and screen that were little more than decoration. By the time she auditioned for Lola Lola, Von Sternberg said he was impressed by how aloof and indifferent Dietrich seemed. It was, of course, an act. They collaborated on many great films: Morocco, Dishonored, Blonde Venus, Shanghai Express, The Scarlet Empress and The Devil is a Woman. By the time Dietrich went to Hollywood she had long been married to Rudolph \u201cRudi\u201d Sieber, with whom she had her only child, Maria. But Marlene and Rudi had an understanding, essentially that Rudi would stick around while primary breadwinner Dietrich did as she damn well pleased. What pleased her was a string of lovers that can only inspire awe, ranging from German classical actress Elisabeth Bergner to the novelist Erich Maria Remarque (who wrote about their affair in Arch of Triumph).     \u2018A string of lovers that can only inspire awe\u2019: Marlene Dietrich in Morocco. Photograph: Allstar Collection/Cinetext/Sportsphoto Ltd    And the more power the Nazis gained in Germany, the less interest Dietrich had in returning. In 1939, she became an American citizen. She she joined the USO and entertained troops all over Europe. It was no soft tour of duty. The world-famous glamour girl would always recall how, as she slept on the floor of bombed-out buildings while the Battle of the Bulge was fought a few dozen kilometers away, she could feel rats\u2019 frozen feet clambering across her face. Riefenstahl, meanwhile, was experiencing the rise of the Nazis and the onset of war in a far different manner. She had a cosier, more bourgeois background than Dietrich; her father was a plumber who built a large business and had loud, conservative opinions about women who ventured onstage. The young Riefenstahl rebelled by wanting to be a dancer. She performed frequently in what sound like quasi-Isadora Duncan pieces until she too was felled by pain, a knee injury. Riefenstahl then embarked on a career in \u201cmountain movies\u201d, a highly German genre that focused on human attempts to conquer snow, rock, and their own impure natures. While working her way through her own set of lovers that included athletes, numerous cameramen and Jewish producer Harry Sokal (though probably not Adolf Hitler, a point Wieland stresses) Riefenstahl became determined to make her own movies. Her first directorial effort was also her best: The Blue Light, an eerie and symbolic folk tale from 1932, in which Riefenstahl played a mountain girl who tries to protect a trove of glowing blue gemstones in a remote cave. That film attracted the attention of Hitler, whom Riefenstahl swiftly came to admire, and though she later claimed barely to have met him, the evidence shows a friendship that was highly beneficial to the young director. Enraptured by his vision for Germany, she devoured Mein Kampf (she even tried to get Sokal to read it) and threw her lot in with the Nazis as by far the most promising source to finance her art. She made Victory of Faith, a 1933 record of that year\u2019s Nuremberg rally that was a dry run for what will be for ever be her most famous film, Triumph of the Will, the following year. She followed up with the 1938 epic Olympia, about the 1936 games in Berlin.     Leni Riefenstahl, standing with Hitler in 1938. Photograph: AP    Watching Olympia reveals that Riefenstahl\u2019s worshipful treatment of the human form, her use of the camera to track every moment of joy and exertion, influences sports coverage to this day. Triumph of the Will is much harder viewing, knowing as we do what it portends. Still, no other film captures the frenzied worship that had seized Germans as well as that one. What Riefenstahl would never admit was that she couldn\u2019t have recorded that madness so well, had she not shared it. The postwar years were anticlimactic for both women. War gave Dietrich\u2019s performances a darker cast; her characters were cynical and grasping because life had made them that way. Reluctant to ease into character parts, she turned to life as a singer, deciding to \u201ccarry on as a stage legend\u201d, says Wieland. She toured successfully for decades, but the choices she made during the war still had a cost. Beloved through the rest of Europe, when Dietrich played a return tour of Germany, there were protesters; a teenage girl spat in her face. After a brutal spill off a stage in Sydney in the late 1970s, Dietrich retired to her apartment in Paris, refusing all callers and all photographs, even when Judgment at Nuremberg costar Maximilian Schell interviewed her for a documentary called Marlene. She\u2019d been photographed enough, she said, though she still \u201cknew every image, recalled every shot\u201d. Nobody needed to see her at 80, and \u201cthis was not vanity, but an artistic stance,\u201d writes Wieland, an observation that feels exactly right.     Where it all began: Dietrich as Lola in The Blue Angel. Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    Riefenstahl, who was let off the hook with the simple designation of \u201cfellow traveller\u201d after denazification, spent years suing people who alleged she knew about Nazi crimes. She boasted that she won every suit, but the past pursued her, even as she scubadived, or photographed Mick and Bianca Jagger and the Nuba of the Sudan. In our age of ritualised public apology, it is staggering to reflect that not once did Riefenstahl truly say she was sorry for anything, not even for the making of a film called Lowlands, about which she merely expressed \u201cregret\u201d for things she had not known at the time. Lowlands (German title Tiefland) was a film about a dancing Gypsy (Riefenstahl was too old for the part, Wieland acidly notes) who inspires lust in the lord of the manor, but spurns him for a man of the earth. How this project came to occupy Riefenstahl\u2019s wartime energies from 1940 until it limped into mutilated post-war release in 1954 is one of the few stories about her that suggest she wasn\u2019t entirely a sociopath. Riefenstahl was riding along behind the lines as Hitler\u2019s army marched into Poland, tasked with filming the triumph. In a town called Konskie, she witnessed the beating of some two dozen terrified Polish Jews, and it is likely she also saw when they were shot. There are photographs of a stricken-looking Riefenstahl, and for once there are witnesses to back up her claims that she protested to the commanding officer, and asked to be relieved of any obligation to film at the front. But, being Riefenstahl, when retelling this incident years later, she never mentioned that the victims were Jews. (That would have required acknowledging that she knew Jews were being persecuted and murdered, something she denied until she died in 2003 at the age of 101.) And during the filming of Lowlands, she availed herself of Sinti and Roma extras interned nearby. When she was done, they were transported to Auschwitz. She claimed later to have met them all after the war, but of course this was another lie. The presence of the doomed children, applauding her character\u2019s dances, is far more powerful than anything else in Lowlands. Wieland shows that the difference between the two women doesn\u2019t consist merely of choices made and paths not taken. It even goes beyond politics. The frustration of Riefenstahl lies not in her bad qualities, but in her appealing ones. Any consideration of Riefenstahl\u2019s talent, her intelligence, her fearless promiscuity, her pursuit of a then-masculine profession in a hyper-male world, has to be weighed against that blackened hollow in the center.     Riefenstahl (m), directing her film crew for her documentation of the Nazi Nuremberg party day in 1934. Photograph: Friedrich Rohrmann/EPA    Dietrich sometimes showed the selfishness of a star, but she possessed an intrinsic quality \u2013 we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to call it honour \u2013 that Riefenstahl did not. The proof resides throughout Wieland\u2019s book, though possibly it\u2019s crystalised in one single anecdote about Dietrich, from before the war, when most people could not imagine of what the Nazis would be capable. A German production manager flew to London in late 1936 at the behest of the Reich, armed with official letters assuring the star of tax breaks, favourable press, top directors, screenplays and fees \u2013 and as a nostalgic blandishment, a German Christmas tree. Even after the purge of Jewish artists from the once-mighty German film industry, and despite railing against Dietrich in the Nazi-controlled press, they wanted their world-famous star back, and so did Hitler. (The Fuhrer had, says Wieland, loved Dietrich in Shanghai Express.)  Dietrich was in London to see her latest lover, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. She was coming off a dismal flop (Knight Without Armor), she still was having trouble adjusting to directors other than Von Sternberg, and she knew her status in Hollywood was slipping. Marlene\u2019s own mother told the man that Dietrich would see him. There were plenty of reasons to take that meeting. But instead the producer from the Reich \u201csat alone in his London hotel room under the Christmas tree from Berlin and waited in vain\u201d. Dietrich never spoke to him at all.", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Film", "Germany", "Nazism", "Second world war"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-24T11:00:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/24/britains-deals-with-china-billions-what-do-they-mean", "sentences": ["The deals included BBC Worldwide\u2019s co-production deal with Shanghai Media Group to make the sequel to 2007 hit Earth, the feature-length version of the Planet Earth series, due for release in 2017."], "title": "The UK\u2019s deals worth billions with China: what do they really mean?", "article": "Britain\u2019s diplomatic elite has been rushed off its feet catering for the largest contingent of Chinese officials and business executives to arrive in London for 10 years. In 2005, the chief concern was how to contain the noise from protesters angry at Beijing\u2019s occupation of Tibet. This time the Dalai Lama and talk of human rights were kept off the agenda during a four-day visit that David Cameron said was the opening act in a \u201cgolden era\u201d for UK-China relations. In a joint statement, Cameron and President Xi Jinping said they were committed to creating \u201ca global comprehensive strategic partnership for the 21st century,\u201d and exploiting to the full Xi\u2019s \u201cone belt, one road\u201d policy that aims to turn the old Silk Road into a modern trade route across Asia to the Middle East and Europe. However, one comment in particular stood out: when the prime minister hailed \u201cup to \u00a340bn\u201d of trade and investment deals between Britain and China as he attended a trade conference at Mansion House in the City of London. There was some incredulity over how Downing Street had arrived at the number, and No 10 eventually issued a list at the end of Xi\u2019s visit that acknowledged the total included previously announced agreements. Nonetheless, it underlined that the British economy has links with China in many different sectors \u2013 from carmaking to TV programming. But it remains to be seen whether the announcements, analysed below, will amount to a significant trade boost. TRADE LINKS China now represents the UK\u2019s sixth-biggest export market, taking 3.6% of its goods and services. But some analysts characterise Xi\u2019s visit as all one-way traffic, with a grateful Britain buying almost anything China had to offer, from nuclear technology to investment funds for the HS2 rail line, with only a handful of Chinese purchases of UK goods and services going the other way. Critics have also characterised many of the deals as largely symbolic and spread over many years, diminishing their value in the context of overall investment in the UK. But for Xi the willingness of the UK to embrace China is a much-needed fillip as he struggles with an economy suffering from massive overcapacity, especially in the steel, coal and building sectors, where official data suggests factories have the ability to produce up to 30% more than current demand.     David Cameron and Xi talk as they drink a pint of beer at a pub in Princess Risborough near Chequers. Photograph: Andy Rain/AFP/Getty Images    A huge drop in exports and efforts to shift the away from heavy industries to consumer services has also slowed growth to a pace dubbed by Xi as the \u201cnew normal\u201d. And even these lower estimates from the government statistics department could be generous with independent efforts to measure the economy downgrading growth in the last quarter from 6.9% to nearer 4% and an unemployment rate that hovers just above 4% to the dangerously high 10%. Launched in 2013, \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d is Xi\u2019s route out of the malaise. Beijing estimates it will add \u00a31.7tn to China\u2019s trade in the next decade, as it seeks overseas destinations for products that have no home in a saturated domestic market. Britain is one of many such destinations. NUCLEAR The flagship industrial project for the \u201cgolden era\u201d of cooperation is the \u00a36bn investment by China in the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. The British government is relieved that state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation has bailed out the cash-strapped main developer, EDF of France, and promised to take a 33.5% equity stake in the controversial project. The quid pro quo for the Chinese participating, and for providing cash for new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, is to be allowed to build and operate their own facility at Bradwell in Essex. Bradwell will allow the Chinese to trial its Hualong reactor designs in the west and act as a showcase to the rest of the world for its nuclear prowess. New investment money coming into Britain\u2019s creaking energy infrastructure is considered the main UK benefit at a time when over \u00a3100bn is needed to update old power stations and introduce new low-carbon power. EDF has promised that 60% of the contracts at Hinkley will go to the UK although the plant will use a French reactor design, the EPR, and engineering via another French company Areva. British companies such as Laing O\u2019Rourke, Balfour Beatty, and Cavendish Nuclear are in line for significant contracts, with G4S a bidder for security contracts and Somerset Larder for the catering. The biggest boost should be 25,000 new jobs, but the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned last week the UK \u201clacks the necessary construction skills to deliver critical programme such as Hinkley Point.\u201d VISAS AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE Xi made much of the demands from China\u2019s new middle-class consumers for foreign goods and travel. He said that over the next five years, China would import the equivalent of \u00a36.5tn of goods and that 500 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad. To make sure Britain stays on the map, Cameron said that, from January, new visitor visas for Chinese tourists would be valid for two years \u2013 four times the usual six-month limit. He also pledged to match the US government\u2019s latest 10-year multi-entry visa for Chinese tourists at no extra cost. Why single out Chinese tourists for special attention? They contribute \u00a3500m a year to the UK economy, according to the latest figures from VisitBritain and the numbers are increasing rapidly. There was a 35% jump in visitors from China in the year to June on 2014. With every Chinese holidaymaker and business traveller spending on average \u00a32,688 every time they visit, \u201cthe extension of the visitor visa will enable them to maximise their spending power even further,\u201d said Downing Street, adding that every 22 additional Chinese visitors create an additional job in the tourism sector.     Prince William and Xi view an Aston Martin DB10 sports car at Lancaster House in London. Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images    INDUSTRY Low-carbon technology was at the heart of deals struck with China across the automotive sector during Xi\u2019s visit. Aston Martin signed a deal worth \u00a350m with private equity firm China Equity to develop an electric sports car, the Rapide S. The Chinese carmaker Geely, which makes London\u2019s distinctive black cabs, promised to pump in an extra \u00a350m to research and development at an expanded Coventry factory, including the launch of a new fleet of hybrid black cabs capable of zero emissions. And bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis agreed a \u00a3660m deal to build single-decker buses that China\u2019s BYD will equip with batteries to run as electric vehicles. Ian Fletcher at IHS Automotive says even the smaller deals now represent significant investment: \u201cUnfortunately our homegrown industry isn\u2019t as big as it once was, so it\u2019s a feather in the cap. The investment in R&amp;D for a new London taxi does suggest that we still have strengths in engineering in that field: had you said that London Taxi would get a total \u00a3300m investment from abroad five years ago, they\u2019d have said you were mad. Geely do see something in that brand, they are probably eyeing more exports.\u201d Meanwhile, Fletcher says, the injection of funding will be important for Aston Martin. \u201cElectric vehicles are a growing market, but there hasn\u2019t been that much movement at the top end. It\u2019s an opportunity for Aston Martin to become a super-Tesla \u2013 and, with the Chinese government very focused on trying to reduce emissions in their cities, to sell into that market.\u201d CREATIVE INDUSTRIES The UK\u2019s creative and TV production industry struck deals worth more than \u00a3225m with Chinese partners in a flurry of announcements. The deals included BBC Worldwide\u2019s co-production deal with Shanghai Media Group to make the sequel to 2007 hit Earth, the feature-length version of the Planet Earth series, due for release in 2017. It is the first deal completed under the Sino-UK Film co-production treaty ratified earlier this year. Other deals include co-production agreements to make a Chinese version of the BBC series Coast. And Chinese online video company LeTV picked up the broadcast rights to Poldark, while this year\u2019s Sherlock Christmas special will transfer to cinemas across China. Other initiatives include the University of York striking a \u00a3200m TV training programme deal with a Chinese investment group that will involve 300 foreign students a year. While the list of glossy announcements is impressive, China remains a difficult market for UK TV producers to crack. According to indie trade body Pact, sales of British TV shows to China were just \u00a316m last year, with growth of just 1%, down on a 40% surge in 2013. \u201cChina still seems to be mostly a case of a long walk for a short drink,\u201d says one senior executive.     Prince William and Xi Jinping walk past a Doctor Who display at Lancaster House in London. Photograph: Heathcliff O'Malley/AFP/Getty Images    PROPERTY Even before last week\u2019s visit, China had been busy investing in the UK. The country has amassed a huge fortune in foreign reserves from exports, and until the financial crash parked much of it in US Treasury bonds. These days property is the asset of choice, sometimes to the point of investing in apartment blocks that remain empty simply because it is too much hassle to rent them out. Investments in the UK are mainly in London and will soon grab the attention with a development on the river Thames at Nine Elms by Chinese developers Dalian Wanda. The massive towers planned for the area upriver from the Houses of Parliament have already been branded a super-rich playground with flats starting at \u00a31.3m. Cameron was only able to lay claim to a small investment by the Chinese developer Advanced Business Park (ABP) in the \u00a31.7bn Royal Albert Docks scheme as part of Xi\u2019s visit. But the scheme \u2013 also involving fellow Chinese group Citic, which already owns 40% of that site \u2013 is billed as developing a new financial district in east London that will create up to 30,000 jobs. As a signal of intent, it is clear. Beijing wants to take over from the oil-rich Middle Eastern states as the main investor in London\u2019s trophy assets. FINANCE In a deal timed to coincide with Xi\u2019s visit, China\u2019s central bank made its first sale of debt on London\u2019s markets last week, drawing orders of more than 30bn yuan (\u00a33bn). The move is mutually beneficial: it aids China\u2019s drive to make the yuan an international currency, while consolidating London\u2019s position as a global financial centre. The City treasures its reputation as the most international financial centre in the world. It plays host to many more foreign banks than either New York or Tokyo and in recent years added Middle Eastern banks wanting to sell products under sharia law to a list that includes banks from every continent. Last week\u2019s debt sale was not the only example of Sino-British cooperation in finance. In 2014 the China Construction Bank won approval from Beijing to open Europe\u2019s first clearing bank for yuan in London. Later it also started trading in Paris and Frankfurt, but made London its European headquarters. CCB UK, which spent around \u00a3110m on a new headquarters in the Square Mile, processed around 6bn yuan of transactions per day last year. Last week the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that its London trading centre would offer offshore yuan futures, allowing financiers to trade and hedge on movements in China\u2019s currency. The move will bring to London a practice that was previously conducted through Hong Kong.  This article was amended on 30 October 2015 to correct the name of the Nine Elms developer to Dalian Wanda.

His presence in London for the opening of the RA exhibition was something of a surprise. His passport was unexpectedly returned by the Chinese authorities last spring, only for his Instagram account, a frequent source of dire news about his relationship with authority, to reveal that Britain refused to give him a full business visa.  The 20-day tourist visa, not a six-month business visa, was claimed to be on the grounds of an undeclared criminal conviction. Despite his long periods of confinement, Ai had never been formally charged in China, still less convicted.

So, in a public and visible defence of free speech and \u201cpolitical art\u201d, Ai is now creating a \u201cnew work\u201d, organising physical collection points for these donated bricks across different cities. Ai actually used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 of people jailed or exiled for their political activism. The works represented figures from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, and was assembled on the site of San Francisco\u2019s infamous Alcatraz prison. Yet Ai\u2019s work does not address themes of political silencing as a merely intellectual consideration. The Lego boycott adds to his remarkable list of personal censorship experiences. His father was a poet exiled to the Gobi desert during China\u2019s cultural revolution - \u201crehabilitated\u201d only after he\u2019d been forced into the labour of cleaning public lavatories. Political punishment was meted out to Ai\u2019s entire family. At one point they were made to live in a hole in the ground. Ai learned how to make his own bricks in that pit - a skill which may yet come in handy - but was left with feelings towards Chinese authorities once described by this publication as \u201cdeeply equivocal\u201d.   Related: Ai Weiwei: supporters urged to fill collection cars with Lego bricks    As an adult artist, his reputation grew with a notoriety for criticising the Chinese government. Then the 2008 Sichuan earthquake struck. \u201cJerry-built\u201d government schools collapsed and killed thousands of students, many young children. As authorities sought to suppress the scale of the disaster, artworks made by Ai commemorated the lives lost to the disastrous results of government corruption and ineptitude. Ai was the renowned designer of Beijing\u2019s \u201cBird\u2019s Nest\u201d stadium but his official punishment was severe. The government shut down his blog, he was beaten to the point of cerebral haemorrhage then his Shanghai studio was demolished for supposedly lacking a \u201cplanning permit\u201d. In 2011, he was imprisoned, spending 81 days incarcerated amidst world outrage while the Chinese government investigated him for \u201cpornography, bigamy, tax avoidance and foreign currency irregularities\u201d.    The Lego boycott adds to Ai Weiwei's remarkable list of personal censorship experiences.    One suspects his failure to be investigated for bestiality was due only to a lack of imagination in his persecutors. Once released, his passport was confiscated. It was only reinstated this July \u2013 the artist relocated to Berlin to live with his partner and child. Ai was never convicted of a crime, yet this year he struggled to obtain a UK visa for failing to declare non-existent convictions. It took a public uproar there to see the UK\u2019s decision overturned. It\u2019s Ai\u2019s ability to inspire the anti-authoritarian instincts of citizens in democracies; it perhaps explains why the response of Lego to enquiries was so careful. They claimed to \u201ckindly decline\u201d supply when \u201caware that there is a political context\u201d. The statement, of course, a statement that depends on your definition of \u201cpolitical\u201d. For example, Lego were happy to brand-partner with Dutch oil giant Shell, adorning their toys with Shell logos despite the company\u2019s decades of well-known political activities in pursuit of controversial drilling operations in Africa and the Arctic.   Related: Victorians turn out to back Ai Weiwei on free speech, one Lego brick at a time    Environmental campaigners Greenpeace - longtime Shell critics \u2013 had to mobilise a million petition signatures and spectacular public protests before the toymakers felt obliged to drop the co-branding \u2013 and this all occurred only last year. These kind of questionable corporate relationships from Lego lend some credence to insinuations on Ai Weiwei\u2019s Instagram feed that perhaps their refusal of his project order was political in itself, made in order to protect their growing market in China.              And it should say much to Australians if it\u2019s even within the realm of possibility that China can render tremulous a global brand as powerful as Lego for selling children\u2019s toys to but a single one of its dissidents. Lego has inadvertently made censorship of Ai a local story for Australians; Turnbull\u2019s Liberal government \u2013 with Labor\u2019s support \u2013 has just signed the Chafta free trade deal with the same Chinese government that has harassed, imprisoned and ruthlessly censored the internationally-regarded artist.

In winning her 100th senior England cap on Tuesday as Mark Sampson\u2019s side beat Australia 1-0 in a friendly tournament, the 5ft 11in Manchester City midfielder joined an elite club. \u201cTo look at the calibre of players who\u2019ve made 100 appearances, girls like Kelly Smith, Fara Williams and Casey Stoney, it\u2019s amazing to join that list,\u201d says Scott as she braced herself for the long flight back to England and a few days combating the jet lag prompted by an eight-hour time difference. \u201cIt\u2019s Halloween at the weekend so I\u2019ll probably dress up as a vampire \u2013 I\u2019ll look like one anyway after the journey,\u201d jokes the 28-year-old, who senses fate decreed she would reach her milestone in China. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic. It\u2019s a massive honour to get 100 caps and I\u2019m especially pleased for my family and friends who\u2019ve supported me all these years,\u201d she adds. \u201cA lot of people have said it\u2019s a shame it\u2019s happened somewhere they weren\u2019t able to get to but China\u2019s been an important place for me. \u201cI\u2019ve got a small tattoo on my ankle \u2013 it\u2019s a couple of Chinese symbols. They mean \u201csuccess\u201d and I\u2019ve been successful in this country. Playing in the 2007 World Cup here was a big breakthrough for me \u2013 it was a big call on the part of Hope Powell [Sampson\u2019s predecessor] to give me the responsibility she did \u2013 and now this has happened.\u201d By uncanny coincidence the tournament, in which England lost 2-1 to the hosts on Friday before Isobel Christiansen\u2019s winner saw off Australia, clashed with Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to England. At almost any other time of the year Scott would probably have found herself being introduced to the Chinese president and George Osborne when the chancellor took his guest on an escorted tour of Manchester City\u2019s training facilities last week. She and her fellow Lionesses have been much in demand for similar flesh-pressing appearances since England\u2019s success in the summer\u2019s World Cup in Canada, where they exceeded all expectations by reaching the semi-finals and beat Germany in the third-place play-off. Suddenly the boys who mocked Scott for playing football when she was growing up on Wearside are queuing up to have selfies taken alongside her. Still as refreshingly down to earth as ever, she simply takes everything in the long, unerring, stride which, as a teenager, made her a cross-country star with Sunderland Harriers. A subsequent switch to the town\u2019s football team followed by moves to Everton and now City may have swept Scott to the point where David Beckham was delighted to pose alongside her for pictures at Wimbledon in the summer but the route has encompassed plenty of \u201chard yards\u201d. A few were covered in Yongchuan, a part of South-west China capable of making Moncton, the charmingly sleepy town in which England were domiciled for the first part of Canada 2015, seem positively vibrant. Scott and her fellow Lionesses need their caffeine and, back in June, they were frequently found sipping lattes in the coffee shops punctuating Moncton\u2019s Main Street. The last few days have been a little different. \u201cYongchuan\u2019s interesting and this tournament\u2019s been a great experience for us but it\u2019s not Shanghai. We finally found a coffee shop the day before the Australia game,\u201d she says. \u201cWhich was a shame as we could have done with discovering it earlier. A few of the girls have been saying that anyone setting up\u00a0coffee bars here could make a fortune. A business opportunity is being missed.\u201d After almost a decade her England career can probably be mapped through visits to assorted coffee outlets scattered across the globe but Scott struggles to comprehend that she really did win her first cap \u2013 as a substitute in a 4-0 win against Holland \u2013 back in 2006. \u201cIt seems like yesterday,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to sink in that I\u2019ve got to 100.\u201d By way of accelerating the process Sampson and his backroom staff joined her team-mates in making a big fuss on Tuesday when she was presented with a specially made commemorative DVD. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to thank all the players and staff I\u2019ve worked with for,\u201d says Scott who, despite considerable promise, gave up athletics after realising she was more of \u201ca team person\u201d. Sketchy Chinese internet reception dashed her hopes of watching her favourite male side \u2013 Sunderland \u2013 beat Newcastle United in Sunday\u2019s derby but she was suitably delighted by the result. \u201cA massive win,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s always nice to be able to wind up Newcastle fans.\u201d It seems a long time since she traded jokes with colleagues of a black-and-white persuasion while working as a coach in Gateshead. Back then far too many hours were spent making the 350-mile, seven-hour round trip to Everton for evening training sessions, drinking countless cans of Red Bull while struggling to stay awake at the wheel. Happily the increasing professionalism of the Women\u2019s Super League has changed the game\u2019s landscape beyond recognition \u2013 not to mention improving England to the point where they are realistic contenders to win Euro 2017 in the Netherlands. \u201cMore players turning professional has transformed the standard, technically and physically,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd clubs like Manchester City [where the women\u2019s team share outstanding facilities and top coaches with their male equivalents] are raising the bar. We got a crowd of 3,200 for our final WSL game of the season. The quality\u2019s so much better now.

The announcement followed a four-day Communist party summit in Beijing where China\u2019s top leaders debated financial reforms and how to maintain growth at a time of heightened concerns about the economy. China will \u201cfully implement a policy of allowing each couple to have two children as an active response to an ageing population\u201d, the party said in a statement published by Xinhua, the official news agency. \u201cThe change of policy is intended to balance population development and address the challenge of an ageing population,\u201d Some celebrated the move as a positive step towards greater personal freedom in China. But human rights activists and critics said the loosening \u2013 which means the Communist party continues to control the size of Chinese families \u2013 did not go far enough. \u201cThe state has no business regulating how many children people have,\u201d said William Nee, a Hong Kong-based activist for Amnesty International.   Related: China may bring in 'two-child policy' to tackle demographic timebomb    \u201cIf China is serious about respecting human rights, the government should immediately end such invasive and punitive controls over people\u2019s decisions to plan families and have children.\u201d For months there has been speculation that Beijing was preparing to abandon the divisive family planning rule, which was introduced in 1980 because of fears of a population boom. Demographers in and outside China have long warned that its low fertility rate \u2013 which experts say lies somewhere between 1.2 and 1.5 children a woman \u2013 was driving the country towards a demographic crisis. Since 2013, there has been a gradual relaxation of China\u2019s family planning laws that already allowed minority ethnic families and rural couples whose firstborn was a girl to have more than one child. Thursday\u2019s announcement that all couples would be allowed two children caught many experts by surprise.  \u201cI\u2019m shaking to be honest,\u201d said Stuart Gietel-Basten, an University of Oxford demographer who has argued for the end of the one-child policy. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that you have been working on and saying for years and recommending they should do something and it finally happened. It\u2019s just a bit of a shock.\u201d   Related: China's one-child policy: the only child's view - in pictures    The Communist party credits the policy with preventing 400m births, thus contributing to China\u2019s dramatic economic takeoff since the 1980s. But the human toll has been immense, with forced sterilisations, infanticide and sex-selective abortions that have caused a dramatic gender imbalance that means millions of men will never find female partners. \u201cThe gender imbalance is going to be a very major problem,\u201d warned Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham. \u201cWe are talking about between 20 million and 30 million young men who are not going to be able to find a wife. That creates social problems and that creates a huge number of people who are frustrated.\u201d History showed that countries with a very large number of unmarried men of military age were more likely to pursue aggressive, militarist foreign policy initiatives, Tsang said. In one of the most shocking recent cases of human rights abuses related to the once-child policy, a woman who was seven months pregnant was abducted by family planning officials in Shaanxi province in 2012 and forced to have an abortion. Opponents say the policy has created a demographic \u201ctimebomb\u201d, with China\u2019s 1.3 billion-strong population ageing rapidly, and the country\u2019s labour pool shrinking. The UN estimates that by 2050 China will have about 440 millionpeople over 60. The working-age population \u2013 those between 15 and 59 \u2013 fell by 3.71 million last year, a trend that is expected to continue.    From a political, pragmatic perspective, loosening the policy is good for the party  Stuart Gietel-Basten, demographer     There were no immediate details on how or when China\u2019s new \u201ctwo-child policy\u201d would be implemented. But Gietel-Basten said the policy change was good news for both China\u2019s people and its leaders, who stood to gain from ending a highly unpopular rule. \u201cFrom a political, pragmatic perspective, loosening the policy is good for the party but also it is a good thing for individual couples who want to have that second child. It is a kind of win-win for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions of ordinary Chinese couples will be allowed to have a second child if they want to \u2013 this is clearly a very positive thing.\u201d Experts said the relaxation of family planning rules is unlikely to have a lasting demographic impact, particularly in urban areas where couples were now reluctant to have two children because of the high cost.  \u201cJust because the government says you can have another child, it doesn\u2019t mean the people will immediately follow,\u201d said Liang Zhongtang, a demographer at the Shanghai Academy of Social Science. Gietel-Basten said: \u201cIn the short term, probably there will be a little baby boom particularly in some of the poorer provinces where the rules have been very strict, like in Sichuan or in parts of the south. But in the long term I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make an enormous amount of difference.\u201d Dai Qing, a Chinese writer who has publicly called for all family planning rules to be scrapped, said the announcement was a positive step. \u201cIt shows that the authorities have understood the changes in the total population and the demographic structure and started to address them,\u201d she said. But Dai said questions remained, particularly about how Beijing would enforce its new two-child policy. \u201cEven if people are allowed to have two children, what if they want to have three children or more? What if unmarried women want to have their own children? At the end of the day, it\u2019s about women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedoms.\u201d    They should abolish the family planning system. Only that way can they straighten out their relationship with the people  Liang Zhongtang, demographer     Others expressed concern that the announcement of the new two-child policy, which referred to Chinese couples, suggested children born outside of wedlock would continue to be penalised by the government. Liang called on the Communist party to completely dismantle its unpopular and outdated family planning rules.  \u201cI think they should abolish the family planning [system] once for all and let people decide how many children they want to have. Only that way can they straighten out their relationship with the people.\u201d But Gietel-Basten said it would have been virtually unthinkable for Beijing to completely abandon its family planning rules. \u201cThat would in some ways imply that the policy was wrong \u2026 which of course would be a smack in the face of the last two generations of policymakers who stuck by it,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting rid of it completely probably wasn\u2019t an option in the short term. But in the long term it\u2019s certainly not inconceivable that they would move towards a pronatalist policy at some point, maybe over the next five or 10 years, and that they would develop policies similar to in Korea or in Taiwan, or in Hong Kong or in Singapore, where there would be incentives for couples with one child to have a second child. I certainly think that is the future direction it [policy] is likely to go in.\u201d   Related: China's one-child policy \u2013 timeline    As news that the notorious policy was coming to an end spread on Thursday, Chinese citizens celebrated on social media, while also lamenting how long change had taken to arrive.  Some government critics expressed their contempt for the policy by altering photographs of the red Communist party propaganda banners that adorn towns and villages across China urging residents to obey family planning rules.  \u201cWe reward families with two children and fine those with only one,\u201d read one spoof poster mocking Beijing\u2019s change of heart. \u201cThose who decide not to have children or who are infertile should be thrown in jail.\u201d  Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Reproductive rights", "Population", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-29T14:37:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/global-luxury-goods-market-exceeds-1tn-euro", "sentences": ["Related: Shanghai in slow lane as market crash accelerates slump in luxury car sales    The findings echo recent comments from British luxury fashion house Burberry, which has blamed a sharp sales slowdown on weaker demand among shoppers in China."], "title": "Global luxury goods market exceeds \u20ac1tn", "article": "Strong sales of luxury cars and fine art have helped push the global luxury goods market higher than \u20ac1tn (\u00a3700bn) for the first time, according to a new report, despite slowing demand for personal luxuries such as jewellery and handbags. The personal luxury market has been hit by weaker demand in China and Hong Kong, said the annual report from consultancy Bain &amp; Co. Chinese consumers account for 31% of global luxury sales, followed by US consumers at 24% and Europeans at 18%.  Chinese consumers are still spending, but they are now heading to Europe and Japan \u2013 attracted by the weak euro and yen \u2013 rather than their traditional shopping destinations of Hong Kong and Macau. About 80% of Chinese luxury goods shopping is done abroad.   Related: Shanghai in slow lane as market crash accelerates slump in luxury car sales    The findings echo recent comments from British luxury fashion house Burberry, which has blamed a sharp sales slowdown on weaker demand among shoppers in China. The fastest growth was for sales of luxury cars, up 8% year on year, and fine art, up 6% - with postwar and contemporary work particularly strong.  Growth in the personal luxury goods markets, which includes jewellery, watches and leather goods as well as fashion and perfumes, slowed to 1-2% from 3% in 2014. It is now worth \u20ac253bn. Back in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the market grew by 13%, 5% and 6% respectively. \u201cFor the last several years, we\u2019ve referenced \u2018luxury\u2019s new normal\u2019 with a deceleration of the personal luxury goods market. Now, we are starting to feel the impact of that slowdown,\u201d said Claudia D\u2019Arpizio, a Bain partner in Milan and lead author of the study. \u201cThe challenge for luxury brands in this environment is how to successfully navigate through hard-to-predict volatility.\u201d Another reason for the slowdown is the retreat of Russians, particularly from their shopping hotspots such as Dubai and Milan. They cut their tax-free spending in Europe by 37%. A year ago, they were the world\u2019s second biggest buyers of luxury goods behind the Chinese, but their purchasing power has halved with the rouble\u2019s devaluation. Asia registered its worst performance ever, due to the lacklustre trend of mainland China and a sharp drop in sales in Hong Kong and Macau. However, in Europe, Chinese tax-free purchases increased by 64% while Americans increased their spending in Europe by 67%. The \u201csuper dollar\u201d made the US too expensive for many global tourists. Nevertheless, the US remains the world\u2019s largest luxury market at \u20ac79bn; New York City alone outweighed all of Japan.   Related: Burberry sales hit by Chinese slowdown    Local buying by Europeans and Americans has fallen in the past five years. D\u2019Arpizio said many major brands had alienated local consumers by raising prices for certain items such as bestselling handbags.  The increases, which she estimated at 30-50% over the past three years for some items, were partly driven by the desire to bring prices into line with other regions such as Asia, where prices were higher due to tariffs and other factors.  D\u2019Arpizio said: \u201cI think some luxury brands focused on China too much and lost focus on the local European customer base and as a result, some of them feel betrayed by these brands. Those who could afford these goods in Europe started asking themselves: \u2018Why should I pay so much money for this product?\u2019\u201d  Local European and American consumers increasingly prefer to shop at discount outlets.

Wang said Beijing\u2019s decision to abandon a 35-year-old policy that had become a political liability showed \u201ccourage and wisdom\u201d. But he predicted it would do almost nothing to boost China\u2019s low fertility rate, which experts put at between 1.2 and 1.5 children per woman. Chinese couples no longer had small families because of draconian family planning rules but because of social and economic factors such as the cost of urban life and education and uncertainty in the job market, Wang said: \u201cThe low fertility rate is here to stay.\u201d   Related: End of China\u2019s one-child policy comes tragically late for many    Zhang Suli, 32, is a case in point. She gave birth to her first child \u2013 a baby boy nicknamed Xiaobiao \u2013 40 days ago at the Bogh. Under China\u2019s new regulations, Xiaobiao could legally have a brother or sister without his parents having to pay a hefty fine. But Zhang said she had no plans for a second child.            400m births prevented: what China\u2019s one-child policy did to its population     \u201cThere\u2019s too much pressure. Raising a kid in Beijing is too expensive,\u201d she explained as she waited with her mother in the maternity hospital\u2019s packed waiting room. Wang said many urban Chinese couples felt the same. \u201cIt is extraordinarily expensive [to raise a child in places such as Beijing or Shanghai]. The cost of housing is among the highest in the world, the commuting, the childcare facilities, all this combined [means] these cities are not conducive to high fertility,\u201d he said. Wang said rural families, who were fighting to improve the quality of their own lives, were also unlikely to want larger families. \u201cHaving children drags them down,\u201d he said. China\u2019s state-controlled media painted the Communist party\u2019s decision as a triumph for would-be parents.  \u201cWe knew that the one-child policy would be abandoned at some point, but we never thought it would come so soon,\u201d a newlywed named only as Ms Wang was quoted as saying by Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s come in time for us!\u201d Fancy Chen, a 35-year-old mother of two boys, aged one and four, also described the move as a victory, particularly for women of her generation who were running out of time to have a second child. Chen \u2013 whose sons are nicknamed \u201cBig Mao\u201d and \u201cMao Two\u201d - took advantage of a partial relaxation of family planning rules in 2013 that allowed parents who were both only children to have a second child. \u201cI think it is good news. More families can have a second baby. Two kids is very good in China,\u201d said Chen, who was born in 1980, the year the one-child policy was introduced, and therefore restricted to a life without siblings. As an only child, Chen said she knew only too well the pressures of having to care for her elderly parents alone. \u201cLast month my mum went to the hospital and my son got a fever. I didn\u2019t know whether to stay at the hospital or with him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough for me. So if we are able to have two kids we should, I think.\u201d     Fancy Chen had her second child following a 2013 policy change that allowed parents who were both only children to have two children. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    But a cartoon in Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post on Friday reflected the widespread reluctance to have more than one child. \u201cThey\u2019re dropping the one-child policy,\u201d a mother, holding a bawling child, tells her husband in the picture. \u201cI hope that\u2019s on a voluntary basis,\u201d he replies. Wang said it was possible that couples in medium and small-sized cities, where the cost of living was much lower, would take advantage of the two-child policy.  Li Ze said that while many did not have the means to raise a child in Beijing, in his hometown of Baoding, a mid-sized industrial city, things were more affordable. \u201cIt would probably cost about 500,000 yuan (\u00a351,500) there to raise a child until the age of 18,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Beijing it would be 800,000 or a million,\u201d his wife said. \u201cToo expensive.\u201d   Related: China's one-child policy \u2013 timeline    Stuart Gietel-Basten, an Oxford University demographer, predicted that within a decade Beijing might introduce \u201cpro-natalist\u201d policies as it sought to avert a demographic crisis by offering incentives for couples to have more children. But Wang said the Communist party was probably still grappling with how to deal with the millions of people who had suffered human rights abuses such as forced sterilisations or abortions because of the one-child policy. \u201cThese are the more urgent issues,\u201d he said. Baby-related stocks reportedly surged on Friday following the demise of the much-loathed policy. One report suggested the change could bring about six million new births each year, creating a market worth 353 billion yuan (\u00a336.4bn). But in the baby boutiques surrounding Beijing\u2019s largest maternity hospital, shop managers were cautious. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will make a huge difference,\u201d said Wang Haiyan, who sells clothing for expectant mothers. \u201cThese days people don\u2019t want to have two children,\u201d said the shopkeeper next door, who gave her name only as Ms Lu. \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.

It was as close as he ever came in F1 but was not the end of his story. Five years on he has another title in his sights and this time is determined to ensure he crosses the line as champion. In 2014 Webber left F1 and Red Bull to race an LMP1 prototype sports car for Porsche in the highly competitive FIA World Endurance Championship, of which the Le Mans 24 Hours is the centrepiece. The marque had last entered Le Mans in 1998, a race which they won but their return last year was not expected to become so successful, so quickly. The team took this year\u2019s 24 Hours and Webber, with his team-mates Timo Bernhard and Brendon Hartley, now leads the drivers\u2019 championship. A win here in Shanghai on Sunday and a DNF for their Audi rivals would be enough for the title, although with Audi\u2019s solid reliability it will likely go down to the final round in Bahrain.   Related: Mark Webber and Porsche on Shanghai pole in World Endurance Championship    Webber, ever the realist, is not counting his chickens nor does he downplay the fact the F1 title was the one that meant the most. But he is fully aware what an achievement it will be to finally become a world champion. \u201cIt\u2019s not a walk in the park,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s brutally rewarding and brutally tough to get the results and it will be awesome if we can do it. We\u2019ve won a lot of races and that\u2019s been really, really good.\u201d Indeed, his squad have three wins from the past three meetings in which, despite Porsche\u2019s pace advantage, the racing has been hard. It gets \u201cfruity at the front\u201d as Webber puts it, employing the type of engaging language that elevates his autobiography, Aussie Grit: My Formula One Journey, published earlier this year, beyond the average dry sports tome. It is a tone in the book complemented by an open, personal narrative, proving that, as always, he is unafraid to offer criticism and compliment. In Shanghai, preparing for the six-hour race, he is unstinting with both. While Lewis Hamilton enjoys a honeymoon period in Mexico after winning his third world championship and his detractors point to the advantage his Mercedes has over the rest of the field, Webber is unequivocal in his recognition of the British driver. \u201cIf you ask any of the other world champions around him, Sebastian [Vettel] or Fernando [Alonso], multiple world champions, do they hold him in high esteem \u2013 absolutely yes,\u201d he says. \u201cHe deserved the third world title. He\u2019s an exceptionally gifted driver, very strong in all conditions, that\u2019s why I love watching him drive. He would also be even more potent if the cars were quicker and stronger and more demanding to drive because he\u2019s that type of guy. I think he\u2019d even get more out if it.\u201d Of the sport Hamilton dominates, in which the current formula has been widely criticised, he is less sympathetic. \u201cIt\u2019s been a broken record for the last three years. Its nothing new, everyone\u2019s been talking about it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe drivers in there can\u2019t talk about what they want to change but make the cars faster and make them louder \u2013 back to when the grandstands were full. That\u2019s why it worked.\u201d     Mark Webber\u2019s Porsche during practice in Shanghai on Friday. Photograph: Marcio Machado/ZUMA Press/Corbis    Which is straightforward enough but he also brings a racer\u2019s perspective to F1\u2019s current travails. Long a critic of the Pirelli tyres that are designed to degrade, this initiative, meant to improve the show, has achieved the opposite he believes. \u201cWhen you give up that much mechanical grip the cars are punished aerodynamically,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t really follow each other as well and that\u2019s why it becomes a DRS race.\u201d Other drivers have expressed similar opinions but as ever Webber makes the point most pithily. \u201cDo you want to watch gimmicks, or do you want to watch guys pushing hard?\u201d He knows all about the latter, having struggled and fought against the odds to make it to F1 and then carve out a 12-year career in the sport, including nine wins with Red Bull. Senior team members of which do not come out well in his book but toward the team itself, currently struggling to find an engine supplier amid warnings from their owner, Dietrich Mateschitz, that he may pull out of F1, Webber harbours no grudges and is optimistic. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of good mates at Red Bull and I think they will continue,\u201d he says. \u201cBernie [Ecclestone] and Dietrich will sort something out, that\u2019s the level it will go to, above the shadow boxing and sort it out with the big guys.\u201d Mateschitz, he notes, is fiercely loyal to his staff, a quality that Webber clearly admires and doubtless brings to his relationship with Porsche, where the focus is on looking forward rather than back. Win or lose the championship he will race for the team next year but beyond that he insists he has yet to decide. It is a question he deflects with some trademark, dry Aussie wit. \u201cThe team need to like me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would help my employment situation if I managed to get a title ...\u201d Still smiling, still fighting, his journey beyond F1 continues and may yet see him become a world champion.", "tags": ["Mark Webber", "World Endurance Championship", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Formula One 2015", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-10-31T10:42:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/31/mark-webber-porsche-shanghai-pole-world-endurance-championship", "sentences": ["Certainly Mark Webber and Brendon Hartley represented the most harmonious meeting of Australia and New Zealand respectively that will take place on Saturday, when the pair claimed pole for the FIA World Endurance Championship\u2019s penultimate round in Shanghai.", "2014\u2019s fastest lap in Shanghai set by Jani in a Porsche was almost five seconds slower than Hartley and Webber."], "title": "Mark Webber and Porsche on Shanghai pole in World Endurance Championship", "article": "Could it be the calm before the storm?

For the moment then, it was smiles all round, before the serious business of winning the six hours on Sunday in their bid to become world champions begins, prefaced by, of course, the small matter of a game of rugby to enjoy. Certainly thus far, the prospect of their countrymen going head to head at Twickenham does not seem to have distracted them. The Porsche duo (alongside their fellow team-mate Timo Bernhard) now have four poles this season and, with the extra point for qualifying on the front of the grid, have done exactly what was needed to enhance their title hopes. It was, noted Webber: \u201cDefinitely the only time we will help each other today. Tonight is war and I hope the Aussies can do the business against the All Blacks.\u201d Of the actual qualifying run, he said: \u201cEveryone has done a great job. Brendon laid down a great time and made it easy for me to follow that.\u201d   Related: Mark Webber\u2019s journey beyond F1 takes him to brink of first world title    Hartley also said the real business was the full six hours on Sunday. \u201cThe car was great to drive and it\u2019s one point extra today which is fantastic but we have a big day tomorrow,\u201d he said. The No17 squad now lead their championship rivals the No7 Audi team of Marcel F\u00e4ssler, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer by two points, having overtaken them in the standings with three wins from the past three meetings at the N\u00fcrburgring, Circuit of the Americas and Fuji. With only one race remaining after this round in China, a win here and a DNF for the Audi squad would secure the title for the Porsche crew. Although in all likelihood they will have to wait until Bahrain to clinch it, since Audi, bulletproof on reliability, have not suffered a mechanical failure that ended a race for two years. Hartley and Webber put in almost identical and imperious laps to secure pole. The New Zealander opened with a time of 1min 42.621sec, matched by Webber only two-tenths back with 1.42.818. Their average that decides the top slot was seven-tenths clear of the sister Porsche of Neel Jani, Romain Dumas and Marc Lieb, and almost two seconds quicker than the No7 Audi, which qualified in fourth. It is a pace advantage that Porsche have enjoyed this season since winning the Le Mans 24 Hours in June but also reflects how far and how fast the series and its hybrid technology is advancing. The times this year, while consuming less fuel than last year, are down across the board. 2014\u2019s fastest lap in Shanghai set by Jani in a Porsche was almost five seconds slower than Hartley and Webber. Hartley\u2019s time, a lap record for prototypes, was only four-tenths slower than the fastest lap Lewis Hamilton set here earlier this year on his way to winning the Chinese Grand Prix. They will be looking only to replicate the pace in the race, although with high rear-tyre degradation expected, managing the rubber will be crucial. Essentially, however, they have the raw speed that Audi cannot match and have the advantage of the sister car alongside them on the grid, something Porsche, who are 54 points clear in the manufacturers\u2019 championship and could wrap up that title on Sunday, will be looking to maximise. Should they do so it will be their first constructors\u2019 title since 1986, when Britain\u2019s Derek Bell won the championship, and their 13th in total.

He, in turn, rubbed my shoulders, amid the organisers\u2019s cries to \u201cgive it a good pounding!\u201d. He and I had been put in a group, made to chant \u201clove slogans\u201d and introduce ourselves in quick succession to a circle of people in avid search of marriage partners. Everything was deathly serious, and about as romantic as someone expectorating. It was a singles mixer organised by Jiayuan, one of China\u2019s biggest matchmaking agencies, where I went to research modern dating habits. The Nasdaq-listed Jiayuan, unabashedly using the stock ticker symbol DATE, held enormously popular events, some attracting tens of thousands of participants. My dating foray was part of a larger exploration into the effects of China\u2019s one-child policy, the name commonly applied to the set of curbs put in place 35 years ago to slow its population growth. Though known as \u201cone-child\u201d, the policy was riddled with exceptions that allowed some to have more than one child, depending on your profession, where you lived and how much you were willing to pay in penalties, a system that was enormously confusing even for people within China, let alone outside. Last week, Beijing announced a loosening of these regulations, allowing couples nationwide to have two children. But the move, done to mitigate a looming demographic crisis, will do little to avert the damaging consequences that affect the daily lives of ordinary Chinese citizens. We are used to thinking of the one-child policy in extremes. Forced abortions. Sterilisations. Infanticide. In truth, it had a stronger and more insidious impact, shaping how one-sixth of the world live, love and die. People in China debating questions such as who to marry, what jobs to choose, how to buy a place to live or how to have a comfortable old age have had the answers to these questions shaped by the policy. A huge gender imbalance and the creation of a generation of only children \u2013 the \u201cLittle Emperors\u201d \u2013 have vastly increased marriage anxieties. Parents with only children are hugely invested in their offspring\u2019s life choices, especially whom they marry. And since the policy, coupled with an age-old preference for sons, has created a Canadian-sized population of surplus men \u2013 some 30 million \u2013 there are fewer brides to go around, intensifying the marriage squeeze. More than ever since the 1949 founding of the People\u2019s Republic, marriage has become a matter of money, valuation and investment. The bachelor surplus has buoyed the country\u2019s real estate market, as families with sons snap up apartments to make their offspring more desirable on the marriage market. Some economists estimate that this sex-ratio imbalance accounted for a 30-48% increase in housing prices in China between 2003 and 2009. The phenomenon has popularised the Chinese saying, \u201cbuilding a nest to catch a phoenix\u201d, and the ones best feathering their nests are estate agents. China\u2019s soaring property prices have created a colony of mortgage slaves \u2013 fangnu \u2013 hapless people on the hook for astronomical sums similar to America\u2019s sub-prime lending victims. Rural practices have changed too. In 2009, I visited a central China bachelor village \u2013 a hamlet with no marriageable women. The female shortage had caused a huge rise in caili, the bride price typically offered from the groom to the woman\u2019s family. During the Mao era of the 1970s, bride prices were typically modest \u2013 a set of clothes or perhaps a bicycle. But starting from about 2001, the shortage of brides caused caili to rise sharply, to as much as a decade\u2019s worth of farm income. This resulted in scams and the village I visited had just experienced a rash of runaway brides, a group of con-artists who ruthlessly met, married and made away with their bride prices, leaving the men broke, lonely and humiliated. One parent of a jilted bridegroom told me: \u201cI wish I had daughters.\u201d Four years later, the shortage of women meant caili exchanges \u2013 once a quaint countryside custom \u2013 had spread to the major cities. The same year, real estate company Vanke published a map of caili rates across China. Shanghai was priciest, with brides going for $16,500 \u2013 about four times the average Chinese worker\u2019s annual salary. With marriage anxiety at an all-time high, companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Baidu, China\u2019s online search and dotcom juggernaut have begun offering singles clubs as a recruiting tool. These danshen julebu not only attract workers, but reassure their parents, especially those whose only child is working far away from home. Baidu even sends an annual newsletter of its club activities to employees\u2019 families. The one-child policy has even affected hiring decisions: some companies explicitly advertise a preference for applicants with siblings, saying Little Emperors have been raised with such high expectations that they make poor employees. China Railway Construction Group, the country\u2019s second largest state-owned construction enterprise, once put out a want ad stating: \u201cNon-only children college grads from rural areas have priority\u201d. A human resources manager quoted in a local paper said: \u201cWe don\u2019t hire two kinds of persons \u2013 the wealthy ones and single children.\u201d When China launched the one-child policy in 1980, one of the big questions was: will a generation of Little Emperors be a nation of over-indulged, spoilt children? Multiple studies have been inconclusive, but a 2012 study by Australian economists did find marked differences in the Little Emperor cohort. They were more risk-averse, less trusting and more pessimistic during a series of behavioural tests. The idea that the Little Emperor generation is more pessimistic is perhaps least surprising to the generation themselves, many of whom label themselves as losers, a \u201csandwich generation\u201d. The term kubi has become internet slang as self-mockery, used to describe a feeling of bitterness and severe pressure.    This transition took almost half a century in the west and, as a result, those countries have had more time to adapt    Part of the kubi attitude is due to feeling the burden of heavy expectations. A decade ago, academic Mei Zhong analysed a series of letters from only children that had been published in a book called The Only-Children Declaration. Zhong broke them into categories that revealed these children were pressured by excessive parental love and loneliness. They struggled with the burden of fulfilling their parents\u2019 expectations \u2013 especially since many of these parents suffered under the Cultural Revolution. Those heavy expectations on this first generation of Little Emperors will intensify as their parents age. By the mid-2020s, China will be adding 10 million more elderly to its population each year but losing 7 million working adults. The shrinking workforce will have to shoulder the burden of ageing parents, grandparents and all the financial and emotional baggage that come with this \u2013 dementia, cancer, brittle bones, broken hips \u2013 all on China\u2019s inadequate social safety net. This transition towards more older people and fewer young workers is happening in almost every modern society. Every major industrialised nation now lives longer and has fewer children. This transition took almost half a century in the west and, as a result, those countries have had more time to adapt. In China, due to the artificial weight of the one-child policy, the transition will happen in just one generation and the nation is woefully unprepared. Of all the negative repercussions of the policy, the ageing factor is the most painful, because it is definitely happening. We don\u2019t know if China\u2019s gender imbalance could lead to a more warlike nation. We can\u2019t be sure if China\u2019s cohort of Little Emperors could make for a nation of pessimistic, solipsistic low-risk takers. While we can be fairly certain the one-child policy will be a drag on China\u2019s economic growth \u2013 even with this latest shift to the two-child policy \u2013 we don\u2019t know how much. We do know, however, that short of some cataclysmic plague or war, China\u2019s vast cohort of workers will grow older: by 2050, one in every fourth person in China will be a retiree. And who will minister to this country of the old? Little Emperors, turned Slaves. No wonder they feel kubi. Jenova Chen, a highly successful gamer named as one of the world\u2019s top young innovators by MIT Technology Review, told me he\u2019ll probably have only one child. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I dare to have more than one child. I feel I can barely take care of my parents,\u201d he said. Last week\u2019s latest move to a two-child policy is an attempt to ward off these issues and may be a prelude to the lifting of all birth restrictions. But this is unlikely to spark the baby boom Beijing hopes for. Even though polls show many couples could have two children, many say in practice it\u2019s unaffordable and too stressful to have more than one. In that sense, ironically, the one-child policy should be judged a huge success, for it has thoroughly changed the mindset of people in China.

With their third one-two of the season and the race won by the drivers\u2019 championship leaders of the No17 car, Mark Webber, Brendon Hartley and Timo Bernhard, the marque also secured the manufacturers\u2019 title with one race to go.   Related: Mark Webber\u2019s journey beyond F1 takes him to brink of first world title    A jubilant team celebrated with abandon after the race, and well they might. In racing terms this is a remarkable achievement. The old rule of thumb used to be that for a new entrant to win the Le Mans 24 Hours, it takes at least three years. Porsche only returned to the top level of prototype sports car racing in 2014, yet earlier this year they not only won Le Mans but have now claimed the overall title as well. It is their 13th constructors\u2019 championship in endurance racing and their first since Derek Bell took the title in 1986. All in only their second season and against formidable competition in the form of Audi who have utterly dominated the sport for over a decade. \u201cWhat this team have done in this short period of time is just incredible,\u201d said Webber. \u201cTo come at this level and have the results they have this year \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to produce these type of cars and this type of performance week in week out, it\u2019s an incredible performance.\u201d That they achieved it this year is to a great extent down to the No17 car\u2019s crew. Taking the flag here in Shanghai was their fourth successive victory and has put them within touching distance of the drivers\u2019 title as well. The world championship that eluded Webber in Formula One is now within his grasp. They lead their Audi rivals, the No7 squad of Marcel F\u00e4ssler, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer by 12 points, with the final race in Bahrain to come. Regardless of where the Audi finishes, they can clinch the win with a third place-or-better finish and if they score the extra point for claiming pole, fourth will be enough. A murky, rainy morning had seen the six hours begin behind the safety car but racing proper was under way by lap three. The wet negates Porsche\u2019s pace advantage but early in the race the No17 still seemed to have the measure of the Audis. However as the rain became heavier, and at times the track resembled a skid pan so many cars were taking excursions off the island, the playing field was further levelled and the leaders began scrapping. Tr\u00e9luyer and Bernhard were all over one another and by lap 59 when the former took the lead, the front four had only four seconds between them.   Related: F1: Mexico Grand Prix \u2013 live!    It was thrilling stuff and had the rain continued Audi might have had a chance to upset Porsche\u2019s plans but as it eased off just after the halfway point, the title winners took advantage. Able to double stint their wet tyres, the No17 and its sister car, the No18 of Neel Jani, Romain Dumas and Marc Lieb, regained the front two spots. When Webber took to the track for the final stint and began banging in fastest laps on the slick inters the No7 Audi was valiantly fighting but realistically only for second place. On a drying track it was the best they could hope for to keep their championship hopes alive but both the Porsche 919 Hybrids, the class of the field this season, were proving hard to contain. They run longer on fuel, work their tyres better and are out and out quicker in raw pace. All amply demonstrated not only by the winners but by the No18 car. It had dropped to the back of the field on the first racing lap after Lieb was clipped by Lotterer, fought back to the front once, then in the fifth hour dropped second place to F\u00e4ssler after Dumas spun at turn two. Soon after which the Audis where the first to take slicks and were immediately five seconds a lap quicker. But Porsche reacted quickly, switched to new rubber and with the No18 able to run a long last stint and take a splash and dash with 15 minutes to go, were, despite all their travails, still able to claim second place. The final factor in Porsche\u2019s dominance has, of course, been reliability, which the 919 now has in spades. The team have had only one DNF this season, the No17 at Silverstone and only one mechanical problem that compromised the No18 at COTA, although it finished the race. Should they maintain the record in Bahrain and stay out of trouble the drivers\u2019 championship is theirs for the taking. Certainly at that race there will be no rain to trouble their parade.", "tags": ["World Endurance Championship", "Mark Webber", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-11-01T19:59:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/china-big-jet-club-homegrown-passenger-plane", "sentences": ["China\u2019s attempt to propel itself into the top flight of the global aviation industry has taken another step forwards as the country\u2019s first big homegrown passenger jet rolled off the assembly line in Shanghai.", "C919, China&#39;s first homemade large passenger aircraft\u00a0rolls off the assembly line\u00a0in Shanghai pic.twitter.com/Bd0ezmPnxi&mdash; China Xinhua News (@XHNews) November 2, 2015    The Communist party\u2019s official mouthpiece newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, declared the accomplishment \u201can historic breakthrough\u201d."], "title": "China arrives in 'big jet club' with homegrown passenger plane", "article": "China\u2019s attempt to propel itself into the top flight of the global aviation industry has taken another step forwards as the country\u2019s first big homegrown passenger jet rolled off the assembly line in Shanghai. About 4,000 people, including senior Communist party leaders, engineers and journalists, gathered at a hangar near the city\u2019s Pudong international airport for the unveiling of the 158-seat C919.

The development of China\u2019s first large passenger jet has huge symbolic value for the Communist party as President Xi Jinping pursues what he calls the \u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d. \u201cA great nation must have its own large commercial aircraft,\u201d Li Jiaxiang, the head of China\u2019s civil aviation authority, told those invited to the plane\u2019s unveiling ceremony, according to Bloomberg. \u201cThe air transportation industry of China cannot completely rely on imports,\u201d he said. But hard-nosed commercial interests also lie behind China\u2019s bid to launch its first narrow-body jet. China\u2019s aviation industry has experienced turbo-charged growth, with the number of airports expected to rocket from about 200 to 240 in the next five years. Boeing predicts that by 2034 Chinese airlines will need to buy 4,630 new single-aisle planes worth $490bn (\u00a3318bn) and 1,500 new wide-body airplanes worth $450bn. However, most of the planes criss-crossing China\u2019s increasingly congested skies were made in the US, Europe or Brazil, where Embraer, the world\u2019s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, is based. China hopes to change that by developing its own range of passenger jets and turning the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) \u2013 the manufacturer behind the C919 \u2013 into a force as powerful and lucrative as Boeing, the largest US exporter. That dream remains some way off. Work on the C919 began in 2008 but its first test flight, originally scheduled for last year, would not now take place until 2016, Comac\u2019s chief executive was quoted as saying by Xinhua. Those tests would last three years before the plane could be put into commercial use, the People\u2019s Daily said. While the \u201cC\u201d in C919 stands for China, many of the plane\u2019s systems have been provided by foreign companies, including Honeywell and Rockwell Collins. Initially the plane, which has a range of between 2,530 miles (4,075km) and 3,450 miles, will be propelled by \u201cLeap\u201d engines produced by a partnership between France\u2019s Safran and the US firm GE. \u201cTo catch up with Boeing and Airbus is the ideal scenario, but it will take time,\u201d said Zhang Shuguang, a civil aviation expert from Beijing\u2019s Beihang University, who nevertheless described Monday\u2019s \u201crollout\u201d as a very meaningful moment for China.  \u201cDesigning large aircraft is a huge project,\u201d Zhang added. \u201cWe need to be patient and have confidence. We also need to show perseverance. Progress will not come easily.\u201d Comac said it had already received 517 orders for the C919, the majority from Chinese firms including Air China and Hainan Airlines, which last month announced Manchester\u2019s first ever direct flight to mainland China during Xi\u2019s state visit to Britain.

I should win a major next year.\u201d The timeframe in question spans two contrasting but surely pivotal years in the development of one of golf\u2019s most appealing stars. Last year, Fowler produced a stunning but frustrating run of top-five finishes in each of the four majors. In the US Open and the Open he finished second. As 2015 draws to a close, the Californian can reflect on worse major form but breakthrough successes: at the Players Championship, Deutsche Bank Championship and Scottish Open. \u201cI think in 2014 I probably overall played a little better and had more consistency,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cThis year I was just able to put myself in contention more often; I may not have been playing as well but when I got in those situations I wasn\u2019t scared of it, I felt really confident. I was out there to get the job done.\u201d So which was the more memorable? \u201cThis one, when I won,\u201d Fowler admits. \u201cLast year definitely set me up, it made me feel comfortable in those situations but actually getting the job done and winning tournaments in the heat of battle was very satisfying. \u201cI feel like getting to major winning is definitely a process. Some guys win them earlier than others. Some guys not so much get lucky but just happen to be in the right place at the right time and get one early in their career. Then you have Jordan Spieth, who is going to win multiple majors. I feel like after the last two years, I am in a great position to start winning majors. I just have to get that first one.\u201d   Related: Rickie Fowler relishes rivalry of a lifetime with Rory McIlroy    That won\u2019t, however, be the consequence of golfing obsession. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, you get people that hate on you saying \u2018you should be playing golf and practising every day\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not what makes you better. Being rounded and having a bit of normality in your life is important.\u201d We meet in a Shanghai hotel where he is preparing for this week\u2019s WGC-HSBC Champions tournament. Fowler laughs off the notion he has had a long day, fulfilling sponsor commitments overseas. He gets it. \u201cIf you want to be one of the best players in the world or become that, there comes a spotlight and responsibility.\u201d As we begin to talk, a sense of normality recedes; the Hollywood super-agent Ari Emanuel approaches Fowler, hugs him and recounts their meeting last summer. Fowler not only has talent, he has status that belies humble beginnings in Murrieta, south of Los Angeles. Fowler\u2019s father, Rod, provided sand and gravel to a golf range in exchange for Rickie being given balls to hit. Fowler wasn\u2019t afforded the privilege of club membership in his youth. Now golf is in the midst of an evolving global narrative with Fowler among those in the vanguard. Tim Finchem, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, revealed this week in Shanghai that television ratings for his organisation improved 20% last season. Finchem credits that boost to the engagement Fowler, Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day provide as the golfing icons of this generation. This group combine talent with excitement, none more so than Fowler. It no longer needs whispering that Tiger Woods has been usurped, albeit by a gang rather than an individual. We live in an age of comparison, as Fowler well knows. At 26, he is the odd one out among the four faces of this era having not yet added major glory to his list of achievements. \u201cTiger actually screwed up a lot of those comparisons for us because he came out and did stuff that doesn\u2019t happen, other than how much Arnie and Jack won,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cFor Tiger to have over 30% as a winning percentage for a spell; to have anywhere from five to 10 would be impressive. It was unthinkable, really, and it made comparisons tough. \u201cRight now we have a lot of good young players and I want to be compared to those guys. I need to win more and get majors on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to be on that same category. I am probably just outside looking in right now. \u201cIt is a long career, or that\u2019s what you would hope for. I hope to be playing against Rory, Jordan, Jason, Bubba [Watson] for another 20 years. At least 10-15 of those are going to be through the best part of our playing careers. It is going to go by quickly but that is still a lot of golf to be played so I am definitely not pushing or feeling like I am behind.\u201d McIlroy, Spieth and Watson will join Fowler in the field for the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament, which begins on Thursday. On Tuesday, the tournament sponsor announced a lucrative five-year extension to its commitment to the sport. In east Asia, interest naturally surrounds whether or not promoting the game in the area will soon translate to high-profile success; Guan Tianlang, who played in the Masters at 14, has been followed by the most recent winner of the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship, Jin Cheng. At 17, he will head for Augusta in April. Fowler has a vested interest. His great-grandparents emigrated from Japan to the United States in the 1920s \u2013 his middle name is Yakuta, after the grandfather who introduced him to golf \u2013 and he believes the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 could see an Asian man win a medal at golf. Just a fortnight ago, Fowler spent time in the Japanese capital. \u201cI love it there, the culture, the food; it feels natural to me,\u201d he explains. The beaming smile is back. The next Olympics also plays on Fowler\u2019s mind. Given the depth of American talent, and the fact only four players from the world\u2019s top 15 can qualify, he will inevitably be involved in a battle to reach Rio next summer. It is a challenge, typically, Fowler relishes. \u201cIt has been a thought ever since it was announced that we would be a part of 2016,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like if I do well in the majors and take care of playing well, that is going to be a bonus on the year. If I play well, I will hold my world ranking \u2013 if not better it \u2013 and be a part of that team. Right now, you would have to be ranked fifth or sixth in the world to be part of that US team so it will be tough but as I said, if I continue to play well and focus on what I have been doing, that will come. \u201cI always dreamed of being in an Olympic opening ceremony and walking out for my country but that was never a reality because golf wasn\u2019t part of it. I always watched it without being part of it as a possibility. I would watch summer and winter Olympics every time they were on. So that would be the thing I would look forward to most, that walk in the opening and closing ceremonies.\u201d When 2016 dawns, Fowler aims to let the recent past positively shape his future.", "tags": ["Rickie Fowler", "Golf", "European Tour", "PGA Tour", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-11-03T15:01:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/03/paris-to-stop-traffic-when-air-pollution-spikes", "sentences": ["Earlier this year, Paris was briefly more polluted than Shanghai \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities \u2013 when a cloud of noxious smog enveloped many of the capital\u2019s icons including the Eiffel tower."], "title": "Paris to stop traffic when air pollution spikes", "article": "The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has won a long-running battle with the French government to introduce emergency traffic bans in the city when air pollution spikes. The move to speed up the introduction of alternate driving days for cars with odd and even number registration plates was announced after pollution spiked in the French capital on Monday, just weeks before the city is due to host a crucial UN climate change summit. The ecology minister, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, had previously said the measure should only be applied after three consecutive days of low air quality. Parisians have criticised the government on social media for a perceived failure to act over predictions of dangerous levels of pollution from diesel fumes. But on Monday evening, Royal broke her silence to announce that the alternate vehicle ban would come into immediate effect \u201cwhen the region and the city authorities demand it\u201d. The issue has been the subject of a long-running dispute between the two leading Socialists; Hidalgo approves of the bans but Royal has, until now, insisted they are not the answer to the frequently toxic air quality that transforms the City of Light into the capital of gloom. Royal told Europe 1 radio that she had decided to put her trust in (local) elected officials, who she said were in \u201ccloser contact with those living in the city\u201d. In the event, Airparif, an independent group that monitors the city\u2019s air quality, said Monday\u2019s pollution was less serious than expected because of higher winds than forecast. However, the police authorities reduced speed limits on the motorways and major roads around the capital. Earlier this year, Paris was briefly more polluted than Shanghai \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities \u2013 when a cloud of noxious smog enveloped many of the capital\u2019s icons including the Eiffel tower. On Sunday, with weather and pollution experts warning that air quality was set to be poor once again, Hidalgo and the Socialist president of the region, Jean-Paul Huchon, insisted the \u201calternate traffic\u201d rule should be enforced immediately the following day. Hidalgo, who has made combating pollution a pillar of her mayoral programme, intends to ban vehicles from the main highway along the right bank of the river Seine from next year, to the fury of motoring organisations. She is also planning more \u201ccar-free\u201d days across the city after declaring the first such event at the end of September a success. In the last year, the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the riverside near Place de la Concorde has regularly topped 100\u00b5g/m3 with an average of 66\u00b5g/m3 over the year \u2013 well above the EU limit of 40\u00b5g/m3. France has flouted European Union air quality targets since 2005, while Airparif reported that pollution levels were up to double those allowed by regulations. Five pollutants pose a problem in the capital: benzene, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and the fine lead particles PM10 and PM2.5.

The atmosphere in the apartment is sullen and empty; there is a sense of time draining away. \u201cAll you have is time,\u201d she told an interviewer. \u201cIn my films you are aware of every second passing by. Through your body. You are facing yourself.\u201d Watching is painful. I begin to imagine I am standing in the shadows in her apartment with her, witnessing her solitude like a ghost. Excerpts from the larger image \u2013 vignettes containing her silhouette, the daylight blaring at the window, the people in the park, the trees \u2013 climb the dark walls of the installation. Everything is reduced to a drained and stark shadow play. Maniac Summer (2009), and its 2013 companion piece Maniac Shadows (2013), were both made during periods when Akerman was suffering episodes of bipolar disorder, hence the maniac of their titles. These are mysterious works. In Maniac Shadows we see her sorting discarded packaging in a corridor; scenes of Obama\u2019s election party played out on TV, footage of Akerman on a beach, her shadow falling across the water, another, taller shadow of a woman beside her, glimpses of kitchens, bathrooms, the artist\u2019s mother.  Past and present, places and people come and go. Unattended cameras count seconds and minutes and hours as they watch traffic on the street. The camera watches kids on the New York sidewalk, chance encounters, a street party. Other people\u2019s lives, with all their vivid randomness, appear and disappear.      No Home Movie, 2015, by Chantal Akerman    As soon as you grasp something it slips away. In a second chamber we watch footage of Akerman doing a public reading of a long text about her mother, recorded at the Kitchen in New York. I had to get down on my knees to listen to her halting voice coming through a speaker on the floor. Her mother, too, spent a lot of time alone in an apartment, recovering from an operation, beset by loneliness and the memories of being a survivor of Auschwitz, which she never discussed. Akerman only began to make what we might call installation works in the mid-1990s, after an invitation by curator Kathy Halbreich at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. The result of her first foray into gallery installation was L\u2019Est: au bord de la fiction, reworking footage from her 1993 film From the East, shot in several eastern bloc countries just after the collapse of communism. In the gallery version we see interminable queues in the snow, the faces of passers-by, a cellist accepting a bouquet to thunderous applause at the end of a concert, a woman in a cramped kitchen preparing food. Scenes of domestic and public life pass by. If there is a story, it is made by our movement from screen to screen and scene to scene, plotting a narrative for ourselves, captivated by small human gestures, anonymous faces that linger for a moment then are replaced by others. Who are these presences in their winter coats \u2013 and what are their lives now, in the east after communism?  The last monitor, alone in a further room, shows TV static and dim footage of a highway at night, retreating through a car\u2019s rear window. The artist speaks, inveighing against images and reciting the Jewish interdiction on graven images. Now images are everywhere, selling us everything from movies to ideologies.      Blade Runner meets JMW Turner ... Nightfall in Shanghai, 2007-09    This is the subject of her single-screen Nightfall in Shanghai, 2007. Bright lights and electronic adverts are reflected with a lurid shimmer on grey water under a polluted sky. A boat crosses the water. Instead of a sail, it too has a big screen planted on its deck. Night falls and animated adverts hang in the air. LED fireworks explode up the side of a skyscraper. The view is like Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner redone by JMW Turner, except for the fact that this is real.  There is no sign of human presence in Akerman\u2019s final gallery work, first shown at the current Venice Biennale. It occupies a big black box. The sound thunders out. You can hear it everywhere. Multiple suspended screens step back into the darkness; on each one a different desert rushes past, seen from a moving vehicle. Horizons rush across the screens, grey deserts sweep away and nearer bluffs of red rock and crumbling stone walls rush from left to right, sometimes faster, sometimes slowing to a halt. Visually relentless, Akerman\u2019s Now is also a furious aural cacophony, filled with the sound of skylarks, gunfire, ululations, calls and cries, the whinny of frightened horses, the sound of helicopter blades, thuds, engine noise and armoury. We hear all this but the deserts are empty. They could be anywhere: the Negev, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, places between places, regions whose names we hear constantly on news reports, places with no names at all. Everything rushes, slows and rushes again.      Chantal Akerman\u2019s final work, Now, shows empty desert scenes with the noise of unseen conflicts.    For now, Akerman\u2019s suicide changes how I look at her art. The fact is as grim as the concrete that frames the 16mm black-and-white projection of the young woman\u2019s body back at the entrance. Akerman\u2019s work is full of life, in all its extraordinary ordinariness, its sorrows and complications, its lengthening hours, its difficulties and terrors. Akerman said she felt that the kind of films that sweep you up and make you forget yourself were robbing you of your time and of life itself. She wants you to feel every passing second. Watch or don\u2019t watch, stay or leave. She makes me feel the world pulse through me, with all its urgency and all its stalled moments.

There, he is depicted alongside Rory McIlroy as player turned superhero. Spieth has become accustomed to billboard prominence. The 22-year-old used what he deems a \u201cspectacular\u201d 2015 to steal McIlroy\u2019s crown. Yet, a year ago he landed in China with only a single professional victory to his name and seeking to somehow pursue McIlroy, who had detached himself from the pack as the finest player in the world. The intervening months represent a fairytale. Spieth has won eight times worldwide, claimed two majors, lifted the FedEx Cup and collected five awards for individual excellence in one season. McIlroy, in part because of injury, is now the chaser, not only of Spieth but, in a rankings context, Jason Day.   Related: Tiger Woods\u2019 former caddie a \u2018slave\u2019? Steve Williams was the clear beneficiary of the duo | Ewan Murray    Unsurprisingly, Spieth is not of a mind to tread water. \u201cThere are definitely ways I can fine-tune and get better,\u201d he insisted on the eve of the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament. \u201cThat is what we try to do every year. That is what we have been able to do each year. \u201cI can get longer. That is something that I can do in the off season with a combination of swing and what I do in the gym. I have a long break in December and that is what I consider as my time to really make some changes.\u201d Spieth rebuffs any notion of mending something that is far from broken. \u201cYou just try to get very specific with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more specific you get with it, you find out there are certainly ways you can improve in every single category. \u201cI can focus a bit more on certain shots. I have already looked at some of the stats from the past year. For example, from 125 to 150 yards out I wasn\u2019t as consistent as where I was inside and outside of that distance, compared to everyone else on Tour, for strokes gained. So there are certain categories that I can improve on and maybe spend a little extra time.\u201d The American\u2019s unassuming nature gives the impression he could be uncomfortable with his new status. Maturity is the key to his handling of it. \u201cThis is a dream come true for me, it really is,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have juniors in China walking with our group for a pro-am, in the pouring rain, it is just something I probably didn\u2019t see even in my wildest dreams. \u201cBut with that also comes responsibility. When you are known and your face is part of the sport, as this year has now made it for myself as well as a few others, there is a responsibility to carry that torch on and off the course. \u201cWe just have to continue to have years like this one and keep it that way. If you don\u2019t play well, you are not going to see yourself in the airport in Shanghai. That\u2019s just not the way it works. It is cool, I have certainly embraced it all but I do completely understand it comes with a responsibility.\u201d Spieth has learned the value of time away from golf, an inevitable consequence of increased scrutiny. \u201cJust being able to settle down, what kind of impact that has, is significant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis past year, I did a better job of conserving energy. Even though I played a lot, I took some more time off and limited my practice at the end of three- or four-week stretches. In 2014, I didn\u2019t rest much. I probably hit too many balls, too many putts late into that season. By the time the FedEx play-offs came I didn\u2019t have enough gas.\u201d One thing has never changed; the unwilligness to show off trophies. \u201cThe US Open trophy and Green Jacket are just sitting in different places in my bedroom,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cIt is just that I feel uncomfortable if that stuff is all out in the open. I don\u2019t know why, I just do. I have always been that way. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I am searching to go back to normality by any means, I feel like it\u2019s maybe just how I am. When you achieve those goals and have those trophies in your possession, that\u2019s what is important to me. Not showing to other people; they already know that I won. \u201cWhat good does it do to have my friends over and just flaunt it in their face? I just keep things in my room and go for the next one.\u201d The reference point of this week in 2014 makes Spieth smile. \u201cIf I can sit here next time in the same position as what happened in the last 365 days, I will certainly be pleased. I don\u2019t remember there being anything specific here that sparked it. It was another solid week but not anything spectacular.\u201d Ah, that \u201cs\u201d word again. It is testimony to his astonishing progress that anything less from this brilliant young Texan raises eyebrows.

It without question boosts a wider narrative. McIlroy is the clear favourite to claim the European Tour\u2019s Race to Dubai order of merit title this month. In Willett, though, McIlroy may yet have a live challenger; around \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3282,000) separated the pair heading into this week\u2019s WGC-HSBC Champions in China.   Related: Tiger Woods\u2019 former caddie a \u2018slave\u2019? Steve Williams was the clear beneficiary of the duo | Ewan Murray    Willett\u2019s opening 65 at the Sheshan International Golf Club was merely the continuation of form which will almost certainly earn him a Ryder Cup berth next September. The more immediate question is whether or not the Yorkshireman can pose a live threat to McIlroy\u2019s status between now and the conclusion of the DP World Tour Championship on 22 November. Willett\u2019s consistency alone is worthy of the respect afforded to him by McIlroy. \u201cI haven\u2019t dropped out of the top two in the order of merit all year,\u201d Willett said. \u201cSo it has been a good one. I suppose when you win the Nedbank Challenge, you have a pretty good leapfrog on everyone else at the beginning of the season and it has been nice to be up there. \u201cRory overtook me somewhere in the middle and it\u2019s been a case of trying to claw it back every since. We have two-and-a-half weeks to try and claw a little more. \u201cIf you are within touching distance going to Dubai, it could be pretty interesting there. If you can do it, great. If not? It has obviously been nice, being up there and trying to compete for it.\u201d In short, Willett isn\u2019t the type to shout from rooftops. McIlroy won\u2019t readily dismiss Willett\u2019s threat. The pair played together at last week\u2019s Turkish Airlines Open, which gave the four-time major winner a close-up opportunity to watch Willett\u2019s well-rounded and continually improving game.

Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cDanny has been playing well for a while now,\u201d McIlroy acknowledged. \u201cI always knew it was going to be tough; even though I had a slight lead in the Race to Dubai, there were so many guys who were close enough. Especially with the big prize funds in these events. \u201cI knew I was going to have to play well to win it. I still am going to have to play well.\u201d This has been a curious McIlroy year, started in such impressive fashion but punctured by an ankle injury. He denies any notion of 2015 being akin to 2013 when he also failed to return a major championship. Or, indeed, extra incentive for next year now prevailing. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was my lack of game or form that kept me from winning a major,\u201d McIlroy explained. \u201cI felt like it was there and it just didn\u2019t quite happen. Whereas in \u201913, I played crap. That was really it. \u201cSo I\u2019m not as frustrated as I would have been in \u201913 because I know my game is at the level it needs to be to win majors. It\u2019s just a matter of going out and doing it. The injury kept me out of at least one major and then I was still rehabbing it at the same time whenever I played in the USPGA. \u201cI\u2019m motivated just like I would be motivated any other year to go out and try and play the majors well next year, and try and get another couple in the bag.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s first round of 68 on the outskirts of Shanghai would probably have been acceptable on Thursday morning, the former world No1 having spent the previous two days suffering from food poisoning. There were three consecutive missed opportunities on his closing stretch, though, which prompted frustration. McIlroy revealed his illness had triggered a 10lbs weight loss. \u201cI stepped on the scales, I shouldn\u2019t have done it but I\u2019m under 70 kilos now for the first time in a long time,\u201d he said. \u201c150lbs, 68 kilos. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was this light. I think it is more a case of rehydration now. Or a few burgers maybe, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Adam Scott was hardly forthcoming on the release of a book by his part-time caddie, Steve Williams. The tome has inevitably created headlines, given Williams\u2019 earlier and lengthy association with Tiger Woods.\u201cI haven\u2019t read it,\u201d said Scott, who doesn\u2019t have Williams on the bag in China. The Australian also refuted the possibility of this work being a distraction at future events, such as majors, where Williams appears. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, although I don\u2019t know exactly what is in the book,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think not.

I\u2019m hopefully going to get off to a good start tomorrow then show some patience towards the end of the round. I\u2019m pleased with a nine under par round anywhere. For the most part it was about ball-striking. I didn\u2019t put myself in much trouble.

Players would instead have to compete in five standard tournaments, such as national opens, to retain full status on\u00a0the tour and so be eligible for a Ryder Cup place. As things stand, professionals must feature 13 times each year to remain as European Tour members and qualify for the biennial contest against the United States. Four WGC events and the same number of majors can count in that figure, which affords a clear benefit to those ranked inside the world\u2019s top 50. The tour\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, Keith Pelley, has spent a significant part of his first 10 weeks in office in discussions with leading players and other stakeholders about the fairest possible membership scenario. Pelley will announce his plans immediately before the European Tour season concludes at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, later this month. Three options are understood to be on the table: Pelley could surprisingly decide to retain the status quo; he could simply and marginally reduce the number of counting tournaments; or he could opt for the five-event plan. The final option is regarded as the clear frontrunner but the decision is not set in stone. Such a shift would have clear benefits. Players who fall outside the top 50 at the start of a season could set their schedule to include five European Tour events without the uncertainty of having to factor in tournaments they may or may not be a part of. It would presumably be hoped such a policy would appeal to players such as Paul Casey, who, for now, has membership only of the PGA Tour, having cited problems with planning a dual schedule. Casey, ordinarily, would come into the reckoning for a place on Darren Clarke\u2019s team for the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine in Minnesota next September. Europe\u2019s top players, who compete in the United States, would have the advantage of the Ryder Cup and Olympic Games forming two of the five counting events in 2016. Even during 2017, they are unlikely to regard five tournaments in Europe as a heavy burden, as it does not represent a material difference to now. A broader wish would be the attraction of European Tour membership to American players such as Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler, who have already displayed a willingness to travel. \u201cWe no longer have European Tour players and PGA Tour players,\u201d said Pelley, pointedly, in China last week. \u201cWe have global players.\u201d In Dubai, Pelley will also unveil the latest adjustments to the European Tour\u2019s lucrative Final Series. Spieth, meanwhile, admitted to shock after a third round of 63 that catapulted him into contention at the WGC-HSBC Champions. He will begin round four just three shots off the lead. The Masters and US Open winner arrived in Shanghai after a fortnight\u2019s break from golf. \u201cThis will be the first and only time I would say this, but I was not expecting to be in this position on Sunday when the week started,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI came in with very little confidence in my trust of what I am trying to do in my swing.\u201d At 15 under par, Dustin Johnson is another notable name on a leaderboard that is headed by Kevin Kisner on minus 16. Johnson is seeking his second WGC success of 2015, having triumphed at Doral in March. Russell Knox, who sits on the same aggregate as Johnson, will return at 7.45am on Sunday to play the 18th hole. The Scot, who is playing in his first WGC tournament, opted not to complete his third round when given the option in poor light. Rory McIlroy was delighted with the \u201c100%\u201d state of his health on day three, but not so with his putting after signing for a 68.

The slowdown in China\u2019s economic expansion has sent jitters across global stock markets and was cited in September by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as a reason for delaying the long-expected rise interest rates.   Related: US Federal Reserve is right to raise interest rates, yet risk remains    But although the weak trade figures may again cast doubt on the chances of a rate rise in December, one of her colleagues has called for the Fed to start the so-called \u201clift-off\u201d after keeping raising rates at near zero for seven years.       \u201cMy forecast is that we\u2019ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the near future and I\u2019m increasingly confident that inflation will gradually move back to our 2% goal,\u201d San Francisco Federal Reserve bank president John Williams said in a speech in Arizona.  \u201cIt makes sense, therefore, to start gradually moving away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here,\u201d added Williams, who was Yellen\u2019s chief researcher when she had his job before moving to Washington. Traders boosted their bets on such a move after a US government report on Friday showed the economy added many more jobs than expected in October, sending the jobless rate down to 5%, close to or at full employment.  But the latest figures from China could make them think again. Imports fell 9.8% to $130.77bn in October, the 12th consecutive monthly drop in imports, following a 20.4% decrease in September. Exports, too, continued their losing streak from July, dropping by 6.4% year-on-year in October to $192.41bn as foreign demand languished, according to figures from the general administration of customs. Purchases of raw materials such as crude oil and soybeans went up in quantity, but China paid far less for the goods than a year ago because of lower prices. However, China cut back on purchases of coal, steel, copper and aluminum, in a sign of sluggish economy. Coal imports, for example, have dropped almost 30% on volume and 40% on value over the first ten months of the year, the data showed. The October trade surplus rose to $61.64bn, driven by the continued drop in imports, the data showed, suggesting that the Asian giant continues to struggle with improving domestic demand. It was also bad news for resource-rich countries such as Australia and Brazil for whom the world\u2019s biggest trader country is a crucial client. China\u2019s sluggish property market, overcapacity in the manufacturing sector and slowed government spending in infrastructure have contributed to the country\u2019s economic slowdown and contribute to decreasing demand for such commodities as coal and iron ore, used in heavy industry. Beijing aims to rebalance the economy to a sustainable model where expansion is predominantly driven by domestic consumer demand, but the transition is proving bumpy.   Related: Apocalypse now: has the next giant financial crash already begun?    Botched stock exchange interventions and a sudden currency devaluation in August have rattled confidence in the country\u2019s leadership, whose legitimacy rests on maintaining an aura of economic infallibility. Last week, Chinese equities entered a bull market, with the Shanghai Composite Index rising over 20% since the end of August, a hopeful signal that investor confidence is on the upswing and could drive increasing consumer confidence. Chinese president Xi Jinping this month said annual expansion should be no less than 6.5% in 2016-2020 if the country is to double GDP and incomes compared to 2010 levels by the end of the decade. The comments are the clearest indication yet that Beijing will reduce its target growth rate from the current \u201caround seven percent\u201d, after expansion slowed in the July-September period to 6.9 percent, its slowest pace in six years.", "tags": ["Chinese economy", "Federal Reserve", "Janet Yellen", "US economy", "Business", "Economics", "Australian economy", "China"], "publicationDate": "2015-11-08T05:18:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/08/chantal-akerman-now-review-ambika-p3-life-and-death", "sentences": ["In Shanghai, as dusk falls, waitresses begin their ceaseless circling of the city\u2019s cafes, passing to and fro in the sickly glow before Akerman\u2019s locked-off camera."], "title": "Chantal Akerman: NOW review \u2013 flickering between life and death", "article": "The Belgian-born film-maker Chantal Akerman died in Paris last month at the age of 65. According to Le Monde, she took her own life. Shocked obituaries have appeared all over the world, with the result that many more people now know about Akerman\u2019s death than her life\u2019s work, which is extraordinarily diverse, original and inventive. Her filmography includes adaptations of Proust and Conrad, conventional comedies starring William Hurt, documentaries, biopics, travelogues and political essays, as well as wildly radical departures such as the film that made her name in 1975, Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, a mesmerising portrait of a young widow turned prostitute frequently described as a masterpiece of European cinema. No doubt there will be lifetime surveys to come, although the ICA has only just finished screening 40 films over two years. In the meantime, there are plentiful DVDs and YouTube clips. But these mainly present her cinema films, rather than the strange and pioneering visions Akerman unleashed in art galleries down the decades, seven of which are now on show at Ambika P3 in a gathering that is beautiful, intimate, bleak and very nearly overwhelming.         Chantal Akerman\u2019s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles    If you have tears, prepare to shed them in front of the very first film in the gallery, made when Akerman was 21. In the Mirror shows a young girl inspecting herself in the looking glass. We see her from behind, as well as from the front in reflection. It is the classic disparity. She sees somebody with no waist, awkward ears, too small a head and too many blemishes, as she declares; we see a ravishingly beautiful young woman. The viewer is filled with tenderness for this child who can scarcely see how lovely she is in all her ruthless self-criticism, asserting \u201cher right to be the author of herself\u201d, to quote the 70s rhetoric. The inner-outer split grows increasingly poignant.    The viewer is filled with tenderness for this child who can scarcely see how lovely she is    It is a short piece for Akerman \u2013 a few minutes, compared to Jeanne Dielman, which unfolds over more than three hours. But the subsequent films here amount to a prolonged immersion in the lives of untold women. In Shanghai, as dusk falls, waitresses begin their ceaseless circling of the city\u2019s cafes, passing to and fro in the sickly glow before Akerman\u2019s locked-off camera. On the sidewalks of New York, immigrant street sellers, surreptitiously viewed through a doorway, somehow keep their spirits up as the world walks on by. In Arizona, on the Mexican border, a huge screen shows what amounts to a haunted road movie \u2013 Akerman\u2019s car streaming through the desert to a place with no name, which neither the film nor the wetbacks she is commemorating on the soundtrack will ever reach. It is a meditation on all those nameless migrants who would one day clean the houses on the other side if only they hadn\u2019t suddenly, and mysteriously, disappeared. Nobody ever makes it home.     A visitor to Ambika P3 watching In the Mirror, 2007, a remastering of Akerman\u2019s 1971 film, L\u2019enfant aim\u00e9 ou je joue \u00e0 \u00eatre une femme mari\u00e9e. Photograph: Sara Cuono/Ambika P3/Sara Cuono    The narrative voice in each case is Akerman\u2019s own \u2013 lyrical and low, casting its own kind of music over these enthralling observations of other people\u2019s lives. She is more than director, more than auteur, frequently appearing in her own scenes. In some profound sense, each work is a self-portrait by other means, shot through with a burning appreciation of life \u2013 and a fierce sense of death, most piercingly that of her mother. Nelly Akerman survived Auschwitz, and the relationship between mother and daughter, precious and deep, turns upon that anguished miracle. Nelly never speaks of it, Chantal always wonders about it; and they do eventually come at it very obliquely in Akerman\u2019s No Home Movie (with its double meaning), in conversations recorded in the older woman\u2019s Brussels flat in the months before her death. That is a cinema film; at Ambika P3 you can see Maniac Shadows, a five-part installation that incorporates fragments from both women\u2019s lives, juxtaposed with a wall of photographs showing women on the tube, in the restroom, in the lobby \u2013 strange places where they are neither at work nor at home: a no woman\u2019s land. And in another room (metaphorically, as well as literally) is the filmed portrait of Nelly: an old woman now, waiting for the cleaning lady to come but not quite sure if it is today or tomorrow that this will happen, struggling to answer the telephone, to read, move or converse; a woman living in a vagueness she can no longer gather into any meaning, structure or purpose. It is a tremendous and harrowing portrait, Akerman\u2019s voiceover caressing her mother\u2019s fragile shadow on screen.     Akerman\u2019s mother, Nelly, in No Home Movie, 2015. Photograph: \u00a9 Chantal Akerman    And the accompanying photographs gradually take on another significance, apparently imitating the vagaries of memory. Here was something (or someone) important at that very snapshot moment, its meaning now lost. What on earth was it that mattered so much? Maniac Summer shows Akerman alone in her Manhattan flat, extremely anxious \u2013 or is it the film that shudders with nerves? Time is ticking away on screen. It August 2009, 8pm and the artist is smoking incessantly. Barack Obama appears on television, blinking, uncertain, not yet presidential. Street scenes show an eerie underpass, cars flashing past in the growing dusk; while the camera in the flat remains static, like another piece of furniture. In the park, in black and white, there is a sense of anticipation, a frisson something like the breeze shivering through the grass in Antonioni\u2019s Blow-Up. Then the scene shifts into colour and the fear increases. All of these works are concerned, to some degree, with different kinds of film stock, colour, angle and technique \u2013 with picture-making at its most formal, but also dramatic. Akerman is capable of filming net curtains, lifting slightly, as if they were weeping.     D\u2019est (From the East), 1993: \u2018each face is held by our eyes\u2019. Photograph: \u00a9 Chantal Akerman    One of the most famous works here, D\u2019est (1993), is a 24-strong assembly of monitors showing figures from her travels through Eastern Europe. Men and women wait by the road, black forms in the fog, or huddle with their few possessions in the dim-lit underground. Visions of figures trudging through white winters, as if in war or its aftermath, pass across these screens. It is an argument against uniformity \u2013 each face is held by our eyes, looking back at us in turn \u2013 but Akerman\u2019s words are almost more compelling. If you didn\u2019t know her work, you might think this was a fiction, a Beckett narrative accompanied by pictures. There are only two things, she says \u2013 life, and not. Akerman\u2019s final work, NOW, was an extreme departure: five screens showing the desert hurtling towards and around the viewer, to a soundtrack of pure but muffled violence. In the chaos of rumbling, shooting, shattering noise, the ear struggles to pick out birdsong above the raging horror. Variations of speed, stock and colour suggest vast worlds in themselves, and the trauma to eye and ear is overpowering, although not a single word is spoken. In D\u2019est, Akerman talked of trying to create what was for her a primal scene \u2013 a flickering between life and death, the instant before being snatched from this world. There is no doubt that she achieved it here.

What followed is the stuff of sporting fairytale. Knox, from his previous position of seventh reserve, stood with arms aloft on the 18th green at the Sheshan club after delivering Scotland\u2019s first success at a World Golf Championship event. He had never even played in one of these tournaments before. The 30-year-old\u2019s nerveless closing round of 68 was all the more impressive given the calibre of chaser; Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy were among those who could not keep pace with him. \u201cWinning any professional tournament is a massive accomplishment, you\u2019re never quite sure if you\u2019re ever going to do it because there\u2019s so many incredible players throughout the world, especially at tournaments like this with such an elite field,\u201d Knox said. \u201cTo come and be on top this week is a dream come true. I still can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m here. I was quite calm. But at the same time, that was the most nerve-wracking thing I have ever done.\u201d   Related: European Tour looks to ease burden on players with radical shakeup of membership    Knox\u2019s wife, Andrea, had spent a frantic day filling out visa forms to allow her husband to travel to China. While she was rightly afforded high praise, Knox offered emotional sentiment towards Mike Flemming, his influential college coach who died from lung failure two years ago. \u201cI thought about him throughout the day,\u201d Knox admitted. \u201cI thought about him on the 18th when I had to tap-in to win and my eyes started tearing up. I owe him everything. He was my coach for eight years, he has been my inspiration and he taught me everything I know. It finally paid off.\u201d Knox has threatened such a win for a while. He has now delivered the finest moment for Scottish men\u2019s golf since Paul Lawrie won the 1999 Open Championship. It is a much-needed boost. Knox was a junior member at Nairn Dunbar and later Inverness golf clubs in the Highlands before emigrating to attend Jacksonville University in Florida. By his own admission, he never enjoyed anything remotely resembling a stellar amateur career, save the Four Day Open at Inverness. \u201cMy age group, for some reason, didn\u2019t really achieve [in golf] and I don\u2019t know why that is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if some of the players would have come to the US and played in college, they would have become better players.\u201d Steady progression through minor events in the United States was followed by the claiming of a PGA Tour card, conditionally in 2012 and on a full-time basis two years later. Until now, and amid several close shaves, all that eluded this understated but eloquent player was a victory. Now, Knox will rise to around 30th in the world and has banked a cheque for \u00a3930k. A first US Masters appearance has been sealed for April. Suddenly, he is part of a Ryder Cup discussion, but for that to become reality Knox will need to take out membership of the European Tour. \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a goal of mine to make the European Ryder Cup team and this springboards me to a place where obviously yesterday I was nowhere near,\u201d Knox added. \u201cI have no idea where I stand on making the team or what I need to do. But I look forward to finding out and giving it a run, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d     Fans take pictures of Russell Knox after his triumph. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters    Kevin Kisner\u2019s birdie at the 72nd hole handed him sole possession of second place. It also denied Danny Willett the opportunity to leapfrog Rory McIlroy in the European Tour\u2019s order of merit. Willett, who shared third with Ross Fisher, will have another chance to do precisely that at this week\u2019s BMW Masters in Shanghai. The 28-year-old Willett heads to Lake Malaren in fine fettle, having signed off with a 62 here. \u201cThat was special,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is special shooting 62 at home with the lads. But in a World Golf Championship, on a Sunday, when it means something a bit more, obviously it is that little bit more special.\u201d Spieth\u2019s 70 handed him a share of seventh. McIlroy produced his best round of the week, a 66, to tie 11th. \u201cI know Danny is playing next week and I\u2019m not, so no matter what happened today, he had a good chance to overtake me next week,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI\u2019m just going with the mindset that I need to go to Dubai for the final event and win.

The OECD said in a report that global trade flows have fallen dangerously close to levels usually associated with a global recession, although steps taken by China and others should ensure a pick-up in 2016.

Its mission? To begin delivering 760m parcels expected to be ordered during a 24-hour orgy of spending that is described as the world\u2019s greatest online shopping fiesta. Singles\u2019 Day \u2013 or Double Eleven, as most Chinese call it in reference to the day on which it falls \u2013 was reputedly started on 11 November 1993 by singleton students who were seeking an excuse to buy themselves presents. Today it is a Chinese institution, creating work for hundreds of thousands of green-uniformed postal workers and vast sums of money for Alibaba, the retail giant credited with turning the day into a commercial phenomenon. When Alibaba decided to launch an annual online sale on Singles\u2019 Day 2009, just 27 merchants took part, slashing their prices for the duration of the 24-hour promotion.  Since then the event\u2019s growth, like much in modern China, has been astounding and it now eclipses both the US\u2019s Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Last year 27,000 merchants took part, with Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce sites generating $9.3bn (\u00a36.1bn) in sales.  This year, despite concerns over the overall health of the Chinese economy, Singles\u2019 Day is again predicted to hit new heights. Ninety per cent of respondents in a poll carried out by China\u2019s Jinan University and the Information Times newspaper said they would take part by snapping up bargains. Lu Zhenwang, an e-commerce analyst from Shanghai, said he expected a record 100 million people to take part in this year\u2019s online shopping binge, the majority aged between 20 and 40. \u201c[Shoppers come] from all parts of China: every province, every city and even every county town,\u201d he said.  Oceanne Zhang, a Shanghai-based e-commerce expert from Kantar Retail, said she expected sales to surge 15% on last year. Part of the reason is that Singles\u2019 Day is now, in fact, no longer held on a single day. Some Chinese e-commerce sites have been offering heavily discounted items for a week now, on the condition that they are paid for on 11 November.  Zhang said one day was insufficient time for most people to fulfil their bargain-hunting needs. \u201cIt\u2019s [only] 24 hours. You have to work for eight hours and you have to sleep for six hours. They wanted better [results] this year so they started earlier, will last longer, will have a bigger impact and, of course, will make more transactions happen,\u201d she said. Another factor driving booming sales is the rapid spread of smartphones, of which there are now more than 910m in China. That has allowed the Double Eleven buying phenomenon to spread right across the country, Zhang said.  China\u2019s wealthy eastern coast and south have traditionally been the source of most online orders. \u201cBut the key change we have seen this year is that some rural areas are increasing their number of transactions very, very rapidly. Everybody is talking about rural e-commerce.\u201d Alibaba says this year\u2019s Double Eleven shopping spree is also going to be the most international yet. A record number of foreign brands \u2013 including Burberry, Estee Lauder, Nike, Topshop and Uniqlo \u2013 will take part by hawking their wares on Alibaba sites such as Tmall.  \u201cEleven/Eleven is going global,\u201d Daniel Zhang, the company\u2019s chief executive, boasted in an interview with Fortune magazine. \u201cChinese consumers will be buying an unprecedented assortment of international brands and products from around the world. Chinese consumers associate quality and prestige with American and European brands, and both have very solid presence on 11/11 in response to strong consumer demand.\u201d Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s chairman and founder, said the event was more than \u201cjust the largest shopping day in the world\u201d. He said: \u201cThis festival is a thermometer for the Chinese economy.\u201d Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC Business School, said observers would look to Singles\u2019 Day results for clues about the state of China\u2019s overall economy. But he cautioned against reading too much into the outcome, particularly since those splashing their cash were likely to represent a younger, single, internet-savvy cross-section of Chinese society. \u201cEverybody is looking for something they can hang their hat on that this is what is going on with the Chinese economy. Whether it is awful or whether it is wonderful, I\u2019m personally a little sceptical that this would be a good benchmark for what is going on in the Chinese economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is negative growth I think that would be a very concerning thing, but even then I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.\u201d Alibaba appears to be gearing up for a bumper year. The Hangzhou-based company has built an \u201c11/11 command centre\u201d in Beijing and will throw a glitzy gala at the city\u2019s Olympic Water Cube stadium on Tuesday night to kick off proceedings. The US singer Adam Lambert and the Chinese actress Zhao Wei are among those expected to attend the festivities, which will be televised and streamed online. China\u2019s communist founder Mao Zedong might be turning in his mausoleum at the unabashed display of capitalist excess. But Double Eleven celebrations are likely to please the country\u2019s current rulers who are seeking to wean China\u2019s economy off its addiction to state investment and exports, partly by encouraging consumers to spend, spend, spend. China\u2019s latest five-year economic plan, details of which emerged this week, outlines a goal of \u201ca more sustainable and balanced way of development\u201d, with annual growth targets of at least 6.5%. Not everyone is impressed with the furore around Singles\u2019 Day. In an interview with the Qingdao Morning Post, one man lamented how in recent years his wife had frittered away 130,000 yuan (\u00a313,500) of their hard-earned savings on Double Eleven purchases \u2013 thus dashing their dreams of buying a new home. As millions of shoppers prepared to click their way to consumer happiness, the man, named only as Mr Cao, was left with nothing but bitterness and regret. \u201cOur plan didn\u2019t work out because my wife overspent online,\u201d he complained.

Interest from five buyers pushed the price for Nu Couch\u00e9 far above the previous $71m record auction price for the Italian artist. The sale also made the painting the second most expensive artwork ever sold at auction and is one of only 10 pieces of art to sell for a nine-figure sum.

Having dropped out of school, he started his professional life selling handbags on the street and then drove a taxi. He later went on to make billions on the Chinese stock market in the 1980s and 90s, trading in real estate and pharmaceuticals.  According to the 2015 Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Liu is worth at least $1.5bn. It is estimated the collector has spent more than $100m on his collection just in the past year. His taste in art ranges from ancient Chinese scrolls and imperial ceramics to contemporary western artists such as Jeff Koons and has so far filled his two museums with more than 2,300 pieces of art. At an auction at Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong in 2014, he bought a 15th-century silk hanging for $45m, setting a new international record for the auction house.  Liu and his wife Wang Wei have raised eyebrows in China for their extravagant spending, particularly in light of President Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on corruption in recent years. He was the subject of a recent online scandal after a photograph of him drinking tea out of an antique bowl he had recently purchased for $36m went viral on the internet.  Liu has openly spoken of his ambitions to create a Chinese museum that could rival the Guggenheim or MoMA in New York but has admitted that he has no idea how much his 2,300-strong collection is worth. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this year, he said: \u201cIt must be a very, very huge figure, but I don\u2019t give it much thought, because I won\u2019t be selling the collection. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the value, nor do I care about the money I spent buying it in the first place.\u201d Reclining Nude will be the most expensive piece in Liu\u2019s collection.

Today, the Red Sea separates the coasts of Egypt, Sudan and Eritrea to the west from those of Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the east. It contains some of the world\u2019s warmest and saltiest seawater. With hot sunny days and little rainfall, dust storms from the surrounding deserts frequently sweep across the sea. This hot dry climate causes high levels of sea evaporation, which leads to the Red Sea\u2019s high salinity. Its name derives from the colour changes in the waters. Normally, the Red Sea is an intense blue\u2013green. Occasionally, however, extensive algae blooms form and when they die off they turn the sea a reddish-brown colour.

Mexico International airport is also visible, and further along the dark green rectangle is the massive reservoir of Lake Nabor Carrillo.  Mexico City sits in the Valley of Mexico, surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, with elevations reaching beyond 5,000 metres. The city rests mainly on the heavily saturated clay of what used to be Lake Texcoco. This soft base is collapsing through the over-extraction of groundwater, and the city has sunk as much as nine metres in some areas since the beginning of the 20th century.

They smolder under the surface for long periods, often for months. Usually, firefighters can only put them out with the help of downpours during the rainy season. And they release far more smoke and air pollution than most other types of fires. Peat fires start to burn in Indonesia every year because farmers engage in \u201cslash and burn agriculture,\u201d a technique that involves frequent burning of rainforest to clear the way for crops or grazing animals. In Indonesia, the intent is often to make room for new plantings of oil palm and acacia pulp. \u201cMost burning starts on idle, already-cleared peatlands and escapes underground into an endless source of fuel,\u201d explained David Gaveau of the Center for International Forestry Research.

Below the ocean\u2019s surface, the deeper pool of warm water has reduced the usual upwelling of deep water nutrients to the surface of the Eastern Pacific. This is evident from a decline in sea surface chlorophyll, the green pigment that indicates the presence of phytoplankton. With less phytoplankton available, fish that feed upon plankton, as well the bigger fish that feed on them, have a greatly reduced food supply. Although this El Ni\u00f1o has not yet reached its peak, in past events of this magnitude, the decline in fish stocks led to many marine animals \u2013 including Galapagos penguins, marine iguanas, sea lions and seals \u2013 experiencing famine and dramatic population declines. The globes above compare sea surface chlorophyll in the Pacific Ocean as observed in October 2014 (right) and 2015 (left).

The Agassiz and Libbey glaciers are visible on the left side, and the Hayden and Marvine glaciers are on the right. The brown lines on the ice are moraines \u2013 areas where soil, rock, and other debris have been scraped up by the glacier and deposited at its sides. Glaciers that flow at a steady speed tend to have moraines that are relatively straight. But what causes the dizzying pattern of curves, zigzags, and loops of Malaspina\u2019s moraines? Glaciers in this area of Alaska periodically \u201csurge\u201d, meaning they lurch forward quickly for one to several years. As a result, the moraines at the edges and between glaciers can become folded, compressed, and sheared to form the characteristic loops seen on Malaspina.

China\u2019s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of overall credit in the economy, fell 63% to 476.7bn yuan in October ($73bn) from 1.3 trillion yuan in September, the lowest level since July 2014, data from the People\u2019s Bank of China showed.  The data follows a string of below-expectation economic releases in recent weeks and comes despite repeated attempts by the Chinese government to stimulate lending, including six cuts in interests rates in the past 12 months. Angus Nicholson of IG in Melbourne said: \u201cThe data was very weak and given the amount of monetary easing and increased fiscal spending we have seen in China over the past twelve months, it is concerning to see such a weak number.\u201d       Chinese banks extended 513bn yuan ($80.66bn) in net new yuan loans in October, disappointing analyst expectations and down 51% on the previous month\u2019s 1.05 trillion yuan. \u201cIn general liquidity continues to be quite tight despite many rounds of easing,\u201d said Kevin Lai, economist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. \u201cThere\u2019s very little demand for investment so it\u2019s basically weak on both demand and supply sides.\u201d  Meanwhile, a number of Fed officials lined up on Thursday behind a likely rise in interest rates from their historic near-zero levels, bookending a seven-year stretch of unprecedentedly cheap credit for the world economy.        Stanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s second-in-command, said US inflation should rebound next year, noting that the central bank could move next month to raise interest rates.  New York Fed president William Dudley said the risk of waiting too long was now roughly in balance with the risk of moving too soon to normalise rates. In a sign of rising market stress, the CBOE volatility index rose to a one-month high of 18.50. The dollar index, which tracks the US currency against a basket of six of its major peers, edged back from Tuesday\u2019s seven-month high of 99.50 to last trade at 98.682.

But it has prompted lamentation in the Italian artist\u2019s hometown of Livorno, whose mayor said the painting should to have been bought by Italy instead. \u201cI am displeased that it went to a private person because I think it should have been given to a museum so that it could be seen by everyone. Its beauty could have affected many people and now that may not happen,\u201d Filippo Nogarin said. The mayor \u2013 who claimed the Tuscan port city of Livorno had a \u201cvisceral love\u201d for the 20th-century artist whose nudes were once considered scandalous because of their explicit sexuality \u2013 said Monday\u2019s sale of Nu Couch\u00e9, or Reclining Nude, to Liu Yiqian, a former taxi driver, had been a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for Italy. Nogarin is a member of the populist Five Star Movement.    Related: Modigliani painting sells to Chinese billionaire for record breaking $170m    Pointing to a recent controversy over the planned lease of a new Airbus A330 for use by the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, Nogarin said Italy would have been making a wiser investment if it had purchased the painting and kept it in Italian hands. \u201cI would have preferred one more Modigliani and one less aeroplane,\u201d he said. The Modigliani nude became one of only 10 pieces of art to sell for a nine-figure sum following its auction by Christie\u2019s this week. While Nogarin expressed fears that the fate of the painting and the public\u2019s future access to it were unknown, the Chinese buyer plans to exhibit the work in one of two private museums he owns in Shanghai. Liu told the New York Times the work, described by Christie\u2019s as \u201can overtly sexual, highly erotic painting yet also one that is subtle, elegant, tender, loving and extraordinarily refined\u201d, would be put on exhibit for his museum\u2019s fifth anniversary. It was not clear whether it would have a permanent home there. \u201cIt will be an opportunity for Chinese art lovers to see good artworks without having to leave the country, which is one of the main reasons why we founded the museums,\u201d he said. The 52-year-old collector and middle school dropout made his fortune on the Chinese stock market in the 80s and 90s. In a 2013 video interview with the New York Times, he said his museum would serve as an important protector of China\u2019s rich cultural history. \u201cThe price of art cannot be separated from a country\u2019s status in the world. It\u2019s two sides of the same coin,\u201d he said. Modigliani was Italian but Nu Couch\u00e9 was initially owned by the artist\u2019s Polish-born poet and patron, L\u00e9opold Zborowski, who lived in Paris. Liu\u2019s views about the value of art and its importance to a country\u2019s cultural history is shared by the Livorno mayor. \u201cLivorno has a strange relationship with Modigliani. It\u2019s a visceral love and then also a sense of guilt because Modigliani left Livorno as a young man,\u201d Nogarin said. \u201cModigliani is celebrated a lot here ... the painting could have become a [local] attraction.

We are certainly more sceptical than the generation of modernist architects of the 1930s who retreated to a cruise liner sailing across the Mediterranean to lay the ground for the Charter of Athens, the document that codified a city made up of parallel slabs of housing rising out of parkland, and where work, home and leisure were divided by functional zoning. And yet, 43 years after the dynamiting of the Pruitt Igoe social housing project in St Louis \u2013 an event that was widely seen as emblematic of the end of certainty about how the state could address the needs of the city \u2013 there is a hunger for a more positive approach to what cities could be. The rapid growth of new megacities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, and the urgent need to revitalise European and American cities, has left no option but to find ways of addressing the wider questions facing urbanism. How can cities accommodate more people without destroying the very qualities that make them attractive to people in the first place? How can they offer more social justice and opportunity?    80% of the Earth&#39;s land surface has come to reflect the influence of city-based human activity. #UrbanAge10 #tbt pic.twitter.com/k5WQ1qVaQ0&mdash; LSE Cities (@LSECities) September 17, 2015    The Urban Age programme was born 10 years ago in the belief that the time had come to do more, in so far as such things are possible in the scrupulous world of academic research, than simply to reflect and observe. Working with its partner, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Alfred Herrhausen Society, LSE Cities set up the Urban Age as a kind of mobile think-tank: the idea was not simply to gather data to map what the city was becoming, but to bring together all the players who so rarely find themselves in conversation with each other, yet who collectively represent the multiple and often conflicting directions of the forces that shape cities.  It is a project based on the belief that the city is shaped not just by the thinkers \u2013 the academic planners and theorists, the sociologists and demographers \u2013 but also by the politicians and developers who get their hands dirty building to win votes and make a return on their investment, along with a third group: the professionals \u2013 the architects, planners and engineers. In this last category, we should not forget the police and the judiciary who try, and sometimes fail, to keep the city safe and incorruptible.    The smart city concept has turned into a banal marketing tool, but digital technologies are changing the way cities work    The way that cities are governed relies on legal systems as well as political boundaries. Keeping them moving relies on the insights of traffic planners, and transport commissioners, on economic analysis infrastructure investment and waste management policies. All of these interact, and social justice depends on all of them aligning. In itself, this idea that the city is the product of such different groups is probably the biggest single ideological statement represented by the Urban Age. In the course of the past 10 years, the urban landscape has changed radically. We have duly fulfilled the United Nations predictions contained in successive State of the World Population reports; we are indeed a majority urban species for the first time in human history. Now we must face the consequences in the increasingly divided cities of the rich world. In New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, housing has turned into an investment asset with a resultant, highly destructive impact on the vitality of city life. The \u201csmart city\u201d concept may have turned into a banal marketing tool, but digital technologies really are changing the way that cities work. On the positive side, initiatives such as Transport for London\u2019s decision to make its data on the position of every bus and train on its network available free in real time has made possible such game changers as the City Mapper App, that makes us understand the cities in which we live in ways that were never previously possible. On the other hand, one of the essential qualities of urbanity is privacy and anonymity. The indelible digital trail left by a GPS changes all that.     Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, the mayor of Bogot\u00e1, explained to Urban Age why he was investing in dedicated bus lanes rather than heavy rail commuter systems Photograph: Diana Sanchez/AFP/Getty    Cities are also the first places to feel the results of the migration from conflict zones. They are subject to waves of anxiety about their security, challenged by terrorism, civil unrest and continuing racial tension. When the Urban Age staged its first conference in New York in February 2005, the language used to discuss cities was already changing. The Republicans had decided there were no votes in the inner cities, and had abandoned them. But after decades of decline, New York was bouncing back from its low point of near bankruptcy. Rem Koolhaas, the acerbic Dutch architect and theorist, managed to upset a room full of New York activists by suggesting that this was not an entirely welcome development. Jane Jacobs\u2019s pioneering challenge to big picture planning had, he suggested, ended up with squeaky clean denatured streets. It was, he asserted, the ultimate irony that she had become the intellectual underpinning for Disneyland.    Urban Age is based on the idea that urbanism is both physical and legal, about economics, politics and the market    There were urban success stories to explore, and not just the inevitable case of Barcelona. Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, charismatic mayor of Bogot\u00e1, reflected on his traffic-taming plans for the city that reclaimed the streets for the poor, and investing not in heavy rail commuter systems that were beyond his resources, but in dedicated bus lanes.  Looking back over the 10 years, it\u2019s remarkable how much the host cities (after New York, Shanghai, then London, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Berlin, Mumbai, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Chicago, Hong Kong, London again, Rio and Delhi) have changed, and how much the challenges facing them have developed. The congestion charge was still a novelty in London in 2005, having been introduced just two years earlier. Michael Bloomberg had just been elected to the second of his three terms in office, and failed to win the backing of New Yorkers to bring the charge to Manhattan. Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5 had yet to open. Now Britain is paralysed with indecision about a new runway for London. Standing on the roof of an art-deco wedding cake on Shanghai\u2019s Bund, after the end of the second Urban Age conference of 2005, Pudong\u2019s skyline was still missing two ultra-tall high rises more than 500 metres high that now define the cityscape. As the conference broke up, news came through that London would be staging the Olympics in 2012, followed shortly after by the reports of a suicide bomb attack on the Underground.    #HongKong is one of a few cities that remains consistently dense when leaving the city centre. #UrbanAge10 #tbt pic.twitter.com/Ihki3BLf1Q&mdash; LSE Cities (@LSECities) September 10, 2015    Urban Age was established to find new ways to think about cities. It was based on the idea that urbanism was both physical and legal, about economics and politics, and also about the market. The issue was that these were groups of people with little in common, and indeed without much respect for each other\u2019s point of view.  The conferences set out to get these people talking. They got Ian Blair in the same room in Berlin as Angela Merkel when, as Metropolitan Police commissioner, he defined London\u2019s boundaries as stretching as far as Jamaica and Baghdad.  Now the conversation continues with a series of five special events at the LSE, starting this week with Nick Stern leading a panel that, in the build-up to the UN climate conference in Paris, seeks to understand the crucial role cities play in addressing the threat of climate change.   Related: A tale of four world cities \u2013 London, Delhi, Tokyo and Bogot\u00e1 compared    Over the years, the Urban Age agenda has crystallised. It offers a multifaceted view of what constitutes a city, based on government and economics, law, sociology and planning, but with an injection of architecture and urbanism \u2013 and seeks to create an accommodation between all these actors. It is a process that created tensions. The moment that Richard Sennett asked Johannesburg\u2019s authorities to consider how they might make the city\u2019s suburban trains a less dangerous place was a confrontation the politicians had not expected. Indeed, you could see politicians everywhere getting anxious about architects who tried to tell them how useful as an urban model the underground passageways of Tokyo were, when they knew perfectly well that their electorates would see them as nothing short of monstrous.  The Urban Age has long argued for an understanding, and a better integration of the multiple layers of government \u2013 city- as well as borough-wide, national as well as regional. In so many places, the mismatch between these various layers leaves permanent scars, and discontinuities. And it continues to explore how best we can work with our cities, whether to retrofit or rebuild, to centralise or devolve. There are always different answers to these questions \u2013 which shows how important it is to keep asking them. Urban Age is a worldwide investigation into the future of cities, organised by LSE Cities and Deutsche Bank\u2019s Alfred Herrhausen Society.

Distributors Fox Star are spinning this as the highest Bollywood debut weekend ever: true, if you ignore the fact that this figure is for four days. Counted over the more typical Friday to Sunday frame, 89.3 crore actually clocks in as Bollywood\u2019s sixth strongest start, with 2014\u2019s Happy New Year (108.9 crore) and 2013\u2019s Dhoom 3 (107.6 crore) still heading the list. All this follows Indian box-office sources; rather confusing was Fox Star\u2019s claim on Sunday night, via the Rentrak chart below, that Khan\u2019s film had done $27m domestically, which would be a ridiculous 178 crore. Presumably this is a gross figure being used to create an impression of a crushing new record for Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (Indian box-office statistics, including the previous benchmarks supposedly beaten, are usually marked up net). Anyway, fixating on Bollywood does a disservice to July\u2019s Telugu blockbuster Baahubali, the broad-shouldered outsider that with 140 crore is still India\u2019s highest opener ever (whichever Prem Ratan figures you use) on a mere three-day count.             Whatever the truth, there\u2019s no doubting that \u201cSalmania\u201d is more than intact after the star\u2019s recent legal wrangles. He broke easily into the vaunted 100-crore ($15.1m) club during Eid in July with cross-border Indian-Pakistan tearjerker Bajrangi Bhaijaan (102.6 crore); the film wound up becoming Bollywood\u2019s second most successful worldwide on 626 crore. Now Prem Ratan Dhan Payo \u2013 a Prince and the Pauper-style romance in which Khan reprises the Prem naif he has played several times for director Sooraj Barjatya \u2013 has done the same for Diwali, and presumably the Hindu demographic. Its three-day Indian debut looks a little shy of Bajrangi\u2019s. The latter film, though, was especially strong overseas, and Prem is also holding its own there: the same $2.4m opening in the States; $1.5m (a Bollywood record) against Bajrangi\u2019s $1.1m in the UK. So Khan \u2013 still in the hallowed group of Indian megastars along with fellow Khans Aamir and Shah Rukh \u2013 has the ninth 100-crore film of his career, and looks a shoe-in for the Bollywood top 10 list once more.

The latter\u2019s Shanghai and Macau-set scenes, presumably a sop to local audiences, backfired when they were censored by the government. But Sony\u2019s courtship this time \u2013 a more dutiful publicity campaign that included Daniel Craig launching Singles Day for online shopping giant Alibaba \u2013 looks to have gone down better. Spectre seems to be making gains in other places where specific overtures have been made, like in opening-sequence host Mexico, whose running total ($8.3m) is already up on Skyfall\u2019s final one. Sony weren\u2019t reporting the French figures out of respect for the Paris attacks, which closed cinemas at the weekend. The overall picture for Spectre is mixed, with second-weekend totals notably down in Russia and Brazil; the kind of emerging markets Bond has his eye on. Currently at $543.8m worldwide, second place in the series\u2019 ranking is guaranteed next week, with Casino Royale\u2019s $599m within touching distance. Spectre held better than Skyfall (-50%) in the States, and if it can replicate that sort of form in the coming weeks, it may have a shot at $1bn. China may promise box-office galore, but the film faces very stiff Hollywood competition in the next fortnight there in the shape of the last Hunger Games and The Martian\u2019s sycophantically transparent Chinese plotline.  The reluctant star              Among the conclusions from the failure of Danny Boyle\u2019s Steve Jobs biopic is that Michael Fassbender is another new-generation star without much tangible commercial clout. His Jobs is another electric, fulsomely praised performance \u2013 but Fassbender has still been unable to pull in mainstream punters for a project many are speculating lacked enough interest outside the techerati. Universal\u2019s film, now on release in 13 countries, is doing no better overseas than in the States, its UK and Germany openings lagging well behind the similarly themed, Aaron Sorkin-penned The Social Network (Social Network, UK: $3.9m, Germany: $2.3m / Steve Jobs, UK: $1.4m, Germany: $650K). In terms of what the film could have done for Fassbender\u2019s A-list chances, then perhaps he won\u2019t be too upset. His filmography \u2013 heavy on firecracker arthouse leads (Hunger, Shame, Frank, Slow West, Macbeth), choice roles in big-budget ensembles (Prometheus, The Counsellor, the X-Men prequels), but with marquee blockbuster parts completely absent \u2013 suggests breaking out has not been a priority so far. Which is surprising for the leading man with perhaps the most bristling screen presence since Daniel Day-Lewis. Next year\u2019s videogame adaptation Assassin\u2019s Creed, apparently budgeted close to $200m, looks like the long-awaited push up to the next tier. Steve Jobs is no financial quantum leap (currently at $20.3m worldwide, it should see still some kind of profit before it finishes rolling out), but it won\u2019t do Fassbender\u2019s thesping credentials any harm. Beyond Hollywood            Random Chinese newcomer this week, in global 10th spot, was A Journey Through Time with Anthony: a romantic drama about three years in the life of a student heading off to an American university. It\u2019s an adaptation of a novel on the influential Zui Culture youth imprint run by Guo Jingming, whose Tiny Times series has also torn up the Chinese box office. Chilean drama The 33, in at No 11 on the strength of its $5.8m US opening, is attempting what tsunami story The Impossible did in 2012: an English-language dramatisation of an internationally covered disaster, in this case the 2010 trapping of a group of workers in the San Jos\u00e9 mine. With Antonio Banderas, Juliette Binoche, Gabriel Byrne and James Brolin adding a global-finance-tickling aspect to the cast, The 33 has already taken at least $12m outside the US.               The BBC\u2019s The Lady in the Van, starring Maggie Smith as vagrant former pianist Mary Shepherd in the screen version of Alan Bennett\u2019s play, took $3.5m in the UK for 16th place on the worldwide chart. Perhaps reflecting the more downbeat material, that\u2019s a notch down from Smith\u2019s recent openings for seniors fare Quartet ($3.6m) and The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel ($5.8m). The future              In as close to a simultaneous worldwide release as we\u2019ve had for a bit, Hunger Games closes its account with Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2 opening in over 80 territories next week. (Greece and Spain, apparently the District 13 of the global film distribution circuit, get the film seven days later.) Jennifer Lawrence and co will be hoping that Hunger Games goes out with a Harry Potter-style uptick in takings thanks to the old \u201ccleft grand-finale\u201d routine. The second dose of Deathly Hallows Part 2 made over $400m more than the first; the kind of boost Hunger Games, which dropped from Catching Fire\u2019s $865m to Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1\u2019s $755.4m, would dearly love.

The European Tour has consistently used the term \u201cflagship\u201d to describe the May competition. BMW\u2019s partnership with the tournament stems from 2005, as agreed by Pelley\u2019s predecessor, George O\u2019Grady. Speaking in Dubai, in the buildup to the DP World Tour Championship, Pelley offered a different analysis. \u201cI\u2019m telling you our flagship event, right here, is the DP World Championship which is $8m plus a bonus prize,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you couldn\u2019t say this wouldn\u2019t be our flagship event. \u201cIt [Wentworth] has a fund of \u20ac5m. It\u2019s a terrific event with wonderful fan engagement with 125,000 fans that experience the game of golf, and the way that we actually present it should be applauded. The tournament committee under Jamie Birkmyre has done just a fantastic job. But I don\u2019t see it as our flagship event.\u201d Pelley spoke confidently about challenging the status of the PGA Tour and lucrative prize pots therein. \u201cWentworth is \u20ac5m. The other event, in the US that week, is $6.7m [\u20ac6.27m],\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable.

Speculation has suggested they may do likewise from European golf as a whole, should Germany not be awarded the 2022 Ryder Cup. Pelley shrugged off the notion that Wentworth itself, where the European Tour has its headquarters, could now seen as problematic with regards the elitist perception of golf. Reports have suggested the club\u2019s new owners could seek \u00a3100,000 for membership. \u201cI think that the businessmen have the right,\u201d added the chief executive. \u201cThey have purchased that. They can decide what they want to do and how they want to run the business. \u201cFor us, the priority is the west course. There are a lot of exclusive golf courses that are playing major events and our priority would be the west course and that tournament building over time into, as you\u2019ve said, a flagship event. But you won\u2019t hear me say it\u2019s our flagship event right now.\u201d Pelley also confirmed new membership criteria for European Tour players.

He\u2019s been an unbelievable ambassador for the European Tour. He has done everything we have asked him to do. \u201cSo he\u2019s a world-class player with many different scheduling opportunities. This was one that unless he was in significant contention, he was going to miss. It wasn\u2019t a surprise.

Scant consolation though it is but Murray has not played a lot worse this year and Nadal has not played a lot better since his mid-summer slump in winning 6-4, 6-1 in a little over an hour and a half on Wednesday. Still, as Murray said looking back on the wreckage, he at least knew there is the chance of a reprieve, having beaten David Ferrer handily in his first match. If he beats Wawrinka, who looked much improved on Wednesday night when beating David Ferrer 7-5, 6-2, he stays at No2 in the world all the way to the Australian Open final and that is a help in steering clear of Djokovic until the very end in Melbourne. However, when it was put to him in less than diplomatic terms that his defeat might have been an unexpected bonus if he ends up avoiding the world No1 on Saturday, Murray bridled. When it was suggested it might be easier to play Roger Federer than Djokovic in the semi-finals, he interrupted his inquisitor to point out neither opponentwas exactly a pushover. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a question, that\u2019s your opinion,\u201d he said, uncharacteristically ruffled. \u201cYou\u2019re basically telling me that the format is wrong. I think that Roger plays great in this event. He\u2019s won it, what, six times, played some unbelievable matches here. He obviously played great tennis yesterday [when he beat Djokovic]. \u201cThis isn\u2019t for me about who\u2019s better out of Roger and Novak because things can change on a daily basis. Obviously I lost comfortably to Rafa today and I could play him in a couple days\u2019 time and it could be a different story. \u201cI\u2019m sure Novak feels the same way about his match with Roger. I think all of the players know that. \u201c I\u2019m not trying to finish second in the group. I\u2019m trying to win every match I play. I hope that\u2019s how all of the players view it. Some people might have different opinions. That\u2019s fine if you have a different opinion to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to tell me that the format is wrong, that I would rather finish second than first, when that\u2019s not true in my mind.\u201d Nor did he think the round-robin format was flawed, even though there have been only three three-set matches in the past 18 singles in the tournament. \u201cThe way the format is, almost every game is important, rather than thinking like: \u2018Oh, well, I can just lose this set, it\u2019s fine.\u2019 Maybe in the last round if you need to win one set to qualify, it\u2019s a bit different. \u201cBut every year when I\u2019ve played matches, pretty much where I needed one set to get through [he has done so]. I played Tsonga and won that match in two sets. I played Roger in Shanghai a few years ago, when I already qualified, and played near a three-hour match with him. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked at any of the matches like that. You certainly don\u2019t want to lose to one of the guys that you\u2019re competing against in the biggest events for the biggest titles in the sport quickly in the second set. I\u2019m obviously disappointed with the way the match finished today.\u201d As he might be, as his balance, poise and timing deteriorated after a sound start to the point where Nadal was bossing him around the court almost at will. Murray was desperately disappointed with his serve, too, hitting four double faults and a season-low figure of 37% on first serves in the first set, repairing the damage in the second to a still ordinary 43%. Murray said: \u201cHe was hitting the ball extremely well from the back of the court. From the middle until the end of the second set he played extremely well. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really help myself. I served poorly at the end of the first set and all through the second. That\u2019s not going to be good enough against him when he\u2019s playing that well.\u201d They traded early breaks and there was little in it until four-all in the first, after which Murray\u2019s focus seemed to disintegrate and his shot-making suffered as he struggled to hit deep or hard enough to worry Nadal. The second set was embarrassingly one-sided after the Spaniard held and broke at the start, then resolutely took control all the way to the end. For the world No5, who plays his compatriot David Ferrer on Friday, his season is glowing again after a determined effort to rebuild his confidence. \u201cI believe the last four tournaments, the positive results, the good feelings on court in terms of enjoying myself, in terms of image, is much better,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cBut this is just the beginning. I have to keep working hard. \u201cSport in general is quite simple. When I don\u2019t think about how to hit the ball, but when I think just about where to hit the ball, that\u2019s good news when all these things happens. \u201cToday I feel free. I feel I\u2019m enjoying it on court. That doesn\u2019t mean I am going to play well every match. That means I am happy. I go day by day.\u201d As days go, this was not a bad one for the beaming Mallorcan.

The gene, called mcr-1, allows a range of common bacteria, including E coli, to become resistant to the last fully functional class of antibiotics, the polymyxins. This gene, they say, is widespread in bugs called Enterobacteriaceae carried by both pigs and people in south China and is likely to spread worldwide. The gene is easily transferred from one strain of bacteria to another. Enterobacteriaceae are capable of causing a range of diseases, from pneumonia to serious blood infections. Some of the strains of Enterobacteriaceae with the gene have epidemic potential, say experts in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal. \u201cThese are extremely worrying results,\u201d said Prof Jian-Hua Liu from South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, author of the report. \u201cOur results reveal the emergence of the first polymyxin resistance gene that is readily passed between common bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting that the progression from extensive drug resistance to pandrug resistance is inevitable.\u201d   Related: Antibiotic-resistant bugs need global response, say health experts    The polymyxins are an older class of antibiotic, discovered more than 60 years ago but relatively little used because of their toxicity. The spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria led to renewed interest in them. Polymyxins B and E (known as colistin) are now the last resort for infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria such as E coli. Experts came across the gene that confers resistance to them by chance during routine testing of animals destined for the food market. Liu and colleagues isolated an E coli strain (SHP45) from a pig on an intensive pig farm in Shanghai that showed resistance to colistin that could be transferred to another strain. The discovery led them to carry out more widespread testing. They collected bacteria samples from pigs at slaughter across four provinces, and from pork and chicken sold in 30 open markets and 27 supermarkets across Guangzhou between 2011 and 2014. They also analysed bacteria samples from patients with infections who were admitted to two hospitals in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. They found the gene in 166 out of 804 animals tested and in 78 of 523 raw meat samples. They also found it in 16 E coli and K pneumoniae samples taken from 1,322 patients. The scientists believe the resistance to colistin began in animals. China is one of the world\u2019s largest users and producers of colistin for agriculture and veterinary use. Worldwide, the demand for colistin in agriculture is expected to reach almost 12,000 tonnes a year by the end of 2015, rising to 16,500 tonnes by 2021. \u201cThe emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics,\u201d say the authors. China\u2019s agriculture ministry has already responded to the report by launching a risk assessment on the use of colistin in animal feed additives. But they warn that the gene is likely to spread worldwide. \u201cThere are many countries, including in Europe, that use polymixins in agriculture, and therefore the responsibility to acknowledge and address the use of antibiotics across human and veterinary sectors must be also global,\u201d they write. David Paterson and Patrick Harris from the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, writing a commentary in the journal, say the use of colistin in agriculture must be limited or stopped altogether. \u201cThis will require substantial political will and we call upon Chinese leaders to act rapidly and decisively. Failure to do so will create a public health problem of major dimensions,\u201d they write. Prof Nigel Brown, president of the Microbiology Society, said the discovery that resistance to colistin could be transferred from one bacteria to another was alarming. \u201cAlthough resistance to this important and widely used polymyxin group of antibiotics has previously been shown, it was generally caused by mutation in individual organisms,\u201d he said.  \u201cNow that it has been demonstrated that resistance can be transferred between bacteria and across bacterial species, another line of defence against infection is in danger of being breached. We need careful surveillance to track the potential global spread of this resistance, and investment in research to discover new drugs with different modes of action.\u201d", "tags": ["Infectious diseases", "Antibiotics", "China", "Medical research", "Microbiology", "Science", "Society", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2015-11-18T23:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/19/victoria-to-review-whether-or-not-state-will-continue-to-fund-coal-projects", "sentences": ["The project to make brown coal briquettes for export to China was withdrawn less than 12 months after Shanghai Electric Australia Power and Energy Development Pty Ltd was awarded state and federal government funding."], "title": "Victoria to review whether or not state will continue to fund coal projects", "article": "The Victorian government has announced an independent review of coal development projects after a demonstration plant in the Latrobe Valley which was set to receive federal and state funding failed to attract private investment.

The treasurer said the acquisition of S Kidman and Co Limited, which holds about 1.3% of Australia\u2019s total land area and 2.5% of its agricultural land, would be against the national interest and he would not authorise the sale to proceed as proposed.   Related: Beef, big bucks and buy-ups: are Chinese investors changing the face of Australia?    The decision \u2013 which followed advice from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) \u2013 could pave the way for some of the company\u2019s holdings to be offered for sale in a different form. Kidman described the decision as a surprise and began reviewing its options for a revised sale. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, played down the potential for a backlash from Beijing given the high level of interest in the sale from Chinese bidders. The government said Kidman\u2019s 10 cattle stations included properties across regional South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland covering 101,411 sq km and managing a long-term average herd of 185,000 cattle. Morrison said about half of the Anna Creek pastoral lease was in South Australia\u2019s Woomera prohibited area (WPA), a military weapons testing range. It was \u201cnot unusual for governments to restrict access to sensitive areas on national security grounds\u201d. \u201cGiven the size and significance of the total portfolio of Kidman properties along with the national security issues around access to the WPA, I have determined, after taking advice from FIRB, that it would be contrary to Australia\u2019s national interest for a foreign person to acquire S Kidman and Co in its current form,\u201d he said. \u201cI note that following communication of my decision all bidders to acquire S Kidman and Co Limited have elected to withdraw their FIRB applications prior to my final order being formalised.\u201d The bidding process has reportedly been dominated by Chinese companies. Shanghai Pengxin was said to have offered about $350m, but was facing competition from other bidders including the Hong-Kong based investment firm Genius Link Asset Management. Before Morrison\u2019s decision was announced, Genius Link Group\u2019s founder, Joel Chang, told the Australian Financial Review there was \u201c$1bn that we want to deploy in Australia over the next three years\u201d. Morrison said it was a matter for the seller \u201cto consider how they wish to proceed with offering the composite interests of S Kidman and Co Limited for sale\u201d and he would consider any future proposals on their merits.   Related: Barnaby Joyce exposes split in Coalition with desire for foreign ownership ban    The Kidman managing director, Greg Campbell, said the the company would now talk to the government and assess its options. \u201cWe did think on balance these applications would pass scrutiny,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe were at the fairly final stages of negotiations with a very short list [of bidders] who were at the higher price end of things and a big hold-up in proceeding through finalising sale was achieving these approvals. It was a surprise this morning but it\u2019s just another roadblock we\u2019ll have to work through.\u201d Campbell confirmed all of the final bidders were offshore entities because the Australian domestic buyers \u201cfell away in price\u201d in the later stages of the process. Some of the offshore parties had been talking to Australian entities about potential joint investment, and those discussions might now have to be brought forward, the managing director said. Turnbull indicated he was not anticipating a backlash from the Chinese government. \u201cYou would be wrong to assume that there was only one foreign country associated with buyers, so there\u2019s no issue of discrimination here, but plainly the Woomera prohibited area is called the prohibited area for a reason,\u201d the prime minister told reporters on the sidelines of the Apec conference in Manila. \u201cI think what Scott has said in his statement, which I\u2019m sure the owners will read carefully, is that there\u2019s nothing to stop them to recalibrate or restructure the way in which they\u2019re selling these assets and resubmit, so no doubt they will reflect on that.\u201d The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said while he held concerns about the proposed sale, the government should be careful about the message it sent to foreign investors. \u201cPersonally I had my concerns, it\u2019s a big issue, but that\u2019s why we have a Foreign Investment Review Board process,\u201d Shorten said. The federal Coalition government has repeatedly declared that Australian is \u201copen for business\u201d but foreign ownership of agricultural land is particularly contentious within the Nationals.

The second series of the Chinese version of the BBC\u2019s Top Gear, with a Taiwanese actor-singer, a TV host and a former top executive at an internet firm taking the place of the, now former, British hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, launched on pay-TV cable and satellite service Shanghai Dragon TV on 19 October. The series, which airs across China and Taiwan, has so far attracted an average TV audience to date of 9 million viewers tuning into the first scheduled broadcast of each episode. The fifth and most recent episode \u2013 in which the presenters race across the UK in vehicles not available in China in a battle for a single ticket to Manchester United v Everton \u2013 attracted a series high 11 million viewers. The TV viewing has been amplified by a huge online audience of 173 million across the series so far, aggregating figures from China\u2019s eight biggest video platforms including Tencent, Youku, Tudou, Sohu, Iqiyi and Baofeng. Paul Dempsey, president of global markets at BBC Worldwide, used the success in China to highlight the strength of the Top Gear franchise.  Some observers question whether the loss of Clarkson, Hammond and May may damage the popularity and sales potential of the overall brand which makes about \u00a350m in revenues annually. \u201cThe success of Top Gear in China once again demonstrates the unique appeal of the world\u2019s favourite motoring entertainment show,\u201d said Dempsey. \u201cIt\u2019s also testament to a successful collaboration between our own UK producers and their Chinese counterparts who have recreated a British institution for a whole new audience.\u201d The collaboration was perhaps not so successful for series one, which averaged about half the TV viewing and drew only 33 million online viewers in total, with all three hosts changed and elements of the format of the show overhauled for the second series.

A detailed map of all seven continents looms by the chair in my home office. It\u2019s a relatively new purchase; one I made as soon as I realized that my YA alternate history novel Wolf By Wolf featured a cross-continental motorcycle race from Germania (once Berlin) to Tokyo.

Many hours have been spent staring at its laminated expanse, trying to figure out the perils my characters will have to deal with next chapter. Saharan sandstorm? Check.

Not only is this a useful tool for plotting world domination (the fictional kind, of course), but it\u2019s also a constant reminder to get out there and explore. Because, sometimes, the world is my desk.     Ryan Graudin, nomadic writer.    As I\u2019ve discussed before; travelling is essential to my creative process. Stories aren\u2019t pieced together in a vacuum. Discovering different landscapes, eating new foods and meeting people from all walks of life fill my creative well. These experiences provide inspiration I never could\u2019ve hoped to find sitting at home, staring at a screen cursor.  But the thing I love about laptops? You can take them anywhere! On a plane, in a train, to the beach - I\u2019ll stop before this gets too Seussian, but you get the idea. My husband and I are both fortunate enough to be full time artists, so neither of us are bound by the fourteen vacation days a year that so many of our peers are beholden to. No physical office can contain us! Unfortunately, deadlines are also without borders. Most of my trips are accompanied by a healthy dose of work. I still end up staring at a cursor, but at least the world around my screen is the non-laminated version. Does this really help your creative process, Ryan? I hear you asking. Why, yes, dear reader! Here\u2019s proof:     Ryan Graudin at work on her novel in China.    I took a trip to Yangshuo, China in early 2014. I was working on my rough draft of Wolf By Wolf at the time, stealing away to our hotel\u2019s veranda to work within phenomenal views of the karst landscape. I was about two-thirds of the way through the book, and I hadn\u2019t quite figured out what elements of the Axis Tour\u2019s racing path to feature in the narrative as the motorcycle racers drove from Hanoi to Shanghai. After exploring the countryside around Yangshuo, I became enamoured with its dramatic mountains, roadside tombs and winding green river filled with cormorants and bamboo rafts. Was it possible I could work these elements into Wolf By Wolf? Once I returned to my home office and consulted my map, I realised that Yangshuo was perfectly situated to be featured in the Axis Tour. Thus, Chapter 28, (which features a harrowing ferry crossing over the Li River on bamboo rafts) sprang into existence.     Ryan Graudin\u2019s home office, with added wolf dog.        In the end, of course, there\u2019s no place like home. I return to my office, where a wolf-dog lies at my feet and the true bulk of writing gets done.

Fortunately no rewrites nor handle changes will be necessary. He and his team held their nerve and saw out a nail-biting and gripping finale of the FIA World Endurance Championship in Bahrain, to ensure that this time he would be coming home with the title. A deserved reward for a fine driver and for his Porsche team who also won their first top-end sportscar drivers\u2019 championship since 1986. The Australian missed out in 2010 at the final round in Abu Dhabi while driving for Red Bull, the year Sebastian Vettel took his first F1 championship. It was the closest Webber came to that title, but having switched to drive for Porsche in the WEC in 2014, securing the drivers\u2019 championship with team-mates Brendon Hartley and Timo Bernhard looked like being an altogether easier task in Bahrain.   Related: Mark Webber\u2019s journey beyond F1 takes him to brink of first world title    Having taken pole position their No17 Porsche required only a fourth place or better finish to take the title in a car that had been dominant over nearest rivals, the No7 Audi of Marcel F\u00e4ssler, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer. But this was to be no cruise and there was drama almost from the off when Bernhard suffered a throttle actuator problem on his first stint and lost five laps to leaders, dropping to 19th place. The Porsche had been almost bulletproof on reliability all season but suddenly what had been expected to be a fairly straightforward job had become a real battle to fightback for the title. It was a potentially game-changing moment in the championship as the Audi crew sniffed a chance. They powered to the front, aiming for the win that was their best bet of taking the title at the last. Behind them, coming through the slower cars of the other classes and making the most of the 919 Hybrid\u2019s straightline speed, the No17 had recovered to sixth at the end of the second hour but was still three laps down from the fourth-placed Toyota of No1 car Anthony Davidson, S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima. At which point making it to that crucial fourth place looked too large a task when the pendulum swung again. The No8 Audi of Oliver Jarvis Lo\u00efc Duval and Lucas di Grassi, then in third, took an unscheduled pitstop on lap 91, two hours and 45 minutes into the race, losing eight laps thanks to a driveshaft problem that advanced the No17 to fifth place \u2013 enough for the title could their sister car, the No18 of Neel Jani, Romain Dumas and Marc Lieb, take the win and demote the No7 to second. Which they set about with determination. Just past the three-hour mark Lieb was dicing with Tr\u00e9luyer for the lead with the pair swapping the front spot across several laps. Lieb kept putting his nose ahead and although Tr\u00e9luyer was in no mood to make it easy he had the lead by lap 112. The No18 crew wanted to take the flag but it was also the second time this season they have proved what a team sport this is. Out of the running for the title they had led up until the last minutes of the race at round six in Fuji before allowing the No17 car to inherit the win. With the points at the death proving so tight it was, alongside their victory here, crucial in sealing the championship for their sister car. They had extended the lead further after a wheel nut issue forced the No7 car to pit later in the race, yet even with some semblance of calm returning, Webber himself had to go through the grinder one final time. Taking the car for the final stints to the finish, the actuator problem recurred alongside what appeared to be a front-wheel hybrid harvesting issue. The car had to pit again and was intermittently losing power on track and no doubt pushing Webber\u2019s nerves to the edge. Fortunately he and his car gritted it out. The No18 took the flag after 199 laps, ahead of the No7 by a minute and a half, while the No17 took fifth and the title to the relief of the entire team, just five points clear of the Audi crew. \u201cThat shows the fighting quality of the team,\u201d said Webber. \u201cWe had a lot of problems and it was very stressful; we got the car home and we had enough points and enough wins to be world champions.\u201d Indeed it was a deserved championship. Audi had opened the season strongly with wins at Silverstone and Spa but since the season\u2019s blue riband event, won by the No19 Porsche of Britain\u2019s Nick Tandy, Germany\u2019s Nico H\u00fclkenberg and New Zealand\u2019s Earl Bamber, the team\u2019s third car entered for Le Mans only, Porsche have enjoyed a considerable advantage in pace. Webber and his team-mates went on to win at the next round at the N\u00fcrburgring, then also at the Circuit of the Americas, that third win at Fuji followed which was enough for them to take the lead in the title standings and at the last round in Shanghai a fourth successive victory put them within touching distance of the drivers\u2019 title and ensured Porsche took the manufacturers\u2019 championship, the double then this season, having only returned to top-end prototype racing in 2014 after a 16-year absence. The trio were also second at this year\u2019s Le Mans 24 Hours but none of the three drivers has won a world championship title before. Hartley, who is 26 years old, was a reserve driver for Red Bull in 2009 and 2010 (alongside Daniel Ricciardo) and tested for the team when Webber broke his leg in a cycling accident in 2008. His previous highest series win was the Eurocup Formula Renault in 2007. Bernhard is no stranger to winning however and already has an exemplary record in endurance racing. He won Le Mans in 2010 with Audi and is the most recent driver to have claimed the sport\u2019s triple crown, with wins at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2003 and the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2008 alongside his victory at La Sarthe, but this is also his first world championship title. Yet it will perhaps be of most import to the Australian, the F1 title, Webber admits, was the one he wanted most but having to had to fight so hard to take this one will doubtless make it all the sweeter. Alex Wurz, who was competing in his final race having announced he was retiring at the end of the season, took third place in the No2 Toyota, alongside his team-mates St\u00e9phane Sarrazin and Mike Conway. In LMP2, Sam Bird, Julien Canal and Roman Rusinov took the drivers\u2019 championship for G-Drive; in GTE PRO Richard Lietz and Michael Christensen claimed the title for Manthey Porsche and in GTE AM the SMP Ferrari of Andrea Bertolini, Viktor Shaitar and Aleksey Basov were champions.", "tags": ["Mark Webber", "World Endurance Championship", "Le Mans 24 Hours", "Australia sport", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2015-11-21T20:05:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/22/paris-attacks-should-see-big-picture", "sentences": ["But today the news from the Caliphate or Eritrea or the stock markets of Shanghai may be far more important than anything happening on the street where you live."], "title": "We should see the big picture.

Why such overwhelming media attention to the horror of Paris, page after page filled with eyewitnesses and reconstructions day after day, TV anchors from around the globe broadcasting live from the shadow of the Eiffel Tower? Roberts was back in London for a while after a stint working for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Yemen, helping treat thousands upon thousands of casualties from the Saudi air war against the Houthi insurgency. \u201cIt\u2019s the first place I\u2019ve been to where I haven\u2019t met a journalist at all. This is a conflict that\u2019s just not in the public eye.\u201d And when she asked, at a One World Media meeting, why that was so, she mentioned how interest in the Yemen war rated on her Facebook page \u2013 and the number of \u201clikes\u201d alongside every piece. Few likes, few readers: so few incentives for editors to cover this particular carnage overmuch, if at all. The curse of the emojis, even before Facebook\u2019s algorithms have started filtering the news it brings to you rather than telling it straight and true. We talk of social media \u2013 instant, transparent, decisive \u2013 as though they delivered one open world. We can choose what we like, and those messages automatically influence the people who provide the choices. But how do we know what we\u2019re missing? The ancestral mantra of the trade is simple: all news is local. But today the news from the Caliphate or Eritrea or the stock markets of Shanghai may be far more important than anything happening on the street where you live. Emma Kelly was working at the Daily Star Online on the Friday night that Isis struck \u2013 and counted the hits. \u201cA story about a town being blown to pieces in, let\u2019s say, Lebanon may get a couple of thousand hits,\u201d she blogged. \u201cThe Paris attacks got thousands of hits every minute \u2026 Don\u2019t complain that the media didn\u2019t tell you about a tragedy on the other side of the world. They did. You just didn\u2019t click.\u201d Yet why, by the muddled standards of people like us in little local-land, was coverage of Paris so intensive? It easy to set the deaths and maimings of French tragedy beside other recent terrorist outrages and rationalise the differences. Nigeria last week: more than 40 dead. Beirut a few days ago: 44 dead. Baghdad in August: 67 dead. Garissa University, Kenya, in April: 147 dead. These aren\u2019t \u201cpeople like us\u201d in situations we can relate to. Yet then the lines of logic start to knot. We can relate to young girls from England fleeing to Isis-held Syria via Turkey apparently, but not to 99 Turkish peace marchers dying in October\u2019s Ankara bomb blast. We can surely relate to 224 passengers on a jet blown to smithereens over Sinai (except that they\u2019re Russians and the plight of innocent Brits stranded scuba-diving in Sharm for a couple more days takes pride of place). We can relate to the French bodies lying in concert halls and under restaurant tables more than we can (seemingly) relate to 30 holidaymaking Brits murdered by a jihadi gunman on a Tunisian beach in June or the 22 western tourists massacred in Tunis\u2019s national museum a few weeks before that. OK. It was a plot, or a series of interlocking plots \u2013 not a lone killer wandering around the sands of Sousse shooting tourists. It was happening a couple of Eurostar hours from St\u00a0Pancras. The young people who died at a heavy metal concert had smiles and energy we could recognise \u2013 and feel angry emotion over lives cut short. The stories of bravery and loss are heart-breaking. This was, and is, a portent of possible things to come. There were, and are, political issues sprouting from this bloodstained ground: the supposed perils of the refugee influx, the supposed incapacity of political leaders to respond. There are, and will be, French TV thrillers that pick up the threads, chases, gunfights, bodies. Yet still the whole picture isn\u2019t in focus; still any hint of proportionality fades swiftly from view. The hits accumulate, the news anchors head for the airport. And there\u2019s a grisly warning here: if, indeed, the point of terrorism is to terrorise, to bring fear and divisions and irrationality in its wake, then killing sprees in Paris or London or New York \u2013 big media, excellent communications \u2013 are a much better idea than stirring up trouble in the Yemen (no journalists in sight). If the point is producing a dismal response from frightened politicians and voters, then the spectacle of one US state after another posting signs saying \u201cNo Syrian refugees here\u201d (a sentiment 55% echoed in the UK by a ComRes poll for the Mail) is meat and drink at a jihadi banquet. \u201cEurope\u2019s freedom of movement is in question,\u201d writes the FT. \u201cSo too are American values. That is what the terrorists want. To defeat them, we must remember who we are.\u201d But can we remember that, in a melee in which terror \u201cmasterminds\u201d are created in a trice and obliterated just as fast? How do we get a grip on reality when one huge story sweeps the big picture away? People like us can\u2019t find refuge on the streets where we live. There is no safe haven behind locked front doors. And there is no news imperative to pretend that such safety exists. All media \u2013 including social media \u2013 exist to make us better informed, to arm us with facts.

We\u2019ve announced a \u00a31bn investment programme and we\u2019re well equipped to play a bigger and broader role \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing that with the level of long-haul growth.\u201d O\u2019Toole said Manchester was \u201cagnostic\u201d on the question of whether Heathrow or Gatwick should be expanded, with both London airports claiming to be at or near capacity in terms of the number of flights they can handle. Notably, the number of planes has fallen at Manchester since its own controversial second runway was built, leaving it at a fraction of its potential 55 million-passenger annual capacity. Work will start next year on a \u00a31bn overhaul of the airport\u2019s terminals and infrastructure. Manchester counts a catchment of about 22 million people within two hours\u2019 drive, and has been pushing for improved rail and road links to increase that number, including high-speed rail. O\u2019Toole added: \u201cHaving HS2 [the high-speed rail link] at Manchester airport will shrink the size of the UK for passengers, meaning more people can get to an airport quicker, and the more attractive that airport is for direct services.\u201d New direct flights to Beijing will start next June, and Air China has made an application to fly direct from Shanghai, though an airport spokesman said that was \u201cthe start of a long process\u201d. While the government has talked up investment in Manchester as part of its \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d plans, O\u2019Toole commented: \u201cUltimately, all the support in the world makes no differences unless the commercial argument stacks for airlines. With the diversity of that catchment, we\u2019ve been successful in securing the Beijing route and others.\u201d Dubai, served by Emirates, remains Manchester\u2019s most popular international route. Manchester\u2019s 23 millionth passenger was due to fly with easyJet to Geneva on Monday morning.

By 2025, the UN predicts, that number will exceed 12 million. Congo\u2019s capital Kinshasa will have gone from 200,000 to more than 16 million, growing over the next decade at the vertiginous rate of 4% a year (about 40 people an hour). Meanwhile Brazil\u2019s economic engine S\u00e3o Paulo will have slowed to less than 1% per annum, nonetheless experiencing a 10-fold expansion over the 75-year period. Earlier this year London overtook its historical high of 8.6 million reached at the outset of the second world war, bucking the trend of many European and North American cities which have experienced only slight or even negative growth. Compared to other global cities, London is inching forward, with only nine new residents an hour, compared to double that number in S\u00e3o Paulo and over 70 in Delhi, Lagos and Dhaka. Nonetheless, London will accommodate one million more people by 2030. These snapshots reflect deep differences in patterns of urban growth and change across the globe, often masked by the crude statistic that the world is now more urban than rural, and that we are heading towards the 70% threshold by 2050. To better understand the impacts of these regional differences, the Urban Age has investigated the demographic, economic and environmental patterns linked to global urbanisation and urban change. Demographic change Historically, urbanisation has always been closely linked to economic development. While growth in the mature cities of Europe and North America accelerated in the 19th century, most reached their peak by mid-20th century. Other regions of the world saw their cities grow most significantly since the 1950s. Tokyo grew by more than half a million inhabitants each year between 1950 and 1990, Mexico City and S\u00e3o Paulo by more than 300,000, and Mumbai by around 240,000.  The only exceptions in this period were cities in China and Sub-Saharan Africa, which experienced only modest growth. But from the 1990s onwards \u2013 with the impact of globalisation and opening up of the Chinese economy \u2013 cities continued to grow rapidly in south and south-east Asia, with China experiencing a sustained growth spurt that is palpable today. For example, the South Guangdong metropolitan area (which includes Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Dongguan) saw its 5.5 million inhabitants in 1990 increase six-fold to reach almost 32 million in just two decades.  The result of this process of growth and change is an uneven distribution of urbanisation across the globe. Europe, South and North America are the most urbanised of the five continents \u2013 with 73%, 83% and 82% of people respectively living in cities, towns and other urban settlements. Africa stands at around 40% and Asia at 48% \u2013 and both regions are set to experience exponential growth in the coming decades, a combined effect of increased birth rate and migration.      Past and present growth of large cities. Source: World Urbanisation Prospects/LSE Cities    The stark differences in patterns of urban growth across the globe are graphically illustrated in the map above. It charts the population size of a selection of world cities with more than a million people from 1950 to 2025. By highlighting three periods of past and future growth (based on UN predictions), the uneven distribution of urbanisation becomes clear to see. Most large cities of Europe and parts of North America hit their current size by 1950. Latin America, the west coast of the USA, Japan and some Asian cities grew substantially in the years leading to 1990. But the bulk of urban growth will be experienced in Sub-Saharan Africa, India and China and other Asian cities like Dhaka and Manila, while Tokyo will experience relatively modest growth over the same period.  The same data has been translated by the Urban Age to capture how these numbers impact cities on the ground. The map at the top of the page shows how many people are likely to be added to some of the world\u2019s largest cities through a combination of natural internal growth and migration. Again, the projected growth rates of African and Indian cities stand out. Of the Urban Age cities, the regional pattern is reinforced, with Delhi growing at 79 people/hour, Shanghai at 53 and Mumbai at 51; Latin American cities like Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro slowing to 22, 18 and 10 respectively while New York and London demonstrate their urban resurgence at 9 and 10 people/hour, running contrary to the majority of mature cities in Europe (especially Eastern Europe) and some cities in North America which have been hit particularly hard by economic restructuring and the recent recession. Interestingly, Hong Kong\u2019s highly controlled and efficient planning regime leads to a relatively low projection of 4 people/hour.  Economic development Analysing patterns of economic development in cities across the globe reveals equally striking regional differences. Using data on the economic performance of 700 cities with more than 500,000 people over the next 15 years (based on data from UN Desa), it appears that larger cities tend to perform disproportionately well. In 2012, large cities made up 33% of the world\u2019s global population, but produced more than 55% of all global economic output.  Future patterns of economic output and growth for the same 700 cities show that dramatic regional differences will still persist in GDP per capita in 2030 between the global north and global south \u2013 with important exceptions in the Middle East, China and parts of Latin America and Oceania, with the most intense growth in average GDP concentrated in China and East Asia. While there is evidence that urbanisation contributes to wealth creation, especially in cities in developing countries, it is likely that the economic gulf between rich and poor is likely to persist.       The geography of energy consumption. Source: LandScan, IEA, World Energy Balances Database/LSE Cities    Environmental impact Where people live and how much they consume are inextricably linked. People living in the highly concentrated urbanised regions of eastern China and the Ganges Valley in India have modest consumption patterns compared to the oil and petrol-guzzling habits of those in the more sparsely populated regions of North America and the Middle East, where people have much higher income levels. There are equally varied patterns between the established urban areas of Europe and the US, and the more widely scattered but dense cities of Latin America and Africa. Reflecting global disparities in wealth, lifestyles and consumption, the map below confirms that a person living in the United Arab Emirates is likely to use 40 times more energy than a Bangladeshi, while a UK citizen consumes less than half of his US counterpart, but twice as much as a typical Mexican, and slightly less than a Dane. Electricity is a major component of the world\u2019s energy mix. Yet, electrification differs substantially between countries, swinging from less than 5% of total energy in Nigeria and Nepal, to more than 50% in Sweden and France. But a high share of electricity does not necessarily deliver environmental benefits. Generation is still dominated by carbon emitting fossil fuels, and electricity is not always the most efficient energy choice for uses such as heating and cooling in buildings. Aside from electricity, most of the world\u2019s energy consumption involves directly burning fossil fuels, such as oil for transport, coal for making steel and cement industries and gas for heating. Despite recent improvements in some countries in procuring energy from renewables, they make up only 13% of the world\u2019s total consumption \u2013 mostly hydro-electricity in high-income countries and biomass for cooking and heating in low income countries. Carbon emissions by sector confirm that fossil-fuel based electricity is an important contributor to global climate change. Emissions from electricity generation vary depending on fuel source, with coal-dependent countries such as Australia, China and South Africa showing high proportions. In contrast, Denmark has lower emissions from electricity due to its high level of renewable generation. Varying levels of emissions from transport also echo motorisation rates. Global carbon emissions are concentrated in a few nations with China and the US alone producing 39% of global emissions.      Urban v rural populations. Photograph: LSE Cities    The urban footprint To capture the subtle variations in patterns of urban and rural habitats, the Urban Age has mapped the urban footprint of Europe, Africa, China and India. In Europe, there is a more decentralised form of urbanisation that reflects the culture, history and geography of the region \u2013 and the fact that Europe urbanised early at a time when transport costs were significantly higher.  Even though 73% of Europeans live in urban areas \u2013 the most urbanised of the four global regions \u2013 the urbanisation density threshold is low, meaning that areas with more than 314 people/sq km are considered urban, contrasting with India where this threshold is over 10 times higher. Europe\u2019s urban residents occupy just 3% of the total land area of the geographic region, and a third of the total land area remains unpopulated, consisting mostly of large bodies of water and mountains. In addition to 128 cities with over 500,000 people, there are a large number of highly connected smaller cities and towns across parts of Germany, the Netherlands and Benelux countries, and Northern Italy. This highly connected urban area represents one of the wealthiest parts of the globe.  India stands out for the far higher population densities in rural areas across vast territories such as the Ganga valley, as well as the emerging presence of large cities like Calcutta, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. The dark grey areas in Northern India reflect the preponderance of high-density rural areas which, by European standards, would be considered urban. While India has an urbanisation level of 32%, its urban areas represent only 1% of the total land surface of the country, but only 5% of the country is unpopulated \u2013 a much lower percentage the other three global regions. In India, the urbanisation density threshold is by far the highest of the four regions, at 4,128 people/sq km.   Related: Climate change and cities: a prime source of problems, yet key to a solution    Sub-Saharan Africa is by far the largest of the four regions and is experiencing a period of intense demographic growth. While only 37% of the population lives in urban areas today, that percentage is set to rise dramatically, much of it through informal growth. While urbanisation levels are below that of the other global regions, just 0.4% of the total land area in this part of the continent is urban, while around a third of the total land area (32%) remains unpopulated. There are fewer, higher density rural areas than in China or Asia, with concentrations around Lagos, Kigali, Nairobi and Addis Ababa. The urbanisation density threshold is 1,019 people/sq km. Just over half China\u2019s population (54%) live in urban areas, which represent just 2% of the total geographic footprint of the nation, with largely unpopulated regions making up 39% of the total land surface area. With its rapid demographic and economic growth, urbanisation levels are approximately two-thirds that of Europe. As in India, there are extensive concentrations of higher density rural areas in the regions stretching from Beijing to Shanghai, and around the Chongqing, Chengdu and Nanchong districts, all areas which are experiencing a rapid transformation from agricultural to urban economies. China has an urbanisation density threshold of 1,433 people/sq km.

Related: Rory McIlroy wins DP World Tour Championship and Race to Dubai    The Northern Irishman\u2019s plans for 2016 can wait; he is of a mind to think through the professional year which concluded on Sunday with success at the DP World Tour Championship. Given all that had come before, there seemed an extra significance to this McIlroy victory, which brought him his third Race to Dubai championship in four years. Don\u2019t dare mention to McIlroy, though, that his sign-off win was a shot across the bows of Spieth, or the world No2, Jason Day. \u201cI\u2019m not sending a message to anyone,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI\u2019m just going out there to play my best. I had goals and objectives which had nothing to do with Jordan Spieth or Jason Day. \u201cI wanted to win the Race to Dubai, I wanted to beat Danny Willett over the week and I wanted to beat Andy Sullivan. Whether it\u2019s Jordan Spieth or Jason Day or anyone else, I have certain objectives throughout the year and it doesn\u2019t matter who it is, I just want to play the best golf possible. I know if I do play to my best or close to my best then I am able to win big tournaments.\u201d McIlroy has firmed his stance regarding the ankle injury he sustained in July and which so disrupted his year, most notably when he missed the Open. Football matches with his friends will continue; but the timing will be different. \u201cYou definitely can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d McIlroy added. \u201cI had a big lead in the world rankings and you see Jordan and Jason play the way they did. Fields are so deep, you can\u2019t let up at all. \u201cThis is my time to capitalise on my career. The next 10, 15 years is my time. I really can\u2019t be doing silly things like playing football in the middle of the season to jeopardise even six months of my career. It\u2019s a big chunk where I could make some hay and win a major or two. I won\u2019t be making those mistakes again next year.\u201d The ankle injury aside, McIlroy lost almost a stone after a bout of food poisoning in Shanghai last month. The challenge of restoring his body to peak performance over the festive season is one the golfer is relishing. \u201cI want to try and get healthy and get stronger again, get my body back, because I haven\u2019t been able to do as much in the gym as I would have liked over the past few months,\u201d McIlroy explained. \u201cSo I am really going to concentrate on that. I\u2019ve got an eight-week period where I don\u2019t have to play golf \u2013 I don\u2019t have to worry about being sore, going and playing a round of golf. \u201cI put a new driver and a new ball in the bag a few weeks ago; I think Turkey was the first place. I\u2019m really happy with that. I don\u2019t really want to tinker much with my equipment going forward. I\u2019m really happy with what I have.\u201d He added: \u201cI might hit a few shots between now and the new year, but I won\u2019t get serious until after the new year when I come back here to Dubai early January and start to practise again before the season.\u201d And what of the boarding pass from this year\u2019s trip to Abu Dhabi? McIlroy uses it to jot down a list of yearly objectives. He remains coy on what precisely can, or cannot, be ticked off from 2015. \u201cI always put down a couple of goals that are not golf-related, just things in my life that I would like to do better, as a person,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple things I\u2019ve been able to tick off that list. \u201cBut on the golf side, I guess just one, which was winning the Race to Dubai. Obviously I wanted to win majors. I wanted to improve in certain areas of my game and didn\u2019t quite do that, but these things happen. You have to set yourself these lofty goals to try and get better.\u201d Fresh impetus is an equally valuable asset.

This is a place called Thanet Earth in Kent, a hi-tech indoor farm that grows millions of fruit and vegetables throughout the year. The show is Tomorrow\u2019s Food (BBC1). Everything at Thanet Earth is controlled: the temperature, the weather, the insects. There\u2019s no soil, no earth at Thanet Earth; tomatoes are grown in a dense wool made of volcanic rock. It holds water better, doesn\u2019t have any dangerous bacteria and gives the grower more control. Precise amounts of nutrients and water\u00a0are drip-fed to the plants along pipes, all controlled by computer. The\u00a0plants are tricked into producing more fruit, using sudden drops of temperature. It means four or five times the yield of a more traditional method of growing tomatoes.

Maybe he\u2019s not allowed to; it might upset the delicate ecosystem. Perhaps a nozzle would appear from the floor, and immediately direct a jet of Daracide at him.

Matthew Heineman\u2019s film about the Autodefensas army of ordinary folk who took on the brutal drug cartels in the state of Michoac\u00e1n in Mexico. Dr Jos\u00e9 Mireles, who leads them, is a dude \u2013 a charismatic leader, orator, lover and silver fox who could have stepped from the silver screen. But, as the Autodefensas grow in power and success, there are questions\u00a0about whether they\u2019re any better than the cartels they\u2019re fighting. There\u2019s a parallel story going on, north of the border in Arizona, where Tim \u201cNailer\u201d Foley leads the Arizona Border Recon.

How governance structures around the world compare", "article": "On Valentine\u2019s Day 2014, Delhi\u2019s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal resigned. Opposition politicians blocked his anti-corruption bill in the state assembly because, they argued, it was unconstitutional to introduce legislation that did not have the approval of the federal government. A full year of President\u2019s Rule ensued with the city\u2019s administration effectively paralysed, leaving the capital of the world\u2019s biggest democracy without local representation. Speaking at an Urban Age conference in Delhi during that year, Gerald Frug, professor of local government law at Harvard University, stated that \u201ccities ought to be able to make policies that improve the lives of their own citizens\u201d. But, he continued: \u201cThe more basic question for urban dwellers today is: who decides who decides? Who has the power to allocate decision-making authority?\u201d This question is as pertinent to the residents of Delhi as it is to the residents of Mexico City \u2013 which Guardian Cities visited earlier in the month. In fact, only 40% of the 22 million people who live there are represented by the mayor of Mexico City DF (Distrito Federal) with the balance falling under the jurisdiction of the State of Mexico, one of the 31 that make up the Mexican nation. It is not by chance, perhaps, that president of the country Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was, until recently, the governor of this populous state. Londoners, New Yorkers, Mumbaikers and Paulistanos are equally exercised by who runs their city. This concern reflects a general trend towards \u201curbanising\u201d government in developed and developing countries that are grappling with the need to re-think urban planning, investment and finance in the context of diminishing public funding and an increase in the role of the private sector. As the world becomes more urbanised, these governance questions become magnified in significance as cities become larger, more complex and more fragile.     Who decides who decides? Who has the power to allocate decision-making authority?  Gerald Frug     The geographic reach of a mayor\u2019s jurisdiction is only one parameter in the rich debate among academics and policymakers about urban empowerment and democracy. The role of central government, the state (as in US\u2019s Texas or India\u2019s Maharashtra), regions, municipalities, public-private partnerships, quangos, community groups and other stakeholders preoccupy urban commentators, as does the hotly debated subject of devolution v centralisation and associated fiscal autonomy.  In some parts of the urban world \u2013 especially in Western Europe and South America \u2013 a broader, local coalition of city governments, private and civil society actors are increasingly having their say in determining municipal futures. In others \u2013 most notably the US, India and China \u2013 the central and federal government or state authorities seem to have kept their grip on the governance of cities.      How cities are governed: city v metropolitan area populations. Photograph: LSE Cities    The Urban Age at LSE Cities has carried out new research which aims to shed some light on the current debate about the dynamics of urban governance. It has investigated the \u201cfit\u201d between the size of the administrative boundary controlled by city governments (usually led by a mayor, city manager or governor) and the extent of the \u201cwider functional metropolitan\u201d area of 35 cities and undertaken a detailed analysis of the governance arrangements of complex cities like London, Delhi, Bogota and Tokyo. Like patterns of urbanisation across the globe, governance arrangements between some of the world\u2019s largest and fastest growing cities diverge widely. Only a handful of city governments of the developed and developing world have control over their metropolitan area, reflecting different institutional arrangements and the protracted time-lag required to align urban growth \u201con the ground\u201d with political boundaries.  Of 35 cities studied, the governor of Lagos oversees the urban futures of 100% of the estimated 21.5 million people living within the functional urban region. The powerful mayor of Istanbul (where President Recep Erdogan of Turkey built his political base as mayor before entering the national stage) has a similar level of geographic oversight over its 14 million inhabitants, as does the chief executive of 7.2 million residents of Hong Kong. Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai (with over 50 million inhabitants between them) control around 80% of their functional metropolitan area.  At the other extreme, only 8% of Manila\u2019s estimated 22.5 million metropolitan dwellers live under the eye of the mayor of Manila, 19% of metropolitan Parisians are represented by recently elected mayor Anne Hidalgo (who stands for the 2.3 million residents living within the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique orbital motorway) and only 3.9 million Los Angelenos are represented by their mayor, a modest 23% of the 17.3 million people of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area.  While 8.6 million Londoners have been governed by a directly elected mayor since 2000, they still only represent 39% of the number of people who make up the more extensive economic region of the South-East of England, which contains 21.8 million people. Similarly, the governor of Tokyo is responsible for only 34% of what today is still one of the largest metropolitan agglomerations on the world with nearly 40 million inhabitants.    60% of the Greater London Authority budget is spent on transport, with nearly a third on police and security    To better understand the hierarchy of decision-making in London and other global cities, the Urban Age has created a series of diagrams that capture their governance structures, political representations and budgets. Unsurprisingly, no clear pattern emerges.  Following the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1985 and the implementation of the Greater London Authority Act in 1999, Londoners have been governed by a relatively innovative and \u201cslim\u201d administrative structure. The mayor sets the strategic framework for all of London\u2019s 33 boroughs (including the Corporation of London) and has executive powers over a number of city-wide areas including transport (the mayor chairs Transport for London), policing, fire and emergency services, inward investment and, to a degree, regeneration and housing. Other areas such as education and health are controlled by central or local government. Unlike other nations, there is no state or regional level of governance in the UK, as there is in Germany or the US. The London mayor has the largest electorate in the UK, and one of the largest in Europe, with 5.8 million voters entitled to take part in elections every four years. The 25 directly elected members of the London Assembly have the responsibility of scrutinising the Mayor\u2019s Office. Local boroughs, made up roughly 200,000-300,000 residents, are responsible for most other services including schools, social services planning, environment and waste collection. 28 of the 33 borough leaders are indirectly elected through the borough councils, with four borough-level mayors directly elected. The lion\u2019s share of the GLA budget is spent on transport (60%), with nearly one-third on police and security.     The political representation of Delhi. Photograph: LSE Cities    In contrast to London, Delhi\u2019s administration is dominated by central and state governments, leading to the tensions which caused municipal meltdown last year. The National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi is one of India\u2019s 29 states, with a population of 16.6 million. Its powers are closely dependent on the Indian national government. At the state level, powerful bodies such as the Delhi Development Authority and the Delhi Police are centrally supervised. Executive power is exerted through the chief minister of Delhi, who is elected by 70 members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly. The central government appoints the lieutenant governor. At the local level, there are 11 districts administered through four Municipal Corporations and, partly, by the Delhi Cantonment Board. The executives within these institutions are appointed by national ministries.  In 2012, a change in legislation saw the Delhi Municipal Corporation split into three separate corporations: the East, South and North Delhi Corporations, each with their own commissioner and mayor. 22% of the NCT\u2019s budget is allocated to public transport and 13% to urban development and housing, which still features significant levels of informal and sub-standard accommodation for the city\u2019s underclass. At the opposite end of the scale, in terms of development and efficiency, the Tokyo metropolitan region remains the largest urban agglomeration in the world with a population of 38 million people. Despite its size, it has developed an articulated metropolitan governance system that responds to its specific economic, environmental and social challenges, with one of the most sophisticated and efficient integrated public transport systems in the world.      How Tokyo is governed. Photograph: LSE Cities    Given the size and economic weight of the greater Tokyo area, the directly elected governor of Tokyo is the second most powerful figure in Japan after the prime minister, with an electorate of 9.6 million residents. 127 members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly are directly elected. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) administers a total of 62 municipalities which include 23 special wards, 26 cities, five towns and eight villages. Each of these 62 units has a directly elected mayor and assembly who serve office for four years. While the TMG handles broader administrative works, local municipalities are responsible for local services such as education, health and welfare. The 23 special high-density wards are home to major business activities, with different needs from the other municipalities in the prefecture. 16% of the TMG budget goes to education, 14% to transport and civil engineering, 14% to social welfare, and 15% is allocated to more local special ward initiatives.     The political representation of Bogot\u00e1. Photograph: LSE Cities    The limelight has recently returned to Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, whose voters re-elected Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa as mayor after a period of 14 years. The directly elected mayor of this city of over 7 million inhabitants is not allowed to hold office for more than one four-year term consecutively (by contrast, Michael Bloomberg succeeded in changing the law in New York City to be elected for a third consecutive term from 2009 to 2013).  While the city formally lies within the Department of Cundinamarca, it is administered independently from the rest of the state and has a degree of autonomy, with 45 directly elected councillors on the Bogot\u00e1 City Council. Like the UK and unlike India, the power of the regional state is not dominant in city governance structures. The mayor of Bogot\u00e1 has relatively strong powers across many different sectors including education, health and transport, while the 20 local administrative boards, each made up of between seven and 11 members, have relatively few responsibilities compared to local boroughs in other cities. Following Colombia\u2019s constitutional reform in 1991, the mayor\u2019s and city council\u2019s direct influence over transport, health, environmental and educational policies account for the city\u2019s ability to invest in infrastructure and transport initiatives, including the Transmilenio Bus Rapid Transit system, the ciclov\u00eda network of cycle ways, and the provision of high-quality schools and libraries near the city\u2019s most deprived communities. Some 26% of the city budget is allocated to education, with 17% on health and 13% on transport.

They had just touched down to spend three weeks teaching in our secondary schools. Now in its second year, the Shanghai-England teacher exchange is one of the most valuable education initiatives undertaken by our government over the past few years. Why are we so keen to learn about Shanghai mathematics teaching? Because Shanghai, a city of 24 million people, tops the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) international league table for maths achievement, and by a considerable margin. (China does not participate as a country but is represented by Shanghai and Hong Kong). At the age of 15, Shanghai pupils are studying work equivalent to the second year of A-level, while our pupils are still studying for their GCSE. What\u2019s more, the children of the poorest 30% of Shanghai\u2019s population are outstripping at mathematics the children of our wealthiest 10% in England. Clearly, Shanghai teachers are doing something right.   Related: Shanghai teaching method 'could improve UK results within four years'    There are many who try to attribute Shanghai\u2019s achievement to supposed socio-cultural explanations. These critics point towards \u201ctiger mothers\u201d, China\u2019s growing economy, or the deferential nature of Chinese society to explain away their success. These crude national stereotypes are not the issue; it is simply narrow-mindedness to insist that there is nothing we can learn from finding out what happens inside Shanghai\u2019s classrooms. Once inside, we can see that Shanghai teaching is very different from what we too often see in England. This could be seen from the BBC documentary Chinese School, aired over the summer. I recently met Jun Yang-Williams, the science teacher from the programme, who (though the producers neglected to mention this fact) has taught in English schools for the past 10 years. Having started her career teaching in China\u2019s Xi\u2019an province, Yang-Williams is in a privileged position to compare schools in both countries. In a letter she wrote to me following our meeting, she explained: \u201cIt seems to me that British schools have almost dismissed the \u2018teacher-led\u2019 teaching style \u2026 Although the \u2018teacher-led\u2019 pedagogy is seen as passive, it does not necessarily jeopardise learning outcomes. Students are in fact more proactive and more responsible for their learning.\u201d    Shanghai mathematics teaching works because it is meticulous    Last year, Professor David Reynolds of Southampton University, and postgraduate research student Zhenzhen Miao, tested 562 nine- and 10-year-olds from Southampton and from Nanjing in China, using maths tests from the international research project Timss. The average Chinese score was 83%, and the average English score was 56%. More interesting than this was when the researchers videoed lessons in both countries, to find out what teaching methods were being used. The answer was clear: in Chinese classrooms, whole-class teaching made up 72% of lesson time, compared with 24% in England. In addition, Shanghai mathematics teaching is based upon high-quality teacher resources. All schools follow the same textbook, which is published by the Shanghai education commission and refined and revised on an annual basis. Compare this with English schools, where, according to the Timss international survey, only 10% of mathematics teachers used textbooks as a basis for their teaching.   Related: China\u2019s schools are testing factories. Why is Britain so keen to copy them? | Simon Jenkins    An enormous amount of thought and care has gone into the construction of the Shanghai mathematics curriculum, and it is anything but a straitjacket for teachers. These high-quality resources simply provide the foundation upon which creative and imaginative teaching can be built. No teacher is delivering someone else\u2019s script. Teaching in England is still hobbled by the misplaced idea that teacher instruction is irredeemably boring. But anyone who has visited Shanghai will know this is not the case. Primary and secondary teachers involved in the exchange have returned to England beaming at how interactive whole-class teaching in Shanghai can be. Though teaching large classes, Shanghai teachers are constantly asking and answering questions, inviting pupils to demonstrate solutions on the board, and quizzing pupils about their thinking. And as for the myth that all Shanghai pupils are miserable, we know this is untrue because the pupils have said so themselves. The 2012 Pisa survey asked pupils whether they agreed with the following statement: \u201cI feel happy at school.\u201d In Shanghai, 85% of pupils agreed with the statement, which was above the OECD average, and above \u2013 I am sorry to say \u2013 the United Kingdom.

His life was so complex, his achievements so multifarious, his personality so unfathomable, the myths so pervasive, that I was sure that if I was to understand him I would have to cast my net very wide, at the same time as going deep down under the surface; one volume, I knew, could never do him justice. Multi-volume biographies are by no means encouraged in the trade. When Nick Hern, who initially commissioned the book, and I went to see the much-admired American publisher Aaron Asher, I told him I wanted to write it in three volumes. The first, I said, would end with Citizen Kane (1941), the second with Chimes at Midnight (1965), and the third, dealing with his unfulfilled last two decades, would be a novel. The great man looked at me pityingly. \u201cIf you are very lucky,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will be allowed to write the book in two volumes \u2013 neither of which will be a novel.\u201d Then he pointed to Michael Holroyd\u2019s Bernard Shaw: first volume bestseller; second volume very successful; third volume poor sales; fourth volume remaindered almost the moment it appeared. I accepted his wisdom and set to: volume one up to Kane; volume two the rest. That was the summer of 1989. Welles had only been dead four years, I had just turned 40.     Welles in Citizen Kane (1941). Photograph: Allstar/RKO    I was determined that, unlike the Laughton book \u2013 for which I had simply seen all the films, read all the available published sources and interviewed a few easily accessible people \u2013 the Welles biography would be a work of serious scholarship. It was originally planned to be an account of his extraordinary and little-known work in the theatre. Tearing through my modest advance in a matter of weeks, I crossed the US plundering archives, libraries and museums, obsessively photocopying and microfiching, peering at blurred and fuzzy documents which took long and painful months to decipher; I went through the European collections, I tracked down obscure doctoral theses, again painstakingly photocopied \u2013 no internet, no email, back then, of course. Across two continents I interviewed everybody who had ever worked with him in the theatre \u2013 actors, writers, producers, designers, lighting designers, understudies, stage managers, secretaries. This proved to be an emotional business. There was hilarity, but often there were tears \u2013 of regret, of tenderness, very often of frustration. Welles had stirred people up deeply: they had invested in him and he had often squandered their investment. The highway to Welles frequently proved to be a boulevard of broken dreams. In some few cases there was outright hatred and contempt; always, without exception, the memory of the man was vivid. Like him or loathe him, once you had encountered Orson Welles, you could never forget him. More and more as I spoke to his old muckers, they said I shouldn\u2019t waste my time on just one aspect of his work: I should write a full biography. Nothing written about Welles, they said, had captured the man they knew. It was at that point, in perfect innocence, that Nick and I went to meet Asher. I reckoned the two volumes would take three, maybe four years at most. I started to rethink that immediately. I now had to take on board every film, every radio show, every documentary; yet more archives, yet more photocopying, yet more interviews. For a while, I more or less took up residence at Indiana University in Bloomington, where the greatest Welles collection is to be found. Having started with little paper filing boxes, I began buying great metal cabinets \u2013 soon I was up to six. I had made a vow that I would visit every place of significance in his life, which took me to Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he was born; Chicago, where he was brought up; Ireland, where he had his first job in the theatre; Spain, France, Italy, where he had done so much of his work. Once news of my undertaking got out, I quickly became part of the loose-knit but vast community of Wellesians, all of whom were remarkably generous and freely shared their work and thoughts. Jonathan Rosenbaum, editor of This Is Orson Welles, an indispensable digest of the interviews Welles did with Peter Bogdanovich in preparation for the autobiography he never wrote; Fran\u00e7ois Thomas, a diligent and inspired sleuth who, with Jean-Pierre Berthom\u00e9, has intrepidly tracked down the true facts of Welles\u2019s working methods, dispelling some of the myths; Jim Naremore, shrewdest of all the Wellesian commentators; Richard France, historian of Welles\u2019s theatre work. Early on, I was invited to the Venice Biennale for a symposium on Welles. Eager to know who was speaking, I opened the agenda on arrival to discover that I was. I rapidly put together a speech in which I spoke in very simple terms of Welles as an actor: his particular gifts, vocal, physical, mental. My address was greeted with numbed amazement. Welles was at the time in the grip of the semioticians: everything was polyvalent, polysemous, above all polysyllabic. Welles\u2019s mistress and collaborator Oja Kodar was sitting near me, intently taking notes throughout. I peered over at her notepad \u2013 she had been doing some rather suggestive doodles. My closest confidants were two extraordinary women: Paula Laurence, Broadway star, diseuse and needle-sharp analyst of the passing scene; and Ann Rogers, Welles\u2019s secretary for 30 years. By coincidence, Ann had been Laughton\u2019s secretary, and, just as she had done with Laughton, she tested my mettle at every point till she was convinced that I was serious and my intentions were honourable. She had already seen off one muck-raking biographer, telling him she wasn\u2019t in the business of dishing the dirt. \u201cLady,\u201d he had replied, \u201cno dirt no book.\u201d She fed me more and more priceless information, providing me with entries from her diary, memos, photographs, scripts \u2013 regularly sending me personal items: \u201cThis is the flannel Mr Welles wiped his brow with on the first night of Moby-Dick in London.\u201d Crucially, she gave other survivors of Welles\u2019s private circle permission to talk to me.         Chimes at Midnight official trailer    As for Paula, she was my Deep Throat, giving me lead after lead. She had known Welles since he was the new kid on the block in New York, and been Helen of Troy to his Dr Faustus in 1937. She had observed him closely, and knew where all the bodies were buried; she had watched him handle and sometimes mishandle his unruly talent with sharp concern. At the first night of his disastrous New York King Lear in 1956, she had sat in the stalls with Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and wept. A third consigliere was George Fanto, an amiable Hungarian who had been Welles\u2019s cameraman on It\u2019s All True in Brazil in 1942 and his stage director on a bizarre double bill he wrote for the Paris theatre in 1950. Fanto saw another Welles \u2013 a man who was essentially deeply religious, preoccupied by questions of good and evil, a great and gallant leader, a genius and a healer. There were as many Welleses as interviewees. I stopped trying to make them cohere. Instead I took as my watchword Whitman\u2019s great cry: \u201cDo I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d The first book, which I called The Road to Xanadu (1995), was wonderfully enjoyable to write, as phenomenal good luck sped Welles from one high to another, culminating in the release of Citizen Kane, but it was the end of my honeymoon with many Wellesians, who decided that because I didn\u2019t accept the party line \u2013 that Welles was the guiltless victim of a terrible and lifelong conspiracy \u2013 I was of the enemy camp.    Welles was deeply religious, preoccupied by questions of good and evil, a genius and a healer    Meanwhile, I knew that it was going to be impossible to tell the story of the rest of his life in just one more volume. He did too much, in too many different media, too many different genres, too many different countries. If I merely recounted his activities chronologically, neither Welles nor his work would be illuminated. I tried to devise what I called a Wellesian approach, where some things would be in extreme closeup, pulling out to an extreme wide shot. I would pan up into certain events, then proceed in a series of jump cuts. Sometimes I believed what I was saying, but eventually I acknowledged to myself \u2013 and, with much forelock-tugging, to the publisher \u2013 that volume two (Hello Americans, published in 2006) would cover only the five crucial and little understood years after the debacle of The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) and Welles\u2019s banishment from RKO, when he attempted to conquer new worlds \u2013 of print journalism, radio comedy and campaigning politics. In these five years he also managed (with difficulty) to direct The Stranger, his only financial success as a director, and the short-lived Broadway musical Around the World (a financial disaster), both in 1946, and The Lady from Shanghai and the 23-day shoot of Macbeth in 1948. It was a staggeringly active and complex period, and needed a book to itself. The rest of his life, I blithely promised, would easily fit into a third volume. And then, three years ago, I started writing it. I had pooh-poohed all the many wiseacres who told me I was going to have to write a fourth volume, but in January, knowing that the book had to come out this year, the centenary of Welles\u2019s birth, I caved in. If I had carried on, the book would have been hernia-inducingly heavy, and it would have been a gabble. The nearly 20 years covered by the book represent such a rollercoaster that, to prevent the reader from experiencing vertigo, I had to put my foot on the brake, to examine what exactly was going on, but despite numerous diversions and disasters, the story has a kind of inexorable drive towards the film Welles considered, and I consider, his masterpiece: Chimes at Midnight.   Related: Citizen Kane and the meaning of Rosebud    Along the way were many roads not taken, roads that might have led to glorious departures, but such is life. Such, certainly, was Welles\u2019s life, a life like no other. He was a man like no other. When I started writing about him, I set out to separate the myth and the man. But by the time he was 30, the man had become the myth. He often behaved in extravagant, bewildering, self-defeating ways, but equally often with magnificent, inspiring generosity. He was funny, terrifying, creative, destructive, kind, cruel, and all on the largest scale. A stubborn lack of self-knowledge condemned him to repeat his errors. His successes and his failures were equally titanic; he created some of the most memorable films and striking theatre of the 20th century. His tiny body of TV work pointed to possibilities for the medium that nobody bothered to take up. He was fearless in his experiments, and he never did any of it for the money, just for the sheer joy of making films. Because of this, he has inspired more directors than any other film-maker, but he leaves no legacy: he really was a one-off. If I had written twice as much about him, I would still find him fascinating.

The Martian, in which the China National Space Administration saves both Nasa\u2019s and Matt Damon\u2019s asses, has just opened strongly over there with $50.1m (\u00a333.3m). You can\u2019t discount the importance of being the autumn\u2019s breakout blockbuster elsewhere \u2013 but nor can Ridley Scott\u2019s plot choices be dismissed, especially in the light of other films that have climbed on board what Colbert has dubbed the \u201cPander Express\u201d. Roland Emmerich\u2019s 2012 wasn\u2019t the first tentpole release to do it (that was probably Mission: Impossible 3, a little too early in 2006).            The Martian \u2013 video review    But having the Chinese army save the day saw an unmistakeable bounce ($68.7m) in that country for a relatively star-light film in 2009. Skyfall\u2019s Shanghai and Macau-set scenes were partly censored, but the Bond franchise still more than doubled its take there (Skyfall: $59.2m; Quantum of Solace: $21m). Transformers: Age of Extinction trashed Hong Kong on its way to a Hollywood record in China ($320m) that stood until Furious 7 this year. Some of these leaps are admittedly difficult to untangle from Chinese box-office growth overall. The one that undeniably outperforms even that is Iron Man 3, which came in a separate, tailored version (ie with a couple of extra scenes) and whose marketing was carefully honed by local powerhouse DMG. The result: a stupendous hike from previous Iron Mans (1: $15.2m; 2: $7.9m; 3: $121.2m). Now imagine what Hollywood could achieve with an actual Chinese protagonist. The forgotten Pixar film Delayed by 18 months, ditching Up co-director Bob Peterson on the way, The Good Dinosaur has \u201cdevelopment hell\u201d stamped all over it. After Pixar\u2019s Inside Out tickled both intellectual and emotional hemispheres of the brain in the summer to widespread rapture, there has been an almost total lack of anticipation for its second film of 2015. The Good Dinosaur\u2019s $39.2m US debut this weekend is unsurprisingly a disappointment by Pixar standards; the studio\u2019s lowest ever, if you take inflation into account.            The Good Dinosaur - video review    But perhaps given the lack of marketing oomph behind it, it\u2019s not a complete disaster. Rather than its conceptually highfalutin studio mates, better comparison points might be the fellow prehistoric-themed CGI cartoons Ice Age and The Croods. The Good Dinosaur still lags behind on both \u2013 especially if you factor in inflation for 2002\u2019s Ice Age \u2013 but stays within their range, both in the US and other key territories (US: IA, $46.3m; Cr, $43.6m, TGD, $39.2m / UK: IA, $4.3m; Cr, $8m, TGD, $4.3m / Mexico: IA, $5.9m; Cr, $4.3m, TGD, $3.6m). No one is pretending this is Pixar\u2019s finest hour. But the stone-age setting (always reliably generic global blockbuster fodder), fable-like simplicity and genuinely stunning landscape rendering should carry The Good Dinosaur a respectable distance worldwide. The budget is an intimidating $200m, but Pixar has yet to have a true commercial failure \u2013 even with less critically fawned-over works such as Cars and Monsters University. The Croods made $587.2m in 2013; if The Good Dinosaur gets close, it will enter Pixar\u2019s top 10.  The local champ With a $30.1m three-day US debut, or $42.6m counted over the full Thanksgiving holiday, Rocky spin-off Creed is dancing like a butterfly, if not quite stinging like a bee. That is the 10th highest Thanksgiving opening \u2013 and social-media buzz is rapidly coalescing around Ryan Coogler\u2019s film, which follows the son of Balboa\u2019s one-time rival Apollo Creed as he tries to launch his own boxing career. With discussion partly focusing on an enlightened, laidback attitude to race relations, Creed reinforces the sense that 2015 \u2013 after Straight Outta Compton\u2019s $161m gross \u2013 has seen African-American film intersect with the mainstream more comfortably than before. Heartening, given the agonising resurgence of America\u2019s problem with police brutality, which has now drawn in Quentin Tarantino. On a side note, it\u2019s also great to see mainstream-impacting films driven by specific, topographically rooted cultural factors, as opposed to the bland globalised gruel of so many digital blockbusters.    Related: Creed review \u2013 new Rocky movie is a split decision    The downside to that, box office-wise, is that their reach is probably limited. Straight Outta Compton was heavily US-slanted (80.4%); outside of four key markets \u2013 the UK ($12.2m), Australia ($8.7m), Germany ($5.4m) and France ($3.4m) \u2013 it didn\u2019t do significant business. Rather surprising, considering hip-hop\u2019s worldwide catchment area. Creed, which debuted in seven overseas markets this weekend, went out lower than Compton in Australia ($1.2m to SOC\u2019s $3.1m), higher in the UAE ($333K to SOC\u2019s $87K). Fairly modest stuff. It\u2019ll have to work Sylvester Stallone\u2019s presence hard (if he truly has any long-distance cachet these days), plus any awards talk that might snowball from its US buzz, in order to register internationally. Beyond Hollywood            Two Chinese newcomers this week: in the finest noir tradition is the incomprehensibly complicated thriller The Vanished Murderer, in at No 12 globally with $6m; and at No 15, grossing $4.7m, is action-comedy Bad Guys Always Die, teaming up prolific Taiwanese star Chen Bolin and South Korea\u2019s Son Ye-jin for a caper on Jeju island \u2013 a popular holiday destination for both countries. The future            It\u2019s the global release window before Christmas, and very little will be stirring until the lightsabres are sparked up in a little over two and a half weeks\u2019 time. Universal\u2019s Yule horror Krampus takes on 25 markets this weekend \u2013 though, given the lack of stars and the somewhat awkwardly dichotomised tone laid out in the trailer, we probably shouldn\u2019t expect too much. Perhaps hoping to exploit the pre-Star Wars lull, Warner Bros is releasing its Point Break remake in China on 3 December, three weeks before the Xmas-weekend US release. The very marginal set of territories accompanying it then, and the fact that the UK opening has been shifted back into February, suggest that the studio \u2013 which has had an abysmal year \u2013 doesn\u2019t have total confidence in it. But a good result in China might get audiences elsewhere to buy Luke Bracey in the Keanu Reeves role, which helped make the 1991 original so guiltily pleasurable. Then again, the $100m film could just as easily be wiped off the map by a decent hold from The Martian, as well as debuting Chinese sci-fi comedy Impossible, which has a formidable triumvirate of local megastars on deck in the shape of Wang Baoqiang (Lost in Thailand), Xiaoshenyang and Da Peng (Jian Bing Man).

As Andy Murray and his team-mates savoured their moment, there was no hiding either their immense satisfaction at having won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years, or their despondency over the future. It may be that, because of a packed schedule, Murray plays only one tie in defence of the title in 2016 \u2013 against Japan in March. He could come back if Great Britain are still alive in the competition towards the end of the year, but there is a sense the job has been done. Whether Leon Smith, the captain who has lifted the squad from ignominy to glory in five years, will be at the helm is also uncertain. He has ambitions to coach on the Tour.   Related: Andy Murray demands action from LTA to capitalise on Davis Cup glory    Disturbingly, it also sounds as if the Lawn Tennis Association chief executive, Michael Downey, does not have the total confidence of the game\u2019s leading players, most importantly Murray. The structure Downey is trying to build, from the ground up, may well bear fruit eventually. In his defence, he has much damage to repair after years of complacency and poor judgment that resulted in top-end profligacy. But there is no sign that, since his appointment in September 2013, the Canadian with the ready smile properly gets it. There is, for example, no convincing push to capitalise on the deeds of the nation\u2019s best player since Fred Perry \u2013 nor has there been since Murray won Wimbledon two years ago. Where are the indoor courts in a country that for many months is drenched and cold? Where are the training partners at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton? Why is Murray\u2019s face not plastered over every bus in London? Euphoria can hide a thousand ills. Underneath the glittering surface, there is precious little to celebrate after beating Belgium 3-1 on Sunday, and all these players \u2013 Murray, his brother, Jamie, young Kyle Edmund, not so young James Ward and the ever-loyal doubles standby Dominic Inglot \u2013 struggled to disguise their frustration. Murray, whose final lob of David Goffin put a sublime full stop to the narrative here on Sunday evening, expressed it best. Did he expect British tennis to exploit the deeds of the team over the past few days? \u201cI hope so but they need to act on it now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no use doing it in 18 months. Start now. It should have started before today. It\u2019s time to make some positive changes so that things get better.\u201d He said he had not spoken to Downey since the first round of the cup in Glasgow in February. \u201cSometimes I feel like you waste time because nothing ever gets done. I also don\u2019t want to waste my time talking about stuff. I\u2019ll have a lot more time to try to help or give back to the game. But just now, I\u2019ve got to concentrate on trying to win as much as possible.     Players use the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton. Photograph: Hamish Blair/Getty Images    \u201cI don\u2019t get to see what is going on in schools in terms of the grassroots level but there are a few people who I am extremely close to [his mother, Judy, most obviously], and I respect their opinions. They believe a lot more could be done and should be done to capitalise on all of this success in British tennis over the last five or six years. We may never get a better opportunity to do that than now. \u201cI don\u2019t think the participation is really going up. I think the performance stuff at Roehampton \u2013 whether you agreed with having the National Tennis Centre or not \u2013 is there, so use it. There is no one to practise with, which makes things a bit frustrating because you want to have the best possible practice and training to prepare for the biggest events. We often have to travel abroad to practice. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the next generation are. I feel like I am saying \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 a lot, but I genuinely don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t speak to any of the people about that who are in a high-up position. I haven\u2019t really spoken to them about anything. \u201cIt is a shame because \u2013 regardless of whether or not we had a load of players at the top of the professional game \u2013 we always had good juniors. We had junior No1s, we had juniors competing for grand slams on the guys\u2019 and the girls\u2019 side. Now it seems that isn\u2019t really happening.\u201d           Andy Murray hails unforgettable Davis Cup victory    Since the US Open in 2013 when four British boys entered, and all lost in the first round, there have been none at any of the slams. Murray said: \u201cKatie Swan is a very good young girl but there are not loads coming through. It is not to say there won\u2019t be players who will break through.\u201d   Related: Andy Murray\u2019s Davis Cup heroics confirm him as a British sporting legend | Jacob Steinberg    Jamie agreed: \u201cI hear from people who are in the know \u2013 and I guess throughout the country \u2013 that [grassroots development] is not happening as much as it could be. I have said it a million times: it is a shame that Andy has done such amazing things in his career and for tennis in this country \u2013 and of course we have won the Davis Cup \u2013 but it has not been capitalised on. He is the one who has captured the interest of the people, not just this weekend but throughout his career. Now we have got a good chance to make the most of it. We have the opportunity to make tennis really popular in this country.\u201d Smith has not renegotiated his contract with the LTA, although Downey, who regards him as the best Davis Cup captain in the world, is keen to keep him. Smith, however, was quick to emphasise that winning the Davis Cup was not down to the LTA. \u201cNo, that\u2019s a separate thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an LTA thing. This is a Davis Cup team. It\u2019s about these guys. It is a team, it is down to what these guys do on court.\u201d Edmund is the one player familiar with the current setup at Roehampton. \u201cI have probably spent most of my time at the national tennis centre,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is pretty much my base when I go back to the UK. But for me there are no players to hit with. So people will come in to hit from various centres. \u201cThe way it has worked out this year I have been on the road a lot so when I have gone back it has been for a week, maximum two weeks. It is manageable. But it is nice to know there are players there. It is healthy to have players around as well, it makes a good atmosphere. It is good for the spirit. It is good for the game as well. When you are just one person in a centre or one of just a couple of people it is no good. It is definitely something that should be backed \u2013 more players playing at the national tennis centre.\u201d   Related: Andy Murray serves up 5 million viewers for Davis Cup win    Murray added: \u201cI went to the National Centre to practise for a couple of days after Shanghai, I was there on a Monday at like two, three o\u2019clock and then on Tuesday, the same time, there was not one person using any of the indoor courts and not one person in the gym. I took photos of it because the place cost like \u00a340m and there are no people. No players in there practising in there. It was like empty. There is nothing going on there at all. And, you know, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be performance players, but there\u2019s just nothing going on. And it\u2019s such a shame, like, walking in there and there\u2019s nobody in there.\u201d Smith said: \u201cThere are enough people at the LTA to try to ensure that [winning the Davis Cup is not wasted]. That is Michael\u2019s job \u2013 to try to come up with a strategy that best captivates all the people who will have watched at the weekend, and watched the whole year unfold. The important thing is to act on it. It is not about what happens in the next few days. There will be plenty of coverage \u2013 it is about how we reel them in and keep them in. That has got to be at the forefront of their minds and hopefully they do it well, because it would be a shame not to capitalise. With what Andy has done in his career, there should be a legacy.\u201d Murray will now train his sights on the Australian Open, which starts in eight weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve been very close there a number of years. I haven\u2019t won there but I think I\u2019ve often played my best tennis.I really like the conditions, the courts. That\u2019s obviously my next big goal. I haven\u2019t seen Am\u00e9lie [Mauresmo, his coach] for four months or so. I need to push on with that, spend as much time on court as I can to work with my coaching team on the weaknesses in my game.\u201d He has another small matter on his mind, of course. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going to happen with Kim and the birth yet so I can\u2019t say 10% certain. But, if everything goes to plan, then Davis Cup in March against Japan will be my first tournament. Next year if we were to win the first round, the quarter-final is a very tricky time, with the Olympics as well.

The shack she shares with her husband and four children in Dhaka, the nation\u2019s capital, sits on the edge of the sprawling Korail slum \u2013 next to a lake. When it rains, dank water sloshes into their shelter. Only the bed, raised up on bricks, stays dry. \u201cThis room is all we have, so we need to stay here no matter what happens,\u201d said Akter. Seven years ago, a monsoon flood left nothing standing in their village, located in Bhola on the country\u2019s south-west coast. \u201cWe had no option but to climb up the banks with our belongings immediately,\u201d said Akter. \u201cWithin a week, we moved to Dhaka to start a new life.\u201d Every day, some 2,000 people settle in the Bangladeshi capital. It\u2019s nothing new \u2013 for generations the city has been a magnet for men and women escaping rural poverty. But now there\u2019s another driver that experts say has accelerated the race to the capital: the Earth\u2019s changing climate, which has already made life extremely difficult in stretches of this pancake-flat country threaded with rivers. In the coming decades, millions more \u201cclimate refugees\u201d around the world are expected to make similar journeys. In a cruel irony, many will wind up in cities even more ill-equipped to withstand the changing climate.     Parul Akter and her daughter in Dhaka\u2019s Korail slum. Photograph: Poppy McPherson    Bangladesh contributes just 0.4 metric tonnes per capita to the carbon emissions fuelling climate change (the US produces 17 and the UK 7.1), but will suffer its effects badly. Within three decades, the country is expected to be at least 2C hotter. By 2080, the seas could be 2ft higher. The glaciers in the Himalayas will melt faster, sending more floodwaters to batter the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones will wrack the coast more frequently, and with more intensity. Salty seawater will pollute drinking supplies. Fertile land will be destroyed.    In a cruel irony, many refugees will wind up in cities even more ill-equipped to withstand the changing climate    Some of this is already happening. There have not been many studies indisputably tying Bangladesh\u2019s rural exodus to climate. But research indicates that the majority of migrants hail from coastal areas that are already experiencing rising sea levels, increased salinity, destructive floods and cyclones. At least 400,000 people move to Dhaka every year, according to the World Bank, while the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates that 70% of Dhaka\u2019s slum-dwellers moved there fleeing some sort of environmental shock. In 2012, A S Moniruzzaman Khan, the director of the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research at BRAC University, tracked 1,500 families migrating to cities, mostly Dhaka. Almost all cited the changing environment as the biggest reason for their decision. They were struggling to find fresh water to drink, as rising seas spilled into rivers.  \u201cTen years back, the area was freshwater \u2013 now it is not,\u201d Khan said. He heard of women and children having to walk an extra five hours each day to find clean water. The task was considered too dangerous, so men went instead \u2013 taking a sizeable chunk out of the earnings of the family\u2019s main breadwinner. \u201cIf you provide water, this migration issue would probably never come,\u201d said Khan.     The banks of Dhaka\u2019s Buriganga River. Photograph: Poppy McPherson    It\u2019s not just Bangladesh. All over the world, people are or will be on the move \u2013 in Africa, largely due to drought; in Asia, floods. By 2060, there could be between 25 million and 1 billion environmental migrants. And cities will be their primary destination. Foresight, a UK government research body, says that by 2060 there will be 192 million more people living in vulnerable urban coastal floodplains, mainly in Asia. \u201cThose moving to water-stressed or low-lying coastal cities in developing countries may paradoxically find themselves exposed to greater climate-change related risks,\u201d a 2014 report by IOM reads.  Part of the problem is population. Asia\u2019s megacities show no signs of shrinking, even as rising sea levels render them more vulnerable to storm surges.  A 2011 study of the 20 most populous cities expected to be exposed to coastal flooding by 2070 placed Dhaka third, behind Mumbai and Calcutta. Also in the top 10 are Guangzhou, Ho Chi Min City, Shanghai, Bangkok and Yangon. Miami is the only city in a developed country to feature on the list.  But despite the challenges, solutions for environmental migrants rarely feature on urban development plans. Climate refugees still have no legal standing under international law. No binding global agreements contain provisions for them, despite the first assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990 suggesting that \u201cthe gravest effects of climate change may be those on human migration\u201d.  Specialists had hoped that the climate talks in Paris starting on 30 November would persuade countries to prioritise the issue. But environmental migration has reportedly been removed from the final agenda, though it could be reintroduced during negotiations.

The slums, already home to hundreds of thousands, are expanding rapidly. Within two decades, the city\u2019s population could double to 30 million.    Within three decades, Bangladesh is expected to be at least 2C hotter. By 2080, the seas could be 2ft higher    \u201cEvery boat has a carrying capacity, every city has a carrying capacity,\u201d said Sarder Shafiqul Alam, a senior researcher at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development and Bangladesh\u2019s representative at the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s Asian Climate Change Resilience Network. \u201cIf that carrying capacity is over-burdened and over-burdened, what will happen? Boat will capsize. City will do something like that.\u201d  People coming to Dhaka after environmental disasters face more problems, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting enough safe water to drink; they\u2019re not getting sanitation facilities.\u201d In yet another irony, even though Dhaka is prone to flooding, it is also running dry. About 90% of the city\u2019s water supplies come from ground reserves, which are depleted by three metres a year. There\u2019s a supply-demand gap of 500m litres a day, according to a 2014 report, leading to chronic shortages and protests in the summer months.     Members of the Devi family sit on a bed above floodwaters in the village of Chajan Mania. Photograph: Gideon Mendel/Corbis     Long-term groundwater depletion causes the earth to sink, which exacerbates flooding, a major problem in Dhaka. It can also lead to the intrusion of salty water into the supply \u2013 the same problem that contributes to rural-urban migration. On the face of it, climate change is poised to be the latest disaster to cripple Bangladesh, a nation that has been beset by compounding crises since it was founded in 1971.  But Bangladeshis are accustomed to bouncing back. Or, as Khan puts it: \u201cOur people like to face challenges.\u201d  The country boasts the world\u2019s largest non-profit, BRAC, and is the birthplace of micro-finance, thanks to Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus. Armies of field workers have responded to climate challenges with innovation. Farmers whose salt-washed land is unfit to grow regular rice have turned to salt-tolerant strains, or raised shrimp instead. And there has been a concerted effort to persuade villagers not to leave their homes.   Related: Climate change and cities: a prime source of problems, yet key to a solution    Some people argue, however, that environmental migrants have a legal claim to be resettled on public land. S M Mahmudul Hasan, 55, a community leader at Korail, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the residents, mostly families who migrated from places such as Bhola and Barial. \u201cThey have lost their houses in natural disasters and have had no income in the villages,\u201d he said.

Beijing authorities claimed they had forced vehicles off the roads and shut more than 2,000 polluting companies in order to tackle the crisis.  But environmentalists attacked the government for failing to declare a pollution \u201cred alert\u201d, despite the appalling conditions. \u201cThe shocking levels of air pollution we have seen in the last few days are a serious danger to the health of hundreds of millions of citizens,\u201d said Dong Liansai, Greenpeace\u2019s climate campaigner in China. \u201cMoreover, the Beijing city government\u2019s insufficient alerting system has compounded the problem.\u201d Nut Brother said he began plotting his one-man anti-smog campaign in 2013 when a now infamous spell of pollution \u2013 dubbed China\u2019s inaugural \u201cairpocalypse\u201d \u2013 saw flights grounded, motorways closed and hospitals packed with wheezing patients suffering from respiratory complaints. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy,\u201d the artist said of the smog, which scientists blame for about 4,000 deaths a day in China, most caused by heart and lung problems and strokes. \u201cYou have nowhere to hide.

Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP    Nut Brother, who was born in Hubei province and is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, began to execute his plan in July after convincing a restaurant owner to contribute 10,000 yuan (\u00a31,000) to his pollution-themed performance art project. He ordered a vacuum cleaner from a manufacturer in Shanghai and began taking it on four-hour sorties across Beijing\u2019s urban sprawl, gobbling up pollutants as he went. Photographs published in the Chinese media this week showed him pushing his vacuum cleaner past some of Beijing\u2019s most celebrated landmarks. One image shows him sucking up dust outside Rem Koolhaas\u2019s cloud-puncturing China Central Television headquarters; in another he is seen strolling past the portrait of Mao Zedong at the entrance to the Forbidden City.  Nut Brother said his attempts to suck up smog from Tiananmen Square \u2013 perhaps the most heavily guarded public space on earth \u2013 had triggered his only brush with the law. \u201cThey sent a plainclothes policeman to follow me but they didn\u2019t impede my movements,\u201d he recalled.           Smog chokes cities in China    Chinese websites and social networks were covered with reports of the artist\u2019s quirky smog-harvesting campaign on Tuesday in Beijing. Reporters flocked to the artist\u2019s temporary home \u2013 a 60-yuan-a-night youth hostel near the Lama Temple \u2013 to see his vacuum cleaner up close. \u201cIt is terrible today,\u201d he complained of the latest bout of severe pollution, Beijing\u2019s worst of the year.

The first, highlighted by this revolutionary purchase of a 13% stake in the umbrella City Football Group to China Media Capital (CMC), a Chinese state-backed investment conglomerate, is the overarching global ambition of the Abu Dhabi ownership. An initial perception that City was a rich prince\u2019s indulgence when Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan bought the club in 2008 has ceded to a realisation that the intention is to make serious money out of it, and this deal values City at a round US$3bn (\u00a31.99bn) and rising. The second, seen in City\u2019s position at the top of the Premier League \u2013 which their expensively bought, all-star team are the favourites to win \u2013 and in their qualification for the Champions League knockout stage, is the financial muscle and seriousness being applied to the football operations themselves. The third, perhaps most surreal given City\u2019s former status as Manchester\u2019s gloom-laden, perennially cocking-up second club, is the geo-political power of the men now in charge; who, wearing their Abu Dhabi government hats, wield forceful diplomatic influence at 10 Downing Street, as the Guardian has revealed. While City are still owned by Mansour, who bought them from a former Thailand prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in a private equity deal, the club are run by the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, who in his senior financial and political roles reports to Mansour\u2019s brother, the crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed, seen as the de facto ruler in Abu Dhabi, where he is deputy supreme commander of the armed forces. The fourth, exemplified by last week\u2019s announcement that City will develop a new club badge, returning to the round design dearly loved by fans of 60s and 70s vintage, is the expertise the Abu Dhabi executives have applied to the detail of running a modern English football club, understanding they need to soften the commercial zeal by nurturing, not ripping off, local sentiment.   Related: Manchester City owners announce \u00a3265m deal with Chinese investors    They now take the machine they have built, the trio of City clubs they own in Manchester, New York and Melbourne, and the youth development, scouting, marketing and logistics operations which service them, into China \u2013 potentially the biggest future football market of all. In doing so as full partners with CMC, a company supported by China\u2019s communist government, City move ahead of other Premier League clubs, many of whom have long tried to figure out how to capitalise on Chinese interest. While the Glazer family\u2019s sweating of multiple international sponsorships for United has been envied by other clubs as a lucrative commercial model, this more substantial partnership minted by City could herald a round of similar ventures in China and elsewhere. This move will enable the Abu Dhabi owners to seriously expand into China, commercially selling the clubs, principally Manchester City, as brands, and the allied companies which are constituted to provide services and expertise outside the City group. The intention of the alliance is also to service the aspirations of the Chinese government, whose president, Xi Jinping, earlier this year announced a 50-point plan to make China a \u201csoccer powerhouse\u201d. The City operations will expect to contribute substantially to the requirements for more coaches, academies and building a football infrastructure, while also capitalising on the burgeoning Chinese television following for the Premier League. City explained this in their statement announcing the partnership, saying: \u201cthe deal will create an unprecedented platform for the growth of City Football Group clubs and companies in China and internationally, borne out of CFG\u2019s ability to provide a wealth of industry expertise and resources to the rapidly developing Chinese football industry.\u201d Ruigang Li, the influential Shanghai communist party member who founded and is the chairman of CMC, talked in the statement about \u201cunprecedented growth opportunities\u201d for developing football with City Football Group\u2019s \u201cdifferentiated systematic approach to building a global platform\u201d, and pointed to the Chinese government\u2019s political ambition in the 50-point plan, including to host a future World Cup. \u201cWe and our consortium partner CITIC Capital also see this investment as a prime opportunity for furthering the contribution of China to the global football family,\u201d he said. The statement said the parties had taken six months to find the right structure, culminating in the issue of new shares for a 13% stake in City Football Group. With the \u00a3265m paid for that, the City group has cash to invest independent of Mansour\u2019s royal wealth, which they could spend building the new stadium required for New York City, the MLS franchise acquired two years ago. The Chinese partnership was enabled by the top-level political connections between the countries, most visible here when Mubarak hosted president Xi at the Etihad Stadium during Xi\u2019s lavish state visit to Britain last month. On the day, the Chinese former City player Sun Jihai, who weeks earlier was appointed a City ambassador to China, was enrolled in the hall of fame at Manchester\u2019s National Football Museum, a status which prompted widespread bewilderment within football. Last month, the Guardian revealed internal United Arab Emirates documents which showed that Sheikh Mohammed, and Mubarak in his role as political adviser, pointed out to David Cameron and the British ambassador the UAE\u2019s large financial investments in the UK, while calling for a crackdown here on the Muslim Brotherhood, which the UAE forcibly opposes. In 2013, further documents showed a specific Whitehall unit was set up to secure investment from Mubadala, the $70bn fund of which Sheikh Mohammed is the chairman and Mubarak the chief executive. Last year, Manchester City Council announced that Mansour\u2019s Abu Dhabi United Group is to build \u00a31bn worth of apartments in Manchester, following the acclaimed \u00a3200m building of City\u2019s academy and \u201ccampus\u201d in impoverished east Manchester, which included funding a local college and leisure centre. That, and the care the Abu Dhabi regime has taken to honour City\u2019s traditions and fans\u2019 diehard sentiment while spending more than \u00a31bn amassing players and becoming a football power, has won them acceptance in Manchester. City fans now boo the anthem of Uefa, the European governing body of football, principally because they believe its financial fair play rules have clipped the wings of owners from the Gulf most have greatly welcomed.

China\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection\u2019s (MEP) air quality index (AQI), the official measure of harmful pollutants in their air, has averaged over 400 micrograms per cubic metre for most of the day.

The WHO puts the safe level at 25. The city is currently experiencing its worst spell of air pollution of 2015. The environmental and health impacts to China of these high levels of air pollution are well documented, but it has direct impacts on businesses in the country too.      Reading on an air quality monitoring app on 1 December 2015 in Beijing. Photograph: How Hwee Young/EPA     In 2013 the MEP issued guidelines for businesses about how to tackle pollution, including suggestions that workers could take annual leave for smog days or work from home, but the measures were not mandatory. While there are legal limits for work environment factors such as temperature, companies are protected from loss of productivity due to smog by this lack of recognition. Some foreign companies such as Japanese electronics giant Panasonic, meanwhile, offer a \u2018\u201cpollution allowance\u201d\u2019 to foreign workers they base in Beijing to tempt them to stay there. The tourism industry is particularly vulnerable, with many believing that news reports about smog-cloaked Chinese cities have contributed to the recent downturn in international tourists visiting the country. \u201cThe branding of China is all around the Great Wall and Forbidden City near and inside Beijing, which is now covered in smog,\u201d says Roy Graff, managing director of tourism advisory firm China Contact. \u201cInternational tourists see that and attribute it to all of China, even though in the west of the country the air is pretty good.\u201d   Related: Bathtub booze and knock-off whisky: inside China's fake alcohol industry    As such, hotels in polluted cities are increasingly marketing themselves towards domestic tourists and international business travellers, who visit China regardless of pollution levels. Tour companies are acting too. \u201cNo tour operator would admit it on record, but I\u2019ve found that many that have focused on China are now selling more trips to south-east Asia to offset the downturn,\u201d says Graff. \u201cThey\u2019re diversifying to keep turnover up.\u201d The food and beverage industry is also affected. The marketing team of Mosto, a western-style restaurant in Beijing\u2019s busy Sanlitun shopping area, estimates it has a 30% decrease in walk-in business when the AQI is high. Nearby craft beer bar Jing A, a large venue usually packed with ale-swigging customers, saw trade drop by around 30% in early November during a week of particularly bad smog. However, when pollution peaks and people stay indoors to avoid it, some food delivery services enjoy sales spikes. Dao Jia, a meal delivery company that employs around 3,000 people across 10 Chinese cities, sees business increase by around 15% when the AQI is high. It\u2019s a particularly busy time for them now in Beijing. \u201cIn winter here, the public heating system that uses a lot of coal kicks in, so air pollution is heavier compared to the summer,\u201d says Sun Hao, CEO of the company. \u201cIt really helps us with order volume.\u201d   on 1 December 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Visitors walk outside the National Stadium in Beijing on 1 December 2015.

Staff at Moka Bros, a health-orientated sister restaurant to Mosto, claim it enjoys decent sales during smog days as customers crave healthy food and share photos of their meals on WeChat, China\u2019s hugely popular messaging app. Some actively use pollution as a marketing springboard. Isler, The Distillery bar owner, has air purifiers in his two bars that reduce AQI indoors to around a third of outside levels.

Sun Jihai, who played for Manchester City from 2002-08, said: \u2018I hope this co-operation helps Chinese football develop better and brings Manchester City more fans.\u2019 Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA    \u201cVulgar tycoon!\u201d wrote one of CMC\u2019s boss. \u201cThey are kissing Xi Jinping\u2019s arse,\u201d wrote another Weibo user. \u201cIdiots,\u201d fumed a third. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they use the money to develop the Chinese national team?\u201d Chinese media took a less critical tone with Caixin, the country\u2019s top financial magazine, celebrating the involement with one of Europe\u2019s top clubs. \u201cCity Football Group is the world\u2019s leading football management company,\u201d the magazine noted.

That crowd is likely balloon in size now City have become the first Premier League club to gain a solid foothold in the world\u2019s No\u00a02 economy. In an interview with Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post before the deal was announced, Omar Berrada, a commercial director at City Football Group, outlined wide-ranging plans to grow Manchester City\u2019s footprint in Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s massively important,\u201d he said of the region. \u201cThe stats tell you the sheer importance that Asia has for most, if not all, Premier League clubs.\u201d \u201cIn Manchester City\u2019s case specifically, more than half of our 400 million global fans are from Asia. Of those 220 million, 75 million are from China alone, 80 million are from Southeast Asia,\u201d Berrada added. Speaking to Caixin, Xu Zhihao revealed the landmark deal had been months in the making \u2013 and was already in place when Xi Jinping met Manchester City players during his state visit to Britain in October. \u201cWe have been talking for a long time,\u201d he was quoted as saying. Confirmation of the move will have been music to president Xi\u2019s ears, as he pushes to turn the Chinese Dragons into a footballing force.

Although there\u2019s no national-level open data initiative, both Chinese citizens and senior leadership are starting to call for greater access to public information.  More countries than ever before are considering the merits of opening up their data \u2013 even those that have been described as politically repressive by human rights organisations.  In March, Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, said government data should be public wherever possible \u201cunless it is relevant to national security and privacy\u201d. This sounds strangely democratic for a country that has a history of cracking down on human rights activists, raising questions over what government data is considered \u201crelevant\u201d in China. Jonathan Gray, director of policy and research at Open Knowledge, says it is important to consider the distinctions between \u201copen data\u201d and \u201copen government\u201d. He says opening up existing data sets is just the first step and doesn\u2019t automatically lead to a democratic government: \u201cPublishing open data is of course not sufficient for open governments or open societies. It is just one ingredient in the mix, and no replacement for other vital elements of democratic societies, like robust access to information laws, whistleblower protections and rules to protect freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of assembly.\u201d Gray adds that it\u2019s not just countries such as China that neglect these democratic elements: \u201cJust look at the recent treatment of whistleblowers and leakers, or concerns around the UK government\u2019s proposals for amending FOI [freedom of information] laws.\u201d A number of groups have sprung up in China to put pressure on the government to increase available data. As well as DJChina (data journalism China) and the UDParty (open data and smart cities) , Open Knowledge China is at the forefront of making open data more widely available.  Feng Gao is one of Open Knowledge China\u2019s ambassadors in Shanghai. With a background in engineering, he\u2019s determined to improve the accessibility of open data in China: \u201cOpen data is so important because it\u2019s the key to modern collaboration, especially if multi-stakeholders are involved.\u201d  He says that if huge social issues are being discussed or debated then open data is the best way to bring every party into the conversation. \u201cIt gives them the right weapon to investigate the issue, stay on the same page, and then come up with a good solution.\u201d China is not the only country starting to put pressure on its government to release data sets. According to the Open Data Institute (ODI), open data is a relatively new and largely untapped resource in Russia. It reports that since December 2014, 2,400 datasets have been made accessible by using Russia\u2019s open data portal, which shares information on education, transport and health.  When looking at Russia, it\u2019s vital to consider Gray\u2019s point: that governments choose which data sets to make available so we can\u2019t necessarily conclude that releasing data is a free, democratic move. However, one organisation \u2013 Clearspending \u2013 is successfully tracking and visualising government spending in Russia. By monitoring more than 12m contracts and 900,000 vendors, the portal has identified more than 4m procurement violations, big news in a country where there\u2019s a tight grasp on government information. When the ODI started working with the government of Burkina Faso, the president didn\u2019t have a strong record of openness. The institute\u2019s Liz Carolan explains how a very small and technically able team of civil servants who understood the social value of openness made economic arguments to get the project off the ground: \u201cThat same team, like many other civil servants, considered themselves citizens first, and were part of the protests that removed the president from leadership. They are now actively working to support the transition to a full democracy, including using their skills to ensure that the results of the forthcoming election are available openly to as many citizens as possible, as quickly as possible.\u201d Carolan says that the biggest challenge when trying to get key stakeholders onboard within the government is to help them understand the benefits of open data. \u201cThis can often mean making a case about the economic potential. It requires addressing people\u2019s fears with clear messages about what open data is, and what it is not.  \u201cOnce you identify who is willing to put their political capital behind an open data initiative, the next challenge is to find the best ways to support them so they can bring about these changes within the system. Open data is primarily a challenge of culture change.

The French and German bourses fell more than 3.5% on Thursday and futures trading points to fresh falls on European markets when markets open again on Friday morning. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was expected to fall 0.6%, and France\u2019s CAC40 and Germany\u2019s DAX to open down 0.8%.        The drama started after the ECB cut its deposit rate deeper into negative territory and extended its asset buying by six months. Its rate cut of 0.10 percentage point, to -0.30%, was smaller than a 0.15 to 0.20 percentage point cut many traders expected.  The central bank did not increase the amount of government bonds it buys while the six-month extension of the programme was perceived as the bare minimum, given traders looked for an extension of one year or even making it an open-ended plan.  Chris Weston of IG in Melbourne said the ECB had \u201cundoubtedly lost some credibility\u201d by failing to deliver a \u201cshock and awe\u201d approach. \u201cWe are left with a market that is now of the belief that we are unlikely to see further easing,\u201d he said.

The euro jumped 3.1% on Thursday to trade at $1.094, its biggest single-day gain since March 2009.        Investors are now turning their attention to the US non-farm payrolls data on Friday, which is likely to cement expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates later this month, barring surprisingly weak readings.  Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, speaking before Congress\u2019 joint economic committee on Thursday, said the United States may be \u201cclose to the point at which we should be raising\u201d rates.  She also said the US economy needs to add fewer than 100,000 jobs a month to cover new entrants to the workforce, perhaps setting an implicit floor for jobs growth that policymakers want to see.  Also attracting investor attention was the OPEC meeting later on Friday. Crude oil prices rose about 3% on the eve of the meeting, as traders hedged their positions.

There are lots of things that can be learned but we must understand the constraints we are working to. A teacher-led style is no silver bullet. I believe the main reason no pupil is left behind in a Shanghai maths class is that each teacher only teaches two lessons a day (the same lesson to two different classes). The rest of their day can be spent marking homework from the previous evening and then helping those that haven\u2019t understood.

The competition didn\u2019t end there, though: once in the kitchen, the boar would be cooked in a myriad ways, all designed to amaze guests. Those days may have long since ended, but the gamey, porcine flavour of wild boar mince makes it a great friend of the spice cupboard; if your butcher can\u2019t get boar (you can hunt it down online at the Wild Meat Company), use free-range pork instead.

Cook for 10-15 minutes, until the apple has collapsed, then adjust the sugar, salt and lemon to taste and put aside to cool. Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6, and line two oven trays with baking paper or foil. Put the star anise in a pestle and mortar, and pound as finely as you can. Add the cumin, grind coarsely, then set aside. Put the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, stir-fry the spice mix for a minute, then add the onion and fry for 10 minutes, until soft and golden. Add the ginger and garlic, fry for a couple of minutes, then stir in the tomato puree, cloves, pepper, chilli, cinnamon and salt, and cook for a few minutes more. Add the mince, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, cook gently for 10 minutes, then leave to cool. Unroll the pastry and peel off two sheets; keep the rest covered under a tea towel until needed, otherwise it will dry out. Brush one sheet with butter, lay the other over the top and cut lengthways into three strips. Make a cone shape with each piece and put a tablespoon and a half of filling inside. Fold the top of the pastry over the open side of the cone, to close it and create a triangle, then brush with butter to seal; cut off any excess. Sprinkle with cumin seeds, lay out on the prepared trays and repeat with the remaining filo and filling. Bake the samosas for 20 minutes, until golden and crisp, and serve on a platter with chutney for dipping. Roast duck fesenjan This was a favourite of 16th-century Mughal emperor Humayan. It\u2019s an opulent and majestic dish that\u2019s best served in a banqueting hall, with goblets of wine and basmati rice; if you don\u2019t have a hall, the Christmas dining table makes a more than adequate substitute. Serves four. 300g walnuts halves 1 duck (about 2kg)1 pomegranate 3 tbsp rapeseed oil 2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 4 tbsp pomegranate molasses 2 tsp honey \u00be tsp black pepper \u00be tsp chilli powder 1 tsp salt 600ml chicken stock  Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the walnuts on a baking tray and roast for five to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to cool, reserve a handful for decorating the duck later, then finely grind the rest in a food processor or spice grinder. Put the duck in an oven tray lined with foil. Quarter the pomegranate and stuff two quarters in the cavity; deseed the other two halves and set aside. Prick the duck\u2019s legs all over with the tip of a sharp knife, season the bird inside and out, and roast for an hour and a half. While the duck is cooking, make the sauce. Put the oil in a frying pan on a low to medium heat, then cook the onions for 15 minutes, until caramelised. Take out a spoonful to decorate the duck with later, then add the garlic to the pan and cook for a couple of minutes. Stir in the ground walnuts, pomegranate molasses, honey, pepper, chilli and salt, add the stock, cook for a couple of minutes until the sauce comes together, then take off the heat. At the end of its cooking time, remove the duck from the oven and spoon out any fat in the tray (save this for roasting potatoes). Pour the sauce over the duck, cover the tray with foil, then return to the oven for a final 30 minutes. Remove and leave to rest for 10 minutes. To serve, pour the sauce on to a high-sided serving platter and place the duck in the centre. Scatter the remaining walnuts, onions and pomegranate seeds on top, and serve with basmati rice and a side salad. \u2022 Meera Sodha\u2019s book, Made In India, is published by Penguin at \u00a320.

Pampukhy with poppy seed and walnut paste      Olia Hercules\u2019 pampukhy with poppy seed and walnut paste: Christmas baubles, Ukrainian style. Photograph: Rita Platts. Food stylist: Frankie Unsworth. Prop stylist: Louie Waller    For me, Christmas is unimaginable without these plump, doughnut-like balls. I love the poppy seed filling, though I have tried them with other nuts with great success, so do experiment with your favourite: pistachios added to the poppy seed paste with a tiny pinch of salt would be fun, for example. You\u2019ll have to judge for yourself how much flour to add: drier dough is easier to shape, but, generally speaking, the wetter the dough, the fluffier the doughnuts. When frying, take it nice and slow, or the middle will be raw. Makes 10-12 doughnuts. 300ml full fat milk50g poppy seeds1 tsp dried yeast1 egg, lightly beaten3 tbsp sugarA pinch of salt50g butter, melted and cooled1 tsp orange blossom water (or the grated zest of 1 orange)500g plain flour (plus extra)50g walnuts, pecans or pistachiosSeeds from 1 vanilla pod, cut in half1 litre vegetable oilIcing sugar, for dusting Heat the milk until almost boiling, measure 50ml into a bowl and soak the poppy seeds in it for an hour. Let the rest of the milk cool to blood temperature, then sprinkle in the yeast and leave for 10 minutes, or until the yeast shows signs of life (when tiny bubbles start to appear). In a bowl, mix the egg, a pinch of salt, a tablespoon of sugar and the butter. Pour in the yeasty milk and orange blossom water, stir to incorporate, then start adding flour little by little: you\u2019re after a soft, pillowy dough. If it\u2019s too wet, knead the dough on a well-floured surface until it stops sticking to your hands too much (a little sticking is fine). Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling-film or a damp tea towel, and leave for an hour, to double in size. Meanwhile, make the filling. Drain the poppy seeds, grind them with the remaining sugar in a mortar, then add the nuts and vanilla, and keep working until you have a paste. When the dough is ready, pinch off 50-70g pieces and roll each into a ball. Flatten each ball in your hand, put half a teaspoon of filling in the centre, then firmly pinch together the sides of the circle, shaping it back into a ball. Put the filled doughnuts on a lightly floured tray, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove again for 30-40 minutes. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. Drop three or four doughnuts into the hot oil at a time \u2013 it doesn\u2019t pay to try more, or the oil will cool down too much. The balls will rise to the top, so turn them with a slotted spoon to ensure they cook evenly. They should take about five minutes, so control the temperature as much as possible (ie, lower the heat if they seem to be catching too soon). Drain the doughnuts on kitchen paper and sift over some icing sugar, then repeat with the remaining dough. \u2022 Olia Hercules\u2019s book, Mamushka, is published by Mitchell Beazley at \u00a325.

Prop stylist: Louie Waller    Italian Christmas Eve is all about the fish, with a whole baked fish as main course or perhaps roast salt cod in a tomato sauce. The pasta, too, will often feature fish, maybe spaghetti with anchovy and tomato or a classic crab linguine. This dish takes the latter up a notch or two by adding squid ink to the mix \u2013 it\u2019s a stunner both to look at and to eat.

Spoon the chorizo into a bowl, add the breadcrumbs to the pan and fry gently, stirring, until they absorb the sausage oil. Tip into the bowl with the chorizo. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and cook the linguine for nine to 11 minutes, until al dente. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in the same saute pan, then add the garlic and chilli, and fry gently without colouring for a minute. Stir in the crabmeat and squid ink, heat through for a minute, then add the wine and let it reduce down. When the pasta is cooked, drain, add to the crab pan and toss to coat the liguine. Scatter over the herbs, lemon juice, zest, chorizo and breadcrumbs, toss again and season to taste. Serve immediately. Strufoli     Angela Hartnett\u2019s strufoli: a Christmas must-have.

Roll each piece into a ball the size of a large marble, and put on a floured tray. When all the strufoli are made, heat the oil in a large, high-sided pan (or deep-fat fryer) to 190C. Cooking them in batches of eight to 10, drop strufoli into the hot oil so they\u2019re half submerged, and cook until they puff up and go golden brown; turn them with a slotted spoon to help them along. Transfer the strufoli to a plate or tray lined with kitchen towel, to drain, and repeat with the remaining dough. You can make them to this stage well ahead of time. In a pan large enough to hold all the strufoli, gently heat the honey, lemon juice and zest until it\u2019s a thin coating consistency, then tip in the strufoli and stir gently to coat all over. Take off the heat and leave to cool in the pan for five minutes, then tip on to a large platter, arrange into a cone shape (or ring, if you prefer) and, while still warm, sprinkle with the nuts and then icing sugar. Serve warm or at room temperature. \u2022 Angela Hartnett is chef/patron of Murano, Cafe Murano and Merchants Tavern, all in London.

The colours \u2013 pristine white fish, scarlet pomegranate and green chilli \u2013 mirror those of Santa and the tree. It\u2019s also very, very easy. A 500g fish will make enough to serve four to six people as a starter or part of a mezze. 1 sea bream (about 500g), filleted and skinned (ask a fishmonger to do this)1 green chilli, deseeded\u00bd lemon2-3 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves pickedSea salt For the dressing1 pomegranate2 tbsp olive oil\u00bd tsp ground cumin\u00bd tsp sea salt Put the fish fillets on a board, and cut into as thin slices as you can; so thin, in fact, that you can see the knife through them (or ask your fishmonger to prepare the fish for you). Lay the slices in a single layer over a large serving plate. Cut the pomegranate in half, squeeze one half over a bowl to release two to three tablespoons of juice (it\u2019s easier than it sounds), then mix in the oil, cumin and salt. Pick the seeds from the other pomegranate half and set aside to use as a garnish. Cut the chilli into very thin slices and put a sliver on each piece of fish. Squeeze the lemon all over the fish, then pour over the dressing, making sure some goes over every slice of fish. Sprinkle on the oregano and a touch of salt, leave for five minutes for the flavours to develop, garnish with pomegranate seeds and serve.

We used to make huge ones at the restaurant, and the whole kitchen would fight over the offcuts, but for home a cake of this size should suffice. Or maybe not. Makes one 23cm cake. For the cake base100g whole hazelnuts25g unsalted butter25g light brown soft sugar\u00bd tsp sea salt1 tsp ground cinnamon200g biscuit (or sweet pastry) crumbs For the filling1 butternut squash, to yield 360g when cooked (or 360g tinned pumpkin puree)375g full-fat cream cheese265g caster sugar1 tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp ground ginger\u00bd tsp ground cardamom3 eggs2 tbsp plain flour150ml soured cream For the topping300ml soured cream50g caster sugarSeeds from \u00bd vanilla pod Heat the oven to 240C/465F/gas mark 9, and line a loose-based 23cm cake tin with baking paper. Cut the squash in half (leave the skin on) and scoop out the seeds. Wrap loosely in foil and roast cut side up for 40-50 minutes, until the flesh is soft. Scoop the flesh into a bowl and mash (for a super-smooth finish, pass through a potato ricer). You can do this up to a day in advance; keep the mash, covered, in the fridge. Turn down the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 5. Roast the hazelnuts on a tray for eight minutes, then rub with a clean tea towel to get rid of some of the papery skins. Crush the nuts to a rough crumb (by hand or in a food processor). Melt the butter in a small pan. Put the nuts and other base ingredients in a bowl, pour in the butter and stir to combine. Tip into the prepared tin and spread to cover the base. Flatten it a little, but don\u2019t compress it too much, then bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. Put the cream cheese, sugar and spices in a mixer with a paddle attachment (or, if making by hand, in a bowl using a large spoon), and work at medium speed to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, making sure each one is incorporated before adding the next, then add the squash puree, flour and soured cream, and mix well. Pour over the base, bake for 25-30 minutes, then remove and rest for 10 minutes. For the topping, mix the cream with the sugar and vanilla seeds until you have a smooth paste. Pour over the top of the baked cheesecake, making sure not to pour it all in one spot, otherwise its weight may make it sink in. Use the back of a spoon or a spatula to spread the mix evenly over the cake, then bake for 10 minutes more. Remove, cool and refrigerate for at least six hours (or overnight) before cutting and eating. \u2022 Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer are chefs/co-owners of Honey &amp; Co, London W1.

FB Malaysia, by Mandy Yin Sesame chicken potsticker dumplings with ginger chilli sauce     Mandy Yin\u2019s satay, laksa and sesame chicken potsticker dumplings: a Malaysian feast. Photograph: Rita Platts. Food stylist: Frankie Unsworth. Prop stylist: Louie Waller    On special occasions, Malaysians serve a range of dishes, rather than one main event \u2013 more south-east Asian meze than roast with all the trimmings. Some of those dishes will invariably feature the kind of stuff we eat every day at hawker markets: these dumplings are inspired by Hainanese chicken rice, a Malaysian staple. With their fragrant filling and crisp bottom, they\u2019re a real crowd-pleaser. The chilli sauce is highly addictive, so make extra: it\u2019s delicious stirred into all sorts, from fried eggs to boiled rice and stir fries. Makes 20, to serve four or five. For the dumplings450g chicken thighs, skinned, boned and roughly chopped4 spring onions, washed and trimmed 2 tbsp soy sauce1 tsp each salt and ground white pepper2 tbsp sesame oil1 eggOne pack fresh Shanghai dumpling wrappers (these are eggless and pure white; from any Chinese supermarket)2 tsp vegetable oil2 tsp unsalted butter80ml water For the ginger chilli sauce2 fresh red chillies, stalks removed, roughly chopped3 cloves garlic, peeled10g peeled ginger1 tsp sugar1 tsp distilled vinegar1 tbsp oil Make the ginger chilli sauce by putting all the ingredients in a food processor and blending until fine. Tip into a small nonstick pan, cook on a medium heat for three minutes, until fragrant, then pour into a small serving bowl and set aside. For the filling, put the chicken, onions, soy, salt, pepper, sesame oil and egg in a food processor and blend to a smooth paste. Working with one wrapper at a time (keep the other wrappers covered to stop them drying out), spoon a tablespoon of the filling into the centre of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water, and bring two opposite points to the centre, pinching along the edges to seal. You should end up with a semi-circle of a dumpling with a flattish base. Put the filled dumpling on a large baking tray sprinkled with corn flour, and cover loosely with a clean damp tea towel, to keep it from drying out. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Heat the vegetable oil and butter in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat. Lay in the dumplings seam side up and cook, uncovered, for three minutes, until the bases are lightly browned. Add 80ml water to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for four minutes, until the liquid has been absorbed and the dumplings have taken on a crisp, lacy crust \u2013 this is what gives them their name. Serve at once with the dipping sauce. Chicken satay Every Malaysian feast worth its salt features satay of some kind: you can make it with prawns, beef, tofu or veg, but chicken is my favourite. If you\u2019re anything like me, you may want to double these quantities, which make enough for six to have two skewers each as part of a spread. 500g chicken thighs, skinned, boned and cut into bite-sized pieces12 wooden skewers, soaked in water For the spice mix1 stalk lemongrass \u2013 only the bottom, white half, roughly chopped2 medium white onions, peeled and roughly chopped5 garlic cloves, peeled 5g coriander powder5g chilli powder5g turmeric powder 2g fennel seeds2g cumin powder63g dark brown sugar13g salt For the peanut sauce187g dry roasted peanuts, finely ground45g spice paste (see method below)600g coconut milk (ideally without emulsifiers)84g dark brown sugar 44g tamarind paste (from Chinese and Asian supermarkets)1g salt2g chilli powder Blend all the spice mix ingredients to a smooth, fine paste. Set aside 45g for the peanut sauce, and put the rest in a large plastic tub. Add the chicken, toss to coat, then put in the fridge to marinade for at least four hours, and ideally overnight. For the peanut sauce, put all the ingredients in a medium saucepan Turn the heat to medium and bring to a boil, stirring now and then to prevent it sticking. Turn the heat to low and simmer for five minutes, until the sauce thickens, then keep warm on a very low heat. (It will also keep in the fridge for up to a week.) Skewer the chicken pieces, and grill on a high heat for 10 minutes, turning halfway through. Transfer to a platter, put the sauce in a bowl, and serve with wedges of cucumber and coriander leaves, to garnish. Laksa  Malaysians tend to save laksa for special occasions because it is time-consuming to make from scratch. If you can find them, laksa leaves (Polygonum odoratum) add a distinctive fragrance to the dish; if you can\u2019t, use fresh coriander instead, which will add both a lovely aroma and a beautiful depth to the broth. Laksa is a great dish for entertaining, because you can prepare everything in advance, and heat the broth just before serving. Serves six. 80g oil24 cooked prawns12 deep-fried tofu puffs, each cut in half (from Chinese food shops)120g green beans, cut into 5cm lengths120g beansprouts400g pack rice vermicelli, soaked in cold water for 10 minutesMint leaves, finely sliced, to garnish For the laksa broth2 400g cans coconut milk (preferably without any emulsifiers)7 tbsp dark brown sugar1.5 litres chicken stock (if homemade, make it a day ahead.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil while you get on with making the broth. In a large saucepan on a medium heat, add 80g oil and the spice paste, and cook, stirring continuously, for 30 minutes, until rich, dark red/brown in colour. Add all the broth ingredients and the chilli and shrimp soaking liquids, bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 30 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove the coriander leaves and lemongrass, and adjust the seasoning to taste. Add the tofu puffs to the broth, so they soak up the flavour, and keep warm. While the broth is simmering, blanch the following in boiling water one after the other: green beans for three minutes, vermicelli for a minute, beansprouts for 30 seconds. Refresh them all in cold water to stop them cooking, and drain well. Portion everything into bowls ready for serving \u2013 some vermicelli, then beansprouts, green beans and prawns. Pour hot broth into each bowl, add four half tofu puffs per serving, garnish with mint and serve. Mandy Yin runs Malaysian street food outfit Sambal Shiok in London.

Food stylist: Frankie Unsworth. Prop stylist: Louie Waller    There can be no Nordic Christmas without gingerbread, and this recipe is my grandma\u2019s. Almost everyone I know bakes at least a couple of batches during December, though most people now buy their dough readymade from the supermarket. This is a pity, because it\u2019s really quite simple to make. These quantities make enough for a typical Nordic gingerbread free-for-all, including plenty left over for building a small gingerbread house. There is no point in making it in smaller quantities, especially if you have Scandinavian friends. Preparation and cooking time: 90 minutes. Resting time: two days. 350g sugar280g golden syrup200ml milk 250g butter, cut into 2cm cubes2 tsp salt1 tbsp ground cloves1 tbsp ground cardamom seeds2 tbsp ground cassia cinnamon1 tbsp ground ginger1 tbsp ground allspice (optional)300g whole blanched almonds and 100g pistachios (optional)1kg soft wheat flour, plus extra to dust1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda (or potash) Combine the sugar, golden syrup and milk in a pan, bring to a boil, then take off the heat and leave to cool a little. Put the butter, salt and spices in a bowl and pour on the still warm (but not hot) milky syrup. Stir until the butter has melted and the mixture has cooled down to room temperature (add the nuts now, if using). Sift the flour and bicarb into the bowl and mix with your hands until fully combined. Shape into a tight lump, wrap in cling-film and put in the fridge to rest for 48 hours. To make gingerbread rounds, unwrap the dough (it will be rather stiff) and divide it into equal-sized workable portions. Roll each piece into a log, then cut it into 3mm slices (or thicker, if you prefer); if you have added nuts to the dough, you will need a really sharp knife to cut it neatly. Alternatively, to make gingerbread shapes, unwrap the rested dough and divide into workable portions. Roll out each portion on a very lightly floured work surface (too much flour will make dough dry), then cut it into the desired shapes with a knife or a cookie cutter (I like to make little pigs). Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6 and line several baking sheets with baking paper. Arrange the gingerbread shapes on the sheets and bake for no longer than five minutes; keep an eye on them, because they burn very easily. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the baking sheets. It doesn\u2019t matter if the gingerbreads are a little bit soft in the middle, because they\u2019ll harden as they cool down. Kn\u00e4ck (Swedish Christmas toffee) Kn\u00e4ck is the Swedish word for \u201cbreak\u201d, so I assume the name of this seasonal toffee refers to its texture. I prefer my kn\u00e4ck a bit chewy, so I cook it for a slightly shorter time than is usual. Kn\u00e4ck is traditionally poured hot into small paper moulds and left to set. For those who make their kn\u00e4ck very sticky in texture, the paper won\u2019t let go of the toffee once it\u2019s cool, so you have to eat the whole thing, paper and all. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, you can test the consistency of the kn\u00e4ck \u2013 and thereby see if it\u2019s cooked to your liking \u2013 by spooning a drop of hot toffee into a cup of cold water: after a few seconds, when it has cooled, you will have a decent indication of the kn\u00e4ck\u2019s final texture. As a general rule of thumb, 122C produces a soft but not sticky toffee, while anything below that will be sticky; 125C will make a firm toffee, and anything above that will produce a hard one. Most Swedes regard kn\u00e4ck as essential over the Christmas period. These quantities will make 45-60 pieces of toffee, depending on how long you boil it and how big your moulds are. 200ml cream170g sugar 280g golden syrup2 tbsp salted butter2 tbsp finely chopped almonds and/or breadcrumbs (optional) Mix all the ingredients except the nuts and/or breadcrumbs in a heavy pan (I use a cast-iron skillet or frying pan). Bring to a simmer on medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon from time to time, and cook until the mix reaches your preferred temperature \u2013 30\u201340 minutes. As soon as the toffee is ready, mix in the almonds and/or breadcrumbs, spoon into moulds and leave to set. \u2022 Magnus Nilsson is chef/owner of Faviken, in J\u00e4rpen, Sweden, and author of The Nordic Cookbook, published by Phaidon at \u00a329.95.

Prop stylist: Louie Waller    Roast meats feature at any Chinese banquet. Usually, that means Peking duck and/or roast suckling pig, but both involve very long, complicated processes that are best left to the experts. This delicious crisp pork, however, is one Chinese roast you can achieve at home. You\u2019ll need to start a day ahead. Serves six. 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda1.3kg free-range pork belly in one piece, bones removed, with a good fat covering2 tsp five-spice salt (simply mix 100g salt with 25g Chinese five-spice powder and 10g white pepper, and store in a jar)1 tbsp condensed milk1 tbsp white-wine (or rice-wine) vinegar Bring a large pan of water with half the bicarb in it to a boil. Drop in the pork joint, turn off the heat and leave to blanch for 30 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, then rub the rest of the bicarb all over the skin. Cut 3mm-deep scores into the flesh side. With a needle, stab the skin all over \u2013 the more pin-pricks you make, the crisper your pork will be \u2013 then rub five-spice salt into the flesh side. In a bowl, combine 200ml water and the condensed milk and vinegar. Brush this solution all over the pork skin, then hang the belly in the fridge overnight, to dry out (this may involve clearing out the fridge; use a butcher\u2019s hook, if you have one, but one of those hooks for hanging utensils will do). Alternatively, hang the pork in a cool place and leave to dry with a fan pushing cold air over it. Take out all the oven racks except the top one, and put a tray in the base, then heat it to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Hang the pork on its hook from the top oven rack and roast for 25 minutes. Turn up the heat to 210C/410F/gas mark 6\u00bd and roast for 20 minutes more. Remove from the oven \u2013 there will be black patches on the skin, but don\u2019t worry: this is good. Using a small knife, scrape off the char to reveal the crisp skin beneath. Cut the pork into bite-sized chunks and serve at once, just as it is, or with plain rice, perhaps some greens cooked in ginger and garlic, and some chilli sauce for dipping.

It\u2019s also ridiculously easy. Don\u2019t try making it with fillets: fish always tastes better cooked on the bone, and there\u2019s less time and mess involved in the prepping.

On a plate that will fit inside your steamer basket, make a bed of the remaining ginger and onion. Lay the fish on top, and steam on a high heat for 15 minutes (or until the internal temperature of the fish reaches 60C), then transfer the fish and veg to a warmed platter. Heat the oil in a wok and, when it starts to smoke, pour over the fish: this will crisp up the skin.

Divide the pastry into four. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one piece of pastry to 2mm thick. Using a 10cm round cutter (or a small glass), cut out 10 circles and transfer to a lined baking sheet. Put a tablespoon of filling in the centre of each circle; don\u2019t overfill. Roll out and cut another piece of pastry as before, and use the circles to cover the filling. Using the tines of a fork, crimp the edges of the pastries.

Greg Wallace \u2013 who was once described by Michael Gove, the former education secretary, as one of his \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d academy superheads \u2013 agreed to stand down from a government advisory board when approached by education officials after this news-paper alerted them to his track record on Friday. The former head was dismissed as leader of five schools in Hackney, east London, last year following an investigation into financial irregularities involving contracts given by his academy group to his partner. Wallace is due to appear soon before a disciplinary hearing ordered by the National College for Teaching and Leadership. Despite his track record, both the Harris Federation of academies, founded by the Conservative party donor Lord Harris, and the government had subsequently appointed Wallace as an adviser. More than 24 hours after the Department for Education was approached with the revelations, a spokesman confirmed that he had vacated his post in response. \u201cMr Wallace is no longer a member of the maths working group run by the Department for Education and the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Maths,\u201d he said. Gareth Thomas, a Labour MP and former teacher, said ministers had urgent questions to answer. \u201cThis is extra- ordinary. The Department for Education and Nicky Morgan need to be extremely careful about who they appoint as advisers,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cIt is important that teachers and schools have complete confidence in the department and all those who are guiding its policies.\u201d Alasdair Smith, national secretary of the Anti-Academies Alliance, said: \u201cIt really beggars belief that the DfE could take on Greg Wallace, given his history. Either it has not done due diligence on his case, or it has done due diligence but doesn\u2019t care about what happened in the past because of his enthusiasm for teaching maths in a way which suits the DfE\u2019s ideology. \u201cHe is a headteacher who seems to have been sacked by his local authority and, before being re-employed, he needs to answer that case.\u201d Smith added: \u201cThis shows how the normal forms of accountability which used to operate under local authorities have been discarded under the academies scheme. Local authorities have been criticised, but one of the things they would do would be to ensure that people could not just escape from past misdemeanours and go and work for another school.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Harris Federation said that Wallace had been hired on a part-time basis. \u201cWhen we recruited Greg Wallace in summer 2014 he had not been referred to the NCTL,\u201d she added. Wallace has been a key advocate of a system for teaching mathematics in primary schools called \u201cEffective Maths\u201d, which is modelled on teaching used in Shanghai. He was appointed to an unpaid role on the Department for Education maths advisory board apparently without basic checks having been carried out. In 2012, in a speech to the Association of School and College Leaders, Gove said Wallace was one of the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d academy leaders running outstanding schools in deprived areas. However, two years later Wallace was dismissed by Hackney council following an investigation into the awarding of lucrative school computer contracts \u2013 believed to be worth in excess of \u00a31m \u2013 to C2 Technology, which was owned by Wallace\u2019s partner, Tony Zangoura. In an email to staff at the Best Start Federation of academies at the time, Zangoura said that he and Wallace had not been together in 2009 when the first contract was awarded. He accused the Hackney Learning Trust, a private company managing local education services, of \u201cgoing on a fishing expedition within the schools to find dirt\u201d. However, Wallace, 45, was subsequently dismissed by the council and the NCTL has appointed the solicitors Browne Jacobson LLP to present the case at a professional misconduct hearing, a date for which has yet to be set. After being dismissed as executive head of the academies, Wallace launched a campaign to expose the spending practices of the HLT. His subsequent revelations, discovered through Freedom of Information Act requests, included that members of the board had stayed for two days at the Royal Automobile Club complex at Woodcote Park, a 17th-century stately home in Surrey.", "tags": ["Nicky Morgan", "Academies", "Schools", "Education", "Teaching", "Michael Gove", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2015-12-06T00:05:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/08/commodities-rout-deepens-as-chinese-trade-data-signal-weaker-demand", "sentences": ["The Nikkei index in Japan was down almost 1% on Tuesday and the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng indices were down more 0.9% and 1.6% respectively."], "title": "Commodities rout deepens as Chinese trade data signal weaker demand", "article": "The accelerating rout in commodity prices has piled pressure on energy and resources shares in Asia Pacific amid more signs of slowing demand from China.

Data showed on Tuesday that China\u2019s exports fell by a more-than-expected 6.8% in November from a year earlier, their fifth straight month of decline. Imports fell 8.7%, which was not as much as expected but enough to signal continued weak demand from the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Analysts were unsure if the numbers signalled a possible improvement in Chinese domestic demand, which has been a key factor in driving world commodity prices to multi-year lows.  \u201cThe big picture hasn\u2019t really changed that much. The US is doing okay, but the problems with emerging markets are really quite big,\u201d said Kevin Lai, chief economist Asia Ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.  \u201cImports have been slumping for more than a year now, so the year-on-year figures are benefiting from a much lower base, which statistically we should expect.

Opec\u2019s decision to keep production at near-record levels in an oversupplied market has spooked investors grappling with reduced demand from China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer. The decline in oil has spilled over into other industrial commodities with iron ore continuing its fall below the $40 per tonne barrier to $38.90. Copper steadied its slump thanks to the slightly better China import numbers but nickel and aluminium prices were weaker.  Underlining the cautious outlook for China, a Reuters poll of Japanese firms showed deep pessimism about near-term Chinese growth prospects, with 79% saying they do not expect to expand business there next year. Japan\u2019s Nikkei had earlier bucked the trend ojn other markets, rising 0.3% before turning lower on the day, after revised data showed Japan had dodged a recession in the third quarter, with GDP up an annualised 1%, compared to a preliminary reading of a 0.8% fall.       Australia, whose three biggest exports are iron ore, coal and natural gas, felt the pain sharply in its large resource sectors.  BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, who along with the Brazilian company Vale, dominate the iron ore trade to China, were sold. BHP, which is also listed in the UK, fell more than 5% to a fresh 10-year low of $17.05. Rio was off more than 4%.  \u201cThe selling has really turned up and the energy and materials sectors are getting slammed,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at trading firm CMC Markets.

The western companies subcontract anti-counterfeiting work to private investigators paid on commission. More seizures mean higher fees, creating powerful incentives to cheat in an industry with little oversight. As counterfeiting has flourished in China over decades, a lucrative, parallel industry has blossomed to fight it. Counterfeiting today is a multibillion-dollar business in China, which produces nearly nine of every 10 fake items seized at US borders. One of the world\u2019s largest consumer goods companies hired an investigator to track down counterfeit anti-dandruff shampoo in China, the AP said. But instead of finding real counterfeiters, the investigator, Wang Yunming, set up a factory to produce counterfeit shampoo himself, which he then \u201cseized\u201d and billed to the firm as a successful raid, according to two employees involved in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. Wang was convicted of fraud and is due to be released from prison in 2023, according to a copy of a judgment from Hefei intermediate people\u2019s court in China\u2019s Anhui province. The AP said it found instances where western firms paid investigators who were themselves manufacturing or selling counterfeit versions of their clients\u2019 own goods; investigators who colluded with factories to make counterfeit goods they could \u201cseize\u201d and present to their western bosses for payment; and investigators doctoring documents, fabricating raids that never took place.

There is no action, just promises. As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned.\u201d The talks, intended to reach a new global deal on cutting carbon emissions beyond 2020, have spent much time and energy on two major issues: whether the world should aim to contain the temperature rise to 1.5C or 2C above preindustrial levels, and how much funding should be doled out by wealthy countries to developing nations that risk being swamped by rising seas and bashed by escalating extreme weather events. But, according to Hansen, the international jamboree is pointless unless greenhouse gas emissions are taxed across the board. He argues that only this will force down emissions quickly enough to avoid the worst ravages of climate change.           Paris talks overlooking immediate threats, say climate change activists    Hansen, 74, has just returned from Paris where he again called for a price to be placed on each tonne of carbon from major emitters (he\u2019s suggested a \u201cfee\u201d \u2013 because \u201ctaxes scare people off\u201d \u2013 of $15 a tonne that would rise $10 a year and bring in $600bn in the US alone). There aren\u2019t many takers, even among \u201cbig green\u201d as Hansen labels environment groups. Hansen has been a nagging yet respected voice on climate change since he shot to prominence in the summer of 1988. The Nasa scientists, who had been analyzing changes in the Earth\u2019s climate since the 1970s, told a congressional committee that something called the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d where heat-trapped gases are released into the atmosphere was causing global warming with a 99% certainty. A New York Times report of the 1988 testimony includes the radical suggestion that there should be a \u201csharp reduction in the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide\u201d, a plea familiar to those who have watched politicians who have traipsed up to the lectern or interviewer\u2019s microphone in Paris over the past two weeks. After that, things started to get a little difficult for Hansen. He claims the White House altered subsequent testimony, given in 1989, and that Nasa appointed a media overseer who vetted what he said to the press. They held practice press conferences where any suggestion that fossil fuels be reduced was considered political and unscientific, and therefore should not be uttered. \u201cScientists are trained to be objective,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be prevented for talking about the the implications of science.\u201d He retired from Nasa in 2013. \u201cThat was a source of friction. I held on longer than I wanted, by a year or two. I was in my 70s, it was time for someone else to take over. Now I feel a lot better.\u201d     A man rides his bicycle on yellow paint poured on the street during a protest by activists from environmental group Greenpeace on the Champs-Elysee in Paris. Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP    From being possibly America\u2019s most celebrated scientist, Hansen is now probably its most prominent climate activist. He\u2019s been arrested several times in protests outside the White House over mining and the controversial Keystone pipeline extension. He is also an adjunct professor at Columbia University. When he\u2019s in New York, he lives near the campus, surrounded by books piled on groaning shelves. Hansen\u2019s not slowing down \u2013 he\u2019s involved in a climate lobbying group and still undertakes the sort of scientific endeavor which helps maintain his gravitas. One particular paper, released in July, painted a particularly bleak future for just about anyone living near the coast. Hansen and 16 colleagues found that Earth\u2019s huge ice sheets, such as those found in Greenland, are melting faster than expected, meaning that even the 2C warming limit is \u201chighly dangerous\u201d. The sea level could soon be up to five meters higher than it is today by the latter part of this century, unless greenhouse gases aren\u2019t radically slashed, the paper states. This would inundate many of the world\u2019s cities, including London, New York, Miami and Shanghai.  \u201cMore than half of the world\u2019s cities of the world are at risk,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cIf you talk to glaciologists privately they will tell you they are very concerned we are locking in much more significant sea level rises than the ice sheet models are telling us.  \u201cThe economic cost of a business as usual approach to emissions is incalculable. It will become questionable whether global governance will break down. You\u2019re talking about hundreds of million of climate refugees from places such as Pakistan and China. We just can\u2019t let that happen. Civilization was set up and developed with a stable, constant coastline.\u201d The paper has yet to be fully peer reviewed and some of Hansen\u2019s colleagues, including his protege at Nasa, Gavin Schmidt, have voiced their doubts whether sea level rise will be quite this bad, with the IPCC projecting up to a meter by 2100.  Brickbats are thrown in a bipartisan way. Hansen feels Obama, who has made climate change a legacy issue in his final year in office, has botched the opportunity to tackle the issue.   Related: COP21 environmental photography exhibition \u2013 in pictures    \u201cWe all foolishly had such high hopes for Obama, to articulate things, to be like Roosevelt and have fireside chats to explain to the public why we need to have a rising fee on carbon in order to move to clean energy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut he\u2019s not particularly good at that. He didn\u2019t make it a priority and now it\u2019s too late for him.\u201d Hansen is just as scathing of leading Republicans who have embraced climate science denialism to the chagrin of some party elders.  Leading presidential candidates Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson have all derided evidence that the world is warming due to human activity while Ted Cruz, another contender, has taken time out from his campaign to to sit on an inquiry into climate science that has heard testimony from a rightwing radio host who has no scientific background.  \u201cIt\u2019s all embarrassing really,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cAfter a while you realise as a scientist that politicians don\u2019t act rationally.  \u201cMany of the conservatives know climate change is not a hoax. But those running for president are hamstrung by the fact they think they can\u2019t get the nomination if they say this is an issue. They wouldn\u2019t get money from the fossil fuel industry.\u201d There is a positive note to end on, however. Global emissions have somewhat stalled and Hansen believes China, the world\u2019s largest emitter, will now step up to provide the leadership lacking from the US. A submerged Fifth Avenue and deadly heatwaves aren\u2019t an inevitability. \u201cI think we will get there because China is rational,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cTheir leaders are mostly trained in engineering and such things, they don\u2019t deny climate change and they have a huge incentive, which is air pollution. It\u2019s so bad in their cities they need to move to clean energies. They realise it\u2019s not a hoax. But they will need co-operation.\u201d           Protesters mark red lines in Paris climate demo     This article was amended on 14 December 2015 to clarify that Hansen believes taxes on greenhouse gas emissions are essential to the Paris climate talks.

Small island countries \u2013 like Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands \u2013 but also the Philippines have been pressing since the failed Copenhagen conference of 2009 for negotiations to adopt 1.5C as the goal of climate negotiations. According to climate science, the tougher standard would give those lands a better chance of surviving rising seas, which threaten to flood their cities and drown the crops, and fuel dangerous storm surges. Even with a 1.5C temperature limit, there are no guarantees. It is a question of odds. But before the Paris meeting the coalition of vulnerable countries took on a new slogan: \u201c1.5 to stay alive.\u201d That applies to the Seychelles, too. Nearly two-thirds of the 115-island country are uninhabited coral islands. \u201cWe would lose all of them, but that\u2019s not the important part,\u201d said Jumeau. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of islands slipping under. People think it\u2019s a very simple story, but we would become a failed state. Our economy would collapse,\u201d he said. Jumeau, speaking just moments after the French hosts made a passionate plea to the climate meeting to seize the historic moment and sign the agreement, ticked off the dangers to Seychelles without drastic action. \u201cAbout 80% of the population, 80% of economic activity is in the coastal area, which is flat. We would lose our airport, which is our number one industry, tourism. We would lose our fishing port, which is our number two industry. We would lose our capital. We would lose all our power stations. We would lose all our schools, which are on the coast. All of our hotels are on the coast,\u201d he said. Yes, it was true that people would still have room to retreat inland. \u201cWhat can we do sitting on mountains? We can\u2019t feed ourselves.\u201d Unlike rich countries, the Seychelles did not have the capacity to invest in the infrastructure that would give it a better chance against the seas. The country was already heavily in debt \u2013 and the costs of shoring up reefs as natural storm barriers, installing early storm warning systems and building evacuation shelters and sea walls would run into many billions. Then again, Jumeau argued, some of the world\u2019s richest cities were also finding themselves in a similar predicament \u2013 and could benefit from the higher 1.5C goal the island states had demanded. \u201cI live on Manhattan.

Related: Markets in fragile mood as Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates    China\u2019s decision to loosen its grip on the yuan and allow slow but steady depreciation in recent weeks has added to concerns that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy may be more fragile than expected.  The move, which followed an announcement on Friday of a shift towards a trade-weighted basis instead of exclusively tracking the US dollar, will also heighten concerns that China is prepared to intensify a currency war with rival regional economies in order to keep its huge export sector competitive. More encouraging Chinese economic data released over the weekend did little to improve the mood on stock markets as the backdrop of a shakeout in commodities markets and fitful global growth continued to drag on confidence on Monday.

In addition, Suncorp, the insurance company, issued a profit warning on concerns about mounting payouts for weather-related claims, building costs and the weaker Australian dollar. The mainland Chines emarkets provided a rare bright spot, with the Shanghai Composite up 0.54% at the lunch break.  European futures trading pointed to more falls on Monday morning. The FTSE100 was expected to open 22 points lower at 5,930 points, while the Dax in Germany was seen opening 18 points down at 10,322. Much of the glut in oil which has been concerning investors in recent weeks can be attributed to excess supply rather than weakening demand, analysts said. But the focus was turning on Monday Asia to whether markets will be able to withstand a US rate hike, which is excepted to be announced after the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy review on Wednesday evening US time. \u201cIf the Fed hikes a rate as expected, people are watching whether recently sold assets such as US shares, oil and the dollar will rebound,\u201d said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.  \u201cIf they rebound, the market will likely be stabilised, but if not, we have to prepare for another sell-off.\u201d  For now, investors looked past better-than-expected Chinese indicators released over the weekend. Data on Saturday showed factory output growth in China accelerated to a five-month high in November, while retail sales rose at an annual 11.2 percent pace - the strongest this year.  On Friday, the Dow sank 1.8% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.9%, as falling crude prices added to investor nervousness before an expected first U.S. interest rate hike in nearly a decade.  \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that equities are going to be truly tested over the coming four days, and the Fed will be a catalyst for volatility in the lead up to Thursday,\u201d wrote Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne.

When I feel like I\u2019m experiencing opera overload, Tom is a nice escape \u2026 What, in your opinion, is the best new piece written in the past 50 years? I saw John Adams conduct his piece Harmonielehre. It is very interesting to watch a composer with their own piece. I love how he uses the orchestra to create a soundscape that is, at the same time, inviting as well as challenging to his audience. It is very filmic \u2013 the experience of hearing it live is immersive and expansive.         Listen to audio of John Adams\u2019 1985 composition Harmonielehre    We\u2019re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why? I would visit Mozart because his music has been the biggest challenge for me to sing. It is so understated, and yet there is so much nuance in the music and language that to sing it how he intended would be the most wonderful joy. Also, everyone talks so much about the \u201cMozart voice\u201d \u2013 it would be amazing to hear the voices that were performing his music in the first place in order to understand what is truly meant by that in a historical sense. Is applauding between movements acceptable? Applauding between movements is not ideal. There is nothing quite like being in an audience of captivated people \u2013 applause between movements can break that magic. Having said that, there is also nothing quite like being in an audience discovering that music, perhaps for the first time, and feeling moved to applaud spontaneously.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert? The Barbican centre recently held a festival called Sound Unbound (I also performed in it). The artists were encouraged to engage directly with their audience about what they were performing during the festival. This gave the audience an insight into why and how that piece of music was particularly meaningful to the artist. I think this helps the audience appreciate the repertoire from a new perspective, having heard from someone who has spent a lot of time working out how they will perform this music.  What do you sing in the shower? I warm up in the shower, so it\u2019s usually scales and boring technical things. Do you enjoy musicals? If so, do you have a favourite? I do \u2026 I love Sondheim! I think he is a genius of his idiom. There are so many of his pieces that I like \u2013 but I think Company is probably my favourite. What\u2019s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? Wow, that is a big question. I find really special things in almost everything I\u2019m fortunate to see live. I adored Emanuel Ax when I saw him with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. I thought he was a wonderful example of an artist at a stage in his career when artistry is the true focus. He never worried about the notes on the page, the keys under his fingers \u2013 it was just the music.         Watch Emanuel Ax rehearsing Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto No 14 in July 2015 in Shanghai    Which non-classical musician would you love to work with? Wynton Marsalis \u2013 his instrument is like an extension of him, and his musicality is incredible. He would be a great artist to collaborate with. Imagine you\u2019re a festival director in London, with unlimited resources. What would you programme for your opening event? Earlier this year I heard Brett Dean\u2019s orchestral arrangement of Debussy songs for voice and piano with the Australian World Orchestra. I love seeing pieces done in different ways. To commission arrangements of piano and voice pieces would be great fun. It\u2019s late, you\u2019ve had a few beers, you\u2019re in a karaoke bar. What do you choose to sing?

Giving evidence to a Senate committee in Canberra, the secretary of the defence department, Dennis Richardson, said talk about the threat posed by Landbridge, which has alleged ties to the Chinese political and military elite, was not based on facts.  However, he conceded it had been an oversight not to inform the US before the announcement, which caused an awkward moment for the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, when he was asked by the American president, Barack Obama, at the Apec summit in November why the US government had not been told about the deal.  And while Richardson took full responsibility for the slight, he suggested it was the job of the US embassy to keep its government updated.   Related: Chinese company secures 99-year lease of Darwin port in $506m deal    The Senate standing committee on economics, which is examining the foreign investment review process following the controversial 99-year lease of the port of Darwin to Chinese firm Landbridge, had earlier heard from Peter Jennings, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi). Jennings, who stressed he was giving his personal opinions, suggested Chinese control of the port and other infrastructure across northern Australia would assist Beijing\u2019s strategic and diplomatic presence in the Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThere is a deep Chinese driving interest in terms of understanding how western military forces operate,\u201d he said. \u201cRight down to the fine details in terms of how a ship operates, how it is loaded and unloaded, the types of signals a ship will emit through a variety of sensors and systems, the noise it makes as it moves through the water with its propellers. \u201cThese are all points of information which are of deep interest to China and something they actively seek to gather in a range of means, both overt and covert.\u201d  Richardson rejected the assertion, saying \u201cno Australian or American naval vessel I\u2019m aware of enters a commercial port, whether it be New York, Sydney, Shanghai, or Darwin, without turning off key emitters. The notion that you enter a commercial port \u2013 regardless of the operator \u2013 and you leave yourself exposed to possible collection is absurd.\u201d Other Aspi commentary about Chinese ambitions in the area was \u201calarmist nonsense\u201d, he said. \u201cThe notion that Landbridge\u2019s lease in Darwin somehow or other is part of a broader strategic play by China, and this gives the PLA Navy access to Darwin, is simply absurd. It does not. It is not factually based.\u201d Jennings had called for the Australian government to strengthen the national security review of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) and extend it to cover state and territory assets, after the $506m Darwin deal revealed \u201cloopholes\u201d in legislation. Under Commonwealth legislation, there was no requirement that the privatisation go through the board, although it did examine the deal initially owing to some confusion. Jennings said it was beside the point the FIRB had been contacted and that there was a lack of clarity around the role played by defence and other security agencies in the process. \u201cI think that points to the need for a stronger national security test to be applied to foreign investment review processes,\u201d he said. He suggested there had not been sufficient due diligence in examining the lease, and said he was concerned at the 99-year term. Richardson denied the department had failed to do its due diligence in assessing the deal. \u201cWe\u2019re paid to look at proposals hard-headedly ... and unemotionally and to provide rational advice,\u201d he said in his opening statement.   Related: Malcolm Turnbull shrugs off US concern over Darwin port lease to Chinese firm    \u201cIn respect of the port of Darwin, which is the subject of most discussion, any claim that we did not exercise due diligence is based upon ignorance, not on fact.\u201d He said the issue of privatisation was first raised in early 2014, and in May this year the department signed \u201cthe most extensive deed of licence we have with any port in Australia precisely because the port of Darwin, as others have indicated, is strategically important\u201d. Richardson said he was happy to answer questions on the deed but declined to provide the document, even in confidence, to the committee.  He said that in July 2015, the defence department was asked specifically by the Treasury to assess Landbridge as a potential bidder for the port, since the Treasury believed the Landbridge investment would require FIRB approval. It became clear in September it was not required. \u201cWe advised Treasury after specifically looking at the Landbridge arrangement that we did not have an objection to it,\u201d Richardson said. When he learned of the Northern Territory government\u2019s announcement that Landbridge had won the contract, he called the defence department to confirm they had no issue with it.  However after reading \u201ca string of criticism\u201d and commentary from Aspi and others in the weeks following, he requested the director of the defence intelligence organisation \u201cbring together people from other intelligence agencies to go over this again and see if we had missed anything, specifically from espionage and other perspectives\u201d. \u201cThe written advice I received on that was there was no significant implications and it was fine,\u201d Richardson said. Any Chinese national working at the Darwin port would need a security clearance and a visa, he said. \u201cSo you do your due diligence in that context.\u201d Duncan Lewis, the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), later told the hearing the agency was not precluded from giving advice on any security risk with the Darwin port simply because the Firb process had stopped.  He said Asio was engaged \u201cthroughout the process\u201d giving advice to Treasury and Defence. \u201cWe examined all of the aspects of security that we consider to be important and came to a view that the transaction as proposed could go ahead with the two deeds\u2026 and various mitigations,\u201d he said. Lewis stressed the examination by the intelligence agencies was thorough and complete but would provide no details on the manner, substance or sources of the investigation. Xenophon suggested Lewis was essentially saying \u201ctrust us, we\u2019re from Asio\u201d, to which Lewis said \u201cunfortunately\u201d yes. Speaking outside the hearing, Xenophon told media the evidence from the inquiry and the lack of specific information from Lewis indicated the current foreign investment review process was \u201cas clear as the silt at the bottom of the port of Darwin\u201d. He called for urgent reform and noted the instruction from the prime minister and treasurer to look at the whole framework. \u201cThere is no way the Americans or indeed the Chinese would allow this sort of deal to go through with the level of scrutiny that it went through,\u201d he said. On Tuesday afternoon Anne Tan, acting NT government coordinator-general and Port of Darwin project lead, defended the transaction and said \u201ccomprehensive and extensive due diligence consistent with established precedents on other similar transaction was undertaken on all bidding parties\u201d. She conceded they did not inform the commonwealth specifically about the due dilligence processes they were undertaking with the bidders shortlist. It was assumed the federal departments were making their own enquiries. \u201cWe were comfortable that the links between Landbridge and the Chinese government were acceptable to us,\u201d said Tran. \u201cIt is quite normal \u2013 and happens here in Australia as well \u2013 for business leaders in the community to be involved in strategic and policy think tanks and government forums, and our investigations revealed that was the role Landbridge played.\u201d Michael Hughes, the director of Landbridge\u2019s Australian operations, said the company engaged early with both Firb and the defence department, first meeting with Firb in June 2015. He said the company did not have an armed militia, and said Landbridge\u2019s chairman Ye Cheng was not a member of the Communist party or the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cAny of my discussions with Mr Ye have certainly not indicated any influence or direction that seems to come from anything other than a commercial driver,\u201d he said.

The Freedom Principle: Experiments in Art and Music, 1965 to NowMuseum of Contemporary Art, Chicago Spirits rejoice! At the start of this year, after a debacle by a certain Icelandic popstar in a certain modern art museum, you might have thought that the art world just couldn\u2019t come to terms with music, and that the enduring relationship between visuals and sounds was too tough to communicate in our antiseptic white cubes. And then, this summer, the MCA Chicago blasted an alarum of saxophones and trumpets \u2013 in the form of this historic achievement in exhibition making, which wedded contemporary art and jazz into a newer, pluckier history. What a show this was: buoyant, democratic, intricate and very, very loud. Curators Naomi Beckwith and Dieter Roelstraete \u2013 both specialists in art rather than music \u2013 began by commending the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, a free jazz collective founded in 1965 on the South Side of Chicago. Their disordered, unbounded compositions and improvisations, not to mention their wild multimedia performances complete with face paint, conceived of music as a model for black collective action: music offered freedom, yes, but it offered unity, too. \u201cWhat time is it? Nation time!\u201d begins one of the era\u2019s best records, by Joe McPhee \u2013 but this music was so much more than politics with a beat.

Stan Douglas, Hors-champs, 1992. Photograph: MCA Chicago    That double focus held throughout the exhibition, which placed musical materials from the 1960s and \u201970s alongside work by contemporary artists looking to the legacy of free jazz. Self-playing musical instruments, crafted by both the late Terry Adkins and the young Lili Raynaud-Dewar, echoed the AACM\u2019s early experimental percussion rigs.

In one of the greatest artworks of the past 30 years, Stan Douglas\u2019s two-sided video Hors-Champs (1992), we see trombonist George Lewis and saxophonist Douglas R Ewart in Paris, spinning La Marseillaise into a freeform dirge of independence and exile. I have seen Douglas\u2019s video a dozen times before, but never did I imagine I would see it alongside works by the very musicians Douglas filmed \u2013 right there, in the too often exclusionary spaces of a contemporary art museum, Ewart and Lewis had created their own kinetic installation, with chimes and rainsticks clattering away. No distinction between artists and musicians: it\u2019s all one exuberant effort. Turn the volume up. 2.

And remember that name, because there is not an artist alive who approaches the biggest questions \u2013 the transience of life, man\u2019s relationship to animals, the border between sense and insanity \u2013 with the sensitivity and grace of this Thai master. Her first American retrospective, serene and ghostly, was the best solo show of the year, and saw Rasdjarmrearnsook softly and sympathetically lecture a classroom of corpses: only the most literal sign of a realm where death is not the end. 3.

The Kongo show, resplendently capped with 15 of the world\u2019s 20 surviving nail-studded power figures, did away once and for all with the bigoted falsehood of \u201ctribal\u201d art, and inscribed raffia weavings, carved ivory staffs, and severely featured masks in a 500-year history of authority, trade, slavery and colonialism. The Maurice show, no less significantly, explored the German veneration of an African saint in the 16th century. Cranach painted Maurice as a matinee idol, with gleaming armour and beautiful black skin. 4.

Whitney had to wait too many decades for his first New York museum show, and his imbalanced grids of seething color \u2013 majestic green, opulent purple, blazing orange, honking goldenrod \u2013 not only recalibrated the history of American abstract painting, in which black artists have been too often sidelined \u2013 it also showed a youth-besotted art world the virtues of late style: Whitney\u2019s dancing, thrumming grids of the last three years are the best paintings of his career. 6.

Gay, gorgeous and richer than God \u2013 in the 20s he spent a million francs to build a house on wheels, with Lacoste upholstery \u2013 Roussel wrote surreal and wild prose that inspired not only Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell, but contemporary artists who found a funny kind of freedom in his speculative nonsense.  7.

With only 19 sculptures made over 19 years, this uncompromising retrospective of super-realistic fiberglass and steel sculptures \u2013 of a wrecked car, a boy and a frog, or the artist himself on horseback \u2013 presented Ray as a Praxiteles with a 3D scanner. Its highlight: the double nude Huck and Jim, an epochal work of art of Twain\u2019s heroes that the Whitney Museum of American Art, in an act of cowardice, refused to place outside its new home. 8.

Self-help memes overlap with terrorist incitements in Steyerl\u2019s high-tech but low-finish videos and lectures, and the supposedly autonomous art world is not exempt.

Her narratives of ambitious and faded cultural projects \u2013 a Nasserite ballet school, a pan-Arab women\u2019s magazine, a resort on the Beirut corniche \u2013 are crucibles where promises of a better future bump up against the cold reality of capital and war. 10.

Several prominent WNBA players decried the remarks, among them Elena Delle Donne of the Chicago Sky, who was voted the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player last season. \u201cWomen were not put on this earth just for men to look at,\u201d Delle Donne wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are people. We have a purpose. We are role models. I am an athlete first and foremost.\u201d Ivory Latta, a two-time All-Star point guard with the Washington Mystics, called Arenas a non-factor desperate to remain in the limelight. \u201c[He] clearly wants y\u2019all attention,\u201d Latta tweeted. \u201cSo y\u2019all please entertain that BeanPie looking dude. He\u2019s not even worth our time.\u201d  Connecticut Sun forward Camille Little took a different approach, tweeting photos of her feminine figure \u201c4 all the ppl who think ... the players look like men\u201d. Arenas, who last played in the NBA in 2012 before a one-year stint with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association, averged 20.7 points in 11 seasons with the Golden State Warriors, Washington Wizards and Memphis Grizzlies. He missed nearly all of the 2009-10 season due to a locker-room conflagration over a gambling debt that saw handguns drawn, an episode that effectively derailed both his career and a Wizards club then on the rise. Suddenly, Sepp Blatter\u2019s ideas on boosting the popularity of women\u2019s soccer, which courted the same ugly stereotype about female athletes, appear tactful. In 2004, the then-president of Fifa suggested that more revealing uniforms would \u201cpromote a more female aesthetic\u201d and raise the popularity of women\u2019s soccer. \u201cLet the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball,\u201d Blatter said. \u201cThey could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men - such as playing with a lighter ball.

China is AstraZeneca\u2019s second-biggest market by sales after the US, and one of its fastest growing areas. Britain\u2019s second-largest pharmaceutical company has struck a strategic alliance with Chinese biologics firm WuXi AppTec to produce innovative biological drugs (proteins or living cells that are derived from human or animal genes) in the country. AstraZeneca has the option to acquire WuXi AppTec\u2019s biologics factory in Wuxi City for $100m (\u00a366m) and will invest $50m to build another site alongside it.  The alliance builds on a joint venture between the two companies to develop and sell MEDI5117, a biological treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, in China. AstraZeneca plans further investments totalling hundreds of millions of dollars developing and making drugs in China over the next few years. Its China headquarters are in Shanghai and it now employs more than 11,000 people in the country, after entering in 1993. It has factories in Wuxi and Taizhou and an innovation centre in Shanghai, which is focused on developing treatments tailored to Asian patients. AstraZeneca\u2019s push into China comes despite the country\u2019s economic slowdown, which has affected the pharmaceutical market, through restrictions on the use of antibacterial drugs at hospitals and stricter control on health insurance payouts. At the same time, Beijing\u2019s crackdown on corruption led to a damaging scandal and a record 3bn yuan (\u00a3312m) fine for rival British firm GlaxoSmithKline.  Separately, AstraZeneca has agreed to buy Takeda\u2019s core respiratory division for $575m, which will give it the global rights to a key lung drug, sold as Daliresp in the US and Daxas in other countries, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. AstraZeneca has been marketing the drug in the US since buying those rights early this year. The latest deals come after a string of other acquisitions and alliances, along with disposals, aimed at helping AstraZeneca return to sales growth in 2017 and meet its long-term ambitious sales targets.

Related: Fed interest rate hike: shares surge as markets celebrate  - business live    The Dax in Frankfurt rose 1.9% while the CAC in Paris rallied 2.3% and the Ibex in Madrid was up 2% in early European trading. This is partly because the euro lost ground against the US dollar, providing a boost to eurozone exporters. Investors were cheered by Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s pledge to raise borrowing costs only gradually. \u201cChristmas has come early\u201d for stock markets, said Robert Craig, private client investment manager at MB Capital. Yellen\u2019s promise came \u201cas a blessed relief to anxious stockwatchers\u201d, he said. \u201cWith the Dow rising steadily from the moment she first opened her mouth, the rosy picture she painted of the US economy and the absence of major overseas threats has sent markets surging with relief.\u201d Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, told Reuters: \u201cWith the Fed out of the way and only a couple of trading sessions left before Christmas, we could now see a traditional year-end rally. The new year will once again prove to be quite volatile as markets will start to anticipate the next rate hike.\u201d Stock markets across the Asia Pacific region also rallied, with the Nikkei index in Japan closing up 1.6% while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.5%. In China, the main Shanghai Composite index finished 1.8% higher and the smaller Shenzhen Composite gained 2.7%. The Australian stock market ended the day 1.5% higher. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cAn interest rate rise is a new experience for much of Wall Street. A whole generation of traders have never known anything but the post-crisis world of ultra-low interest rates and, for the most part, rising asset prices. An estimated two-thirds of traders have never seen a full Fed tightening cycle.\u201d Governments and central bankers breathed a sigh of relief when stock markets rallied following the rate rise, which had been widely expected. The South Korean vice-finance minister Joo Hyung-hwan said: \u201cIt is a relief that even despite the Fed rate hike, turbulence in global financial markets has not been large.\u201d The Fed raised the target range for its fed funds rate by 25 basis points, to between 0.25% and 0.50%, the first increase since 2006.  Its rate-setting committee said there had been \u201cconsiderable improvement\u201d in labour market conditions this year and added that it was now \u201creasonably confident\u201d that inflation would climb back to the 2% target in the medium term. It made clear that the increase was the tentative start of a \u201cgradual\u201d series of hikes and that it would closely monitor inflation. Financial markets suggest that the next hike, to 0.75%, might not come until June. Although the decision by Yellen and her colleagues provided greater certainty for markets, there was some concern about the longer-term impact of the rate rise. The move pushed up the dollar, raising questions about whether investors would pour money into higher-yielding US debt at the expense of emerging economies. Copper fell 0.9% to $4,569 (\u00a33,062) a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. Hong Kong\u2019s top central banker, who was obliged to immediately match the Fed\u2019s hike under the Chinese-run territory\u2019s peg to the US dollar, said he expected only a modest outflow of capital as a result of the Fed\u2019s move, but added that outflows would depend on the pace of US rate hikes and the interest rate differential between the US dollar and Hong Kong dollar. The fall in the price of oil, which has weighed on markets for several weeks, continued on Friday. Brent crude slipped 0.3% to $37.27, while New York light crude edged down 0.2% to $35.46. Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics, noted: \u201cConfounding the expectations of many, the Fed did little to take the sting out of that hike by significantly lowering its projections for the pace of future rate hikes. Looking at the new projections, there was surprisingly little change.

Stock markets seem to like it so far. But it may also spell the end for the biggest boom in mergers and acquisitions the world has ever seen. If it does, we should all be worried. Maybe it really might be different this time? The phrase is probably one of the most overused in the world of finance. And yet, bankers, lawyers and corporate CEOs are all praying that this year\u2019s tsunami of merger and acquisition deals has a lot of force left in it \u2013 and above all, that it won\u2019t end in bloodshed and tears, as the last two big M&amp;A booms have done.  There are a lot of reasons for Wall Street to remain resolutely upbeat, and to ignore what history suggests is about to happen next. Goldman Sachs alone advised its clients on $1.5trn of merger deals in the first 11 months of 2015. That, says Mergermarket, is the first time that any bank or other institution has joined the \u201c$1.5tn club\u201d. The announcement early this month of the $130bn mega-merger of chemicals behemoths Dow and DuPont will make Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom the first law firm ever to advise clients on deals worth more than $1trn.   Indeed, this year has been a windfall for everyone serving the thousands of businesses that have succumbed to M&amp;A mania, from giants like Pfizer, Dell and Anheuser Busch InBev, to smaller businesses like Keurig Green Mountain or China\u2019s Shanghai STO Express Co. As of early December, Wall Street dealmakers were on pace to sign $4.7trn in mergers and acquisitions and that figure might even exceed $5trn.   But while the fees on all those deals \u2013 or at least, the portion of them that actually are completed as planned \u2013 continue to flow into bankers\u2019 accounts and show up in bonus checks into 2016, whether or not the M&amp;A frenzy itself will extend into the new year is one of the most hotly-contested topics on Wall Street these days.  And it matters to you, because to some extent, the willingness of acquirers to pay hefty premiums for companies like Broadcom or EMC has helped to support the stock market at relatively high valuations. Knowing that eager acquirers are scouring the market, looking for businesses or divisions of larger companies to buy, and being aware that any buyer would need to pay a premium over recent market prices, investors have taken comfort in the idea that this potential buying interest provides a \u201cfloor\u201d of sorts for stock prices. If the M&amp;A market dries up suddenly, that support could evaporate, and stocks could become more volatile and vulnerable to big selloffs.  Indeed, historically, big flurries of M&amp;A activity have served as harbingers of tough times for financial markets. The last two glory periods for M&amp;A bankers and lawyers came in 2006 and 2007, and before that, in 1999 and 2000. And many of us can remember just what came next, and just how nasty it was: the market selloff and the recession of 2001/2002, and the financial crisis of 2008, rapidly followed by yet another recession.   The argument made by those who suggest that we\u2019re in for a repeat is that in order to deliver the kind of growth that analysts and activist investors demand, companies have no choice but to turn to acquisitions. Indeed, acquisitions have supplanted all other sources of growth: the rate of growth in capital spending has diminished to vanishing point. In the face of lackluster or flat revenue growth, CEOs have cut costs so aggressively that there is hardly an extra penny left to be saved in order to make the bottom line look more attractive to investors.   But while M&amp;A can look like a cure-all for those woes to a CEO who is under pressure, that CEO is playing defense. Given the choice between investing in a company that has an organic, strategic source of growth and one that is turning to acquisitions as a way to fuel future profitability, investors almost always are better off with the former.   That\u2019s the logic that underpins the prediction by doomsayers that the current bout of M&amp;A mania tell us that we\u2019re about to run headlong into yet another economic recession. Of course, correlation is not causation. Nonetheless, quite a bit of logic underpins their anxiety. For some years now, analysts who track the pattern of earnings and revenue growth in US corporations have been fretting about the lack of organic earnings power, and the fact that businesses in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 index seemed to rely on their ability to pare costs to the bone to meet analysts\u2019 earnings growth forecasts. That simply isn\u2019t sustainable.  Then, too, there is the fact that the ability to complete mergers relies on the existence of both stronger equity markets and cheap and accessible debt financing. The former still exists \u2013 although this year\u2019s stock market performance is far from being as robust as that of the last few years. But the debt market is likely to begin becoming more jittery as it digests the Federal Reserve\u2019s first hike in key short term lending rates in nearly a decade \u2013 a move that will make borrowing at least slightly more costly.  More M&amp;A dealmaking is only going to increase qualms on the parts of investors, and might make you more wary of funds that own a lot of either investment grade or junk bonds. Bond fund managers already have been fretting about \u201cM&amp;A risk\u201d, noting that existing bonds of companies involved in dealmaking, like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries or Anheuser-Busch InBev, have seen their prices decline after transactions were announced. Loading up the balance sheet with more debt isn\u2019t something that investors \u2013 or rating agencies \u2013 tend to welcome.  Then, too, the market needs to absorb a lot of new issuance in order to finance all this M&amp;A activity \u2013 and do so at a time when the junk bond market is heading for its first annual losses since 2008, and a major mutual fund has barred investors from being able to redeem their holdings. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who this autumn publicly warned that M&amp;A dealmaking is reaching excessive levels, last week described the junk bond market as a \u201ckeg of dynamite that sooner or later will blow up\u201d. It\u2019s also the market that a reasonably large proportion of acquirers will have to use to raise funds to underwrite their purchases. If you study this wave of M&amp;A activity closely, however, you\u2019ll find some contrasts with previous bouts of merger madness that have ended in disaster for the economy, however. That\u2019s enough to give me at least some hope that history won\u2019t repeat itself, note for note, this time around.  Back in 2006 and 2007, private equity accounted for a larger proportion of the M&amp;A deals being struck, buying 20% to 25% of the companies. They don\u2019t purchase businesses for strategic reasons \u2013 because they believe that the newly-acquired entity will help them penetrate new markets, operate more efficiently or develop new products. Their goal is purely financial: to streamline the business and sell it at a profit. What private equity funds do may tell us something about valuations, but it doesn\u2019t say much about the health of corporate America, about their outlook or confidence in the future, or their strategic vision. If anything, they tend to be vulture investors, snapping up assets at rock bottom valuations in periods of distress at the bottom of a market cycle.  So, are corporations overly confident? That would be a real risk, if it\u2019s true. Thus far, however, market participants have said they see CEOs and chief financial officers being intent on retaining their credit rating (and not being willing to load up the company with debt just to complete a merger) and being willing to walk away rather than overpay or do a deal that is outside their comfort zone.  And the pressure will remain on those CEOs to keep the deal machine whirring as long as possible. \u201cShareholder activism seems to have a much bigger voice now than it did in the past,\u201d says Neil Dhar, a partner in PwC\u2019s deals practice in New York, who sees many reasons why the M&amp;A bull run should be extended well into 2016. Former competitors \u2013 like DuPont and Dow \u2013 want to combine forces in order to dominate the market. Dell and EMC decided to merge to better exploit their customers\u2019 interest in cloud computing. Companies that don\u2019t transform will become obsolete, and mergers are a key part of that evolution, Dhar argues.  Indeed, the biggest challenge might turn out to be not whether we end up seeing a broad economic recession, but whether all these M&amp;A bulls stampeding down the street stumble and collapse at the magnitude of the challenge they have set themselves. After all, experts cite that mergers fail to achieve their desired goals \u2013 improved earnings, lower costs, or moves into new markets \u2013 at a distressingly high rate of anywhere from 65% to 90%.

I would like to say that she is famous for her droll and highly eccentric musings in venues as disparate as the Roundhouse, Tate Britain and Richmond ice rink, but this would be an overstatement. For those who love her utter strangeness \u2013 going about as an angel, forcing her large frame into a dainty tutu to deliver monologues on femininity, delivering a kind of anti-circus show with a live horse \u2013 she has always been a star to follow. But her performances down the decades (she was born in 1950) have been so ephemeral \u2013 often improvised, always short-lived \u2013 that most of us have very little experience of her work first hand. It is therefore a treat to have some sense of what English has made caught by the tail and held still in one place for some months at Camden Arts Centre. Although there are no live performances, alas, there is at least a strong presentiment of the artist\u2019s thoughts at work. The largest and most impressive of the three galleries at Camden devoted to her latest projects is the first. It is a characteristically odd hybrid of an installation: a film without motion, an opera without visible singers, a narrative emerging in brief fragments, pencilled on sheets of paper on the walls. It ought to be arduous, but it is instead compelling. The gallery is pitch black, except for fine beams picking out these pages along the walls, which amount to a kind of deconstructed scrapbook.    Films show acrobats spinning plates on poles, but also balancing glasses, vases and even whirling carpets on their feet    On each spread is an image opposite some words. Here is a black-and-white photograph of a Chinese acrobat balancing a saucer on the tip of a long lariat of a pole, curving through the air like the letter C, her accomplishment stupendous. \u201cFlagrant Wisdom\u201d is printed opposite \u2013 the title of the image, one supposes; but underneath this phrase, English has written another in pencil, \u201cbrave the day\u201d, as if she was talking to us as well as the acrobat. Already there is a sense of public spectacle and theatrical aside, and of private voices in the head. Now there are more Chinese acrobats balancing columns of glasses on their chins; images of molten glass being blown; photographs of electrical luminescence and lightning being generated in laboratory conditions. The accompanying phrases resonate every time \u2013 \u201cdelicate persuasion\u201d, \u201clittle falter\u201d, \u201cthe pleasure of the possible\u201d, \u201chighly wrought\u201d.     \u2018Mesmerisingly slow, practised and serene\u2019: a still from Ornamental Happiness. Photograph: Alastair Muir    And around you, as you make your way through the darkness, is the sound of 10 voices singing some of these phrases against a strongly beautiful set of harmonies written by Luke Stoneham. Repeated, circling, plunging, and again repeated, they amount to angelic incantations. Precisely the relationship between idea, image, word and sound is impossible to pin down, because it varies so much between one page and the next. But it has at least something to do with feats of balance \u2013 the acrobat, apparently keeping still, and keeping steady, even as he or she is in constant subtle motion; the human voice, sustaining its note, yet ever vibrating; the glass, transparent as air, absolutely rigid and yet still a form of liquid that is permanently on the verge of shattering. One of the most mysterious photographs here shows a glass afflicted by \u201ccrizzling\u201d, an inherent fault in the chemical composition of the original formula that causes certain salts to leach out of the object. The glass appears to be weeping. Everything is itself and yet metaphorical at the same time: the music echoes the images, which seem like complex ideograms translated, or extended, by the words.

Films of Shanghai acrobats show them spinning plates on poles, but also balancing glasses, vases and even whirling carpets on their feet, while the objects they were using \u2013 exquisite Venetian glass, German ceramics \u2013 are shown in all their fragility alongside. Some of these performances were filmed at the National Glass Centre in Sunderland, with objects specially blown for the occasion, including a massive glass bubble that becomes a heavy vase, which is in turn tossed upon an acrobat\u2019s head as if it were as weightless as a bubble. We should take our burdens so lightly\u2026 The most staggering spectacle is a performance filmed at the 2006 Liverpool Biennial in which a young woman, lying on her front, carries trayfuls of champagne glasses in pyramids on the soles of her feet, the palms of her hands and her forehead. Her body becomes a tree, a candelabra, a catastrophe on the brink. You can hardly bear to look, and yet the performance is mesmerisingly slow, practised and serene. It is the agony and the ecstasy, like the sounds of the opera drifting through the galleries. Every element of this show is part of a plan for an immense performance project, conceived by Rose English a decade ago, which has never yet come to fruition. But perhaps it never can, or even should. The truth of life\u2019s fragility, the bravery of the human heart, and the song of the body electric flow all the way through it. Everything you see and hear is as lightly borne as that bubble and yet profound: wisdom raised to the level of vision. \u2022 At Camden Arts Centre, London until 6 March", "tags": ["Performance art", "Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2015-12-20T08:00:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/23/monster-city-urban-fairytale-saskia-sassen", "sentences": ["One day, a visitor arrived from a faraway city in China \u2013 Shanghai, on the Yangtze River.", "And in a very grave voice, he told the people of London a tale of strange happenings in Shanghai.", "Shanghai had exploded into what looked like fireworks of buildings: all different, but all tall and grand.", "They were mostly poor, but still, life was not too bad in Shanghai.\u201d The visitor continued: \u201cIt all changed when the destructions began.", "\u201cFrom a distance,\u201d said the man, \u201cif you did not know that this had happened to so many of us, Shanghai looked beautiful and very impressive, with all those tall towers.", "But we, the people of Shanghai\u2019s neighbourhoods, knew the other side of the story.\u201d     \u2018It was as if a monster had crawled into the city.\u2019 Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    The visitor\u2019s tale had familiar elements for the people of London, too."], "title": "'A monster crawls into the city' \u2013 an urban fairytale by Saskia Sassen", "article": "Once upon a time, a very long time ago, a settlement was born by a river, and they called it something unpronounceable. When the Romans came, they called it Londinium. Kings and queens and dukes and other powerhouses flocked to this city by the river. Across the decades and the centuries, all these powerful kings and queens and dukes \u2013 and ever-bigger companies and banks and funds \u2013 rose and fell. They are all dead now. But the city where they lived is still alive, after 2,000 years of moving through history; looking forward with the will to live. And a legend arose that what kept the city alive through good times and bad was not the palaces but the neighbourhoods or the boroughs, as the old name has it. Most of the people in the city were not rich or powerful but they were good at making neighbourhoods \u2013 with lots of small shops, churches, theatres, and craftspeople working in metal and wood and many other materials.     \u2018And one day, a grand visitor arrived.\u2019 Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    There was also a high street in each of these neighbourhoods. They weren\u2019t high really, but they gave you a high \u2013 all those little shops and pubs; all those people going in and out. Each neighbourhood was different, but together they made a sort of urban tissue, a bit like coral reef. One day, a visitor arrived from a faraway city in China \u2013 Shanghai, on the Yangtze River. He spent a lot of time answering questions about how to pronounce Yangtze. He looked very grand. And in a very grave voice, he told the people of London a tale of strange happenings in Shanghai. At first these happenings sounded enchanting, magical. Shanghai had exploded into what looked like fireworks of buildings: all different, but all tall and grand. Then, however, it became a little scary: \u201cWe had lived for a very long time in dense, lively neighbourhoods. They were mostly poor, but still, life was not too bad in Shanghai.\u201d The visitor continued: \u201cIt all changed when the destructions began. Some of our neighbourhoods were flattened with huge machines. \u2018Why?\u2019 we asked. We found out the hard way. It was to make room for more and more very tall buildings. As this went on, it meant that many of us had to leave our homes and neighbourhoods: millions of us were pushed to the faraway edges of the city.  \u201cFrom a distance,\u201d said the man, \u201cif you did not know that this had happened to so many of us, Shanghai looked beautiful and very impressive, with all those tall towers. But we, the people of Shanghai\u2019s neighbourhoods, knew the other side of the story.\u201d     \u2018It was as if a monster had crawled into the city.\u2019 Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    The visitor\u2019s tale had familiar elements for the people of London, too. It had been fun to see some tall buildings go up, even if it meant destroying a few neighbourhoods. But the destructions had escalated, and the city began to feel very alien. In time, the people heard that the same thing was happening in other cities too. They were all beginning to look the same with their tall, identikit buildings. It was as if a monster had crawled into each city and was chomping away at it. Chomp, chomp, chomp. \u201cYou cannot have a city without neighbourhoods,\u201d the people said. \u201cThat is where most of us live and shop and go to school.\u201d Yet the monster carried on eating neighbourhoods to make room for its tall towers, making a weird kind of tissue for which the people did not quite have a name. The monster called it \u201curban\u201d. This tissue wasn\u2019t at all like the tissue of the neighbourhoods or even the old city centre. It was killing the people\u2019s houses and small shops and little streets and squares. This was a bad time \u2013 there were not enough places to live any more. And as the monster kept coughing out tall towers everywhere, everywhere became nowhere.         \u2018And the city was dragged down by all those tall towers.\u2019 Video: Hilary Koob-Sassen    The people understood that the monster\u2019s power was fed by liquid gold. It could go anywhere and set up a tower, even in the middle of an old neighbourhood where nobody had asked it to come. They were always anxious about where the hungry monster would appear next. The city, however, was not about to go down without a fight. After all, it had survived many a bad period across the centuries, and was still alive \u2013 unlike those kings and queens and powerful companies of old. The neighbourhoods could see they had to get together and fight this monster. After all, they were the city ...      \u2018A dome of solar energy cells.\u2019 Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    Then, one night, a child whose family had been thrown out of their little house in the neighbourhood had a dream. Perhaps it was a vision, or maybe it had been on the television news. The child, who was called Copernica, saw that what the monster had done in London was happening in many other cities \u2013 including some the child only knew from schoolbooks: New York, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, San Francisco. Her dream was turning into a nightmare. There was the monster, with its teeth wrapped around the child\u2019s own bedroom window. But what happened next was almost funny. A little, unhappy voice came out of the monster, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got nowhere else to go with my liquid gold, but it is still growing and growing. It is meant to shine in the sun, not just sit there in dark pools inside towers.\u201d     The monster\u2019s plans? Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    Now the child was no longer scared: she knew from the school playground that complainers were rarely fighters. What happened next was strange. \u201cDo you have any advice for me?\u201d asked the voice. \u201cI am really used to having advisers, but now nobody wants to touch me with a barge pole \u2026 they do not want to deal with me because I give them a bad name.\u201d The child did not understand all these words, especially \u201cadviser\u201d, but sensed this was an opening, a chance for something to change. But it had to be now, as the monster might snap out of this mood and become dangerous again at any moment. But no ideas were coming into the child\u2019s mind.      Copernica\u2019s watch. Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    Then she remembered a recent geography lesson at school \u2013 on deserts, and how we have the technologies to gather solar power in vast quantities. \u201cI can show you how to flow your liquid gold into the Sahara!\u201d she told the monster. \u201cYou are rich enough to cover thousands of miles of desert with a dome of solar-energy cells. And below them could be garden cities containing many houses for people in need.\u201d The child got very excited at the possibilities, even if it did mean using the nasty monster\u2019s liquid gold. For its part, the monster looked a bit puzzled. \u201cWait!\u201d it cried. \u201cHow will I grow if I spread myself thin on the desert?\u201d But the child reassured it: \u201cEvery solar cell you lay down will produce a golden coin that you can use to build more.\u201d  And so the monster poured down from its towering dark pools, heading straight for the Sahara. And the people were delighted at the prospect of a solar lifeline spreading out across the desert, forming a new generation of \u201coasis cities\u201d that could welcome people from every background \u2013 not merely tourists, businessmen and multi-millionaires.     Happy new year! Illustration: Hilary Koob-Sassen    Suddenly, the child woke with a start. A feeling of dread spread over her like the monster\u2019s tissue. Of course it was not going to use its liquid gold for the good of the people; it could only think of itself. \u201cThis monster is simply going to build another jungle of tall towers in the Sahara,\u201d she cried, \u201cand call it a smart city ...\u201d Saskia Sassen is Robert S Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University and co-chairs its Committee on Global Thought.

His train hunting mission \u2013 which he officially launched in 2005 \u2013 has coincided with one of the most spectacular bursts of railway construction in history; an immense engineering project that some compare to the 19th-century railway boom that helped make the US the world\u2019s leading economy. In 2006, the year after Wang\u2019s expedition began, China opened the highest railway line on Earth, finally fulfilling Mao Zedong\u2019s dream of integrating Tibet with central and eastern China.

Since that pre-Olympic push began, China has built the world\u2019s longest and fastest high-speed rail routes, using sleek white bullet trains to slash the distances between mega-cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. In just over seven years, about 11,800 miles (19,000km) of high-speed track \u2013 about 55% of the global total \u2013 has been laid. \u201cWhat the world did in half-a-century, we have done in 10 years,\u201d said Zhao Jian, a transport expert from Jiaotong University in Beijing.

The furious pace of the expansion has raised red flags, including misgivings over safety in the wake of a deadly 2011 high-speed rail crash near the city of Wenzhou. The disaster, which claimed 40 lives, exposed a web of corruption at the heart of the country\u2019s railways ministry, which was officially disbanded in 2013.

Photograph: James Wasserman for the Guardian    Zhao, a long-term critic of China\u2019s high-speed push, said there were also doubts over the financial viability of many projects. Building such connections between major cities such as Beijing or Shanghai made sense but doing so in China\u2019s less densely populated interior was financial madness. \u201cIt is like building a 160-floor hotel where only 27 floors make a profit and the rest suffer serious losses,\u201d he said. Wang, who has photographed seven of China\u2019s eight key high-speed \u201carteries\u201d, describes high-speed rail as a \u201cgreat invention\u201d that had profoundly changed the lives of millions of Chinese citizens. \u201cIn the past, if I wanted to go to Shanghai that would mean spending a whole night on a train unless I took the plane. Now, it\u2019s only a couple hours by train. It has certainly made it easier for me to travel from A to B,\u201d he says. But Wang admits his soft-spot is for China\u2019s old-fashioned fleet of trains, of which some Mao-era models are facing extinction. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sad to see the old stations and rail lines being demolished. I\u2019m quite a nostalgic person and I like old things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s inevitable as time goes by. The only thing I can do is to document the changes in an artistic way.\u201d    Related: Journey into the 1950s: travelling by steam to Chinese town that time forgot    Wang\u2019s travels have given him a first-class seat to witness his fast changing homeland.

With a stacked supporting cast \u2013 including Neil Morrissey as his fitness freak dad and Greg Davies as a party-hearty uncle \u2013 it\u2019s a carefully calibrated extension of the successful Howard brand, and even features his real-life sibling Kerry as Dan\u2019s glam younger sis, Julie.

As part of its broadcast of every single episode of OFAH, Gold takes us back to these very early episodes, which show hints of a series that would more than find its feet in the decades to come; plots involve the sale of a job lot of one-legged turkeys and young Rodney harbouring ambitions to work in Hong Kong.

Like a wedding reception without a ceremony, it\u2019s a show where musicians, often in costume, perform familiar tunes to elderly couples drinking sparkling wine. Over the last 15 years or so, it has become a huge concern \u2013 and among the biggest performers is Rieu, a Dutch violinist with flowing hair who plays waltzes. Each year, he performs in his home town of Maastricht, and this is a record of his 2015 show, featuring his own Johann Strauss orchestra.

In August, it looked as if the world was heading towards another global meltdown; but it hasn\u2019t been that way yet. The recent rise in US interest rates signalled that the world\u2019s biggest economy might at last be coming out of the doldrums following the crash in 2008, but the repercussions for other countries and financial markets globally are unclear. China crisis For all the worries about Greece and the eurozone, in the end concerns about the volatility of Chinese markets rocked global sentiment most during 2015, after the Shanghai composite index started falling dramatically, first in June, and then later in August. On one tumultuous day in August the Chinese market fell 8.5%, its largest one-day drop since 2007, hitting share prices around the world, including the FTSE (down 2.8% to 6012 on the day), as investors feared that China\u2019s economy was fast running out of steam. Given the anxiety provoked by those sharp share price falls in China during August, it is perhaps something of a surprise that the Shanghai index is closing the year with a gain of 13%, even though it is around 30% down from its 2015 peak in June. And despite the return to something approaching normality since August, worries about China continue to unsettle sentiment and markets. In one of the last trading statements of the year in London, the stockbroking group Panmure Gordon cited the crisis in China as one factor in its flow of deals drying up. The City stockbroker is by no means the only business to have suffered headwinds from the fear that the world\u2019s second-largest economy might no longer be travelling at full steam. Dozens of companies, including the UK luxurywear group Burberry, Japan\u2019s Kobe Steel, logistics group TNT and the Danish shipping firm Maersk, also blamed China\u2019s woes for hitting their profits. Oil\u2019s going down The price of Brent crude, which was $116 a barrel in June 2014, dropped below $50 at the beginning of the year and has shown no signs of recovering. By the end of the year, the price of Brent crude touched 11-year lows of $36.05. Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has cut its oil price forecast for next year by $10, from $53 to $43 a barrel, due to continued high levels of supply that may be heightened by the lifting of sanctions against Iran and the US removing its export ban. For West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, Moody\u2019s cut the forecast to $40 a barrel from $48. The low price of oil has helped to reduce the rate of inflation in many of the leading economies and theoretically frees up demand for other goods. But the sharply lower price has also changed the economics for energy firms, putting Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s \u00a335bn-\u00a340bn takeover of BG in jeopardy. Year of the swissie Switzerland\u2019s central bank rarely raises its head above its snowy parapet, but early in January 2015 it caused an unprecedented shock when it unexpectedly abandoned a ceiling put in place three years earlier against the euro. So out of character was the move that the normally discreet Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said she found it \u201ca bit surprising\u201d that she had not been informed. European central bankers were equally surprised. The euro immediately fell against the Swiss currency by 13.8%. The ceiling was introduced in 2011 after the eurozone debt crisis saw investors piling into safer havens, such as Swiss assets. The fallout from its sudden removal proved too much for some. Alpari, the foreign exchange broker, collapsed as a consequence of this and many of its clients being short of Swiss francs; and IG Index, a spread-better, said it was owed \u00a315m by a group of clients caught out by the sudden rise in the Swiss currency. Swiss finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf recently said she did not expect the central bank to impose a new currency cap for the strong Swiss franc any time soon.     AB InBev, which brews Stella Artois, made a $117bn bid for SABMiller. Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters    The year of getting it together A number of companies felt that 2015 was the right time to make a strategic move. Even Warren Buffett, the veteran US entrepreneur, chose to make 2015 the year of his largest-ever deal, a $32bn bid for American Castparts. Global takeover deals, mainly originating from the US or the far east, broke records in terms of value, taking the total value of deals to $4.6 trillion in early December. According to data from Dealogic, there have been nine deals worth more than $50bn (\u00a333bn) in 2015, five more than in 2014. There was less activity in the UK, though London lay claim to two of the top four deals globally: Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s $117bn bid for SABMiller and Shell\u2019s $50bn tilt at BG. US bankers seem to have taken the view that this was a good time to proceed with deals after two or three years of companies showing signs of strengthening after the financial crisis of 2008. Low interest rates contributed to determination to do a deal at a time when financing it might be more manageable. Greece The crisis in Greece during the first part of the year always threatened to create an unfolding of the eurozone and consequent volatility in global financial markets. But by the middle of August, as the country signed up to its third bailout plan, the pressure eased. As the deal was signed after exhausting meetings, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said: \u201cThe past six months have been difficult. We have looked into the abyss. But today the message of today\u2019s Eurogroup is loud and clear: on this basis, Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the euro area.\u201d On that the jury is still out.", "tags": ["Stock markets", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Chinese economy", "Eurozone crisis", "2015 in review", "China", "Banking", "European banks", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2015-12-27T09:00:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/china-arts-the-white-haired-girl-film-revolutionary-opera-mao-zedong", "sentences": ["Alongside the 3D film, a stage revival of the opera is also under way, with about 30,000 people reportedly taking in performances in Guangzhou, Changsha, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing since November."], "title": "China heralds new tone for the arts with 3D film of revolutionary opera", "article": "Critics hailed it as \u201can art classic in a new era\u201d, while China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, called it \u201ca visual feast of blowing wind, snowy mountains, pitch-dark night and thunderous storms\u201d. This was not the Beijing debut of China\u2019s latest pop sensation, but a 3D, big screen revival of a Mao Zedong-era revolutionary opera called The White Haired Girl. The film\u2019s boxing day premiere marks the latest chapter in an attempt by the president, Xi Jinping, to stamp his mark on the Chinese arts. \u201cContemporary arts must ... take patriotism as a theme, leading the people to establish and maintain correct views of history, nationality, statehood and culture,\u201d the general secretary of the Communist party told a forum in 2014, at which he set out his vision for Chinese painters, playwrights and novelists. The White Haired Girl, first performed in 1945 at the Communist party\u2019s headquarters in Yan\u2019an, fits Xi\u2019s bill perfectly. The opera, said to be among Mao\u2019s favourites, charts the trials and tribulations of a peasant girl called Xi\u2019er whose father, an impoverished farmer, is forced to sell her to an unscrupulous landowner. Enslaved against her will, the she flees into the mountains, taking shelter in a cave where hardship turns her hair white. Eventually, Xi\u2019er is rescued by gallant members of the Communist party\u2019s Eighth Route Army. Her hair then returns to its normal colour. In one of many effusive, government-backed reviews of the remake, the critic Hu Yifeng heaped praise on \u201ca timeless tale showcasing the national spirit\u201d. \u201cWhite Haired Girl has eternal value,\u201d Hu wrote. Alongside the 3D film, a stage revival of the opera is also under way, with about 30,000 people reportedly taking in performances in Guangzhou, Changsha, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing since November. Chinese media has not shied away from the political significance of the rebirth of revolutionary opera. A culture ministry official told state media that the phenomenon was directly linked to \u201cthe artistic development plan of the party, the future of China\u2019s art and who art should really serve\u201d. Xinhua said: \u201cThe 3D opera embodies the spirit of remarks by Xi Jinping ... on socialist literature and art, emphasising the people-oriented concept in the production of artistic works.\u201d Underscoring the president\u2019s ties to the project, China\u2019s first lady, the soprano Peng Liyuan, \u201ctook time off her busy schedule to look over the play and provided valuable advice for its modification\u201d, Xinhua added. Her husband\u2019s blueprint for the arts has sent shivers down the spines of many artists and writers, who fear the determination to focus only on the positive and the patriotic spells doom for their trade.  Chen Xiwo, an author whose books are banned in China, said in a recent interview: \u201cOf course the rulers want people to focus on the positive side, but if writers go along with this, they are not true writers. \u201cIf writers from a certain country write nothing about the problems of their country then that country\u2019s literary works will be of no value.\u201d Sheng Keyi, a celebrated novelist, said it was difficult to predict what impact Xi\u2019s attempts to rein in the arts would have. \u201cThe Stalin era was very repressive and yet brilliant writers and pieces of writing emerged from that era,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are two sides to every coin.\u201d Lei Jia, who plays Xi\u2019er in the reborn opera, told the China Youth Daily newspaper its focus on ordinary lives would \u201ctouch people, no matter what generation they are from\u201d. Hou Keming, the film\u2019s director, told the state broadcaster CCTV his use of 3D technology had transformed revolutionary opera. \u201cYou feel like you are right in front of the actors and actresses,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel like you are on the stage.\u201d But Qiao Mu, a media studies professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said a film with such a \u201cstrong ideological hue\u201d would almost certainly flop in 21st-century China. \u201cThis opera is not about entertainment. Perhaps a few old people might go to remember their sufferings in the olden days,\u201d he said. Foreign audiences are also unlikely to find themselves captivated by the production, which features songs such as Longing for the Rising Red Sun in the East and Dear Chairman Mao. Henry Kissinger sat through a performance of The White Haired Girl during a 1971 visit to China before the historic rapprochement between Washington and Beijing in 1972.  He later recalled having witnessed \u201can art form of truly stupefying boredom\u201d.

On Tuesday, Fairfax published an interview with education minister Simon Birmingham in which he said that the government would not be funding the crucial final two years of the six-year Gonski program \u2013 the two years that would see the full benefit of funding delivered where it was needed most. Later in the day, Malcolm Turnbull backed away from the story, saying \u201cthis is not a time for a political stoush about this\u201d and that his government was \u201cabsolutely committed to ensuring that all Australian kids get a great education, whatever school they go to\u201d.   Related: 52,000 students and 1,050 classrooms: inside the world's largest school    Turnbull notably did not use the name of his old friend David Gonski, architect of the widely applauded review into education funding that in December 2011 recommended a six-year funding template that would see resources flow to children most in need. Needs-based, sector-blind funding that would ensure that all Australian kids would indeed get a great education, whatever school they go to. Birmingham, too, later seemed to back off from his own interview. In a statement, he said \u201cnothing has changed in relation to the Turnbull government\u2019s policy on schools funding\u201d. Earlier, in the interview in which he categorically said the final two years of funding would not happen, he also said: \u201cI want a school funding system that is genuinely needs-based and is targeting the money where it\u2019s most required.\u201d Well, yes. This was the prime recommendation of the Gonski review in the first place, to direct money to those children who need it most: children from low socio-economic backgrounds, children with disabilities, Indigenous children, children in poor rural areas. The more layers of disadvantage, the more funding to be received. As Gonski wrote in the report in December 2011, the proposed funding arrangements of the review \u2013 the full six years \u2013 would be \u201crequired to drive improved outcomes for all Australian students, and to ensure that differences in educational outcomes are not the result of differences in wealth, income, power or possessions\u201d. Everyone is singing from the same song sheet, but nobody can agree on the key. Labor has not committed to the final two years of Gonski funding either, and the four states and one territory that signed up for it \u2013 New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, and ACT \u2013 are left hanging about funding post-2017. They deserve to know where, exactly, the Turnbull government stands on the signed deals, but the obfuscation continues. The recommendations of the Gonski review have been the best chance for needs-based funding this country has seen. The name Gonski \u2013 now elevated to the lexicon as a noun \u2013 has become synonymous with equity in education. And equity in Australian education is an issue. Much is made of Australia\u2019s standings in the OECD\u2019s program for international student assessment (Pisa) results, the triennial rankings that tests 15-year-olds in maths, science and reading, and how, by that measure, our educational standards have been dropping over the past 15 years.  Although there is much controversy about whether we should even pay attention to comparing countries by measuring 15-year-olds in vastly different systems, there is another OECD measure that should be more concerning for the government than whether students in Shanghai are better at maths than students in Sydney.  That is the data that shows Australia is one of the below average performers for having a widening gap between the highest performing students and the lowest performing students in relation to socio-economic background. Despite claims made by successive education ministers that Australia has a \u201chigh quality, high equity\u201d system, the truth is that the absolute measures of those doing well, and those who aren\u2019t, are dictated by their background.   Related: When it comes down to it, what are universities really for? | Andrew Campbell    Simon Birmingham, one of the few LNP cabinet members who is a product of the public school system, says he supports parental choice, but what real choice is there if your local public school is so under-resourced and troubled that you would consider converting to Catholicism, as some parents do, or signing up for six or more years of financial stress to exercise that choice? Real choice would mean that all Australians feel secure in the knowledge that all public schools are funded to a level that means their children will not be disadvantaged in any way by going to the local high school. That children with learning or physical disabilities will be supported, that those who are lagging would be brought up to speed, that the gaps would be closed.  If we can do this in our education system, we have a better chance to do this in society. Because all the fine talk of being an innovation nation profiting from a glorious ideas boom will come to naught if we can\u2019t get the basics right \u2013 all children, regardless of postcode, having access to an excellent education.

As he strides around its premises on a quiet, green plot on the outskirts of the tourist town of Siem Reap, his patter is peppered with references to sustainability, empowerment, development and opportunity. But Pactics is not an NGO; after all, few NGOs would build themselves around a mission statement that aims \u201cto create a decent company that offers competitively priced, high-quality microfibre products in an environmentally and socially responsible way\u201d. Nor, however, is it most people\u2019s idea of a south-east Asian textile operation. Its factory has been designed by Stuart Cochlin Architects and is arranged around a series of cooling courtyards. Its four buildings are intended to \u201charvest\u201d daylight so there is no need for artificial light except during storms. Through the air above the waterlily-studded pond and the young trees being grown for shade, squadrons of dragonflies dart and dive. Set up by Holten in Shanghai in 2004, Pactics began its Cambodian operations in 2010. Three years later, the Siem Reap factory was built; today it produces lens cloths and spectacle bags for the likes of Oakley, Tiffany and Ray-Ban.  Holten says he chose to build a factory far from the capital, Phnom Penh, after hearing stories of young women flocking to the city in search of work in the garment trade only to end up sleeping 12 to a room and facing debt and sexual exploitation. \u201cWe believe a factory \u2013 even one that in terms of complexity is at the lower end of the manufacturing spectrum \u2013 can be very successful and competitive while at the same time making sure all people that contribute earn enough to properly support themselves and their [families],\u201d he says. The 320 people on the factory floor are divided into skilled and unskilled workers: the former are paid $125 a month plus 30% extra when targets are hit; the latter receive $125 a month plus 15%. Even if targets are not met, the company guarantees a basic wage of $125 a month and 44 days of paid holiday a year. In a country where the average annual income is just over $1,000 a head, such wages are highly sought after. Pactics is, predictably, big on corporate social responsibility. Not only does the factory house a creche, a first-aid room staffed by a nurse, a lending library and a subsidised canteen, it contributes $50 a year towards the cost of each employee\u2019s education and pays half the price of a crash helmet for its workers, most of whom, like the majority of Cambodians, rely on scooters for transport. New employees receive five days of training, during which they are taught how to work safely, recognise their labour rights and identify sexual harassment. Workers are also free to form and join unions, although so far none has, according to Holten. The factory\u2019s toilets are flushed with rainwater and it has total wheelchair access for those who have lost limbs to landmines or traffic accidents. Holten likes to think of it as an unusually enlightened enterprise, but he is adamant he is still running a business. \u201cWe believe that one very important factor of development and sustainability is for people to add value in a production process that produces for the world market,\u201d he says.  \u201cIn other words, we create work that does not exist by the grace of a local tourist market full of goodwill or in a process that is subsidised. At Pactics, people earn their money contributing to the manufacturing of products that are sold on a very competitive world market.\u201d     At the Siem Reap factory, which produces lens cloths and spectacle bags for leading brands, workers receive benefits such as help with the cost of education. Photograph: Sam Jones for the Guardian    Chanthy Khun, a 31-year-old quality control supervisor at the factory, worked in a garment factory in Phnom Penh before moving to Siem Reap, where she and her husband ran a streetfood stall. Although the stall yielded a good income, it wasn\u2019t always enough to get by on. \u201cDuring the high season, I could get three times what I get now but in the low season, we could only just survive,\u201d she says. \u201cI never want to go back to working in Phnom Penh. I feel proud because I get quite a lot of benefits and it\u2019s close to where I live.\u201d This year, Pactics expects to make a 12% profit on a turnover of $8.5m, and Holten hopes its success will help persuade others to emulate it. But even a company like Pactics sometimes has difficulty in communicating the advantages of its model. \u201cWe\u2019re failing to explain the value of this to our customers,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where we haven\u2019t performed well.\u201d In the meantime, he adds, Pactics will keep doing what it does \u201cbecause it\u2019s fun: we are at the absolute bottom of the [garment trade] selling products that cost six cents.

Reinventing Manchester In November, John Harris gave us four in-depth portraits of cities across the UK and the futures they face. His article on Manchester heard from local residents about the optimism they feel following the city\u2019s recent regeneration, and took a look at the role of local politics in a charged time of \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d devolution.  17. Priced out of London Sam Cookney may have moved all the way to Barcelona to escape the expensive living costs of the UK capital, but for those unwilling to move so far, where else in the UK is best to live and work if you\u2019re priced out of London? Five people shared their stories of making the move \u2013 to Edinburgh, Birmingham, Norwich, Bristol and Sunderland \u2013 and the benefits it has brought to their careers and lifestyles.  16. Groningen, the home of cycling The Netherlands is certainly home to some of the world\u2019s most cycle-friendly cities, and Groningen may just be its cycling capital. Some 61% of all trips in the city are made by bicycle, rising to more than 70% for trips made to educational institutions. But even that\u2019s not enough for the city authorities: they want to push cycling even more. Renate van der Zee reviewed the city\u2019s plans \u2013 from intelligent traffic lights and heated cycle paths to new \u201cpark and bike\u201d areas \u2013 as well as taking a look back at how cycling became so central to Groningen culture.

Segregated cities Throughout Europe, inequality is on the rise. And with increasing inequality comes rising segregation. Madrid, where the lack of affordable housing has forced young people to stay living with their parents, has seen segregation increase significantly. Peter Geoghegan analysed the factors at play in both European cities and others around the world, from Winnipeg\u2019s \u201cgreat divide\u201d to the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, where communities live in tents.  14. LA\u2019s underground cycle gangs Rory Carroll explored the sub-culture of bicycle tribes who claim the Los Angeles streets by night, from the Wolfpack Hustle to the Ovarian Psycos. Under the cover of darkness, these cycle gangs hold races and mass rides most nights \u2013 some blessed by city authorities, others wild and illegal. 13. Is this Britain\u2019s most isolated suburb? Before the housing development of Barking Riverside got a local shop, residents had to make an hour-long round trip just to buy a pint of milk. Tim Burrows visited this isolated community in the far east of London, the UK\u2019s largest brownfield regeneration scheme, which is still awaiting a rail station that may never come. There\u2019s no pub, no doctor\u2019s surgery, no cafe. \u201cWe get very tired of being told what we\u2019re going to have and [then seeing] what we end up getting,\u201d said one resident. 12. The strange case of the world\u2019s most remote cities From suburban isolation we move to something on much bigger scale. The city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, in Russia, sits on a distant peninsula surrounded by volcanoes. Iquitos, in the heart of the Amazon jungle, has no roads leading in or out. Even Perth is 1,300 miles away from its nearest metropolis, Adelaide. But where exactly is the world\u2019s most remote city? Nicholas Gill took a fascinating look at some of the places where cities thrive despite their disconnection. 11. Paris goes car-free Around the world, cities are making concerted efforts to limit car use, whether through temporary events or new policies. This September saw Paris implement its first car-free day: children cycled, a group of 1,000 skateboarders took to the streets, outdoor yoga was practised and the sky was bright blue. Angelique Chrisafis took a stroll along the pedestrianised Champs Elys\u00e9es.      Paris held a car-free day on 27 September. Photograph: Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images    10. The great bike helmet debate It\u2019s a debate that at the time attracted the most comments the Guardian Cities site had ever seen: should cyclists wear helmets or not? Renate van der Zee looked at two cities with different approaches: Seattle, where you will be fined $102 (\u00a367) for not wearing a helmet, and Amsterdam, where most resident adult cyclists don\u2019t ever feel the need to wear one. Which city has it right? 9. The strange city of Astana In the middle of Kazakhstan\u2019s seemingly endless flat plains lies Astana, the country\u2019s capital. Adorned with an array of extravagant buildings \u2013 including a glass pyramid, a Disney version of the White House and a finance ministry shaped as a dollar bill \u2013 Astana can be a bizarre pace to visit. Giles Fraser and Marina Kim took us inside the \u201cflashy toy-city\u201d, stuck between a Soviet past and a market-savvy present. 8. Pricey living: the world\u2019s most expensive cities Each day it can feel that life in our cities becomes increasingly expensive. But where is the most expensive city in the world, in terms of food, housing, living expenses or goods? A basic fast-food meal can set you back $18.95 in Luanda, Angola. In Monte Carlo, $1 million will buy you just 17 square metres of property. How does your city fare in the rankings? 7. The bare truth of France\u2019s popular nude town In the French town of Cap d\u2019Agde, people walk around, shop at the supermarket, go to the beach, queue up at the bank. Sound pretty normal? Well, it would be \u2013 but here, residents predominantly undertake these activities in the nude. Phil Hoad visited the resort, to understand what life is like in a naked town \u2013 and wondered if we\u2019ll see a totally nude city any time soon.  6. The subway sign quiz Subway signs can feel ubiquitous in those cities with underground public transport: they become a familiar feature of the cityscape. Familiar enough to identify the city though? Take this quiz to see which cities you can recognise simply from their subway typefaces.  5. The cities that really stress us out Anyone who lives in a city will know that urban life can cause a huge amount of stress: crowds, delays, noise and traffic all have to be contended with. But can one metropolis claim to be the most stressful city of all? From Cairo to Shanghai, Hayley Birch explores the places where daily city life can get a bit overwhelming.      Shanghai: one of the world\u2019s more stressful cities? Photograph: Paul Reiffer/REX Shutterstock    4. Windy cities Chicago may be known as the \u201cwindy city\u201d, but is it really the windiest metropolis in the world? Sitting on the Cook Strait, New Zealand\u2019s capital Wellington experiences a so-called \u201criver of wind\u201d effect. St John\u2019s in Canada, Punta Arenas in Chile and Spain\u2019s Pamplona all have reputations for their blustery weather. But from resilient residents to non-existent air pollution and the harnessing of green energy, there are some upsides of a windy city too, as Karl Mathieson explained. 3. Homes made of shipping containers From housing for the homeless in Brighton to student housing in Amsterdam, shipping containers seem to be the innovative material of choice for low-cost housing (as well as pop-up shopping malls). But what is it really like to live in one \u2013 and are we actually going to see them become a standard format for new homes? Adam Forrest took us inside life in a steel box.

Some cities have distinctive street patterns, like the Haussmannian boulevards of Paris and the grid of Manhattan. But can other cities be identified by their street plans alone? Test your knowledge of city street patterns with our picture quiz.  1. The \u2018naked\u2019 metro map quiz And finally, it\u2019s another quiz which takes the crown. We already tested you with the subway signs and street patterns, now what about the geographically accurate maps of the underground metro systems? See if you can guess the city by looking at the patterns of their \u201cnaked\u201d metro maps \u2013 without any names or references \u2013 and let us know your score!", "tags": ["Cities", "World news", "2015 in review"], "publicationDate": "2015-12-30T08:00:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/ftse-100-ends-2015-among-worlds-worst-performing-markets", "sentences": ["Related: FTSE 100 index posts 5% loss for 2015 - business live    It means London investors missed out on the returns enjoyed by their rivals in Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo and Shanghai.", "Despite August\u2019s slump, China\u2019s Shanghai stock exchange gained 10% during 2015, outperforming the FTSE."], "title": "FTSE 100 ends 2015 among world's worst performing markets", "article": "City investors are nursing losses after the FTSE 100 ended the year as one of the worst performers among global stock markets. Britain\u2019s biggest share index shed almost 5% during a volatile 12 months dominated by the commodities crunch and fears over China\u2019s slowing economy.   Related: FTSE 100 index posts 5% loss for 2015 - business live    It means London investors missed out on the returns enjoyed by their rivals in Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo and Shanghai. In a lacklustre New Year\u2019s Eve trading session, the blue-chip index dropped 31 points to finish the year at 6,242. That left it 324 points adrift of the 6,566 point mark where it began the year - a decline of 4.9%. Connor Campbell, an analyst at the City firm SpreadEx, said it was a \u201climp, whimpering finish\u201d to the year. \u201cAfter a year that began so promisingly the markets are wrapping up 2015 in the limpest way possible, a collective sigh instead of any attempt at New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks,\u201d he said.   The FTSE 100 during 2015 The FTSE 100 during 2015   Nine months ago, City traders were celebrating as the FTSE broke through the 7,000-point mark for the first time. It reached an all-time closing high of 7103.98 in April. The index was rocked over the summer, however, as evidence mounted that China\u2019s economy could suffer a \u201chard landing\u201d. It shed a tenth of its value in four dramatic days, as the so-called Great Fall of China rocked markets across the globe. This fuelled a collapse in commodity prices. Crude oil has fallen by almost a third this year, while copper has tumbled by 25%. Gold fell by 10%, posting its third annual fall in a row. This in turn triggered major slumps in the value of the world\u2019s mining giants, many of whom are listed in London. Anglo American, which produces platinum, copper, nickel and iron ore, plunged by 75% to record lows during 2015.

While the FTSE lost ground, the German DAX posted a 9.8% gain and France\u2019s CAC index jumped by 8.5%. European indices benefitted from the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme, announced in January, which weakened the euro and helped eurozone exporters. The London stock market also suffered from concern that a rise in US interest rates would derail emerging market economies. That historic hike finally came two weeks ago, starting the process of \u201cnormalising\u201d monetary policy and weaning investors off ultra-cheap money. The prospect of a Federal Reserve rate rise drove the dollar up by around 9% against other currencies this year.      Commodity prices in 2015 Photograph: Thomson Reuters    That was welcome news for Japan, where a weak yen should combat deflation and help exports. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied by 9% during the year. Despite August\u2019s slump, China\u2019s Shanghai stock exchange gained 10% during 2015, outperforming the FTSE. It rallied during the autumn, as authorities committed to new measures to prop up share prices. The US market was more subdued, the Dow Jones ending the year 2.23% down, although the Nasdaq Composite was 5.73% up, with a degree of investor enthusiasm for tech shares not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.  Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange firm World First, believes Beijing\u2019s ability to stabilise its economy will shape the global outlook in 2016. \u201cChina at the moment is feeling the blowback of years of investment driven growth with industries chock full of unproductive factories, a housing sector with a significant stock overhang and ensuing high debt levels in local government and corporate balance sheets,\u201d he said. Some analysts believe that the London stock market will struggle to achieve major gains in 2016. William Hill is offering odds of 7/2 that the FTSE 100 will be over 7,000 points in a year\u2019s time, but only 6/4 that it finishes 2016 between 6,000 and 6,499 points. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a vast amount of movement in the FTSE 100 this year,\u201d said a spokesman. The City will spend the coming months fretting about whether UK interest rates will rise for the first time since 2007, according to Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG. \u201cThere is reason to believe that 2016 will also see sentiment largely driven by the movement of oil prices, their impact upon inflation expectations and the subsequent monetary policy stance from the Bank of England,\u201d he said. The weakening oil price has hurt Russia\u2019s currency. On Thursday, the Russian rouble hit fresh record lows, touching 74 roubles to the dollar. 2015 was \u201ca rotten year for emerging markets\u201d generally, said Kit Juckes of the French Bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.  \u201cThe big losers include the newly floating/sinking Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the South African rand and the Colombian peso, which are all down by more than 25% against the dollar and are even down against the rouble.\u201d", "tags": ["FTSE", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "Stock markets", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2015-12-31T17:08:47Z"}], "docs": 544}
