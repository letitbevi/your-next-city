The Chinese name of the restaurant was Fu Shing, after Cantonese pop star Kwok Fu Shing, one of the four 1990s Hong Kong superstars, collectively known as the four heavenly kings. Fu Shin \u2013 or Aaron Kwok as he\u2019s known in English \u2013 was my mum\u2019s favourite. She probably still listens to them all.

It was really old-school, badly decorated with half the wall painted pink, the top half sponged blue. At the front there was a mock Chinese roof, green tiles, inside, on the bar. I\u2019d want to eat at the back around the big communal table, with the lazy susan in the middle, just like we used to. All the chefs and the staff would be with us, and there\u2019d be karaoke playing. My Chinese name (given to me by a fortune teller for good luck) is Shing Ling \u2013 we were all given Chinese names by a fortune teller, for good luck. At karaoke, I\u2019d always sing this one song \u2013 Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters \u2013 because of the lyrics: \u201cevery shing-a-ling-a-ling that they\u2019re starting to sing \u2026\u201d. It would be autumn, my favourite part of the year \u2013 I love the changing of the seasons, the leaves falling, the crisp air. It would be an early evening meal, with my close friends and family. We have big family gatherings all the time, for birthdays, for Chinese New Year, at Christmas \u2013 but it\u2019s usually fairly quiet. We\u2019d play cards, that sort of thing. I would start with oysters \u2013 served with a mignonette sauce. I really like vinegary foods. And that would be followed by Shanghai dumplings, Beijing dumplings and pan-fried dumplings, they\u2019d just keep coming from the kitchen \u2013 I love them all. Dumplings in general are my favourite thing, they make me so happy. I\u2019d want a dumpling master to make them, because they\u2019re really tricky to get right. My brother Shing\u2019s maths teacher was also an excellent dumpling chef, and he first made me Beijing dumplings. Then I discovered Shanghai dumplings \u2013 with the soup inside \u2013 when Shin and I went to China. My favourite pan-fried dumplings are from Din Tai Fung \u2013 I don\u2019t know how they get the pastry skins so thin, perfectly crispy. Otherwise, it would mostly be my mum cooking. She\u2019s really creative \u2013 she still surprises me with certain things she produces, like making black garlic by putting garlic in a rice cooker for three days. She picks up a lot of tips and she\u2019s always trying out new things. I would want her to cook her lobster with ginger and spring onions on crispy noodles. There\u2019d also be some lamb skewers in xinjiang spice and the home-style cabbage from Silk Road \u2013 a really simple cabbage cooked in soy and garlic, it\u2019s ever so sweet, so tasty. I\u2019d also want their cold tripe dish: the spices and seasoning they use, it\u2019s the perfect mix of saltiness, spice and sugar with Sechuan chilli \u2026 Silk Road is up there as one of my favourite restaurants. We\u2019d have chishang rice \u2013 Taiwanese short-grain plump rice, it\u2019s such a great rice, you can feel each grain individually. With rice it\u2019s mostly about texture. And we\u2019d have Chinese roast duck with soy sauce, soaking into the rice. To drink, we\u2019d have a bottle of Manzanilla sherry \u2013 it would cut beautifully through the richness of the food. Sherry is so often associated with old grannies as something really sweet, but I love the dryness of it. And, for dessert, I\u2019d want something really comforting: an apple crumble with custard.

Instead, you are a jiejie (older sister) or meimei (younger sister); a gege (older brother) or didi (younger brother). Hierarchy and family relationships have been central to Chinese society for millennia. But in the past four decades, this central fact has changed utterly. For the majority of the population, siblings have become a theoretical concept. In 1980, China implemented perhaps the boldest experiment in social control of a population in world history: it declared that, with some important exceptions, Chinese couples would be permitted to have only one child each.   Related: China ends one-child policy after 35 years    This demographic demand was a sharp reversal of existing policy. During the era of Mao, the Chinese were encouraged to have as many children as possible: in the Chairman\u2019s words, \u201cthe more people we have, the greater our force\u201d. But by the 1970s, as the economy settled down and the population kept growing, planners became worried that China\u2019s population would become too large to support itself. At the time, neo-Malthusianism was in fashion around the world: the scientist Paul Ehrlich argued in his book The Population Bomb (1968) that \u201cin the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programmes embarked upon now\u201d. China\u2019s leaders may not have read Ehrlich, but their own demographers promoted a similar message. And unlike the leaders of almost all the other highly populated countries of the time, China had a tool that it could use in response: authoritarian coercion. Mei Fong\u2019s vivid and thoroughly researched book tells the story of the consequences of China\u2019s decision to restrict its population size. Her story begins with her taking a stifling ride on a packed train to Sichuan in 2008 with a group of peasant farmers returning home to find out if their only children have been killed in the terrible earthquake that hit the province that year. She also ventures to remote villages where local officials are charged by the central government with maintaining the one-child policy, leading to cases of forced abortions. One such case in 2012, where a woman named Feng Jianmei was held down and injected forcibly with an abortifacient, even caused a scandal within China and a declaration by the national authorities that they would review the operation of the policy. Fong also takes us inside the decisions that led to the formation of the policy. In the late 1970s, the Chinese government decided that demographics was in fact rocket science and set a group of cyberneticists and engineers to ponder the problem. They decided that China\u2019s ideal population size was 700 million and set out a linear model to show how it could be achieved by restricting births. As one of them put it in a 1988 book: \u201cSince human beings appeared in the world millions of years ago, they have been battling with nature. Now they have finally conquered it with their wisdom and strength.\u201d Unfortunately, the rocket engineers failed to consult any social scientists who might have pointed out that regulating family size is not the same as tweaking the measurements on ailerons or boosters.   Related: Paul Ehrlich, a prophet of global population doom who is gloomier than ever    As a result of social changes that the mathematicians failed to see, China is now getting older rapidly. On current projections, 34% of China\u2019s population will be over 60 by 2050 (it\u2019s around 12% now). Families have spent tremendous amounts of time and money in investing in the future of the one child who will be a significant part of their pension plan. No wonder that in 2015, the Chinese government announced that the policy would change to allow all families up to two children. Yet as Fong points out, the policy may well have been unnecessary in the first place. Many developing countries have seen significant reductions in the population as they become richer, healthier and more urbanised. Japan is currently in staggering demographic decline (more than a fifth of the population is over 65) without any coercion at all; economic decline and anomie appears to have done the trick, along with a refusal to allow much immigration. In Shanghai, families have been permitted to have two children for some years (and in fact the policy nationwide always had huge numbers of loopholes). Nonetheless, Shanghai families are overwhelmingly choosing to stick to one child; the high cost of everything from property to education makes this more economically logical.    In 2012, a woman named Feng Jianmei was held down and injected forcibly with an abortifacient    Fong doesn\u2019t examine in detail the way that the concept of \u201coverpopulation\u201d has been questioned since the 1970s, but many factors have undermined it; for instance, China is a major trading partner with the world and has no need to be self-sufficient in food, and the green revolution in crops meant the spread of high-yield grains. Today there is much more concern about the sustainability of our lifestyles \u2013 can every Chinese or, indeed, American, own a car with the pollution that that implies? \u2013 rather than on the total number of people per se. Nor is China\u2019s so-called demographic crisis insoluble, as it could be addressed by the encouragement of large-scale immigration into China; economically plausible but culturally difficult. Still, the consequences of the one-child policy will affect not just China but the wider world economy for decades to come. Fong\u2019s fine book is a moving and at times harrowing account of the significance of decisions taken by a small coterie of men (no women) with too much faith in science and ideology, and too little in humanity.

Slow manufacturing numbers were a trigger for Monday\u2019s China-inspired falls in stock markets around the globe, but the worries were also fuelled by memories of Beijing\u2019s cack-handed attempts to prop up share prices last summer. Nobody wants a see another shambolic exercise in state-sponsored market intervention, but a repeat performance is a possibility.   Related: Factory figures make for grim reading as global stock markets fall    To refresh memories, a 30% fall in the Shanghai Composite Index over a few weeks last May and June prompted a series of emergency measures that, if attempted in the west, would have been deemed ridiculous. State-backed investment funds spent billions buying stocks. Notionally independent stockbrokers and fund managers were encouraged to join in. Finance houses dished out cheap loans to private investors to bet on recovery. It was an extraordinary response to what looked, to most outsiders, like a healthy correction in a stock market that had climbed too high, too quickly. The Shanghai Composite had previously gained 150% in a year and no market can sustain that pace. Being generous, one could say the state-funded intervention to \u201cuphold market stability\u201d worked. Share prices indeed stabilised and Beijing got a pat on the back from the supposedly free-market International Monetary Fund for preventing a \u201cdisorderly\u201d market. The Shanghai Composite ended 2015 up 9% on the year. The problem, though, is that artificial props under share prices can be hard to remove. Worse, they sometimes require reinforcement if the old cracks are still apparent. That point may be arriving, since one factor behind Monday\u2019s selling was the fear that large institutions will dump shares when the ban on sales is lifted soon. Investors\u2019 underlying confidence in valuations, it seems, is weak. Another contributor was the newly created \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d, another product of last summer\u2019s drama. Trading was suspended for 15 minutes after a 5% fall in the main index. When trading resumed, prices quickly hit the 7% cut-off point to halt trading for the day, a predictable response. Do circuit breakers calm nerves and allow cool heads to prevail, which is the ambition, or do they merely intensify panic when markets reopen? We\u2019ll find out in coming days. But, by most conventional yardsticks, Chinese stock markets are still severely overvalued. If prices continue to slide, it is easy to imagine another round of demands for the authorities to rescue investors in the name of stability and prevent a broader loss of confidence among over-borrowed households. In reality, Beijing would be silly to get back on the intervention treadmill. In the end, the only sure way to create a stable stock market is to allow prices to find their own level. Far-sightedness, however, requires the authorities in a state-controlled economy to accept that share prices do not march to ordained scripts. There is no evidence that Beijing has accepted that lesson from last summer. No wonder investors elsewhere are worried. Less than direct with investors Sports Direct is in the \u201cclarification\u201d business. In this instance, it wants to make clear that Michael Murray, the 26-year-old boyfriend of founder Mike Ashley\u2019s daughter, is not a director of any Sports Direct company. Since nobody had suggested otherwise (instead, Murray was described as a director of three Ashley-linked companies outside Sports Direct) it is odd that the sportswear retailer felt annoyed. So what is Murray\u2019s role at Sports Direct itself? Investors were told he \u201cheads up\u201d the property team in the UK and abroad and has the task of finding new sites for the chain\u2019s larger-format stores and its shop-plus-gym units. It\u2019s a big job since the company is said to be spending \u00a3250m on expansion.  It is also a job that most FTSE 100 retailers would hand to an experienced property specialist on a full-time basis. But Murray\u2019s services are secured via a consultancy agreement and he is paid up to 25% of the \u201cincreased value\u201d that Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors judge to be created. Why is the youthful Murray the best person for this role? How on earth do the non-executives go about calculating the \u201cincreased value\u201d of a property purchase? And will shareholders be told the outcome of their deliberations? At that point, Sports Direct\u2019s clarifications cease. The company declined to answer all three questions. Outside shareholders must therefore accept the possibility that millions of pounds will be paid as a success fee to the boyfriend of the boss\u2019s daughter without outsiders being told the basis of the payments. Ashley owns 55% of the shares, so presumably can ignore all complaints from his outside investors. But to describe Monday\u2019s statement as a clarification is a joke. Persimmon payout is too much, too soon Mike Farley, former chief executive of Persimmon, left the housebuilder in April 2013 with \u201cour gratitude and best wishes for his retirement\u201d, as his chairman put it at the time. Warm words were appropriate since Persimmon, under Farley, was one of the few big UK housebuilders that did not require a bailout by its shareholders during the 2008-2011 downturn. But Farley departed with more than mere thanks. He was also granted a slice of Persimmon\u2019s grand 2012-22 incentive scheme, even though he was at the helm for less than a year of the performance period. His portion is now worth \u00a316m and was delivered on New Year\u2019s Eve even though the scheme runs to 2022.

They are training with Hasadin, a team of elite rangers formed in June 2015, whose mission is to stop the Siamese rosewood tree from being driven to extinction by poachers.  \u201cThe poachers don\u2019t care if we\u2019re rangers ... if they meet us and they have weapons in their hands, they shoot immediately without warning,\u201d says Piroon Pilaphop, leader of Hasadin\u2019s Dong Yai wildlife sanctuary team.   Siamese rosewood is a hardwood species confined to the remaining forested areas of just four countries in the Mekong region \u2013 Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. Renowned for its blood-red colour, the highly coveted endangered species is illegally logged in Thailand and smuggled through mainland south-east Asia to luxury \u201chongmu\u201d furniture markets in China.  Conservationists have warned that with rates of illegal logging increasing by 850% in recent years, Thailand\u2019s Siamese rosewood trees could be extinct within a decade.  Large trees in protected forests have become so scarce that their plunder is more akin to wildlife poaching. Increasingly large groups of illegal loggers cross the Thai-Cambodian border with weapons and are willing to engage in firefights in order to get the highly valuable \u201cblood wood\u201d.     Rosewood logs from trees likely several hundred years old. Photograph: EIA/Mongabay/Mongabay    \u201cRosewood is becoming harder and harder to find. The last big rosewood trees are in the deep forest, so the smugglers are moving deeper and deeper into Thailand,\u201d says Khajornsak Anantuk, a sergeant major with the Ta Phraya border police, who is helping to train the rangers. In the war against rosewood poaching, rangers train in self defence, patrol, conducting raids, making arrests, weapons and explosives identification. In the classroom they study poachers\u2019 rights, GPS mapping, forest law and species identification.  The poachers have increasing safety in numbers - vastly outnumbering the rangers - and in the deep forests the rosewood has to be carried out on foot. \u201cIf they want 60 pieces of wood, they have to bring more than 60 people because it\u2019s one piece for one person. They also bring guards and front scouts,\u201d says Booncherd Jaroensuk, head of Ta Phraya national park.  Seven forest rangers died in 2015 in relation to violent Siamese rosewood crime, according to the Freeland Foundation, an organisation based in Bangkok working to improve ranger training in Thailand.  Most loggers previously came from the border region with Cambodia, but some are now allegedly brought in from as far as the Cambodian-Vietnam border by traffickers. \u201cThe people along the border have got wise to how dangerous it is, so the middlemen are bringing people from over on the Vietnam border who don\u2019t know anything ... sometimes they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s a protected forest,\u201d says Tim Redford, training coordinator at Freeland.  In September last year, 23 Cambodian would-be loggers fled their traffickers upon discovery that Siamese rosewood was their target, and handed themselves over to the Thai police, according to the Cambodia Daily. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of human trafficking \u2026 they are being tricked into it ... there have been two cases recently where Cambodians have been taken into the forest and told that they were going to be working on legal timber projects or on construction work,\u201d says Redford.     A bed made from Siamese rosewood reportedly sold for US$1m in Shanghai in 2011. Photograph: EIA/Paul Redman    \u201cI wish they would just arrest the big guys so the problem will finally stop,\u201d says Hasadin ranger Piroon, referring to the catalogue of corrupt officials, businessmen, and brokers involved in the clandestine transnational trade that carves its murky way throughout south-east Asia. The lucrative trade saw $1.2bn worth of Siamese rosewood imported to China between 2000 and 2014, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Sold for 200 baht (\u00a33.60) a kilo on the forest floor, it currently fetches more than \u00a330,000 per tonne (\u00a330/kilo) in China\u2019s wholesale markets. EIA reported a bed made from Siamese rosewood being sold for US$1m in Shanghai in 2011.  Siamese rosewood was listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in 2013 in an attempt to curb the decimation of south-east Asia\u2019s remaining stocks. The listing should have prohibited the international trade in logs, sawn timber and veneers, but an annotation allowing for the legal trade in \u201csemi-finished\u201d products of Siamese rosewood has provided a catastrophic loophole.  \u201cThe biggest problem is the demand ... without that, there wouldn\u2019t be the tsunami of cash entering these badly governed countries which then exacerbates corruption, undermines the rule of law, and provides incentives for loggers to risk their lives,\u201d says Jago Wadley, senior forest campaigner at EIA.", "tags": ["Trees and forests", "Conservation", "National parks", "Thailand", "Laos", "Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Asia Pacific", "Environment", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-05T07:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/05/hiroshima-by-john-hersey-survivors-stories-carry-weight-of-history", "sentences": ["In May 1946 they sent the war correspondent John Hersey, who was in Shanghai, to see what he would find."], "title": "Hiroshima by John Hersey \u2013 survivors' stories carry weight of history", "article": "A quiet hysteria buzzed through Hiroshima in the summer of 1945. The Americans had been firebombing Japan for weeks, and it was one of only two key cities they had not yet hit. B-29 Superfortresses were stationed north-east of Hiroshima and had been flying ominously overhead \u2013 locals called these planes B-san or Mr B. \u201cThe frequency of the warnings and the continued abstinence of Mr B with respect to Hiroshima had made its citizens jittery,\u201d wrote the New Yorker\u2019s John Hersey. \u201cA rumour was going around that the Americans were saving something special for the city.\u201d And then it came. At 8.15am on 6 August, Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. More than 100,000 people died, instantly or in the atomic bomb\u2019s aftermath. \u201cSuch clouds had risen that there was a sort of twilight around \u2026 The day grew darker and darker,\u201d Hersey wrote. A different sort of darkness would linger in Hiroshima. Western press reports on the attack mainly covered the gruesome statistics; missing were the stories of the survivors. That autumn, New Yorker editor William Shawn decided the magazine had to cover the story. \u201cHe wants to wake people up and says we are the people with a chance to do it, and probably the only people to do it,\u201d Harold Ross, the magazine\u2019s founder, wrote to EB White. In May 1946 they sent the war correspondent John Hersey, who was in Shanghai, to see what he would find.   Related: Hiroshima and the nuclear age \u2013 a visual guide    The result was Hiroshima, a 30,000-word piece published in a single issue in August 1946 and later reprinted as a book. Over the years, it has been recommended to me several times, often by other writers, as a canonical example of New Journalism. I duly added it to my list of books to read, but another title always seemed to make its way to the top of the pile beside my bed. In 2015, however, I received a slender edition of Hiroshima, released by Penguin on the 70th anniversary of the attack. When I look back on a year of reading, it is this book I would recommend without hesitation to anyone saddened and distressed by news from Paris, Beirut, San Bernardino, Syria. The subject is not festive, but it is utterly, horribly contemporary. Hersey tells the intertwined stories of six people in Hiroshima in the hours and weeks after the attack: a young surgeon; a pastor; a tailor\u2019s widow with three children; a prosperous doctor; a female clerk at a tin factory; and a German priest. Its tick-tock approach gives it a Law and Order quality, as it switches its focus between the six subjects. But it is so much more: a chronicle of life amid the wreckage, with nary a word of hyperbole \u2013 a book that seems, at the close of 2015, more relevant than ever. It never promises an explanation for war, it never preaches. It eschews statistics in favour of story. In fact, Hersey\u2019s writing is so straightforward as to seem plain, but he often uses just the right word, or a simple but exquisite phrase, or a shattering detail, and his sentences are unmediated by a writerly presence. In one chapter, the pastor Mr Tanimoto was looking for a boat that would help him ferry the gravely injured across the river to safety. He came upon a punt on the shore. \u201cIt was an awful tableau \u2013 five dead men, nearly naked, badly burned, who must have expired more or less all at once, for they were in attitudes which suggested that they had been working together to push the boat down into the river.\u201d Mr Tanimoto knew what he must do: he dutifully pulled the bodies away from the boat, but was so disturbed by \u201cpreventing them, he momentarily felt, from going on their ghostly way \u2013 that he said out loud, \u2018Please forgive me for taking this boat. I must use it for others, who are alive.\u2019\u201d     A toddler cries amid the rubble of the city. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    Hiroshima is stitched together with many moments like this. Early on, we meet the tailor\u2019s widow shortly after the mysterious explosion: \u201cAs Mrs Nakamura stood watching her neighbour, everything flashed whiter than any white she had ever seen \u2026 the reflex of a mother set her in motion towards her children. She had taken a single step \u2026 when something picked her up and she seemed to fly into the next room, over the raised sleeping platform, pursued by parts of her house.\u201d (The family survived.)   Related: After the A-bomb: Hiroshima and Nagasaki then and now \u2013 in pictures    Hersey\u2019s documentary eye captures a full spectrum of feeling \u2013 panic, grief, disgust, resilience, hope \u2013 often on the same page. The German Jesuit Father Kleinsorge is at Asano Park, on the outskirts of the city, climbing over dead bodies to fill a teapot with fresh water, which he will offer to survivors. Coming back, he finds a group of 20 injured soldiers: \u201cTheir faces were wholly burned, their eye sockets were hollow, the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks.\u201d With a flash of ingenuity, he makes a straw from a piece of grass so the men, whose mouths are swollen and covered in pus and who will probably not live out the night, can drink. \u201cSince that day, Father Kleinsorge has thought back to how queasy he had once been at the sight of pain \u2026 Yet in the park he was so benumbed that immediately after leaving this horrible sight he stopped on a path by one of the pools and discussed with a lightly wounded man whether it would be safe to eat the fat, two-foot carp that floated dead on the surface of the water. They decided, after some consideration, that it would be unwise.\u201d Hiroshima is filled with evidence of humanity at its worst and best, with stories of generosity, grief and pain. I was sickened by some descriptions, while others were surprising, like when the priests discovered that the pumpkins at the mission had roasted on the vine and made a tasty dinner. I also found myself disheartened that the book had little sense of resolution.   Related: The Guardian view on the Hiroshima legacy: still in the shadow of the bomb | Editorial    In the months after the attack, Japanese people tried to make sense of what had happened. Some were angry, some detached: \u201cIt was a war and we had to expect it,\u201d many said. Others were philosophical: \u201cThe crux of the matter is whether total war in its present form is justifiable, even when it serves a just purpose. Does it not have material and spiritual evil as its consequences, which far exceed whatever good might result? When will our moralists give us a clear answer to this question?\u201d  Hersey doesn\u2019t attempt one himself and, notably, he closes with a young boy describing life after the atomic bomb. The boy seems remarkably well adjusted, so much so that it suggests the message that life goes on, that children will grow up and they will get by \u2013 one I found difficult to accept, perhaps because I realised that, 70 years later, not much has changed. In this way, Hiroshima doesn\u2019t seem like a history lesson. It is a raw, very human account of the death, destruction and resilience that, all these decades later, we still witness around the world.

Despite falls elsewhere in the region, Chinese stocks edged up on Wednesday on hopes that regulators would extend a ban on share sales by major stakeholders as Beijing scrambled to avert a potential repeat of last summer\u2019s market crash.  The CSI300 index of leading companies was up 1.5% in late afternoon trading. State media reported the ban on some share sales, which had been due to expire on Friday, would remain in place until new rules to manage the process are promulgated.  The market was also helped by statements from at least 30 companies saying their controlling shareholders or senior executives would not sell shares on the secondary market within the next six or 12 months to help stabilise the stock market.  The reports were the latest damage-control measures announced after China\u2019s major benchmark indexes plunged 7% on Monday, forcing the first-ever nationwide trading halt and roiling global markets.  Many traders largely attributed Monday\u2019s sell-off to fears that the expiry of the share sale ban, imposed during the height of the market rout last year, could see an estimated 1.24 trillion yuan ($190.23bn) of shares dumped onto the market.  However, some say further restricting share sales by major shareholders was not justified, and would do little to help the market.  \u201cExtending the restrictions would only prolong the problem, rather than cure it,\u201d said Shen Weizheng, fund manager at Shanghai-based Ivy Capital. Companies can extend the ban for six months, \u201cbut what about six months later? It\u2019s like the sword of the Damocles overshadowing the market.\u201d  The latest worrying news on China came in a private survey which showed activity in China\u2019s services sector expanded at its slowest rate in 17 months in December, bucking robust findings in an official survey and a further indication that the world\u2019s second-largest economy has lost momentum.  Policymakers and economists have been hoping that growth in services would offset persistent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and keep the economy from cooling too sharply. As the move to safe haven assets such as the yen and the US dollar continued on Wednesday, markets were also rocked after the People\u2019s Bank of China set the yuan\u2019s midpoint rate at its weakest level in 4-1/2 years.  China has guided the yuan lower since a surprise devaluation of the currency last summer, rattling traders who fear it could eventually set off a round of competitive devaluations which will put further pressure on other emerging economies.  Some see the tactic as a desperate attempt by China to shore up growth, prompting concerns that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy could be even weaker than imagined, though others say further yuan weakness is inevitable in the face of the strong US dollar.  The US dollar touched a near three-month low of 118.35 yen and the euro slid to a nine-month trough of 127.465 yen . The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell by about three basis points to 2.22%. Bond yields move down when the price moves up.

He could, almost certainly, have survived yet another set of dire clothing sales figures because the food division continued its strong run over Christmas. What\u2019s more, the chairman, Robert Swannell, has never seemed the axe-wielding type. A departure in April suits all parties. Bolland gets to choose his moment and can point out correctly that six years counts as a long stint for a FTSE 100 chief executive these days. The new boss, Steve Rowe, who did four good years in food, had seemed earmarked for the top job since he was switched last July to clothing. Best to get him in post before his food halo slipped with the rotten 5.8% like-for-like decline in general merchandise over the festive period. The verdict on Bolland\u2019s reign? Better than his critics make out. He made a mistake at the outset by saying M&amp;S could be rewired into \u201ca truly international, multichannel retailer\u201d within three years and had to abandon his sales targets within 12 months. But the level of past underinvestment at M&amp;S also became apparent. The warehousing system was a shambles and the website had been outsourced in panic to Amazon in 2004. An expensive infrastructure job was necessary, taking the website in-house and forcing capital expenditure above \u00a3800m a year for a while. The successful part of Bolland\u2019s reign is this: he did the behind-the-scenes rebuilding (with a few hiccups) while leaving the balance sheet stronger than he found it. That\u2019s worth a lot. The fashion failure is, of course, glaring. Managers and designers were shuffled, supply chains overhauled, and buying terms improved. Yet like-for-like sales have gone backwards for five years. The semi-consolation for investors is that profits margins were protected at Christmas, as Bolland promised they would be. Such a defensive strategy works until it doesn\u2019t. Sooner or later, a clothing retailer with vast acres of floorspace has to shift more clobber, rather than merely protect margins via efficiency gains. M&amp;S, like the supermarkets, has too much space for the internet era. Bolland barely scratched that issue. But, as a nuts-and-bolts operator, which is what M&amp;S needed in 2010, Bolland deserves credit. As with another high-profile Dutchman, Louis van Gaal at Manchester United, the punters are screaming for more flair but the league position \u2013 or shareholder returns \u2013 is respectable. Under Bolland, M&amp;S has averaged a total return, meaning dividends plus share price growth, of about 10% a year. Not bad. China finally abandons cack-handed circuit breakers     A Chinese investor looks through stock information in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. Photograph: Xinhua/Rex    Hurrah, the Chinese regulators have learned that, when in a hole, you should stop digging. They have suspended the circuit-breakers that have closed local stock markets twice this week. The cut-off mechanism always looked likely to cause, rather than prevent, chaos. The design was cack-handed. The trigger for trading to be paused for 15 minutes was set at just 5%, which hardly counts as an exceptional occurrence for a young stock market like China\u2019s. Worse, the system dictated that trading should be abandoned for the day after a 7% decline. Once 5% was hit, a further slide became a near-certainty as sellers tried to get out while they still had the chance. The good news is that share prices will, in theory, have the chance to bounce after a quick fall. The bad news is that a seriously big fall is also possible. Indeed, the latter seems more likely because the bubble that developed between June 2014 and May 2015 \u2013 when the Shanghai composite index rose 150% \u2013 has never deflated. This week\u2019s 12% slide in index move valuations towards saner territory. But a reasonable case can be made that Chinese stocks are still over-priced by anything up to 50%, especially if the yuan is now being allowed to decline gradually against the dollar.

Experts say the credibility of Beijing\u2019s economic policymakers has been further damaged by the latest week of financial turmoil. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso questioned whether Beijing could afford to keep supporting the yuan in light of its record decline in foreign reserves last month. On Friday morning there were unconfirmed reports that Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), was set to resign. \u201cChinese authorities\u2019 ability to manage the capital markets and their currency has been greatly dented this week because they put into place what turned out to be very badly thought out new regulations for the capital markets that have only added to volatility,\u201d said Nicholson. \u201cI think the markets are still waiting to see what happens next week and how determined the Chinese government will be in intervening in both the equity and currency markets, to try and manage both of them. Any sort of rebound in global equities \u2013 a major rebound at least \u2013 will probably be delayed until you do see a significant and continued intervention by the Chinese authorities in both the currency and the equity markets.\u201d Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC business school, said Beijing\u2019s economic flip-flopping and \u201cwild swings in policymaking\u201d had severely damaged confidence. \u201cChinese investors want very similar things that international investors want: they want clarity, they want to understand what is going on, they want to know what the policies are, they want stability and [to know] what the rules are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe constant back-and-forth and changes just don\u2019t engender confidence that Beijing has really any idea what they are doing.\u201d The depreciation of China\u2019s currency, the yuan or renminbi, has spooked investors and fuelled capital flight out of China. A dramatic day of global trading on Thursday saw \u00a330bn wiped off the FTSE 100. On Friday morning China\u2019s central bank appeared to respond to investor concerns by fixing its currency higher against the US dollar with a midpoint range of 6.5636 per dollar. However, Nicholson said Beijing was now in a major fix. On one hand it wants to see the yuan weaken in order to boost flagging exports amid signs China\u2019s economy was in far greater trouble than the government has admitted. On the other hand Beijing also desperately wants to avoid the global panic that the currency\u2019s devaluation would spark. \u201cThis is the dilemma they face,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to worry everybody and every time they devalue it causes panic globally. But at the same time they do need to devalue it. So while they can put a pause on it temporarily, inevitably they are going to start weakening it again.\u201d Nicholson added: \u201cAt this current juncture you might think there could be a pause on the renminbi weakening next week or perhaps for a couple of weeks. But at some point down the line they are going to restart it and maybe at the next point when they do it it is a one-off major devaluation. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when that could occur but certainly in the short term in that event it would be a crisis for equities and global economies.

Tropical rivers are traditionally less dammed than those in temperate regions partly because they are mostly far from large human populations and are in places hard to access. But now, as demand for electricity soars across Africa, Latin America and the south-east Asia, it is increasingly attractive to develop hydropower. In total, say the authors, over 450 large dams are planned for the three river basins. The consequences for food production is unknown, but it has been calculated that if 11 of the 12 mainstream dams are constructed on the Mekong, the total loss in fish could be between 550,000 and 880,000 tons a year. According to International Rivers, an environmental NGO, more than 100 species of fish in the region could face extinction. The paper takes as an example of the gap between official promises and reality the Three Gorges dam across the Yangtze river in China. This was finished in 2012 at a cost of around $20bn and was justified by the government as providing 10% of all China\u2019s electricity. In fact it generates under 2%.

Now the Chinese authorities are having to spend up to $26bn over 10 years to mitigate some of the adverse environmental effects.

The unprecedented building boom is widely justified as good for people because dams provide cheap electricity for development, and good for the environment because they are said to provide clean electricity and lower carbon emissions in a warming world. As such, they are likely to become more popular as countries try to meet the targets they set for themselves at the Paris climate summit in December. The reality is that they are anything but climate-neutral and are responsible for large volumes of CO2 emissions from the concrete needed to build them, and for vast quantities of powerful methane gas emissions from the rotting of vegetation and soils flooded by their large reservoirs. By some calculations, the world\u2019s 33,071 registered large dams may even produce 4% of all climate emissions. The world is right to seek clean energy, but the unintended consequences of a rush to tropical hydropower may be as dangerous as climate change itself.

Alas, the early signs this year on the economic front are hardly fresh \u2013 indeed they seem gloomily repetitive of last year.   Related: Australia bet the house on never-ending Chinese growth. It might not end well    Last week, the news was that China\u2019s stock market went into an interrupted free fall. The reason it was interrupted is the Chinese stock market regulators had instituted a policy of halting trading if the Shanghai 300 indexrose or fell more than 7% in any one day. It fell by that amount last Tuesday, and then did the same in just 25 minutes of trading on Thursday.  The circuit breaker measure designed to provide greater stability was then scrapped in order to provide ... er, greater stability.  If it all feels like we have seen this movie before, it is because back in July last year Chinese authorities had tried to institute regulations to stop massive falls in the stock market. These measures included suspending trading in about half the stocks, preventing short-selling, and getting the state-owned wealth fund to buy about $20bn worth of shares to buoy up the market. They didn\u2019t work very well. After a slight recovery, in August the Chinese share market fell 23% in one week:       By the end of the year, it had recovered some of the losses, but after last week\u2019s 9.9% fall, the index is now 37% below its June peak. And as usual, stock markets around the world followed suit.  The US Dow Jones index fell 5.5% in the first four days of trading this year \u2013 the worst start to a year since 1896! And in Australia, stocks went the same way \u2013 the ASX200 fell 5.76% in the week, with all the top 15 companies declining (BHP Billiton the worst with an 8.45% fall:   Related: Slowing growth in China raises red flag for global economy         It means that in the past 12 months, the Chinese, US and Australian stock markets have largely performed the same \u2013 losing between 5% and 9%:       The market madness was set off last Thursday by the Chinese government slightly devaluing its currency (which is pegged to the US dollar). This provoked fears China was about to set off a currency war. But the deeper issue was the reason for the devaluation \u2013 China\u2019s economy was not performing well at all.  Last Tuesday, the latest manufacturing price managers index was released.

Related: A volatile world is sending stock markets tumbling but don't panic    Just to make sure 2016 got off to a nice consistent start,  the World Bank announced on Thursday that it had revised down its growth forecast for the year. In July, it forecast the world economy would grow 3.3% in 2016; it is now predicting just 2.9%. Last week as well, the US billionaire investor George Soros suggested economic conditions were worse than in 2008. His main concern is China\u2019s large debt levels, which have fuelled a great deal of its economic growth over the past decade. This view was echoed by the analyst Marc Faber, who told ABC\u2019s Michael Janda that China had \u201cby historical standards the greatest credit bubble ever\u201d. To top it off, the former US Labor secretary Robert Reich also predicted last week that the US economy would be \u201cteetering on the edge of recession\u201d by the end of the year. So, I hope you feel nice and rested after the summer break! The news is not all bad \u2013 or at least the opinion on the news isn\u2019t. The economist Paul Krugman argues that while China looms large in the world\u2019s economy, it is not a totally dominant force and that its financial system is much more closed than that of the US \u2013 which means a China crash would not have the same impact on the rest of the world as the US financial crisis of 2007-08 did. That\u2019s all well and good for the US, but Australia\u2019s economy is more dependent on China for its exports than the US:        We know a hit to the Chinese economy will hurt Australia more than almost any other country. In 2013, the IMF warned that only Mongolia\u2019s economy would suffer more than Australia\u2019s if China\u2019s economy slowed from an average growth of 10% to 7.5% over the coming decade.  It\u2019s worth noting that the IMF now expects China\u2019s GDP growth to average just 6.2% from now till 2020:       So is there any good news?  Well, yes and no. The ructions in China have resulted in the value of the Australian dollar falling from US$0.73 at the start of the year to US$0.70. And the likelihood is that it won\u2019t be rising any time soon \u2013 especially with the market still predicting a likely interest rate cut by the end of this year:       The low dollar will assist exporters \u2013 especially the education sector, of which about a quarter of international students come from China:        Related: China interest rate cut fuels fears over ailing economy    And the concerns regarding debt and finance in China have some suggesting there will be a slackening of Chinese buyers in our real estate market. If you believe Chinese investment has helped fuel the housing price boom, the likelihood of that sector cooling has increased. That\u2019s great if you are looking to buy a home; not so great if you are looking to sell or are an investor.  The housing sector, however, is already off the boil. The latest building approval figures released by the Bureau of Statistics last week showed that in trend terms private building approvals had fallen for nine straight months:       So, much like last year, we see the story of Australia\u2019s economy as one with perils lurking ahead.  Exports have kept our economy growing solidly, if not strongly, but the concerns of China\u2019s economic stability will continue to worry investors. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad times are ahead, and the value of our currency will help to some extent with regard to falling commodity prices. But further falls in export values, combined with a slowing housing market, make for a tough time ahead for the economy.  A bad (or in reality, terrible) first week of the year does not mean a bad 12 months will follow.

Perceived mis-steps by China\u2019s authorities have stoked concerns in global markets that Beijing might be losing its grip on economic policy, just as the country looks set to post its slowest growth in 25 years. Amid suspicions by some in the market that China wants the yuan to devalue in order to boost its ailing exporters, sources suggested there were moves afoot for China\u2019s cabinet to take a bigger role in overseeing financial markets.  The state council has set up a working group to prepare for upgrading the cabinet\u2019s financial department to bureau level, said a source close to the country\u2019s leadership.  Officials were doing their best to talk up the currency which was trading up slightly at 6.5757 to the dollar at 4am GMT on Tuesday. The central bank\u2019s chief economist Ma Jun said on Monday that the bank planned to keep the yuan basically stable against a basket of currencies, and fluctuations against the US dollar would increase.   Han Jun, deputy director of the office of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s leading group on financial and economic affairs, said a more substantial decline in the yuan was \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d.        He was speaking at a briefing held at the Chinese consulate in New York, suggesting the authorities were broadening their verbal campaign to deter yuan sellers.  Not all are convinced, however.

Morgan Stanley has also cut its forecast, predicting that the yuan could fall to 7.31 to the dollar by the end of 2017. \u201cWhile policymakers are still trying to maintain the trade-weighted (yuan) exchange rate in a stable range, we now anticipate that they will transition towards targeting a depreciation ... earlier than initially expected,\u201d the bank said. \u201cThis move will help policymakers to still cut interest rates to manage deflationary pressures, but will imply further depreciation of the yuan (against the dollar).\u201d Figures for China\u2019s December trade accounts are due on Wednesday and are expected to show further falls in both exports and imports.

Looks can be deceptive. Nothing wrong with sensitive twee-pop sensibilities, of course, but when push comes to shove, he might not be cut out for Klopp\u2019s heavy-metal brand of football, is all.  So Klopp handed his list to Ian Ayre. The Liverpool chief suit roared off on his chopper, and a few hours later came back with a broad, satisfied smile on his boat and some booty packed into his pannier. \u201cHey J\u00fcrgen!\u201d chirped Ayre as he hopped, big leggy, off his Harley. \u201cYou know you wanted Neven Subotic, Jo\u00ebl Matip or Mats Hummels? Well, even better than that!\u201d And with a flourish, in the style of the guy from the Fast Show who would be sent out to the shops for eggs and potatoes before coming back with biscuits shaped like radios and a map of Cairo, he presented Klopp with new loan signing Steven Caulker, a man last seen in the centre of a Southampton defence that shipped six goals at home to Liverpool in the Milk Cup, bouncing around aimlessly in a passable homage to the title sequence of The Prisoner.

Although imports slumped 13.2% and exports were down 1.8%, the numbers surprised the markets where economists had been forecasting a much weaker reading.       Helped by further action from Beijing to stabilise the yuan and dampen fears of a devaluation, equity markets in the region initially bounced back after days of volatile trading. The oil benchmark Brent crude also edged up from 12-year lows touched of $30.43 on Tuesday. The mainland Chinese markets dipped in afternoon trading however, with the Shanghai Composite index down 0.88% 7am GMT and the CSI300 of leading stocks down 1.32%.  it was a brighter picture elsewhere in the region. The Australian ASX/S&amp;P200 index ended an eight-day losing streak by surging 1.26% while in Japan the Nikkei was up 2.8% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was also up more than 1%.  However, customs spokesman Huang Songping warned at a news conference that China\u2019s trade faced \u201cmany challenges\u201d in 2016 due to weak external demand, Reuters reported. One of the main reasons for China\u2019s lower exports in 2015 was weak external demand, he added. The 5% fall in the value of the yuan since last August had helped support exports but the impact would begin to fade, he said. Earlier, the People\u2019s Bank of China held the line on the yuan for a fourth straight session on Wednesday while putting the squeeze on offshore sellers of the currency.  The PBOC set the mid-point for the yuan at 6.5630 to the dollar, virtually unchanged from firm fixes on the previous two days.  The central bank has also used aggressive intervention to engineer a huge leap in yuan borrowing rates in Hong Kong, essentially making it prohibitively expensive to short the currency.  The result has been to drag the offshore level of the yuan back toward the official level, closing a gap that had threatened to get out of control just a few days earlier.  Confusion about China\u2019s policy had stoked concerns Beijing might be losing its grip on economic policy, just as the country looks set to post its slowest growth in 25 years.  Chris Weston at IG Markets in Melbourne welcomed a more stable day of trading but cautioned that Beijing may have delayed another outbreak of volatility by driving up funding costs in Hong Kong and making it impossible to short the yuan. \u201cWhat counts is the fact Chinese authorities have achieved their goal of converging the onshore and offshore yuan, with stability in the \u2018fix\u2019 and they have even seen a positive session in the equity markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame they had to go to such lengths to achieve this.

The campaign, a series of English and Chinese-language billboards and videos from conservation groups WildAid and the African Wildlife Foundation, aims to highlight how rhino horn is made primarily of keratin, the same protein that makes up human fingernails and hair, which has no medical benefits.  In one advert, Sir Richard is shown biting his nails next to the words: \u201cKeratin. That\u2019s all it is. No different or more a medical remedy than your fingernails. So with a dwindling rhino population, why kill off one of our planet\u2019s greatest species for no reason?\u201d Rhino horn is considered a status symbol in Vietnam and China, where the growth of the middle class has led to an explosion in demand for the horn, which is ground down and used as a traditional medicinal cure and recreational drug.

The rate had further intensified after a record total of 1,215 rhinos were killed in 2014.

A slump in imports by 7.6% year on year to $164bn (\u00a3114bn) accounted for the largest drop in trade, while exports were down 1.4% from a year earlier to $224bn, an improvement over the previous month\u2019s 6.8% contraction.

Traders were also cheered when the numbers were translated into the weakening local currency, the yuan, which showed exports reached a record value in December, up 2% on the previous year. They appeared to offset gloomy predictions of a stock market rout in 2016 made by several investment bank analysts, including RBS\u2019s credit chief, Andrew Roberts. Battered in recent days by a flurry of weak economic forecasts, China\u2019s stock market rallied almost 20 points initially, but comments by officials that weak demand for Chinese goods will continue to hurt the country\u2019s economy in 2016 sent the Shanghai composite down 2.4% by the end of the trading period to 2,949.  Some economists argued that the figures showed trade with China was beginning to stabilise after a year of contraction. Daniel Martin at Capital Economics said: \u201cChina\u2019s trade data support our view that, despite the turmoil in Chinese financial markets, there has not been a major deterioration in its economy in recent months.

Over the whole year it was $594bn. The trade surplus in December with the EU, its biggest trading partner, swelled 36.8% to $15.6bn. The surplus with the US contracted 6% to $19.4bn.   Some analysts questioned the trade figures, saying they were suspiciously buoyant after an unexplained 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong, meaning that the former UK colony imported more from mainland China than the US. Iris Pang, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg the increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u2019s imports from the city probably indicated \u201cfake invoicing\u201d. The invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said.   Related: China sees 'many challenges' in 2016 as trade slumps on weak external demand    Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who has predicted that global stock markets will tumble this year, said moves by the Chinese authorities to devalue the yuan to boost exports would have profound consequences for the global economy. He said that despite a large trade surplus, huge capital flight from China as savers take their cash out of the country was forcing regulators\u2019 hand. \u201cI have always thought that in order to revive a spluttering Chinese economy, the authorities would have to devalue, but not just because an overvalued exchange rate was squeezing their manufacturing sector.  \u201cInstead I felt that an overvalued exchange rate had steadily undermined competitiveness to the point that it had undermined the balance of payments. This was compounded last year by an accelerated capital outflow as anti-corruption measures intensified, and an unprecedented unwinding of dollar-denominated borrowings by Chinese corporates. All these factors have combined to take the Chinese balance of payments into deep deficit.\u201d Optimists also pointed to a rise in Chinese crude imports to a record 7.82m barrels in December, up more than 21% from November, as a reason to believe that China\u2019s ailing manufacturing sector was gearing up for better days.

The 48-year-old, who is also the curator of this year\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale, has made a name for himself over the past decade with projects that reinvent low-cost housing and engage residents in the design of their own homes. It is a refreshing choice for the Pritzker, usually awarded to later-career architects whose portfolios brim with grand cultural monuments.   Related: Alejandro Aravena: architect, equaliser, el visionario    Announcing the news, Tom Pritzker, whose father founded the prize in 1979, said Aravena\u2019s work \u201cgives economic opportunity to the less privileged, mitigates the effects of natural disasters, reduces energy consumption, and provides welcoming public space \u2026 He shows how architecture at its best can improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d Aravena and his architecture practice, Elemental, first came to international attention in 2004 with a project that redefined the economics of social housing. The challenge was to rehouse 100 families who had been squatting illegally on half a hectare of land in the centre of Iquique in northern Chile. The government\u2019s housing subsidy of US$7,500 (\u00a35,200) per family was nowhere near enough to buy the land and build new homes, particularity on such a valuable site. The usual solution would have been to relocate the residents to the outer suburbs, cutting them off from their families, friends and jobs.  \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t the money to build everyone a good house,\u201d said Aravena, on the telephone from his studio in Santiago, \u201cwe thought: why not build everyone half a good house \u2013 and let them finish the rest themselves.\u201d     Top: Interior of a house in Iquique financed with public money and, bottom, developed by residents.

The result was a far cry from the identikit slabs of nearby social housing blocks. The value of the properties has since increased five-fold, while the model has been rolled out in different forms on other sites in Chile and Mexico involving 2,500 homes.   Related: The rebuilding of Chile's Constituci\u00f3n: how a 'dead city' was brought back to life    Aravena is one of a number of young Chilean architects coming to international prominence \u2013 along with Serpentine pavilion architect Smiljan Radic, Mathias Klotz and Pezo von Ellrichshausen \u2013 a flowering that Aravena partly attributes to scarce resources. \u201cThe toughness of the circumstances can work as a useful filter against arbitrariness,\u201d he says. \u201cThis environment of scarcity stops you from doing things that are not strictly necessary \u2013 whereas abundance can sometimes lead to a culture of doing things just because you can.\u201d Trained at Universidad Cato\u0301lica de Chile Santiago, Aravena\u2019s first project was a new mathematics faculty for his alma mater, built in 1998. A medical school followed, then the refurbishment of the architecture school, along with a classroom tower and innovation centre, which stands on the Santiago skyline as a startling stack of monolithic concrete blocks. While Aravena has built an impressive portfolio of buildings, it is the bigger strategic questions that really drive his work, and for which he has been awarded the Pritzker.

The S&amp;P 500, which closed at 1,890 points, suffered its worst day since September and has fallen by 10% since its November peak taking it into \u201ccorrection\u201d territory, something that has not happened since August 2014.  The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 364 points, or 2.2%, to 16,151, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 159 points, or 3.4%, to 4,526. This deepened the New York stock exchange\u2019s already worst start to a year on record. Wednesday\u2019s stock market declines were triggered by new figures showing US gasoline stockpiles had increased to record high, which caused Brent crude prices to fall as low as $29.96, their lowest level since April 2004, before settling at $30.31, a 1.8% fall. The oil price has fallen by 73% since a peak of $115 reached in the summer of 2014. Industry data showed that US gasoline inventories soared by 8.4m barrels and stocks of diesel and heating oil increased by more than 6m barrels \u2013 confirming the forecasts of many analysts that a huge oversupply of oil could keep prices low during most of 2016. Analysts said that growing fears of a weakening outlook for the global economy, made worse by falling oil prices, was behind the steep falls. Some oil analysts this week predicted that the price could fall as low as $10.    Related: China sees 'many challenges' in 2016 as trade slumps on weak external demand    In recent days several analysts have warned that the global economy could suffer a repeat of the 2008 crash if the knock-on effects of a contraction in Chinese output pushes down commodity prices further and sparks panic selling on stock and bond markets. Amid the turmoil, a $48bn bond offer by brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev \u2013 to fund its takeover of SAB Miller \u2013 attracted a record $110bn of offers as investors sought relatively safe investments. Earlier in the day China\u2019s stock market fell more than 2% after officials played down the significance of better-than-expected trade figures for December, saying exports could sink further before they find a floor. The numbers surprised the markets, where economists had been forecasting a much weaker reading. Traders were also cheered when the numbers were translated into the weakening local currency, the yuan, which showed exports reaching a record value in December, up 2% on the previous year. They appeared to offset gloomy predictions of a stock market rout in 2016 made by several investment bank analysts, including RBS\u2019s credit chief, Andrew Roberts. Roberts warned earlier this week of a possible 20% drop in stock markets and a period of turmoil that would knock the prospects for global GDP this year. His advice to investors was to sell everything except high quality bonds. China\u2019s stock market rallied almost 20 points initially, but comments by officials that weak demand for Chinese goods would continue to hurt the country\u2019s economy in 2016 sent the Shanghai composite down 2.4% by the end of the trading period to 2949.      A Chinese container port. China\u2019s latest trade figures initially provoked optimism on the markets, but economic officials played down their significance. Photograph: Yu Fangping/EPA    Some economists argued that the figures showed trade with China was beginning to stabilise after a year of contraction. Daniel Martin, an economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cChina\u2019s trade data support our view that, despite the turmoil in Chinese financial markets, there has not been a major deterioration in its economy in recent months. \u201cMeanwhile, another large trade surplus last month provides a cushion for the People\u2019s Bank in the face of soaring capital outflows.\u201d Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit said: \u201cChina\u2019s improved trade data in December will probably act to reassure global investors unnerved by the recent volatility in the country\u2019s financial and foreign exchange markets. \u201cThe data is in line with other indicators that suggest China\u2019s economy is stabilising on the back of sustained stimulus measures.\u201d The country\u2019s global trade surplus widened by 21% to $60bn in December. Over the whole year it was $594bn. The country\u2019s trade surplus in December with the European Union, its biggest trading partner, increased 36.8% to $15.6bn. The surplus with the US contracted 6% to $19.4bn.  Some analysts questioned the trade figures, saying they were suspiciously buoyant after an unexplained 10% surge in exports to Hong Kong. That rise meant that the former UK colony imported more from mainland China than the US. Iris Pang, a senior economist for Greater China at Natixis SA in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg that the increase in exports to Hong Kong and China\u2019s imports from the city probably indicated \u201cfake invoicing\u201d. The invoicing of China trade should be larger in December because of the wider gap between the onshore yuan and the offshore yuan traded in Hong Kong, she said.   Related: The perils of China's currency devaluation    Albert Edwards, an economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who has predicted that global stock markets will tumble this year, said moves by the Chinese authorities to devalue the yuan to boost exports would have profound consequences for the global economy. He said that despite a large trade surplus, the huge capital flight from China, as savers take their cash out of the country, was forcing the hand of regulators. \u201cI have always thought that in order to revive a spluttering Chinese economy, the authorities would have to devalue, but not just because an overvalued exchange rate was squeezing their manufacturing sector. \u201cInstead I felt that an overvalued exchange rate had steadily undermined competitiveness to the point that it had undermined the balance of payments. This was compounded last year by an accelerated capital outflow as anti-corruption measures intensified, and an unprecedented unwinding of dollar-denominated borrowings by Chinese corporates. All these factors have combined to take the Chinese balance of payments into deep deficit.\u201d Optimists also pointed to a rise in Chinese crude imports to a record 7.82m barrels in December, up more than 21% from November, as a reason to believe that China\u2019s ailing manufacturing sector was gearing up for better days. It appeared, however, that the world\u2019s second-biggest oil consumer was simply taking advantage of the oil price rout to stock reserves and increase exports of refined products.", "tags": ["Oil", "Chinese economy", "Commodities", "China", "Global economy", "Asia Pacific", "Economics", "World news", "Business", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-13T22:15:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/15/chieck-tiote-move-shanghai-shenhue", "sentences": ["Cheik Tiot\u00e9 has travelled to China to complete a potential \u00a38m transfer from Newcastle United to Shanghai Shenhua, with Steve McClaren hoping the midfielder agrees a move that would release the funds needed to help him sign a new striker.", "Cheik\u2019s just going out there to have a chat with them and see how that ends up.\u201d   Related: Jonjo Shelvey signs for Newcastle in \u00a312m transfer from Swansea    The 29-year-old has been offered a three-year contract believed to be worth about \u00a370,000 a week and will join the former Newcastle and Chelsea striker Demba Ba in Shanghai."], "title": "Newcastle see Cheik Tiot\u00e9\u2019s potential \u00a38m Shanghai fee funding a striker", "article": "Cheik Tiot\u00e9 has travelled to China to complete a potential \u00a38m transfer from Newcastle United to Shanghai Shenhua, with Steve McClaren hoping the midfielder agrees a move that would release the funds needed to help him sign a new striker. \u201cHe\u2019s currently on his way to China to meet them,\u201d Newcastle\u2019s manager said. \u201cBut nothing has been finalised, nothing has been agreed.

Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images    FIVER LETTERS \u201cI awoke on Thursday morning to the news of Charlton appointing a new manager. The board and chairman were no doubt shamed into action by Wednesday\u2019s Fiver. This got me thinking that The Fiver\u2019s constant badgering and belittling probably also contributed to the recent major turnarounds in the football world such as the fall of Uncle Sepp, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger signing a player in January and Manchester United doing goals on Tuesday evening. Maybe this means we can look forward to Arsenal getting past the round of Arsenal in Big Cup, and a knack-free summer for Daniel Sturridge. Or maybe not.

The incompetency is even worse than advertised. In the Lawro league table v the real league table, Leicester, Watford and West Ham are indeed predicted as 17th, 18th and 19th, respectively. But look at the points differentials. He states that he is \u2018only\u2019 15, nine and 13 points out for each, respectively. A look at the real table will quickly show that he is in fact 25, 19 and 23 points wrong from the real table. Not usually one to complain, Lawro\u2019s perpetually condescending attitude actually drove me to write to the BBC through their website asking them to correct the errors, twice. As yet they have failed to do so. Your assistance in helping expose Lawro as a full one-eyed half-wit rather than semi one-eyed half-wit would be greatly appreciated\u201d \u2013 Mike Johns. \u201cTo Jim Butler (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), who can\u2019t fathom why being beaten at the near post is an inexcusable crime for a goalkeeper. I bet you\u2019re one of those who, when it\u2019s your turn in goal at five-a-side, just stands slap bang in the middle of the goal, right on the line, and flicks a feeble foot out at any shot that heads your way \u2013 missing the majority by miles because you don\u2019t understand why a goalkeeper should have to, you know, move and stuff. And then you wonder why everybody shouts at you\u201d \u2013 Anthony Schia. \u201cI could have explained to Jim Butler through mere words why getting caught at the near post is such a crime, but instead I thought I\u2019d get some use out of the Subbuteo set I got as a wedding present four years ago and haven\u2019t used since.

Our dear mum, aged 96, is recuperating in a care home after fracturing an ankle and may not get back to her own home. So we found ourselves sitting on the carpet with a box of stuff saved by my father \u2013 indentures and wills going back to the 1850s; letters by great-grandparents of whom I knew nothing; photos of people I can\u2019t even recognise. All of which only underlines how little I know beyond my paternal grandfather, the only grandparent I remember. The truth is, I never bothered that much with our family history: Welsh builders, Pennine craftsmen and Cumbrian farmers, who all came together in Victorian Lancashire \u2013 that\u2019s as much as I know. Our family memories were all much more recent: Dunkirk, the Med and Berlin, the Manchester blitz and Haslar hospital on D-Day. Three generations back and a couple forward was as much as I thought I wanted \u2013 or needed \u2013 to know. Then I met the Qin family. It all came about through a book by Frank Ching. It\u2019s called Ancestors, the tale of a Chinese family over 1,000 years. It is a story of roots, lost and found; of a family cast to the four winds by the Japanese invasion, the civil war, and the revolution; a family of rightists and leftists, glamour on the Shanghai stage and even a hero of the Long March. As soon as I started planning a television series on China, I knew this 1,000-year-old family had to be part of it, so I emailed Frank in Hong Kong: \u201cI\u2019d love to meet the family.\u201d Rebecca, the series producer, and I then went to Wuxi, in eastern China, where the main branch of the family lives. For me, it was all jaw-dropping after so many years away. I had first travelled here in the 80s when the industrial cities were dreary and people still wore blue Mao suits and rode cycles. Now, as the high-speed train whooshed through flatlands past neighbouring Suzhou at 300kph, I could see a new age had arrived: the \u201cin-flight\u201d videos, the jolly, helpful staff, fellow travellers all ready to chat, brimming with self-confident bonhomie, comfortable in their skins. Evening was coming on as we pulled into Wuxi; through the window we could see the bright lights of the skyscrapers, and the ceaseless traffic on the Grand Canal. It\u2019s a middling town by Chinese standards, but bigger than any city in Europe, apart from London. At first sight, you might think it all new, but it\u2019s as old as Rome. We were met by a beaming Qin Baoxin, his daughter Jenny and her husband, Frank. They took us through town in a brand new four-wheel drive, past shops selling Armani and Dior, and then dropped us off at a swish hotel on Lake Tai. In the top bar a pianist sang Cole Porter; outside, shimmering, lay the new China. Next day, they showed us around the old town, the family garden, and their old ancestral hall now dwarfed by towering office blocks. Then, out in the woods on the mountain overlooking Lake Tai, they took us to the grave of their ancestor, an 11th-century poet, Qin Guan. The site had been vandalised in the Cultural Revolution and then lost, but in the 80s Frank and his sister had travelled from Hong Kong in search of their roots and it had been rediscovered. \u201cThe family have tried to make it lovely,\u201d said Jenny, \u201cwe have planted trees and laid out paths and every April we come here at the time of the Qingming festival to tidy the grave, and make the report to the ancestors.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of report?\u201d \u201cWe tell them how we are doing and how they still live on in us \u2013 it\u2019s called Tomb-Sweeping Day.\u201d Well, of course, being filmmakers, we asked if we could come back to film Tomb-Sweeping Day and Baoxin immediately said yes. When festival time came, Wuxi\u2019s Canal Grand hotel was booked out as hundreds of family members converged from all over China. The day dawned with thick mist over damp, green hills above Lake Tai. On steep paths through the forested hillside, everyone wound their way carrying long-stemmed white chrysanthemums, red silk mourning sashes glinting in the low sun. Baoxin marshalled everyone in the glade where they bowed, laid flowers and recited prayers: a family reunited.     In the green hills above Lake Tai \u2026 Qin family members honouring their ancestors on Tomb Sweeping Day. Photograph: Mick Duffield    Then the oldest family member stood at the grave and spoke directly to the ancestor. The custom, banned under Mao, goes back to ancient times. It affirms the continuing presence of the ancestors in the lives of the living, with beautiful words based on Zhu Xi\u2019s\u00a012th-century Family Rituals, China\u2019s most influential book after the\u00a0writings of Confucius \u2013 you could find it in every house in the 19th century: \u201cWe the family stand here earnestly and respectfully repaying our\u00a0roots.\u201d As he watched, Hong Kong Frank scratched his head: \u201cI never dreamed this could happen again when I started my own journey of discovery, but for the Chinese the family is at the very heart of things: it tells us who we are.\u201d The long marcher\u2019s daughter chipped in: \u201cOur family has seen much over the 900 years \u2013 the family is the story of China in miniature.\u201d And China has been through so much, culminating in the horrors of the great famine, in which some say 30 million died, and then the Cultural Revolution, when Chinese culture was wrecked. \u201cWe went through hard times,\u201d said Baoxin, \u201cbut now, like everyone in China, we are asking what are our roots?\u201d The answer for him, as for most Chinese people lies in the family; they have found again the warmth of home.     Photocall \u2026 hundreds of Qin family members come to Wuxi\u2019s Canal Grand Hotel on Tomb Sweeping Day. Photograph: Mick Duffield    That evening we were invited to a huge, noisy dinner with speeches and toasts fuelled by Baoxin\u2019s special \u201cQin Family Banquet Spirit\u201d. Comfortably glowing in the welcoming bosom of the family, I found myself reflecting on Tomb-Sweeping Day. We call it ancestor worship, as if in some way it is superstition, but what I saw with the Qin family was a spiritual idea. It\u2019s about a living chain that connects the past with the present, the current generations with previous ones, in a society where the collective is set above the individual. Frank mailed me again just before Xmas. In the Yangzhou paper a new discovery: a stone inscription that takes the family back five more generations from Qin Guan. And as for me, well, I\u2019ve become more curious about those Woods from Greenfield, and Dad\u2019s precious documents box under the bed. Every year at Christmas my mum has raised a glass and recited a toast from a play she acted in as a teenager: \u201cThe family, that dear octopus from whose tentacles we never quite escape, nor in our innermost hearts never quite wish to \u2026\u201d Or as they say in China: \u201cA harmonious family is the root of all good things \u2026 Gambai!

The grand Mussolini-era barracks are shuttered; the weeds won their battle with the concrete some time ago. But amid the crumbling masonry, there is an incongruously neat little building, shaded behind a line of flags, with smartly outfitted security men behind its glass doors. This is Nato\u2019s Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). As one battleship after another has been removed from what remains of the Italian navy, and the base is wound down, the centre is preparing for a new kind of marine warfare amid the wreckage of the old. In a line of workshops along the quay, technicians tinker at the innards of the next generation of naval weapons. They may look like large bright yellow torpedoes, but they are in fact underwater drones, capable of being remote controlled on the surface and taking autonomous actions in the deep. Several will be able to stay submerged for months, eventually for years, only surfacing to report an encounter with an enemy submarine. The CMRE at La Spezia is not alone in this field. It has far bigger, better funded \u2013 and much more secretive \u2013 counterparts in the US, Russia and China. But the technicians here insist they are working on the state of the art.     The Nato research vessel Alliance. Photograph: CMRE    Marco, a wiry Italian-American in jeans and a white T-shirt (he cannot give his surname for security reasons), was working at a US Navy robotics workshop in Connecticut when he was seconded to La Spezia. He had never heard of CMRE and was surprised by what he found. In their laid-back, Mediterranean manner, the small mixed team of specialists on the Ligurian coast between Genoa and Pisa have made some striking advances. \u201cNo one knew what was going on here. They were very quiet about it,\u201d Marco says. \u201cBecause it is smaller, with a tight group of people from across Nato, there is far less red tape.\u201d Marco is working on a partially disassembled robot on a trestle, its innards laid out on a bench in a row: motor, on-board computer and sonar equipment. The basic model is made by Florida Atlantic University for research and oil rigs; Marco and his team take these apart and improve them, giving them new propellers and batteries that allow them to stay submerged for longer, and a computerised brain that will enable them to hunt for submarines in deep water. For half a century, big missile submarines, known as boomers, have been arguably the most decisive weapon systems in modern warfare \u2013 the queen on the strategic chessboard \u2013 because of their capacity to remain unseen until the critical moment, unleashing enormous destructive force without warning. Now that dominant position is under threat. A submarine can hide from a few noisily obvious ships and planes, but it is harder to hide from a swarm of small, virtually undetectable drones. The robots being developed here can potentially be made cheap and expendable, and capable of being deployed in large numbers to cover vast expanses of sea. Once fully developed, they could tilt the balance of power beneath the waves \u2013 much as airborne drones are already doing in the sky. It is unclear how far other countries have got with underwater drone technology; it is known that the Russian navy is working on it intensively.     An engineer on the Nato research vessel Alliance. Photograph: CMRE    The implications of these advances are far-reaching for all military powers, but none more so than the UK, which depends on the invisibility and stealth of submarines for its Trident nuclear missiles. The government is in the process of placing a \u00a331bn gamble that its submarines will stay invisible for the foreseeable future \u2013 a bet that might be splitting the Labour party but is little debated outside it. Yet these developments could drastically change the debate: from whether an independent British nuclear deterrent is good, bad or necessary, to whether Trident would even function as a deterrent in the long term. *** Hovering above all this is arguably the biggest threat of all \u2013 cyber warfare: the great wild card that can turn the world\u2019s most advanced technology against itself with a few well-placed lines of code. In a hotel in the Estonian capital Tallinn, 400 soldiers and civilians are taking part in Nato\u2019s biggest ever cyber war game, Locked Shields. At ranks of computer screens, young men with crew cuts in camouflage fatigues sit interspersed with teams of male and female hackers in green and yellow T-shirts, most in their early 20s, many with piercings and tattoos. In a separate conference room, a team of hackers in red T-shirts are sequestered away. They have researched the latest cyber weapons in circulation on the darknet and are throwing them at competing teams taking part here and remotely, from various Nato capitals and bases. The aim, says Colonel Artur Suzik, the Estonian army officer who is the game\u2019s host, is \u201cto put these people under stress\u201d.     The green team at Locked Shields, Nato\u2019s biggest ever cyber war game. Photograph: Henrik Duncker for the Guardian    Estonia learned the importance of cyber defence the hardest way possible. In 2007, it became the target of the first concerted state-on-state cyber attack, when Moscow decided to show the small former Soviet republic that it was still under Russia\u2019s shadow. The assault unfolded in late April and early May. The servers of the country\u2019s banks were hacked, forcing them to close down all but essential operations, and move to proxy servers in Lithuania. Without a shot being fired, a nation\u2019s entire financial infrastructure was forced into exile. At the same time, mass text messages were sent from an anonymous source to Estonia\u2019s Russian-speaking minority, telling them to drive very slowly through the city centre at a certain time of day. The drivers kept moving, so technically no crime was committed, but it brought Tallinn to a virtual standstill. Then the telephone numbers of vital government services all started ringing at once, nonstop, as they were swamped by robot calls. It was a frightening early display of the vulnerability of modern societies to this new form of aggression. It was also an example of what has now become known as hybrid warfare, in which the dividing line between war and peace is blurred, and acts of war are shrouded in ambiguity and deniability. Since 2007, there has been a steady drip-drip of small probing attacks on Estonia, continuing at a low enough intensity so as to be absorbed into daily life. \u201cIt is a constant background noise,\u201d says Hillar Aarelaid, who was chief of Estonia\u2019s cyber defences in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s like being by the sea and hearing the waves.\u201d In anticipation of the next big attack, Nato\u2019s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence has been set up in Tallinn, and links have been established between the military and a civilian infrastructure. Most of the Estonian computer experts and hackers currently sitting in this hotel ballroom would be called up in a crisis.     Coloured strands show the game\u2019s changing patterns of attack. Photograph: Henrik Duncker for the Guardian    If the 2007 incident was destabilising, it now seems as rudimentary as a zeppelin attack. The weapons available to hackers today are far more sophisticated and powerful, menacing even the most heavily guarded networks. The Locked Shields exercise in Tallinn is designed to anticipate what the next onslaught might look like: a complex scenario in which an imaginary country, Berylia, which looks very like Estonia, comes under a surprise attack by both strategically placed explosives and an escalating cyber assault focused on its most sensitive industry, a drone manufacturer. The assailants are anonymous, but seem to be working for Berylia\u2019s bitter rival and neighbour, Crimsonia, an imaginary state that closely resembles Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. In a corner of the ballroom, a bank of large screens shows how the game is unfolding, a graphic portrayal of what a wired society looks like when it begins to break down in the face of a well-organised cyber offensive. Within a few hours, Berylia has lost control of all its drones. Their trajectories can be seen drifting around a map of the northern hemisphere on a screen on the wall. On another screen, what looks like a big ball of multicoloured electronic wool constantly rearranges itself. Each coloured strand represents a new computer connection being made; it is a shimmering picture of the battlefield, showing the ever-changing patterns of attack. A cyber security team from Nato headquarters in Belgium is eventually declared the winner, having built the most secure systems, and rebuilt them fastest. What we have seen in this ballroom is what warfare will look like in the future, Aarelaid tells me, standing by a row of tables offering a wide range of caffeinated drinks to keep the hackers awake and on edge. \u201cThe Arab spring started on the internet. This is the new reality. Everything from now on will be accompanied by cyber [warfare] or triggered by cyber.\u201d *** In an operations room at the Nato command compound in Mons, Belgium, is another bank of screens, this time depicting near-constant real-life attacks, in the form of red lines of data. Ian West, head of cyber security at Nato\u2019s Communications and Information Agency, puts the success of its team in the Locked Shields exercise down to the experience gleaned here. \u201cEvery single day, we are operational, experiencing attacks and defending against them,\u201d the former RAF officer says. West\u2019s agency logs around 200m suspicious events a week. Many of those are automatically discarded by filters, but that still leaves 250-350 serious cases each week against Nato HQ and bases around the world, each of them requiring intervention from the 200-strong multinational group of security analysts and programmers gathered here. There are many more attacks on the national infrastructures of member states. West is an enthusiastic collector of Napoleonic memorabilia and his office houses musket balls, tunic buttons and hat badges salvaged from the nearby battlefield at Waterloo. Yet the form of warfare he now pursues is further from these relics than Napoleon was from the swords and spears of the iron age. \u201cThis is largely an unseen war,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talk about different wars that might take place in the future \u2013 cyber attacks are something we are dealing with now. People hear about it only when something big happens, but it is because of this team, and others like it in other countries, that big things don\u2019t happen all the time.\u201d In the operations room, the red lines show the nature, location and persistence of each assault. A set of algorithms has eliminated the false alarms and insignificant attempts. Scanning the rest, security analysts look through the lines of code for patterns and vulnerabilities in the system. \u201cIf someone knocks on your door once, you think, \u2018That\u2019s annoying\u2019,\u201d says one of the analysts on duty. \u201cWhen they knock 10 times, then you wait for the bugger to come back to see what he\u2019s doing.\u201d     Ian West, head of Nato\u2019s Communications and Information Agency, in an operations room at its command compound in Mons, Belgium. Photograph: Emmanuel Fradin for the Guardian    Right now, the greatest constraint on Nato\u2019s ability to defend itself against attack is the scarcity of security specialists. The Russian and Chinese security establishments are known to have corralled networks of hackers. In China, the now infamous Unit 61398 of the People\u2019s Liberation Army was discovered, in 2013, to have been running an almost constant cyber-offensive against western companies and governments for seven years, from a 12-storey building in Shanghai; the offensive involved thousands of English-speaking hackers. A mass networked assault on Nato infrastructure from China two years ago is believed to have been the work of the same unit; more recently, there have been constant attacks on Nato from hacktivist groups such as CyberBerkut, backing Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine. \u201cMany people think of hacktivists as 16-year-old youths sitting in their bedroom,\u201d West says, \u201cand of course there are many like that. But when you put enough of them together and under the control of a few people who know what they are doing, they can become a formidable army.\u201d *** Bob is an ex-hacker in his late 20s with \u201cMiddle Eastern roots\u201d, and lives in London. This is as much as he will tell me about his background, since Bob (not his real name) does not want his identity revealed and will only speak to me over the phone, from an undisclosed location. A Nato recruit, Bob is, in his own words, \u201cfrom the darker side\u201d. \u201cWhen I was in my teens, I was cracking games and breaking into sites,\u201d he says. \u201cI was good at programming and I started wondering how to make a website do what you wanted it to do. There was a certain company that had games zones, and winners would get six months\u2019 supply of their products. I was bored and playing around, and I found a bug in the game. I gave the name and address of a neighbour, and a few days later I saw them deliver him six months of baby food.\u201d Ultimately, hacking became so easy that it stopped being fun; he also found that \u201cthe ethical side has a guaranteed paycheck every month, which is nice\u201d. First Bob did security work for banks, spotting vulnerabilities; then, in 2006, a friend told him about a Nato job.    As an alliance, Nato can only play defence    As an alliance, Nato can only play defence. It can hire experienced hackers to assess its systems\u2019 vulnerabilities, but only if they have gone through a recognised course and earned the unlikely sounding qualification of \u201ccertified ethical hacker\u201d. When Bob joined Nato, he did an interview over the phone and moved to Mons, where he led \u201cred team\u201d exercises against alliance defences, using the latest hacks being passed around the underground forums. \u201cIt was never nine to five,\u201d he says. \u201cI was online 20 hours a day, looking at forums to see what people are doing and what are the new threats. I worked with close incident response, figuring out attacks and learning how sites got compromised. It comes down to technique and instincts. You have to find someone who can deal with an incident under pressure, and not get paranoid and block access to normal people. The trouble with most industry and government agencies is that they don\u2019t work with the hackers. They need their skills but don\u2019t trust their own guys. They\u2019re scared of them.\u201d Drawing on Estonia\u2019s experience of 2007, the UK set up a Joint Cyber Reserve unit in 2013, which is intended to recruit hundreds of hackers as reservists, irrespective of whether they have been convicted of hacking offences. The aim is to sharpen the British military\u2019s ability to bolster its defences, identifying potential \u201ctrapdoors\u201d. The unit will also be involved for the first time in cyber attack, after the government indicated a willingness to strike back against intruders or even take pre-emptive action, compromising the networks used by terrorist groups such as Islamic State. Last year, a new unit was formed to further update the army\u2019s psychological operations. The 77th Brigade is modelled on the celebrated Chindits, second world war commandos who operated behind enemy lines in Burma to win over \u201chearts and minds\u201d. The commanding officer, Brigadier Alastair Aitken, intends to bring in creative figures from the arts, who know about constructing narratives, with the aim of countering jihadist recruitment and radicalisation online. Using social media, it has been dubbed the \u201cFacebook Brigade\u201d, but it is unclear how different it will be from traditional military propaganda. \u201cI don\u2019t think the army have quite got their head around this new battlefield,\u201d one military source says. \u201cThe scale of what needs to be done and what it has to change is way beyond what the 77th is meant to do.\u201d In the wake of criticisms that the UK\u2019s cyber fortifications are inadequate, George Osborne announced in November that the government would spend nearly \u00a32bn on cyber defence and establish a National Cyber Centre, led by GCHQ. As well as data collection, mass surveillance and monitoring terrorist threats, the UK is prepared to carry out offensive operations. Officials say these might include infecting and disconnecting enemy computers, or creating \u201creal world effects\u201d by targeting computer systems that control civilian infrastructure \u2013 the power grid, for instance.     Lieutenant Colonel Jens van Laak and Locked Shields\u2019 host, Colonel Artur Suzik. The war game\u2019s aim, he says, is to put people under stress. Photograph: Henrik Duncker    Meanwhile, the national defence debate remains focused on Trident. According to former defence secretary Des Browne, Britain has not even begun to make a comprehensive assessment of its vulnerability. \u201cWhen it comes to our strategic security, it appears that we are willing to bet the farm on having one undetectable and assuredly reliable nuclear armed submarine at all times,\u201d says Browne, now vice chairman of Nuclear Threat Initiative, an arms control advocacy group. He argues that Trident\u2019s effectiveness can no longer be taken for granted. \u201cCyber attacks are already able to undermine the reliability of our nuclear command, control and communications,\u201d he says. \u201cNo longer can we guarantee that the weapons will work as we designed them to do when we reach for them.\u201d Critics point in particular to the Royal Navy\u2019s decision to install a variant of Windows XP as the operating system on its missile-carrying Vanguard-class submarines. It was cheaper than the alternatives, but Windows for Submarines, as it is called, is also more vulnerable to malware as it comes off-the-shelf. This also means there are more bugs in circulation that could affect it, and every time a submarine comes to port and gets a software patch, it is newly vulnerable. But the Ministry of Defence insists that Trident \u201cremains safe and secure. Submarines operate in isolation by design, and this contributes to their cyber resilience. We take our responsibility to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent extremely seriously and continually assess the capability of our submarines to ensure their operational effectiveness, including against threats from cyber and unmanned vehicles.\u201d Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy officer now at Royal United Services Institute, tells me that British technicians are well aware of the potential software vulnerabilities and have instituted special safeguards. He says predictions of the submarine\u2019s demise as a stealth weapon are premature. \u201cNone of this anti-submarine technology has been perfected,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd what you are not able to do with drones is get them to work together, because of the problems of communications underwater. I can\u2019t see a breakthrough in the next 15 years, and you are never going to see the whole ocean. We are talking about a water space that covers two-thirds of the world\u2019s surface. This is not a needle in haystack. It\u2019s way beyond that.\u201d *** In La Spezia, the technicians are working on overcoming these current limitations. One is how to sustain autonomous robots under the sea for long periods, but that is close to being cracked, with combinations of solar and the power generated by a drone\u2019s descent through the water. The next big issue will be getting the drones to \u201csee\u201d and communicate through the oceans. Experiments are under way into laser-based techniques for finding objects underwater; for the time being, the lemon-coloured robots in La Spezia use sonar like their manned precursors. Operating in \u201cblue water\u201d, the open ocean, is a challenge, but Kevin LePage, the American principal scientist at CMRE, believes it is just a matter of time. \u201cI think it will be used in blue water. The technology is completely applicable.\u201d    The trouble with most industry and government agencies is they don't work with the hackers    His Portuguese colleague, Emanuel Coelho, adds that the capabilities of anti-submarine drones will be amplified by intelligence. Big submarines can be picked up in coastal water and then tracked by relays of drones and aircraft. \u201cSubmarine forces are getting very nervous,\u201d Coelho says, \u201cbecause they never know when they are being detected or not.\u201d The renewed Trident deterrent is not due to be in service until the early 2030s. By then, the oceans are almost certain to be swarming with anti-submarine drones from many rival powers, with far higher capabilities than the ones being trialled at La Spezia. \u201cTrident is old technology,\u201d says Paul Ingram, executive director of the British American Security Information Council, based in London and Washington DC. \u201cThe submarines are big, they\u2019re expensive, with very long lead times.

If you paused to contemplate this for a moment, you might think of all those Oyster cards tapping, all those doors sliding, all those people moving, consider whatever mad visionary first thought of demolishing houses to dig holes in the ground to put trains in, and conclude that a subterranean public transport network is a small miracle. Most of the time, though, commuters don\u2019t pause, and don\u2019t conclude anything of the sort. They have other things on their mind. To many of them, \u201ca small miracle\u201d might seem more like a description of their journey to work than of the system that facilitates it. In the execution of their own daily miracles, London\u2019s commuters have learned to withstand vast and unpredictable challenges: track closures; signal failures; engineering works. And they have developed a thick skin. But on that particular Friday, the 11,000 of them who got off at Holborn station between 8.30 and 9.30am faced an unusually severe provocation. As they turned into the concourse at the bottom of the station\u2019s main route out and looked up, they saw something frankly outrageous: on the escalators just ahead of them, dozens of people were standing on the left.   Related: Looming London transport crisis 'risks sparking riots', says TfL chief    We might be bad at dancing and expressing our feelings, but say this for the British: when we settle on a convention of public order, we bloody well stick to it. We wait in line. We leave the last biscuit. And when we take the escalator, we stand on the right. The left is reserved for people in a hurry. In Washington DC, those who block the way are known as \u201cescalumps\u201d; here, they can expect the public humiliation of a tutting sound just over their shoulder. \u201cPassengers just don\u2019t like having these things changed,\u201d says Celia Harrison, a Transport for London (TfL) customer strategy analyst, and one of the key people responsible for this heretical deviation from the norm. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on stations for many years. So I was aware that whatever we did people weren\u2019t going to be comfortable about having their routine disturbed.\u201d The idea had come about after Len Lau, Vauxhall area manager, had gone to Hong Kong on holiday. Lau noticed that passengers on that city\u2019s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) were standing calmly on both sides of the escalator and, it seemed, travelling more efficiently and safely as a result. His report prompted Harrison and her colleagues to wonder whether the same effect would apply at a station such as Holborn, and so they set about arranging a three-week trial. The theory, if counterintuitive, is also pretty compelling. Think about it. It\u2019s all very well keeping one side of the escalator clear for people in a rush, but in stations with long, steep walkways, only a small proportion are likely to be willing to climb. In lots of places, with short escalators or minimal congestion, this doesn\u2019t much matter. But a 2002 study of escalator capacity on the Underground found that on machines such as those at Holborn, with a vertical height of 24 metres, only 40% would even contemplate it. By encouraging their preference, TfL effectively halves the capacity of the escalator in question, and creates significantly more crowding below, slowing everyone down. When you allow for the typical demands for a halo of personal space that persist in even the most disinhibited of commuters \u2013 a phenomenon described by crowd control guru Dr John J Fruin as \u201cthe human ellipse\u201d, which means that they are largely unwilling to stand with someone directly adjacent to them or on the first step in front or behind - the theoretical capacity of the escalator halves again. Surely it was worth trying to haul back a bit of that wasted space.   tube escalator passenger flow infographic   Paul Stoneman, one of Harrison\u2019s colleagues, did some preliminary calculations. In theory, he found, getting people to stand on both sides would mean that 31 more passengers would get on to the escalator each minute \u2013 an increase of 28%. Holborn seemed like the perfect test case, not only for the rake of its escalators, but also for its rush-hour stampede: \u201cWhen you come round the corner and see this throng,\u201d says Stoneman, \u201cyou just go, blinking flip, I don\u2019t want to use this station, it\u2019s a nightmare. It\u2019s like Bank.\u201d But success was by no means a given: as Lau also noted, commuters in Hong Kong are vastly different to British ones. In a wash-up meeting to analyse the results of the trial a few weeks after it was completed, Stoneman asked the dozen people in the room: \u201cHow many years have we been saying, \u2018stand on the right\u2019? It\u2019s quite a significant behaviour to change.\u201d Hard though it might be, changing how commuters behave is an ever more important part of a barrage of efforts to increase the capacity of the Tube, efforts that draw in equal parts on social psychology and fluid dynamics: the best model for the movement of a crowd through a warren of tunnels is the movement of a torrent of water through pipes. London is growing faster than any other European city; its population of 8.6 million is expected to hit 10 million by 2030. The London Infrastructure Plan 2050 predicts demand on the system to rise by 60%. And so TfL has to extract every last ounce of capacity from its underground network, the oldest in the world. A 1928 poster on display at the London Transport Museum and TfL headquarters charts the flux in passengers through the day - \u201cThe Workers\u201d, \u201cThe Businessman\u201d, \u201cThe Shoppers and Pleasure-Seekers\u201d \u2013 and adds them up to a hefty 1.1 million, a total so large that the copywriter boasts: \u201cWALK IN AND SEE THE SHOW/ NEVER A DULL MOMENT IF YOU TRAVEL UNDERGROUND.\u201d That mass of people was still less than a quarter the size of last year\u2019s average load.     A 1928 poster describing the daily flux of passengers on the London Underground. Photograph: TfL/London Transport Museum    To keep up with that growth, huge investment is needed, and major works are nearly always being carried out: as the Holborn trial went on, the \u00a3500m upgrade of Tottenham Court Road was being completed one stop away. In a system operating so close to capacity, the obedience of its users is also vital. \u201cIf everybody wasn\u2019t so compliant in their journey,\u201d says Stoneman, \u201cit would be a fistfight down there.\u201d And so, with so much at stake, decisions to wind up commuters are not taken lightly: there is serious analysis behind them. The stand-on-the-left controversy is no exception. Harrison, Stoneman and their colleagues believe it could make a noticeable impact on congestion at some of London\u2019s busiest stations, congestion that will only get worse as train design, frequency and reliability improve, as the trains get faster and the doors get bigger, and ever more passengers are dumped on the platform at a time. \u201cFrom my point of view,\u201d says TfL\u2019s head of transport planning Geoff Hobbs, \u201cthe ideal train would look like a bread bin\u201d. In order to make their plan work, they had to be ingenious \u2013 and persuasive. \u201cOriginally, we thought enforcement might be a good idea,\u201d Harrison told colleagues at the wash-up, \u201cas in people standing on the left in uniform, so that people couldn\u2019t walk past them. But after concerns about possible assaults were raised, we decided it wasn\u2019t that good of an idea. So we went for encouragement.\u201d That meant teams of staff standing at the bottom of the escalators with loudhailers, asking commuters, as cheerfully as possible, if they would mind standing on both sides. It mean plain-clothes \u201cplants\u201d \u2013 \u201cgreat, big lift engineers,\u201d according to Stoneman \u2013 being sent up the escalators to block the way for others and create a new sort of social pressure. It even meant asking amenable couples to hold hands across the escalator, the better to thwart those who wished to slalom through the line. Harrison is a 16-year veteran of the Underground, and even if she mostly cycles herself, she loves it, above all for the people. For the best part of two decades, she has absorbed everything a global city can throw at her \u2013 from the mundane intensity of rush hour to the seismic shock of the 7/7 attacks, when, as station supervisor at Aldgate, it fell to her to call for ambulances after the bomb went off. Through it all, she says, she has remained an optimist, and perhaps she has a better sense of perspective than most. Last month, as she stood on the concourse with all those good ideas up her sleeve and watched the trial unfold, she was a little unprepared for the intensity of the reaction, let alone for the interest of newspapers such as Denmark\u2019s Politiken or the Washington Post. During the three weeks of the Holborn project, those who disapproved of the idea voiced their opinions with alacrity, as a preliminary internal report diligently records. There were plenty who didn\u2019t seem to hate it, too \u2013 but they were rather quieter.     \u2018It\u2019s quite a significant behaviour to change\u2019 \u2026 says Paul Stoneman, pictured with fellow TfL strategic planner Celia Harrison at Holborn station in London. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    \u201cThis is a charter for the lame and lazy!\u201d said one. \u201cI know how to use a bloody escalator!\u201d said another. The pilot was \u201cterrible\u201d, \u201cloopy,\u201d \u201ccrap\u201d, \u201cridiculous\u201d, and a \u201cvery bad idea\u201d; in a one-hour session, 18 people called it \u201cstupid\u201d. A customer who was asked to stand still replied by giving the member of staff in question the finger. One man, determined to stride to the top come what may, pushed a child to one side. \u201cCan\u2019t you let us walk if we want to?\u201d asked another. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Russia!\u201d It is not yet clear whether a Putinesque future awaits us. If the stand-on-the-left experiment is to be adopted permanently at Holborn, and potentially be extended to other comparable stations, it will have to get through more testing and analysis. What could politely be termed \u201ccustomer feedback\u201d has already led the team to conclude that it would be wise to keep at least one escalator running conventionally. But the preliminary evidence is clear: however much some people were annoyed, Lau\u2019s hunch was right. It worked. Through their own observations and the data they gathered, Harrison and her team found strong evidence to back their case. An escalator that carried 12,745 customers between 8.30 and 9.30am in a normal week, for example, carried 16,220 when it was designated standing only. That didn\u2019t match Stoneman\u2019s theoretical numbers: it exceeded them.   Related: Overcrowded and getting busier: why new train lines can't come fast enough for London    These results, you might imagine, would be enough to see the model introduced instantly at any station where the escalator was sufficiently steep to discourage people from walking up. But there\u2019s a problem: those damn commuters. With the constant (and unsustainable) attention of staff, and three weeks of practice, they eventually became a little more docile, and followed the new regime, satisfying themselves, as the report puts it, with a \u201cgreat deal of non-verbal communication in the form of head-shaking\u201d. The following week, they immediately went back to normal. And so another trial is under discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s like child psychology,\u201d says Stoneman, a father. \u201cIt takes four days to get your kid to go to bed and do what it\u2019s supposed to do, and it takes one day for them to stay up, and you\u2019re sitting there banging your head against the wall again.\u201d So if you can\u2019t tell them what to do every two minutes, how on earth do you get them to comply? At the wash-up meeting in the faded grandeur of TfL\u2019s office at St James\u2019 Park station, this question was the subject of careful scrutiny. The next trial, if it happens, will focus on one escalator alone; it will investigate whether customers can be persuaded to stand without loudhailer-brandishing staff to monitor them. The handrail and tread of the escalator will be a different colour, and firmly planted pairs of feet will decorate the left of the steps. In lieu of actual people, a hologram customer service operative will remind people to stand on both sides. Then there\u2019s the question of exactly what the hologram should say. Some argued for an appeal to altruism. Said Stoneman: \u201cIf the understanding is, we\u2019re doing this for the greater good, people will comply.\u201d Then it was pointed out that in the run-up to the Olympics, when everyone was panicking that the Tube would be hopelessly oversubscribed, the team tasked with encouraging people to take alternative routes had hit on the opposite insight: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about saying you\u2019re taking one for team London,\u201d said communications manager James Grant. \u201cIt was about saying, you\u2019re benefiting from the journey yourself.\u201d So what\u2019s the slogan? Stoneman cast around for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a perception of being held back, but you\u2019re not really,\u201d he said. \u201cSo \u2026 this is benefiting you, your individual time is reduced, but you are relinquishing the right, if you wish to, of walking on this escalator.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cRight,\u201d said Grant Dyer, another of the report\u2019s co-authors. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to make that snappier.\u201d     The London Infrastructure Plan 2050 predicts demand on the system will rise by 60%, so TfL needs to extract every last ounce of capacity from the network. Photograph: Tolga Akmen/Anadolu/Getty Images    Perhaps it\u2019s a shame that the appeal to altruism tends to prove less effective, but Harrison doesn\u2019t find it terribly surprising. \u201cPeople would be shocked if they knew how complicated the whole system is,\u201d she says, a week or so after the meeting. \u201cHow difficult it is to run a service every two minutes, and control crowding, and work around equipment failures.\u201d Since she started on the tube herself, she has amended one important bit of her commuting etiquette: she doesn\u2019t run for trains as the doors close any more. \u201cOn the Jubilee line, if they have to reopen the door because you\u2019re caught, that\u2019s a 30-second delay. And then you have a gap in front, and a knock-on effect, and it gets bigger and bigger, and before you know it, there\u2019s a five-minute delay going through central London. But I was in the habit, and it took me a good month or so to stop myself doing it. How are you going to stop the customers who don\u2019t even understand?\u201d And yet, recalcitrant though commuters can be, Harrison retains a faith in their reason when it really counts. She remembers how they left the station after the bomb went off at Aldgate: \u201cIt was one of the most striking aspects of the day. People doing exactly what we asked them to do, which was leave \u2013 really calmly, completely unselfishly, helping each other. And this quality of silence.\u201d On any given morning at Holborn, the atmosphere is, happily, almost the exact opposite. And perhaps that tumult is the price and the pleasure of living in a great city. Do Londoners have it in their nature to stand on the left? It\u2019s too early to say. Change is hard. Still, as I arrived on a Victoria line platform shortly after speaking with Harrison, and I heard the tell-tale beep of a train getting ready to depart, I surprised myself. I didn\u2019t try to squeeze aboard. Another one, after all, will be along in a minute. The world underground The standing to the right rule, first promoted in Britain, is not mirrored all over the world: Shanghai residents take a strictly optional approach; Australia is a notable rogue, preferring escalator users to stand to the left; and the rules are different in different Japanese cities (left in Tokyo; right in Osaka). Escalator users in Hong Kong and Japan have seen campaigns encouraging them to stand on both sides of the escalator: \u201cLet\u2019s All Grab a Handrail,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t walk. Stand where you like.\u201d But results have been mixed \u2013 etiquette seems still to be trumping rules. Leaving your paper behind on the train in London might be seen as a courtesy, but in Vienna it\u2019s not the done thing \u2013 authorities are actively encouraging people to adhere to this piece of etiquette with signs and announcements. In Japan it\u2019s considered polite to switch your phone to \u201cManner Mode\u201d (an excellent way of describing what we might think of as \u201csilent\u201d) when using the metro, so that other passengers aren\u2019t subjected to ringtones galore as they travel. Eating durian fruit, considered the world\u2019s smelliest, is a terrible faux pas on Singapore\u2019s MRT, and has been banned by authorities \u2013 \u201cno durian\u201d signs have been posted around the network. It\u2019s considered bad manners to sit in priority seats in Seoul subway carriages at any time, regardless of whether there\u2019s anyone around who needs them \u2013 you can expect multiple chiding looks.

Statistically it was a remarkable event \u2013 it was just Tomic\u2019s second career victory over a top 10 player in an official ATP match, and his first in nearly two years.  For all his undeniable talent and the promise that he showed during a run to the Wimbledon quarter-finals at the tender age of just 18, until that moment in the desert oasis, for seven years on the ATP tour Tomic had struggled against the game\u2019s elite players. Yet after string of encouraging recent results, he heads into this year\u2019s Australian Open harbouring hopes of becoming a top 10 player himself. Roger Federer may not share his confidence, but since that win over Ferrer, Tomic has begun to turn the tide of defeats.  As 2015 progressed, it began to improve. First came a victory over Marin Cilic on the fast hard courts in Toronto, and later in the year there were wins against Richard Gasquet and again Ferrer, this time in Shanghai.   Related: Bernard Tomic upsets Kei Nishikori to reach Brisbane International semis    Continuing the trend, last week at the Brisbane International Tomic produced his first win in an official ATP match against a top 10 player on Australian soil; 6-3,1-6, 6-3 against Kei Nishikori. Tomic, now ranked 17 in the world, is seeded 16th at the Australian Open and he arrives at Melbourne Park with a record of seven wins and 32 losses against the current top 10. Yet he is still winless in 14 matches against the big four, and of the current top 15, he holds a positive win-loss ratio against just one of them: Kevin Anderson. He is 0-5 against Novak Djokovic (1-5 if you count the Hopman Cup win in 2013, which the ATP doesn\u2019t), 0-4 against Tomas Berdych and 0-3 against Rafael Nadal, Federer and Andy Murray, the last of whom he could face in the fourth round of this Australian Open. He is 1-1 against Stan Wawrinka, though his win against the Swiss player came on grass, in Australia, in 2011 when Wawrinka was ranked outside the top 15. The fact remains: if he is to reach his goal of mingling with the best in the world at the top of the rankings, he must start scoring wins against the big names at the big tournaments. But with his form rapidly trending upward \u2013 with four wins and eight losses against the top 10 since and including that against Ferrer in March \u2013 the signs are promising. There is no disputing that 2015 was a very good year for him. Tomic finished 2013 at 51 in the rankings, 2014 at 78 and 2015 at a career high of 18. His win-loss record for 2015 was 40-27, and 26-12 on hard courts. Those latter figures on what is clearly his favourite surface represent the kind of form that would put him into the top 10. It was also almost certainly no coincidence it all happened after Tony Roche joined his team as a part-time consultant and mentor. More specifically, Tomic needs to break into the semi-finals of a few Masters 1000 events and/or make at least one Grand Slam quarter-final to make up the big points gap required to jump inside the top 10. This is why, bar a freakishly kind draw at one of these tournaments, he must start to score some wins against the game\u2019s elite.  When examining his prospects of actually achieving this, it is revealing to note the other players from outside the top 10 who have the best records against the best players; Andersen (who beat Murray and Wawrinka last year); 25-year-old Milos Raonic, now back at number 14 in the world, beat Nadal, Nishikori, Murray, Berdych in 2015 and Federer just last week; Grigor Dimitrov, just a year older than Tomic, who despite having a surprisingly poor year in 2015, managed wins against Wawrinka, Berdych, Murray, and Djokovic; then an outlier in Ivo Karlovic, the 36-year-old, 208cm Croat, who beat Tsonga, Berdych and Djokovic.  And yes, you did see a pattern there \u2013 it\u2019s the players with the powerful, explosive, weapons-grade games who score the big wins over the big players. The rallying, counter-punchers rarely, if ever, do. This raises questions about whether it\u2019s movement, attitude or quite simply power that Tomic needs to work on in order to take his place among the best. Joining Federer (\u201cmany seasons in a row now we have seen or heard that top 10 is the goal and he\u2019s missed out on it by a long shot\u201d) as a sceptic on Tomic\u2019s top 10 prospects was his former coach Neil Guiney, who told News Corp, \u201cBernard\u2019s light-years away from say, Djokovic,\u201d before adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a bit late at maturing \u2026 he\u2019s at an age where he should be knocking on the door of the top 10.\u201d Former pro Goran Ivanisevic has also added: \u201cI always said that Bernard is a guy who should be top 10 a long time ago\u2026 He is such a talented player\u201d. It\u2019s hard to believe but Tomic is still just 23 years old and doesn\u2019t turn 24 until October, making him the youngest player currently ranked inside the top 17. Also, his unorthodox game was probably always going to take a little longer to find its feet. But of the current top 10 all but two had already reached those heights by the time they were 23. Some hope: fellow tour young guns Raonic and Dimitrov reached the top 10 for the first time at age 23 while American John Isner, currently ranked 11, didn\u2019t break through until he was 27 years old. Tomic is not alone in this struggle. Top 30 player Jack Sock is also 23 and has a similarly poor record to Tomic against the best, though interestingly he leads Tomic 3-0 in head-to-head. 22-year-old Dominic Thiem (ranked 20) has never registered a single win against a top 10 player, nor has 22 year old world No42 Jiri Vesely. All while 19-year-old Borna Coric, like 20-year-old Nick Kyrgios, has already scored a couple of wins over the Big Four. Tomic has placed a lot of emphasis on earning his 16th seed at the Australian Open, though being seeded 16 rather 17 or 18 doesn\u2019t necessarily help him all that much, bar missing a third round match with a player seeded between 9 and 16, perhaps Tsonga, Raonic or Isner. Instead he will now be drawn to face a player ranked between 17 and 24 in the third round, with potential match-ups against Gael Monfils (now that would be a cracking first week match), Viktor Troicki or Karlovic.  Should Tomic progress past the third round he will face Murry in the fourth round so confronts the possibility of an early end to his campaign like against Berdych in 2015, Nadal in 2014 and 2011, and Federer in 2013 and 2012. He did not win a set in any of those encounters. All that said, the statistical prospects of Tomic progressing past the fourth round of this Australian Open remain relatively slim and so the likelihood he\u2019ll break into the top 10 within the next few months is too. The recent upswing in his results is promising but in order for his top 10 dream to become a reality, it\u2019s going to take a big scalp or two.", "tags": ["Bernard Tomic", "Tennis", "Australian Open 2016", "Australian Open", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-16T19:30:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/16/winter-smog-hits-worlds-cities-air-pollution-soars", "sentences": ["However, away from big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai pollution is still bad."], "title": "Air pollution: a dark cloud of filth poisons the world\u2019s cities", "article": "During these cold winter days, Anumita Choudhury dare not leave her small second-floor apartment in Delhi\u2019s northern suburbs.

The story is the same in many of the world\u2019s great cities. From Kabul in Afghanistan to Hong Kong and Shijiazhuang in China, and from Lima to S\u00e3o Paulo in Latin America, people are increasingly suffering in severe toxic smogs \u2013 leaving hospitals and health clinics flooded with people with respiratory and heart problems.   Related: Shock figures to reveal deadly toll of global air pollution    Foul air has blanketed much of urban Asia for many weeks already this winter. In Delhi, where there are nearly nine million vehicles, the high court has compared conditions to \u201cliving in a gas chamber\u201d; Beijing and 10 other Chinese cities have issued red alert warnings; in Tehran, where the chairman of the city council, Mehdi Chamran, says air pollution kills up to 180 people a day, the smog has been so bad that schools have been closed and sports banned. According to the World Health Organisation, the toxic fumes of growing numbers of diesel cars are combining with ammonia emissions from farming, wood and coal fires, tyre burning, open rubbish dumps, and dust from construction sites and brick kilns. The consequence is a global crisis that threatens to overwhelm countries\u2019 economies as people succumb to heart and respiratory diseases, blood vessel conditions, strokes, lung cancers and other long-term illnesses. The toxic haze blanketing cities was observed last week from the international space station. \u201cIt\u2019s bad now, but we just don\u2019t know what will happen in future,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Neira, WHO public health chief. \u201cThis is the first generation in human experience exposed to such high levels of pollution. In the 19th century pollution was bad, but it was concentrated in just a few places. Now there are huge numbers of people living with high levels of pollution. Nearly 70% of people in cities are exposed to pollution above recommended levels.\u201d The problem is most acute in Asia, but many industrialised countries have been hit by smog this winter. Milan, Naples, Barcelona and some other cities in Spain declared an emergency and banned traffic for several days over Christmas; Poland\u2019s most popular mountain resort, Zakopane, was choked in fumes; and several London streets breached their annual limits for nitrogen dioxide just days into 2016. According to a recent study in Nature, led by Johannes Lelieveld, director of the Max Planck Institute for chemistry in Germany, more people now die from air pollution than malaria and HIV combined. They include 1.4 million people a year in China and 650,000 in India. This compares with about 180,000 a year in Europe. New WHO figures on 2,000 cities, to be released next month, will show pollution worsening in many countries. At the last count in 2014, 15 out of the 20 most polluted places were in India and China. The others were in Pakistan, Iran and Bangladesh. Of the worst 100, nearly 70 were in Asia and only a handful in Europe or the US. But the WHO figures include only those cities that measure air pollution, and many of the worst offenders do not. \u201cAs the world urbanises, the pollution grows,\u201d says Frank Kelly, director of environmental health research at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWe suspect that many African cities have terrible pollution problems, but there is very little data. We know that places like Tehran are very polluted. In Europe the pollution is relatively clear in places like Germany, France and Britain, except for the diesel, but in eastern Europe, where they still have old industries, it is still very bad.\u201d After years of being discounted as an unavoidable cost of economic progress, air pollution is rising up the political and economic agendas, as developing countries grasp that the crisis threatens to cripple their economies and lead to simmering dissent.   Most air polluted cities graph   According to a recent WHO study, the cost of disease and the premature deaths caused in Europe every year by air pollution was more than $1.6trillion in 2010, nearly 10% of the gross domestic product of the EU in 2013. The UK was estimated to have suffered $83bn (\u00a354bn) in costs associated with air pollution. Elsewhere in Europe, the figures were Germany $145bn, and France $53bn. The highest was in Bulgaria, which spent an estimated 29.5% of its GDP on the costs of air pollution fatalities. More than 90% of citizens in the European region are exposed to annual levels of outdoor fine particulate matter above WHO\u2019s air quality guidelines. This accounted for 482,000 premature deaths in 2012, from heart and respiratory diseases, blood vessel conditions and strokes, and lung cancer. As concern over pollution grows, cities have begun to take action. On Friday, Delhi ended a two-week trial that took a third of the city\u2019s three million private cars off the road by alternating entry to an odd and even number plates scheme and a ban on large diesel SUVs. City authorities said the trial resulted in a 50% drop in air pollution \u201cprimarily caused by vehicular traffic\u201d, but this is disputed. China has recognised the problem and copied western countries by moving power stations out of cities. This, along with years of heavy investment in renewable energy and increased fines for polluting industries, has improved air quality in some areas. However, away from big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai pollution is still bad. \u201cIt was inevitable in places like London in the 19th century, when health was not considered so important,\u201d says Neira. \u201cBut today it is irresponsible to allow it, and the argument of economic development is not valid. We need to develop a different culture in our cities. We need much better public policies. \u201cIt needs social pressure and more awareness. There is no going back. People will not accept pollution. But not cities are aware how serious it is.\u201d If emissions continue to rise at current rates, the number of smog-induced deaths could double to more than six million a year by 2050, says Lelieveld. \u201cIt is a grim scenario, but I doubt people will accept a doubling of pollution. It is a warning. Pollution is still getting worse, but the awareness is changing and there is a willingness to deal with the problem.\u201d Global picture  BEIJING The Chinese capital has long suffered from serious air pollution from coal burning and industry, but embarrassment at the Olympic Games, the closure of many factories and the removal of power plants from the centre have drastically cut pollution levels. There is a new willingness to deal with it, but pollution remains a big public health threat and Beijing was one of 10 Chinese cities that declared an emergency red alert last month. KABUL The fast-growing Afghan capital city is one of the unhealthiest in the world, surrounded by hills that trap pollution for days on end and full of cars and buses burning low-quality fuel and millions of houses being warmed with wood and paraffin. According to doctors in the main hospital, air pollution is now the greatest cause of death, killing more than 3,000 people a year \u2013 more than from war, terrorism, road accidents or HIV and Aids. Air pollution is also bad in other Afghan cities such as Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Mazar.     Smog in Tehran. Photograph: Ahmad Halabisaz/Corbis    TEHRAN Iranian cities are among the most polluted. Last month the air in Tehran was so bad the city shut all schools, put emergency services on full alert and advised people with cardiac and respiratory problems, as well as pregnant women, to remain indoors. Some of the pollution in the city of five million cars has been blamed on sanctions on imports of refined petrol. This, it is said, has led to the use of low-quality alternatives. DHAKA Bangladeshi cities such as Dhaka, Narayanganj and Gazipur are some of the most polluted and fastest growing in the world. Brick kilns, tyre burning, old cars and heavy traffic combine to make them dangerous to live in. \u201cWhat good is a growth rate of 6% if the air is unbreathable and puts people at high risks of respiratory diseases and other health problems?\u201d a recent editorial in the New Age newspaper asked. LAGOS Air pollution in the fast-growing Nigerian city, the largest in Africa, is reaching dangerous levels. But, as in many cities on the continent, there\u2019s little monitoring of pollution and no accurate information on fuel consumption. Pollution is likely to be as bad as the worst of Indian and Chinese cities. BAKERSFIELD Los Angeles used to be notorious for its smogs but cleaner cars and better regulation has improved air quality. Some of the worst air in the US is now found in nearby Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley, a farming area surrounded by mountains that trap pollution from traffic and agricultural emissions. Warm weather often leads to dangerous photo-chemical smogs.     People breathe fresh air from a giant air purifier in Lima. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters/Corbis    LIMA Peru\u2019s capital has the worst pollution in Latin America, according to a 2014 study by the World Health Organisation. Poor fuel, old buses and cars and the city\u2019s geography between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, all make the air foul at times. Nearly 80% of the estimated 5,000 deaths a year from pollution may be caused by the city\u2019s fleet of old minivans and buses. The many poor areas are the most polluted and are often sited close to open waste dumps and other sources of pollution. CAIRO Air quality in the Egyptian capital city of more than seven million people is often 100 times above World Health Organisation safe limits. The toxic fumes of a million mostly old cars mixes with smoke from farmers burning rice straw, industrial pollutants and desert and construction work dust. Heart disease, stroke and respiratory infections are now among the top four causes of premature death in the capital. In August of last year, the Egyptian environment ministry declared a state of emergency to deal with a thick layer of pollution that hung over the city for days. DELHI With 9 million vehicles and 25 million people, Delhi is possibly the most polluted mega-city in the world, often covered in a foul-smelling toxic haze. The pollution was so bad last month that the city authorities imposed an on- and off-traffic system to try to reduce the number of cars of the choked roads. It also banned large diesel SUVs for two weeks but the full effects have not been analysed. LONDON Once known for its smogs because of massive coal burning, it is now plagued with noxious NO2 gas from hundreds of thousands of diesel engines and the particulates emitted by taxis, central heating systems and construction sites. The government does not expect the city to meet legal pollution levels until 2025. Last week London breached its own legal limit on air pollution for the whole of 2016 in just over seven days.

He might kick me for saying this, but he wasn\u2019t the best player in the world yet he worked like a dog on the things he was better at than others and became the best footballer he could be. As a child, success to me revolved around the idea of being a successful footballer. I wasn\u2019t academic but always wanted to do something active or creative, something other than sitting behind a desk. I was a bit of a fantasist. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know where I was heading, but everything I did want to do, I wanted to be the very best at. When I was four, my parents had split and Mum said we were going on a little holiday to Skegness, but she never took us back to Worksop. She and the man who became my stepfather were strict, but they instilled in me that you only get out of life what you put into it, and if you do put your all in, you will succeed. From the age of 11 to 14, I did a summer job as a donkey boy on the beach. I\u2019d get up at 5.30am to cycle to the outskirts to groom, water, feed and saddle the donkeys. When I was 15, my mum encouraged me to help in the B&amp;B she ran \u2013 stocking the bar, preparing starters, emptying bins, everything. I\u2019d save up any money I made and buy a quality pair of trainers. When you\u2019re exposed young to some graft, it teaches you the virtues of work, an appreciation of money and an understanding of the mechanics of life. Around the time I was doing my GCSEs, I was being bullied and I turned inwards. Fishing had always been a big joy, so rather than go to school I\u2019d sneak off to Boston to go fishing. My parents went ballistic when they found out, but it\u2019d given me time to be alone and daydream, and thankfully I discovered the idea of being a chef. I\u2019ve always found daydreaming useful; nowadays I carry a Moleskine book to jot down ideas. A lot of people are too scared to follow dreams, therefore they don\u2019t achieve. What I mean is, if you do have big dreams, don\u2019t be afraid to chase them. At the same time, don\u2019t over-think things. Nowadays, I deal with restaurants and projects around the globe on a day-to-day basis and that has to be handled naturally, taking each new challenge as it comes along and making sure everything\u2019s done to the best of my and everyone\u2019s ability.     Jason Athertonin Hong Kong in 2013. Photograph: Richard Saker for Observer Food Monthly    At 16 I\u2019d worked briefly at the County Hotel in Skegness, making mediocre trout with almonds and tomato soups. But you need inspiration and mine came from a book I bought for \u00a312.95 from WH Smith in Skegness \u2013 Dining In France by Christian Millau. I thought, \u201cWow. As long as I\u2019m going to cook food, this is the sort I want to cook.\u201d And when you\u2019ve decided to do something for the rest of your life, you\u2019ve got to get your bum in motion and move to the best place to make a success of learning your craft. When I was 17, that clearly was London. If you send applications to lots of top chefs and get a day trial with one of them, you put your soul into getting the job. For me, that was a commis position at Boyd Gilmour\u2019s Covent Garden restaurant. My sister said, \u201cJason, if you leave without telling Mum, she\u2019ll go crazy\u201d, and I said, \u201cYes, she\u2019ll insist I stay in Skeggy, do college and wait until I\u2019m 20.\u201d So I just packed my bags and left. And thank goodness. (My parents still can\u2019t believe it when I mention that I\u2019m cooking that evening at 10 Downing Street or I\u2019m at a Lakers game with Benedict Cumberbatch). You have to overcome the terror of moving to a city, but I lived in a decent youth hostel, remained determined and got stuck in. It\u2019s a matter of impressing the chef-owner that you could be one of the special chefs who he can be confident will make his kitchen great. I think it\u2019s important for success that, after years of being a sous chef, I started learning about kitchen management and rotas and so on at [Oliver Peyton\u2019s] Coast, which had 150 diners for lunch, 350 for dinner. By comparison, you don\u2019t learn so much at Michelin-star restaurants, where everyone just turns up for work and does their own job. But going to Manchester to run Mash &amp; Air [again for Peyton] came too quickly after that. I was 26 and rented my first posh apartment there off Alex Ferguson\u2019s son. I suppose that\u2019s what\u2019s considered success and cool, after years of sharing little flats with five other chefs. But I was no way ready for the responsibility, with 55 chefs under me. Manchester in the 90s was a pretty brutal place, and staff would get wasted and not turn up for work. I was snowed under and it nearly broke my career. So sometimes you have to step back and admit you weren\u2019t ready. I literally dropped everything, including my girlfriend, and went off to Spain to do an internship as a chef de partie, working for free under the great Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. It felt wonderful to go in every day and open scallops, prep asparagus and wash spinach properly. And then in the afternoon \u2013 rather than going through orders and attending meetings about hygiene \u2013 sit with my feet in the sea, daydreaming for two hours. It was like therapy.   Related: The kitchen apprentices: have knives, will travel    You want things perfect all the time as a young chef \u2013 especially when you\u2019re single-minded and starting to push yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s very easy to lose your temper and scream and bully, and very hard to be pragmatic and say, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it right tomorrow by doing this and this instead.\u201d You have to learn to behave maturely; you can\u2019t just wake up one day a better person. It\u2019s piece by piece. So, better today than yesterday \u2013 that\u2019s my mantra. When Gordon Ramsay asked me to go to Dubai in 2000 to executive chef at Verre, I was single and thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst case scenario? No one\u2019s going to die.\u201d Four years later, I came back and opened Maze and was credited with turning it into the biggest money-spinner in Gordon\u2019s empire, but there were assorted factors in its success. Every so often you hit on a concept that fits the time \u2013 this was the mid-noughties \u2013 and there was a boom going on, there was Gordon\u2019s name, backing power and restaurateuring skills to start a restaurant of magnitude, plus my cooking skills. And we achieved something quite unusual \u2013 haute cuisine stepped up and operated like an incredible machine. You couldn\u2019t get a table for months; people were willing to pay anything to get in. It\u2019s important what Gordon told me, late in 2005: \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Of course you want to be successful, we all do, but with everything you do, make sure you do it correctly.\u201d And he was so right. Once, I thought I was impressing him by saying, \u201cI\u2019ve not had a day off in four months\u201d, and he replied, \u201cThen you\u2019re stupid. You should be putting pressure on your sous chef. A kitchen should run just as well without you as with, Jason. I\u2019ll look at you as a success when you haven\u2019t got more bags under your eyes than I count at Heathrow.\u201d Since I left Ramsay Holdings and started Jason Atherton Ltd in 2010, I have combined my dreams with opportunities as they\u2019ve come along, and the company currently has investments in 14 restaurants worldwide. I spend up to 40% of my time travelling around them, but of course it\u2019s impossible, believe me, to run 14 restaurants day in, day out. You have to have strategic partners, really good restaurateurs doing that on the ground, with the chef de cuisines receiving a percentage so they drive up the covers, touch tables, work with the managers and report to me. It\u2019s very important that never at any point have I said, or implied by putting my name in the restaurant name, that I\u2019d be cooking in them, except at Pollen Street Social. That is the only restaurant where I\u2019m chef de cuisine. Yet every day I communicate with all the restaurants. Skype, text, phone calls, emails, you name it, plus weekly conference calls. Of course, every complaint received from a customer anywhere \u2013 about food quality, service or anything \u2013 is forwarded to and dealt with by me and my wife. The reason we handle those is that we have more of an emotional attachment and can use complaints to over-view failure and correct for success. I might spend four days in each city when travelling. Say, four in Hong Kong, four in Shanghai, four in Dubai, then home. At times it\u2019s pretty tough on the body, but I watch what I eat and go to the gym pretty much every weekday, then try to enjoy myself more during weekends, and it seems to work, you know. Functioning globally becomes natural, whether you\u2019re travelling or at home. Time zones become nothing more than just a number on a clock \u2013 you deal with situations as you or they wake up in different zones. There\u2019s always a possibility of something going on at any moment \u2013 there\u2019s no time within each 24 hours when nothing might happen.   Related: Jason Atherton: a 21st-century cook's tour of the east    It sounds odd to say, with some of the restaurants still having massive debt, but I don\u2019t feel under financial pressure. When I only had one, I felt under immense financial pressure, but now we\u2019ve got 14 \u2013 and there\u2019s another six opening over the next four years \u2013 I don\u2019t feel it. It\u2019s bizarre but true. Probably my biggest failure in life is that I wasn\u2019t as good a husband to my wife as I could have been in our first six years of marriage, as everything was about me. We were living separate lives and I regret that greatly, but I set about rectifying it by involving her much more, because I\u2019m a big believer in marriage, keeping family together and being a team. That\u2019s success. People always say, \u201cYou must be so tired, Jason.\u201d But it depends on which day you catch me. Some days I\u2019m more tired than others, but I definitely live in a constant state of varying tiredness and have been since I was 16. But it\u2019s not my thing to drown in alcohol. Yesterday, after we\u2019d been super-busy at Pollen Street Social, I went home, had a cup of tea and a chat with my wife and then we started to watch the film Kajaki: The True Story, and I nodded off to that, no problem. I feel really privileged and honoured to have a job I love, a family supporting and enriching my life, that customers are eating our food and appreciating it and coming back for more, and that I have a great team who have the same ethos as me. So that\u2019s as good a work/life balance as I can think of. Once I\u2019m 58, I\u2019ll stop working nights and my kids will be in their early 20s. I won\u2019t be able to go to clubs with them but at least there\u2019ll be time for family dinners. It\u2019s intriguing how people perceive my success. An old chef friend I bumped into a while ago said, \u201cOh everyone\u2019s so proud of your success\u201d, then added, \u201cI heard you\u2019ve just bought a massive house in Mayfair.\u201d Yet I still live in the same house in Balham as when I started the company. And drive the same car, too. But good clothes, I\u2019m happy to spend more on those, because back in the day my nickname was Mr Country Casual.", "tags": ["Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Careers"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-17T08:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/17/david-bowie-as-seen-by-deborah-harry-chris-kate-bush-stein-carlos-alomar-julien-temple-edwyn-collins", "sentences": ["Like the mirrored gallery of personas at the end of The Lady from Shanghai, he appeared capable of being anything he wanted to become and he challenged you to think about yourself in the same way."], "title": "David Bowie, as remembered by\u2026", "article": "Deborah Harry and Chris Stein: \u2018He showed up at our house one night with Mick Jagger \u2013 that was pretty great\u2019 The Blondie stars remember supporting Bowie in 1977 Chris Stein: The first time we met Bowie was when we supported him and Iggy Pop [for The Idiot tour in 1977]. We were in awe of him and Iggy right from the get-go. He was always very charming and gentlemanly, but also wary and kind of catty at the same time. I remember we talked about the new wave, and about [Television frontman] Tom Verlaine\u2019s hairdo a lot. He was a little sarcastic and derisive of it, but at the same time I thought he was also kind of jealous of the attention the hairdo was getting. Debbie Harry: Yes, he had a good sense of humour. It felt casual. It wasn\u2019t like we were trying to be intense or correct about things, we were just hanging out. What was really impressive to me about David was that he had such a terrific sense of being an entertainer and also about the music business. He was a very shrewd, very sharp guy. That was consistent throughout his career: he had the ability to sell this oddity that he was, and make it clear to people who would normally be completely resistant to what he was doing. He reached millions and millions of people. Touring with him took us from being a very New York-based cult band into being possibly a real international music source.     Debbie Harry with David Bowie, photogrpahed backstage during 1977\u2019s The Idiot tour by Chris Stein of Blondie. Photograph: from the book Chris Stein / Negative published by Rizzoli    CS: And he did the same thing for Iggy, to a certain extent. Iggy still had a kind of cult status; he wasn\u2019t a megastar in the A list, the way Bowie was. But Bowie was very generous: he was just at the back, playing keyboards. He was really concerned with the whole show moving smoothly. The show was so professional and at the same time crazy and exciting \u2013 he managed to put the two things together.    Bowie was like Andy Warhol: when he walked into a party it would be like the pope had arrived  Chris Stein, Blondie     DH: That was when he had the Low album out, which was received poorly. He got some real heavy criticism for that. But there you go. The whole show was wonderful and energetic. It was our first big tour. We\u2019d never played on such a big stage before. He gave me some technical advice about working the different sides and centre, and advice about finding the light. Theatrical stuff. He worked in mime, and he had a real theatrical background. On the stage he was elegant and such a strong presence: he was very graceful and versatile. His versatility was one of his major points: he was truly a renaissance artist and man. CS: After that, we hung out a bunch of times over the years and he was always very gracious. I saw him in the summer of 2013 for the last time. We were talking about Lou Reed and how we were worried about Lou. Bowie was like Andy Warhol: when he walked into a party it would be like the pope had arrived. It was a combination of his notoriety and his persona. He came to our house with Mick Jagger one time and that was fucking awesome. They showed up in the evening: the doorbell rang and it was Bowie and Jagger. I got to smoke a joint with Mick \u2013 that was pretty great. DH: They were curious about our new home, and just wanted to hang out, I guess. So they dropped in, and we actually let them in the house [laughs]. CS: In terms of music, Bowie was definitely a big influence on us, especially in the way he was always reinventing himself and his style. And his eclecticism: never being scared to experiment and go in different directions. I\u2019d seen the Spiders from Mars show at Radio City [in February 1973] before I met [Debbie]. Everybody from downtown was at that. DH: I went to see him during the Ziggy Stardust tour at Carnegie Hall. So we had both been influenced or appreciative [of Bowie] even before we met or started working together. CS: One time, years ago, we performed Heroes with Robert Fripp live. The song is very simple but so imaginative at the same time \u2013 the whole anthemic quality of it. It\u2019s about the glory of being a weirdo. It\u2019s a great sentiment. David Bowie touched everybody, for God\u2019s sakes. It\u2019s crazy. The music and just everything about him has run into so many facets of our society. I think people underestimate the masses. People, especially nowadays, are ready for things that push the envelope a lot more, and Bowie was always pushing it. I mean, in the first images we were seeing of him he was wearing a dress. DH: It always seemed very important to have talked with him and to have met him. One thing that really surprised me about him was he was chameleon-like, which is obvious in the transition of characters he developed over the years, but you\u2019d never notice him if he was out walking in the street. He was very clever, he was very good at that: he walked around the city streets wherever he was and no one ever really recognised him. CS: Musically, I\u2019m amazed at this last bit of stuff, I\u2019m just starting to get into it. It\u2019s interesting that he chose to go in a jazzy direction. He references passing in these videos and music that he\u2019s put out. And I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. I\u2019ve been struggling to try to think of something similar and I really can\u2019t. Maybe Byron, or Yukio Mishima, the Japanese writer, who killed himself very dramatically, but that was more sloppy than this thing that Bowie has done now. It\u2019s just amazing that he pulled this off. DH: It\u2019s like a Romantic poet. The thing that\u2019s really great about this is that \u2013 putting myself in his place, and thinking, \u201cwow, what a great idea this is, to hold on to\u201d \u2013 instead of lying around being sick and miserable, he took the energy he had left and was creative, doing this thing that he liked the best. So now I think that that\u2019s the most admirable part of it, although it\u2019s a little hard to take right now. It\u2019s a great tribute to his strength and creativity. He had a totality to his vision, and he carried it through to the end. Kate Bush: \u2018He was wonderfully eccentric \u2013 and he was ours\u2019 The singer-songwriter recalls a musical icon David Bowie had everything. He was intelligent, imaginative, brave, charismatic, cool, sexy and truly inspirational both visually and musically. He created such staggeringly brilliant work, yes, but so much of it and it was so good. There are great people who make great work but who else has left a mark like his? No one like him. I\u2019m struck by how the whole country has been flung into mourning and shock. Shock, because someone who had already transcended into immortality could actually die. He was ours. Wonderfully eccentric in a way that only an Englishman could be. Whatever journey his beautiful soul is now on, I hope he can somehow feel how much we all miss him. Carlos Alomar: \u2018He wanted to be hip so I took him to see some Latin bands\u2019   The guitarist played on many Bowie albums The first time I met him he had finished with the Spiders from Mars. It was the mid-70s and he was recording with Lulu. I was one of the session musicians and when I got to the studio a pasty, 98lb, orange-haired man covered in white pancake makeup came through the door. He was really sweet, dropping all these Americanisms like [adopts British accent]: \u201cHey man\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s really cool\u201d. He wanted to be hip so I took him to see some Latin bands and then to the Apollo theatre to see Richard Pryor. Can you imagine what it was like backstage after the show? Pryor was like \u201cWho\u2019s this white guy?\u201d          Watch: David Bowie\u2019s Young Americans.    David wanted me to work with him. He asked me to play on Diamond Dogs and tour with him and I couldn\u2019t do either. Finally he asked me to do an album with the theme of \u201cthe sound of Philadelphia\u201d and I agreed. I brought this troupe of amazing musicians to the Young Americans (1975) album sessions, like my wife, Robin Clark, my best friend, Luther Vandross, and the bass player Emir Kassan. It took three weeks to record the album. He\u2019d never done that before, his albums with the Spiders took three to four months to make. It was in the cocaine days and he needed to stay up because the recording would happen all through to night. We worked 20- to 24-hour days on that album. They would wake me up to do a guitar track at three in the morning and Luther Vandross at 4am to lay down a backing vocal.    David was like a comet, blazing brightly\u2026 that comet travelled too fast for us to see it and take it all in at once  Carlos Alomar     My favourite memory of working with him was when Tina Turner came in to record Tonight (1984) with us. I\u2019d never seen him so nervous, not in front of record companies, not in front of managers or anybody. But, man, he was like a little school kid trying to make sure everything was just right. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out for dinner and you\u2019ve got to come!\u2019 I said, \u201cShe\u2019s Tina Turner, she\u2019s not going to bite you! Get some man balls.\u201d He was so nervous. In the end, it was a wonderful meeting. We found out that she\u2019s a Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist. David was a Buddhist and I\u2019m a Buddhist, so we ended up speaking about our life philosophies. The conversation was fuelled by drink, so it went from heaven to hell pretty fast [laughs]. The last time I saw him was at Tony Visconti\u2019s birthday party. We were having a great time but he looked a little bit frail. I just figured, we\u2019re all getting older. There was no indication that anything else was going on. But the master had planned it a certain way: he had his birthday which we celebrated like crazy, then he released Blackstar and then, oh by the way, he died. The sequence of events doesn\u2019t give you enough time to process them because your brain is trying to decipher the message that\u2019s in that great record. David was like a comet, blazing brightly into the sky. That comet travelled too fast for us to see it and take it all in at once. Gail Ann Dorsey: \u2018I thought his call was one of my mates playing a practical joke\u2019   Played bass in Bowie\u2019s band 1995-2016 In my case, it was not a matter of being \u201cintroduced\u201d to David Bowie, but somehow, by the fickle and unfathomable laws of the universe, I happen to be one of the extremely fortunate musicians in an endless sea of amazing musicians to be \u201cchosen\u201d by him. It was the spring of 1995 and I was in Bath, writing and recording music for a solo album project with Roland Orzabal of Tears for Fears. A telephone call came completely out of the blue one afternoon. I naturally assumed it was one of my London mates playing a practical joke on me! Ha ha! It took me a minute or two of embarrassing myself to finally realise it was indeed Mr Bowie himself asking if I would be interested in playing bass in a band he was putting together for a tour with Nine Inch Nails that coming fall. Obviously, my answer was not \u201cno\u201d, and so it seems, from where we find ourselves today, the rest was history\u2026          Watch: David Bowie and Gail Ann Dorsey, Under Pressure.    In the 20 years following that life-changing phone call, some of the mystery of how he stumbled upon me became a bit clearer. Bowie was an astute observer. He was a man who was constantly seeking the new, the now, and had a voracious appetite for devouring the sweet seeds of the future. As a human being as well as an artist, he was able to see the potential for creative expression in virtually everything and everyone around him; perhaps the God-given aptitude that set him apart from the rest. Through his work, it feels like he knows us, even better than we know ourselves. That certainly proved to be true in my case. To watch David work, to be witness to his brilliant and nimble mind, and to be a member of his extraordinary team for the realisation of his unparalleled artistic visions is just as educational and exhilarating as one would imagine. [Working with] an artist of his calibre and stature could have been a disappointing, nightmarish charade of ego and hierarchy, but there was always an atmosphere of professionalism, respect, endless humour, and love\u2026 While no one can claim to be \u201cperfect\u201d as a human being, as an artist, he was. Sadie Coles: \u2018He invited us all to see him play in Hanover Street one night\u2019  Gallerist whose first space features on a Bowie album cover       The first address of Sadie Coles HQ was 35 Heddon Street, London. I think Sarah Lucas pointed out it was the site of the cover of Ziggy Stardust and that seemed to us to bode well for our new venture, particularly as Bowie then turned up unannounced at our Sarah Lucas show, The Law (1997). He called the [Heddon Street] gallery and chatted to director Pauline Daly, inviting us all \u2013 Sarah and a host of YBAs to see him play in Hanover Street one night. He was an inspirational example of how an artist can choose to protect themselves, and their work, from the polluting noise of the unnecessary. When we were seeking permission for music rights for a documentary on Sarah Lucas it was a revelation to realise how super-minimal David Bowie\u2019s management was. Meaning his extraordinary output was truly pure, truly his vision and not filtered through a host of PR agencies, managers and business people: an artist living the life he wanted to live, on his terms, making the work he wanted to make. That can teach us something. His was an elegant life, work and exit. Edwyn Collins: \u2018He was never aloof. He was easy to fall in love with\u2019  The Scottish singer-songwriter first fell for Bowie as a teenager We were so lucky, to be adolescent when Bowie burst on to the scene. We got him in real time, when we were forming, and the yearning for each new record from him was so thrilling. Then it arrived \u2013 who got it first? Who could afford it, had saved up? Congregating in bedrooms, devouring it, no talking. A side, B side, flip it over, needle to the start, again and again. Our Bowie rituals. For quite a long time, in Dundee and then Glasgow, most of my waking hours were spent thinking about Bowie. I know David made himself seem alien and strange, but he was never aloof. He was easy to fall in love with. He was warm, you could walk around with him in your head all day and it comforted you. I read he was asked about teenyboppers liking him and he said something like his mind was at its best when he was 14. I don\u2019t know if mine was, but when I started writing songs, it was Bowie lyrics that made me think I had to improve my early dismal efforts. At the fag-end of the Orange Juice days, a good memory \u2013 on stage at Crystal Palace Bowl, at a GLC-funded all-dayer. I sang Memory of a Free Festival. Kind of taking the piss, but the truth is, I didn\u2019t have to learn the words. I knew them then and still do now, even though I\u2019ve forgotten the words to many of my own songs. In return for all he\u2019s given me I wished him a long and happy old age with his family. I\u2019m very sad he didn\u2019t get it. Other people had other idols. I repeat, we were the lucky ones. We had Bowie. Julien Temple: \u2018He talked often about his need to engineer an elegant exit\u2019  Film-maker, directed Bowie in Absolute Beginners (1986) I first saw Bowie at Glastonbury in 1971 as a golden midsummer dawn broke over the do-it-yourself version of the Pyramid stage. His voice and acoustic guitar were complemented by what seemed like a celestial dawn chorus of birds and I thought he must be singing to us from another dimension. That may have had something to do with chemicals in the air at the time but, extraordinarily, I\u2019ve experienced exactly that same extra-dimensional feeling of spectral, spellbound awe when listening to him (stone cold, Spotified sober this time round) singing Lazarus from beyond the grave. It\u2019s proved more difficult than any of us could have imagined to process our collective sense of loss but surely if any death can be seen to be something positive it has to be David\u2019s. In transforming his own death into a provocative and mysterious work of art, he has left behind a haunting and disorienting final masterpiece that ensures he will remain in communication with each one of us as though he were still alive.     Bowie in Absolute Beginners (1986). Photograph: Alamy    When I knew him well in the 1980s \u2013 we worked together on Absolute Beginners among other projects \u2013 David talked often about his compelling need to engineer an elegant exit mechanism from the circus of pop stardom and fame. A Houdini-like disappearing act. A velvet parachute floating down and away from the public eye. He was obsessive about it even then and it is beyond extraordinary that he has now managed to pull it off with such breathtaking ingenuity and precision. A Garboesque process that began with him invisibly evading the rabid buzz-hounds of the Twittersphere has ended with what seems like a magnesium flash, a sudden trick of the light and a triumphant vanishing act.    He was very aware of this strange tension between the weird and the normal within himself  Julien Temple     As he confides to us in Blackstar, he was operating way beyond the confines of a pop stardom which for him was always only the means to a bigger end. We should remember Bowie as a great human emancipator on the Bol\u00edvar or Mandela scale. An emotional liberator of people. He was the patron saint of the outsider, the uninvited and the misfit. All those lonely teenagers in each generation, unsure of who, or what they could possibly be \u2013 or become. In other words all of us. Like the mirrored gallery of personas at the end of The Lady from Shanghai, he appeared capable of being anything he wanted to become and he challenged you to think about yourself in the same way. When I met him I was expecting the Man Who Fell to Earth but what I got instead was more like the insecure guy next door. Initially shocked by that, I soon realised he was very aware of this strange tension between the weird and the normal within himself. He knew it was refracted somehow through his brother [Bowie\u2019s half-brother, Terry Burns, who suffered with schizophrenia and killed himself in 1985] and recognised it as the wellspring of his creativity. The Blue Jean film [Jazzin\u2019 for Blue Jean, a 21-minute short film released in 1984] we made together was based upon it. His ordinariness was the secret behind the uniquely intimate relationship that exists between him and his audience and explains his ability to reach people on such a universal scale. To touch them, teach them, like his brother taught him, and turn them on to the stranger aspects of themselves. To watch him transition from normality into something completely incandescent as he stepped on stage was something miraculous to behold. He contained within him a kind of Blakean star power that he seemed to be able to summon up and unleash at will. We should be profoundly grateful that someone standing on the edge of nothingness could send out and bounce back thoughts and feelings from beyond the limits of mortality to confound and catalyse us all over again. As he first did a lifetime ago when he beamed down that band from Mars\u2026 It\u2019s hard to think of him as history, because he was always the future. Robert Fox: \u2018He looked exhausted but made not one complaint\u2019     Bowie in the Lazarus video, filmed when he was very ill.     Theatre producer who worked with Bowie on his stage musical Lazarus  I met David Bowie over 40 years ago. I can\u2019t remember the exact date. It was at a small party thrown by mutual friends in a flat off London\u2019s Fulham Road. Somehow I found myself talking to him about Bryan Ferry \u2013 he was joking that I should be his manager for some long forgotten reason. Over the ensuing years we saw one another infrequently, but it was really after he moved to New York that we spent more time together when I was there producing various plays. He would come to see the shows and loved to talk about all aspects of the theatre. On 20 October 2015, the first day of rehearsals for the musical Lazarus, just after the cast had gathered together, I got a call from Coco Schwab, David\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, asking me to go to a studio on Ingraham Street in Brooklyn. I knew that I would see David there, but I didn\u2019t know anything else. When I arrived I was taken by Coco through the studio that was being set up for a film shoot, into a dressing room at the back of the building to find David sitting quietly, dressed in what looked like Victorian pyjamas, having hair and makeup done. He was cheerful and talkative, explaining the physical set up for the shoot and his character for the video of his new song Lazarus, the title song of our musical. I was surprised that he wanted to undertake such an arduous task, knowing as I did that he was very unwell. I knew this not because I was part of some elite inner sanctum, but because he had to tell a small group of people working on Lazarus, so that we could understand why he might be unavailable for certain periods of time. He was soon called on to the set and I went and sat with the director of the shoot, Johan Renck. David climbed into a bed that was hung vertically to give the impression that he was defying gravity which allowed him to lift off a \u201cflat\u201d bed. He also had by now had his head wrapped in bandages with button eyes preventing him from seeing anything. I had got off a plane only the night before after a 21-hour flight and was beginning to think that I was tripping as Johan Renck and his lighting cameraman jabbered away in Swedish, discussing the complexity of the shot. Then \u201caction\u201d \u2013 the first take \u2013 and then a second and so on up to 10. The camera was on the end of a crane, which was attached to a track, being operated to move by remote control and being required to end on a close-up circling David\u2019s bandaged head. By take 10, I was wondering how in the name of God David could tolerate this seeming torture, but he did so with jokes and good manners, until he quietly said that he needed a bit of a break while they all prepared for the next set-up. And so he went back to his dressing room and I followed shortly thereafter. He looked exhausted but made not one complaint. He asked for a salad and said he\u2019d go and sit quietly on his own. I left to go back to Manhattan, realising yet again that nothing was going to stop David from finishing all the work he had undertaken. This involved spending the rest of that day completing the shoot. It also meant, in the weeks that followed, attending rehearsals, band calls and run-throughs of Lazarus and appearing on opening night, 7 December, to lend his support and encouragement to everyone involved. I have been fortunate to have worked with a number of huge creative talents, and David was as great as, if not greater than, any of them. He had one quality that was unique in my experience \u2013 he had his ego completely in check. Not for one second did he behave with anything other than impeccable manners, humour and grace and a desire to collaborate on an entirely even playing field. He had nothing but support and encouragement for his colleagues and his highly tuned and immensely well disciplined brain inspired others to try to achieve their best. The extraordinary outpouring of love and sadness over these past few days is, of course, to do with him being a great artist, but it is also as much to do with him having been a great man. Nicola Tyson: \u2018You felt in safe hands with him. He made it OK, made you want to make art\u2019   Painter who was a regular at the influential Bowie Nights at Billy\u2019s, Soho, in the 1970s  It would be easy to start this by saying: \u201cFor my generation, Bowie was a defining influence\u201d, but his influence didn\u2019t stop \u2013 or even begin \u2013 with my generation. Bowie\u2019s influence spanned the last 50 years, in which he consistently surprised and inspired us anew, with different and unpredictable creative co-ordinates.    Related: 'The birth of the London club scene': Bowie Nights at Billy's Club \u2013 in pictures    The very early punk scene of \u201976-\u201977 had a dark Roxy Music/Bowie/Warholian glamour component. It wasn\u2019t yet purely about moronic ugliness, uniformity and gobbing. After hours \u2013 once the gigs were over and the pubs had shut \u2013 the then small London punk scene took safe haven in the handful of West End gay clubs, where anything went already and creative outsiders were welcomed. When punk went mainstream in \u201978 and the underground thrill was gone, inevitably it was from within that milieu and in those venues that the next scene would develop. Inevitably, too, Bowie \u2013 pop cultural magician, androgyne, fount of subversive creativity, master of flamboyance and understatement \u2013 would be its muse. In 1978, I was 18, still a teenager like most of the Bowie Nights\u2019 crowd. We hadn\u2019t wanted punk to end \u2013 it had only just got started, most of us having only found our way to it in early \u201977. So to fill the void we needed to invent a new scene and Bowie Nights was a start. It meant self-expression, self-invention, pushing on out beyond your comfort zone and, most importantly, beyond that of everyone else. It\u2019s shocking to think he\u2019s no longer there. You always felt in safe hands with him \u2013 he\u2019d make it all OK, make it into art, make you want to make art. It feels like another anchor with the past has been pulled up and we\u2019ll have to drift on into the future now without his singular, sophisticated guidance.

The RRR is currently zero. \u201cGrowth keeps slowing ... Lower commodity prices, including oil, partly reflect weakening demand itself. In addition, the downturn in mining [investment] and the declining income of commodity producers is weighing on exports from Asia,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, Hong Kong.

The more widely traded London benchmark Brent crude, which dipped below $28 briefly on Monday, lost 24c to $28.52 a barrel.

Stocks in Australia closed down 1.3% with the Asia-focused bank, ANZ, down 4.5% and the country\u2019s huge resources and energy sectors also being punished. In South Korea, the Kospi index was off 2.34%.

The index has lost more than one-third of its value since April 2015.  The China government-backed China Securities Journal reported that Beijing had the policy space for further easing to support the economy, including raising deficit spending to around 3% of annual economic output.  China\u2019s central bank revealed late on Tuesday that it would inject more than 600bn yuan ($91.22bn) into the banking system to help ease a liquidity squeeze expected before the long new year celebrations.  However, such a move was usual before the holidays and stopped well short of an actual cut in bank reserve ratios.

The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.17%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose a single point and the Nasdaq eased 0.26%.

The Portuguese is currently on holiday in Shanghai so the rest of us can enjoy a well-earned and long overdue break. As far as their playing personnel is concerned, Manchester United are keeping tabs on Romelu Lukaku, but will have to stump up \u00a365m to convince Everton to let the Belgian striker leave Goodison Park. Still just 22, apparently baggage-free and having been successful at every club he\u2019s played for (apart from the one that actually brought him to the Premier League only to decide they didn\u2019t fancy him), the industrious Belgian striker looks a steal for that amount, considering the kind of silly money being hosed around football circles these days.

Manchester City have joined the long and predictable list of English suitors who are whispering sweet nothings in the ear of Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Wiliams. A native of the Spanish port town in which he plays his football, the 21-year-old is a graduate of the club\u2019s Lezama academy and can play anywhere across the front three.

Should they wish to bring Wiliams to the Etihad, Manchester City will have to fend off interest from Real Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal, among others. Following last season\u2019s Championship heroics, Odion Ighalo has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water. Quite how the Watford striker would take to Stamford Bridge is another matter, but Chelsea are determined to find out and will jettison Radamal Falcao and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my if they land their target.

Broadly speaking, it\u2019s a stock market in which the price of equities falls over a sustained period, creating a background of negative sentiment. With investors anticipating further losses they sell stocks, which makes the market fall further. Some people use a more specific definition, which is when the market falls 20% below its peak over the course of at least two months. The most recent example came between October 2007 and March 2009, when many stock markets ended up mired in bear territory amid the global financial crisis. Which markets are in bear territory? The FTSE 100 dipped into a bear market on Wednesday afternoon. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index peaked at 7103 in April last year and has been falling ever since. At about 3.30pm it moved below 5,682, making it teatime for the bears. The FTSE isn\u2019t be alone.

What about a bull market? It might be a while before we see one of these, but essentially bulls are the opposite of bears in that they take a \u201cbullish\u201d, or optimistic, view of the market.

Your pension is in trouble (again) The more than 5 million workers who every month pay into a stock market-based pension from their salary are worst hit. At retirement, they simply get back what they have paid in plus any investment returns. The FTSE 100 index has slumped by a fifth since hitting an all-time high of 7122 on 27 April 2015, which means pension pots have shrivelled.       The only good news is that your pension is unlikely to be 100% invested in the FTSE 100. A typical workplace pension fund spreads investments across a range of assets, such as bonds and property, and they have not all fared as badly as stocks.  For example, the mainstream shares-based fund run by Legal &amp; General for lots of employers has seen losses of around 12%-13% since April. But pension investors will also have some of their money in the bond portfolio, where losses are just 1%-2%, while the cash element will have gone up, albeit only slightly. This means that overall, workers will have lost around 7%-8% of their pension pot since April \u2013 bad news, but not as catastrophic as the headlines suggest.  The millions of workers still in final-salary pension schemes, mostly in the public sector, are not affected as they have guarantees based on their salary levels. But if the stock market remains weak, many of these promises become tougher to finance. Your Isas are down dramatically Some of the funds popular with small investors are down heavily. M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a36bn Global Dividend fund has lost 20% since April, the worst performer among the 25 biggest funds in the country, according to figures from Trustnet.com. Vanguard\u2019s \u00a34bn UK all share index fund, which simply tracks the stock market, is down more than 15%, while Halifax\u2019s \u00a35bn UK Growth fund is down 14.5%.  But some of the star fund managers have performed relatively well during the crisis. Neil Woodford\u2019s \u00a38bn Equity Income fund has lost just 2.9%, while the stand-out performer is Terry Smith\u2019s \u00a34.5bn Fundsmith Equity fund. It has delivered a profit of 2% since April despite markets falling virtually everywhere.  If you hold individual shares, you\u2019ve been hammered  The London stock market has been hit particularly hard because it is home to the world\u2019s biggest mining groups. Anglo American, which just five years ago was the 15th biggest constituent of the FTSE 100 with a value of \u00a331.5bn, has been worst hit. Its shares have collapsed from a peak of \u00a334.21 in 2011 to just \u00a32.24, with its Brazilian iron ore and Australian coal mines suffering as demand from China has dropped. So if you held \u00a31,000-worth of Anglo American shares five years ago they are worth just \u00a365 today.      The bear market will hit pensions and shares, though the price of flights may come down. Photograph: Tom Mason/Rex Shutterstock    Share in other metals and minerals companies in the FTSE 100 have also tumbled: Glencore has collapsed from \u00a35.24 to just 75p, while BHP Billiton is down from \u00a326.10 to \u00a36.08. The falling price of crude has also rocked the oil majors, with Shell down from \u00a321 to \u00a313.50 over the past year.  However, not every FTSE 100 stock is down. Share prices in housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratts have continued to increase, while Direct Line, Hargreaves Lansdown and ITV are all ahead.  Interest rates will stay at rock bottom Inflation is just 0.2% in the UK and the eurozone, so the prospects of an interest rate rise are virtually zero this year. The falling Shanghai stock market is also pushing the value of its currency down, making Chinese exports cheaper, and exporting deflation around the world. It\u2019s good news if you have a tracker mortgage as monthly payments are unlikely to rise, but it\u2019s further bad news for savers suffering near-invisible returns on their deposits.  Prices in shops may fall The price of oil is down, as are metal and commodity costs, while Chinese imports are getting cheaper. The ONS said this week that input prices for manufacturers in the UK are 10% less than last year. Even some soft commodities have fallen hard \u2013 the wholesale price of coffee beans is down 25% on the year \u2013 although corn, wheat and sugar prices have been broadly stable.  Holidays will be more expensive \u2013 but flights cheaper     The best place for your money over the past five years has actually been UK smaller companies funds    Over the past two years British holidaymakers have almost never had it so good, with sterling rising sharply, particularly against the euro, meaning cheap holidays in Spain. But in the past month sterling has weakened dramatically against the euro, with the pound now buying just \u20ac1.28 compared with \u20ac1.42 in late 2015. The US will also look expensive for British visitors, with sterling hitting a seven-year low against the dollar this week.  But there could be an airline price war. Aviation fuel is usually the single biggest cost for airlines. It has collapsed in price, but until now that hasn\u2019t fed through to lower fares because airlines were locked into long-term contracts. They are now unwinding, allowing airlines to cut prices (or fatten their profits).       What you can do Most people are fatalistic about their pensions, crossing their fingers and hoping things will improve. Individuals can choose to pay more in, using their company\u2019s \u201cadditional voluntary contributions\u201d. At least the money will be used to buy shares and bonds that are cheaper today than a year ago. But others will argue that is just throwing good money after bad.  Anyone who decided to follow the Guardian\u2019s Keep It in the Ground campaign last year and divested from coal, oil and gas has done particularly well. Stocks such as those of Royal Dutch Shell have been among the worst performers on the stock market, so being out of them will have paid off.  The brave investor may want to buy the thing that has fallen most, in the hope that it will rebound. On that basis, you would want to sell the top-performing fund sector of the past year, European smaller companes, which are up 11%, and buy global emerging markets funds, which are down 18%. But there is no guarantee such a strategy will work; emerging markets funds have been the worst performers in the funds universe over six months, one year, three years and five years. When you were told to put your money into China for long-term growth, it was wrong. The best place for your money over the past five years has actually been UK smaller companies funds.

The world No1 was speaking after easing into the third round of the Australian Open for the 10th year in a row with only minor inconvenience in three sets, 6-1, 6-2, 7-6, against the teenage French qualifier Quentin Halys, and seemed surprised by a barrage of questions about a match that took place nine years ago.   Related: Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova move closer to Australian Open meeting    Santoro, who was 39 in the world at the time and has forged a career as a TV commentator since retiring six years ago, won that match 6-3, 6-2 with Wednesday\u2019s Tuttosport claiming Djokovic \u201cvoluntarily lost\u201d. The late-night exchange between Djokovic and the media was tense, with several embarrassing pauses as he described the allegations as \u201cabsurd\u201d and untrue. Djokovic, who admitted on Monday he had been offered $200,000 in 2006 to throw a match in St Petersburg a month before the Paris Masters and had refused (he did not play in the Russian event in the end), said he had not had his attention drawn to the latest article. When it was explained the story connected the match with \u201cchanging odds that have been discussed here in the previous couple of days,\u201d he said: \u201cMy response is that there\u2019s always going to be, especially these days when there is a lot of speculations, this is now the main story in tennis, in sports world, there\u2019s going to be a lot of allegations, so \u2026 \u201cI have nothing more to say. I said everything I needed to say two days ago. You know, until somebody comes out with the real proof and evidence, it\u2019s only a speculation for me.\u201d Tuttosport claimed the allegations were found in documents that are part of an investigation into match-fixing by prosecutors in Cremona but they did not present any of the documents or any other supporting evidence and stressed Djokovic was not under investigation. However, claims of match-fixing aired on the BBC this week have created a fevered atmosphere here among administrators, journalists and players. When Djokovic was further asked to elaborate on the circumstances of the match, he replied: \u201cI\u2019ve lost that match. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re trying to create a story about that match or for that matter any of the matches of the top players losing in the early rounds. I think it\u2019s just absurd.\u201d Djokovic, who was 20 and ranked No3 in the world in 2007, had had his wisdom teeth removed before the Paris Masters. At the time, Djokovic said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t give my 100%, not even 30% of my possibilities. He deserved to win. I\u2019m still on medications. I didn\u2019t practise for a whole week. I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I\u2019m not feeling at all good. It\u2019s been a very long season and I\u2019m really exhausted. I hope people will understand.\u201d Djokovic subsequently complained of exhaustion after losing three matches in a row at the 2007 Masters Cup in Shanghai, the forerunner of the ATP World Tour Finals, now held at the O2 Arena in London. Reminded on Wednesday that the claims about the Santoro match were now in the public domain, he said: \u201cI know. Anybody can create a story about any match. That\u2019s my point. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been too many matches where top players lost in the last decade or so in early rounds. You can pick any match that you like that the top player lost and just create a story out of it. I think it\u2019s not supported by any kind of proof, any evidence, any facts. It\u2019s just speculation. So I don\u2019t think there is a story about it.\u201d It was put to him that the newspaper was saying he had \u201clost on purpose\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he replied. If it were not true, he was asked, would he consider taking action over the claims? \u201cI have nothing more to say, guys. If you have any other questions on any other subject, I\u2019m ready to talk about this. I have nothing more to say.\u201d He concluded the press conference by agreeing with the suggestion that recent stories about match-fixing must sadden him. \u201cYeah, I mean, of course. You don\u2019t want these kind of subjects or speculations going around. I think that certain media is just trying to create a story out of it without any proof.

He next plays the Italian Andreas Seppi, who won 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 against the American Denis Kudla. Halys, slightly built at 6ft 3in, was one of four out of seven original teenagers still in the draw, and looked to have a lot of skills to work with. He could well force his way into the mix of contenders queueing up for a place at the top table.

Despite the fresh sell-off in financial markets on Wednesday, this is far from a done deal. For the doomsday scenario to materialise, China would need to have a hard landing, rather than simply a bumpy one, the rest of the world would have to be ripe for its own crisis, and there would need to be a transmission mechanism for delivering a problem centred on east Asia to the rest of the global economy. For the time being, the theory that the events of the past three weeks herald another 2008-style crisis is just that: a hypothesis. But make no mistake, if the conditions for a recession are right, it would move around the world like a pandemic.   Related: Beware the great 2016 financial crisis, warns leading City pessimist    That, after all, is the essence of globalisation. Economies are far more integrated than they were half a century ago, when capital controls, trade barriers and extensive public ownership shielded national economies. Today, changes in political philosophy and technology mean there are far fewer impediments to the free movement of goods \u2013 and virtually none at all to the free movement of money. So, when one country runs into problems there is always the risk of contagion. That was true of Thailand in 1997, when the collapse of its currency, the baht, quickly had a domino effect across south-east Asia.  It was true also of what appeared to be a local difficulty in a much bigger economy. Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, was dismissive in 2006 of the notion that problems with sub-prime mortgages posed a threat to the American, let alone the global, economy. How wrong he was. Britain\u2019s direct exposure to China is relatively modest. It is not in the top five overseas markets for UK companies, and only 4% of UK goods and services go there. If China\u2019s economy hits the wall, some jobs would be at risk but it would not be nearly as serious as a recession in the United States or the eurozone. The US has more at stake, but even so exports to China account for only 1% of GDP. Britain\u2019s banks are, however, a different story. UK banks \u2013 HSBC and Standard Chartered in particular \u2013 have lent lots of money to China to the extent that they have more at risk than any other country, should the loans turn sour. China has a mountain of bad debts. So how would the crisis manifest itself? One way, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at analysts IHS, would be if China stopped trying to support its currency, the yuan. The result, he says, would be a devaluation of 15-20% that would make China\u2019s exports cheaper but those of every other country more expensive. This would be the opening salvo in a full-blown currency war. Other countries would retaliate and the US would impose trade sanctions on Chinese goods. Deflationary pressure would intensify as Asian countries dumped their excess production on the rest of the world. The UK steel industry has already had a taste of this. China is producing more steel than it needs for its own economic growth and is selling it at cut-price rates. British producers have found it impossible to compete.   Related: China economy grows at slowest pace in 25 years, latest GDP figures show    That, though, would only be the start of the mayhem. Many countries in the emerging world have borrowed heavily in dollars. China itself has $1tn of dollar-denominated debt. If the yuan and other emerging market currencies are devalued, then the value of these dollar debts will rise, putting severe strain on all the affected economies and unbearable strain on the most vulnerable. Zhu Min, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, sketched out in Davos on Wednesday what would happen next. Quite simply, every investor would stampede for the exit at the same time. Liquidity in the global economy would dry up, he said, noting: \u201cThat scares everybody.\u201d It certainly does. Around the concrete bunker hosting the World Economic Forum, the masters of the universe were quietly checking the latest from the financial markets on their smartphones and tablets. A few eyebrows were raised when the Dow\u2019s fall reached 500 points. Chief executives of multinational corporations should not, of course, need to be reminded of global interconnectedness.

In London, the FTSE 100 finished the day down 203 points, or 3.4%, at 5,673, meaning it has fallen more than 20% from its intra-day high of 7122, reached in April last year.  A fall of 20% represents a \u201cbear market\u201d \u2013 one where investors expect further sell-offs. The falls worsened as investors worried about plummeting oil prices. Brent crude oil dropped $1 to $27.7 and US crude headed towards $26 a barrel. Gloomy predictions about the global economy from delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos also played a part in spooking markets, alongside comments from the International Energy Agency on Tuesday that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMP Private Bank, called the collapse \u201ca rest rather than a crash\u201d. He said the decision by the Federal Reserve to raise rates and end its massive financial support of the bond markets last year was finally filtering through to investors. \u201cWe have been building up froth for year with everyone relying on the largesse of central banks,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors don\u2019t feel that the Fed has their back anymore.\u201d The falls have wiped out earlier gains made Tuesday after figures showed growing oil demand from China, as well as hopes the government would introduce further measures to stimulate the world\u2019s second largest economy ahead of the Chinese new year holidays in early February. On top of the slide in the oil price, there are continuing concerns about the strength of the global economy. The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts on Tuesday, blaming a slowdown in China, the falls in commodity prices and the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to start raising US interest rates.  The French CAC, the German Dax and the Shanghai Composite were already in bear market territory, and Japan\u2019s stock market joined them overnight with the Nikkei closing down 3.7%. The CAC lost another 3.5% on Wednesday and the Dax was down 2.8%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has added to the gloom by suggesting it sees no early recovery in iron ore or coal prices. William White, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) review committee and former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, told the Daily Telegraph that the problems building in the global financial system were now \u201cworse than it was in 2007\u201d and warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. A survey for accountancy firm PwC before the Davos meeting revealed that two-thirds of chief executives saw more threats facing their businesses than three years ago, while the head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, added to the angst in Davos by warning that the world was stuck in an era of low growth. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said:  Ugly, very, very ugly, describes current equity markets, with momentum swinging negative yet again and the bears firmly in control. The fledgling hope from yesterday that markets were on the turn has been quashed by sharp overnight falls in Japan and Asia, which has seen European markets fall aggressively. With every upturn being followed by deeper falls, investors are increasingly wary as it becomes more and more difficult to determine what might happen next. Oil prices remain under pressure, but the consumer benefits of lower energy prices and higher disposable income have yet to filter through to the wider equity market, which remains unremittingly negative in the face of further prospective asset sales by oil exporting countries\u2019 sovereign wealth funds.

As world and business leaders gathered for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the FTSE 100 was gripped by panic selling, especially of mining and oil companies that have been hit hard by the global slowdown in manufacturing and trade. Earlier this week, China recorded the slowest rate of economic growth for 25 years. The index dropped more than 200 points to finish the day down more than 20% from its peak of 7,122, reached in April last year. Such a 20% decline marks the beginning of a bear market. In New York, shares on the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 249 points down (1.56%), recovering from a 550-point-drop earlier in the day, while Brent crude dropped to $27.78 a barrel \u2013 down by about 70% from its summer 2014 level of $115 a barrel.   Related: If this market turmoil forces a US rate cut, the outlook will truly be grim    Stock markets in Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia also dived as concerns mounted that countries already badly hit by the fall in oil prices could be forced to dip further into reserves to prevent an economic crisis. Global equities have had their worst start to a year on record. William White, a former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers\u2019 club, who now chairs the OECD\u2019s review committee warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. \u201cThe situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up. Debts have continued to build up over the past eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief,\u201d he said on the eve of the event. The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash.  Concerns that the global recovery could be derailed began last summer when a devaluation of the Chinese currency caused a meltdown on the Shanghai stock exchange. A series of economic downgrades to the Chinese and US economies since then, coupled with a rise in US interest rates, have fuelled investors\u2019 misgivings about optimistic forecasts for a recovery in economic fortunes. Adding to the concerns of a sharp downgrade in global growth this year, a survey for the consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers before the Davos meeting revealed that two-thirds of chief executives saw more threats facing their businesses than three years ago. And the head of the Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, turned the screw by warning that the world was stuck in an era of low growth. Last week, an investment analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland advised clients to \u201csell everything\u201d except the safest high grade bonds after warning of a \u201ccataclysmic\u201d year and the strong likelihood of a stock market crash. His comments came after the British chancellor, George Osborne, warned in a new year speech of a \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d to the UK\u2019s prospects from an increasingly uncertain world economy.  Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist at consultancy IHS, blamed the Chinese authorities for triggering the global panic. \u201cThe big event that I think has captured everyone\u2019s attention is the developments in China and in particular the fact that growth is slowing,\u201d he said. The Chinese policymakers had fumbled, he said. \u201cThey have made some mistakes. And they have added to the uncertainty and the volatility by their behaviour.\u201d Others blamed the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, for raising interest rates in December to 0.5% when growth was already faltering, increasing borrowing costs to US businesses and encouraging an influx of funds, especially from China.   Related: Apocalypse now: has the next giant financial crash already begun?    However, Nouriel Roubini, who was even more vocal than the BIS in warning of the 2008 crash, said that the threat of a crash was overplayed: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 was going to be a bumpy year until central banks responded with extra stimulus, he warned, saying: \u201cThe big thing that should happen is [that] China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European economics commissioner, said central banks retained some firepower to prevent another crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address,\u201d he said. Maurice Obstfeld, the chief economist at the IMF, said he was concerned that central banks were held back by concerns that an extra stimulus would cause more inflation in a couple of years. \u201cCentral banks should be more relaxed about overshooting their inflation targets and more concerned about deflationary pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in an environment where there is growing concern that inflation expectations are not firmly anchored. So there should be much more concern about deflation.\u201d Among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 were international mining groups, whose business has been particularly hit by the slowdown in China as demand for industrial basics such as iron ore and copper has fallen rapidly.  The biggest loser was miner and commodities trading group Glencore, whose shares tumbled nearly 10% to 71p. Less than two years ago, they were changing hands at 375p.

The bad news is that 10 points from six league games is probably not a start that is going to close the gap on the top four \u2013 which stands at 14 points. The FA Cup remains a possibility but, unless Chelsea somehow win the Champions League, a change of manager alone will not have been enough to salvage the season. The collapse of the champions is unprecedented in the Premier League era (which in this instance is a useful shorthand for saying since the economics of football dictated a self-perpetuating elite and rigid stratification). It is not necessarily to deny that Mourinho had become a toxic presence to point out that when something is not working at a club, the easiest solution is to sack the manager, who becomes a scapegoat, his slaughter symbolically absolving his people.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho enters politics by backing \u2018charismatic\u2019 presidential candidate    It is a ritual that has been enacted, as James Frazer demonstrates in The Golden Bough, by various groups with various degrees of literalness for millennia. In The Manager Barney Ronay essentially argues that the role was invented to insulate the board of directors from blame. There is a growing body of thought that believes that the manager is not as significant as football has made him. In Why England Lose, for instance, Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski argue that, in the 10 years beginning in 1998, a club\u2019s total wage spend accounted for 89% of the variation in its average position in the league table. In The Numbers Game Chris Anderson and David Sally consider the decade from 2001-02 to 2010-11 and conclude that the actual figure is 81% \u2013 that a manager accounts for, at most, 19% of where a team finishes in the league. The lesson appears to be that a club should concentrate its spending on players rather than the manager \u2013 the corollary, perhaps, being the argument that Chelsea\u2019s struggles this season have been largely caused by transfer spending \u2013 a point Mourinho himself made obliquely at times and that is highlighted by the lack of attacking cover. Perhaps that is true. But if we really have been deluded since the days of Herbert Chapman by the mystique of the manager, conforming, perhaps to Thomas Carlyle\u2019s Great Man theory of history, there are some curiosities to consider. Only four managers (Tom Watson, Chapman, Brian Clough and Kenny Dalglish) have won the league with more than one club. It is true that managers used not to move as much as they do now, but that still suggests that it is rare for the right manager to find himself with the right players in the right circumstances. Perhaps even more striking is that the same number of managers have won the league with Chelsea (Ted Drake, Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti) as with Manchester United (Ernest Mangnall, Matt Busby, Alex Ferguson), despite United having been an economically powerful club for far more of their history than Chelsea. That suggests that even when conditions are favourable, it requires a certain genius to take advantage (it may be, of course, that, if the analysis were extended backwards to when the disparity between the richest and poorest was less pronounced, wage spending would be less significant. And wage spending of course, includes spending on the manager\u2019s wages). Richer clubs can hire better managers, just as they can hire better players: that there is a strong correlation between league position and wage spending then becomes at least partly a reflection of the quality of the manager.     Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in Shanghai earlier this week. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex Shutterstock    But perhaps most significant is that the issues of wage spending and managerial quality are not discrete. How a player performs under a manager in part determines his wages. And in a very general sense the better the manager the more money there is to spend. Over time, as anybody would expect, the wealthy tend to prosper. As Sally and Anderson point out, what is more significant \u2013 for once \u2013 is to take a smaller sample size and look at fluctuation from season to season. Between Mourinho\u2019s first spell and Mourinho\u2019s second spell Chelsea had five permanent managers, all working with roughly similar resources. Only one, Ancelotti, managed to do what Mourinho did in both spells and win the league, something that tends to confirm Mourinho\u2019s specialness. Yet despite that, Mourinho\u2019s history, his regular failings in his third season at a club and the rumours leaking from the dressing room all supported his dismissal; the sense was of an irreconcilable fracture between the manager and at least some of his squad. The question then is why there is such disparity between how Chelsea played last season and how they are playing this? There were those who saw in the apparent disparity between Chelsea\u2019s performances in the Champions League and the Premier League evidence that their players had simply stopped playing for Mourinho. Perhaps that is true and it may be that, had Mourinho still been there, they would not have had the fight to get back (twice) into Saturday\u2019s game against Everton.   Related: The devil and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho | Jonathan Wilson    But the broader question is about how they fell 2-0 and 3-2 behind in the first place. For long periods on Saturday Chelsea were dreadful. It may be that the players regard the league as a lost cause and, so long as they do not get relegated, they cannot raise themselves to try to battle for eighth, and that a better Chelsea will emerge in the FA Cup and the Champions League (much as it did in 2012 when Chelsea won the competition in the midst of some very ordinary league form). And the worry for Chelsea must be that the point Mourinho made after the defeat at Leicester in what turned out to be his last game as manager turns out to be correct. What if we are seeing not a great squad being brought low by a fractious relationship with their manager but their true level? What if it was only Mourinho\u2019s genius that elevated them last season? Even if that is only partially accepted, another change of manager in the summer will probably not be enough. This is about the 81%, the players and how the squad is constructed, as much as it is about the 19%.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-21T13:42:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/21/the-fiver-andros-townsend-tottenham", "sentences": ["\u201cWe\u2019re having a terrific season, but we\u2019re experiencing a lull right now.\u201d Maverick Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande have given an intriguing reason for allowing top scorer Elkeson to jump ship to Shanghai SIPG."], "title": "The Fiver | The Spurs fan with a knack for noticing things while skipping", "article": "ANDROS AND THE OCHE During the course of our extensive research for today\u2019s daily dose of biting football satire, The Fiver made an intriguing discovery: Michael McIntyre gave copies of his own comedy DVD as Christmas presents to chums in the world of football.

Older Fiver readers may remember Townsend as a former Spurs winger who, unique among former Spurs wingers, still happens to be employed and paid by Spurs. Latterly, however, he is more famous for going to the darts a lot, attending European movie premieres and being as highly amused as everyone else when his girlfriend mistook a Football Manager screen-grab about him being fined for missing training she\u2019d seen on Twitter for actual news and demanded an explanation. Having always considered Andros a potential chum we haven\u2019t yet met and never will, The Fiver can\u2019t help but feel sorry for him at this, his lowest ebb. Yes, kicking back at the arrers before taking your favourite walk-on girl to a screening of Creed is all well and good, but it seems a rather hollow existence [It does? \u2013 Fiver Ed] when in his heart he secretly yearns to skip McIntyre-style down a touchline with a football at his feet living out his boyhood dream. For Andros, the dream has become a nightmare, with his boss Mauricio Pochettino having all but declared he has no future at White Hart Lane after forcing him to train with the reserves. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious the situation for Andros,\u201d said Poch, upon being asked if the 24-year-old had already played his last game for the club. \u201cIt\u2019s always about rumours but it is true that it\u2019s obvious when some players are not too much involved in the games, the player always wants to play to try to find the solution.\u201d In recent days, it looked like Newcastle might ride to the rescue in a deal that would ensure Townsend got regular first-team football in a side about equal in ability to the kids \u2018n\u2019 stiffs outfit for whom he is currently forced to play. Sadly for Andros, with both clubs having failed to reach an agreement over his transfer fee, it seems Newcastle have ended their interest abruptly.

Since Fufeng\u2019s owners declared bankruptcy early last year \u2013 laying off about 2,000 workers and sparking protests in the process \u2013 weeds and rust have begun to consume the steel mill\u2019s industrial ruins. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody here \u2013 just us,\u201d said one of three security guards braving snow and sub-zero temperatures to watch over the dilapidated facility, which, like many others in the region, has been forced out of business by massive over-capacity and plummeting demand.      A steel mill seen through the broken window of an abandoned residential building in Tangshan. Photograph: Petar Kujundzic/Reuters    Tangshan, a city of about seven million inhabitants in Hebei, China\u2019s steel-making heartlands, was levelled by a devastating 1976 earthquake that is said to have claimed 250,000 lives. But it rose from the ashes to become a heavy-industry powerhouse, propping up a massive Chinese construction boom and churning out more steel in 2014 than the United States.  Those days now appear over, as concerns mount over the health of China\u2019s economy and its possible impact on the rest of the world, and Beijing fights to reinvent the world\u2019s second-largest economy and clear its smog-choked skies, in turn piling the pressure on heavily polluting steel plants.  Since China began ramping up efforts to slash steel over-capacity and transition to a more sustainable, consumption-led economic model, some corners of Tangshan\u2019s once bustling industrial sprawl have taken on the appearance of ghost towns.  Near the Fufeng plant, homes vacated by laid-off workers have been sealed up with metal sheets, snowflakes fall on eerily deserted streets, and those steelworkers who still have jobs complain their salaries have been cut as steel prices fall, government support is withdrawn, and their employers struggle to stay afloat. A few hundred metres beyond the shuttered Fufeng complex, the premises of another company, China Metallurgical Hengtong Cold Rolled Technology, also lies abandoned, electricity cables drooping on to a corrugated iron fence blocking its unused entrance.     A man walks past shuttered businesses near the abandoned Fufeng steel plant in Tangshan which closed last year leaving 2,000 people out of work. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    \u201cThings are bleak,\u201d said one retired mill worker who lives in Kua Number One village, just beside Fufeng. Another man, who works at the nearby Guofeng mill, which is still operating, but only just, claimed his monthly pay had been cut by 25%. \u201cLife is really hard right now,\u201d he complained.  \u201cEverything here is about steel. If it shuts down, it\u2019s over. If our mill closes, we will have no land, no money and no work,\u201d said the 52-year-old father of one, who declined to give his name.    Declining value of Chinese steel exports Declining value of Chinese steel exports   This week, China announced that its economy last year grew at its slowest rate in 25 years, contributing to fears of an accelerated slowdown that could affect financial markets across the world.  On Thursday, Fang Xinghai, a Stanford-educated top economic adviser to president Xi Jinping, attempted to reassure the world over his country\u2019s ability to avoid a hard landing that would have severe consequences for the global economy.  \u201cChina is blessed with the strong and long-term focused leadership of President Xi Jinping, the best leader in the world,\u201d Fang, the former deputy head of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWith his leadership, we can deal with the inevitable risks and volatilities arising out of the transition.\u201d He added: \u201cThe transition speed is perhaps not fast enough for some people, but quite fast indeed for a country the size of China, and this process of transition will continue.\u201d But in the wake of last year\u2019s stock market debacle and another recent bout of jitters, which experts blamed on the government\u2019s confused policies, there is increasing scepticism over the ability of President Xi and prime minister Li Keqiang to handle the economic challenges ahead.     All eyes are on Chinese president Xi Jinping, left, and prime minister Li Keqiang. Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP    Patrick Chovanec, a China expert and chief strategist at New York\u2019s Silvercrest Asset Management, said: \u201cWhen you see things that make them look like their policy footing is uncertain, people who are betting on the government to determine the outcome get nervous [and think], \u2018Well, if their policy footing is uncertain about the exchange rate, maybe it is uncertain about the stock market or about the property market or about other things.\u2019 It makes you wonder.\u201d Chovanec said one major concern was the apparent sidelining of Li Keqiang, who was supposedly in charge of China\u2019s economic re-balancing.  \u201cThe impression that a lot of people have is that Li isn\u2019t really the decision maker, and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time, and that everything has been centred on Xi,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the reins have been held in one hand which \u2013 even if it was a very competent hand \u2013 would be potentially problematic given the full plate of challenges that they face and the full plate of reforms that they say they are interested in implementing.\u201d While China\u2019s leaders struggle to control their country\u2019s economic transition, Tangshan\u2019s residents are left to reminisce about the golden era of double-digit growth.     People are consuming less in hard-hit areas of China. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Fan Jiangqiang, 47, a local entrepreneur, said the region\u2019s halcyon days had come in 2008 and 2009 when China\u2019s galloping economy saw steel consumption soar and the acrid smoke above his home signalled that business was booming.  \u201cThe supermarkets were always full of people. Many businesses opened up. People would go out to karaoke and for drinks. People consumed a lot,\u201d Fan recalled.  \u201c[But] right now, things just keep going down. More and more companies are going bankrupt,\u201d he said. Cui Jianjun, a 46-year-old chicken salesman who works in the shadow of the once bustling Fufeng plant, said: \u201cWhen the mills were operating properly lots of migrants would come here to work. Now the mills have closed, they\u2019ve gone home. My business has suffered.\u201d China\u2019s flagging economy is already taking a punishing toll on the country\u2019s workforce.  China Labour Bulletin (CLB), a Hong Kong-based campaigning group which monitors such unrest, recorded a dramatic escalation in strikes and worker protests towards the end of last year. Across China there were 2,774 incidents in 2015, double the previous year\u2019s figure of 1,379 incidents.  \u201cAll sectors of the economy are clearly experiencing problems,\u201d said CLB\u2019s Geoff Crothall. \u201cAnd the reason the workers are going out on strike and staging protests is simply that they have no other option.\u201d  Crothall said that of the 51 \u201cincidents\u201d in Hebei province last year, 15 had been related to the depressed steel industry, with a very clear upsurge in the last quarter of 2015. One of those protests took place outside the gates of the Fufeng steel mill, where disgruntled former workers gathered to demand unpaid wages.  Video footage posted on the internet shows police facing off with demonstrators, one of whom is dragged away from the scene.             As world leaders and the global business elite gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, a group of steel workers huddled inside a small supermarket-cum-gambling den not far from Fufeng to smoke cigarettes and ponder their fates. \u201cIt all depends on the government. If the government wants us to survive, we will live on,\u201d said the 52-year-old worker. \u201cIf the government says no, we will close.\u201d  Another man attempted to lighten the mood with a joke. There was one major upside to all the economic gloom, he pointed out, letting out a loud guffaw. \u201cThe air is much better these days.\u201d  Additional reporting by Christy Yao", "tags": ["China", "Steel industry", "World news", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "Xi Jinping", "Li Keqiang", "Economics", "Cities"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-21T23:24:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/22/inside-story-india-smart-city-gold-rush-it", "sentences": ["If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai, it will be a gated community  Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan     Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan, a local architect, was disapproving: \u201cI don\u2019t think a consultant coming from outside can draw a plan for Trichy in the next 10 or 20 years.", "If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai \u2026 it will be a gated community.\u201d The proposal for Tiruchirappalli was less gated community, more a weird mix of marketing speak and emotional pandering."], "title": "'We don't need IT here': the inside story of India\u2019s smart city gold rush", "article": "In the final days of India\u2019s first Smart City Challenge \u2013 an endeavour both ambitious and suspect \u2013 consultants just wanted the whole thing done with. As the December deadline for submissions approached, they crisscrossed the country holding on to nearly finished plans and proposals for the cities they had been assigned just two months earlier.  Their documents evoked those familiar, romantic overtures of urban development: constant electricity and an endless flow of water, cyclists with their own avenues, renewed rivers and promenades for families to enjoy each evening, and streetlights that sensed when they were needed. The effects would be felt far beyond the limited geography of each smart city, the consultants thought.  Pashim Tiwari, an urban planner working with the All India Institute of Local Self-Government, was among those who sensed change. The 98-year-old organisation had been assigned two prospective smart cities in the state of Haryana, and two in Chhattisgarh. Tiwari was in charge of the projects. With barely two weeks left until the deadline, he knew his way around government offices \u2013 armed guards would step aside when he approached the cabins of powerful officials. When the team\u2019s senior members went home now and then, their wives would reintroduce them to their children. The extreme pressure of the two-month deadline engendered a rare spirit of cooperation. Legions of city officials were free to find obscure information the planners required. \u201cCity managers have become more aware of their cities. Most weren\u2019t aware of the strengths and weaknesses \u2013 now, for the first time, this kind of thinking is getting institutionalised,\u201d Tiwari said thoughtfully one morning in Bilaspur, one of the two smart city prospects in Chhattisgarh. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before.\u201d     \u2018They\u2019ve ignored this place for so long ...\u2019 Bilaspur is one of the two smart city prospects in Chhattisgarh. Photograph: Mint/Hindustan Times via Getty Images    Outside, a roundabout dedicated to Jawaharlal Nehru wore political hoardings concealing India\u2019s first prime minister, and tinny speakers broadcast instrumental music from the 1950s. Wires \u2013 electrical, cables \u2013 hung over the low buildings like unruly hair. Store owners swept rubbish into piles left on the streets, and cows gathered around the biggest mounds. The town\u2019s pavement designs were a choice left to building owners.  Tiwari had arrived in Bilaspur from New Delhi early that December morning, wearing a sweater. The temperature outside was 30C. His eyes were glassy, and his cough was in no way helped by the coal dust carried into the city by slow winds. At the town\u2019s municipal headquarters, Tiwari spent his waking hours creating the town\u2019s smart city proposal with a team of young planners. \u201cThey aren\u2019t jaded by city policies yet,\u201d he grinned.  Bilaspur\u2019s municipal commissioner had vacated a conference room for this youthful team. Other than a few sofas and coffee tables cloistered in one corner, the room was bereft of fixtures, but thousands of questionnaires were stacked along one wall. Tiwari explained that more than 70 \u201curban local bodies\u201d (arms of government responsible for civic works) had conducted 35,000 detailed interviews for this single proposal.     Part of Bilaspur\u2019s smart city plan    Citizens had been asked to rate the government\u2019s accessibility, the town\u2019s cleanliness, broadband penetration, mobile connectivity, sewerage, and safety and security on a scale of one to five. Tiwari asked for a sample from the file. The respondent had suggested, in a mix of Hindi and English, \u201ca separate lane for emergency vehicles so that lives can be saved\u201d. Asked which part of the city they wanted rejuvenated for the smart cities project, a substantial number of people mentioned the Arpa river around which the town had grown. Because citizens wanted it, the planners\u2019 proposal would focus on the river. The whole smart cities endeavour, after all, was about what the citizens of India wanted. Tiwari believes that smart cities could fix the problems of regular cities. \u201cThe city can now run as a public limited company,\u201d he said, happily. \u201cWhen you look at a city that way, the moment the valuation increases, municipal bonds become a reality. I\u2019ll give you an example: city surveillance is amazingly viable in larger towns. If you have houses paying a small amount, you could have enough cameras to have an effective city surveillance network. And not one handled by the government, but by private companies.\u201d Like every other consultant vying for the government\u2019s approval, Tiwari had followed the rules and was preparing two plans for each of his cities. One detailed the ideas and budgets for a small area within the city; the other was an invisible technological grid laid over the entire city. Tiwari\u2019s team proposed a bespoke, city-wide digital operating system: \u201cIt will have electricity, water, healthcare, birth-death, credit card data, traffic licensing, penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a city official, if dengue season is approaching, you\u2019ll get alerts reminding you that you have to put out particular tenders.\u201d Tiwari believes that, eventually, everybody will come to see the benefit of living in a \u201csmart area\u201d, and be willing to pay for it. He described a world where all the city\u2019s residents, from slum residents to the occupants of penthouses, could use services online \u2013 where electrical connections were easy to procure, and all kinds of payments could be made by phone or at a kiosk. A world of blissful information technology. \u201cWe realised that even in slums, people will pay nominally more for improved services. [With our system] everyone is able to access any resource if he is able to pay for it. Every citizen has the opportunity to access data for his survival and upliftment.\u201d     A model at the Smartcity Expo in New Delhi. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images    A mile or two east of Bilaspur\u2019s municipal headquarters, at the banks of the Arpa river, are where the trash returns to town. I walked there the day after meeting Tiwari and saw a boy who was squatting behind a mound of trash, scoop up handfuls of acrid water to rinse himself. Cannonballing children leapt off a pipe jutting above the river\u2019s surface. On the administration\u2019s side of the river, where nicer buildings are located, a woman in a burkha came down the bank, passing pigs and an immobile drunk. She hitched up the hem of her clothing, and trod carefully on a submerged path through the treacly stream. The full details of the new city plan were still unknown to residents of Bilaspur, but as often happens, the more ominous parts were beginning to leak out. Tiwari said that land around the river would be acquired for the smart city. In exchange, residents would receive another plot nearby: a third of the size of the land they gave up, but according to him, worth much more with the knock-on effects of the smart city. \u201cIt is quite lucrative for people to give.\u201d \u201cDuring Indira Gandhi\u2019s time, they promised us a bridge here,\u201d said a man living beside the river, who declined to give his name. \u201cThey\u2019ve ignored this place for so long, and now we\u2019ve heard they\u2019re breaking everything.\u201d As he spoke, a boy rode up on a bicycle, wearing only red underwear. He stopped at the river\u2019s edge and stared across, chewing a small red rag. \u201cLook at this addict,\u201d the man said, as the boy turned to go. \u201cSmell his rag.\u201d The cloth the boy was chewing reeked of turpentine. \u201cLook at his chest \u2013 it will curve inward. All this will go inside him and his insides will get stuck. He will die before he is 24.\u201d The boy, aged 14, nodded his head in agreement; he looked like he wanted someone to find him a place in the world. Then he mounted his cycle, rode it into the river, and fell off.  Making a smart city In February 2015, the Indian government announced that Bloomberg Philanthropies, the urban-focused charitable foundation set up by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, was to help the Ministry of Urban Development develop a means of identifying Indian cities that could be made \u201csmarter\u201d. Through Bloomberg\u2019s connections, local officials could reach out to experts elsewhere.    City managers have become more aware of their cities. Most weren\u2019t aware of the strengths and weaknesses  Pashim Tiwari     \u201cThis approach is different,\u201d the government\u2019s release said. \u201cIt will ensure that real citizen engagement happens, as people get involved both in design and execution of city development plans.\u201d  Each competing city had official webpages on a government-run website, where citizens were asked what kind of smart city they desired. The responses included working streetlights, better roads, regular garbage collection \u2013 the stuff of regular civic life.  Bloomberg Philanthropies has said its aims would include giving \u201clocal officials \u2026 broad flexibility to develop approaches\u201d that answered local needs. A Bloomberg video explains: \u201cSmart cities are about clustering smart people, smart institutions, and creating an economic model that can evolve with time.\u201d Last August, a shortlist of 98 cities was announced. Before the end of January, the first 20 winners of the smart city challenge will be revealed. A further 40 smart cities will be chosen the following year, and 40 more will follow the year after. Together, they will draw on the $100m funds from the smart city programme over five years. The funding will increase substantially with matching funds from each state, and other government schemes to utilise. But greater than this competition is the pull of history: smart cities have long been imagined, but never defined. To help create the model, technology companies have forged smart city agreements, hosted smart city conferences, and arranged smart city meetings. In Bilaspur, Cisco said it would charge the town \u00a32.6m for an information and communication technology platform. In addition, the planners had budgeted \u00a36.7m to lay broadband fibre. Meetings were arranged with Siemens. \u201cEven Google\u2019s getting into smart cities,\u201d said one planner.     How the \u2018Aerotropolis\u2019 at Durgapur, West Bengal, might look. As of now, it consists of a runway, a terminal, and roads surrounded by fields. Photograph: Townland    Elsewhere, Microsoft, Ashoka University and the Indian School of Business have begun a \u201cventure accelerator programme\u201d focused on smart city solutions. Dheeraj Batra, who heads the business school\u2019s incubator, said the accelerator would take a \u201cvery broad approach\u201d to smart cities. Asked why the school decided to focus on smart cities instead of regular ones, Batra said: \u201cHonestly, the smart cities idea gives these startups a better chance at success.\u201d To create the proposals, cities signed up a raft of international consultants: McKinsey &amp; Company, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Indian firms Infosys and Tata, and Aecom, a consultancy conglomerate whose revenues doubled from the previous year to $18bn in 2015. Cautionary stories circulated: in one of the largest corporate settlements in Australia, for example, Aecom settled for $201m for exaggerated traffic forecasts for a failed toll road.  There are others, such as \u201cAerotropolis\u201d, a sprawling real-estate project in West Bengal marketed as India\u2019s first airport metropolis. As of now, it consists of a runway, a terminal, and roads surrounded by fields. Townland, the international consultancy (with headquarters in Hong Kong) behind Aerotropolis, is now one of the official consultants for Tiruchirappalli, a city in Tamil Nadu which is also known as Trichy. At a mandatory hearing with local stakeholders, the consultants were viewed as outsiders who couldn\u2019t come to terms with this culture of the ancient temple town.    If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai, it will be a gated community  Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan     Vijaykumar Sengottuvelan, a local architect, was disapproving: \u201cI don\u2019t think a consultant coming from outside can draw a plan for Trichy in the next 10 or 20 years. They\u2019re totally unfamiliar with the nuances and identity of the place. They\u2019re not able to tell the difference between Trichy and [the neighbouring city of] Madhurai. They asked me what made Trichy unique,\u201d he said, seemingly a breath away from adding: \u201cthe heathens\u201d.  Sengottuvelan agreed to be interviewed soon after a smart city consultation with citizens had been held. \u201cThey said the city will have IT companies,\u201d he explained.  At the meeting, he and other stakeholders worried about the proposal. \u201cWe said that the identity of the city should be respected; that whatever development has to happen should focus on strengthening these identities, rather than making every city the same. If you\u2019re going to think of smart cities only like they\u2019re Dubai or Shanghai \u2026 it will be a gated community.\u201d The proposal for Tiruchirappalli was less gated community, more a weird mix of marketing speak and emotional pandering. Residents were promised \u201cenhanced last-mile connectivity\u201d, an \u201cintegrated bus stand with sky walk\u201d, digital signage, \u201cemployment opportunity for [the] economically weaker section\u201d, and health monitoring apps \u201cespecially for pregnant ladies\u201d.     Wired city: chaotic electricity cables in Old Delhi. Photograph: Arkaprava Ghosh/Barcroft India    But Sengottuvelan believed that the public hearings, a crucial part of the smart city challenge, were a facade: \u201cThe hearings give a false impression that things are transparent.\u201d He believed the agenda for smart cities had already been set, and the exercise was about the application of information technology for benefits that were unclear.  \u201cAs stakeholders, we know what the city lacks. But in their presentation, they said that technology would be used to stop electricity theft, and there will be CCTV on the streets, and they were talking about an app that tells you where parking is available.\u201d The thought left him cold. \u201cMy suspicion is that they have already developed technology, and are looking for a place where they can sell it en masse.\u201d  The decision process The question about technology\u2019s dominance in smart cities is surely the tip of a deeper concern: who decides what a city\u2019s priorities should be? In 1992, an amendment to India\u2019s constitution devolved power to city governments. People affected by city life, the thinking went, should have a say in city affairs. The urban ministry\u2019s approach to smart cities swings the other way. \u201cThe cities programme nudges us toward information technology, rather than local government,\u201d said Pavan Srinath, the head of policy research at the Takshashila Institution. Sensing that the mission to create smart cities was an important moment in urban governance, Srinath has led the thinktank\u2019s study of the endeavour from 2014: \u201cYou have to ask, is the smart cities mission furthering local government, or putting a spanner in it? \u201cI think, for a city like New York, where problems have been solved, putting sensors on sewage pipes is a wonderful idea. For India ... \u201d his voice trailed off, leaving scepticism to fill the void. \u201cI think what the conversation needs to be about is what is smart for your city, for your area.\u201d    Related: Delhi Mumbai Corridor: how the world's largest infrastructure project is uprooting Indian farmers    The planners and architects I met, who initially saw the smart cities programme as an opportunity to examine the deficiencies of existing cities, also feared the course it seemed to be taking. \u201cWe have the opportunity to not make mistakes,\u201d Biju Kuriakose, a Chennai architect, said. \u201cBut you have an American in Indonesia as the consultant for Trichy. The logic is, they know smart cities. But consultants look at cities with a spreadsheet, and walk around with their 10 bullet points about sustainability.\u201d In Raipur, a two-hour drive from Bilaspur, in a mouldy room at the district headquarters, the consultants frowned at their spreadsheets; the numbers were startlingly small. A junior planner, one of the group\u2019s workhorses, read out the cost of touchscreen kiosks and his manager, a senior planner, smiled. \u201c35,000 rupees for a touch display is not possible. It\u2019s at least 600,000 rupees.\u201d Tiwari stretched out on a chair, conserving his energy for later presentations. These final days of the bidding process involved winning the approval of the people most likely to be affected by the smart cities programme: government employees. The next meeting was two hours away. \u201cEveryone is creating their own platform,\u201d Tiwari said. \u201cCisco is, Microsoft is, IBM is, Infosys is. The question is, who is going to deliver the right mix? The trick is not technology so much as understanding the regulatory system and the user system, and then creating middleware in a manner that can integrate both of them with appropriate technology.\u201d  Tiwari said the organisation he worked for hoped to lay a fibre network and leave the very last stretch, the part that reached homes and offices, open to whatever technology people adopted. \u201cThe network will belong to the governing company. If any private company has an application they want to put on it, we\u2019ll ask them to pay an access charge.\u201d Tiwari\u2019s phone kept buzzing in the silence. He answered every call. On a wall behind the planners, a diagram consisting of clouds and arrows reminded them that technology, energy, people and the economy were bound to each other.  Tiwari is comfortable with technology\u2019s complexities. \u201cI had access to tech a long time ago. Always. Others did too, but they weren\u2019t enamoured by it. We had a BBC Micro in college.\u201d He was fascinated by the Raspberry Pi, and said that the openness of his smart city system would allow citizens to plug in devices such as the Pi for their own use. The vision was appealing: the city as a programmable device.     The humble smart city planning office in Raipur. Photograph: Rahul Bhatia    At a quarter to six, a man stuck his head into the room. \u201cYou can go in now. He\u2019s waiting.\u201d The office of the municipal commissioner, a powerful administrative official, was a floor below. In an enormous room, behind an enormous desk, sat a muscular man no older than 40. He was dressed in a grey shirt and beige jacket. He held documents with one hand, and used the other to smoothe his hair. The plan did not make him happy. Tiwari shifted forward on his chair, eager to respond to any problem the commissioner brought up. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he began, \u201cthe ministry has said that for the pan-city solution, no costs on infrastructure should be incurred. They will only approve websites, information technology. It could be a traffic solution also.\u201d This struck the commissioner as mad, and so inconceivable, that he stuttered: \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? We don\u2019t need information technology here.\u201d An assistant agreed: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe need money for flyovers here ... \u201d \u201cWe need those flyovers,\u201d the assistant repeated. \u201cSir, it\u2019s your party that has done ... \u201d Tiwari interjected, referring to the Smart City Challenge\u2019s driving force, the National Democratic Alliance, which forms India\u2019s present government. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been out on the streets, but we need wider roads, flyovers, proper pathways.\u201d The commissioner scoffed: \u201cHalf these things we don\u2019t understand: \u2018Intelligent traffic solutions \u2026 \u2019\u201d    Related: From Singapore to Amaravati: the battle to build India's new state capital    He put down the proposal. \u201cI wanted something we could implement immediately. I don\u2019t see any of that here. And what you\u2019ve proposed for the smart city area is very difficult. It involves a lot of demolition work.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to give responsibility to a software company. You\u2019ve written that the company will look at traffic violations, number plate registrations, handle the CCTV control room. But all this is the police\u2019s jurisdiction. You\u2019re saying they will do our job. We will have no powers left to enforce anything.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge for everyone, but the system that has been devised is just this,\u201d Tiwari replied, sounding frustrated. \u201cLook at this,\u201d the commissioner continued, engrossed in this vision of an alternate world where his post was irrelevant. \u201cIT tools for automatic speed detection.\u201d He looked at Tiwari, aghast. \u201cThere\u2019s no work for us here.\u201d At the end of the meeting, Tiwari left the enormous room in silence, walked upstairs slowly, and pushed open the door with a \u201csmart cities\u201d printout stuck on it. Briefly, only for an instant, his optimism failed him.  \u201cIt\u2019s been like this,\u201d he said, before catching himself. \u201cIf you look at other countries at a similar stage in their history, we\u2019re doing really well.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion  This article was updated on 26 January to clarify that Townland is an international consultancy with headquarters in Hong Kong ", "tags": ["Cities", "Smart cities", "Technology", "India", "World news", "South and Central Asia"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-22T06:30:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/22/football-transfer-rumours-pep-guardiola-manage-manchester-united", "sentences": ["And it could get much worse: Jon Obi Mikel is being courted by Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s Shanghai SIPG, who would be prepared to put up \u00a360,000 a week in net wages and a \u00a36m transfer fee."], "title": "Football transfer rumours: Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis off to Newcastle?", "article": "Where would you stage a clandestine meeting, if the mood took you?

Exactly the kind of obscure location you\u2019d seek out to undercut your local rivals in snaring the world\u2019s hottest managerial property, but if the story \u2013 which United have denied \u2013 is true then Manchester City will have to stage something pretty spectacularly top secret themselves to lure back their objet d\u2019amour.

US, European and Asian markets all rallied after weeks of losses as oil prices rose and policy makers pledged more support for the economy.  It was European Central Bank president Mario Draghi who provided the greatest boost to stock prices after his hint on Thursday that more money printing and interest rate cuts could be around the corner. That sparked a relief rally in European and US stock markets which continued into Friday and helped London\u2019s FTSE 100 index clock up its first week of gains this year. In New York US stock markets managed their first week of gains this year as the bounce back in oil prices lifted energy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 210 points, 1.3%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.7%. UK chancellor George Osborne called for \u201ccool heads\u201d while Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the outlook for the world economy had not changed despite a dramatic start to 2016 on financial markets that has seen trillions of dollars wiped off the value of global shares amid panic selling and a slide in oil prices. A cold snap in parts of Europe and the US also helped oil prices rebound to $32 a barrel after they had plumbed 13-year lows below $28 earlier this week. Oil, other commodity prices and shares have all been under pressure in recent weeks as investors fret about a slowdown in global growth and signs of weakness from economic heavyweight China.   FTSE 100 FTSE 100   At the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Osborne claimed the UK was a \u201cbright spot\u201d in the world economy. But amid signs Britain\u2019s economy was losing steam he sought to shift the focus to external forces, repeating a warning that the UK faced a \u201cdangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy\u201d. Speaking to UK business leaders at a lunch with the CBI lobby group, Osborne said: \u201cWe have been a chink of light cutting through the global gloom. But that gloomy backdrop means we cannot rest or become complacent.\u201d In a thinly veiled attack on opposition politicians calling for a let-up in spending cuts, Osborne added: \u201cWe need to continue to implement our long term economic plan. We need to keep cool heads as the market heats up.\u201d Carney has been less sanguine over the state of Britain\u2019s economy and earlier this week sent clear hints to financial markets that interest rates would be held at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come against the backdrop of a weaker world economy and a slowdown in the UK. On Friday, Carney used a newspaper interview to play down fears that volatility on financial markets would further dampen the economic outlook. He told the Wall Street Journal that the Bank\u2019s forecast in November was already below the consensus and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s outlook. \u201cIt is a pretty modest world. It is a low 3 [%] growth world the next few years. Embedded in that was a fairly sharp markdown of emerging markets and downside risks. Recent events are just reinforcing that. I don\u2019t think they have fundamentally changed that trajectory,\u201d he said. Panic selling earlier in the week had pushed several global markets, including London and Japan, into bear market territory. But the week ended on a brighter note for investors with the FTSE 100 index in London up 126 points on the day, a rise of 2.2%, to 5,900. Germany\u2019s Dax rose 2%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.1% and Spain\u2019s Ibex advanced.

The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday,\u201d Lawler added. Wall Street also got off to a good start, with the Dow Jones rising 132 points, or 0.8%, to 16,014 by the time of the London close. In Asia, the Nikkei in Tokyo rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week.

This was an occasion to reimpose the recently established order in the capital, when mere mention of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho drew from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger that all too familiar world-weary look as the talk turned to pre-match handshakes, shoving matches in the technical areas and unwelcome reminders of a dismal record against his Portuguese rival.   Related: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger tells Arsenal: expect a battle with Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa    The nouveaux riches from the King\u2019s Road would take reassurance from all the power and presence down the spine of the team and delight as opponents, whose spritely flair could so readily be throttled at source, shrivelled in inferiority. Even back in mid-September, when Chelsea already had an inkling their title defence might be flawed, a game with Arsenal had a galvanising effect and local rivals, preoccupied with the street-fighter in the home ranks, were left frazzled and, ultimately, overcome with relative ease. This was how it was. Chelsea, a side with a knack for accumulating trophies, were the nagging reminder of how the landscape in London had changed. Two defeats in 14 league meetings tells its own story. Yet, now, the suspicion is things may be shifting. Whereas Arsenal go into the weekend top of the table, their sights set firmly on a first Premier League title since the Invincibles held sway pre-Mourinho, Chelsea are only pigeon-stepping away from the relegation zone. Their dominance from the spring feels a world away. Mourinho, the icon who could shrink Arsenal with a smirk and has never lost to Wenger outside the Community Shield, has been sacked, his image removed from the team photograph outside Stamford Bridge and his name absent from the latest issue of the club magazine. He has been airbrushed from history after all that inconvenient \u201cpalpable discord\u201d. Wenger\u2019s players may never have a better opportunity to redress some of the balance than when the teams trot out at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. \u201cAre we direct rivals? Not at this moment. Not in this league,\u201d offered Guus Hiddink, this season\u2019s chosen firefighter. \u201cArsenal are making a good battle for first position. We are way down under. That\u2019s the reality.\u201d Chelsea have arguably become a case study in how not to capitalise upon a title-winning success. In years to come, championship winners will spend pre-season preaching caution and reminding the world what befell Mourinho and the team who finished eight points clear in 2015; how a manager\u2019s tenure can implode, an angry mess of unnecessarily provoked controversies and poor planning. In terms of recruitment alone, it is kind to dismiss their policy since they paraded the trophy as confused. Mourinho, perhaps unconvinced by the talent being harnessed at the Cobham academy, had wanted to build on success with eye-catching signings, but none of them came off. An opportunity was passed up. Instead they replaced like for like and, as if panicked by a stodgy start, moved to bring in Pedro and Papy Djilobodji as the deadline loomed. The former has offered only flashes of Barcelona quality, his trickery on the wing rather lost in the maelstrom into which he has been plunged. There are noises that he will return to Spain in the summer, at Valencia or Villarreal, and they do not sound outlandish. Djilobodji was recruited as a squad player but, as he wings his way to Werder Bremen on loan, it seems pertinent to linger on his Chelsea career to date: a defender who had cost \u00a32.7m having been rejected by Fulham, training as he was with Nantes\u2019 reserves, mustered one minute and one touch of the ball in a first-team shirt, and that in a Capital One Cup win at Walsall. One wonders if there wasn\u2019t a player from the academy who might have benefited more from that brush with senior football. The peculiarities of Chelsea\u2019s approach are merely brought into focus by a confrontation with Arsenal. If Mourinho had had his way, Petr Cech would never have been allowed to leave for the Emirates. Retaining a world-class goalkeeper in reserve was always going to be an uneasy and temporary scenario, of course, and Thibaut Courtois\u2019 first full season in English football had been impressive. He represented the future. Yet, when Roman Abramovich rewarded the Czech for long-standing service by sanctioning his move across the city, it was the message the transfer sent out that was truly shocking. Arsenal were direct rivals, fellow contenders for silverware, and here was their achilles heel being dipped in the Styx. Mourinho knew as much. Wenger, after some initial concerns, was quickly heartened. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what kind of shape he was in physically because he hadn\u2019t played,\u201d said the Frenchman. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how much he could still produce. But when I met him I was quickly reassured of his desire to do well and his motivation. I knew the potential was exceptional having played against him for 11 years in the Premier League. Look, it was a very, very difficult decision for me because I rate highly David Ospina, a keeper who, in my opinion, is underrated, especially in England. But [signing Cech] was maybe one of the few opportunities to say: \u2018OK, this is an obvious [transfer]. If I don\u2019t do this, it would be a mistake.\u2019\u201d   Related: Arsenal v Chelsea: match preview    Cech had been one of those key senior players in Hiddink\u2019s Chelsea team over that first spell as interim manager in 2009, and a figure whose qualities remain. No other goalkeeper boasts more than his 10 clean sheets in the Premier League this season. John Terry suggested Cech might be worth 15 points to any suitor. \u201cYou cannot measure that, but you know one thing: you need a top-class goalkeeper to do well,\u201d said Wenger. \u201cHe has a calming presence, he communicates well, anticipates well, sees what is coming. He is a kind of coach because he doesn\u2019t move, and he sees everything. He is the camera behind the team.\u201d The veteran popped into Cobham on Wednesday to retrieve his goalkeeping gloves, which Adidas had erroneously posted to his previous employer. \u201cWe had a chat, though almost everyone had gone by then,\u201d said Hiddink. \u201cIt was nice to see him. It\u2019s easy to make a judgment a year on from that decision, and when is the moment to say goodbye to a player? But you have to acknowledge Petr reacted well with his performances. He\u2019s one of those goalies who is so determined, ambitious, so detailed in his preparations. You have certain periods in a season, mostly in October and November when the leaves start falling, when the good goalies save points for your team. He is doing that.\u201d For all that Courtois\u2019 qualities are obvious, Chelsea must still gnash at the reality that Cech finds himself now in a position to emulate Eric Cantona by securing back-to-back titles with different clubs. They will travel in trepidation on Sunday, aware that their seven-match unbeaten run since Mourinho\u2019s departure has bought them only four points\u2019 breathing space from the bottom three.

It\u2019s not just any dildo \u2013 this is the latest version of Berman\u2019s inseminating device, the Semenette, now with strap-on option, new colours and renamed the POP.  Squeezing a small pump at the end of the suction tube that runs through it, she dips the dangling tip into a bottle of (on this occasion) water and draws up the liquid. With a flourish she holds it aloft, squeezes the pump and whoosh \u2013 an arc of water spurts over the table.  \u201cIt\u2019s a sex toy with a functional purpose that addresses women\u2019s health issues,\u201d explains Berman, otherwise known as \u201cSpermin\u2019 Berman\u201d, who proudly adds that she and her wife conceived their daughter, now two, on the first attempt and have a second child on the way. Berman is in Hollywood at She, the Sexual Health Expo, to promote the new device.  \u201cIt brings pleasure to something that may be stressful,\u201d says Berman of the struggle to conceive. She and her wife, a teacher, had tried the conventional \u201cturkey baster\u201d insemination method. \u201cBelieve me \u2013 there is nothing sexy in that.\u201d Organised by adult publisher XBIZ, the She convention has a relaxed, \u201ceducational\u201d atmosphere designed to make visitors feel comfortable. Local paralegal Katie Frame has come with her friend Kirsti Olson. \u201cI came thinking it would be hypersexual and porn-esque. But it\u2019s really comfortable and positive,\u201d say Frame. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about women and empowerment\u201d.

Photograph: Emily Berl for the Guardian    Talks have included Aging &amp; Sex by author Lynn Brown Rosenberg, author of My Sexual Awakening at 70 and whose upcoming engagements include a talk to Mensa members and Role Play With Koko. Sex toys have lost much of their taboo Berman is just one entrepreneur exploring more sophisticated manufacturing processes and new technologies for a sex toy market that has lost much of its taboo. Boundaries between adult products and sexual health products are blurring and, as the She event demonstrates, there\u2019s now a wide array of well-designed, high-end products made from medical or food-grade plastics and silicones. \u201cThere\u2019s a real shift, with people starting to demand high-quality products,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one wants to put toxic material into their body.\u201d She\u2019s referring to phthalates, a widely used chemical group that makes plastics flexible and has been used in sex toys.  Add to that the growth of internet-connected \u201csmart\u201d sex devices that are becoming increasingly mainstream; the award for digital health and fitness at January\u2019s influential Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas went, for the first time, to sex toy company OhMiBod. Its insertable \u201cLovelife Krush\u201d device for monitoring the effectiveness of pelvic floor exercises works via bluetooth with a smartphone app that gives visual and vibratory feedback. It promises, the company states, that stronger muscles will help prevent incontinence and deliver better orgasms. It will sell for $129 when it goes on sale in the spring. \u201cNo one in the industry ever won before \u2013 it\u2019s about as mainstream [an award] as you can get,\u201d says Michael Guilfoyle, business manager of \u201clight bedroom bondage\u201d company Sportsheets. \u201cThis used to be an industry you avoided as an entrepreneur. But now it\u2019s no longer porn-associated, there\u2018s a new generation in the business\u201d. He points to a woman in a crisp black suit working on the We-Vibe stand. \u201cThat woman speaks 10 languages.\u201d    Now that sex toys are no longer porn-associated, there's a new generation in the business  Michael Guilfoyle of 'light bedroom bondage' firm Sportsheets     Back in the She event, Berman is holding forth to a rapt audience with her scheduled talk, Sex Toys: Beyond the Orgasm. Berman projects a positive, no-nonsense vibe, demonstrating a variety of sex toys as if they were state-of-the art kitchen appliances.  The Pulse by Hot Octopus, a sort of vibrating stimulator for men, is \u201cgreat for men with erectile dysfunction or disabilities\u201d, she says, while her own POP device is \u201cdesigned for same-sex couples\u201d to replace more mundane methods of conceiving using donated sperm. Another is the Candy, a small, blush-pink ball with a loop developed by Chinese engineers for pelvic floor exercises. Berman, 34, grew up in a suburb of Boston, studied English and sociology and wanted to be a professional lyricist. But in 2001 she ended up in the business her mother started, Sepal Reproductive, a manufacturer of catheters for IVF procedures and distributor of diagnostic tests and medical devices. \u201cOur neighbors thought we ran a sperm bank\u201d, says Berman, who started as a sales rep and is now its vice-president.  Berman was developing a home insemination kit in 2009 when she came up with the idea for the Semenette, launched in 2012 by her own company Berman Innovations. The first version looked like a medical device, made of hard silicone and available in three flesh tones. For the second device launched in late 2015, Berman partnered with a high-end German sex-toy company called Fun Factory.    Related: How virtual reality porn could bring about world peace    Sarah Tomchesson is head of business operations for US adult retail store The Pleasure Chest, which sells the Semenette, but also says she conceived using the first version. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to have something to use that allows you to keep more intimacy. The orgasmic process is integral to success in getting pregnant,\u201d adds Tomchesson, who now has an eight-month-old daughter with her partner.  She thinks it will be easier for Semenette to market itself as a sex toy than as a fertility device \u2013 a highly lucrative and more competitive sector. \u201cThe exchange of sperm is regulated by the FDA at a doctor\u2019s facility and there is a lot of liability. You will run into doctors who are very resistant to talk about home insemination.\u201d Insemination is a \u2018recession-proof business\u2019 Semenette\u2019s website also explains how the POP is appealing to other communities, including female-to-male transgender customers. Berman has sold at least 500 of the new devices both to retailers and individuals mostly in the US, Canada and the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s gaining traction in the fetish and kink-play area and more men are ordering, including men with disabilities like muscular skeletal disease,\u201d she says. Berman\u2019s product also comes with a strap-on option called the \u201cJoque Harness\u201d for $119.95, and while at a recent porn industry event in Las Vegas, she spoke on a panel that included a disabled person and a plus-size speaker. \u201cThe adult industry is more aware of other audiences. You have to think outside the box and not target a cookie-cutter clientele.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a recession-proof business because everyone wants babies,\u201d says Berman. Semenette\u2019s device retails at $139.95, compared with the average $500 to $1,500 cost of one visit to a doctor\u2019s office for intrauterine insemination. And in the US, health insurance typically only kicks in after six visits, she says.  After Berman\u2019s talk, a plainly dressed Chinese business woman approaches Berman and wants a private meeting. Minnie Zhang, co-founder of new Shanghai-based sex toy company Magic Motion, thinks Berman can help them navigate the American market.  She pulls a sleek brochure out of her bag detailing elegant products such as the Magic Motion Flamingo, a \u201cwearable smart vibrator\u201d made of liquid silicone. \u201cTen years ago Chinese people didn\u2019t know about design and just copied [everything]\u201d, says Zhang. Now with a younger, more affluent and sexually open generation, Chinese companies are beginning to put their design savvy and technical skill into sex toys. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market\u201d, says Zhang, whose company has about 30 employees working on apps alone and hopes to counter the country\u2019s reputation as a maker of cheap, low-grade sex toys. \u2018It\u2019s a work of art\u2019 IMTOY co-founder Johnny Jiang, who has a degree in opto-electronics from Liverpool University, is also demonstrating the company\u2019s new men\u2019s vibrator, the Piu. A sleek black and red device slightly larger than, well, a hand, the $200 Piu is packaged like an expensive bottle of perfume. OMTOY, the company behind Pui, has a team of video producers in Japan making adult content for the Pui app. \u201cThere are 30 vibration patterns and three motors, to give a gentle butterfly flutter or a big thump,\u201d von Abo explains.     Annie Kim, an employee at the company IMTOY, shows off the Piu, an interactive masturbation toy for men. Photograph: Emily Berl for the Guardian    IMTOY also makes the Candy, a small blush-pink ball that contains a sensor and is designed for monitoring pelvic floor exercises. \u201cIt\u2019s a work of art,\u201d says Jiang, pointing to a device resting on a wireless charger, which also has an ultraviolet transmitter that sterilizes it when the case is covered; ultraviolet can kill 270 types of bacteria, the company claims. Marketing director Matthew von Abo puts a Candy in my hand and syncs it via bluetooth to the app on his iPhone. It hums and vibrates gently and when I squeeze it, the pressure sensor inside triggers a number on the app. I squeeze harder and the number rises from 100 to 225. \u201cYou can do a different workout each day,\u201d he explains. Hold for three seconds, relax for five, repeat 70 times. Meanwhile Berman is preparing to head off to a porn convention before she flies home to her family in Boston. Does she ever think about what she and her wife will tell their kids about their conception?  \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it. I will tell them that their mom invented something that [was used] in a loving, intimate way. I won\u2019t go into all the gory details.\u201d And when they\u2019re teenagers? \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead yet.\u201d", "tags": ["Gadgets", "Sexual health", "Technology", "Sex"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-23T18:07:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/24/why-is-global-economy-suffering-turbulence", "sentences": ["The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen is down 16% since the start of this year and 42% since a peak last June."], "title": "Why is the global economy suffering so much turbulence?", "article": "What is happening on global markets? The new year kicked off with a global stock market and commodities rout over worries about the global economic outlook and China\u2019s economy in particular. Plunging prices recovered at the end of last week, partly on reassurances of more stimulus to come from the European Central Bank, but traders are bracing for more volatility. At one point, oil prices fell below $28 per barrel \u2013 a 25% drop since the start of the year \u2013 on the combined effects of a supply glut and waning demand. Investors have dumped riskier stocks in favour of safe-haven assets, such as gold and government bonds. The FTSE 100 index of London-listed shares bounced back but is still down more than 5% since the start of the year. What do the experts think? Cutting its forecasts for global growth, the International Monetary Fund expressed concern about a slowdown in emerging market economies, China\u2019s difficult rebalancing away from an exports-driven economy, lower commodity prices and the ending of ultra-loose monetary policy in the US, which has just raised its interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. The IMF warned that recovery from the financial crisis could be derailed if key challenges are mishandled. The European Central Bank has also pointed to the downward pressure on eurozone growth for similar reasons. Its president, Mario Draghi, hinted the ECB was ready to print more money and cut borrowing costs, to counter those headwinds. What is China\u2019s role in this? Worries about China\u2019s true economic strength are at the heart of the jitters. After more than a decade of double-digit growth, during which it overtook Japan to become the world\u2019s second largest economy, things have inevitably slowed down. Last year China\u2019s GDP officially expanded by 6.9%, the slowest pace for 25 years; some say the true picture could well be half that. Other economic data from China has underscored the country\u2019s mammoth task of rebalancing the economy away from reliance on its vast manufacturing sector and exports to a more diverse mix.     A container ship being loaded in Qingdao, Shandong province, China. Photograph: Reuters    China\u2019s woes are being felt in other economies because it is such a big commodities consumer: the slowdown in the world\u2019s biggest energy user is weighing on oil prices. There have also been dramatic swings on China\u2019s stock markets. A debt-fuelled rush of individual investors helped inflate a bubble on China\u2019s main exchanges but it burst last summer. There have been more steep falls in recent weeks. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen is down 16% since the start of this year and 42% since a peak last June. More worrying are the moves in China\u2019s currency. Beijing stunned markets last August by devaluing the yuan, taken by some as a distress signal. A weaker yuan cheapens Chinese exports, shoring up its manufacturing sector. But the fear is that China will \u201cexport\u201d deflation because a cheaper yuan cuts the price of its imports in advanced economies. Sharp swings in the currency this month have fanned fears China could repeat last summer\u2019s move but policymakers insist they have no fresh intentions to weaken the yuan. Finally, there is scant confidence among investors in Beijing\u2019s ability to manage economic transition following a string of seemingly futile interventions in markets and confused messages from policymakers. Six interest rate cuts since November 2014 have failed to halt the economic slowdown. A mechanism to curb stock exchange volatility \u2013 a so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d \u2013 was introduced this month and then scrapped within days after it appeared to merely exacerbate the mayhem on markets. Amid worries about whether Beijing will keep its word over stabilising the yuan, IMF chief Christine Lagarde has urged China to communicate better with financial markets. But China cannot carry the blame alone, say experts. Despite rapid growth it makes up only 13% of the world economy, notes Ha-Joon Chang, who teaches economics at Cambridge University. As of 2014, the US, the eurozone and Japan together accounted for nearly half of the world economy. \u201cThe rich world vastly overshadows China,\u201d Chang says. Is this a repeat of the 2008 crisis? Speaking in Davos, billionaire speculator George Soros said: \u201cThere is a financial crisis and a bear market\u00a0\u2026 The source of the disequilibrium is different. In 2008 it was US sub-prime housing. Today it is China, where a hard landing is practically unavoidable.\u201d Others warn that the vast money-printing programmes by central banks known as quantitative easing have flooded markets with easy money and propped up asset prices while little has been done in the last seven years to address fundamental economic problems. Those analysts warn that big imbalances remain in the global economy, that the world\u2019s banking system has not been reined in and national governments have made little progress in restructuring their economies towards more diverse sources of jobs and growth.     George Soros: \u2018The cause of the disequilibrium is different.\u2019 Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images    Should investors keep calm and carry on? Yes, say other experts: the underlying economic data is not that weak and markets will soon stabilise. Emerging economies with dollar-denominated debts are certainly facing challenges as the US raises interest rates, but the outlook for the dominant developed economies looks better, they argue. Even Nouriel Roubini, the economist known as Dr Doom who predicted the last crash, told Davos: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d Fears about China are also overdone, say others, including Steve Schwarzman, billionaire boss of the private equity firm Blackstone Group. \u201cIf I thought China was in a freefall I would be really concerned. I actually don\u2019t. The consumer and the service economy is holding up pretty well in China,\u201d Schwarzman told Bloomberg Television in Davos.", "tags": ["Market turmoil", "Global economy", "Chinese economy", "Economics", "Oil", "Commodities", "Emerging markets", "Stock markets", "China", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-24T00:05:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/the-assassin-review-hou-hsiao-hsien-nie-yinniang", "sentences": ["In one bravura sequence (which recalls images from Hou\u2019s 1998 film Flowers of Shanghai), an entire scene plays out as diaphanous gauzes billow and blow before the eye of the lens, a shimmering haze of fabric and half-light."], "title": "The Assassin review \u2013 martial arts to die for", "article": "Among this year\u2019s most galling Oscar oversights is the absence of Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s The Assassin from the foreign language film nominations. Hou\u2019s first feature since 2007\u2019s Flight of the Red Balloon (a couple of compendium contributions notwithstanding), The Assassin was several years in the making, and finds the acclaimed director of Dust in the Wind, A City of Sadness and The Puppetmaster taking a groundbreaking foray into ancient history. Yet despite garnering rave reviews at the 2015 Cannes film festival where Hou was named best director, Taiwan\u2019s official submission for the 88th Oscars didn\u2019t even make the nine-title shortlist from which the nominated films were chosen. If you needed proof that awards ceremonies in general \u2013 and the Academy Awards in particular \u2013 are nonsense, then look no further. \nLoosely based on a Tang dynasty tale of a young woman raised as a killer (to which Hou and his writers have added both historical detail and imaginative backstory), The Assassin centres on Nie Yinniang (Shu Qi), taken from her home and raised by her aunt, the Princess-nun Jiaxin (Sheu Fang-yi), who teaches her to cut down quarry like \u201ca bird in flight\u201d. In a black-and-white prologue (reportedly shot on a wind-up Bolex 16mm camera) we watch the hawk-eyed Yinniang swoop, a black-clad wraith who kills in silence before vanishing into the trees like the wind that rustles the leaves. But when Yinniang\u2019s lethal edge is blunted by pangs of conscience, which prevent her from slaying a governor cradling his young child, her tutor is displeased. \u201cYou have mastered the sword but your heart lacks resolve,\u201d Jiaxin declares before setting her a mettle-testing challenge \u2013 to kill her own cousin, Tian Ji\u2019an (Chang Chen), the governor of Weibo, to whom she was once betrothed. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n  Watch a clip of The Assassin\n  \n \n \n  \n  Comparatively little of The Assassin\u2019s compact running time is taken up with action footage \n  \n \nWhat follows is a visually sumptuous tale of love and honour, politics and social ritual, interwoven with a talismanic narrative about a caged bluebird singing itself to death when presented with its own mirror image (doublings, twins and doppelgangers haunt the story, sometimes to the confusion of unversed audiences, to whom Hou makes few concessions). On one level, the film represents Hou\u2019s first foray into the wuxia genre, replete with the traditional \u201cmartial chivalry\u201d tropes of balletic fight scenes, flying wire-work, and a touch of dark magic. Yet such fantastical elements are balanced by a more down-to-earth realism that attempts to get behind the costumes and conventions. In fact, comparatively little of The Assassin\u2019s compact running time is taken up with action footage (this is a world away from, for example, Zhang Yimou\u2019s House of Flying D aggers) and the few fights we see are characterised as much by an eerie stillness as by fleet-footed choreography. \nInstead, Hou focuses on the watchful Yinniang as she surveys her prey. Like its protagonist, the film\u2019s signature style is observational \u2013 lengthy wide shots allowing us to watch characters within their environment, camera movements slow and unobtrusively elegant. Time and again the camera finds its subject by gazing through a foreground of gentle mists, dense woods or candle flames. In one bravura sequence (which recalls images from Hou\u2019s 1998 film Flowers of Shanghai), an entire scene plays out as diaphanous gauzes billow and blow before the eye of the lens, a shimmering haze of fabric and half-light. The result is magical and utterly mesmerising. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n  Guardian video review of The Assassin \n  \n \nHou has spoken of scouting locations in Inner Mongolia and Hubei province, and finding \u201csilver birch forests and lakes\u201d which were like stepping into \u201ca Chinese classical painting\u201d, with \u201cwater and mountains evoked in a single brush stroke\u201d. To my parochially British eye, the colours reminded me of Turner: green-brown moss on a thatched roof; the light-blue tinge of sun through a window; the rich burnt ochre of a smoky wood fire. Significant, too, that the film\u2019s bordered frame, which appears to inhale and exhale as the movie shifts moods, eschews widescreen vistas for more painterly portraits, emphasising the relationship between mountains and plains, land and water, man and his environment. As for the sparse soundtrack, it\u2019s a blend of birdsong and animal noise, diegetic drums and zither, with composer Lim Giong subtly blurring the lines between sound effects and score. \n\u201cThe way of the sword is pitiless,\u201d Jiaxin tells her charge, but Yinniang has such sad music in her soul that her empathy cannot be obliterated or overcome. Like its subject, Hou\u2019s breathtaking film is a beautiful mystery, matchlessly skilful, yet still hostage to human sentiments \u2013 and all the better for it.", "tags": ["The Assassin", "Film", "Culture"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-24T09:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/24/said-and-done-maurizio-sarri-chelsea-snake-sunderland", "sentences": ["He was really tired.\u201d  Move of the week China: Brazilian striker Elkeson, revealing what first attracted him to an \u20ac18m move to Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s Shanghai SIPG on a lucrative deal."], "title": "Said & Done: Maurizio Sarri; Chelsea\u2019s snake; and one big, marvellous family", "article": "Lead of the week Italy\u2019s FA - backing a two-game homophobia ban for Napoli\u2019s Maurizio Sarri over his touchline \u201cfaggot\u201d rant - two months after FA president Carlo Tavecchio was recorded saying: \u201cI\u2019ve nothing against gays, just keep them away from me.\u201d Tavecchio, banned for racism in 2014, denied prejudice: \u201cI respect everyone\u2019s choices.\u201d \u2022 Among the early verdicts on Sarri\u2019s case \u2013 Bologna director Pantaleo Corvino: \u201cThe press reaction is too extreme.

The macaques carry a genetic fault that causes a rare disorder in humans called MeCP2 duplication syndrome. This produces a wide range of medical conditions, some of which mirror those seen in autism, such as difficulties with social interactions. Researchers say groups of the GM monkeys could be used to identify brain circuits involved in common autistic behaviours and to test new treatments designed to alleviate the symptoms. Because the monkeys pass the genetic defects on to their offspring, scientists can breed large populations of the animals for medical research. A group of 200 monkeys has been established at the scientists\u2019 lab in China.   Related: Why human gene editing must not be stopped    The research, described in the journal Nature, paves the way for more varieties of GM monkeys that develop different mental and psychiatric problems which are almost impossible to study in other animals. \u201cThe first cohort of transgenic monkeys shows very similar behaviour to human autism, including increased anxiety, but most importantly, defects in social interactions,\u201d said Zilong Qiu who led the research at the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai. \u201cWe are currently carrying out brain imaging studies and trying to identify the deficiency in brain circuits that is responsible for autism-like behaviour,\u201d he added. Qiu said that if his team can work out which networks of brain cells are involved in autism symptoms, they will start investigating treatments that correct their behaviour. Tests could range from electrical stimulation directly into the brain, which some Parkinson\u2019s disease patients have administered, to magnetic stimulation through the skull, and ultimately gene therapy. The use of monkeys in medical research is controversial, but Qiu said the animals were important for studying conditions that affect the human brain. Scientists already use mice to study autism, but the rodents have such small brains, they cannot be used to look at many of the more complex problems that affect humans. Mu-ming Poo, director of the Institute of Neuroscience, said that while GM monkeys will not replace mice in research, they will overcome some of the shortcomings researchers face. Many attempts to study human brain disorders in mice fail because their brains are so different, he said. Kevin Mitchell, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin, said the modified macaques could have many advantages over mice. While mice are used because they are relatively easy to house, have large litters, and grow quickly, the animals are of limited use in trying to understand human diseases. \u201cThis is especially true for psychiatric disorders, as mice obviously do not have the rich, complex and sophisticated behaviours that humans display, and as many of the symptoms of psychiatric disorders affect high-level cognitive functions and faculties,\u201d he said. The much slower development of human brains may in itself make people more vulnerable to brain disorders. Anthony Chan, a researcher at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who created GM monkeys with Huntington\u2019s disease, said the latest study proved how advances in genetics were transforming medical research. \u201cThis particular MECP2 duplication model with progressive development of autism-like conditions will be a great resource for studying Autism Spectrum Disorders and the development of early interventions,\u201d he said. James Cusack, research director at Autistica, a charity that funds work on autism, said: \u201cDeveloping sophisticated animal models of autism has always represented a significant challenge for scientists. This excellent research has developed a more sophisticated model of autism which may further our understanding of autism, and could eventually lead to the development of more tailored treatments. \u201cIt should always be remembered that people with autism vary in a number of ways, and autism itself is linked to a number of other conditions. With this in mind, developing a single animal model of autism may be difficult to achieve.\u201d", "tags": ["Medical research", "Science", "Neuroscience", "Genetics", "Autism", "Society", "Biology"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-25T16:00:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/25/how-would-you-pull-a-big-short-in-2016", "sentences": ["Last week saw news bulletins cut live from the beaches of Lesbos and the panicked trading floors of Shanghai, to jihadi massacres in Pakistan and Burkina Faso."], "title": "How would you pull a Big Short in 2016? | Paul Mason", "article": "Last week saw news bulletins cut live from the beaches of Lesbos and the panicked trading floors of Shanghai, to jihadi massacres in Pakistan and Burkina Faso. Then, seamlessly, they would go to Davos for five minutes, to hear a calm-voiced rich person extol the virtues of the driverless car. As the world goes to hell in a handcart, the elite of policymakers and financiers remain convinced everything\u2019s going to be all right. With supreme irony, in the same week, Paramount released The Big Short. The movie is a wry take on the real-life story of investors who saw the crash of 2008 coming and made millions by betting on everybody else\u2019s folly. Based on a book by former banker Michael Lewis, it illustrates not just the ingenuity of a few mavericks, but the stupidity, complacency and amorality of the financial and policy elite. Then, too, policymakers and bankers took to the airwaves to sing the theme tune of the bursting bubble: \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be fine.\u201d   Related: The Big Short review \u2013 Ryan Gosling and Christian Bale can't save this overvalued stock    Which prompts the question, seven and a half years after Lehman Brothers fell, and with the top coming off several markets at once, how would you \u201cshort\u201d the consensus view now? The verb \u201cshort\u201d derives from short selling \u2013 selling shares you don\u2019t have in the hope that the price will fall and you can pick them up cheaper later. Generically, the term now means placing a financial bet on a downturn. Lewis\u2019s heroes shorted the mortgage finance industry by buying insurance on mortgage products everybody thought were safe. When everything blew up, it turned out the people responsible for assessing the risks had done it wrong, occasionally on purpose. Financial regulators have spent years rectifying the shoddy rules and institutions that allowed the 2008 crash to happen. Though house prices have revived, the mispriced financial products have not \u2013 at least in housing. So the Big Short of the 2010s would have to happen somewhere else. What you\u2019re looking for is a sector where hubris rules and catastrophe is being stored up. The clearest qualifier here is China. China\u2019s stock market rocketed in mid-2014 at the very moment the oil price started to collapse and the slowdown in China\u2019s growth gathered momentum. The beauty of the original Big Short was that Lewis\u2019s protagonists covered their own backs legally. To make sure they got their money back, extensive new contracts were drawn up, defining the precise triggers that would signal that Wall Street\u2019s loans had turned to ashes. That\u2019s not really possible in a one-party state, so anyone trying to short the grand Chinese illusion had to do it through the crude means of getting out faster than everyone else. Half-a-trillion-dollars worth of capital flight last year tells its own story. But maybe half a trillion is too small a scale for the next big short. Since the recovery has been driven by the policy of cheap money, co-ordinated by central banks, the logical thing to do is bet on the collapse of something that looks as if it has been made safe by the stimulus. The prime candidate is, of course, the euro. During the Greek crisis last year, prime minister Alexis Tsipras would repeatedly identify the \u20ac100bn of savings that had moved offshore since 2010 as, effectively, a bet on Grexit. The failure of that money to return so far indicates just how much trust Greeks put in the deal done last July. But, for the wider euro, there\u2019s an existential problem. The currency can\u2019t stabilise without German dominance and leadership, ultimately integrating the banking and tax systems of southern and northern Europe. But the refugee crisis has thrown everything into doubt. If Schengen collapses, and another million refugees arrive, free movement itself will come under threat of suspension. And if that happens, it would be logical for speculators to place bets on the breakup of the currency. It may seem tasteless to consider that financial speculation might hang on such real-life issues as the refugee flow through Macedonia \u2013 but the people in The Big Short were also speculating on real life. \u201cFuck you, I\u2019m short your house,\u201d one guy at Deutsche Bank says to a sceptical colleague in Lewis\u2019s book \u2013 meaning he has effectively bet on his colleague\u2019s repossession. One of the best things about The Big Short movie is that, though some of the story has been fictionalised, the corporate players are real. There\u2019s no need, as with Margin Call, to invent a Lehman lookalike. The insurance giant AIG and the investment bank Goldman Sachs play their real-life roles of hapless stooge and scheming middleman. The same institutions that were parading their restraint, largesse and deep concern for humanity in Davos last week are condemned in the movie by the designer of the \u201cshort\u201d, Mark Baum, in the following terms: \u201cWe\u2019re living in an era of fraud in America. Not just in banking. But in government, education, food, religion, journalism, prisons, baseball ... Somehow, American values became: Fuck it, let\u2019s grab what we can for now and the hell with tomorrow.\u201d So, it is safe to assume someone somewhere is, even now, profiting from the losses of Chinese investors and Greek pensioners, and that huge chunks of private money are invested in vehicles designed to profit from increased mayhem. In the time it took Lewis to research the book and Hollywood to turn it into a movie, an entire financial cycle has happened. Risible though the illusions of the subprime boom were, they were shared by millions of people. I am not convinced our own convictions about the stability of the global order are any more deeply rooted in reality. \u2022 Paul Mason is economics editor of Channel 4 News. @paulmasonnews", "tags": ["Money", "Economic policy", "Financial sector", "Business", "The Big Short", "Investments"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-25T16:55:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/26/10-signs-youre-at-a-burns-night-supper", "sentences": ["There was even a kilt spottd in Shanghai, albeit alongside a giant mechanical horse."], "title": "10 signs you're at a Burns Night supper", "article": "There might be a few sore heads this morning, as Scottish people and Scotland enthusiasts recover from celebrating Burns Night, a tribute to the noted poet and a good excuse to get together for food, drinks and good times.

In a message that will cheer motorists and countries that import oil, it added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 (\u00a326) a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October.

In recent weeks the price of Brent crude has sunk below $30 a barrel and supermarket petrol prices have dipped below \u00a31 a litre. John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the World Bank\u2019s commodities markets outlook, said: \u201cLow prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time. While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain.\u201d Brent crude rose almost 5% to touch $32 a barrel, reversing earlier falls after both Opec and non-Opec producers responded by saying they would adopt further measures to tackle oversupply. The FTSE 100 in London ended 0.6% higher at 5,911 points, while Frankfurt and Paris both added about 1%, shrugging off a 6.4% fall in Shanghai that took the leading Chinese stock market to its lowest close since December 2014. New York continued the recovery to register an early 298-point gain by 5.30pm GMT. The World Bank\u2019s intervention follows a forecast by the International Energy Agency that contributed to panic selling last week and a collapse in the price of Brent crude to $27 a barrel. The report said prices could fall further as new Iranian output cancels out production cuts elsewhere, leading to third successive year when supply exceeded demand by 1m barrels a day. Officials at the bank played down the likelihood of a crash, though they warned in a separate report that a synchronised slowdown in the biggest emerging markets could be intensified by a fresh bout of financial turmoil, tipping the world economy into recession. Oil prices began to tumble during the summer of 2014 in response to a slowdown in China\u2019s factory output. The country\u2019s manufacturing industry, which in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash has become the world\u2019s largest single destination for oil and metals, stopped buying commodities at the previous high levels. Investors expected the major oil producers to cut production in response to falling demand, but instead the Saudi-led Opec nations, Russia, and the US oil fracking firms have until recently maintained the flow of crude into world markets. The World Bank, which is a major lender to developing nations, said the market had reached a turning point and the \u201cfundamental drivers of oil demand and supply\u201d are \u201clikely to partly reverse\u201d.  It argued that prices would stabilise below $40 for the rest of the year as high-cost oil producers make production cuts \u201cthat are likely to outweigh any additional capacity coming to the market\u201d. A modest pickup in global growth would also prevent a further slump. Beyond oil markets, the prices for commodities are expected to be weighed down by a plentiful supply of food and metals amid slowing demand in emerging market economies. In all, prices for 37 of the 46 commodities monitored by the World Bank were revised lower for the year. \u201cEmerging market economies have been the main sources of commodity demand growth since 2000.

Global population may never scale the vertiginous peaks foreseen in the panicky neo-Malthusian literature of the mid-20th century, chiefly Paul and Anne Ehrlich\u2019s famous jeremiad of 1968, The Population Bomb. Nor will overpopulation\u2019s effects, as they fold back against the cities of the global north, much resemble the apocalyptic depictions in the era\u2019s pop culture; 1973\u2019s Soylent Green, for example, opens with a title card informing the viewer that 40 million souls reside in the smog-choked New York City of 2022, and that seems more than a little hard to imagine now. But neither is it a state of affairs one can dismiss casually. Every last one of those 10 billion human beings is going to need a place to live. And wherever that place should happen to be, it won\u2019t be in the cities we\u2019re presently familiar with. However trendy \u201curban infill\u201d and densification may be in our faculties of architecture, polities in the developed world are no longer willing to countenance the kind of conditions that inevitably result when hundreds of thousands of human bodies are packed into every square mile. The residential housing densities of New York\u2019s Lower East Side circa 1905, for example, among the highest ever recorded, were achieved by housing two or three families in each (smallish) room. This is precisely the kind of overcrowding the entire Modernist movement in architecture was set up to design out of urban settlement. Further, barring the deployment of truly draconian powers of expropriation, central-zone land values in existing cities are in any event orders of magnitude too expensive to permit wholesale redevelopment at anything like the scale required. Entirely new cities will be necessary \u2013 very likely, thousands of them.     The notorious Chinese predilection for ghost cities is being replicated on African terrain    It shouldn\u2019t surprise us that the planet\u2019s newest cities are to be found in the places where its population is most rapidly urbanising: India, China and sub-Saharan Africa. Whether acquired by eminent domain, compulsory purchase order or outright expropriation, assembling meaningfully sized parcels of land in existing urban cores can be a messy, expensive and time-consuming process. The favoured strategy in all of these places is therefore to develop entirely new satellite cities on peripheral sites where land is cheap \u2013 or barring that, to build upon land reclaimed from the ocean. Vanessa Watson, an urban planning expert at the University of Cape Town, has written extensively about this dynamic as it plays out in Africa. In Watson\u2019s telling, a long litany of private-sector new city initiatives now spangles the African continent, from the planned Nairobi developments of Konza Techno City and Tatu City, to Ghana\u2019s Appolonia and Hope City, to the Eko Atlantic project in Lagos (\u201cthe best prime real estate in West Africa\u201d). Each represents an effort to gussy up the raw economics of land development with the comforting, familiar tropes of the knowledge economy. Each is dashed with the most superficial gloss of technological contemporaneity, right down to the inevitable \u201cSilicon\u201d prefix. And each is more placeless than the last, predicated on a generic model of development that could not possibly have less to do with the actual political, economic or material conditions obtaining in any African society.     The planned business district of Konza Techno City in Kenya    This strikingly inapposite quality among the new African cities can be traced to a few factors. On the one hand, the bland look of nonplace is perceived by local elites to be the sign and sigil of successful modernity. But it is also true that none of the parties doing the actual design work are local to the continent, or, evidently, particularly conversant with any of its cultures. Though certain western names \u2013 Deloitte, McKinsey, HR&amp;A Advisors \u2013 crop up repeatedly, it\u2019s clear that at present infrastructure development in sub-Saharan Africa has a markedly Chinese character. Even the notorious Chinese predilection for ghost cities is being replicated on African terrain, most evidently at Nova Cidade de Kilamba in Angola, where a city for 500,000 constructed by the Chinese state-owned developer CITIC stands mostly empty on the Luandan plain. Chlo\u00e9 Buire reports that as of last September, after the passage of legislation mandating steep price cuts to the smallest available units, Kilamba could now claim some 80,000 residents. Even where they are fully inhabited, though, the new wave of African cities seem designed not so much to house existing local populations as to purge them in favour of a more remuneratively elite clientele. In Watson\u2019s words, the schemes she studied \u201cassume that the largely informal urban population will be wished away\u201d. (There is some support for this assertion in the published renderings for Eko Atlantic, striking primarily for their depiction of a markedly light-skinned population cohort that in no way resembles a representative sample of present-day Lagos.) The palpable fear of informality is a troubling sign: if history is any lesson, any success at all on the part of these development sites will be despite and not because of their static plans; like Bras\u00edlia before them, they may eventually come to life when the voids in the formal city have been occupied by all of the people left undepicted in the expensive renderings, and whatever informal housing and services they develop to serve their own needs. The emerging African pattern of private-sector new-city development is mirrored by the \u201centrepreneurial urbanism\u201d that University of Leeds researcher Ayona Datta identifies in contemporary India, under Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party. Here, too, we see the strategy of distributing population to a scatter of brand-new satellite cities, erected on low-value land; here too the design undertaken by an all but exclusively foreign expert class (though not, in this case, Chinese).     A poster advertising one of India\u2019s new smart cities, the Gujarat International Finance Tec City. Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP    The BJP scheme to develop no fewer than 100 new \u201csmart cities\u201d \u2013 and here that label feels even more than usually empty \u2013 would be unworkable without recourse to the mostly invisible global infrastructure of planning and engineering firms. As a result, where published plans exist, they are as generic and as poorly suited to the realities of Indian life as their equivalents to the southwest are to African realities. Datta\u2019s grim account of the Dholera smart-city project echoes Watson: it\u2019s a tale of farmers and fishers displaced from their land, supplanted by gated communities and air-conditioned golf clubs for the globalised elite. Some new Chinese cities, at least, have a different flavour. Here the preferred model of development isn\u2019t some smoothly generic global nonplace, but the idealised European past. Shanghai\u2019s \u201cOne City, Nine Towns\u201d policy dropped detailed copies of Scandinavian, German, Dutch, Italian and Tudor villages on to a ring of sites orbiting central Shanghai; as has been widely reported, most remain empty, used perhaps as backdrops for wedding pictures. Not even the evident lack of demand for such housing can slow the pace of construction. Given newly available construction technology, China\u2019s world-historical rush of citymaking appears if anything to be accelerating. Just as the high Soviet technology of tilt-up concrete slabs permitted thousands of new towns to be thrown up in short order, across the Eastern Bloc, the emergence of building-scale 3D printing allows high-rises to sprout overnight. A Shanghai-based company called Winsun Decoration Design Engineering has for the last few years demonstrated feats of near-instant fabrication with its massive printer, and if the results won\u2019t be winning the Pritzker Prize any year soon, they at least appear to respond to local tastes and preferences.     Construction taking place in the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city, China. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Sometimes, when Chinese cities appear overnight, it\u2019s not via cutting-edge technology, but rather because they\u2019ve been created by fiat. This is the case of the new Chinese supercapital Jing-Jin-Ji. Completely subsuming the cities formerly known as Beijing and Tianjin, as well as their Hebei Province hinterlands, Jing-Jin-Ji imagines an urbanised condition being smeared between these previously discrete settlements until they fuse into one mind-boggling hypercity. At least, this is how it all plays out in the mind of state planners, and the real-estate brokers already salivating over the catchment area\u2019s skyrocketing land values.  Though it has little to do with cities as most of us understand them, or even with anything foreseen by the original theorists of megalopolis, Jing-Jin-Ji is clearly something new upon the earth. Perhaps it can help us broaden our conception of what a city is and can be, what forms urban habitation can take. By any rational accounting, we\u2019d be numbering refugee camps like the sprawling complex at Dadaab, Kenya, among the planet\u2019s newest cities. Home to well over 300,000 human beings as of last October \u2013 and half a million, as recently as the end of 2011 \u2013 Dadaab is a grid of tents in the desert, housing a population roughly the size of Helsinki, Memphis, Bristol or Wellington.     Dadaab refugee camp has a population roughly the size of Helsinki, Bristol or Wellington. Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images    If it qualifies as a city by that of population or any other reasonable metric, why then do we tend to neglect Dadaab and the all too many places like it when we discuss emergent practices of urbanism? Both the American architect Charlie Hailey and the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, after all, identify the camp as the signature form that urbanism takes in our century. For Agamben, camp space is what results when a wartime state of emergency becomes the permanent condition of everyday life, and that feels like an acute diagnosis of the real lives far too many people lead, much more relevant to the actual circumstances of our collective existence than any number of glossy renderings. Under UNHCR policy, however, sites like Dadaab cannot be defined as permanent settlements, lest their residents lose eligibility for aid. The planet\u2019s refugee and resettlement camps are destined to remain cities in everything but name.   Related: Where is the fastest growing city in the world?    But for these camps, most of the planet\u2019s newest cities bear a markedly strong resemblance to one another. Whether they happen to be planted on African terrain or Indian or Chinese, they have the self-contained, inward-turning flavour of a high-end condo, and indeed are branded and marketed in just the same way. Though in virtually every case, the developers in question have taken great pains to describe their sensitivity to local traditions, both social and architectural, their developments have a numbing similarity, right down to the central business districts, marinas and grand axial boulevards. Indeed, at a first glance, the Tianjin Eco-city plan is impossible to distinguish from those for Dholera, Eko Atlantic or the cloyingly named GREAT City Chengdu. These new cities \u2013 or more precisely, new conurbations \u2013 demonstrate how complexes of land can become comprehensively urbanised without ever really acquiring the character of a city. They may, with a few decades\u2019 in-dwelling, habit and custom, someday feel like real urban places, but for many years to come they will almost certainly remain as harrowingly sterile as any new master-planned development, western exemplars like Canary Wharf or Mission Bay not excluded. And for the moment, anyway, far too many of them stand all but empty, despite the millions close at hand clamouring for a decent home. There we have the new cities of the twenty-first century: buildings without people, people without buildings. Even if the injustice of the situation doesn\u2019t abrade your soul, perhaps the sheer irrational waste of it will.

Nor is he fond of sounding off about the influence of manioc on Burundian cuisine. And yet, if ever you need to discuss these topics with someone, then the Everton manager may be your man. Because there seems to be nothing Mart\u00ednez likes more than talking about things he doesn\u2019t like talking about. That has been the one constant throughout his managerial career. That, and defensive collapses.

It\u2019s disappointing that call did not go our way. Anyway, I shouldn\u2019t talk about referees this season. I\u2019ve learnt my lesson.\u201d 28 December 2015, after Mart\u00ednez\u2019s Everton lose 4-3 to Stoke City: \u201cI have huge respect for [referee] Mark [Clattenburg\u2019s]\u2019s career \u2013 he has always been someone I felt was very honest and a perfectionist in what he wants to do. The feeling is extra frustrating today because you cannot understand how such an experienced referee gives that decision right at the end. It is such a wrong call. Someone with his experience should understand the game a bit more \u2026 The disappointment is that he got that one wrong but it is extra painful when he wasn\u2019t consistent throughout the game.\u201d In light of all that, was there really any point in interviewing Mart\u00ednez after Everton were knocked out of the League Cup on Wednesday night by Manchester City, whose second goal in a 3-1 win came from a cross that Raheem Sterling was allowed to deliver despite the ball having crossed the line for a nanosecond by the width of a sideburn hair? \u201cYou have to respect the referee, they have the toughest job in football,\u201d declared Martinez before adding inevitably: \u201cIt is not a day to go into many footballing aspects except the second goal killed our opportunity \u2026 Goals are big calls \u2013 and the second goal is heartbreaking. When you watch the replay it\u2019s incredible that you don\u2019t get that decision right.\u201d Ah yes, when you watch the replay. Unless there is a sudden transformation in Everton\u2019s performances between now and the end of the season, Mart\u00ednez may find himself having to explain how a collection of players that he has hailed as among the most exciting in Europe have have once again finished potless, and in the bottom half of the Premier League two years in a row.

Unlike Alan Pardew, he has finally convinced Mike Ashley that a heavily Francophone squad requires reinforcement with British players.   Related: Andros Townsend joins Newcastle for \u00a312m from Tottenham Hotspur    This month\u2019s \u00a312m arrival of Jonjo Shelvey from Swansea City and Andros Townsend from Tottenham Hotspur for the same sum are proof of a hard-won victory but now the manager needs to win the wider war. If Newcastle are to harbour realistic hopes of avoiding relegation, McClaren must ensure the owner sanctions the purchase of a stellar striker and, ideally, a defender or two before the transfer window closes on Monday. Should a goalscorer fail to arrive Newcastle will resemble an ostensibly attractive family home that, behind an enviable facade, fails to function properly because of a lack of basic kitchen and bathroom facilities. Ashley is said to have intervened personally in the Townsend deal, abandoning his supposed hands-off position and giving Lee Charnley, the club\u2019s managing director, a bit of help by negotiating with Daniel Levy, Tottenham\u2019s chairman, directly. With the impasse broken and a \u00a312m \u201ccompromise\u201d fee agreed, the winger was soon Tyneside-bound but, if a prolific striker is shortly to be connecting with his crosses, Ashley may need to get involved once more. Just as it would have been fascinating to have been a fly on the wall during negotiations involving the sports retail tycoon and Levy, Newcastle\u2019s owner v Jeremy Peace, West Bromwich Albion\u2019s chairman, would surely be equally intriguing.     Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, left, scoring here for Chelsea against Leicester, did quite well in a previous spell at Newcastle, on loan in 2013-14. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images    McClaren wants to sign Saido Berahino but with West Brom holding out for \u00a330m there is a \u00a310m gap in their valuations. Chelsea\u2019s Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, who did quite well during a short stint at Newcastle under Pardew, appears the back-up option. He would almost certainly arrive on loan and, like Shelvey and Townsend, would need no time to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League. That said, Townsend has not played a full game in the top tier for almost two years. Time is a key issue here. Newcastle are running out of it and, despite some decent approach play, have won only one of their past seven league games. Without a finisher, the \u00a340m plus spent last summer and the near \u00a330m invested during this window \u2013 when the midfielder Henri Saivet has also arrived from Bordeaux \u2013 will probably not be sufficient to insulate them from the financially calamitous effects of dropping into the Championship. With Aleksandar Mitrovic unable to outpace defenders and less than clinical in front of goal, and Papiss Ciss\u00e9 injured, the creative work supplied by Gini Wijnaldum, Moussa Sissoko and Ayoze P\u00e9rez is largely going to waste. Whereas Bournemouth, a relegation rival, moved fast to invest around \u00a317m in the strikers Benik Afobe and Lewis Grabban this month, Newcastle have played a longer game. The only problem is this has limited their potential for collecting Premier League points. In the three games Afobe has played for Eddie Howe\u2019s side he has scored two goals. McClaren was extremely keen on Charlie Austin but his board was apparently worried about one of the forward\u2019s knees \u2013 Austin has strongly denied he is hampered by a knee problem \u2013 and Southampton proved more appealing. Austin, of course, scored on his debut against Manchester United last weekend. Newcastle\u2019s manager, defeated at Watford, would not have relished that news snippet from Old Trafford. A few days ago a long-mooted move for Lyon\u2019s France forward Alexandre Lacazette remained a vague possibility but that seems to have collapsed. In truth, it always looked a little ambitious and, as the games have come and gone and no striker has arrived, it seems Ashley is taking one of his beloved high-stakes gambles on being able to force through a last-minute deal. There is also a sense he would like to recoup some money before spending again. Cheik Tiot\u00e9 has turned down a move to Shanghai and is talking to other suitors from China; McClaren could do with him saying yes to one of them. Florian Thauvin, who could be heading back to the Stade V\u00e9lodrome on loan, has been a \u00a313m flop on the wing since his summer move from Marseille and Ashley will not be thrilled to face the prospect of writing off that chunk of cash. By way of compensation he had hoped fringe players such as Yoan Gouffran may be departing but, so far, there seems no stampede for the exits. If acquiring a goalscorer remains imperative, this penchant for buying wingers fails to camouflage the squad\u2019s structural imbalance. Part of the reason Newcastle lost at Watford was that McClaren was forced to field a new system, a back five, featuring the winger Rolando Aarons at left wing-back. With Paul Dummett, Massadio Ha\u00efdara and Jack Colback injured there was no one available to play at left-back. Although Dummett usually fills that role he is really a centre-half, and Colback is a midfielder. In hindsight selling Davide Santon to Internazionale this time last year was not really that smart a move. With a lack of cover for Daryl Janmaat at right-back and the central defensive deputies for Fabricio Coloccini and Chancel Mbemba not entirely convincing \u2013 although the newly fit Steven Taylor has the potential to do well if he can steer clear of further injuries \u2013 there is a strong case for strengthening the backline too. It was only a behind-closed-doors friendly but Newcastle\u2019s 6-0 defeat at Sunderland on Wednesday afternoon in a controversial practice match hardly screamed defensive stability. McClaren, a pragmatist, would probably be content to make do and mend with that rearguard so long as he can shake R\u00e9my\u2019s (or, in his happiest dreams, Berahino\u2019s) hand by Monday evening. But will he get his man?     The use of the winger Rolando Aarons at left wing-back against Watford last weekend was another example of the imbalanced squad at Newcastle.

So a drive to push down the value of the yen, making it easier to export, can be expected to raise a cheer in the sake bars of Kyoto. And that\u2019s just what the Bank of Japan did when it imposed a 0.1% charge on deposits. It\u2019s not the official policy objective \u2013 fighting inflation is. Conversely, the central bank emphasises the negative impact on saving and therefore the incentive for corporates to spend their large cash piles. But the key to understanding the latest move is the need to maintain an already depressed currency. This is because big business in Japan will not invest in extra production without the assurance that the yen will be low for at least the rest of the business cycle, which they hope could be another five years. Japan is an export junkie that needs the rest of the world to buy much more of the stuff it makes at home than they will ever buy from abroad. The deposit charge works by acting as a disincentive for international investors to park their money in Tokyo. With fewer funds coming into the country, the demand for yen falls and so does the value of the currency, especially in relation to the all-important dollar. It was important for the Bank of Japan to shift up a gear for four reasons. The first relates to the China crisis and the fall in the value of the yuan. Japan is increasingly finding that China is a direct competitor in the East Asia region for contracts and major orders. It recently suffered a morale-sapping shock when it lost a high-speed rail contract in Indonesia won by the newly created Chinese national railway company. The dumping of Chinese steel and other manufactured products has acted as another incentive. It depresses prices again when inflation was only just recovering. The Bank of Japan, like all the major central banks, has a target of 2% stable inflation. Officials forecast last year that prices would rise by 1.4% in 2016. The latest forecast has been cut to 0.8%. Thirdly, the turmoil in world markets in response to the China slowdown has again turned Japan into a safe haven for international funds. Since last September, when Beijing hit trouble and the Shanghai stock market panicked, cash has poured into Tokyo. The yen, already under pressure, started to climb. The final straw was the threat from Mario Draghi, the boss of the European Central Bank, that he will cut his deposit rate again in March after already starting down that road last year.  Tokyo is pumping almost \u00a350bn a month into the Japanese economy by buying government bonds under a quantitative easing programme. Draghi is doing the same. With this in mind, it was clear that without a decisive move to maintain parity, a further rise in the yen was inevitable. And it\u2019s had the desired effect. From 117 yen to the dollar a week ago, traders must now spend 120 yen to buy a dollar.  In some ways, it was a wonder the 5/4 vote in favour of a negative deposit rate was so close. Prime minister Shinzo Abe lost his economy minister on Thursday to a bribery scandal. But that setback cannot be allowed to undermine his compact with big business \u2013 if he keeps the yen low, they agree to boost investment, exports and employment. As they all know, only then can Japan\u2019s inflation have a hope of reaching the target.

However, weak economic growth figures in the US underscored the scale of a global slowdown that has rattled investors. Policymakers at Japan\u2019s central bank stunned markets with a narrow vote to impose a 0.1% fee on deposits left with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) \u2013 in effect a negative interest rate. The central bank was spurred into action as volatile markets, flagging global growth and a downturn in China threatened major economies around the world. In the US, news that the economy barely grew in the final three months of 2015 prompted speculation that its central bank would rein in plans to raise interest rates this year, having tightened borrowing costs for the first time in almost a decade in December. GDP rose at an anaemic annual rate of 0.7% as consumers and businesses cut back on spending, while US exports were hurt by weaker overseas markets. Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial Markets, said: \u201cAll in all, these GDP data support the sense given by recent monthly numbers that the US economy lost momentum into the end of 2015. We are struggling to see how this story is reversed in the coming quarters.\u201d Stock market investors were cheered by the prospect of US interest rates rising at a slower pace and by the Japanese move, which followed the similarly aggressive precedent set by the European Central Bank (ECB) in June 2014. The negative rate is designed to encourage commercial banks to use excess reserves \u2013 which they normally keep with the central bank \u2013 to lend to businesses instead. The radical intervention provided an immediate boost to stock markets around the world after a dramatic start to the year that saw trillions of dollars wiped off their value in a matter of days. On Friday, the FTSE 100 in London closed up 2.6% at 6,084, to be back within a whisker of its starting level for 2016 of 6,242. That rise was mirrored around European bourses and followed a rally in Asian stock markets, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 2.8% to a two-week high. At the time of the London close, Wall Street was also higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.7%. Chinese shares also rallied following the Japanese rate move but still suffered their biggest monthly fall for seven years. The Shanghai Composite Index has lost 22.6% since the start of the year. The surprise negative rates decision came just days after the BoJ\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, suggested he had dismissed any drastic easing measures to boost business confidence. On Friday, the bank said it had not ruled out a further cut. \u201cThe BoJ will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary,\u201d it said in a statement. It said the move was intended to lessen the risk to Japanese business confidence from turbulence in the global economy, a week after data showed the Chinese economy had grown at its slowest pace for a quarter of a century in 2015. The ECB held back from injecting more electronic cash into markets at its meeting this month but it too fired up share prices with a promise to consider more action in March. The prospect of central banks pumping more stimulus into a struggling global economy has also helped stabilise oil prices. Brent crude, which earlier in January hit a 13-year low below $28 a barrel, stood at about $33.86 on Friday. It is still down 30% from a year ago. Highlighting global unease about the global outlook following China\u2019s slowdown, gold prices have gained almost 5% in January. Friday\u2019s estimate of US GDP from the Commerce Department was less than half the 2% annual growth rate in the third quarter and was the weakest showing since a severe winter reduced growth to a 0.6% annual rate in the first quarter of 2015. Economists cautioned that this early estimate could yet be revised but said it still pointed to global headwinds buffeting the world\u2019s biggest economy and suggested the US Federal Reserve would not go ahead with all four interest rate rises slated for this year. Some said the latest signs of a US slowdown left the US central bank looking unwise after December\u2019s rate rise. \u201cThe GDP growth slowdown sheds a rather critical light on the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates in December,\u201d said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cFor the sake of credibility, it is unlikely that the Fed will reverse its December decision, but rates are likely to stay at their current level until 2017.\u201d", "tags": ["Market turmoil", "Global economy", "Economics", "Stock markets", "Business", "US economy", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Federal Reserve", "Oil", "Commodities", "European Central Bank", "Interest rates", "China", "Europe", "European monetary union"], "publicationDate": "2016-01-29T20:24:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/30/apple-xiaomi-vivo-oppo-challengers-leading-charge-china", "sentences": ["The FT\u2019s Jonathan Margolis recalled last week how \u201cwhen I used a nice Android [phone] in the company of a friend in Shanghai, she advised me that I looked \u2018like a poor man from the country\u2019.\u201d For urban dwellers, having an iPhone, or a phone easily mistaken for an iPhone, is still a status symbol."], "title": "Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo: the challengers leading China\u2019s charge against Apple", "article": "The idea that one of America\u2019s most talismanic businesses \u2013 and the world\u2019s biggest company by market value \u2013 might one day come to rely on China for its growth would have seemed strange just a decade ago.

There again, on previous occasions Cook has been equally confident about the long-term future of the iPad \u2013 and its sales have now fallen for eight quarters in row. Now Apple faces three key challenges in the Chinese market, the world\u2019s largest for smartphones: the economic headwinds and falling share prices cutting into consumer spending and confidence; the saturated market; and the intensifying competition from far cheaper homegrown rivals. China\u2019s phone market, which accounted for a third of all smartphone sales worldwide in 2015, is already slowing as the number of first-time phone buyers declines and people delay replacement purchases. A year ago, phones were being replaced on average after just 13 months; now that period is lengthening. According to Woody Oh, an analyst at research group Strategy Analytics, total Chinese smartphone sales in October-December actually fell by 4%, to 118m; Apple sold 15.5m phones there, up from 13.5m a year before, while its worldwide sales remained flat at 74.4m. But that was only enough to make Apple the third-biggest supplier behind local firms Huawei (pronounced \u201cHoo-wah-way\u201d) and Xiaomi (\u201cshe-yow-mee\u201d), which each sold nearly 18m units. And just behind Apple were two more local rivals, Vivo and Oppo. All of the rivals offer much cheaper products, running Android software (without Google\u2019s services inside China; with them outside) and they have seen scorching growth in 2015. Huawei principally builds telecoms network equipment, but has been solidly expanding its handset business. Almost half of the 108m it turned out in 2015 were exported. Xiaomi had aimed for 100m in total, but slow first-half sales cut that to 70m for the year, of which 90% were sold in China. Oppo, meanwhile, has grown by 67% in the year, shifting 50m units worldwide.     Shops advertising the iPhone 6S in Shenzhen. Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters    The absence of Samsung, the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone maker, from China\u2019s top five may seem surprising. But it has been hurt more than Apple by low-cost rivals in the past two years; Xiaomi pushed it from the top spot in 2014, and the local competition has eaten away at its sales. Now, though, those rivals are trying to take a bigger bite out of Apple. But they are coming up against the power of its brand \u2013 which, so far, remains highly aspirational in China. Unlike phone makers using Google\u2019s Android, Apple \u2013 which writes its own iOS software \u2013 remains able to command premium pricing, and more. The dollar\u2019s strength means that in China an entry-level iPhone 6S that in the US costs $649 is priced at the equivalent of $833. And this in a country where the mean income is 56,339 yuan \u2013 about \u00a36,000 or $8,500. The cheapest iPhone thus costs more than a month\u2019s wages; in the west, that used to be the measure of how much to spend on a diamond engagement ring. Yet it is a price people have been willing to pay, specifically because it is expensive. The FT\u2019s Jonathan Margolis recalled last week how \u201cwhen I used a nice Android [phone] in the company of a friend in Shanghai, she advised me that I looked \u2018like a poor man from the country\u2019.\u201d For urban dwellers, having an iPhone, or a phone easily mistaken for an iPhone, is still a status symbol. In addition, Apple has better distribution than smaller rivals through deals with China Mobile, the world\u2019s largest telecoms player, and the two other networks. \u201cApple has worked hard to extend its retailer coverage across China, while Apple Music and other localised services have refreshed the iOS ecosystem for Chinese consumers,\u201d notes Oh. Neil Shah at Counterpoint Research, another analysis firm, says that Xiaomi has had great success attracting first-time customers in the under-$150 segment, where it competes with local rivals such as Lenovo. But at the upgrade stage it loses customers, who shift to Huawei, Oppo \u2013 and Apple. \u201cAlmost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone,\u201d Cook told analysts \u2013 suggesting about 7m successes in getting people to lay out money. However that willingness to buy Apple\u2019s product will be sorely tested this year as China\u2019s economy struggles. Cook\u2019s revenue guidance already implies a fall in sales against the year before. Having pushed Samsung aside, local rivals will be looking to complete a clean sweep of the bestselling phones this time next year.

Best known for its founder\u2019s links to the Red Army \u2013 which has meant its network gear has been banned from the US over spying suspicions. In the UK, however, BT uses Huawei equipment extensively. ZTE Like Huawei, a Chinese company that also makes network equipment, but for which handsets are increasingly important: it grew 36% in 2015, to more than 60m handsets, aiming for the low-end market. But it doesn\u2019t publish financial data, so profit or loss is unknown. Lava Indigenous to India, Lava is one of the fastest-growing companies in the newest fast-growth market, now that China has slowed to a crawl. Like all its rivals, it uses Google\u2019s Android, but unusually has Intel chips powering the phones. This year it aims to expand into Mexico. Oppo The Chinese smartphone brand shipped 50m handsets in 2015, up 67%, to rank among the world\u2019s top 10. It competes with Xiaomi on price, but has had more success abroad in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia. FALLING STARS HTC The Taiwanese company made the first Android phone, and was once the US\u2019s largest Android supplier. But it shrank 17% in 2015 and has made losses for three quarters in a row. With no services business, it is being crushed by the competition. Lenovo/Motorola Lenovo is the world\u2019s biggest PC maker, and bought American mobile-phone pioneer Motorola in 2014, but has been unable to bring it to profit. It is also losing out in the fiercely competitive Chinese market to Huawei and Xiaomi, seeing sales fall and losses mount. Microsoft/Nokia Microsoft bought the rump of Nokia\u2019s phone business in September 2013, but has seen sales droop and been unable to find profitability. Sales shrank nearly 30% in 2015, according to Counterpoint. Sony Though it makes camera sensors for everyone including Apple and Samsung, Sony\u2019s phone business has lost more than $1bn in the past two years, and sales peaked in 2014. Management has wondered about a sale, even while scaling down to cut losses.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a380-\u00a3110 I believe I have found the single best dessert available right now in London, or, for that matter, anywhere else. It\u2019s a wonder of patisserie that manages to combine the luscious with both precision and finesse. If I was told I could eat one last sweet thing before swearing off them for life, I would choose this, and then sit mourning the end of all that is lovely and true. Of course you want details but dessert comes at the end of the meal, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the description. I had to wait for it and so should you. I went to A Wong out of low-level guilt, an emotion I strive to avoid. After all, if I start feeling guilty, where do I stop? Nevertheless, I was a little sad about last week\u2019s review: not so much about my assessment of Shuang Shuang \u2013 it really was exhausting \u2013 but that this should have been the last Chinese I reviewed before we celebrate the arrival of the New Year on 8 February. The year of the monkey deserves better, not least because Britain\u2019s Chinese restaurants are in a good place right now. The over-sweetened knock-offs of Cantonese food, in sauces so orange as to make David Dickinson jealous, are in retreat. A Wong is part of the good stuff. It opened in 2013 when Andrew Wong decided his LSE degree in anthropology was the perfect grounding with which to take over a generic Chinese in Victoria previously run by his father. That location, away from Chinatown, may explain the sense of liberation at play here. Regionalism, an understanding of China\u2019s many culinary traditions, may be making headway in the UK, but Wong has a certain restlessness. He toured China, exploring its many cooking styles, before coming back to get to work. We are the beneficiaries of his travels.     \u2018It could be a prop in a horror sci-fi movie about alien spawn, just waiting to hatch\u2019: tea egg with shredded filo. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    I go at lunchtime, when the dim sum menu is the main show. It\u2019s priced per single piece from \u00a31.30 to \u00a33 for the more complex items. Some of it sounds familiar, but there\u2019s myriad diverting twists. The prawn cracker is identifiably so, but is a single large piece, the size of a plate, and used as a platform for a tangle of finely knotted deep-fried seaweed (or whichever brassica they\u2019re using), a dollop of their own sweet chilli sauce, some pickled daikon, a smear of satay and a few other things besides. A pork and prawn dumpling, as pert as an augmented breast but much more alluring, is topped by a curl of freshly fried pork crackling; a clear dumpling of shrimp wears a bonnet of a citrus foam, and while we are meant to point and laugh at such things, here it gives a bright acidic burst at just the right moment. Then along comes a dish which impresses on simple craftsmanship. Shanghai soupy dumplings are clever, the filling of pork made with a stock which is jellied when cold but which, when heated, turns them into pouches of hot broth around the filling. Too often they stick to the greaseproof paper so that, as you lift them away, the shell tears, losing the prized soup. These hold together perfectly and deliver up a broth infused with handfuls of fresh ginger. It\u2019s one of those items that makes you feel like a better person simply for having the smarts to eat it.     \u2018Some dumplings are presented on small squares of AstroTurf, which is a little odd\u2019: mushroom buns. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    As does Chengdu street tofu, more of a hot set, savoury custard under a dressing of soy chilli, peanuts and preserved vegetable. Some dumplings are presented on small squares of AstroTurf, which is a little odd. Scallop puff three ways looks like a deep-fried sea anemone. It is a tangle of wispy, red, crisp tentacles and though I\u2019m hard pushed to discern the three different ways or, for that matter, the scallop, it\u2019s a pleasant textural experience. A mushroom, pork and truffle dumpling is a bun of earthiness and forest depths and winter darkness. Then along comes a generous bowl of salt-and-pepper green beans, in a batter so lacy and transparent it could be on special offer at Agent Provocateur. I begin to think deep-fried things could be a lost health food. Everything has lightened again, not least because of the hefty slices of fresh red chilli. Inevitably, when so many items are at play, not everything can quite hit the mark. Barbecued candied pork jerky is a lot of great words pressed up against each other; in reality it\u2019s just an overly lean square of tough, sweet bacon. Their tea egg is a beautiful thing, with its gentle brown veining. It could be a prop in a horror sci-fi movie about alien spawn, just waiting to hatch. But it is another egg slow-cooked at 63C, with the unattractive jellied qualities those always bring, though the deep-fried shredded filo around it is a compulsive snack. It\u2019s also interesting to discover that China, a famously lactose- intolerant country, has a cheese, from Yunan, served fried. It\u2019s less interesting to discover it tastes exactly like halloumi.     \u2018As pale as a Jane Austen heroine, with a slight baby\u2019s-bum cleft and a hint of rosiness\u2019: custard buns. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    But now we are at the sweet end of the meal, which naturally enough begins with pork, a sweet fragrant stew of the stuff, inside a sugar-crusted bun. It\u2019s quite outrageous, and serves as a great support act to that final, perfect dessert: another bun, this time one as pale as a Jane Austen heroine, with a slight baby\u2019s-bum cleft and a hint of rosiness so it resembles a white peach \u2013 a notion emphasised by a leafed twig. It contains a liquid centre of aromatic duck-egg custard: the silkiest custard, the most aromatic custard, simply the best sweet custard it will ever be your luck to try. The bun has a crisped base, which is a perfect textural counterpoint to the liquid centre. And now look: I\u2019ve gone off on one. But it is a moment that simply stops all conversation and, with it, the meal. A Wong manages the clever trick of being a relaxed space in which to eat serious food. There\u2019s an open kitchen and a constant clatter, but at the heart of it are a bunch of dishes which punch above their weight at a good price. Granted we drank only water, but \u00a370 for two was a steal for food of this quality. I\u2019m late to review this restaurant, but can see why so many have already made such a fuss. I want to return to try the night-time dishes and the Peking duck tasting menu. And for the duck-egg custard bun of my sweaty palmed dreams. Jay\u2019s news bites \u25a0 Sometimes a dish comes along that seems to have been created just for me. Yup, I\u2019m that self-absorbed. So it is with the deep-fried pork ribs crusted with salt and chilli, in a huge pile of chillies and fried peas, served at Baiwei, a caf\u00e9 on Little Newport Street in London\u2019s Soho, and part of the Bar Shu Sichuan restaurant group.

Like an increasing number of young women lured from garment factories on the promise of better work and brighter horizons in China, she ended up sold to a stranger and trapped in a life of abuse as one of Cambodia\u2019s trafficked brides.  After months of sexual assault and domestic servitude, Phany escaped. What she never expected was that when she returned to Cambodia she would be treated as an outcast, her life still plagued by the horrors she had lived through. Every year, dozens of Cambodian women are trafficked to China and sold as brides. Although there is no official data available, one Cambodian human rights group, Adhoc, says it received 35 new cases last year. Foreign ministry spokesman Chum Sounry says that in 2015 the Cambodian government facilitated the return of 85 trafficked brides who had managed to reach a Cambodian consulate. Many others who are unaccounted for are thought to be trapped and unable to return home.   Related: A journey across four continents: Danziger's tales from Cambodia | Rory MacLean    \u201cYou can be sure that for every woman who escapes her captivity in China and returns to Cambodia, there are dozens more that never make it out,\u201d says Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division. China\u2019s former one-child policy and the preference for male children created such skewed sex ratios that some families are unable to find local women for their sons to marry. Poor villages in Cambodia have been increasingly seen by traffickers as a source of potential brides. They offer young women and their families \u2013 whose employment options often range little further than working in garment factories \u2013 decent work, better pay and more opportunities in China.  Phany, now 29, worked for six months as a poorly paid seamstress in a local factory. She decided to travel to China with her 20-year-old sister after her cousin introduced her to a Chinese couple who said they could offer her more lucrative factory work.  When they arrived in Shanghai they were met by a Cambodian man who said he was arranging work for them. The next day, the sisters were sold to two men who came to buy wives. One of the men paid cash for Phany and took her away, telling her that he was her new husband. They later registered their marriage, though Phany has never seen the documents. Phany\u2019s life became a cycle of physical, sexual and mental abuse as she carried out chores under the watchful eye of her husband and his mother. Unable to communicate through speech, her husband would rely on gestures to give orders, often becoming aggressive if they weren\u2019t obeyed. \u201cSometimes even if there wasn\u2019t any problem he\u2019d attack me,\u201d she says, as she mimicked her husband pulling at her hair and kicking her. She says she was frequently raped. In her six months in China, Phany tried to escape three times. The third time her husband caught her, he hit her repeatedly in the stomach before finally letting her go.  Borrowing money from her parents, she returned to Cambodia. \u201cI felt so happy. It was like being born again,\u201d she says. Yet when she returned to her community, she was treated as an outcast and blamed for the abuse that she\u2019d suffered. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to talk to me any more,\u201d she says, describing how her family had been torn apart by her experience.  Phany eventually left her village and went to work in Phnom Penh, where she says she can live a more anonymous life. \u201cI used to not want to get to know anybody because I didn\u2019t want to admit what happened to me,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I go back to my village I feel so ashamed. If the people around me wouldn\u2019t look down on me I would want to move back home.\u201d People who have been trafficked are legally entitled to support services but, with the government focusing on the prosecution of traffickers, this rarely materialises.  \u201cIt\u2019s a rule for the government to support victims who have returned but actually [there is] no support,\u201d says Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children\u2019s division at Adhoc, which last year helped more than a dozen trafficked women to return home.      Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children\u2019s division at Adhoc, bemoans the lack of support for trafficked brides returning to Cambodia. Photograph: Charlotte Pert    Sokunthea says the women who make it back are plagued with shame. They need counselling and recovery programmes but none exist. Many of the survivors supported by Adhoc refuse to seek legal action because of a reluctance to go public with what happened to them and a lack of faith in Cambodia\u2019s justice system. Those who do try to seek justice are often let down.  A number of cases have made it to the court in recent years, but prosecutions are entirely of low-level brokers. Khieu Sopheak, spokesman for the ministry of the interior, says the people heading the trafficking gangs are \u201cprotected and many are not in Cambodia\u201d. Nary*, 22, who returned to her home in northern Cambodia in September after four years as a trafficked bride in China, hasn\u2019t spoken to anyone in her community about her marriage.    Related: Brides for sale: trafficked Vietnamese girls sold into marriage in China    Unlike Phany, Nary knew she would have to marry to stay in China, but had no idea of the life that awaited her.  \u201cNot only my husband had sex with me but also his father and his relatives. In my first month I was just a housewife but after three months everything changed,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody came to have sex with me any time they needed to.\u201d She says that if anyone discovered what happened to her she would be cast out of her community. \u201cIf any men know that I was married there, they won\u2019t love me. I try to bury my past because it makes me so angry when I think about it or even when I hear anyone mention China.\u201d For Phany, pretending that her life in China didn\u2019t exist is the only way she knows to survive. \u201cI think about it but I try not to do that too much. I\u2019m worried that if I do I\u2019ll make myself ill,\u201d she says. \u201cI have never forgotten what happened there. I still remember even though I want to forget.

Fifty Shades of Grey spoof Fifty Shades of Black failed to perform, taking just $6.1m in ninth place. The film sees Scary Movie regular Marlon Wayans as Christian Black, a riff on EL James\u2019 kinky businessman Christian Grey from the popular erotic romance novels and film.

The really big names that can be tempted to leave Europe often go to MLS \u2013 Beckham, Lampard, Henry, Gerrard, Kaka and Pirlo \u2013 but China is increasingly able to pay big money (often too big at the moment but that is due to necessity more than naivety) for players that are not quite so stellar but are usually much closer to their prime. Guangzhou have Ricardo Goulart, still only 24 and regarded as one of the top Brazilian prospects a year ago when he left Cruzerio, while Beijing Guoan has Renato Augusto one of four players from Brazilian champions Corinthians to make a recent move to China. East Asia is still a relative culture shock for players based in South America or Europe than North America but a growing number of Chinese clubs can offer huge salaries with Renato Augusto more than quadrupling his.

Related: Jackson Mart\u00ednez completes Guangzhou Evergrande move from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid    In terms of attendances, MLS and China are similar but perhaps not for long. The 2016 Super League season, set to kick off in March, is the most eagerly-awaited yet. Last year saw an average attendance of just over 22,000, less than two hundred behind Italy and France. A high-ranking league official told the Guardian that this season will see the 25,000 barrier broken and predicts that by 2018, the Chinese Super League will be the third most-watched football league in terms of average attendance in the world behind the Bundesliga and the English Premier League. There\u2019s money, the political will, the infrastructure, the passion, the ambition and plenty of potential. Talk in Europe of whether the spending is sustainable is misguided. This is just one of many examples of the world\u2019s second largest economy flexing its financial muscles. It is already having an effect at home. In 2015 Chinese broadcasters paid just $9m to show local league games. In 2016 it will be over $200m as part of a $1.25bn package over the next five seasons. Guangzhou Evergrande has become the prime mover in China after being taken over by a huge property developer. Five Chinese titles, two Asian Champions Leagues and two World Cup winning coaches later, the Cantonese giant wants to win the Fifa Club World Cup. With Robinho, Paulinho, Goulart, Luiz Felipe Scolari, much of the Chinese national team and an average attendance of over 45,000, it is already Asia\u2019s premier club. Shanghai SIPG was runner-up in 2015 but Sven Goran Eriksson lost out once again to Scolari. The Swede has been spending big, paying around $50m for Ghanaian goal-king Asamoah Gyan and Brazilian striker Elkeson. The club still wants Robin van Persie or Wayne Rooney. Shanghai Shenhua has Demba Ba, Fredy Guarin and Tim Cahill. Beijing Guoan risks getting left behind but still had 42,000 applications for 27,000 season tickets earlier this month. Beijing has Serie A winning coach Alberto Zaccheroni in the hotseat and, as well as Scolari and Sven at Evergrande and SIPG, there\u2019s ex-Brazil boss Mano Menezes at Shandong Luneng and Dragan Stojkovic, not long ago tipped to be Arsene Wenger\u2019s Arsenal successor, with Guangzhou R&amp;F. Whatever the past failings of the Chinese system, the country\u2019s best players are increasingly being coached by well-regarded international names. The spending has been encouraged by a government headed by big soccer fan Xi Jinping. The president was tired of the world\u2019s most populous country continually failing at the world\u2019s most popular game. Wealthy businessmen get involved, in part, to curry favor and craft links with the politicians and even perhaps, to make money. Guangzhou may have spent over $150m on players and coaches since 2010 but Evergrande, who bought the club for $16m, sold 50% of it for $190m to internet giant Alibaba \u2013 just four years later. There is still, of course, much work to be done to improve the standard of local players. As well as in terms of men\u2019s national teams, China lags behind the United States in a big way when it comes to participation. Soccer may be the most played sport among American youth but kids rarely play the game in the Middle Kingdom often due to a lack of places to play or the preference of parents to have their (usually only) offspring aim for a \u201creal\u201d job rather than professional football. The government has launched a scheme to get kids playing football at school and the target in 2017 is to have 20,000 schools playing the sport on a weekly basis. This is set to be expanded in a big way. Guangzhou has built what is purported to be the biggest soccer academy in the world (helped by Real Madrid) and the fact that there is more money coming into the game \u2013 such as from the new television deal and increasing corporate interest \u2013 should feed through to local players further down the chain, making professional football an increasingly attractive option a decade from now. By that time, the league should be thriving. Producing more local talent would mean that the league would be less reliant on foreign stars, though the money is likely to be there regardless of any wider economic problems. It is debatable as to which league is the best outside Europe but whichever it is, China is catching fast. That may not matter much to fans in North America but is another sign that the balance of power is moving east along with Gervinho, Ramires and who knows who else?", "tags": ["MLS", "China", "Football", "US sports", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-01T09:00:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/chinas-coolest-grandpa-85-year-old-unlikely-fashion-icon", "sentences": ["Today, China\u2019s most glamorous grandfather boasts 10 grandchildren spread between the eastern cities of Xiamen, Shanghai and Fuzhou."], "title": "China's coolest grandpa: farmer, 85, catapulted to fashion fame", "article": " An elderly Chinese farmer who has lived through famine, civil war, revolution and one of the greatest economic booms in history has spoken of his delight at becoming an unlikely international fashion icon in his twilight years. Ding Bingcai, 85, was catapulted into the headlines last month after his photographer grandson, Ding Guoliang, 30, made him the star of a fashion shoot for which he donned green, blue and mulberry suits, tartan bow ties, designer glasses and fedoras.  Photographs of the dapper grandfather-of-10 \u2013 who had never before worn a suit \u2013 quickly went viral with internet users anointing him \u201cChina\u2019s coolest grandpa\u201d.  One Chinese newspaper claimed the octogenarian trendsetter had achieved world-class levels of charm.

The retired farmer said he was unable to pick his favourite look from his menswear collection. \u201cI like all of them,\u201d he told the Guardian.      Ding Bingcai. Photograph: Ding Guoliang    Even more remarkable than Ding\u2019s rise to fashion fame are the staggering social and political upheavals he has witnessed during his life.  Ding was born in 1931, six years after the death of China\u2019s first president, Sun Yat-sen, and almost two decades before Chairman Mao\u2019s communists seized power in 1949.  He grew up in Songshuping, a rural village on the outskirts of Fujian province\u2019s Shaowu city and became a subsistence farmer, growing rice and cutting bamboo for a living.      Ding Bingcai, in a photo by his grandson. Photograph: Xiao Ye Jie Xi    Ding was in his late twenties when Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward push for industrialisation caused a calamitous famine that devastated rural China and is thought to have claimed up to 45 million lives. \u201cIt was very hard in the past,\u201d Ding recalled of those days. \u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t have enough food to eat. [We were] always starving. Back then, we had no money. Things are much better now.\u201d    Related: Fashion design in China:  \u2018The trick is to embrace the chaos\u2019    In 1961, as the three-year Great Famine came to an end, Ding married his childhood sweetheart, Zhang Jiyu. Over the coming years the couple had five children; two daughters and three sons. Today, China\u2019s most glamorous grandfather boasts 10 grandchildren spread between the eastern cities of Xiamen, Shanghai and Fuzhou. His wife passed away in 2014.  Ding Guoliang, a professional photographer who uses the name Jesse, said the three-day photo session, which took place last September on the streets of Xiamen, was intended to make his grandfather feel both useful and elegant.

He decided he wanted to take out his cigarettes and share them with everybody else. He felt everybody was his friend. He is really honest and simple.\u201d  Ding said his elderly grandfather had struggled to fully comprehend the extent of his fame.  \u201c[But] he is happy that people are being nice to him and to be welcomed by so many people. In fact, noise and excitement is what elderly people need the most. Having people pay attention to him and having a sense of existing are important to him,\u201d he added. \u201cI want my grandpa to feel that he is useful.\u201d  Asked how he felt about becoming an internet celebrity, 85-year-old Ding was coy.  \u201cI am not good at talking,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that OK?\u201d  Additional reporting by Christy Yao ", "tags": ["China", "Older people", "Fashion", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-01T09:19:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/02/at-least-100000-chinese-new-year-travellers-stuck-at-railway-station", "sentences": ["Photograph: China Photos/Getty Images    A fatal stampede on Shanghai\u2019s historic riverfront Bund on 31 December 2014 claimed dozens of lives and sparked a major political scandal in China\u2019s skyscraper-packed financial capital."], "title": "At least 100,000 Chinese new year travellers stuck at railway station", "article": "Poor weather left at least 100,000 travellers stranded in a train station in southern China on Monday as they battled to return home ahead of Chinese New Year celebrations next week.

The FTSE 100 index in London lost 4.9% in 2015, while on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 edged up 0.7%. In China, the Shanghai Composite gained 9.4%. The whisky market is booming: the total value of rare whiskies sold at auction in the UK last year was \u00a39.6m, up from \u00a37.6m in 2014, according to consultancy Rare Whisky 101.

This compares with 4,072 rare bottles sold in 2009. Interest in whisky as an investment has steadily grown, partly fuelled by collectors in east Asia, and online platform Whiskyinvestdirect was launched last year, which allows people to buy and sell units of whisky at wholesale prices as it matures in the barrel. Andy Simpson, a whisky investment analyst and the co-founder of Rare Whisky 101, said: \u201cThe recent growth in the rare whisky market has exceeded all our forecasts. The coming year promises to bring even more supply to the market as new auction houses appear.  \u201cWhile the sustainability of these volume increases could be called into question, we know for certain that the true rarities will only become rarer.

His team were out of the bottom three, his job was considerably more secure than at 3pm and, for once, there seemed cause for cautious optimism on Tyneside. Complemented by Andros Townsend\u2019s promising home debut, Steven Taylor\u2019s assured return to central defence and Cheick Tiot\u00e9\u2019s no-nonsense dictation of midfield, Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s first-half winner proved sufficient to undo Tony Pulis deeply underwhelming, if injury-hit, side. \u201cThat\u2019s the most disappointing game we\u2019ve played since I\u2019ve been at the club,\u201d said West Brom\u2019s manager, who admitted his players have yet to banish their own, albeit outside, relegation fears. \u201cWe shadow boxed for 90 minutes. Newcastle were better than us all over the pitch; we couldn\u2019t get near them. Nobody in the bottom half of the table will think they\u2019re safe and we\u2019re no different, but my players are human beings and human beings have days like this.\u201d If Pulis could have done with the absent Jonny Evans, Chris Brunt and James Morrison, Newcastle, too, were somewhat patched up with Taylor back in defence after five months on the sidelines following hamstring surgery, Tiot\u00e9 restored to midfield after the collapse of a mooted move to China and Rolando Aarons, a winger filling in admirably at left back. \u201cThe heroes today were Steven Taylor, Cheick Tiot\u00e9 and Rolando Aarons,\u201d said McClaren who was relieved to begin erasing the memory of last Wednesday\u2019s abject 3-0 defeat at Everton. \u201cThis was a big game and these are three enormous points.\u201d But for Ben Foster the margin of victory would surely have been greater. West Brom\u2019s goalkeeper swiftly showed some reassuringly sharp reflexes and did well to repel Andros Townsend\u2019s 20-yard shot before denying Mitrovic from two yards. Scruffy, scrappy and with Darren Fletcher fighting a forlorn battle to bring some cohesion to their play while Sandro struggled to second guess Gini Wijnaldum, Pulis\u2019s players seemed barely capable of escaping their own half. Apparently unable to string a couple of passes together, they retreated ever deeper with Townsend\u2019s two footed ability clearly fazing James Chester. Tiot\u00e9 \u2013 who had seemed destined to be in Shanghai by now \u2013 thought he had scored a fabulous goal from 25 yards only to see it disallowed as Mitrovic was blocking Foster\u2019s sight-line while occupying an offside position. No matter; home fans were soon celebrating after Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s smart through ball prefaced Mitrovic sliding an accomplished low shot beyond the advancing Foster. When Craig Gardner subsequently dodged Aarons and directed the ball low across goal McClaren swore profusely but, as James McClean shaped to shoot, Daryl Janmaat\u2019s last-ditch interception rescued the situation. Newcastle\u2019s manager probably cursed some more when Pulis brought Berahino \u2013 the subject of a failed \u00a321m bid from St James\u2019 Park last week \u2013 on for the second half. Sure enough, Berahino\u2019s lovely touch created a shooting chance blasted wildly over by Alex Pritchard. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a shot, we\u2019ve had a shot,\u201d sang West Brom\u2019s increasingly sarcastic travelling support. Berahino \u2013 by now not having to merely cope with Taylor\u2019s intelligent marking but further close attention from Tiot\u00e9 \u2013 later had a shot blocked, Wijnaldum headed just over the bar and Townsend struck a post. \u201cWe had so many chances we should have won by more than 1-0 but we thoroughly deserved it,\u201d said McClaren who received a big hug from Tiot\u00e9 at the end. \u201cWe were hugely disappointed and angry after Everton, but we got the perfect reaction.\u201d", "tags": ["Premier League", "Newcastle United", "West Bromwich Albion", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-06T17:26:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/08/watch-this-best-tv-monday-8-february", "sentences": ["As one PT instructor shrieks, in a surely well-honed line: \u201cThis is the Royal Navy, not the Royal Mail!\u201d Ali Catterall Rick Stein\u2019sTaste Of Shanghai 9pm, BBC2 Stein\u2019s introduction notes that Shanghai has a distinctive flavour in many respects \u2013 a legendarily raffish and rumbustious port which was, for years, open to the world in a way that much of China wasn\u2019t.", "However, Shanghai\u2019s relatively recent emergence as a global financial hub has transformed its cuisine still further, as western restaurateurs follow the money, but here Stein is searching for old-school, authentic Shanghai cuisine, visiting restaurants, seafood markets and a rice winery."], "title": "Monday\u2019s best TV: Pocket Money Pitch, Rick Stein\u2019s Taste of Shanghai, The X-Files, Inside Amy Schumer, Royal Navy Sailor School", "article": "Pocket Money Pitch5.30pm, CBBC Young entrepreneurs are invited into a mini Dragons\u2019 Den in this new series for inventive eight- to 14-year-olds.

Even if global warming is capped at governments\u2019 target of 2C - which is already seen as difficult - 20% of the world\u2019s population will eventually have to migrate away from coasts swamped by rising oceans. Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged.   Populations at risk from sea-level rise   \u201cMuch of the carbon we are putting in the air from burning fossil fuels will stay there for thousands of years,\u201d said Prof Peter Clark, at Oregon State University in the US and who led the new work. \u201cPeople need to understand that the effects of climate change won\u2019t go away, at least not for thousands of generations.\u201d \u201cThe long-term view sends the chilling message of what the real risks and consequences are of the fossil fuel era,\u201d said Prof Thomas Stocker, at the University of Bern, Switzerland and also part of the research team. \u201cIt will commit us to massive adaptation efforts so that for many, dislocation and migration becomes the only option.\u201d The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, notes most research looks at the impacts of global warming by 2100 and so misses one of the biggest consequences for civilisation - the long-term melting of polar ice caps and sea-level rise.  This is because the great ice sheets take thousand of years to react fully to higher temperatures. The researchers say this long-term view raises moral questions about the kind of environment being passed down to future generations. The research shows that even with climate change limited to 2C by tough emissions cuts, sea level would rise by 25 metres over the next 2,000 years or so and remain there for at least 10,000 years - twice as long as human history. If today\u2019s burning of coal, oil and gas is not curbed, the sea would rise by 50m, completely changing the map of the world. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep building seawalls that are 25m high,\u201d said Clark. \u201cEntire populations of cities will eventually have to move.\u201d By far the greatest contributor to the sea level rise - about 80% - would be the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Another new study in Nature Climate Change published on Monday reveals that some large Antarctic ice sheets are dangerously close to losing the sea ice shelves that hold back their flow into the ocean. Huge floating sea ice shelves around Antarctica provide buttresses for the glaciers and ice sheets on the continent. But when they are lost to melting, as happened the with Larsen B shelf in 2002, the speed of flow into the ocean can increase eightfold. Johannes Fu\u0308rst, at the University of Erlangen-Nu\u0308rnberg in Germany and colleagues, calculated that just 5% of the ice shelf in the Bellingshausen Sea and 7% in the Amundsen Sea can be lost before their buttressing effect vanishes. \u201cThis is worrying because it is in these regions that we have observed the highest rates of ice-shelf thinning over the past two decades,\u201d he said. Avoiding the long-term swamping of many of the world\u2019s greatest cities is already difficult, given the amount carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere. \u201cSea-level rise is already baked into the system,\u201d said Prof Stocker, one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists. However, the rise could be reduced and delayed if carbon is removed from the atmosphere in the future, he said: \u201cIf you are very optimistic and think we will be in the position by 2050 or 2070 to have a global scale carbon removal scheme - which sounds very science fiction - you could pump down CO2 levels. But there is no indication that this is technically possible.\u201d A further difficulty is the large amount of heat and CO2 already stored in the oceans. Prof Stocker said: \u201cThe actions of the next 30 years are absolutely crucial for putting us on a path that avoids the [worst] outcomes and ensuring, at least in the next 200 years, the impacts are limited and give us time to adapt.\u201d The researchers argue that a new industrial revolution is required to deliver a global energy system that emits no carbon at all. They conclude: \u201cThe success of the [UN climate summit in] Paris meeting, and of every future meeting, must be evaluated not only by levels of national commitments, but also by looking at how they will lead ultimately to the point when zero-carbon energy systems become the obvious choice for everyone.\u201d \u201cWe are making choices that will affect our grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren and beyond,\u201d said Prof Daniel Schrag, at Harvard University in the US. \u201cWe need to think carefully about the long timescales of what we are unleashing.\u201d", "tags": ["Sea level", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Oceans", "Sea ice", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-08T16:00:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/09/the-x-files-channel-5-highest-rating-us-drama-launch-since-2009", "sentences": ["The X-Files gave Channel 5 something of a slot victory trumping BBC1\u2019s Crimewatch, BBC2\u2019s Rick Stein\u2019s Taste of Shanghai and Channel 4\u2019s debut of Royal Navy School."], "title": "X-Files gives Channel 5 highest rating US drama launch since 2009", "article": "The return of The X-Files on Monday drew almost 3.5 million viewers giving Channel 5 its highest-rating show in over a year.

Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets since the 2008 financial crisis, but they could be in for a turbulent year if potential flashpoints such as emerging markets or the energy sector produce a cascade of debt defaults. Here are the five biggest threats to the banking sector: China A property boom and frenzy of manufacturing in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash kept the global economy motoring, but stored up huge private debts that investors fear will soon destabilise the Chinese economy.      A Chinese investor monitors stock prices in a brokerage house in Beijing. Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP    Beijing is working hard to wean itself off being the world\u2019s source of cheap manufactured goods, but it is a painful transition, full of pitfalls. Some banks have called in bad loans, forcing firms to go bust. But these are rare, leaving international investors to fear that more are in the pipeline, without knowing the extent of the problem.  Property developments and infrastructure projects stand half-finished while the authorities take stock of the situation.  Some analysts fear Beijing is covertly depreciating the yuan to gain a competitive advantage while it moves towards a more western-style consumer economy. That would spark a currency war and a wave of competitive devaluations. The stock market is dominated by individual investors who treat the market like a casino. Efforts to shift share ownership to institutional investors and impose stricter regulations have proved ineffective so far, leaving the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to cope with wild swings each time there is bad economic news. Emerging markets The list of developing nations suffering the after effects of the slowing global economy and the slump in oil prices grows every week.      Soldiers holds a portrait of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Photograph: Federico Parra/AFP/Getty Images    Last year, Brazil slid into a recession made worse by a corruption scandal that could topple the government. Venezuela\u2019s ailing post-Hugo Ch\u00e1vez administration is expected to default on its loans after oil revenues dried up.  Nigeria, Russia and the Middle Eastern producers are also badly hit by falling oil prices, leaving government budgets under water. Turkey, South Africa and Mexico are braced for corporate insolvencies after strong signals from the US Federal Reserve that years of borrowing heavily at rock bottom interest rates will soon come to an end. The Fed raised rates in December and could do so again soon, jeopardising the finances of large corporations that borrowed heavily in dollars.  East Asian economies Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, which depend on trade with China\u2019s manufacturing sector, are suffering a dramatic slowdown as the world\u2019s second-largest economy focuses on tackling corruption and boosting consumer demand. Sovereign debts that only last year appeared to be manageable are coming under scrutiny by the international ratings agencies.  Only India, which is large enough to be relatively insulated from the recent market turmoil, has maintained its growth, outstripping Beijing\u2019s official 6.9% rate with a 7.5% expansion in 2015. Eurozone When the European Central Bank cut its already ultra-low main interest rate from 0.15% to 0.05% in the autumn of 2014, the Ukraine crisis was cited as a risk to Europe\u2019s hopes of recovery.      Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters    Since then, the Syria crisis and the exodus of refugees to Europe\u2019s shores has become a more serious threat to the stability of the 19-member currency bloc and the ECB has cut rates further and hinted of more to come next month.  While stock markets have welcomed cheaper borrowing costs, fears that European banks have returned to their bad old ways and become embroiled in risky lending has come to dominate discussions in the City.  Bank shares, led by Deutsche Bank and Barclays, dived this week as investors scrambled to buy safer assets.  Some countries are suffering more than others. Finland has fallen into a recession deeper than anything Portugal experienced. France is lagging and Italy\u2019s burst of activity last year is waning. Worse, Germany\u2019s industrial output has come under pressure from the decline in trade along the Silk Road that leads back to China.  Oil JP Morgan believes the exposure to the oil sector of US and European banks amounts to about $250bn (\u00a3173bn), although it thinks big losses on that money are unlikely.     The Bahrain International Airshow in Sakhir, Bahrain. Photograph: Hasan Jamali/AP    The oil industry had $455bn of bonds outstanding in 2006, but that figure increased to $1.4tn by 2014, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Oil companies had $1.6tn of syndicated loans in 2014, although that does not take into account repayments or loans that were never drawn. Both numbers are likely to have increased significantly since the BIS last crunched the numbers. Debts have ballooned in part because of the boom in shale oil and gas extraction in the US. Companies borrowed heavily to fund investment in shale when the oil price was high. Now that prices have tumbled, those debts look increasingly unsustainable. America\u2019s second-biggest natural gas firm, Chesapeake Energy, threatens to provide the first significant example of a big company driven under by debt. It was forced to deny this week that it was on the verge of bankruptcy, with debts of $10bn and a market value of just $1.2bn. It is not just in the US where such disasters could arise. Firms that operate in regions where it costs a lot to extract oil, such as the UK North Sea, are seeing their profits wiped out.  Prolonged rock-bottom oil prices raise the prospect that some of these oil and gas companies will default on their debts, sending shockwaves through lenders such as banks and bond investors.  There is also a knock-on effect in countries that rely on oil reserves for income. Falling oil revenues result in lower tax receipts, which could force greater austerity and depress economic activity further, triggering debt defaults across a variety of businesses. Commodities In a report at the end of last year, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s warned of a \u201cspike in defaults\u201d among commodity companies, as well as oil producers.     1kg gold bar. Photograph: Ruben Sprich/Reuters    \u201cThe sheer volume of commodity-related debt poses challenges because it means that credit losses from commodity investments will be substantial for many investors,\u201d said Mariarosa Verde, Moody\u2019s group credit officer. The group said $2tn of bonds had been issued by mining companies since 2010, many of them now rated as junk, meaning there is a high risk investors will not get their money back. Mining companies have suffered badly because they spent big when metals prices were high and cannot sustain their operating costs now that prices are low. One of the hardest hit has been commodities giant Glencore, which has $36bn of net debt and a market value of $20bn. Observers have warned that because Glencore\u2019s metals trading arm deals with so many companies around the world, it poses a risk. If it were to fall into severe financial trouble, it might trigger a Lehman Brothers-style event, creating a domino effect of debt similar to the banking crisis of 2008. Bank of America has estimated that the financial sector\u2019s exposure to Glencore could be as high as $100bn \u2013 and that\u2019s just one company. The company has insisted that it has plenty of financial room for manoeuvre if things get tight and it has since moved to cut its debts. But ultra-low commodity prices could cause big problems for more than just the banks and investors who lend to mining firms.  For instance, the copper price has more than halved to below $2/lb since 2011. This is largely because China\u2019s slowdown means the metal, used in electrical wiring among other things, is not in such demand. The economy of some countries \u2013 such as Zambia, for instance \u2013 are built almost entirely on copper. Low metals prices could force mining-dependent countries to default on their debts, spreading the problem to sovereign debt markets. too.", "tags": ["Global economy", "Banking", "Banks and building societies", "Business", "Financial crisis", "Stock markets", "Chinese economy", "Emerging markets", "Eurozone", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "Commodities", "Energy industry", "Financial sector", "China", "Economics", "World news", "European banks"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-10T06:00:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/10/chelsea-loic-remy-chinese-super-league", "sentences": ["Related: Massimiliano Allegri dismisses Chelsea link and stays focused on Juventus    On Tuesday, the French website Le10 Sport reported that negotiations were ongoing between Chelsea and Shanghai Shenhua, with R\u00e9my offered around \u20ac7m a year in wages."], "title": "Chelsea\u2019s Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my linked with move to Chinese Super League", "article": "Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my is reportedly weighing up an offer to move to the Chinese Super League after claims in France that Chelsea have agreed in principle to accept a \u20ac20m offer for the striker.

He went beyond personal stories to talk about how you actually make changes in society  Xiaogang Wei     China Daily described Qiu\u2019s comments as \u201can uncharacteristically bold move\u201d and Beijing-based LGBT-rights activist Bin Xu said they were \u201creally surprising\u201d.  Qiu was picked as person of the year in 2016\u2019s Rainbow Media Awards (RMA), which celebrate responsible reporting of LGBT issues in China. At the end of last year Qiu produced and hosted his own current affairs show about several lawsuits brought by LGBT people in China.  \u201cIt was really important because he went beyond personal stories to talk about how you actually make changes in society,\u201d says Xiaogang Wei, co-founder of the RMA and executive director of NGO Beijing Gender Health Education Institute. Inspired by the Glaad awards, which celebrate responsible coverage of LGBT people in the US, RMA launched in 2011. \u201cWe wanted to engage the media to be more involved in LGBTI issues,\u201d says Wei. \u201cWe decided it was better to award them rather than criticise. So we came up with this idea to encourage more friendly media.\u201d     Qiu Qiming with his Rainbow Media Award. Photograph: Hemu    At the first ceremony none of the winners turned up to accept their awards. But at the 2016 awards in January, all the winners were there to receive their accolades and made gushing speeches. \u201cThey said really nice things on stage,\u201d says Wei. \u201cThey talked about why they decided to write this article and how they felt about it.\u201d There are signs that LGBT rights in China are slowly progressing. Following a history scattered with references to gay men \u2013 like Emperor Ai who legend has it cut off his sleeve rather than wake his male lover during the Han dynasty (206BC to AD220) \u2013 homosexuality was stigmatised after the communist revolution in 1949, because it was associated with western decadence. The ministry of health removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 2001 and Shanghai has held an annual Pride celebration (but not a march \u2013 marches are tricky in China) since 2009. Wei says negative, stereotyping and disrespectful media coverage of LGBT people is less common than it was five years ago. \u201cIn 2012 we only had 365 reports on LGBTI issues in the media. But in 2015 we had 867 reports. It has increased a lot. And the reports are also more objective, more positive.\u201d RMA is now working with UN development programme and academics to produce a more official report on the national media\u2019s coverage of LGBT issues.     A still from the film Mama Rainbow, about the relationship between gay children and their parents, made by filmmaker Fan Popo. Photograph: Fan Popo    Since starting the awards, the group behind them have expanded what they do to offer media training for LGBT-rights organisations and LGBT-rights training for journalists. At the trainings all over the country, journalists tell Wei that it is still very difficult to get editors to cover LGBT issues, especially in China\u2019s interior cities. \u201cOne journalist told me she tried to pitch the story for over a year and finally it was published,\u201d says Wei. \u201cBut that really encouraged me that some journalists are making the effort, not just LGBTI organisations.\u201d    Related: Electric shocks, rape and submersion: 'gay cures' and the fight to end them    Wei says that while coverage of LGBT issues is getting more positive and understanding, it still needs to be more diverse. \u201cLGBT reports have seen a lot of improvement,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to do. We might have gay or lesbian people in the media \u2013 but not transgender, intersex, bisexual or queer people. There are still a lot of things that need to be more reported on so there are more voices.\u201d LGBT people are getting more legal recognition in China, as well as media recognition. A series of lawsuits have brought publicity and energy to various aspects of the fight for LGBT rights, although the court wins were largely symbolic. From 1 May last year, new legislation meant it is now easier to sue in China. This has seen a 29% rise in cases, including some ridiculous ones like the man suing an actress for staring at him through a TV screen. LGBT rights activists are using the new rules to their advantage. A gay couple are currently suing for the right to get married and last August student Chen Qiuyan sued about the description of homosexuality as a mental disorder in university textbooks. Filmmaker Fan Popo sued the government for taking his documentary Mama Rainbow down from the internet. He won the case in December but the film is still unavailable to see online on Chinese hosting sites.  Decisive action from the authorities may be lacking, but judges are hearing cases, and messages are getting out in the media about LGBT people\u2019s right to exist. \u201cOf course it\u2019s great for LGBT organisations to use the law in a positive way,\u201d says Wei. \u201cAt least now that we know that if we sue the Chinese government, you might win.\u201d From 8-14 February the Guardian Global Development Professionals Network is highlighting the work of LGBT rights activists throughout the world.

That\u2019s right people, it seems we\u2019ve reached the point where everyone has forgotten about all the unpleasant stuff Jos\u00e9 Mourinho did and just wants him back again. Not only is Jos\u00e9\u2019s return to England pretty much a done deal, according to the nose-tappers of the land, but he\u2019s already started planning who he will keep, who he\u2019ll buy and who he\u2019ll cordially invite to the Do One summer ball at Manchester United.

Hello, pretty much any good footballer you can think of on whom Jos\u00e9 will spend his \u00a3300m war chest!    Related: Laurent Blanc signs two-year contract extension at Paris Saint-Germain    Nobody seems quite sure at the moment whether it will be hello or goodbye to trusty ol\u2019 Michael Carrick, though, as he\u2019s not been told either way whether he\u2019s staying or going, with his contract due to expire in the summer. He will not, however, \u2018do a John Terry\u2019 by trying to force the club into giving him what he wants, like a demanding child who wants a cookie and he wants it now.  Meanwhile, across town, Pep Guardiola is making plans for when he takes over at Manchester City, and most of them seem to involve recruiting a new goalkeeper, oddly. Apparently he\u2019s going to give old pal V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s a shout, and not just because he might know where the best place to get a good craft beer is, but rather to play betwixt the sticks. Meanwhile reports in Italy suggest that the Internazionale stopper Samir Handanovi\u0107 is more Pep\u2019s bag, and will join City\u2019s plucky band of merry upstarts in the summer, leading one to have that rarest of sensations \u2013 sympathy for Joe Hart. Pep will also see if Sergio Busquets meant what he said and is up for joining him too, so that City will at least have one competent midfielder to go with their fistful of keepers. City are also kicking the tyres of Leandro Paredes, the Roma midfielder who has been doing lovely things on loan at Empoli, while Roberto Mancini wants an emotional reunion with Pablo Zabaleta at Inter.  One man who won\u2019t be in Manchester next season, but might be just up the road, is one Javier Hern\u00e1ndez. According to, you know, people, J\u00fcrgen Klopp is most impressed with what he\u2019s seen from the little pea while playing for Bayer Leverkeusen so reckons he could be just the job to get Liverpool scoring again. After all, if you\u2019re charging \u00a359 for a ticket even after landing yourself some decent PR by graciously deciding not to fleece your fans for even more, you need to provide some sort of entertainment. Arsenal are keen on that one, too. A little ballast, to go with the goals, will be provided by the Schalke defender/midfielder Jo\u00ebl Matip, out of contract in the summer and thus free to go wherever he likes. Klopp hopes that of all the infinite possibilities in the world, of all the places he could go, of all the myriad experiences he could choose to engage with, Matip will choose Liverpool.  Down at Chelsea, things are in flux. Roman Abramovich isn\u2019t sure he wants Diego Simeone, worried about his playing style rather than him looking like a pricey assassin.

Woodward had been expected to face a grilling from shareholders with United having departed the Champions League at the group stage, their manager\u2019s job frequently linked with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and the team six points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City.   Related: Manchester United on course to earn \u00a3500m in single year    Instead, he was given the tamest of rides from representatives of JP Morgan and Credit Suisse, among others, with questions including the impact of the Chinese Super League on transfer fees, ticket prices, the youth academy, apparel opportunities and the expansion of the Old Trafford retail store. One investor did ask what impact failing to qualify for the Champions League would have on employees\u2019 expenses \u2013 players\u2019 wages \u2013 but those financially sensitive figures were not forthcoming. The most pointed football question related to United\u2019s return in the transfer market, with more than \u00a3250m spent under Van Gaal compared with the \u00a322.25m Leicester City team who convincingly beat Manchester City to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League. \u201cLeicester is a fantastic reference point for everybody this year,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cThe philosophy we have is to target quality of players based on the huge amount of scouting we do and analysis within the training ground, and then we do our best to do the best deal we can. \u201cSome players are bought by other clubs with an eye to them developing into something special in a few years\u2019 time whereas there\u2019s perhaps more pressure on bigger clubs to bring in players who are going to hit the ground running, top players verging on world class almost immediately. There is a slightly different market in which people are buying.\u201d While on-the-pitch matters may not be the investors\u2019 primary concern, the performance of Van Gaal\u2019s team and the club\u2019s financial results are inextricably linked. On Monday, United\u2019s share price dropped below $14 for the first time since flotation in 2012, before recovering later in the day. But unlike in February 2014, when Woodward was forced to deny United would suffer financial damage if David Moyes failed to secure Champions League qualification, he did not have to refer to Van Gaal or his team\u2019s results once.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho may look outside the Premier League for his next job    The first question concerned the ramifications of the Chinese Super League\u2019s extravagant spending on Premier League transfer fees. \u201cOf course it can [have an impact],\u201d said Woodward. \u201cThis [summer] will be the biggest window in preparation for next season after real movement in interest following the premier\u2019s comments on it [president Xi Jinping\u2019s declaration that China will become a \u201csoccer powerhouse\u201d]. \u201cI do think there will be more activity coming in the summer but it\u2019s very difficult to predict what impact it will have. If nothing else, it\u2019s another useful market if we are looking to sell any players.\u201d Wayne Rooney was linked with Shanghai SIPG, who are managed by Sven-Goran Eriksson, in December. Woodward announced that a significant appointment is imminent at United\u2019s youth academy, which has been without a manager since Brian McClair left for the Scottish Football Association in June. Asked about the academy, overshadowed by Manchester City\u2019s investment in young talent and new facilities, Woodward said it is \u201cat the heart of the club\u201d. \u201cGiving youth a chance is part of our DNA,\u201d he added. \u201cBrian McClair\u2019s departure gave us an opportunity to conduct a root-and-branch review. That is completed and announcements will follow in the coming days. Our key competitive advantages are still very strong. We have an unmatched track record of player development compared to any other team in England and the runway to our first team is very different to some of our competitors.\u201d On the current controversy surrounding Premier League ticket prices, the United official said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on what other clubs have done. The Premier League is looking at options to help away fans. There were discussions happening at last week\u2019s Premier League meeting and indeed behind closed doors now and into the next meeting in March when we will deliver something more to away fans.   Related: Football quiz: ticket prices    \u201cBut that is only part of it to us. We are working closely with our supporters\u2019 trust to assess what we can do for our fans. Our general admission season tickets have been frozen for the past five years and into next year. That is as good a guidance as any to where we are on admission.\u201d Woodward was speaking after United posted second-quarter results for the 2016 fiscal year, showing commercial revenues of \u00a366.1m for the three-month period ending 31 December 2015 (a 42.5% increase on 2014\u2019s figure of \u00a346.4m) and broadcasting revenues of \u00a337.3m. They were up 31.3% on the previous year\u2019s figure of \u00a328.4m, when United were without Champions League football. Matchday revenue, however, was down \u00a3500,000 to \u00a330.4m, primarily because of two fewer Premier League home matches and the Argentina v Portugal friendly that took place at Old Trafford in November 2014. Profit for the second quarter was \u00a327.8m before tax but the club\u2019s astronomical debt under the Glazers\u2019 ownership stands at \u00a3322.1m, a 6.2% decrease on the 2014 level of \u00a3343.4m. United\u2019s accounts project revenue to be \u00a3500m-510m for the financial year and adjusted EBITDA (profit before depreciation, amortisation, profit/loss on disposal of players\u2019 registrations, exceptional items, net finance costs and tax) at \u00a3178m-188m. The executive vice-chairman commented: \u201cOur strong commitment to investing in our squad, youth academy and the broader club are ultimately underpinned by our financial strength and the hard work and dedication of everyone at the club. Our solid results off the pitch help contribute to what remains our number one priority \u2013 success on the pitch.\u201d", "tags": ["Manchester United", "Finances", "Football", "Business", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-11T15:25:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/japanese-stock-market-plunges-5-as-global-rout-gathers-pace", "sentences": ["The finance minister, Taro Aso, said G20 would consider cooperating to address currency fluctuations when they meet in Shanghai later this month, but he declined to comment on possible intervention."], "title": "Japanese stock market plunges 5% as global rout gathers pace", "article": "The global stock market rout has continued in Asia Pacific with Japanese stocks plunging nearly 5% as investors continued to dump risky assets amid uncertainty about the stability of the financial system.

It seemed so strange how I ended up in this room, for the recording of If You Are the One \u2013 Australian Special in Nanjing. With audiences of up to 50 million, it\u2019s the biggest dating show in the world.  It started out as a joke. My girlfriends whipped out an iPhone at Balmoral Beach after we had seen the advertisements on SBS2 seeking Mandarin speaking Australian female and male contestants to take part. They recorded a one minute clip of me introducing myself in Mandarin, champagne glass in hand, and sent it off. I thought that was the end of that. Then when I read an email in my junk mail box a month later, inviting me to attend the interview auditions in Sydney, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity for me to practice my Mandarin. The next day I received an email from Jiangsu television studios informing me that I was pre-selected. I took a deep breath and thought to myself, \u201cshit just got real\u201d. The next two weeks I cracked down on my Mandarin, practising daily with my parents. As Shanghainese dialect speakers at home, it was quite an adjustment for them too. The producers were constantly in contact with me requesting further information and data. They wanted answers to questions such as \u201cwhich part of a man\u2019s body do you like the most?\u201d, \u201cwhat qualities are you looking for in a man?\u201d, \u201chow much money do you earn and do you want your partner to earn more than you?\u201d They asked for details of my previous relationships, for photographs of me without make up on, for work certificates. You name it.  The day finally arrives. We arrive at the studio after a three-hour hair and makeup session in a convention centre that has been done up to become the set of If You Are The One. There are wires poking out everywhere, the studio audience have all arrived and my two Australian friends have flown in just to support me. I hug the other contestants backstage. The girls boost each other up emotionally by saying how good we each look, and that we\u2019ll see each other on the other side. We know everything is about to change as soon as we step out there, in front of 50 million viewers in China, not counting the international broadcast.     Feng Guo and Ben McMahon (second from left) with friends on the set of If You Are The One Photograph: Alice Jordan-Baird    Maybe we will find love. Maybe we won\u2019t. We have no idea what is about to happen. The fat director is also sweating. He encourages us to drink wine, and as some of girls do he takes a swig from the bottle. The atmosphere is tense. We can hear the studio audience clap wildly as the infamous host Meng Fei walks on stage. The moment has come. We walk out on stage in pairs, hand in hand, and take our place at the podium. Mine is number 19 and the entire time I\u2019m focusing on not tripping on the slippery ground. We have all been mandated to wear heels. The lights are bright and pressure is intense. There is nowhere to sit and if we want to comment or ask a question, we raise our hands and wait for Meng Fei to address us.  By the time Ben McMahon comes on stage as male contestant number three, I throw out my initial strategy of waiting until at least five of the 10 guys have been on stage. I am thinking to myself, how do I know if they will be any better? The first moment we see the male contestants is when they walk on stage, and we have no prior information about them whatsoever. The thoughts running through my head are, quite frankly, that Ben seems cute, my feet are aching, my makeup is melting, I have run out of vocabulary, I have said everything that I had previously prepared. I need to get off this stage before I make a fool out of myself! And that was it. We matched. I chose him; he chose me. We\u2019re the winners. The extent of our \u201crelationship\u201d to date has been messaging each other. Ben lives in Melbourne, so we haven\u2019t seen each other for 10 weeks. I feel really excited to meet him this weekend, I hope that my memory of him being a funny, intelligent and personable young man serves me right. We only had one date in Shanghai the day after filming and next week we are flying to the Maldives to enjoy the free trip we won together. This seems so bizarre to me \u2013 it is like going on a honeymoon after one date. But then the whole journey has been completely bizarre, from beginning to end. I never thought that at age 26, I would fly to China to be a contestant on the worldwide phenomenon that If You Are The One has become. I never thought that a Chinese director would forbid me from discussing the Chinese Communist party, nor did I think that I would appear on international television in front of twice the population of Australia. I have been reminded of how lucky we are to live in a country that prizes freedom of speech. I didn\u2019t think I would get a free trip out of it, let alone meet a guy who can speak fluent Mandarin after waking up from a coma \u2013 that\u2019s Ben, another bizarre twist in the tale.  But that\u2019s the weird and wonderful thing about taking an impromptu risk.

Sir John Vickers, who led the Independent Commission on Banking, said: \u201cThe Bank of England proposal is less strong than what the ICB recommended.\u201d Vickers, a former Bank of England chief economist, said Threadneedle Street had watered down the proposals put forward by the ICB, leaving it without the necessary financial buffers to continue operating when avenues to fresh funds dried up.   Related: Seven-and-a-half years on, this is a distressingly fragile recovery    The warning came as China\u2019s financial authorities were poised to spend billions of pounds propping up the Shanghai stock market after a week in which fears of a 2008-style banking crash resurfaced. The Shanghai exchange, which will reopen on Monday following a long shutdown for Chinese New Year, will come under pressure from nervous traders amid concerns that a steep fall in stock market values this year is a harbinger of a broader global economic slump. Investors fear that low inflation and the waning power of central banks to generate growth could push the eurozone back into recession and damage several of Europe\u2019s biggest banks. In what appeared to be a coordinated move ahead of the Chinese market\u2019s reopening, the chief of China\u2019s central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, played down concerns over the state of the country\u2019s finances, which he said remained robust and plentiful enough to withstand economic shocks. A senior official at the European Central Bank also issued a statement reassuring investors that Greek banks were secure from the turmoil following their rescue by the ECB last summer. Political unrest in Greece and the possibility of a re-run of last year\u2019s eurozone crisis, when Athens was almost pushed out of the euro, have played a role in destabilising stock and bond markets. Falling oil prices and persistently low inflation have also signalled that the global recovery is petering out. Central banks have responded by cutting interest rates to spur bank lending and growth. Some, including the Swedish and Japanese central banks, have brought in negative interest rates, in effect charging commercial banks to deposit money with them in a desperate attempt to make them lend it to businesses and households. Vickers, who is now the warden of All Souls College, Oxford, told the BBC that more capital is needed, because the nature and scale of the next financial shock is uncertain. \u201cA good way to think about it is as an insurance policy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do have to pay a premium to insure your house and you hope nothing bad will happen. But if it does, you are much better off in paying that premium, and for full coverage. \u201cIf banks run out of capital, all sorts of havoc could ensue. We want to be in a position where there\u2019s enough of a buffer to take any losses that might occur.\u201d He said the Bank of England should rethink its recent announcement about the amount of capital that banks need to hold. Vickers was referring to a recommendation by the ICB that banks should hold a 3% buffer for so-called systemic risks, while, he said, the Bank\u2019s recent proposals were not requiring this.  Earlier, in a comment piece for the Financial Times, he said: \u201cGiven the awfulness of systemic bank failures, ample insurance is need\u00aded, and equity is the best form of insurance. The recent volatility in banks underlines the importance of strong capital buffers. The BoE should think again.\u201d The Bank would not comment on Vickers\u2019 warning, although Martin Taylor, the former Barclays chief executive who sat on the ICB inquiry panel, recently told MPs he was happy with the rules.  Now a policymaker at the Bank, Taylor said: \u201cThere is still a heck of a gap, as you rightly point out, between 13% and the Vickers commission\u2019s 18%, but the Vickers commission was operating on the assumption that there would not be bail-in-able debt, if I can put it that way, which we now have or shall shortly have.\u201d Bank shares have plunged following concerns that they will find it difficult to generate profits while interest rates remain low, or turn further into negative territory.

Though there are times when you have to wonder about some journalists as well, acting up like toddlers who have just fallen off their trike. Take the case of Him, who has scored 32 goals for Real Madrid in 31 matches this season, including a group-stage record 11 in Barcelona Procession Event (the tournament formerly known as Big Cup). He\u2019s the top scorer in the entire history of Uefa\u2019s flagship competition, with 86 goals in 79 appearances, ahead of the likes of Lionel Messi, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Gerd M\u00fcller and Eus\u00e9bio.

[Snaps fingers impatiently under Po\u2019 Cristiano\u2019s nose] Four matches! What\u2019s wrong with you? Pull your finger out! The Fiver, who hears those last two phrases in particular quite a lot, can understand Ronaldo\u2019s exasperation, and why he decided to chip off early from the press conference before tonight\u2019s match between Roma and Real Madrid. \u201cWho else has scored more goals away from home than me since I arrived in Spain?\u201d he fired back at his inquisitor. \u201cName one player who has scored more than me?

Mr Stipulations and his ilk also appear to find Ronaldo\u2019s admission that he isn\u2019t bosom buddies with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, and wasn\u2019t best friends forever with Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand or Paul Scholes while at Manchester United, utterly unconscionable. \u201cOur discussions were limited to \u2018Good morning\u2019 and \u2018Good night\u2019,\u201d he explained of his time at Old Trafford, \u201cbut when we were on the pitch together there was total understanding.

Professional. Adult, even. Though admittedly the Fiver has limited social skills (ie no friends). And to be scrupulously fair to Requirements Chap and his cronies, they\u2019re just judging Ronaldo by their own metric. After all, they\u2019re used to working in an industry where civility rules, colleagues always look out for each other and the micro-society they operate in never, ever, ever descends into a solipsistic frenzy of bitching and backstabbing.

The austerian non-believers, for so long the dominant force in the Paris-based thinktank, are banished to a distant land. Common sense has prevailed. As revolutions go, it has taken a while. Five years ago ago, the priority was public spending cuts. George Osborne was lauded. Then there was muted criticism. Now the austerity delusion, as the economist Paul Krugman called it, is no longer a central tenet of thinking at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation &amp; Development, the club formed to provide advice to 34 wealthy countries.   Related: OECD calls for less austerity and more public investment    Replacing calls for changes to the labour market (wages cuts) and reconfigurations of state provision (welfare cuts) is the belief that global economy lacks demand and only a coordinated effort by the G20 group of countries, taking the opportunity to borrow money at ultra-low interest rates, can bring it back. An increase in demand, which is another way of saying an increase in household and business spending and investment, is needed since it became obvious that the backdoor stimulus orchestrated by central banks has long since run out of steam. In its interim assessment of the global economy, where it has downgraded growth this year and next, the OECD warned that only by acting together could Europe, the US, Asia and South America (there are no African members) drive up growth and with the extra tax receipts drive down debt. The coordination is needed because if one country goes for growth on its own, the extra spending can go on imports without a boost to exports, leading to a balance of payments deficit. The better growth story can also act as a magnet for economic migrants, causing social problems and \u2013 without strong labour market protections \u2013 help foster a low-wage, low-productivity economy. Oops, that\u2019s a reasonably accurate picture of Britain today.   graphic   If all OECD countries adopted roughly the same plan, then all countries could grow without the attendant problems. So it is ironic that Osborne fights to prevent any meaningful efforts at coordination. That\u2019s not to say he would be dismayed if the world economy was growing more robustly. It\u2019s just that his cavalier sensibilities make such agreements an anathema. If the OECD sticks to its guns, next week\u2019s G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai should see enough fireworks to rival Chinese new year.

One figure piqued our interest this morning: 100%. Not the most imaginative number in town, but here\u2019s the thing. Manchester United supporters have been charged \u00a371 to attend tonight\u2019s Big Vase showdown at Midtjylland, where their 800 seats\u2019 sightlines can be fairly described as \u201cshallow\u201d, and that is not a particularly good thing. So not good, in fact, that the away supporters will protest. \u201cWELCOME TO SCAMDINAVIA\u201d, one banner will wittily read and, hey, it\u2019s a fair cop. Midtjylland charged \u00a322 to Southampton fans for a similar privilege (69% discount, stattos), and if you\u2019re wondering how they summoned the bare front for such a decision it\u2019s worth noting that their majority shareholder and stats fanatic is Matthew Benham, the owner of a Brentford side for which no algorithm seems able to hash up a finish anywhere near the Championship top six. \u201cWe are only a small club in a small region of Denmark and this is our cup final so we have to make the most of our opportunity,\u201d said club director Cliff Crown, the last of the Romantics. So why 100%? That\u2019s the percentage of the away allocation that has been sold, and if you didn\u2019t know better you\u2019d wonder whether waving angry flags around once you\u2019re inside is little better than knifing yourself in the back and bemoaning life\u2019s cruel impermanence. The faces of football fandom may change but the DNA won\u2019t \u2013 and that\u2019s enough to make sure clubs see them coming time and again. Perhaps that\u2019s unfair; perhaps United\u2019s fans are simply joining Liverpool\u2019s in giddy reverie of a place in next year\u2019s Big Cup. Both are well short of the top four \u2013 not a problem Tottenham have if they lose to Fiorentina \u2013 and will have grim news for their shareholders if they don\u2019t come top of the pile here. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s description of the Big Vase as a \u201cmini Champions League\u201d seems reasonable enough, especially when you see an outfit like Midtjylland overdressing so gaudily for the job they want, and victory at Augsburg (ticket price: \u00a326; eight fewer previous European campaigns than Midtjylland\u2019s \u2026 errr \u2026 eight) would bring Liverpool a step nearer towards fronting up proudly to the men in suits. According to Klopp, this will be the biggest game in Augsburg\u2019s history; Midtjylland might be able to say the same, too, but they are statistically far less likely to draw any sympathy if they provide a timely shot in the arm for the Premier League juggernaut\u2019s Uefa coefficient.

Players want to be on stage; singers would often rather be on the pitch. Naturally there have been memorable fusions: from John Barnes teaming up with New Order to Serge Pizzorno of Kasabian lobbing David Seaman. But what of those forgotten collaborations when footballers decide they want to dip their toes in the glitzy world of music videos? Some come about because they are fans of the musicians, others are more difficult to explain. And, of course, there has been a mixed bag of good and awful. 1) Alessandro Del Piero in Oasis\u2019s Lord don\u2019t slow me down Can you name the Englishman that helped Italy win the World Cup in 2006? Noel Gallagher, also known as Alessandro Del Piero\u2019s lucky charm. The striker was a fan of Oasis and the two became friends despite Gallagher not being fluent in Italian and Del Piero having only an average command of English, never mind Mancunian. Fame, it appears, has its own language. In the video, a medley to promote a documentary of a world tour, Del Piero\u2019s appearance is fleeting and the video itself has been removed from the internet due to copyright infringement. So you will need to make do with a screenshot and the story of how the older Gallagher won the World Cup.     Alessandro Del Piero with his lucky charm. Photograph: Dailymotion    Before the semi-final against Germany, Gallagher called Del Piero looking for a ticket. The Juventus legend found him one \u2013 next to his wife. He scored in the last minute of extra-time and reckoned Gallagher brought him luck. \u201cI was sat beside his wife,\u201d Gallagher said a few years later. \u201cHis wife reckons he was coming over to blow kisses at her, but what\u2019s actually happened is he\u2019s seen me and his wife happened to be there. He then gets it in his head that I\u2019m his lucky mascot, so he said: \u2018You\u2019ll have to come to the final\u2019. He made me wear the same clothes.\u201d Italy, suffice to say, beat France in the final \u2013 a game remembered more for Zinedine Zidane\u2019s pitiful end than the penalty shootout. Del Piero scored Italy\u2019s third from the spot. Coincidentally Zidane and music have history too: Mogwai soundtracking footage of him in action for Real against Villarreal for Zidane: a 21st century portrait. \u201dMy memories of the World Cup victory will always be tied to Noel,\u201d Del Piero adds in an amusing clip on YouTube where he is is describing what the band meant to him. \u201cWhen I first met them I reacted like a little kid.\u201d Del Piero recalls: \u201cI\u2019d love to swap roles with them and I\u2019m sure Noel wouldn\u2019t mind either.\u201d It was filmed in 2007, which is made obvious when he laughs before saying \u201cThey keep asking \u2018when will you join Manchester City? We will put up the cash so we can afford you.\u2019\u201d 2) Micah Richards and Anton Ferdinand in T2\u2019s Heartbroken; Obafemi Martins and Sean Davis in T2\u2019s Gonna be mine If you blinked at a certain juncture in the mid-noughties you would have missed it but bassline was the next big thing for a brief spell, perhaps almost solely thanks to the backing of footballers. T2, the leading light of a genre positioned somewhere between speeded-up garage and grime, found himself breaking into the mainstream thanks to cameos from well-known players in 2007.            T2\u2019s pioneering bassline joint was Heartbroken, starring a healthy defensive partnership of Micah Richards and Anton Ferdinand chilling out in a bar as the video traces our musical hero through a night that starts and ends in bed. On the back of the video\u2019s cult success it climbed to No2 in the charts in an era when they were still mildly important. A follow up track, Gonna be mine, featuring a pair of singers trying to keep up with a rabid, fireball beat, also saw Obafemi Martins and Sean Davis \u2013 yep, you guessed it \u2013 kicking back in a bar. But how did it all come about? Predictably T2\u2019s people knew some footballers\u2019 people. Tafazwa Tawonezvi, as he is known in real life, was under the umbrella of the management company NVA, who have worked closely with Rio Ferdinand, and the link came from there. Although one tabloid gossip columnist claimed T2 was the sound of dressing rooms across the country and David Beckham had Heartbroken as his ringtone, the same article promised \u201cT2 is set to go big-time on the back of this track\u201d. Not quite. Lately T2 has been seen working with mega stars Rebecca Ferguson and Craig David. As for the footballers: Richards is propping up the Premier League with Aston Villa; Anton Ferdinand is on the bench at mid-table Reading in the Championship; and Davis is retired. Heartbroken indeed. Martins, though, bucks the trend: he will be living it up on megabucks at Shanghai Shenhua after joining from Seattle. 3) Chris Waddle in Arctic Monkeys\u2019 Don\u2019t sit down \u2018cause I\u2019ve moved your chair    Chris Waddle plectrum&#39;s have arrived pic.twitter.com/64JlF3mJ&mdash; Arctic Monkeys (@ArcticMonkeys) March 10, 2012    This is probably the most artistic of the videos picked here: action shots of the former Sheffield Wednesday winger are fused with a psychedelic, colourful blend, soundtracked by a single from arguably the Sheffield band\u2019s most underrated record. Arctic Monkeys\u2019 era-defining early work was chock full of references to their home city, from High Green to Hillsborough, and while that has been swapped for songs about sweets and metaphors, they have not forgotten their roots. The whole band are Wednesday fans, despite false yet persistent rumours that they had grown up supporting United. Pictures from a gig last year showed a Wednesday shirt hanging off Matt Helders\u2019 drum kit. Alex Turner has some custom-made Waddle plectrums. And the guitarist Jamie Cook was rumoured to have once had trials for Wednesday\u2019s academy.            4) Vinnie Jones in Westlife\u2019s Bob Bop Baby Calling this an ill fit would be kind. While Jones made his name flying into tackles, the Irish boyband made theirs for flying without wings. What transpires in their 2002 single (reaching No5 in the UK charts, which was quite modest by their standards) is Jones\u2019s strangest piece of acting \u2013 and that is quite something considering his back catalogue consists of forays into Japanese and Hungarian cinema. After an initial plan for the video was torn up, there is an instant look of the ramshackle and low budget about it all. Jones portrays Duke Vincent (what a clever piece of casting!), who is about to marry a maiden against her wishes. Her father arranges the marriage with the Duke, described as the \u201cvilest man in the kingdom\u201d so he can make a few quid but the band want to save her. They are locked in a dungeon by Jones and must escape to save her. That is all explained on a clip art-like manuscript at the beginning of the video. You don\u2019t need a description of how the most predictable of all stories develops. Curiously Westlife did not even want the song to be released as a single. Despite the questionable results they worked together again that Christmas, Jones singing Sly &amp; the Family Stone\u2019s Dance to the Music on an album of collaborations for charity. 5) Peter Crouch in Peace\u2019s Gen Strange First, an admission of guilt: in a previous life this writer ghosted a column in a now defunct lads\u2019 mag for the Stoke striker and sometimes when the football chat came to a natural end, talk would shift to tunes. Anything with a guitar would pique his ears and it was no surprise to see him celebrating a win over Arsenal last season by crowd surfing at a Kasabian gig in Brixton Academy that night. It went viral and while Crouch admitted things got slightly out of control, he still enjoyed it immensely. There is something nice in this era of untouchable multi-millionaire players, detached from the real world, getting sweaty at the front of a heaving crowd with Joe and Gina Bloggs. His indie (a term that has long lost its original meaning in music) credentials were bolstered further with a cameo in Peace\u2019s Gen Strange last year: starring as a Ray-Ban and tracksuit wearing bully who gets his comeuppance when the band smash up his car and, eh, urinate on one of Crouch\u2019s pals after calling them \u201cfucking emo\u201d. Don\u2019t let that put you off, though \u2013 it\u2019s a belting song from one of last year\u2019s most underrated and fun albums. Plus, how often do you see leather jackets matched with trackie bottoms? The story of how it came about was a tad chaotic, mind. \u201cSomeone pulled out and they asked me like sort of last minute really,\u201d Crouch told NME, subsequently failing to abscond from fooballerspeak. \u201cI was doing nothing that day so it literally ended up being like that. It was a bit of fun to be fair. I like the band you know, I like the lads so decided to just go for it.\u201d         Peter Crouch pretends to be a yob.    6) Lukas Podolski in Brings\u2019 Halleluja Followers of the former Arsenal striker on Instagram, who is now enjoying life at Galatasaray and making sure we know, will see incessant reminders that he is from K\u00f6ln. Pictures of him inside the Rhein Energie Stadion, snaps of the magnificent cathedral and a clothing brand that heavily refers to C*G*N: Podolski is deeply proud of his hometown. It seemed only natural, then, that he would guest on a video for local jaunty band Brings\u2019 video for Halleluja. Brings, still together 25 years after releasing their first record, have enjoyed plenty of domestic success but failed to leave an impact outside of their comfort zone. Much like Podolski, it might be argued, whose major club honours have all come in Germany, apart from Arsenal\u2019s 2014 FA Cup win. The result of their collaboration is a brilliantly awful cocktail of awkward fist pumping, dreadful miming and a bit of bog-standard ball juggling to an overly-happy backing track. The band are famous for singing in the Colognian dialect K\u00f6lsch but there is no need for a translation of the chorus. A warning: you will be singing along to it on your lunch break and absolutely no apologies will be made from this end.         Lukas Podolski does dad dancing and miming.

They are right to: it\u2019s complicated, because when we refer to the City with a capital C, there are two different, overlapping entities involved. The first is the City in the sense of London\u2019s financial centre. This used to be a coherent geographical entity, located in the Square Mile, with St Paul\u2019s more or less at its centre. The Square Mile is still a big deal in the world of banking and finance, but when people talk about the City in this context, they now include the other bits of London that deal with money, among them Canary Wharf (where a number of the big banks are) and Mayfair (where the hedge funders hang out). The City in this broader sense has for centuries been one of the most internationally connected parts of the country. Indeed, that international network was its main asset. Britain had an empire, and the world\u2019s most powerful navy, and as a result an international system of trade and finance, with three main components: importing goods such as sugar, tea and coffee; re-exporting them, often to Europe; and using the closed network of the empire as a favourable market for British manufactured goods. The City was central to all this, a globally unique cluster of expertise and capital. Big bang, near-total deregulation and the City\u2019s consequent opening up to foreign capital by Mrs Thatcher in October 1986 was the culmination of this long-standing theme in British history. It was an event with huge consequences, which turned the power of finance into a monster, looming over the rest of the British economy; but it was also consistent with this old theme of internationalised, globally networked capitalism, with the City of London at its heart.    Looking at Parr's photographs, you might find yourself asking: why are these people dressing up all the time?    I\u2019ll call that City 1. The other thing people are talking about when they refer to the City of London is the body that runs it: the City of London Corporation. Let\u2019s call this City 2. This is the City of these photographs, and a very strange place it is, too. The photographs are part of Martin Parr\u2019s long-term project to study the British establishment. (\u201cI\u2019m currently doing Oxford and I\u2019ve done a couple of public schools,\u201d he tells me). The City series is the first fruit of this longer scheme. It might seem a surprising subject for a man who sees common humanity wherever he looks. Parr is interested in Englishness, and eccentricity, and in people whose preoccupations create a world of their own. \u201cI\u2019m a nosy person,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a photographer.\u201d City 2 is the body that runs the Square Mile. It is, as the corporation\u2019s website tells you, \u201cthe oldest continuous municipal democracy in the world and predates parliament\u201d. That\u2019s predates in the sense of \u201cis older than\u201d, though to many observers the City also has a predatory, antagonistic relationship with the rest of the UK\u2019s body politic. The City has its own form of democracy, one in which the majority of votes are controlled by corporations rather than by individuals. It is both a city and a county; it has its own police force, and owns and develops properties beyond its boundaries. (The City of London runs Hampstead Heath.)     Members of The Company Of Watermen And Lightermen, Lord Mayor\u2019s Show, Guildhall, City of London, 2014. Photograph: \u00a9 Martin Parr/Magnum Photos    City 2 is rich and powerful, immensely so: its budget for this year is \u00a3372m, including a contribution of \u00a32.6m to top up its cash reserves. The City Fund has assets worth \u00a31.05bn, and a separate City\u2019s Cash fund with assets of \u00a31.8bn. (These figures only became public knowledge in 2012, after scrutiny by the Occupy movement.) That\u2019s a lot of money for a council that, at the time of the 2011 census, had only 7,400 actual human residents. But then, human residents aren\u2019t what the City is really about. In his fascinating and horrifying book Treasure Islands, a study of tax havens around the world, Nicholas Shaxson makes clear that the outsider\u2019s bafflement at what the City does is perfectly justified. \u201cYou could read every page on its website for days, and still not find a satisfactory answer to the question, \u2018What is it?\u2019, except that the corporation is the local government of the Square Mile.\u201d Much of the City\u2019s activity is focused on lobbying for its own interests. It even has a permanent official in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords whose job is to make sure that no legislation is passed detrimental to the City\u2019s interests. He has a wonderfully Gothic job title: the Remembrancer. Looking at Parr\u2019s photographs, you might find yourself asking: why are these people dressing up all the time? The answer is that City 2 has an immense amount of ceremony and ritual, most of it completely opaque to outsiders. \u201cI still get confused about who everyone is and how it all works, aldermen and freemen and sheriffs and all that,\u201d Parr says. The Lord Mayor\u2019s Show is the annual climax of this ritual: according to Shaxson, it\u2019s the world\u2019s oldest civic procession, and was the first outside event ever broadcast live on TV. (The City\u2019s Lord Mayor, by the way, is not to be confused with London\u2019s mayor. The current holder of the office is the hereditary peer Lord Mountevans.) But the Lord Mayor\u2019s Show is only the tip of a ceremonial, processional iceberg, as Parr\u2019s photographs show. There are 108 livery companies in the City, all of them with traditions, rituals and costumes of their own. \u201cIt was very white, very middle class,\u201d Parr tells me. \u201cThe liveries are interesting, because they\u2019re very wealthy and they give a lot of money away, yet there\u2019s all this banqueting and feasting. The City is a very modern place and it\u2019s also very feudal.\u201d   Related: 'A tortured heap of towers': the London skyline of tomorrow    Some of the ritual looks incomprehensible and some of it looks lethally dull: quite a few people look deeply bored. And some of it looks fun: \u201cswan upping\u201d, for instance, is the odd-sounding term for the capture and release of swans on the Thames as part of the annual swan census. As the British monarchy explains on its website: \u201cThis historic ceremony dates from the 12th century, when the crown claimed ownership of all mute swans. At that time swans were regarded as a delicious dish at banquets and feasts.\u201d I like the \u201cat that time\u201d, which makes it clear that their majesties have stopped scoffing swans at banquets, while also making it clear that if they wanted to, they legally could, and it would be none of our damned business.     Trial of the Pyx, Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall, 2014 \u2013 where newly minted coins are checked; the Pyx is a chest the coins are carried in. Photograph: \u00a9 Martin Parr/Magnum Photos    This isn\u2019t just a peculiar subculture with no relevance to anything else. To be elected to any role in the corporation, you have to be a freeman of the City, nominated by an alderman, and the livery companies have a big say in all stages of that process. Other countries have versions of City 1, the financial centre \u2013 New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo \u2013 but nobody has anything resembling City 2, the corporation with a 1,000-year history of being a legally separate entity that puts its own interests first. The two Cities overlap. City 2 is, to all intents and purposes, impossible for an outsider to understand, or penetrate. The opacity and complexity are not accidental, and do a lot to serve the interests of City 1, which is, among other things, the world\u2019s leading centre for offshore capital, much of it stolen, much of it hidden from all governments and tax regimes via the use of trust mechanisms.    I didn't realise how powerful the City is until I gave evidence for the Occupy movement    It\u2019s difficult to stress just how opaque, how closed off, this system is. Anyone can prove this for themselves by going anywhere in the Square Mile, standing in front of a building and taking out a camera. Within seconds, a security guard, or guards, will come out and ask you to move on. The requests will rapidly escalate in force. Anyone who\u2019s tried filming in the City will have had the experience of being bounced by bank security. Paul Mason launched into a famous rant in 2014, standing across the road from RBS, about how sick and tired he was after six years of reporting on bank scandals: \u201cIf the banks had the same scrutiny over the traders and their own managers as they have over the camera crews standing outside\u2026 we might not be in this situation.\u201d I must admit that I didn\u2019t realise how powerful and secretive City 2 is until I gave evidence for the Occupy movement during their eviction proceedings at the high court. The Corporation led the legal charge against Occupy, whose response was to draw attention to the extent of City 2\u2019s unaccountable power. Under the heading Democratise the Corporation of the City of London, they listed demands including: \u201cThe city can no longer be tolerated as a state within a state governing above and beyond the authority of parliament. Standing in the tradition of Clement Attlee, we demand: 1. An end to business block votes in all elections. 2. Democratisation of the City\u2019s political institutions. 3. Abolition of the office of Remembrancer in the House of Commons. 4. Abolition of existing secrecy practices within the City, and total and transparent reform of its institutions in order to end corporate tax fraud. 5. The City of London police to be decommissioned and its officers brought under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan police force. 6. Abolition of the office of Lord Mayor of London. 7. A truth and reconciliation commission to examine corruption within the City and its institutions.\u201d None of that has happened, or shows any sign of happening. City 2 won that round. This struggle, however, is not going to go away, not as the gap between the world of finance and the rest of society continues to grow. In the meantime, the City sees no reason to change its ways and will continue on its uniquely closed, uniquely powerful, uniquely unaccountable way. I am a little envious of Martin Parr. The level of access implied in his photographs is one that no writer or journalist will ever \u2013 ever \u2013 get. You should enjoy his pictures, and make the most of the insight they give into this particular piece of British life. You\u2019re never going to get a closer look. \u2022 John Lanchester is the author of the novel Capital, and Whoops!

Related: Football transfer rumours: Wayne Rooney to join Shanghai Shenhua?    Liverpool paid \u00a316m to sign the 25-year-old from Milan in 2014 and he remains under contract at Anfield until 2017, with the club having an option to extend the deal by a year. That is not on the agenda following his minimal contribution under Brendan Rodgers, who ultimately froze out Balotelli from first-team training, and the accepted panic signing continues to cost Liverpool money.

They could make products and offer services worldwide and, especially in the software field, they would make money hand over fist; look at businesses like Microsoft and Oracle in the 1990s. Oil spills, environmental damage, government regulation \u2013 that was something for other sectors. But with the rise of the internet, and companies\u2019 ability to become not just transnational but supranational, active everywhere yet arguing that their responsibilities belong nowhere, attitudes have changed. Apple\u2019s row with the FBI over access to a locked iPhone that belonged to the employer of one of the San Bernardino killers is just the latest example of technology businesses discovering that nothing they now do is without consequences. Apple has been excoriated by presidential candidates, and backed into the tightest of corners by the FBI: the moral case for refusing to hack into a terrorist\u2019s phone is hard to make \u2013 particularly in the US over an Isis-inspired attack during an election year. But it\u2019s not just Apple. Google\u2019s Matt Brittin probably wakes up sweating about his appearance before the Commons public accounts committee, at which he couldn\u2019t remember how much he earned, and the questions about Google\u2019s sweetheart tax deal with HMRC kept coming. More broadly, the EU is considering an antitrust finding against Google for promoting its own products ahead of rivals\u2019 in search results. Facebook has been threatened with fines by the French data commissioner. Twitter is on-again, off-again in Turkey, depending on the mood of the government, which frequently censors its feed. Pakistan banned Google\u2019s YouTube. Uber has made enemies of taxi drivers and even its own drivers in cities around the world as it undercuts the first group, then cuts payments to the latter. Airbnb is under investigation in New York, London and elsewhere over whether its accommodation site breaks short-let laws. Amazon is rebuked by MPs over its revenue-shifting, tax-minimising ways, and by bookshop lovers who have seen it undercut high-street retailers. Spotify (which hails from Sweden) is criticised by fans and players for the tiny amounts musicians get paid when people stream music through it rather than buying a download or \u2013 remember when? \u2013 a CD. And that\u2019s before we get to artificial intelligence, where people fear huge job losses as machines take over more and more complex jobs. Google, again, is at the nexus of that row, with UK company DeepMind (which it bought in 2014) having to try to dampen worries while raising expectations. Technology companies may not create oil spills, but their effects on modern life are suddenly spreading across a gamut of topics \u2013 privacy, tax, regulation, safety, even housing. That\u2019s why the San Bernardino case could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The FBI knows that the publicity from this battle won\u2019t be favourable to Apple, whichever way the courts rule. That worries every other technology company: it\u2019s notable that Google chief executive Sundar Pichai\u2019s tweets on the topic were carefully hedged, while Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella was similarly unwilling to stand foursquare behind Tim Cook (unlike WhatsApp\u2019s Jan Koum and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey). Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg has been completely silent, though his company did issue a supportive statement. Apple, of course, wasn\u2019t looking for a row with the FBI when it improved the encryption on its phones. And that is what will worry tech companies. As their influence on our daily lives grows, the effects of new features become less predictable \u2013 but probably greater. What if the next case involves taxis and short lets used for child trafficking? Or tax avoidance turning out to fund terrorism? Those may sound farfetched, but they\u2019re only a form of Kranzberg\u2019s first law: \u201cTechnology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.\u201d This week, the tech business is learning, to its reputational cost, just what that really means. An old-fashioned fix for the G20 When G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet this week in Shanghai, the failure of low interest rates to stimulate growth in their economies will be top of the agenda. The global economy is faltering and the knee-jerk response is the same today as it has been since 2008: extra monetary stimulus. But when it seems clear that cutting interest rates to zero \u2013 or even below, a move already deployed in Europe and Japan \u2013 has the same catalysing force as a weak decaff cuppa, surely it is time for a rethink. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation &amp; Development will be on hand with an alternative, though it will not sound very modern or innovative: it is recommending G20 nations coordinate an increase in spending to upgrade their infrastructure. Countries with the capacity to borrow should do so, and that includes the UK. According to the OECD, the growth this plan induces will more than offset the cost of borrowing and will expand national incomes sustainably. This embrace of Keynesianism is not before time. Economists outside the central banks have known for some time that flooding the financial system with cheap funds is a recipe for stagnation. It neither breeds confidence nor tackles structural imbalances, especially not the growing inequality that robs people on lower pay of decent wages to spend. George Osborne will fight the OECD, primarily to defend his economically nonsensical pitch to voters that the exchequer will benefit from balancing the books by 2020. Likewise, Germany will oppose the plan because its ageing population wants to conserve cash, not spend it for the benefit of the next generation. Other countries will resist for more practical reasons. China is investing like crazy and needs to continue switching to consumption, though it might be better if it encouraged the consumption of healthcare via taxation than the purchase of high street goods. Which illustrates how political forces defeat economic arguments, even when those arguments make sense for almost every country and could end the reliance on increasingly exhausted central banks. Banks need a nice thick cushion The words \u201csystemic risk buffers\u201d may cause many eyes to glaze over. But they shouldn\u2019t. This is the extra bit of capital cushion that banks should hold, on top of the regulatory minimum, to help protect them against a system-wide meltdown such as we saw in the 2008 crisis. Sir John Vickers, who in 2011 was charged with finding ways of preventing another taxpayer bailout of the banking system, concluded that banks should hold an extra buffer worth 3% of their assets. Five years on, the Bank of England has set the buffer at around 0.5%. The Bank argues that when it is all added together, the amount of capital banks are required to hold is more than the overall total prescribed by Vickers. Even so, Vickers spoke out last week to urge Threadneedle Street to think again. He says these buffers are as important as ever for the safety of the UK banking sector, which remains bigger than the nation\u2019s GDP. He should be given a good hearing.", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Technology", "Apple", "Google", "Facebook", "Microsoft", "Uber", "Investing", "Banking", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-21T07:00:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/feb/21/central-bankers-on-the-defensive-as-weird-policy-becomes-even-weirder", "sentences": ["It will make the case for higher investment spending at this week\u2019s meeting of the G20 in Shanghai, almost certainly to little effect."], "title": "Central bankers on the defensive as weird policy becomes even weirder", "article": "Members of the Treasury select committee get the chance to grill the governor of the Bank of England on Tuesday. Mark Carney will make the short journey from Threadneedle Street to Westminster to face questions on the state of the economy. It should be an intriguing contest. The committee\u2019s chairman, Andrew Tyrie, will treat the governor with the weary disdain of a headteacher ticking off a pupil for a substandard piece of homework. Carney will answer in sentences so long that MPs may feel the need for a drinks\u2019 interval half way through them. Tyrie deserves to be cheered on, because central banks have had it far too cushy for far too long. It is taken as read that the best way to run an economy is to muscle politicians out of the way and let technocrats run things.  When the financial crisis turned nasty in 2008, central banks were at the zenith of their influence and were handed the responsibility for cleaning up the mess. They slashed interest rates and pumped up the money supply through the use of quantitative easing, the process whereby a central bank buys bonds and exchanges them for new electronic money. Economic policy quickly became lopsided. For a brief period, fiscal policy was used to cut taxes and increase public spending but the general approach since the crisis has been for monetary policy to remain ultra loose and for budgets to be kept tight. Governments have relied on low interest rates and QE to generate enough growth to offset the impact of raising taxes and cutting public spending. The strategy prevented a second Great Depression but has not delivered a strong and durable recovery. Interest rates were supposed to stay at emergency levels for only as long as it took to return life to normal. In the UK, these emergency levels have now lasted for longer than it took for the Beatles to record every one of their albums.  There seems not the remotest chance of emergency rates ending any time soon. January 2016 was the month when inflation was supposed to shoot up in the UK, because the big 0.9% monthly drop in prices seen in January 2015 then dropped out of the year-on-year calculation of the cost of living. In fact, there was only a small 0.1 point increase in inflation to 0.3% because the price fall in January 2016 of 0.8% was almost identical to that in January 2016. What\u2019s more, the annual inflation rate will fall over the coming months unless last year\u2019s monthly increases in prices \u2013 of either 0.3% or 0.2% - for each month between February and May are repeated.  It\u2019s the same story everywhere of weird policy becoming even weirder. Seven and a half years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers the US Federal Reserve has tried raising rates and is already regretting it. The City half expects the next move in UK interest rates to be down. Elsewhere interest rates are negative, with commercial banks being penalised for depositing cash with central banks in the hope that they will instead use their funds to lend to the private sector. What started in some of the smaller countries \u2013 Switzerland and Sweden \u2013 has now spread to the big boys. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan now have negative rates. Growth is tepid, productivity is poor, and inflation is too low for comfort. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last week joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in cutting its growth forecasts for 2016. Another recession now would send the global economy spiralling into deflation and put the eurozone under immense, and perhaps terminal, strain. Clearly, all is not quite going according to the masterplan drawn up by central banks. As far as the OECD is concerned, monetary policy is being forced to take too much of the strain. Its chief economist Catherine Mann made the point that lasting recovery required three things: stimulative monetary policy; activist fiscal policy; and structural reform. The OECD wants the second of these ingredients to be added to the recipe in the form of increased spending on public infrastructure, something it says would more than pay for itself at a time when governments can borrow so cheaply.  The Paris-based thinktank says collective action by the world\u2019s leading economies is needed because a go-it-alone approach will result in the effects of stronger demand being blunted by higher imports. It will make the case for higher investment spending at this week\u2019s meeting of the G20 in Shanghai, almost certainly to little effect. Central banks will argue that they still have plenty of ammunition left, even though as the years tick by it becomes more and more apparent that relying solely on monetary policy is the equivalent of pushing on a piece of string. Central banks now have one last chance to live up to their exalted reputations. A prolonged period of low but positive interest rates carries the risk that it will create the conditions for asset price bubbles. That risk is amplified by quantitative easing. All the dangers associated with low but positive borrowing costs apply to negative interest rates \u2013 but with some added complications. One is that it affects the profitability of banks, by squeezing lending spreads, at a time when many of them have yet to make a full recovery from the last crisis. Another is that central banks will overcook things and that the deeper into negative territory interest rates go now the higher they will have to go later. Perhaps though the biggest danger is to the reputation of central banks. Throughout the crisis, the assumption has been that the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and all the other central banks are in control of a tricky situation. Central bankers give the impression that they can model the impact of interest rates and QE on growth and inflation; that is part of their mystique. Now, it may be that it is simply taking time for central banks to get to grips with a protracted and complex crisis. Everything may work out well in the end, with inflation returning to target and interest rates back to more normal levels. The absence of supportive fiscal policy could be making an already tough job that much tougher. But the longer this goes on the more the suspicion grows that central bankers aren\u2019t quite so clever as they think they are, and that what is dressed up as a carefully calibrated policy response is really just blundering around in the dark. Central banks have been conducting a gigantic experiment over the past seven years and Tyrie will want to know from Carney whether he actually knows what he is doing. It is a perfectly fair question.

Evidently, he was won over by discussions about vision and passion.  Del Piero admitted then that he was lured by what he termed \u201cProject Sydney\u201d; a coming together of himself, Sydney FC and Football Federation Australia to grow the game and, of course, his personal brand. A few years on, and serious questions are being asked about the lasting impact this has had.   Related: Melbourne City heap misery on Central Coast after Storm Roux horror injury    Indeed, vision has been the buzzword in Australian football this week, particularly coming from Socceroos star Tim Cahill. Having opted to remain abroad when recently released by Shanghai Shenhua \u2013 a reasonable decision given he was ineligible to play in his homeland this season anyway \u2013 the 36-year-old used the moment to lambast FFA over a lack of long-term strategy. Cahill cited the recruitment of Del Piero, and perceived minimal development since, as a prime example.  Cahill is a leading figure in the game, and is right to demand a master plan from the governing body and A-League clubs. But, as Del Piero\u2019s project showed, vision is one thing, having the energy and resources to carry it out long-term is entirely another. That is the realisation surely now sinking in for Wellington Phoenix. At the end of an historic few days in which the club was finally granted a 10-year licence extension \u2013 something which appeared unimaginable when their application was rejected by FFA last October \u2013 the New Zealand club delivered an incredibly frustrating display on the pitch.  Having twice gone ahead away to Newcastle Jets on Saturday evening, Phoenix squandered an opportunity to celebrate a watershed week with another hard-fought triumph. They instead conceded three sloppy goals, the last of which \u2013 scored by Jets\u2019 hero Morten Nordstrand \u2013 occurred after Watson experienced a brain fade of Mario Balotelli proportions to get sent off for interfering with a free-kick. Wellington\u2019s fifth loss from their past six matches also came on the back of a calamitous failure to gain an international clearance for Birmingham City loanee Alex Jones due to an administrative oversight. These sorts of mistakes may seem trivial when viewed in isolation, but they make achieving larger objectives virtually impossible. It will be improvement in these areas which will mean so much to Wellington\u2019s long-term viability as they aim to realise their own vision. The licence extension itself, though, is cause for great hope for the future, and not just for Phoenix fans. It is vital the A-League as a competition determines its direction, and having certainty over which markets are being targeted is obviously a crucial part of that.  For the club specifically, a blueprint can now be made for the future, much to the relief of coach Ernie Merrick. \u201cIt makes signing players and re-signing players a lot easier knowing the licence is in place and we\u2019re pretty keen to have a very exciting squad next year,\u201d Merrick said following Saturday\u2019s defeat. \u201cThere are some exciting players we\u2019re looking at and talking to.\u201d That the signings he is referring to include New Zealand international and A-League championship winner Kosta Barbarouses is an indication that the bigger picture across the Tasman is starting to become clear.  Barbarouses, meanwhile, was absent from Melbourne Victory\u2019s squad, which went down 1-0 to a red-hot Adelaide United on Friday night. The Reds should now be considered a contender for silverware themselves this season after lifting off the bottom of the ladder to now sit just two points from the pinnacle. Guillermo Amor and his team deserve every accolade they are currently receiving for this remarkable revival. The Victory had not lost at home to their South Australian rivals since 2011, but on this occasion were hit by a late Bruce Kamau goal, subjecting Kevin Muscat\u2019s side to a fourth match without a win. It leaves the Victory, quite astonishingly, equal with sixth-placed Sydney FC on 29 points.  The Sky Blues, for their part, picked up a gritty draw in a tense derby against Western Sydney Wanderers. The result stretches the Wanderers\u2019 streak without a victory against their nearest rivals to seven matches, but it does little to boost confidence within Graham Arnold\u2019s camp either. Sydney are coming under increasing pressure after a shaky January transfer window while enduring a five-match winless run. In contrast, Perth Glory look anything but unstable at the moment after taking out a record-equalling nine-goal thriller against Brisbane Roar 6-3. Now on an Adelaide-like run themselves, Glory appear a genuine threat to the likes of Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory when it comes to a finals berth. If their strike force of Andy Keogh and Chris Harold can continue to feed off the talents of mercurial playmaker Diego Castro, anything is possible. Though both sides at the top of the table slipped up this week, Brisbane will still have a chance to pull clear if they can halt the Reds\u2019 juggernaut at Coopers Stadium next Saturday. John Aloisi will, however, need to remind his players of the fundamentals which brought them such success early in the campaign, but which have eluded them a little in recent weeks.

Intriguingly, Cahill said he put pen to paper on just a five-month deal, meaning he would be available to start the new A-League season in October, should clubs be willing to bring him to Australia and be able to meet his demands. There would also have to be a degree of reconciliation between the player and FFA if any such move were to go ahead.

The highs tend to be very high and the lows are usually, well, some sort of pithy comment about the Mariana Trench, and then there are things like this that you\u2019d hope for their sake to be a mean prank emanating from the other end of Seven Sisters Road but deep down know to be the work of people with Jeremy Usborne levels of delusion. They\u2019re an excitable bunch, that\u2019s for certain, and there\u2019s nothing more exciting than a visit from football\u2019s last bastion of purity, Qatar Airways\u2019 very own \u201cBar\u00e7a\u201d. \u201cWhy not win this game?\u201d pouted Olivier Giroud, inadvertently providing the inspiration for a forthcoming episode of Pointless. In general, though, caution has been the buzzword \u2013 understandable given that this, with the heroic late show against 10-man Leicester followed by that frustrating blank against Hull \u2018B\u2019, has been that most Arsenalish of weeks. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger himself admits that he is \u201cmore concerned about stopping them scoring\u201d in the first leg and that Arsenal, who tend to have much less trouble rousing themselves for matches of this kind than visits from their perceived inferiors, will be required to \u201craise the urgency level\u201d. The task, against a team that has not been beaten in 32 games, seems thankless ... and yet. Football fandom might not quite have jumped the shark back in 2011 but bars have been spitted over less than Arsenal\u2019s last meeting with footballing sainthood. That night, an XI featuring Johan Djourou, Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 and Alex Song had strained every sinew to restrict Guardiola-era Barcelona to a solitary goal before the cavalry arrived in the indomitable forms of Nicklas Bendtner and eventual matchwinner Andrey Arshavin. Never mind that Bendtner fluffed his lines in a one-sided rematch. It would, on several levels, be deeply unfair to flick through the current Arsenal squad and ask who might be this year\u2019s Arshavin. Joel Campbell might be a candidate if he hadn\u2019t done a decent job of covering his full-back last time out; there\u2019d be a shout for Theo Walcott but you sense he actually quite enjoys football. Alexis S\u00e1nchez \u2013 \u201cLuis Su\u00e1rez Lite\u201d, as he\u2019s fondly known in Catalonia \u2013 is probably the most likely to provide inspiration for new rhyming exploits but Wenger has suggested that being fired up for the occasion \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean he will be in the right zone\u201d. Calmness, equanimity and good sense, then, are the order of the evening \u2013 along with a nice, healthy dose of realism. If The Fiver had to make a prediction, it would go thus: ecstatic-and-in-no-way-premature rap battles up and down the Holloway Road at 10pm, followed by another long, pitch-black night of the soul at Camp Nou three weeks from now. Neither of which would solve our opening conundrum.

FIVER LETTARRGGHHHHHS! \u201cI hate to do this, but \u2026 Ben Jones\u2019s \u2018an infamous smuggling route in less (fewer!) than 12 parsecs\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) was just asking for trouble. Fewer is considered wrong by the pedant community in this case because parsec is a subdividable unit and fewer is typically considered to apply to quantities that are not subdividable such as items in a shopping basket. If the question of indivisibility of this example arises, I should think The Fiver is well aware of how narky they get if you try to subdivide a four-pack of Purple Tin in order to ensure the correct balance between economy and oblivion is maintained, and can vouch for me on this one. Calls himself a pedant and he can\u2019t even get the first question on the pedantry entrance exam correct. Tchuh\u201d \u2013 Louise Wright.  \u201cA couple of questions for Ben on his attempt to quell confusion regarding a certain Star Wars kerfuffle. If the Kessel Run is a route as he states in his email, then the starships being judged on the route they take is a nonsense, as they\u2019d all take the same route (the Kessel Run) and presumably either take the same amount of time too, or one could be faster than the other and you\u2019d measure that time in something other than parsecs. I will let him off with that though, and move on with what seems like the more pertinent point. The whole parsecs thing was clearly a mistake George Lucas made which was then cleared up with some handy retconning in either the next film or one of the expanded universe novels as were, which makes it seem pretty fair game for this sort of gaffe hunting. Also, and I\u2019m aware I\u2019ve added to the problem, this email thread is tired even for The Fiver\u2019s letters page\u201d \u2013 Robbie Georgeson. \u201cIf the hyper drive was responsible for the calculations that resulted in the Kessel Run covering a distance of 12 parsecs (a measly 228 trillion miles), then why does Han Solo boast about it as if it was his own personal achievement? It\u2019s not like he built the Millennium Falcon and its hyper drive personally \u2013 we all know he won it from Lando Calrissian in a card game.

For a moment neither knew what to do. So many things Chen Yue had to say to Richard Smith yet no words came out. What do you tell the man who handed you a dream and never realized what he had done? Chen Yue tried. She wanted Smith to know he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s here. She wanted to say that when he chose her from a group of 80 boys for a basketball team in Beijing seven years ago it was the instant she thought she could be special, that she believed. And that this belief ignited a hope that brought her to the University of California where she is the first woman from her country to play college basketball in the US. But Chen Yue\u2019s English wasn\u2019t strong enough for her to say these things. She couldn\u2019t express the thoughts that swirled around her head in a mash of Mandarin and English. Instead she walked up to Smith, the director of basketball operations for the Utah Jazz and swallowed him in a hug. And all she said was this: \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you again.\u201d   Related: Tennessee's 31-year run in women's basketball poll comes to an end    An NBA producer would eventually tell Smith the story of he and Chen is like the movie The Blind Side. Only in this instance Smith was not a parent taking in a football player but a basketball scout picking a team of children in Beijing and moved to choose a then-6ft 1in girl because she worked hard and he wanted to give her confidence. \u201cShe hustled, I thought she should be rewarded for that,\u201d Smith later said. He never imagined the compulsive act of selecting a girl over a boy would inspire her to push until she found a way to do something no Chinese woman had done before. He never thought a random selection at a youth basketball camp would someday bring Chen Yue close to tears when she said: \u201cRichard Smith starts my dream.\u201d He was just a guy from an NBA team halfway around the world trying to do what was right. Then he wound up changing a life. ***  Until Richard Smith showed up at Cal\u2019s team hotel in Salt Lake City the night before they played the University of Utah, Cal\u2019s players had little idea how Chen Yue became their teammate. It was a story the Cal coaches hadn\u2019t heard themselves until Smith explained it in an email to the basketball staff in early December.     Chen Yue and Richard Smith were reunited last week in Salt Lake City. Photograph: UC Berkeley    And so in the lobby of the hotel, he told them how Chen, who grew up the daughter of basketball players in China and grew to love the game too, signed up for a basketball clinic called Junior NBA in the summer of 2009 because it sounded like sounded fun. Then after a couple days at the clinic she was picked for an advanced clinic with 78 boys and two girls and how the coach of this clinic was Smith. He noticed Chen immediately in the advanced camp. She was the tallest player there \u2013 already able to use her size to stand before the basket, holding her arms high and deflect opponents\u2019 shots. But what he liked most was how she fought through the scrimmages he held, trying desperately to beat the boys. And when the camp was done and he had to pick a 10-player team to compete against other Junior NBA teams in Shanghai and Guangzhou, he chose her over more talented boys. He did this not just because he needed height on his team and she was tall, though these were definitely reasons, but also because he didn\u2019t want her to feel awkward or geeky. She had \u201cput a lot on the line to fit in with the boys\u201d and he thought there should be a reward for such effort. And when her name was called and she walked to the front of the room and stood before the boys, he is sure she shot him a look that seemed to say: Thank you for understanding how hard I tried. Smith told the Cal players that team travelled to Shanghai and Guangzhou and beat both those Junior NBA teams and was given a trip to Dallas for the NBA All-Star Game where the kids from Beijing had a private practice with Dwight Howard. Then afterward Smith gave the Beijing team his Utah Jazz business card and encouraged them to write, which a few did until eventually there was silence. Until 2014 when a new email appeared in his mailbox. \u201cI am Chenyue. How are you now, I miss you so much. Do you still remember me? The girl who attending \u2018teenager NBA\u2019 in 2009 with you. Thanks for cultivating me...\u201d Chen told him in the letter that she wanted to come to the US to play college basketball but she didn\u2019t know how. Could he help? And Smith described how he forwarded the letter to Greg Stolt and William Wu of the NBA\u2019s China office and that the two men visited Chen and her parents and explained the system of recruiting along with the procedures for applying to college. Eventually, he said, a friend of Chen\u2019s father had produced a highlight tape and gave it to a scouting service that Cal assistant coach Charmin Smith saw and eventually Chen came to Cal. Only Richard Smith had not known what had happened to Chen after her email asking for help. She had tried to send him updates only to have the emails returned with error messages. He had no idea what had become of the girl he picked for the team in Beijing until this past fall when he was looking at the website for Cal\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team and for reasons he still can\u2019t explain, he clicked the tab for the women\u2019s team. A roster appeared. The bottom name practically screamed off the screen. \u201cChen Yue.\u201d He looked again just to be sure. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d he said that day. When he was done with Chen\u2019s story, he pulled out a photo of that long ago team with the tall girl standing beside nine shorter boys. Imagine what it took for her to get to Cal, he told them. \u201cPut yourself in her position,\u201d he said. The Cal players nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t told them that story,\u201d Chen later said. \u201cHe showed them my past life and shared with them about me. If I told that story to my teammates they wouldn\u2019t get the idea of it. But he can tell it in a lot of detail. Now they are showing a lot of interest. They love seeing the pictures. \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate it has worked out this way,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate to have him in my life.\u201d *** Two weeks before the Salt Lake City meeting, the girl Richard Smith picked to be on his boys\u2019 team in China sat in Cal\u2019s women\u2019s basketball office in Berkeley, California and described to the Guardian her new American life. Her words came slow and then in torrents. The more she went on the more excited she became. She wants to play in the WNBA someday and then she wants to work in corporate marketing. She has perfect grades at one of the country\u2019s top public universities, has asked about doing an internship in the athletic department and helped to plan the team\u2019s Chinese Heritage Night against Stanford. As an adult, Chen Yue (pronounced chen-you-uh) is a friendly, bubbly woman who hides her tenacious determination behind an almost girlish innocence. Richard Smith might have made her believe she could be a basketball player but she spent the next seven years pushing though an unknown to make it happen. She alternately explained how she found her way to Cal and apologized for not having a strong enough English to describe her path. She could talk seriously about her 4.0 grade point average at one moment then cover her mouth with giant fingers at another after saying something silly.     Chen Yue has found a second home abroad. Photograph: UC Berkeley    She pointed to a walking boot on her foot and said a small fracture cut short her freshman season only a few games after it started. She will take a redshirt year to get more rugged and acclimate to her teammates. She smiled and said she can already feel a difference in her strength. She sounded happy to be at Cal and happy to have a year to adjust. The thing Cal coach Lindsay Gottlieb has noticed most about Chen is how she stands up straight, as if she relishes being 6ft 7in. Often tall women will cower, trying to shave a few inches off the thing that makes them stand out the most. She is comfortable with who she is. People follow her around campus. They ask to take pictures with the tallest woman they have ever seen. She says yes and smiles into the cameras with a joy that makes Gottlieb shake her head. There are so many reasons Chen should be lost in this far-off place. But rather she\u2019s made it her own. \u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 thing where coaches say they learn more from player than they teach them but with Chen I sort of feel that every day,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cEvery day she sort of lends perspective to me. She\u2019s 5,000 to 6,000 miles from home, she\u2019s taking on a difficult life changing experience and she does it with such good nature that is really inspiring to me.\u201d This is a young Cal team, mostly freshmen and sophomores rebuilding from a Final Four appearance two years ago. Gottlieb has been harder on them than some of her other teams. One day she asked Chen if her yelling bothered her. Chen laughed. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cThey hit us in China.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m like \u2018WHAT?\u2019\u201d Gottlieb recalled. \u201cSo then I start asking questions and I realize: gosh, we have such a Euro-centric perspective on everything. We all live in our own little world. Then you ask questions about her family life. China is so different with the one-child policy and the difference between males and females and all of a sudden you\u2019re learning about someone\u2019s upbringing that\u2019s so different than your own.\u201d As she talked Gottlieb was suddenly struck by a thought. \u201cYou have this guy say: \u2018I\u2019m going to give you a shot at life\u2019 and now she\u2019s going to take advantage of those opportunities,\u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cShe\u2019s not an ordinary young woman. She\u2019s going to do extraordinary things.\u201d ***  But there was something Smith didn\u2019t tell the Cal players. Something he hasn\u2019t told anyone. There is another reason he picked Chen for the team in China and it wasn\u2019t just because she was tall and worked hard and deserved a chance. From 1997 to 2002 he had been an assistant coach with the Jazz WNBA team, the Utah Starzz, and those years had opened him to a new game. He loved working with the women. They were more diligent than the men. They listened. They cared about working as a team.  Among his favorite of the Starzz players was their center, Margo Dydek, who at 7ft 2in was the tallest female professional in the world. Though she towered over everybody she was never shy about her height. She had a kindness that Smith enjoyed and a curiosity about everything. She was from Poland and had travelled the world. She was smart. She knew things. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any prejudices or biases to any types of people or kind of people,\u201d Smith later said. \u201cShe was terrific.\u201d      After playing several games this season, Chen Yue will take a redshirt year to help acclimate to her new life. Photograph: Peter Fukumae/UC Berkeley    Did his experience working with Dydek, who died of a heart attack in 2011, affect his decision to pick Chen for the team in China? Smith suspects it might. He wonders if those years around Dydek and the other women\u2019s players compelled him to look out for an extra-tall girl fighting hard to prove herself in a camp of boys.  \u201cBut my role is small in Chen\u2019s story,\u201d Smith quickly added. \u201cTo me the story is her desire to better herself and get an education in the United States and how she took that chance and did something with it to get herself here.\u201d Two weeks before, in the basketball office in Berkeley, Chen Yue dabbed her eyes with enormous fingers. Her voice caught. For a moment no words came out. \u201cWithout him maybe I don\u2019t want to come to America,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I want to stay home and finish my basketball career that\u2019s all. Also that time is my first time coming to America.\u201d She batted away a tear. \u201cI want to tell him all my experiences after him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s just too much words and it\u2019s just like nothing I can say.\u201d What do you tell the man who gave you a life and never knew what he had done?

It\u2019s less about Little Britain or Brussels bureaucrats than curious haircuts and cravats. Tory London mayor candidate Zac Goldsmith does not conform to that disabling stereotype, being always attired with subtle elegance and only sometimes doing his listening with one hand jammed into a jacket side pocket, that timeless patrician giveaway. But his decision to campaign for Brexit plants him on the same stage as the sort of person who sports unionist cuff links and wears vanity hats. His Labour rival Sadiq Khan smells an opportunity. On Tuesday, Khan appeared on Newsnight. He has his own sartorial act nicely worked out - dark suit, white shirt, no tie, crisp but nothing flash - and a mission to depict Goldsmith as a cossetted dilettante eccentric. This has been happening for some time, but Khan sees the EU referendum as handing him a bit more ammunition. Asked if he could sit comfortably next to the Barclays CEO on a trade delegation to Shanghai, he said of course he could. And: \u201cBy the way, I will join the Conservative chancellor when it\u2019s in the interests of London and I will join a Conservative prime minister to argue for staying in the European union.\u201d It was the latest example of Khan aligning himself with London\u2019s business interests, and not the first time he\u2019s contrasted in the process his pro-EU stance with Goldsmith\u2019s long-standing Euroscepticism. Not the first time, either, he\u2019s said he\u2019d chum up with the PM on the Remain train. He did all that earlier this month when speaking to members of influential membership group London First at the West End offices of property consultants CBRE. He did it again on Saturday in the homelier surroundings of Ilford North Labour HQ.  \u201cI want to be the most pro-business mayor we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he told me, in case I hadn\u2019t heard him the first 500 times. Then he waved the 28-nation flag. \u201cThere are 500,000 jobs in London directly dependent on European Union membership,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 60% of global companies from the Middle East, from America, have their European headquarters in London.\u201d And then: \u201cSo I\u2019ll be campaigning with David Cameron, with George Osborne to stay in the European Union. And I look forward to campaigning with Zac Goldsmith as well, if he genuinely wants to be a pro-business mayor of London...\u201d  Ah, mischief. That was at just after 2:30 pm. The following morning, Goldsmith officially joined forces with Grayling, Galloway, Gove and the Great British confection known as \u201cBoris\u201d in the battle to bid Europe farewell.  What difference might the two front-runners\u2019 opposed positions on this issue make to the mayoral race? George Eaton at New Statesman and John McTernan at the Telegraph think it ought to help Khan: Londoners, after all, are strongly pro-Europe and more so than the rest of England. Martin Hoscik at Mayorwatch is not so sure. Quite how close the PM allows Khan to get to him remains to be seen, but he may now find it a little harder to get behind Goldsmith. The Tory candidate has made much of being able to do business with Cameron on London\u2019s behalf but, olive branch notwithstanding, look what EuroDave did to BoGo. The mayoral vote will be on 5 May, seven weeks before the referendum. Perhaps the chief value to Khan of Goldsmith lining up with Leave and co will be indirect. He\u2019ll be hoping it helps him in his drive to colonise the London mainstream and squeeze Goldsmith out to the margins.

Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged.  The authors looked at past climate change events and model simulations of the future. They found a clear, strong relationship between the total amount of carbon pollution humans emit, and how far global sea levels will rise. The issue is that ice sheets melt quite slowly, but because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a long time, the eventual melting and associated sea level rise are effectively locked in. As a result, the study authors found that due to the carbon pollution humans have emitted so far, we\u2019ve committed the planet to an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters (5.5 feet). If we manage to stay within the 1 trillion ton carbon budget, which we hope will keep the planet below 2\u00b0C warming above pre-industrial levels, sea levels will nevertheless rise a total of about 9 meters (30 feet). If we continue on a fossil fuel-heavy path, we could trigger a staggering eventual 50 meters (165 feet) of sea level rise. Predicting how quickly sea levels will rise is a challenge. However, two other studies just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the Antarctic ice sheet could melt more quickly than previously thought, and thus contribute to relatively rapid sea level rise. Over the past century, global sea level has risen faster than at any time in the past two millennia, and most of the recent sea level rise is due to human-caused global warming. Several feet of sea level rise this century is likely, with a possibility of 5 feet or more.     Sea level change during each of the twenty centuries of the Common Era. Illustration: Climate Central, based on Kopp et al. (2016), published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.    The Nature Climate Change study didn\u2019t just look at sea level rise; it also looked at global temperature changes. Earth\u2019s sharpest climate changes over the past half million years have occurred when the planet transitions from a \u2018glacial\u2019 to \u2018interglacial\u2019 period, and vice-versa.  Right now we\u2019re in a warm interglacial period, having come out of the last ice age (when New York City and Chicago were under an ice sheet) about 12,000 years ago. During that transition, the Earth\u2019s average surface temperature warmed about 4\u00b0C, but that temperature rise occurred over a period of about 10,000 years. In contrast, humans have caused nearly 1\u00b0C warming over the past 150 years, and we could trigger anywhere from another 1 to 4\u00b0C warming over the next 85 years, depending on how much more carbon we pump into the atmosphere.     Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (top) and average global surface temperature (bottom) from the past 20,000 years to the next 10,000 years in various emissions scenarios. Illustration: Clark et al. (2016), Nature Climate Change.    What humans are in the process of doing to the climate makes the transition out of the last ice age look like a casual stroll through the park. We\u2019re already warming the Earth about 20 times faster than during the ice age transition, and over the next century that rate could increase to 50 times faster or more. We\u2019re in the process of destabilizing the global climate far more quickly than happens even in some of the most severe natural climate change events. That rapid climate destabilization is what has climate scientists worried. It\u2019s faster than many species can adapt to, and could therefore cause widespread extinctions, among other dangerous climate change consequences. Coastal flooding in places like Florida has already become much more common than it was just 50 years ago, and sea level rise is expected to keep accelerating. As Aaron Goldner, one of the Nature Climate Change study authors told me, the next 10\u201320 years are critical in determining which path we follow. There\u2019s a big difference between an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters and one of 9 meters. The sooner we transition away from fossil fuels and cut our carbon pollution, the better we\u2019ll be able to limit the climate destabilization and associated damages.

In a mission statement drafted ahead of the G20 meeting in China later this week, it said that the power of monetary policy was beginning to wane and it was incumbent on those governments that could safely increase their spending to act together to boost global growth.

IMF officials said the Treasury had done enough to stabilise the government\u2019s finances for it to embark on extra investment spending should GDP growth, which has slowed since last year, continue to falter. The Treasury declined to comment on the IMF report. The report said: \u201cFlexibility in the fiscal framework should be used to modify the pace of adjustment in the event of weaker demand growth.\u201d The warning follows an even tougher message from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) last week, which called on the UK to ease up on austerity and join a collective effort by the G20 to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth. The Paris-based thinktank, which counts 34 of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries as members, said the G20 needed to recognise that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery. The OECD\u2019s chief economist, Catherine Mann, said: \u201cWith governments in many countries currently able to borrow for long periods at very low interest rates, there is room for fiscal expansion to strengthen demand in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability.\u201d The IMF echoed the OECD\u2019s call for a coordinated spending plan by rich nations to reverse a downturn in growth since last summer. It avoided singling out individual countries that should increase their spending, but officials warned that slowing global growth needed a different response from policymakers.   Related: OECD's calls for less austerity means common sense has prevailed    The G20 was formed to accommodate the views of rich and developing world economies in the aftermath of the 2008 crash. Members include the US, the UK, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico and Russia.  Tumbling oil prices and a dramatic slowing of the Chinese economy have spooked markets, which have slumped since last year. Fears that China, in a bid to increase its exports, is planning to devalue its currency have further undermined confidence in the ability of policymakers in the west to keep the recovery from the 2008 financial crash on track. The US economy has joined the slide in economic activity in recent months, triggering further concerns that global trade, which has already tumbled over the last 18 months, has further to fall. The IMF said the current low interest rates and trillions of dollars of quantitative easing provided by central banks should remain in place, but more action was needed from governments to prevent a bigger drop in global growth this year and next. \u201cA comprehensive approach is needed to reduce over-reliance on monetary policy,\u201d it said. \u201cIn particular, near-term fiscal policy should be more supportive where appropriate and provided there is fiscal space, especially through investment that boosts both the demand and the supply potential of the economy.\u201d IMF officials, concerned that without coordination some countries will boost spending only to suffer a rise in imports and a collapse in their currency, have concluded that the G20 needs to agree a plan of action that involves all members.

The study by academics at UCL\u2019s Institute of Education found that 15-year-olds educated at private and state schools in London were about six months behind their counterparts in east Asia and wealthy parts of north America and Europe, and doing no better than pupils of the same age in Belfast and south-west Wales. The research used data taken from tests administered through the OECD\u2019s programme for international student assessment (Pisa), and compared the performance of more than 1,000 pupils across 42 London schools with their peers in individual cities and regions around the world. \u201cEducational achievement in London remains some way behind that observed in other leading economies. Further progress is therefore needed if London is to produce the global talent needed to keep its economy competing upon the world stage,\u201d the researchers concluded. London pupils were \u201cconsistently outperformed\u201d by pupils in Hong Kong, Maastricht, Helsinki, Milan, the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria, the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and the US states of Massachusetts and Connecticut.   Related: UK students stuck in educational doldrums, OECD study finds    Pupils in Riga, the Latvian capital, did better than Londoners in both maths and reading tests, while pupils in Moscow and the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, did better in maths than those in the UK capital.

The results come as a surprise given London\u2019s strong performance in examinations such as GCSEs and A-levels, in which London pupils generally outperform their peers in other parts of England, especially in key subjects such as English and maths. John Jerrim, the lead author, said that London\u2019s schools had been \u201crightly lauded\u201d for their improvement in recent years, particularly in results among pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cHowever, London\u2019s comparatively poor Pisa results seem to stem from certain groups performing worse than expected, including girls, ethnic minorities and young people from lower socio-economic groups,\u201d Jerrim said. \u201cThis is especially surprising as these groups end up doing much better on their GCSEs just six months after the international assessments.\u201d In breaking down the data, the authors found that girls in London performed poorly in the 2009 and 2012 Pisa tests, producing an average score well below those of boys. That is in contrast to recent GCSE maths results, where boys perform only a little better than girls. The academics compared the GCSE results of state school pupils in London to try and explain the relative poor performance in the Pisa tests. They found no evidence that students in London put less effort into taking the OECD\u2019s tests than their GCSE results. \u201cIt is important to remember that this is just one assessment, and is a single piece in a much bigger jigsaw. London\u2019s success in GCSE examinations is still a cause for celebration, though clearly much more also needs to be done to ensure children in our capital city are able to compete with the best in the world,\u201d Jerrim said.

Amid continued speculation that China could be forced to devalue the yuan this year, Zhu Guangyao, China\u2019s vice finance minister, said Beijing would seek to keep the exchange rate stable while maintaining its current \u201cmanaged float\u201d regime.  \u201cWe do recognise the risk the global economy faces,\u201d he said at a conference on Thursday held by the Institute of International Finance linked to the G20 summit.  \u201cWe also understand how important it is to correctly communicate with the market,\u201d he added.       The Shanghai meeting is already being compared with the G20 meeting in April 2009 when officials agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression during the global financial crisis. However, few expect this year\u2019s conference to produce similar results. \u201cCalls for co-ordinated policy easing ahead of this weekend\u2019s G20 meeting will almost certainly come to nothing,\u201d wrote Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics in London. China, however, appears to be positioning itself for aggressive fiscal stimulus, hoping it can migrate its economy away from overdependence on low-end export manufacturing to something more sophisticated without setting off a wave of layoffs. Zhu also said that China had room to increase its fiscal deficit this year and would take necessary measures to deal with systemic risks while communicating with the market. According to Bloomberg, he also said that the more fiscal stimulus was needed to kickstart flagging growth in the world economy. \u201cCountries with room to make fiscal expansion should take action,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cWe cannot just rely on monetary policy. Fiscal policy must play a role.\u201d Such increases would have to be approved by Premier Li Keqiang at the annual meeting of parliament which begins March 5, he said.  Zhu\u2019s comments followed similar remarks earlier in the day at the same conference by the head of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Jiang Jianqing, who said there was no market basis for further yuan weakness.  However, similar calls in the past have had little impact in fending off bearish pressure against the currency, with international investors such as George Soros publicly arguing that the currency is set to decline further.   US treasury secretary Jack Lew, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, said China had to make it clear that there was no \u201cmajor devaluation\u201d in the pipeline.  The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) conducted a surprise one-off devaluation of the official guidance rate in August, which it argued would allow the market to reset at its natural level, but investors have continued to move out of the currency since and the exchange rate has slid further.  In a speech at the Shanghai conference, central bank vice governor Yi Gang said that investors could expect more fluctuations by the yuan against the dollar as the PBOC tried to put more emphasis on measuring the yuan\u2019s value against a basket of currencies. The equity markets remained under pressure on Thursday with a fall in the oil price refocusing attention on the weakness of the global economy. The Shanghai Composite index closed down 6.41% while the CSI300 index of leading Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was down 6.14%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong finished down 1.65%.

This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d The Bank of Japan recently joined the European Central Bank, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December to calm what it thought was a strongly growing US economy, but a string of poor economic figures since then has put pressure on Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, to reverse the policy at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in March. Carney has hinted that he is prepared to cut the base rate from 0.5%, but has ruled out following the trend for negative rates, saying it would damage the stability of UK banks and building societies. William White, a former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the central bankers\u2019 club, who now chairs the OECD\u2019s review committee, warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d ahead of the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos last month.   Related: IMF urges G20 to take 'bold action' on global economy    Amid steep falls in stock markets that some economists said were a sign of panic among global investors at the worsening economic outlook, he said: \u201cThe situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up.  \u201cDebts have continued to build up over the past eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief.\u201d The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash.  Carney, who is also head of the G20 financial stability board, said the banking system remained strong despite the recent downturn and could withstand shocks from volatile markets.  He added that central banks still had a role to play to boost lending and confidence among businesses and consumers, but politicians should not rely on cuts in interest rates and quantitative easing to turn around an \u201cunforgiving\u201d global economy. He accused G20 governments, which include the UK, US, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India and Indonesia, of failing to keep their side of a bargain that meant ending trade protections and enacting financial reforms to boost growth. \u201cAt the Brisbane summit in 2014, the G20 leaders agreed an ambitious goal to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. But only 18 months on, the two in five commitments are starting to look more like the 5/2 diet.  \u201cLess than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered. Moreover, whilst implementation has lagged, the need to boost growth has increased in size and urgency.\u201d He said the Bank of England expects the level of global GDP in 2018 to be more than 3% below what the IMF expected at the time of the Brisbane summit.  \u201cWe need to live up to China\u2019s G20 priorities: structural reforms with a long-term focus but a short-term implementation horizon, determined reform of the global architecture for sustainable capital flows and the development of our essential macroprudential frameworks and the implementation of our financial reform commitments to address new vulnerabilities.\u201d", "tags": ["Global economy", "Mark Carney", "Bank of England", "Interest rates", "Federal Reserve", "G20", "European Central Bank", "Business", "Economics", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-26T00:05:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/26/former-tory-leader-michael-howard-call-uk-leave-eu", "sentences": ["Finance ministers are meeting in Shanghai on Friday and the chancellor is expected to press for the G20 to signal its concerns about a possible Brexit."], "title": "Former Tory leader Michael Howard becomes latest to call for UK to leave EU", "article": "Former Conservative leader Michael Howard has become the latest high-profile Tory to call for Britain to leave the European Union.

We will have a sensible agreement with the EU which would give their countries access to our market and would give us access to theirs.\u201d To the surprise of listeners, Sarah Montague, the Today presenter, asked Howard if David Cameron would be calling him a \u201cbastard\u201d, the word that Sir John Major used to refer to Eurosceptic members of his cabinet in 1993. The former prime minister was reportedly referring to Howard, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo at the time. \u201cThat has always been in doubt actually as to whether I was one of them but perhaps that is not an issue we want to go into this morning,\u201d Howard said of Major\u2019s remarks. Asked whether Cameron would use similar language, Howard said: \u201cThat is something you\u2019d have to ask him about.\u201d Howard, who came out in favour of Brexit in an article in the Daily Telegraph, described the EU as an outdated model. \u201cIt tries to impose a rigid straitjacket of uniformity on countries as different as Finland and Greece. That is why it is a flawed and failing project.\u201d   Related: David Cameron warns Brexit could cost jobs and force up prices    In a blow to the prime minister, who worked for Howard during his time as home secretary in the mid 1990s, the former Tory leader questioned Cameron\u2019s claim that a second referendum after a no vote was \u201cfor the birds\u201d.  The prime minister has dismissed the idea of a second referendum, which Boris Johnson has supported as a way of renegotiating new terms, by saying he would begin exit negotiations immediately after a vote to leave. Cameron could act on 24 June, the day after the referendum, by triggering the exit mechanism in article 50 of the Lisbon treaty at an EU summit in Brussels. Howard called for a pause of about a month after a vote to leave to allow the EU to reconsider the current deal. \u201cIt is quite likely that during that month they would say let\u2019s talk some more, let\u2019s see if we can reach a different agreement and perhaps you could have a second referendum. If after a month or so they don\u2019t, then article 50 would have to be triggered and the negotiations to leave would begin.\u201d The Britain Stronger in Europe group dismissed Howard\u2019s claim that a second referendum could be held. A spokesperson said: \u201cMichael Howard simply is wrong to claim that voting to leave Europe could lead to Britain getting a better deal. There is simply no prospect of Britain securing further reform from outside the EU. Once we are out, we are out.

He has sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months, that his recovery is built on sand. Far from paying our way, Osborne\u2019s short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world.\u201d The chancellor spoke out after the latest nominal GDP numbers released by the Office for National Statistics showed that the cash size of the economy was 1% smaller than previously assessed. That represents a fall of \u00a318bn. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is widely expected to embark on a dramatic downwards revision of its growth targets at the time of the budget next month. This will raise questions about whether the chancellor will be able to meet his target of delivering an overall budget surplus of \u00a310.1bn by 2019-20 in time for the next general election. The OBR handed the chancellor a lifeline at the time of his autumn statement last November by saying that better than expected tax receipts and lower debt interest had improved the public finances to the tune of \u00a327bn. This allowed Osborne to ease back on planned cuts to tax credits and to confirm that he would deliver a high surplus by the time of the election.

But the slowing of economic growth and falling tax receipts means that the public finances will be distinctly less rosy. It is understood that the chancellor will signal that the spending cuts, which will be relatively modest and will be drawn from efficiency savings, will be introduced towards the end of the current parliament. The chancellor told the BBC: \u201cI\u2019ll set out how, if we need to, we will reduce spending, but the first place I look is to further efficiency in government.  \u201cThere are always ways to make government better; always ways to make sure that the taxes people watching this pay, are better spent ... We\u2019ve shown you can deliver more bang for your buck, frankly, and we can deliver value for money for the taxpayer while giving improved public services for people.\u201d The chancellor may also revise his budget surplus target. He is still committed to delivering an overall budget surplus but regards it as an insurance policy and a buffer against economic uncertainty. Osborne told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken judgments to get that budget surplus. Now, of course, as the global economy gets more difficult \u2013 and I think everyone accepts things have got particularly difficult since the start of the year \u2013 as more information comes in, we make sure that the essentials of our plan \u2013 which are Britain lives within its means, Britain can only spend what it can afford \u2013 those things are applied to our public expenditure.\u201d  The chancellor added: \u201cBut people should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure because in the end that\u2019s what people\u2019s livelihoods and jobs depend on.\u201d The chancellor has already shown a flexible approach on the surplus by delaying it by a year from the target he set out before the election. In the March 2015 budget, he pledged to deliver a \u00a35.2bn surplus by 2018-19, rising to \u00a37bn in 2019-20. In the summer budget last July, the chancellor delayed the surplus until 2019-20 although he forecast it would be a higher rate of \u00a310bn by then.

Osborne said in a statement that G20 finance ministers and officials were unanimous that a possible British exit from the European Union would be a shock to the global economy.  \u201cHere at the G20, finance leaders and central bank governors of the world\u2019s biggest economies have raised serious concerns about the risks posed by a UK exit from the EU,\u201d Osborne said in a statement from Shanghai.  \u201cThey have concluded unanimously today that what they call the shock of a potential UK vote to leave is among the biggest economic dangers this year.\u201d The G20 Brexit warning will be welcomed by the prime minister David Cameron as he tries to make the case for the UK to stay in the EU when the referendum is held on 23 June.  His cause has been dealt a blow by the declaration of the London mayor Boris Johnson for the leave camp.   Related: Boris Johnson rejects idea of second EU referendum and says 'out is out'    But the G20 statement would come with the endorsement of not only Osborne but also Bank of England governor Mark Carney and would be the latest in a series of red flags from the business world. Others have included the The credit agency Moody\u2019s and IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Earlier, Osborne also warned in Shanghai that problems were brewing for the world economy and that could impact Britain\u2019s economy. He said: \u201cThe storm clouds are clearly gathering in the world economy and that has a consequence for lots of countries including Britain. Now we are weathering it better than most, but we\u2019ve just had confirmation that our own economy is not as big as we had hoped. \u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means and we have economic security.\u201d", "tags": ["Global economy", "EU referendum and Brexit", "Chinese economy", "Economics", "China", "Business", "Politics", "Foreign policy", "European Union", "G20"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-27T11:27:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/27/osborne-trying-to-distract-from-economic-woes-stamp-duty", "sentences": ["The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, attacked Osborne, who was in Shanghai for the G20 meeting of finance ministers, for attempting to distract from his recent warning that disappointing economic results meant he would need to cut public spending at the next budget further than planned."], "title": "George Osborne is \u2018trying to distract people from economic woes\u2019", "article": "The chancellor was accused on Saturday of seeking to distract people from his bombshell admission that he would have to cut public spending further in the upcoming budget by publishing \u201cestimated\u201d savings for the middle classes from his stamp duty reforms.

In a drastic bid to stem the fallout from the global financial crisis, then governor Mervyn King and his fellow policymakers also kicked off the process of pumping tens of billions of pounds into the economy. Unsurprisingly, Labour chancellor Alistair Darling welcomed the flood of money. The economy had been battered by recession, house prices were falling and unemployment was high. There have been two changes of government since then. And at the Bank too, a new man is in charge; Mark Carney came over from Canada to replace King in 2013. All of the nine people who voted for those record low borrowing costs in March 2009 have left the monetary policy committee. Those years have seen periodic warnings from economists and policymakers that interest rates would have to rise soon. But the dog never barked and here we are: marking yet another year of record low rates. They have been seven lean years for savers but seven years of tailwinds if you happen to be a finance minister. Ultra-loose monetary policy was the backdrop throughout the coalition\u2019s time in office. It was the first government since the 1940s to enjoy unchanged borrowing costs for its entire term. The way things are going, this parliament may be little different. As if to mark this unenviable anniversary, a whole host of commentators have been coming out to say monetary policy cannot do all the heavy lifting.   Related: George Osborne warns of further cuts as 'storm clouds' gather    As finance ministers around the world were setting off for the G20 meeting in Shanghai, the International Monetary Fund issued a call for them to boost public spending on infrastructure to fuel global growth. The power of monetary policy was beginning to wane, the IMF said, and those governments that could safely increase their spending should step up to the plate and act together. In a separate report on the UK, the IMF urged the government to be ready to ease back on austerity should the economy slow further. That all echoed pleas by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for its rich-country members to let up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects. Low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for recovery, the thinktank warned. Carney has been quick to dismiss the argument put forward recently that central bankers are out of ammunition. But he also joined the chorus calling for finance ministers to do their bit. Speaking in Shanghai on Friday, he accused the G20 of failing to adopt measures to boost global growth. \u201cThe G20 needs to use the time purchased by monetary policy to develop a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies,\u201d he said. The Bank governor was scathing about progress on a 2014 pledge to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. \u201cLess than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered,\u201d Carney observed. As it happened, the Shanghai meeting ended with their joint recognition that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But based on past pledges, central bankers should not get their hopes up that much will change. One has to wonder why it has taken so long for warnings about austerity to be voiced. Until recently the OECD had strongly backed George Osborne\u2019s deficit reduction programme. Such support emboldened the chancellor to talk about \u201cfixing the roof while the sun is shining\u201d. And how did he respond to the latest warnings? With defiance. \u201cStorm clouds\u201d were gathering in the world economy, with dangers for the UK, Osborne said in Shanghai. Time to get down off the roof, then, one would think. Most certainly not, the chancellor insisted. After UK growth slowed last year, it was in fact more important than ever to keep cutting, Osborne told the BBC in an interview. \u201cSo we may need to undertake further reductions in spending because this country can only afford what it can afford \u2013 and we will address that in the budget, because I\u2019m absolutely clear we\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means,\u201d he said. So it appears if you are Osborne, you do not need sunshine to cut spending after all. Not that any of his tinkering with the roof since 2010 has really been carried out in the glow of economic fair weather: just rays of artificial light from a loose monetary policy. Now that storm clouds are gathering, Osborne\u2019s austerity looks even more ill-timed. That view is backed up in new research from economists at the University of California, Davis. Only a strong economy can bear a programme of austerity without significant output losses, argue professors \u00d2scar Jord\u00e0 and Alan Taylor in the February issue of the Economic Journal. According to their analysis, a fiscal consolidation of 1% of GDP translates into a loss of 3.5% of real GDP over five years when implemented in a slump, rather than a loss of just 1.8% in a boom. Applying that to the UK post-2007, they found that, without austerity, UK real output in 2013 would have been steadily climbing above its 2007 peak, rather than staying 2% below. Right now, the UK and world economies are looking shaky and yet Osborne refuses to put aside his wrecking ball. It is time he realised that central banks can only do so much.", "tags": ["Austerity", "George Osborne", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Economic policy", "Economic recovery", "Interest rates", "Global economy", "Business", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-28T07:00:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/uk-officials-instigated-g20-brexit-warning-diplomatic-source-says-shanghai-george-osborne", "sentences": ["A bleak warning that a British exit from the EU would deliver a shock to the global economy was introduced into the formal communique of the G20 finance ministers in Shanghai after lobbying by the UK, according to diplomatic sources.", "British officials said the warning about a UK exit was raised by the Chinese before the Shanghai meeting.", "But a diplomatic source from another G20 country challenged the Treasury account and said UK officials had proposed the Brexit warning in meetings in Shanghai before the chancellor arrived.", "They, along with other financial leaders here in Shanghai, have come to a unanimous verdict that a British exit from the EU would be a shock to the world economy."], "title": "UK officials 'instigated G20 Brexit warning'", "article": "A bleak warning that a British exit from the EU would deliver a shock to the global economy was introduced into the formal communique of the G20 finance ministers in Shanghai after lobbying by the UK, according to diplomatic sources. The warning by the G20 was seized on by George Osborne who said his fellow finance ministers had \u201cgiven their unanimous verdict that a British exit from the EU would be a shock to the world economy\u201d. British officials said the warning about a UK exit was raised by the Chinese before the Shanghai meeting. But a diplomatic source from another G20 country challenged the Treasury account and said UK officials had proposed the Brexit warning in meetings in Shanghai before the chancellor arrived. The wording was then proposed by British officials.   Related: Bank of England chief accuses G20 of failing to reform to boost growth    The diplomatic source told the Guardian: \u201cIt was the British delegation who raised the issue both in drafting session and at ministerial level, and also them who proposed the wording for the communique.\u201d The suggestion by the diplomat would tally with a report in last Friday\u2019s FT(\u00a3) which said the UK was pushing the G20 finance ministers to issue the warning. The chancellor declined to be drawn on whether Britain had lobbied for the warning to be added to the communique as he used the tough wording to apply new pressure to Boris Johnson by saying the referendum was not a game.  Asked by the BBC whether he had asked for the wording, Osborne said: \u201cWell, you\u2019ve got countries round the table like the US, like the IMF, like the Chinese who frankly don\u2019t do what anyone tells them to do. They, along with other financial leaders here in Shanghai, have come to a unanimous verdict that a British exit from the EU would be a shock to the world economy. If it is a shock to the world economy, imagine what it does to Britain. So this is not some amusing adventure into the unknown.\u201d A British official said: \u201cThe Chinese leadership raised concerns about the prospect of a British exit from the EU in bilateral meetings with the chancellor well before the G20 meeting even started. And the position of the US government and others on this issue has been clear for several months. The idea that the governments of the US, China and other leading economies, let alone bank governors and the leadership of the IMF, can be told what to say and do by UK officials is ridiculous.  \u201cThe G20 finance ministers, who represent 85% of the world\u2019s economy, are unanimous in their warning that Britain leaving the EU would represent a shock to not only the British economy but that of Europe and the world.\u200e A vote to leave would be an enormous gamble with British people\u2019s jobs and livelihoods, many of which depend on free trade and the EU\u2019s single market, and the government won\u2019t apologise for making that plain.\u201d The warning from the G2o came as international business leaders urged the UK to stay in Europe, warning of the complications that could follow a Brexit vote. China\u2019s richest man and the head of Qantas have both joined the chorus of corporate heads calling on Britons to vote to remain. Billionaire Wang Jianlin, who owns businesses including Britain\u2019s Sunseeker yachts and the firm behind the One Nine Elms development in Battersea, predicted that companies from his home country could move elsewhere. He told the Sunday Times(\u00a3) that Brexit \u201cwould not be a smart choice\u201d for the UK, and separation \u201cwould create more obstacles\u201d for investors. His views were shared by the chief executive of Australian airline Qantas, Alan Joyce. \u201cI think it is in the economic interest of Britain and the EU to stay together,\u201d Joyce, who was born in Ireland and is now based in Sydney, told the Financial Times. \u201cWhat has happened in the EU in terms of free trade and the growth of economic activity has been good for the UK and the EU.\u201d   Related: EU's ban on inefficient toasters delayed to avoid pro-Brexit press attack    Several airline bosses have already come out in favour of the remain campaign. Last week Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary said he planned to brand his planes with pro-Europe slogans in the run-up to June\u2019s vote, and easyJet\u2019s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, has warned that a Brexit could herald a return to the days when flying was \u201creserved for the elite\u201d. A survey for the fund management firm Fidelity found that two-thirds of senior executives at UK and European firms believed a leave vote would have a negative impact on their businesses, while just 2% said the effect would be positive. The survey of chief executives and finance officers at firms in which the company invests found concerns over exports and inward investment. On Saturday, finance ministers from the G20 nations listed \u201cthe shock of a potential UK exit from the European Union\u201d as one of several factors posing a threat to the global recovery. Meanwhile, research among small business owners has found that 60% want to stay in the EU and only a fifth have decided to vote for Brexit. A survey of 470 owner-managed companies by the accountancy firm Moore Stephens found strong support for the remain campaign, with respondents worried that an exit could affect growth opportunities. However, some businesses said they would welcome an exit, with most citing bureaucracy associated with EU trading regulations, especially in the food industry, and the prospect of tax reductions should the UK vote to leave. On Sunday evening a pro-Brexit group for financial services workers was due to be launched. The City for Britain group has the backing of the former chancellor Norman Lamont and others including Peter Cruddas, the founder of the trading company CMC Markets.  This article was amended on 29 February 2016. We were incorrectly informed that the City for Britain group had the backing of Helena Morrissey, the chief executive of Newton Investment Management.

For 30 years she had mostly lived and worked in China, and was a fluent Mandarin speaker. But she had recently returned to the screen as a London-based BBC News channel presenter after chemotherapy for breast cancer. And she was the main breadwinner supporting two teenage children by her Chinese ex-husband, a rock drummer. James Harding, the BBC director of news and current affairs, who had personal experience of her unique qualities after founding the Financial Times\u2019s Shanghai bureau in the 1990s, asked her to return to Beijing. A new senior post was even to be created for her: China editor. \u201cMy decision to go back was a very difficult one,\u201d she says. \u201cI said no several times before I said yes. James made me go away and come back with a better answer. \u201cChina is a very difficult story to cover effectively, and I feel frustrated I have never covered it effectively. It is difficult for all of us, it is a giant piece of history rising, and we don\u2019t know what will happen, nobody knows, yet you have to make some educated guesses \u2013 report on it as it happens. \u201cI had been a bit frustrated as a presenter sitting there in that studio watching other people\u2019s reporting. James is quite clever at getting people to do what he wants. Basically he conveyed the impression it was both urgent and important. Seeing as I did too, it was a meeting of minds.\u201d Gracie had won widespread recognition reporting on China even when she wasn\u2019t living there with her White Horse Village series, screened mainly on Newsnight since 2006, which she made during visits from London. It illustrates over a decade the country\u2019s often brutal urbanisation and break with the past through people\u2019s lives in south-west China near Chongqing. \u201cIt is very hard for people to do the close-up China work, about people, and the slightly longer perspective, the \u2018first draft of history\u2019 work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd what we tend to get is coverage all of the same perspective, neither close enough nor distant enough. And I wanted to do a bit of both of those.\u201d Though Gracie\u2019s roots are in the World Service, her brief is to get China more effectively on the main channels. But she remains a defender of the BBC News channel, which is under review. \u201cIt gets slagged off a lot internally and externally, in some ways unfairly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has provided an enormously important gym for everyone to learn their skills and practise, try things out. So much of it, the great quality pieces on it, get lost. It doesn\u2019t have a means of aggregating its best output.\u201d Gracie remains wracked by the dilemmas of a working parent. The family was evacuated by the BBC back to the UK in 1999 from China because Gracie\u2019s then two-year-old daughter (now aiming for university) had leukaemia. She made the pragmatic decision to work as a London-based TV presenter because of fixed, shorter hours. Her first bout of cancer then struck in 2005. She subsequently blotted her copybook in BBC terms, if not with viewers, in 2009 when she replied honestly to a politician\u2019s question and revealed on air that her salary was \u00a392,000. \u201cI can be blunt,\u201d she says, without a trace of regret. (When told a photographer would be taking a portrait for this piece she emailed back five words: \u201cI will brush my hair.\u201d) So her former husband, who speaks no English, agreed to live in Richmond while she spends at least half a year in China. She gave up the BBC-owned flat in Beijing because \u201cI am on the road so much, a lot of China coverage should be done outside Beijing.\u201d It seems to have worked for viewers: Gracie was shortlisted for a Royal Television Society award earlier this month. She provided an informed Panorama report on President Xi Jingping\u2019s power and use of a sensational anti-corruption drive to remove rivals. She explained China\u2019s stock market collapse of last July with expertise backed by a first-class degree in PPE from Oxford, but she also found a former Manchester student now home in Shanghai to explain how he felt markets were rigged. And she visited an oppressed Muslim minority, the \u200b Uighurs, on a tourist bus. \u201cI wanted to do less of the \u2018hand in front of the lens\u2019 coverage because we all know China is like that,\u201d she says. \u201cMy view on pointing out how much we are under surveillance as reporters is to do it a bit sparingly. It can become a bit lazy.\u201d China\u2019s political situation worries her greatly. \u201cThe level of oppression, Orwellian security is very serious,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel perhaps I need to ratchet up the coverage over some of the sombre truths. It is not about surveillance of us as reporters \u2013 that is never going to be life threatening.\u201d Gracie points to the Chinese lawyers who have been in prison since last summer, as well as the Hong Kong booksellers who disappeared last December. She says China is one of the hardest places for journalists to operate. \u201cIn Beijing, at the embassy here, they try and put on pressure, it may be on the BBC here, the individual reporter. \u201cI think China has become more paranoid and more powerful since 1999. I don\u2019t remember a British chancellor talking about a golden age of China in 1999. Lots of reporters are under surveillance, bugged, I don\u2019t really want to talk about all of that. It might put certain people at risk. Any reporter should make that assumption, and keep their sources safe. The ethical questions of interviewing people are tricky.\u201d \u201cIt is still worth doing the things you can do. I like my White Horse Village pieces, you really learn meeting Chinese people. There were moments I thought I would not be allowed back. The Chinese state and minions are not all bad, there are some really intelligent, broad-minded people and at the beginning I got some significant backing. \u201cI was surprised by the way global markets reacted to July\u2019s sudden fall in the stock market. The Chinese economy is so confoundedly complex, in the ways in which all the bits hang together and politics interfaces with economy. I don\u2019t blame the global markets, it is impossible for anyone to understand.\u201d Gracie is currently taking long service leave until the summer to supervise her children\u2019s A-level exams, while thinking up fresh series. \u201cI am too old to spend all my time in China,\u201d she says. \u201cI find it a hard environment, very punishing, the pollution, congestion, travelling, intensity of surveillance, difficult ethical issues. I have to recharge my batteries, I\u2019m not 32 any more. I should do slightly more longer form, slightly less crashing about on daily news.\u201d She still spends three hours a day reading coverage and keeping on top of developments in China. And despite the challenges of covering the country, there is little sign she\u2019s losing her passion for its stories.

Varying periods of dominance from the likes of Sydney City, Marconi, South Melbourne and Melbourne Croatia helped see to that.  It\u2019s only natural that the two biggest cities, both with strong football heartlands, should also constantly be at the fore in the A-League.   Related: David Carney's late equaliser gives Sydney FC consolation against Victory    In theory, that dominance should be further enhanced as the A-League continues to settle into a groove. Only Brisbane Roar\u2019s bright start prevented the Sydney-Melbourne quartet holding down the top-four spots for the first time ever earlier this season.  It has taken a while for Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC to collectively get their act together on a consistent basis over the first 10 years of the competition. Indeed, with sensible management and diligent recruiting, a level of dominance should be the case more often than not given the clubs\u2019 respective resources. Melbourne Victory have been stable for several years now, while Sydney FC (or Sydney City as my octogenarian father inadvertently calls them, albeit without any ironic intent), have been in a similar position for the past couple of seasons.  Last season was the first time both clubs looked set for a lengthy period of supremacy in the A-League. The pair were clearly the competition\u2019s best, and few predicted this season would be any different. Both started promisingly enough. Yet their lack of momentum has been surprising, as it has been unanticipated.  The 1-1 draw between the pair on Saturday does little for the either cause. Sydney FC are winless in seven matches now, while Melbourne Victory are five consecutive A-League matches without a win. Had Sydney managed to find a winner it would have been consecutive home defeats for Victory for the first time in over a decade.  It is not easy to pinpoint the reasons for the respective slides. Those looking for positives will say they are both just a couple of wins off the top, but the results present a more negative view. With six rounds remaining, Sydney FC have won only half as many games as last season, while Victory are in a similar position. Twelve months ago they seemed to be incrementally inching away from the rest of the field, but the pair\u2019s A-League hegemony is still some way off.  A salary cap league makes the kind of dominance enjoyed by big city clubs in Europe a far less likely proposition. Interestingly though, had Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC maintained last season\u2019s form then this season\u2019s competition ladder would roughly mirror population.  The derbies \u2013 of which Victory against the Sky Blues is one, certainly more so than those contrived at a marketing workshop \u2013 are invariably chaotic affairs played at a frenetic pace, where upsets or tight matches are more frequent. Sydney and Melbourne clubs will say that the quantity of derbies makes their task tougher. Clubs from further afield will point to more frequent travel as an impediment. Both views have some validity.  An eight-point gap between Victory and the Sky Blues and top spot is surely now unreachable with six rounds remaining. They both sit just two points ahead of seventh-placed Perth Glory, but arguably it is the latter that has their nose in front in the race for a finals berth. Certainly on pure form Perth are the team to beat of that trio, while the hopes of the traditional big two are further diluted by their participation in the Champions League.   Related: Durante factor helped Wellington home against City, says Ernie Merrick     Sydney, additionally, face a host of injuries and suspensions ahead of next week\u2019s return to Melbourne to take on City. It will be quite a week for Graham Arnold\u2019s side with their two hugely challenging away trips sandwiched either side of a home Champions League outing against Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande.  Despite the stalemate on Saturday, there was plenty of entertainment on show, though only fleeting glimpses of quality. Wily David Carney chalked one up for the nay-saying ageists by outfoxing youngster Thomas Deng to execute a superb run and finish, one which was harder than it may have seemed. Victory\u2019s goal, from the sometimes underrated Kosta Barbarouses, was one many would not have scored. The Kiwi will be sorely missed if his rumoured exit to Wellington Phoenix is confirmed.  Melbourne Victory\u2019s imports have mostly provided more value than their rivals. Sydney defender Jacques Faty constantly seems a defensive accident waiting to happen, while the club are yet to reap full dividend from their attacking imports at the other end of the field.  Both teams certainly lack little when it comes to passion, hunger and even resilience. There is, perhaps, a case of the teams being imbued in the image of their respective coaches.  Indeed, the entertainment was, as always, accentuated by a couple of pantomime villains on the coach\u2019s benches. How the fourth official must have cursed when the appointments list came out, while one of his colleagues was able to enjoy the soothing presence of Ernie Merrick and John van \u2019t Schip on Friday in Wellington. The appealing, berating and constant sense of indignation rarely abates.  Four days earlier \u2013 without the collective energy given off by Kevin Muscat and Arnold \u2013 there were notably more seagulls at AAMI Park with the ice-cool Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson on the sideline.

Ornithology aside, Arnold was ever the stoker of embers, saying that Barbarouses should have been sent off for a first-half challenge. He had a strong case, but failure to point out other unpunished misdemeanours, including Faty\u2019s first \u2013half \u201cdon\u2019t argue\u201d on Besart Berisha, do little to convince the viewer that an objective opinion is being offered.  Oddly, for all Sydney FC\u2019s recent dominance over Western Sydney Wanderers, they continue to struggle to overcome Victory. It is now nine matches since Sydney\u2019s last win over their oldest rivals dating back to a game enlivened by one Alessandro Del Piero. How time has quickly passed since that era.

The Sky Blues, like their cross-city rivals, have a strong track-record when it comes to goals in the final quarter-hour. Sydney have now managed to secure draws in five of their nine matches in which they have conceded first.  The big winners on the weekend \u2013 aided by the draw in Melbourne \u2013 were Adelaide United. The Reds are now 13 matches without defeat following a strangely one-sided 3-0 win over Brisbane Roar, who went into the weekend in second. Adelaide did of course lose, rather unluckily in the Champions League a few weeks back. And that defeat may prove to a blessing in disguise given the looming physical and mental challenge facing Victory and Sydney FC. United are enjoying rare confidence at the moment and if momentum is any indicator, it is they who will win the premier\u2019s plate.

The surprise drop in prices marked the third time in a year that inflation has turned negative, fanning fears that the eurozone is headed for all-out deflation \u2013 a sustained period of falling prices. The news cemented market expectations that the ECB would use its meeting next week to inject fresh cash into the single currency bloc and to cut a key interest rate further into negative territory.   Related: Central bankers on the defensive as weird policy becomes even weirder    Headline inflation dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in January, according to an early estimate from statistics office Eurostat. That contrasted with forecasts for a reading of zero in a Reuters poll of economists.  Low energy prices were the main factor behind the drop, but price pressures in other areas of the economy played a part. There was also a drop in core inflation \u2013 taken as a guide to underlying price \u2013 adding to signs that low inflation was becoming more entrenched as eurozone economies battled with sluggish global demand from a fresh slowdown and the lingering impact of the last financial crisis.  Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of unprocessed food and energy, fell more than expected to 0.8% from 1% in January and was its lowest since April last year. Economists said the inflation numbers raised questions over the firepower of central banks to revive growth and prices. Deflation concerns central bank policymakers because it can lead to consumers delaying spending in the anticipation of good becoming cheaper, creating a cycle of diminishing demand that hits economic growth.  This year will be the fourth year of inflation undershooting the ECB\u2019s target of close to 2%, said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at French banking group Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. There were no limits to the ECB\u2019s willingness \u201cbut clear limits to its effectiveness\u201d, he said. \u201cDespite its best efforts, the ECB\u2019s challenge to break the backbone of lowflation remains a tall order. Looking set to miss its target for a fourth year this year, we expect it to miss it for another four years, at least, without the help of more substantial economic reform. That won\u2019t stop the ECB from doing what it must according to its self-imposed target, but with markets increasingly unconvinced, we are approaching the \u2018effective\u2019 limit of the ECB\u2019s tools.\u201d The inflation figures follow warnings from the IMF and the OECD that governments cannot rely on low interest rates and money-printing programmes to shore up growth. A weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group of countries ended with a similar statement that \u201cmonetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth\u201d. But the policymakers failed to come up with a concrete plan of how they might revive a sluggish world economy. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used his speech at the Shanghai meeting to insist central bankers still had ammunition left to boost growth. But he too argued for more help from governments.  This week marks seven years of UK interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and Carney has hinted that he is prepared to cut the base rate further but has ruled out following the trend seen in other countries for negative rates, where depositors are effectively charged for parking their money. The Bank of Japan recently joined the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December, amid signs of a strongly growing US economy. But a string of poor economic figures since then raised doubts about any future rate-rises and even prompted some economists to speculate the move could be reversed. The ECB meets again next week to decide its next move and its chief, Mario Draghi, has already indicated the central bank will announce moves to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone. Economists expect the Frankfurt-based body to expand its quantitative easing programme \u2013 where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions \u2013 and to further cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%. Another reduction in the deposit rate means it would be charging banks more to hold their money overnight. The weak core inflation figure \u201cpretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing\u201d at next week\u2019s meeting, said Teunis Brosens at ING bank. \u201cThe weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern Europe, which will have little scope to \u2018inflate away\u2019 their debt burden by increasing nominal wages,\u201d Brosens said.", "tags": ["Eurozone", "Business", "Economics", "Inflation", "Deflation", "European Central Bank", "Europe", "European Union", "European monetary union", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2016-02-29T19:52:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/01/paris-french-retailer-franpix-delivers-goods-by-boat-river-seine-transport-water-future-urban-logistics", "sentences": ["With this grand design, Grumbach, who in 1996 also won a competition to design a (never-built) \u201cgarden bridge\u201d over the Thames in London, proposed to transform Paris into a port city like New York or Shanghai."], "title": "Paris's river revolution: the supermarket that delivers groceries via the Seine", "article": "On a quiet tributary of the river Seine, 10km away from Paris\u2019s centre, a barge loaded up with containers is getting ready to set off from the harbour of Bonneuil-sur-Marne. The industrial landscape of the harbour owned by the Paris port authority clashes with the surrounding bucolic scenery: the river Marne was a popular bathing spot until the 1970s, when swimming was forbidden because of pollution.  The barge \u2013 whose containers are filled with grocery goods ready to be dispatched to stores and sold \u2013 is the centrepiece of an ambitious project that is slowly putting the river Seine back at the forefront of Paris\u2019s urban logistics. French grocery retailer Franprix\u2019s pioneering delivery scheme supplies 135 of its 350 Parisian stores via the Seine, taking as many as 2,600 lorries off the city\u2019s roads each year. And there is room for more: Franprix alludes to the possibility of stocking most of its Parisian stores via water. As Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo openly puts the breaking up of car culture at the top of her agenda, are innovative schemes such as \u201cFranprix en Seine\u201d the future of urban transportation?   \u201cWe\u2019re the only grocery retailer worldwide to use river transport for the final leg of our goods\u2019 journey. We are pioneers,\u201d says St\u00e9phane Tuot, Franprix\u2019s head of logistics.      Until the end of the 18th century, two-thirds of the goods consumed or traded in Paris reached the city via the Seine. Photograph: Roger Viollet/Getty Images    The supermarket chain launched its scheme in 2012, with significant financial and political support from the European Union, the French state, the Parisian region and the port of Paris. \u201cThe vast majority of our stores are in Paris and its suburbs, forming a dense network. Our main warehouse is a few kilometres away from the city centre, close to Bonneuil-sur-Marne, one of Paris\u2019s main ports. Relying on the Seine seemed logical.\u201d The company does not hide the fact that, even with some financial support from public stakeholders, it is much more expensive to transport goods via the river instead of the road. Why do it then?     The Port de la Bourdonnais terminal in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. Photograph: Helene Pambrun    \u201cWe want to be ahead of the game; there are more and more constraints on transportation via lorries, and it will only increase in the future,\u201d says Tuot, mentioning the ban on diesel vehicles from 2020, and the possibility of a Parisian congestion charge by the end of Mayor Hidalgo\u2019s term in 2021.  The Seine\u2019s identity is much more complex than the cliche of a quiet city river cornered by tourism. The touristic aspect of the Seine\u2019s economy is indeed strong: with 8 million passengers transported each year, Paris is the busiest inland harbour in the world. But with 20m tonnes of goods conveyed each year, it is also the second largest in Europe for merchandise.  After three hours of journey, two locks and 21km of navigation, Franprix\u2019s barge arrives at the Port de la Bourdonnais, a tiny facility squeezed between the Eiffel Tower and the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly. The harbour offers two attributes and activities: a pier for bateaux mouches (open excursion boats) on one hand; on the other, a bijou container terminal used by the construction industry and Franprix.  Tuot says his company\u2019s scheme is far from having reached its full capacity: \u201cThere is room to have much more merchandise transiting via the Seine, and we hope to announce new partnerships in the near future. In the long term, if we\u2019re accompanied by public bodies and the right investments, there\u2019s room to deliver all of our 350 Parisian stores via the Seine \u2013 that\u2019s totally doable.\u201d The scheme has already demonstrated its efficiency by taking lorries of the road: Franprix calculated it saves the equivalent of 300,000km of road transit, almost 9,000 times the length of Paris\u2019s ring road.     Franprix supplies 135 of its 350 Parisian stores via the Seine, taking 2,600 lorries off the city\u2019s roads each year. Photograph: Helene Pambrun for the Guardian    While it remains a drop in an ocean of pollution, the city looks at such urban logistic solutions with great interest. In her city hall office, Paris deputy mayor C\u00e9lia Blauel, in charge of sustainable development and water, says that the Seine and Paris\u2019s canals are key to their strategy for a greener and more sustainable Paris. The socialist mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb (2001-2014) and his successor have both supported controversial plans to get rid of the motorways that run along the Seine and give the riverbanks back to pedestrians. According to Blauel, more will be done to promote leisure and tourism for the Seine, for instance, an objective to allow Parisians to bathe in the Seine by 2030. But enhancing the role of the Seine as an infrastructure will also be crucial. \u201cMore cars and lorries is not the solution for Paris, we need to get rid of that way to navigate the city.\u201d While schemes such as Franprix en Seine remain notable exceptions, the role of the river Seine in Paris\u2019s future is about to benefit from a significant boost. Following strong interest around the urban design competition \u201cReinvent Paris\u201d \u2013 which saw international teams of urbanists and architects contending to redevelop 23 sites in Paris \u2013 City Hall confirmed to The Guardian that Mayor Hidalgo will, on 14 March, announce \u201cReinvent the Seine\u201d, a similar scheme focusing on 40 sites all along the river.      According to St\u00e9phane Tuot, \u2018There\u2019s room to deliver all of our 350 Parisian stores via the Seine \u2013 that\u2019s totally doable.\u2019 Photograph: Helene Pambrun for the Guardian    The instigator of Reinvent Paris, Deputy-mayor Jean-Louis Missika, a sociologist-turned-politician who is serving his third term in office, believes every global city needs the sea, adding that, \u201cThe Greater Paris needs to rely on the Seine to design a \u2018blue framework\u2019 from Paris to Le Havre.\u201d  This idea has gained momentum since Paris-based architect Antoine Grumbach proposed in 2009 to design a Greater Paris with the Seine as its spine, on a Paris-Rouen-Le Havre axis. With this grand design, Grumbach, who in 1996 also won a competition to design a (never-built) \u201cgarden bridge\u201d over the Thames in London, proposed to transform Paris into a port city like New York or Shanghai. \u201cThe competition Reinvent the Seine, developed hand in hand with the cities of Rouen and Le Havre, will be about casting a new light on to the Seine,\u201d Missika explains. \u201cIt will be about enabling architects, urbanists and citizens to dream, and have crazy ideas about the Seine and its future.\u201d    Related: Reinventing Paris: 10 winning urban designs to transform the city    Yet as Paris rediscovers the charms and assets of the Seine, the scenic river risks a clash of competing activities \u2014 on the one hand, riverbanks reclaimed for pedestrians, floating structures such as swimming pools and hotels, and the popular Paris Plage, which transforms the Seine into an urban beach every summer; on the other, the rise of river-based urban logistics and the building of new facilities, along with ever-increasing passenger traffic. \u201cOne thing is certain: today the Seine is Paris\u2019s most attractive public space,\u201d Missika says. \u201cThat is why we need to get urbanists and architects thinking about how to anticipate and resolve these conflicts.\u201d Today, however, Franprix\u2019s lonely barge with its emptied containers is quietly sailing back to the port of Bonneuil-sur-Marne, while traffic jams continue to build up on the Seine\u2019s soon-to-be-pedestrianised riverbanks.

Between them, they controlled $19.3tn in assets, down from $22tn the year before. This reflected the rollercoaster global stock markets, the slump in commodity prices and slowing economic growth in China and other countries. The number of dollar millionaires around the globe also fell from 13.6 million in 2014 to 13.3 million last year. Together, they hold assets worth $66tn \u2013 more than the value of all global shares added together.

Andrew Shirley, the editor of the wealth report, said: \u201cAlthough no classic car managed to beat the record set by Bonhams in 2014 when it auctioned a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta for $38m, eight of the 25 cars ever to have sold for over $10m at auction went under the hammer in 2015.\u201d Wine and luxury watches both posted 5% increases.

Related: UK company to introduce 'period policy' for female staff    Attempts by firms and governments to synchronise work with the body\u2019s natural cycles have struggled to gain acceptance in Asia, even though countries in the region were among the first to recognise period pains as a legitimate reason for taking time off. In China, the debate over menstrual leave intensified this month after the eastern province of Anhui became the third area to introduce \u201cperiod leave\u201d. The extension has given hope to women\u2019s rights activists that Beijing and Shanghai might soon join Anhui, Shanxi and Hebei provinces in granting working women time off because of severe menstrual pain. In Japan, where authorities granted working women a similar entitlement soon after the end of the second world war, fear of social stigma means many women who need time off take regular sick leave rather than draw male colleagues\u2019 attention to their menstrual cycle. Several women who spoke to the Guardian said they did not know if their employer offered menstrual leave, while others said they had never thought seriously about using the entitlement.

The measure, which leaves it to individual firms to decide how many days are permitted \u2013 and whether they are paid \u2013 came as large numbers of women were entering the postwar labour market but often worked in places with few sanitary facilities. An agency worker employed by the Japanese government said she had never been encouraged to take menstrual leave by her superiors. \u201cIt was mentioned in the company policy document I received when I started working there,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t read it throughly.

It was not immediately clear if many women in Anhui were aware of the new regulation. Wang Guoyan, a 36-year-old worker at Anhui\u2019s University of Science and Technology of China, said she had not heard about the policy but generally supported the intent. \u201cIf so, I feel it is very good.

Although some have been supportive, many are sceptical. \u201cLooks like it is protecting women\u2019s rights, but it eventually will make things worse,\u201d wrote one commenter, @Woshiyamiedie. \u201cThe discrimination at work will never end if the rights of women and men are not balanced.\u201d A Japanese woman who had taken time off due to period pains said women were reluctant to cite their menstrual cycle as the reason for requesting time off, partly because it would affect their income.   Related: Painkillers, hot water bottles \u2013 and a day off work: the benefits of a period policy    \u201cI have taken several days off for period pains but I never described it as that to my boss, even though my company has a menstrual leave provision,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of my female colleagues do the same. There is a policy in place for period leave, but no one takes it because it is not a paid holiday.\u201d Another woman who works for a recruitment firm said she was entitled to up to 10 days\u2019 paid menstrual leave a year, but had never taken it. \u201cRegardless of the reason for taking any sick leave, my company will always encourage me to take it if necessary. My boss and colleagues often encourage me to take holidays so I can stay happy, refreshed and efficient at work,\u201d she said. South Korea introduced a law in 2001 that allows women to take one day of menstrual leave per month. Many South Korean women, however, say they are deeply uncomfortable about asking male bosses for time off. \u201cEvery time I ask for time off, I feel guilty towards my co-workers since I know they have to do share my work,\u201d Yoon Jin\u2013sung, a 28-year-old worker at a male-dominated company, told the Korea Times in 2014.  \u201cI don\u2019t think my male colleagues understand the pain we have to go through during our period. Without such an understanding or a solid system that guarantees that right, I think most of us would rather bite the bullet by taking medicine, which I do all the time to relieve my pain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be perceived as receiving privileges just because I am a woman. But it\u2019s not a privilege at all.

It just cannot be done when Chinese Super League clubs have spent about \u00a3200m over the winter and the country\u2019s second tier is the third highest-spending league in the world. Just as with the billionaire who made his money in real estate, the recent cash splashed by property developer-owned Chinese clubs also risks overshadowing everything else.   Related: Why China, not MLS, is luring stars away from Europe    The return of real football, then, is a relief to fans and journalists \u2013 who have been excitedly regurgitating every crazy rumour in the western media about possible targets, rumours that continued to appear even after the transfer window closed on 28 February \u2013 even if they have enjoyed this most off-the-wall of off-seasons. The 2016 Chinese Super League season started with Hebei China Fortune beating Guangzhou R&amp;F 2-1, with Gervinho scoring the winner, and there will be an unprecedented amount of global interest to see how recently acquired stars such as Alex Teixeira, Ramires, Jackson Mart\u00ednez, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Fredy Guar\u00edn and others perform in the coming months. It remains to be seen how long the curiosity continues. It may recede quite rapidly only to burst back into life when the big names say something negative or return home ahead of schedule. That will happen sooner or later. Some signings succeed, others do not. China and Chinese football can be a culture shock, even in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. More remote outposts such as Qinhuangdao will at least ensure that there are less distractions for Lavezzi and Gervinho as they seek to help newly promoted Hebei China Fortune prosper in the top tier. The reigning champions, Guangzhou Evergrande, are the team to beat. These original big-spenders have caused, in part, this recent spending spree as others seek to catch the side who have won the last five domestic titles. Robinho has left the club, as has Elkeson, but the Brazilian influence is still strong, thanks to Luiz Felipe Scolari, Ricardo Goulart and Paulinho. Throw in Kim Young-gwon of South Korea, perhaps Asia\u2019s top defender, and much of the Chinese national team, and you have a strong squad. And, of course, there is Mart\u00ednez \u2013 bought from part-Chinese-owned Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for about \u00a332m. The Colombian has yet to impress in two Asian Champions League games and the Chinese media have even started to question whether he was the right signing. Harsh, perhaps, but expectations have become as high as transfer fees in Guangzhou.   Related: Chinese football's unglamorous past    If the goals come, then title No6 is a strong possibility but, if not, for the first time since 2010, there could be a new name on the trophy. That would leave Shanghai SIPG, Beijing Guoan, Shandong Luneng and Jiangsu Suning looking to get in on the act. Especially Shanghai. Last season\u2019s runners-up pushed Guangzhou all the way and felt they should have triumphed. In the September showdown between the two in Shanghai, victory would have taken Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s men four points clear at the top with only five games to go and an easier run-in. Yet again, however, Scolari defeated Eriksson when the stakes were high, adding Shanghai to the list of Shizuoka, Lisbon and Gelsenkirchen, thanks to the most professional of performances. Robinho, Goulart and Elkeson scored in a 3-0 win and Guangzhou went on to take the title. Elkeson is now a Shanghai player, having been sold for \u00a314m \u2013 either a show of Guangzhou\u2019s confidence or, some cynics claim, a result of a little pressure from above to spread some Brazilian goalscoring wealth around the league. Elkeson links up in Shanghai with Asamoah Gyan, signed last summer following a stint in the United Arab Emirates in what was then an Asian transfer record. Gyan\u2019s report would read as satisfactory but he has, as yet, failed to live up to expectations, despite having the playmaker Dar\u00edo Conca behind him as well as China\u2019s top attacking talent in Wu Lei.     Ramires signed for Jiangsu Suning from Chelsea in January. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images    That transfer record has been broken three times since, twice by Jiangsu Suning. The former mid-table mediocrity, coached by Dan Petrescu, were taken over at the end of last season by Suning, a large retail group with very deep pockets. After chasing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the club turned to Ramires, Teixeira and the former Manchester City and Everton striker J\u00f4. The stated aim is to bring the Chinese title to Nanjing in three years and the Asian crown within five \u2013 but sooner would be better. Shandong Luneng and Beijing Guoan finished third and fourth respectively last season. This pair each won a title in the two years before Guangzhou began their domination and have suffered the most because of the influx of big money. At first, Beijing especially sneered at the shallow southerners and their reams of renminbi but it has become a case of if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, sign \u2018em. Beijing have the talented Brazilian Renato Augusto in midfield and the former Milan manager Alberto Zaccheroni on the bench, while Shandong will be coached by Mano Menezes \u2013 the growing number of big-name international coaches is an aspect of the Chinese Super League often overlooked \u2013 who has Diego Tardelli leading his line.

The Blues upset fans by releasing Tim Cahill in February, despite the Australian having a great season in 2015. Obafemi Martins and Guarin join Demba Ba in Shanghai. The other wild card is Hebei and the signings of Gervinho and Lavezzi should be enough to keep the new boys in the league and in with a chance of a cup win, and the resultant Asian Champions League spot. The continental competition will be a factor in 2016. With two out of the last three Champions Leagues and the last five Chinese titles going to Guangzhou, the Reds have plenty of experience of winning on two fronts. The other three teams involved \u2013 Shanghai SIPG, Shandong and Jiangsu \u2013 have spent enough to reach the knockout rounds of the tournament but not enough to win at home and abroad. They may have to choose. Guangzhou are still the team to beat. A strong and settled squad, with a pragmatic, experienced coach, and a team who know how to win.

He fiercely resists the Eurosceptic fantasies of the Conservative right and stands firmly alongside the prime minister in making the case for Britain staying inside the EU, a brave career move given the Tory party\u2019s fevered internal politics. Within his self-imposed constraints, he has tried to preserve spending on science and infrastructure. Despite his tough talk, he has shown a welcome flexibility in meeting his targets for lowering the public deficit. He even managed to smuggle through long-overdue tax increases in his budget last July. So, good in parts. But 10 days away from a second important budget, he remains wedded to a way of thinking about the inter-relationship between government and the wider economy that would not pass muster in an economics GCSE. The sequence of remarks he made in a BBC interview at the G20 meeting last month in Shanghai are just plain wrong. \u201cThe country can only afford what it can afford,\u201d he declared. Wrong. Governments may have budget constraints, countries are different. And, in any case, affordability is not an absolute but contingent on interest rates and expected growth. Affordability at near zero interest rates is different from affordability at 10% interest rates. Then came \u201cstorm clouds\u201d and the \u201ceconomy is smaller than we thought\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ve got to root our country in the principle that we must live within our means\u201d in order to ensure \u201ceconomic security\u201d; Mr Osborne felt he had to cut government spending again towards the end of this parliament. Wrong. This will make the storm clouds more threatening, only partially mitigated by his promise to soften the blow through focusing on \u201cefficiency savings\u201d and perhaps reducing or deferring the target for the budget surplus. Nonetheless, it was an unnecessarily disconcerting thing to say. To cap it all, he declared that \u201cthe last time we didn\u2019t live within our means we were right in the front rank of nations facing economic crisis\u201d. Wrong. The banking crisis developed independently of government fiscal policy. Three fundamental errors underpin his worldview. The first is that he conflates country and government and defines living within our means wholly in terms of the government\u2019s finances. Yet Britain\u2019s international trading position is ominously in the red, running a current account deficit of 5% of GDP and set to rise. Exports stagnate, imports boom. This really is living beyond our means, but about which the chancellor says zilch. Instead, he makes matters worse, selling government assets such as the Green Investment Bank or, last year, Eurostar to foreigners, so that more interest and dividends flow overseas. One of the concerns about Brexit is that foreigners holding sterling will realise that the country is not credit-worthy and there will be a flight of capital. Mr Osborne can hardly not know this, but he continues blithely to define living within our means as a government challenge, rather than a wider challenge to the entire public and private sector. Second, there are choices about how governments choose to balance expenditure and revenue. The Institute for Fiscal Studies\u2019 illuminating green budget shows that by 2019/20, public expenditure outside health will fall to the lowest proportion of GDP since at least 1948. Between 2010 and 2019, spending by the Ministry of Justice will have nearly halved. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills\u2019 spending will have fallen by just over 40% and the Home Office by just less. These are breathtaking figures. They imply the emasculation of innovation, of prison, probation, court and security systems, alongside an assault on local government. This gets into the very marrow of our civilisation: for example, London\u2019s royal parks, to raise revenue in this absurd framework, will have to turn themselves into ongoing circus and event spaces to fund themselves. Does this very rich country want or need any of this? All because of a stubborn refusal to countenance all but closet tax increases. The government will receive \u00a347bn in excise duty on alcohol, fuel and cigarettes this year. Forty years ago, it raised nearly the equivalent of \u00a380bn. Some of the shortfall is because, thankfully, we smoke less, but most of it is because taxation on alcohol and fuel has been scaled back. The government does not even countenance a sugar tax. The latest news is that the chancellor has shelved plans to raise taxes by withdrawing allowances for richer pension savers \u2013 a stealth tax \u2013 because it has been seen through for what it is. He should just be upfront. Taxes on alcohol and on fuel are too low; equally, there should be a tax on sugar. Raise them and crucial public services can be saved. But perhaps the most egregious error is to define economic security wholly in terms of government book-keeping. The financial crisis had nothing to do with public expenditure and public deficits and everything to do with the way global banks had extended vast amounts of credit to dodgy borrowers with very little core capital of their own to act as a buffer. Mr Osborne is busy relaxing the already not very onerous proposed reregulation of our banks. It is a City commonplace that sooner or later there will be another financial crisis because the system\u2019s failings have not been addressed. In these terms, turning Regent\u2019s Park into an events space and our prisons into hellholes will not increase our economic security one iota. True economic security requires a wholesale reinvention of how companies are owned and financed, of how our banks are run and how innovation is supported. Readers will note that this column is a critique of the way Mr Osborne has exerted sovereign economic power within our EU membership. We do not need to leave it to change policy, nor have Mr Osborne\u2019s choices been constrained by membership. He knows that too. To put so much trade and investment at risk while threatening the capacity of the EU to hold together in order to chase a chimera of absolute sovereignty is folly. Only in the Conservative party could such a statement of the obvious be seen as brave, but Osborne, on this issue, is just that. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell might mark and learn. Nothing is easier than attacking Osborne economically. Harder and more important is to recognise that on the EU he is right and to make outspoken common cause, sharing platforms with unflinching solidarity. Momentum, the grassroots movement of Corbyn supporters, will like it no more than the denizens of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s parties, but there come moments in political lives when great politicians have to stand up and be counted.

Given his multiple talents \u2013 from international soloist to musical ambassador to exuberant bling-and-glamour fashionista (he has his own perfume, headphones and, coming soon, piano-themed Swiss watch) \u2013 maybe it\u2019s not an improbable comparison. \u201cNo, no, no! Please, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m Google!\u201d Lang Lang laughs, clapping his hands to his head in mock horror. His name means sunny, twice over. He is. Fringe flopping, casually dressed in sweatshirt, jeans and Air Jordan trainers (he\u2019s a big fan of the basketball player), Lang Lang bounces into a windowless basement meeting room in a Madrid hotel as if it\u2019s the only place he\u2019d want to be. He comments, in passing, that he is getting so sick of being on aeroplanes, in halls and hotels that he may take up marathon running, just to get some oxygen into his lungs. \u201cI am, first and last, a classical musician. But when you sit down and practise, technical issues apart, what I\u2019m concerned about is how music can touch us, what can I learn from the piano in life? That should be the concrete thinking for everyone. OK, when I was two, I wanted to be No 1, best in the world. But it was all a fantasy, a wild dream.

Lang Lang can put himself down more adroitly, and with more wit, than those critics who cannot see beyond his audacious showmanship and extrovert playing. Can it be that someone who plays Happy at the Grammys with Pharrell Williams can also perform exquisite Rachmaninov? His biggest admirers \u2013 among them Simon Rattle, with whom he has recorded concertos by Bart\u00f3k and Prokofiev, and Daniel Barenboim, his great mentor \u2013 certainly think so. His own piano heroes are Vladimir Horowitz, also a great showman; and Maurizio Pollini and Martha Argerich, decided introverts.         Lang Lang on music education    Lang Lang\u2019s features cloud momentarily when he considers the gainsayers. \u201cIt makes me sad. It stings a little, yes, but I have to ignore it. We all accept, even enjoy, the way sports stars or Hollywood actors behave. I want to show that classical can be cool and fun too. Is that so bad?\u201d Despite having a recital that evening, Lang Lang has agreed to this interview to promote his new piano method for children aged five to 10, published by Faber. Next month, he will play a concert for children at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, with all tickets \u00a35. This latest educational venture is an extension of the Lang Lang Piano Academy, launched in 2014, and the Lang Lang International Music Foundation for more advanced players, two of whom will play alongside him.

A cherubic, doll-eyed Lang Lang cartoon figure acts as guide, with accompanying online audio tracks and performances by the pianist himself. The essence, however, is technique. \u201cNo one likes to be faced with nothing but scales and arpeggios,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get bored. At the same time, these are the building blocks of music. How do you make beauty without the tools?\u201d If you could install a smiling Lang Lang in every home with a child trying to learn the piano \u2013 surely only a matter of time, there\u2019s already an app \u2013 practice sessions might be transformed. Forty million children, many inspired by Lang Lang, now study the piano in China. Maybe none will become professional, but they will have encountered music from within, through their own endeavours, and discovered how it works. That\u2019s what Lang Lang wants.  His own childhood, despite his incredible success, does not recommend itself. As a boy, he and his father lived in Shanghai away from his mother, who stayed home to earn a living to pay for his lessons. Tales of rat-infested rooms and battles with his disciplinarian tiger-father (they are at peace now) have been told many times.     You must be fit to be a pianist: muscles, breathing, flexibility. Running marathons will help.    By nine, the prodigy felt a failure when a conservatoire professor told him he had no talent. He went into brief retirement \u2013 until the age of 10, when he took it up again with renewed fervour. By 20 he had two dozen concertos under his belt and a public profile that has expanded year by year. Now he is on the road some 300 days a year. Where does he live? Private life doesn\u2019t figure much on Lang Lang\u2019s agenda, though he has many high-profile friends, especially from the worlds of fashion and sport. \u201cOn a plane,\u201d is his half-serious answer, qualifying it to \u201cbetween New York and China\u201d. He takes time off in the summer, to rest and learn new work, currently Spanish composers Alb\u00e9niz and Granados.  Recently, for fun, he played piano four hands with the Brazilian footballer Neymar, who\u2019s mad keen on the piano. The touching aspect of their duet, captured on YouTube, is how Lang Lang manages to fit around Neymar\u2019s rhythmically eccentric rendition of Chariots of Fire, turning it into music.

The process has been successfully trialled at a pilot plant in China and a much bigger facility is now planned. Energy-dense liquids are vital to transport but are currently derived from oil, a fossil fuel, and transport produces about a quarter of the global carbon emissions driving climate change. Biofuels have been seen as possible replacement, but current biofuels compete with food production and have been blamed for driving up food prices. Using waste gases to create low-carbon liquid fuels would be a major advance in the battle against global warming if they could be made at low cost and large scale. Another company expects to be using different microbes to produce fuel from steel plants in Belgium and China in 2017. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) process uses bacteria to convert the waste gases into acetic acid - vinegar - then an engineered yeast to produce an oil. \u201cIt is quite an extraordinary story,\u201d said Prof Gregory Stephanopoulos, an expert in chemical engineering and biotechnology at MIT in the US. \u201cIt started just four to five years ago with a post-doctoral project funded by the US Energy Department. We are looking at a very fast timescale [of development],\u201d, he said. \u201cWe have pieced the system together into an integrated system, where you put gas in one end and get a liquid fuel out of the other end.\u201d The research was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The patents for the process are owned by MIT and have been licensed to GTL Biofuel Inc. Its pilot plant outside Shanghai ran successfully from September 2015 and a larger \u201csemi-commercial\u2019 demonstration plant, 20 times the size, is set to begin construction. This will test if the process can be scaled up and evaluate its costs and carbon footprint, said Prof Stephanopoulos: \u201cIt is one thing to do it on a scale of 1-2 litres in the lab, but a different story to move up 1,000 litres and then 20,000 litres in the demonstration plant.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line, if one is aiming at making fuels from renewable resources, is we need to look very carefully at low-cost feed stocks,\u201d he said. Garbage, along with manure and farm waste, is a particularly promising source of the \u201csyngas\u201d required, he said: \u201cThe volumes are staggering.\u201d Furthermore, using the gas from municipal waste reduces the carbon footprint of the liquid fuel, compared to exhaust gases from fossil fuel plants.  Prof Stephanopoulos said there are already thousands of biogas sites across Europe, but he argues the current practice of burning this gas to produce electricity is wasteful: \u201cIt is very costly and can only survive due to subsidies.\u201d Better, he said, is to use the gas to produce fuels that can replace gasoline or diesel. The MIT team are not the only people developing biotechnologies to turn exhaust gases into fuels. Like MIT, the US company Lanzatech uses microbes that can ferment gases into more complex molecules, a skill originally evolved so the bacteria could thrive at bubbling, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Lanzatech\u2019s processes aim to produce either fuel or chemicals useful in industry. The company is currently building commercial units in Belgium with ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steelmaker; in China with Capital Steel and in Taiwan with China Steel, with the first unit expected to enter service in 2017.

By Tuesday afternoon the English-language story denouncing the original article\u2019s censorship had itself been removed from the internet and replaced by the message: \u201cSorry, page not found.\u201d  Caixin\u2019s decision to take on China\u2019s censors comes less than a month after Xi, whose rise to power has seen a severe political tightening, made a high-profile visit to Chinese news outlets to demand their absolute loyalty.    Related: 'Love the party, protect the party': How Xi Jinping is bringing China's media to heel    During his tour of three Communist party controlled outlets, Xi instructed journalists that \u201cthey must love the party, protect the party, and closely align themselves with the party leadership in thought, politics and action\u201d. David Bandurski, an expert in Chinese journalism from the University of Hong Kong, said Caixin\u2019s decision to speak out after that visit was both bold and rare.  \u201cIt really speaks to a kind of desperation about the environment for journalism in China that they would come out and make an incident of this,\u201d he said. \u201c[It is] all the Ds: despair, depression, despondency.\u201d \u201cChinese media are under a lot of pressure right now.

Everybody is walking on glass now. It is such an intense environment of control that no one knows what is possible. No one can get their bearings. This is a real problem for journalists now.

The Canadian brings dynamism and energy to any environment, as witnessed by players, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose among them. They left Dubai breakfast meetings waxing lyrical about Pelley\u2019s plans.   Related: PGA Tour chief says golf should be controlled by one organisation    Pelley\u2019s enthusiasm is highly infectious. Professionally, he has entered the world of golf with the aim of questioning all that has gone before and all that may happen in the future. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that in the past,\u201d will never be an excuse against transition. It is hardly a leap of faith to suggest the PGA Tour is not entirely sure how to handle, or respond to, fresh circumstances across the Atlantic. That much was evidenced again on Sunday as Finchem raised the possibility of one all-encompassing brand to control professional golf in both the US and Europe. Needless to say, Finchem \u2013 who is not even expected to remain in office for much longer \u2013 does not have aspirations of watering down his own organisation; this looked an attempt to suggest the European Tour should stand aside. If it was a deliberate jab towards Pelley, suffice to say it has not worked. The message from Wentworth is one of full steam ahead. \u201cFrom my perspective, we are and will always be a members\u2019 organisation,\u201d Pelley told the Guardian. \u201cEvery decision we make, every thing we are involved in, we will always deal with the members first and foremost. If in fact there was a significant advantage to our members, to our players and this saw increased prize funds, increased playing opportunities, then I would imagine our members would want us to explore that. But I have not had a conversation with any of our members to date as such. \u201cI have only been in this job seven months, I am still listening and learning and what I have learnt is that we have a diversity that is very much our strength. We are golf\u2019s global tour; we play in 26 countries in five continents of the world, including the United States. We have quite a bit of diversity right now and what we are currently trying to do is build our organisation and build our tour for our members. Obviously, Mr Finchem has been in the industry a lot longer than I have so he is probably better equipped to talk about it but every decision we make will always be with our members at the forefront.\u201d Pressed on whether or not a combined tour would automatically make commercial sense, as Finchem intimated, Pelley added: \u201cI think golf is a little bit different to other sports, based on how many tours there are. We are obviously working with quite a few tours, we have sanctioned events with a number of organisations. Whether a consolidated tour is advantageous is something that would require significant exploration from all the tours and I\u2019m not sure that is something that would happen overnight. \u201cBased on the fact you already have tours fully operational, I don\u2019t think it is as simple as saying just: \u2018Let\u2019s all come together and it will be commercially viable.\u2019 You have to look at it from every member\u2019s perspective, that being the top-ranked player to the 200th. If there was a significant benefit to our members, it is something we would look at but it is not something we have explored to this point.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe we are already a global tour, with the diversity, the number of countries, where our members play. For us, we are in the process of making our tour a viable alternative to the tour in the United States. To do that, we will have to be aggressive. \u201cI think the PGA Tour have a very well-run, sophisticated business. I think they have done a terrific job. My focus is not on necessarily what transpires in the US but how we can provide significant playing benefits and opportunities, increased prize purses, for our members. Doing such and increasing the golf experience for our members is critical as we try to have our players play more on our tour.\u201d As Pelley will be acutely aware, talking the talk is one thing; delivering results is what will determine his European Tour legacy. For all he has breathed fresh life into an organisation which, being blunt, seemed guilty of laziness in the past, there will be onlookers who hope his grand plans are undermined by the harsh competition of this sponsorship world. \u201cChange is not going to happen overnight but it will happen,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThis is kind of our transitional year. I believe our tour will look different in 2017 and 2018. In terms of coming together as a consolidated tour, I wouldn\u2019t begin to entertain that without the players at the forefront of every single discussion. \u201cWe have already seen the Italian Open [purse] change, it will go to \u20ac7m next year. If this is a transitional year, 2017 will be different in terms of our prize purses, 2018 will grow upon that. I believe we have tremendous opportunity to show growth to our players.\u201d That means delving into markets not traditionally encountered by European golf. \u201cWe are in the midst of rebuilding our commercial value for our potential and current partners,\u201d Pelley said. \u201cGolf provides some opportunities that other sports don\u2019t. First and foremost, an ability to potentially play with guys in a pro-am or walk inside the ropes during the live rounds. That doesn\u2019t happen elsewhere \u2026 you are not on the pitch, you are not on the court in other sports.

Related: The chancellor must be honest about the budget\u2019s implications | Letters    Carney warned the politicians of the 20 richest countries that, despite seven years of money-printing and near-zero interest rates, the vigour of monetary stimulus has \u201cnot been matched by structural measures\u201d. Or listen to Mario Draghi, who warned that the European Central Bank\u2019s massive stimulus programme, announced last week, is all that stands in the way of \u201cdisastrous deflation\u201d. Or the Bank for International Settlements chief, Claudio Borio, who told investors last month that the entire economic model based on debt-fuelled growth and financial excess \u201cneeds to be abandoned\u201d. Central bankers are reticent creatures, so when they actually warn of doom it is best to listen. For Osborne, what it means is that the post-2008 recovery is nearly over \u2013 and that he has failed to achieve any of the structural changes needed to survive what is coming. To use his own hackneyed metaphor, the sun was indeed shining \u2013 more accurately an artificial sun powered by a $12tn global money splurge. But he failed to fix what needed fixing, which was not the roof, but the foundations of Britain\u2019s economy. Let\u2019s acknowledge one achievement. He was right to abandon his own austerity plan, halving the deficit over five years instead of pursuing the ludicrously ideological aim of eradicating it. But he did this too late, and the cost was two years of flatlining growth. However, the Osborne recovery was bought at a strategic cost: abandoning the plan to rebalance the UK economy. The original idea was to move growth away from consumption towards investment; to replace a trade deficit with a trade surplus, and wean British households off ever-rising property values. It didn\u2019t happen. Public spending on infrastructure is set to be less than half what it was in the last year of the Labour government. Business investment improved, but in the last half of 2015, it went negative. Meanwhile, trade is still in substantial deficit. Beyond the figures, the visual symbols of Osborne\u2019s structural failure can be seen in any big town or city: apartments being built to satisfy a speculative property boom; streets full of coffee-shop chains for graduates to work in; and employment agencies, where you can sign on for one of the 1.5m zero hours jobs created since Osborne took the helm. Not all of this rebalancing fiasco is down to the chancellor\u2019s failings. For the entire first term of the coalition, the Eurozone stagnated because of the ECB\u2019s refusal to engage in stimulus. You can bow and scrape to Narendra Modi or Xi Jinping all you like, but it cannot compensate for stagnation on your doorstep. But the chancellor had choices. He could have set up a national or regional investment bank, instead of trying to simply privatise Lloyds and RBS. There could have been a coherent industrial strategy; posing in the graphene labs at Manchester University did not produce one \u2013 neither will handing the exploitation of graphene research to China and Taiwan. Above all, he could have ordered the Bank of England to meet its own targets. The 2% target Osborne mandated has not been met since 2012, and yet the Bank is always administered a pat on the head and allowed to \u201clook through\u201d the risk of deflation. If this is the last quarter of Osborne\u2019s time in the Treasury, the sterile correspondence with the bank will stand testimony to a government dead behind the eyes when it comes to monetary policy. The problem is that now his choices are limited. Productivity growth is poor \u2013 and will not increase as long as we go on creating low-paid, precarious jobs. Debt stands at 78% of GDP. And though the banking system has been stabilised, it is still highly exposed to global risks. So here\u2019s the brave thing to do: steal Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s clothes. In the face of a global slowdown, with deflation and stagnation haunting the G20, Osborne should unleash a pre-emptive monetary and fiscal stimulus. If you applied John McDonnell\u2019s new fiscal rule, eradicating the current budget deficit only by 2021, you would have tens of billions more to spend over the next five years. Osborne on Sunday signalled instead that he was determined to achieve a surplus by 2020 \u2013 even as the economy slows down. It has been done before. The last time Britain faced the challenge of stagnation, needless austerity and geopolitical turmoil \u2013 in the mid-1930s \u2013 it was a Tory chancellor, Sir John Simon, who switched the taps of public spending back on to fund Neville Chamberlain\u2019s re-armament programme, outflanking Labour in the process. Osborne\u2019s desire to achieve surplus has always been driven by the need for shock-absorbers when the next global recession hits. But the slowdown is happening now, and the economic forecasters, EY Item Club, now says there is a 30% chance of a global recession. In the face of this, Osborne should design a Tory version of \u201cpeople\u2019s quantitative easing\u201d: since the ECB is now buying company debt and bank debt at rates that give away money for free, Osborne should signal the Bank of England to do likewise by raising its inflation target. The scale of the problem signalled by stagnant global growth, negative interest rates and financial turbulence means Britain needs a second stimulus \u2013 done this time in a way that moves us away from import dependence, precarious work and low pay.

The term, proposed by engineering professor Masahiro Mori in 1970, is normally applied to human responses to animations, robots or computer imagery that is so recognisably like us that any tiny difference is all the more noticeable, and disconcerting or even horrifying. It\u2019s territory in which JG Ballard seems to have spent a lot of time.   Related: High-Rise: Ballard's detached tone presents a steep moral challenge    Among the unsettling things about High-Rise, Ballard\u2019s 1975 novel, is how close it comes to our normal human experience, while skewing it. We can, for example, recognise that the setting has foundations in reality. We know about tower blocks: malfunctioning lifts, power outages; the petty inconveniences of life in the building seem all too familiar (and presumably had even greater resonance when the book was first published). The people, too, are instantly recognisable: 70s sophisticates, partygoers, social climbers. They are aspirational, middle-class, everyday. Ballard emphasises their normality by labelling them according to professional type \u2013 doctors, TV presenters, architects and lecturers. Partly, he shows them as respectable, successful people because there\u2019s a thrill of dissonance in observing the gulf between their working lives and their activities in the tower. Partly also, it\u2019s funny to see the thrusting middle classes living in their own mess. It\u2019s a joke that works especially well because it\u2019s at our expense. Ballard\u2019s readers are more likely than most to see something of themselves in those university-educated, chattering-class hooligans. He chose these people because he knew they would resonate most strongly with his intended victims: us.     JG Ballard outside his home in Shepperton, Surrey, in 1973, two years before High-Rise was published. Photograph: Alamy    We Ballardians, chatterers, readers of broadsheet newspapers and speculative literary fiction can\u2019t help but feel kinship with the inhabitants of High-Rise. He holds up a mirror. When Royal, the architect designer of the dysfunctional building, sprouts horns, so does our reflection. When everyone begins to run amok, it feels all the stranger because it is happening in our world. High-Rise contains enough that is (in a phrase Ballard repeats throughout the novel) \u201cmatter-of-fact\u201d to make the fantasy seem more lurid. The book\u2019s realism makes it uncanny. Perhaps \u201creality\u201d is the wrong word. Ballard often maintained he was \u201csurreal\u201d. \u201cThe essence of the surrealist imagination,\u201d he told a German magazine, \u201cis its ability to translate the apparent forms of the world, the outer forms, into inner ones, into mental forms. The surrealist painter doesn\u2019t seek to interpret the outer world as the classic schools of painting did \u2026 the surrealists recreate the outer world, completely in fact. And this was exactly the right method for SF, which needs something very similar. I used this concept of \u2018psychological space\u2019, and that again I found in surrealist paintings. I thought, that\u2019s exactly what I need in science fiction.\u201d That idea can clearly be applied to the strange conditions whereby the High-Rise building seems to have a mind of its own and the real is so out of kilter. Ballard was a surrealist. High-Rise is strange, disturbing and disconnected from most normal experience. Yet the novel draws much of its power from \u2018the real world\u2019 and historical fact. Ballard suggested it had direct inspirations. In 1978, he told Jon Savage (then a young punk journalist writing for Search &amp; Destroy) that he first had the idea for High-Rise thanks to \u201cthe most incredible triviality\u201d of the arguments that used to break out in a luxurious block of flats near his parents house in Victoria. There, Ballard said, the residents \u201cspent all their time bickering with one another, complaining about small things constantly: \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for the maintenance of the potted plant display on the 17th floor landing?\u2019\u201d He went on to tell a story of renting a flat on the Costa Brava (near, he enjoyed pointing out, to \u201cDali\u2019s place\u201d). Most of those in the resort were middle-class French: \u201cthey all had their bloody boats\u201d. And they, too, spent an \u201cenormous amount of their time\u201d bickering about nothing. One of the residents filled in the hours \u201cwith his back to the sea\u201d training his camera on Ballard\u2019s 12-storey apartment block.  Ballard at first assumed the man was a \u201cpeeping Tom\u201d because, he said \u201cmy girlfriend was walking around in the nude\u201d. But the author eventually realised the man was taking photos because of \u201can enormous amount of antagonism between the people of the lower floors and the people in the top\u201d. He was snapping people dropping cigarette ends and other rubbish from the upper floors on to lower balconies. The man announced this, eventually, by putting up a sign threatening to shame the litterbugs by pinning his photos on a noticeboard. \u201cWho would believe it? A holiday in this expensive block, and here\u2019s this guy so upset with the misbehaviour of those people on the 12th floor, that he stands with his back to the sea, with his camera, waiting to catch somebody in the act. Some guy who\u2019s probably a dentist, so obsessed with the sort of hostilities that are so easily provoked.\u201d So far, so High-Rise, and funny. But there\u2019s a crueller reality. The novel might have drawn some immediate inspiration from this bickering and rivalry on the Spanish Costa, but the violence and extremism had another source. Ballard had experienced confinement, isolation and societal breakdown in the second world war, when he was interned in a Shanghai prisoner of war camp. Physical imagery from this experience coloured his writing (the dried-up and discoloured swimming pools were something he saw in Shanghai). He had also seen the moral abdication of middle-class professionals \u2013 including his own parents \u2013 when cast adrift and thrust into a fight for survival. Possibly the most upsetting thing about the sense of the uncanny valley in JG Ballard\u2019s book isn\u2019t where the novel deviates from humanity. It\u2019s where there\u2019s a deeper reality behind the fantasy; where the apparently strange acts of his protagonists have historical precedent. Where the unlikely starts to feel all too familiar.

Since Xi Jinping became Communist party chief in late 2012, human rights lawyers, bloggers, feminists, journalists, academics and, most recently, labour activists have all been targeted in what appears to be a coordinated attempt to silence criticism.  Many observers believe Beijing\u2019s determination to bring its opponents to heel reflects growing concern among the leadership about the state of the Chinese economy.  On Wednesday the prime minister, Li Keqiang, admitted his government was grappling with \u201cdeep-seated\u201d economic problems but expressed optimism about China\u2019s longer-term prospects.  \u201cWe have full confidence in the bright future of China\u2019s economy. Our confidence is not built on flimsy ground. We feel so confident because we believe that as long as we stay on the course of reform and opening up, China\u2019s economy will not suffer a hard landing,\u201d Li said at a highly choreographed two-hour press conference at Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People.  \u201cThere are both difficulties and hopes for China\u2019s economy but \u2026 there are more hopes than difficulties,\u201d Li added.  However, there are mounting concerns about the potential for unrest as the economy loses steam after years of double-digit growth, and the number of strikes balloons.  Last weekend thousands of miners poured on to the streets in China\u2019s north-eastern rust belt to protest against unpaid wages, some holding placards that read: \u201cWe want to live, we want to eat.\u201d  Jiang, the outspoken government adviser, said he was troubled that as a result of censorship he was unable to express his concerns over free speech to the Chinese public. \u201cIn this aspect, there\u2019s still a lot of improvement needed in our country,\u201d he told the BBC.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian    \u201cYet this government\u2019s teacher shortage crisis is hitting maths acutely, with the Tories missing their target for recruiting maths teachers four years in a row.\u201d There has long been concern about the maths skills of UK children, who fare poorly in international tests. The latest Pisa tests, from 2013, put England in 26th place for maths, behind countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.   Related: A fifth of adults have forgotten how to do fractions or percentages    Last summer, 37% of the cohort failed to achieve a grade C or above in GCSE maths. Of those who were retaking \u2013 as required by the government \u2013 the figures were worse, with 64% failing to get the required C. Last weekend, the international education expert Andreas Schleicher told a conference that British schoolchildren were falling behind in maths because lessons in the subject were \u201ca mile wide and an inch deep\u201d. Schleicher, who is in charge of the Pisa tests, which are conducted on behalf of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said maths teaching in the UK was superficial because it focused on memorising facts, rather than concepts. The government is running an exchange programme with schools in Shanghai, where students are among the highest scoring in Pisa tests, in an attempt to improve maths education in England. Powell said: \u201cWith concerns from the OECD about the quality of the maths curriculum in schools and cuts to post-16 education, which have seen sixth-form colleges dropping Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) A-levels, it is hard to see how the Tories can achieve it under the current circumstances.\u201d   Related: A good memory is not a sign of education | Letters    A Department for Education spokesperson stressed the chancellor had announced a review and no final decisions had been made, but ministers are known to be concerned that far fewer students continue to study maths to 18 in England than in comparable countries. Du Sautoy welcomed the move: \u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic idea. Most nations already do this and recognise that maths is such an important skill \u2013 even if you are in the humanities.\u201d     Teaching unions questioned whether extra maths teachers would be found given the current recruitment crisis. Photograph: Janine Wiedel Photo Library/Alamy    He said one of the key problems was that the curriculum was boring and restricted. \u201cIt needs to be more ambitious and to challenge students a bit more. Maybe this will be the chance to do this.\u201d Teaching unions echoed Labour\u2019s concerns. Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cWe need to understand why the government\u2019s new reformed maths GCSE is not felt sufficient for the needs of young people. We would also question where the extra maths teachers would be found given the current recruitment crisis.\u201d  Smith carried out an inquiry into post-14 mathematics education for the government in 2003-04 and was previously director general of knowledge and innovation in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. He was unavailable for comment. Jill Stokoe, policy adviser for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said evidence showed that many students struggled with maths, even at GCSE level. \u201cI think we would put a lot of students off staying in sixth form if they had to carry on doing maths,\u201d she said. \u201cWe already know there\u2019s a shortage of maths teachers; who would be teaching all these extra students?\u201d Schleicher, speaking before the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai at the weekend, described what was lacking in maths teaching in the UK. \u201cOne of the things that we see when you look at high-performing education systems in maths, they typically have three things in the curriculum; one is rigour, the second is focus and the third is coherence. \u201cRigour means really having a high level of cognitive demand, and the UK is not doing well on it. Basically, the UK has a curriculum that is a mile wide and an inch deep, in the sense that a lot of the learning in maths is rather superficial.\u201d", "tags": ["Mathematics", "UK news", "Education", "Schools", "Budget 2016", "Budget", "Society", "Secondary schools", "Young people", "Students", "Further education", "Politics"], "publicationDate": "2016-03-16T19:28:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/16/taipei-taiwan-bike-sharing-environment-cycline-air-pollution", "sentences": ["Hangzhou, a city of 7 million people near Shanghai, leads Asia \u2013 if not the world \u2013 with more than 78,000 rental bikes."], "title": "Gearing up: how Taipei's bike-sharing program is transforming citizens' commute", "article": "Taipei\u2019s rental bikes are hard to miss. The Taiwanese capital has 7,264 of them, and their distinctive orange frames, yellow fenders and smiley face logo are nearly as common in some parts of town as the city\u2019s ubiquitous motor scooters. Last year, the city\u2019s bike rental program logged more than 20m trips, a stunning figure that becomes slightly less surprising when one considers that the bikes rent for as little as $0.15 per half hour from 222 self-service, card-activated storage lots.   Related: Return of the Bicycle Kingdom? How pavement cycling is transforming Taipei    It\u2019s hard to believe that, just four years ago, the program was on the edge of collapse, done in by a lack of rental docks and a scarcity of viable bike lanes in the city\u2019s choked streets. After a brief burst of enthusiasm, cycling became an unpopular method of transportation as citizens tried to save gas money during the global financial crisis. The city worked with Giant Manufacturing, the company that produces the bikes, to turn its bike rental program around. Giant upgraded its fleet to include mini locks, strong braking systems and bikes that change gears \u2013 a move that cut down on the number of repair jobs and broken bikes. For its part, the city added rental stations and bikes near metro stations and bus stops, areas where commuters who normally walk to work might be interested in a more convenient alternative. The city will continue this trend: by 2019, it plans to spend about $32m on more bikes and more places to rent them. It aims to open a total of 400 rental stations by 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient,\u201d says 35-year-old Taipei dance instructor Vivian Chen, a rental bike rider of three years. \u201cTake today,\u201d she continues, pulling out of a rental station in February. \u201cI\u2019d pay around 20 Taiwan dollars ($0.65) for the metro, but I think the bike rental costs less in the first half hour. And it would take me longer by metro because my destination isn\u2019t right on the train line. I would need to walk a ways to get there.\u201d     YouBike renters park after a ride in Taipei on March 16, 2016. Photograph: Ralph Jennings    Public relations and public transportation For Giant Manufacturing, which sells its bikes through 12,000 retailers in 50 countries, Taipei\u2019s rental program isn\u2019t a big money maker. It breaks even on the program, says Liu Li-chu, a spokesperson for Giant subsidiary YouBike. However, the program gives the company an opportunity to introduce potential customers to the benefits of cycling while building public good will toward its brand. Li-Chu, who is also the daughter of 82-year-old King Liu, Giant\u2019s founder and CEO, says that her father doesn\u2019t just make and sell bikes. \u201cHe rides and thinks other people should ride,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re putting good bikes in front of citizens and saying, \u2018Ride and see You\u2019ll fall in love. These bikes are addictive.\u2019\u201d For Taipei, building a loyal ridership was a challenge. One of the city\u2019s strategies was to offer the first half-hour free, a move that attracted masses of short-distance commuters in the cost-conscious city. Rentals doubled to 22m between 2013 and 2014, and city officials hope they would help to reduce air pollution and rush hour traffic congestion. \u201cThat initial thing about getting users in for free and getting them used to bikes \u2013 that was everything,\u201d said Anthony van Dyck, a Canadian expatriate in Taipei who follows YouBike as founder of an informational website for foreigners. \u201cThat and they never stopped adding bikes and adding stations.\u201d     Public bike rental programs have grown worldwide and can be found in nearly 1,000 cities by the end of 2015, says Bikesharingmap.com. Illustration: Russell and Alexandre Meddin of Bikesharingmap.com    The next struggle is traffic management. Many drivers in Taipei do not observe the designated bike lanes. On some streets, bikes compete for right-lane space with scooters, bus stops and double-parked cars. Sidewalks can be packed with pedestrians and shopping arcades. \u201cWe\u2019re now making plans for education and promotion work,\u201d said Liu Chia-yu, a division chief under the city\u2019s transportation department. \u201cFor bike riders, we\u2019re saying not to compete with pedestrians, and for people on foot, if you run into a bike give it some space.\u201d   Related: Where is the most cycle-friendly city in the world?    A growing solution Public bike rental programs are a growing solution for cities. According to Jack Oortwijn, editor of Netherlands-based magazine Bike Europe, between 600 and 800 cities currently have them. They have already changed commuting and tourism for European cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, where half the population gets to work by bike. Paris\u2019s bike program logged more than 200m rentals within seven years of its 2007 launch. Public bike programs are expanding across Asia, too. Japanese tourist mecca Kyoto has one, and Korean capital Seoul launched a system like Taipei\u2019s in late 2015. It plans to expand city-wide by 2020 with as many as 20,000 bikes. Meanwhile, numerous cities in China, including Beijing, also rent bikes to the public. Hangzhou, a city of 7 million people near Shanghai, leads Asia \u2013 if not the world \u2013 with more than 78,000 rental bikes. However, in many crowded cities \u2013 particularly in the developing world \u2013 bike programs are still an unaffordable luxury. Part of the problem also lies with the public image of bikes as a symbol of poverty, Oortwijn says. Research has shown that the image problem happens in industrialized or developing countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of priorities and awareness,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem with city councils is that they\u2019re not aware of the possibilities that bicycles can offer. In developing countries bicycles are regarded as the poor man\u2019s transport.

It said China\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors were continuing to deteriorate, hampering the government\u2019s efforts to tackle bad debts that had built up since the financial crisis. Recent plunges on the Shanghai stock market \u2013 down 17% so far this year \u2013 have undermined confidence in Beijing\u2019s ability to manage the crisis. If China\u2019s economy slowed by more than currently expected, the EIU said it would have a \u201chugely detrimental impact\u201d on emerging markets in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, as well as a \u201csevere knock-on effect\u201d on Europe and the US. There is also a \u201crising threat\u201d of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy, the report said, citing recent attacks in Paris, Lebanon, Turkey, and Indonesia, and the downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt. \u201cThe spread of IS [Isis] and its influence poses a dilemma for global policymakers, who are under pressure to intervene militarily to suppress the group in its strongholds in the Middle East [especially now that hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees are seeking sanctuary in Europe], but which in turn would risk reprisals in their home countries by radicalised IS sympathisers.\u201d The long-term stability of the eurozone was also in doubt, according to the report. It said Greece\u2019s future within the eurozone remained at risk if Athens failed to comply with the terms of its latest bailout. And if Greece left, other countries could follow, creating financial turmoil. \u201cCountries leaving the eurozone under duress would suffer large devaluations and be unable to service euro-denominated debts. In turn, banks would suffer huge losses in their sovereign bond portfolios, resulting in major disruption to the global financial system and plunging the world economy into recession,\u201d the EIU said. Talks between Greece and its creditors have been bogged down for months, delaying long-awaited negotiations on debt relief.  And Brexit, like Grexit, is another potential risk. The EIU said there was a low probability that Britain would vote to leave the EU in June, but there would be a high impact if it happened. \u201cIf Britain did leave the EU it would have negative ramifications for the UK \u2013 still the fifth biggest economy in the world, and whose exporters would struggle in the face of regulatory and tariff uncertainty, and whose position as a leading global financial services hub would be imperilled.\u201d The EU would also suffer, given the UK is one of its fastest-growing members and a supporter of \u201ctrade and services liberalisation\u201d, said the EIU.

The immense popularity of online videos of people climbing the world\u2019s tallest buildings, including the London Shard, had turned urban exploration, which traditionally involves surreptitiously exploring the off-limits corners of towns and cities, into an extreme sport, said academics from Southampton and Greenwich universities. Their comments come after a court barred four men from scaling structures in England and Wales after they posted online photographs and videos of themselves hanging 15 storeys above ground from a building in Lowestoft; climbing a crane in the town centre; and parachuting from a wind turbine.  A Suffolk police spokesman said officers had no alternative but to take action as they could have fallen and not only killed themselves but passersby. \u201cEvidence gathered by police showed they had repeatedly carried out the activity and had been posting footage on the internet,\u201d he added. Dr Bradley Garrett, a cultural geographer at Southampton University, said the case illustrated how a younger generation of \u201curbex\u201d enthusiasts compete for attention and credibility online by combining their adventures with riskier activities such as base jumping, where people parachute from structures, and parkour, which involves navigating urban spaces by climbing, jumping, balancing and running through buildings.         Parkour chase in Casino Royale \u2013 video    Garrett, who penetrated London\u2019s secret underground tunnels and scaled the Shard while researching his PhD on urban explorers, said: \u201cThe community has changed drastically. A lot of these kids are putting themselves at greater risk to gain credibility on social media channels. There have been an increased number of deaths in the urban exploration community worldwide in the pastfew years and that\u2019s gone hand in hand with the increased desire to publish these exploits on social media.\u201d His views are shared by Theo Kindynis, doctoral candidate at the University of Greenwich, said: \u201cIf you look at what these kids [in Lowestoft] were actually doing it\u2019s this new offshoot of urban exploration which seems to be all about internet fame and making a name for themselves. The problem with these guys is not only was what they were doing so reckless they were publicising it flagrantly online.\u201d Kindynis said these riskier practices had been popularised in recent years by viral videos of climbers such as the Russian duo Vadim Makhorov and Vitality Rasklov, known as On The Roofs, and British \u201cprofessional adventurer\u201d James Kingston. These typically showed them scaling an under-construction skyscraper, tower or crane before dangling their legs or hanging their entire bodies, without safety equipment, from a concrete or steel precipice, he added.  One of On The Roof\u2019s videos, which shows them ascending the 632-metre-high (2,073 ft) Shanghai Tower, then high-fiving one another while balancing on a crane arm, has more than 50m views on YouTube. Matthew Adams, one of the four urban explorers found guilty at Lowestoft magistrates court last week of causing alarm and distress to residents, said social media had pushed people more into \u201cthe stunts and hanging while climbing rather than just photographing the views\u201d while exploring. Adams, who publishes photographs and videos of his climbs on his Facebook page, Unexposed Explorations, said social media was \u201ca massive part\u201d of his practice but denied this was his sole motivation. \u201cThat might look like I\u2019m just doing it for attention but I consider myself an artist,\u201d said Adams, who studied art and photography at Lowestoft College.

The order also prevents them going beyond safety barriers on any building and bans them from parachuting off any structure without permission from the owner.  Adams said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite over the top for a first offence and when you\u2019re pleading guilty. We were [at St Peter\u2019s Court building in Lowestoft] for three hours uninterrupted by anyone, so no one could have felt that alarmed or distressed.\u201d Bradley Garrett, who last year received a conditional discharge for conspiring to commit criminal damage during sorties into disused London Underground tunnels and stations such as Aldwych, condemned the penalty imposed on Adams and his friends, warning it would provoke riskier behaviour rather than act as a deterrent.  \u201cThe community will be much more militant \u2026 if we start clamping down,\u201d he said. \u201cI guarantee that locks will start coming off, windows will be broken.

Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen for Observer Food Monthly    \u201cMy family was very science-focused, and it never occurred to me to work in hospitality,\u201d says Amandine Chaignot, who studied pharmacy before retraining as a chef. \u201cI put on my whites for the first time on the day France won the World Cup: 12 July 1998.\u201d Since then, she has worked with Alain Ducasse and Christopher Hache, and at the Ritz in London and Le Meurice in Paris. Now she has been appointed executive chef at the Rosewood, in Holborn. Her menu for the hotel\u2019s glitzy Mirror Room is highly seasonal with a deft touch. \u201cMale chefs can be quite competitive about who has the richest sauces,\u201d she says. \u201cI have another way of cooking. Hopefully it\u2019s refined but it\u2019s also relaxed, and even though the food can be quite complex, I think it is easy to understand.\u201d ECMirror Room, Rosewood London, High Holborn, London WC1V 7EN 8: Alain Passard He is the still-curly-haired and choirboy-faced godfather of the vegetable: the triple-Michelin-star chef who figure-headed the movement to taking garnish centre stage. Alain Passard still cooks most days at L\u2019Arp\u00e8ge, 30 years after taking over from mentor Alain Senderens; 20 after gaining his third star, and now approaching his own 60th birthday on 4 August. \u201cI have had two lives,\u201d he says. \u201cFifteen years mostly cooking with meat and 15 years with vegetables.\u201d Cited by Momofuku\u2019s David Chang as \u201cthe most important chef ever\u201d and by David Kinch of California\u2019s Manresa as \u201cthe only chef I\u2019ve ever met that I can unequivocally call a true artist\u201d, Passard has schooled Pascal Barbot of L\u2019Astrance, Bertrand Gr\u00e9baut of Septime, and \u2013 for a few weeks before he was fired \u2013 Magnus Nilsson of F\u00e4viken. Vegetable dishes had shone before but Passard has made eating his menu an almost spiritual experience (he is also evangelical about farming, producing 40 tonnes of organic food a year from three potagers where ploughs are drawn by donkey). The switch came during the mad cow crisis, he says. He felt he had accomplished all he could with his menu, he was \u201dready to cook with colours\u201d. Ask about his favourite vegetables and he enters a sort of rapture: \u201cIn the spring,\u201d he says, \u201cperhaps peas are my favourite \u2026 for me, it\u2019s green caviar. In autumn and winter, celeriac is my crystal ball.\u201d (He tends to cook and talk in rhapsody.) \u201cIt\u2019s fabulous to teach my team how to cook this way,\u201d he says, \u201chow to smell and what seasons mean. My favourite dish, for example, is a vegetable harlequin. At first it involved 12 elements. Today, there are only three. I try to be more precise.\u201d Be warned, stellar three-star precision does not come cheap: the dejeuner des jardiniers menu is \u20ac140, the terre et mer, \u20ac370. On value for money, I ask Magnus Nilsson: \u201cOn my last day in France, after leaving L\u2019Astrance [where he worked with Barbot],\u201d he says, \u201cI had the unexpected pleasure of receiving my holiday pay. I packed my belongings in three suitcases, lugged them to L\u2019Arp\u00e8ge (I lived close by) and gave them the money \u2013 about \u20ac1,400 \u2013 in an envelope and asked them to make me lunch. It was one of those defining meals, not just because the food was fantastic and I had great old burgundy but because of all the circumstances around it. When the meal was over, I asked them to order me a taxi and went straight to the airport to leave for Sweden.\u201d AJ 9: The Quality Chop House\u2019s mince on toast The Quality Chop House\u2019s confit potatoes are among the UK\u2019s most Instagrammed dishes (and rightly so: they\u2019re almost as good to look at as to eat , but I can\u2019t fathom why another ever-present on Shaun Searley\u2019s otherwise regularly changing menu doesn\u2019t come in for similar levels of adoration. Sure, the Chop\u2019s take on humble mince on toast may not have quite the come-hither allure as the spuds, but this is like no mince you\u2019ve had before, the most insanely meaty mince imaginable, and hugely rich, thanks to proper dripping; it\u2019s the sort of thing mythical grannies made in battered cast-iron pans. A side of Searley\u2019s spuds wouldn\u2019t go amiss, but I can\u2019t think of many better ways to spend \u00a314.50 on lunch. BG88-94 Farringdon Rd, London EC1R 3EA 10: Heston\u2019s mechanical sweet shop     Fat Duck Sweet Trolley. Photograph: Levon Biss for Observer Food Monthly    In the previous incarnation of the Fat Duck, before the recent \u00a32.5m refurbishment of its home in Bray, the meal would end with a simple bag of sweets. Well, not that simple: the apple pie caramel had an edible wrapper and one of the petit fours took the form of a playing card. Since the restaurant reopened Heston Blumenthal has pushed this idea to an actual sweet shop. When the new \u00a3255 tasting menu draws to a close, a trolley arrives bearing a doll\u2019s house that resembles the Fat Duck itself. It opens to reveal an old-fashioned dispenser, activated by a personalised coin received earlier in the meal. This dazzling contrivance, complete with a replica of Blumenthal\u2019s boyhood bedroom and a chimney that puffs smoke, cost \u00a3150,000 to build. As Blumenthal says: \u201cIt would have been easier to buy a full-size sweet shop, and it\u2019s probably around the same price.\u201d The detail was inspired by dolls houses on display in Windsor Castle, and his characteristically perfectionist approach \u201cprobably drove everyone involved slightly bonkers\u201d. The floorboards and roof tiles were handmade and the floors hand-laid \u201cboard by board like they would be in a life-sized house. It\u2019s even got real roofing lead surrounding the chimney\u201d. Blumenthal also notes the tiny jars of sweets in the window, a miniature replica of his glasses and \u201cthe smallest lightbulbs in the world\u201d illuminating the two rooms. The reason for the elaborate finale? \u201cI wanted to amplify the interactive involvement that guests experience throughout their time at the Fat Duck,\u201d says Blumenthal. \u201cIt\u2019s all based on the metaphor of feeling like a kid in a sweet shop, which I want everyone leaving the restaurant to feel.\u201d KFthefatduck.co.uk 11: Alison Roman Now senior food editor at Buzzfeed, Roman worked at US food magazine Bon Appetit for four years where her recipes became something to look forward to: well written, with an innate understanding of flavour. And if you make her terrific rhubarb almond cake, it will be no surprise to find out that \u2013 \u201cafter leaving college a little early to go cut marshmallows for a living\u201d \u2013 she spent years working as a pastry chef in LA, San Francisco and at Momofuku Milk Bar in New York. She\u2019s just signed a two-book deal with Random House US with the first, Dining In, scheduled for autumn 2017. SM 12: Crepe Suzette at the Ritz  One of the grandest set pieces of restaurant theatre in one of London\u2019s grandest rooms. You are sitting with a friend at the Ritz. You may have had, say, John Williams\u2019s brilliant langoustine in bisque with squid ink, partridge cooked in a pot with black truffles, perhaps a glass of pinot noir. Yet there is still something mysteriously missing. You watch as an elegant trolley is wheeled to a neighbouring table, a tin-lined copper pan taken out. There are vessels of orange juice, citrus rind in syrup, a bottle of Grand Marnier. On a plate sit four folded pancakes like monogrammed handkerchiefs. Devid Isabella sprinkles sugar from high into the hot pan, stirs quickly, adds butter. The rarefied air is scented with caramel. A splash of orange. The fragrance now like making marmalade. Crepes are added, unfolded, refolded, kept almost crisp. Then whoosh! The spirit and room lights with stuttering purple flame. Two plates are laid, pancakes added, sauce spooned, and a scoop of vanilla-flecked ice cream. Suddenly you know what you\u2019re missing is a taste of history: the Ritz\u2019s crepes Suzette served here since 1906. Inspired, you switch your order. I\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having, you say. AJ 13: Uncover booking app Tired of not being able to get into fashionable restaurants at short notice? Uncover promises a solution: an app that lets you check availability and book last-minute with a couple of taps. Uber, but for restaurants. You get access, Uncover takes a cut, and in exchange for keeping some tables free, restaurants get to welcome well-heeled, high-spending users. The company has now been bought by Velocity, another app which lets you pay on your phone without all that faff involving card machines. Later this month, the combined app is re-launching as Velocity 2.0, which will handle everything from choosing a restaurant to the tip. \u201cOur users spend on average 14% more than regular customers,\u201d says Alex MacDonald, Velocity\u2019s co-founder, \u201cso the offer to the restaurants is clear.\u201d The app will also have a version for corporate accounts, which will integrate with company expense systems. ECvelocityapp.com 14: Guest chefs     Bertrand Gr\u00e9baut and James Lowe at Lyle\u2019s in Shoreditch, London. Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen for Observer Food Monthly    James Lowe is at the pass with Septime\u2019s Bertrand Gr\u00e9baut . They work quietly, intently. They smile and tweak a plate or two. They are simpatico. There is a synergy. You\u2019d think they had worked together in Paris for months not a couple of days as part of Lowe\u2019s Guest Series at Lyle\u2019s in east London. There is a lot of guest cheffing around, it is officially A Thing. From Northcote\u2019s Obsession line-up in Lancashire to the Seahorse in Devon and Nathan Outlaw in Cornwall. But it is London where it\u2019s really taken hold. Isaac McHale\u2019s Clove Club hosted Jorge Vallejo from Mexico City in September last year, and Robin Gill from the Dairy has a guest-chef-driven Bloodshot Supper Club once a month, kicking off at a nocturnal 1am. Even venerable J Sheekey has a series with female cooks including Olia Hercules and Anna Jones starting soon. Both McHale and Lowe were part of February\u2019s Gelinaz extravaganza, when 16 chefs from the UK and Europe descended on their kitchens for a night, but you sense Lowe is more comfortable with less gaudy events, something perhaps more lasting and meaningful. \u201cEvery month, we get someone in who uses new techniques, style, ingredients,\u201d he says. \u201cI love seeing how people work, they way they think and approach something. Before Lyle\u2019s, I used to travel all over to eat at restaurants, in the States, Spain, France, Denmark. Sometimes I\u2019d fly somewhere just for a lunch on a day off! Since we opened, I haven\u2019t really done that.\u201d Asked for his favourite moments of the Guest Series, he cites getting up at 7am to drive to Brighton to get seawater, on to Lewes for vegetables, then Kent for fruit and Lincolnshire for 35kg of wild eel. \u201cSpending the next 12 hours filleting them and finishing at 4am,\u201d he says, \u201cwas one of the most intense experiences I\u2019ve had.\u201d AJ theguestseries.com 15: Laurie Colwin\u2019s Home Cooking  An American novelist and short story writer who died in 1992, at the age of 48, might seem an unlikely cult figure. But, with no less than Nigella a fan \u2013 you may have spotted her reading from Colwin\u2019s Home Cooking on Simply Nigella \u2013 that is what she has become. Unlike today\u2019s cookbooks, Home Cooking and More Home Cooking are slim paperbacks without photos. Recipes are woven into the text like anecdotes (\u201cI ate eggplant constantly: with garlic and honey, with spaghetti, with fried onions and Chinese plum sauce\u201d might be all you get). She encourages getting it wrong, with Stuffed Breast of Veal: A Bad Idea the ominous title of one essay. But the joy of reading Colwin is as much in the way she leaves you feeling hungry and inspired, amused and uplifted as in the recipes. Although her fried chicken is pretty definitive. SM 16: Wine on tap For years it was simple: if a pub was selling wine out of a tap, it was best to stick to beer. Even when the range wasn\u2019t limited to \u201cmedium\u201d, \u201cdry\u201d or \u201csweet\u201d, this was a serving method that seemed to make good wines bad, and bad wines undrinkable. Over the past year, however, taps have been creeping back into some of London\u2019s best wine-led bars and restaurants, from Michael and Charlotte Sager-Wilde\u2019s California specialist Mission in Bethnal Green, to the branches of the consistently excellent Vinoteca group. This isn\u2019t a cost-cutting exercise: the wines are seriously good, and actually taste fresher than they would from a bottle. DW 17: Top restaurants in art galleries These days, it\u2019s not enough for high-end galleries to merely offer white walls and a gift shop: they also need a deluxe restaurant on site with a big-name chef at the helm. This is true of the new Gagosian gallery in Mayfair. Soon after the 18,000-sq-ft space opened off Berkeley Square last September, it was announced that River Cafe owner Ruth Rogers would be taking over the ground floor. It must have been an attractive offer: despite its popularity, the River Cafe hasn\u2019t branched out since it opened in Hammersmith three decades ago. This venture, led by in-house chefs Sian Owen and Joseph Trivelli, will open next year. Mark Hix is less averse to diversifying: he has launched seven new restaurants since his Oyster &amp; Chop House appeared in Farringdon in 2008. Now he\u2019s taken charge of Pharmacy 2 at Damien Hirst\u2019s Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall. It revives the medical theme of Hirst\u2019s original restaurant in Notting Hill, with surgical equipment on display and giant polyurethane pills for seats. This \u2013 along with the recently opened Anthony Demetre restaurant, Osteria, at the Barbican \u2013 goes to show just how magnetic the food world has become. KF 18: Coracle fishing     Welsh coracle fishermen in Camarthen, Wales. Photograph: Levon Biss for Observer Food monthly    When mankind first took to the water, it is likely they did so in a coracle. A small, round boat constructed by stretching waterproof fabric around a bent wood frame, coracles are still used to fish for salmon and sea trout on the rivers of Wales, and March sees the start of the season. Fishing is done in darkness when there is little or no moon so canny fish can\u2019t see the nets. Fishermen gather on the riverbank, each carrying their coracle on their back, resembling giant black beetles. Working in pairs, they steer their coracles downstream close to the bank with a net stretched between them. The net is only 18-inches deep so the salmon have a sporting chance and the pickings are not exactly rich. But this ancient tradition is in mortal danger. There is only one coracle maker and six pairs of fishermen on the River Towy, the main coracle fishing river in Wales, but it seems the final nail will be hammered into the coffin with the heavy hand of legislation. In the name of conservation, the Environment Agency is pushing for a blanket ban on all salmon fishing with nets. After millennia of coracle fishing, 2016 may be its last season ever. KH 19: The Heron Were someone to ask you where to go for a great Thai meal in London, you might say Smoking Goat or Som Saa. What you might not \u2013 but should \u2013 suggest is a restaurant in the basement of an unassuming pub which is tucked off the distinctly unfashionable Sussex Gardens in Paddington. It\u2019s not hip, it\u2019s not a pop up and yes, you can book. And when your waiter asks you how spicy you\u2019d like your order, know that this is not a challenge. \u201cSlightly spicy\u201d actually means plenty hot. A whole section of the menu is devoted to salads such as som tam and larb enhanced by salted crab or minced catfish. Even the cashew salad is great: salty nuts with slim slices of bird\u2019s eye chilli, red onion and teeny refreshing wedges of lime. SM1 Norfolk Crescent, London W2 2DN 20: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt  Managing culinary editor of Serious Eats, J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2018s scientific background makes him a perfect guide to the kitchen\u2019s hard questions. Don\u2019t know how to keep the structure of apple slices in pies, or the difference between temperature and heat? L\u00f3pez-Alt does. He\u2019s cooked steak on the bone, off the bone, from chilled, at room temperature, salted immediately before cooking, hours before cooking, with a dozen other variables, so you can get your grill right first time, to your taste. His relaxed, easy way with words extends to his view of food \u2013 from his 2015 Thanksgiving blog: \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s only food \u2026 so long as it\u2019s gotten friends and family to gather around the table, it\u2019s done its job.\u201d That said, his book The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, is mind-bogglingly detailed and rewarding. HO\u2019N 21: Freddie Janssen\u2019s F.A.T sandwiches     Freddie Janssen. Photograph: Rebecca Reid / Evening Standard / eyevine    Twice a month you\u2019ll find Freddie Janssen at Druid Street market, in London\u2019s Bermondsey, serving up her F.A.T. sandwiches to a dedicated following. Her mainstays have been a classic grilled cheese with cucumber dill pickle and, in a twist on the cheese\u2019n\u2019pickle theme, kimchi and stilton. This year, the menu will change every month, with occasional specials such as the Ultimate Meatball (pork and fennel meatballs with pickled fennel and walnut and rocket pesto) joined by a buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (brined overnight in pickle juice) with a pickled jalapeno slaw and kimchi hot sauce mayo. But don\u2019t worry: the cheese sandwiches will be back.  With a base like Druid Street, sourcing ingredients is easy: bread and burger buns for the sandwiches are from St John, cheese is from Neal\u2019s Yard and the pickles are all made in her Clapton kitchen. Janssen moved to London from Holland in 2008 and worked in advertising before becoming marketing manager of Shoreditch restaurant Lyle\u2019s. She founded F.A.T., a pop-up cafe, supper club and purveyor of pickles in 2009, but what started as a hobby has snowballed. Her first cookbook, the aptly named Pickled, is published next month. SMfffaaattt.com 22: Breakfast at Dandy cafe  Last summer, Andy Leitch and Dan Wilson removed 10 tonnes of rubbish from two shipping containers, in which they created their ideal neighbourhood restaurant. Raw timber fit-out? Yes. Good coffee, cheery atmosphere, corrugated plastic roof that amplifies the rain? Check, check, check. Small plates? Of course. Minimal intervention wines? Yes, three by the glass: red, white and \u201cweird\u201d. So far, so good, so Hackney. It\u2019s weekend brunch where the magic happens; simple, different, some of the best around. A tiny lamb cutlet where others would serve bacon; crab omelette folded round a rainbow of radish wafers; the season\u2019s first rhubarb, caramelised and sandwiched in brioche. The tall man cooking looks familiar? It\u2019s Alt-J\u2019s Gus Unger-Hamilton, the third Dandy, turning his hand to frying eggs (crisp frill underneath, set whites, yolks that burst soon as you look at them \u2013 five stars). No big deal, just friends, good at what they do, quietly getting on with it. HO\u2019N9-15 Helmsley Place, London E8 23: Moonshine  It\u2019s the romance of American moonshine that has long set it apart from more humdrum homemade drinks: introduced by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled in the Appalachians in the late 18th century, the term principally refers to an un-aged whiskey made from corn mash, and often distilled illegally, at night, to avoid detection. Making moonshine at home is still illegal (due to a heady combination of tax matters and lead-poisoning issues), but shifting licensing laws have led to a rise in small-batch distilleries offering un-aged white whiskey, with distillers springing up in the hooch heartland of Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as in more far-flung corners of the US such as the Pacific north west, New England and California. The most well-known brand is Ole Smoky, the first moonshine to be sold in Walmart, but as with beer, gin and bourbon, white whiskey is becoming a niche market, with the focus on innovative and distinguished flavours \u2013 Kings County Distillery in New York, for example, produces a moonshine Jim Murray\u2019s Whisky Bible describes as \u201cabsolutely spot-on corn whiskey\u201d, noting its \u201csweet, clean berry-fruit\u201d flavour and awarding it a 92-point score. In truth the moonshine revival has been rumbling since the late 1990s, but in recent years the market has gathered pace: US sales grew to $46m in 2014 \u2014 from just $5m in 2011, and with Jack Daniel\u2019s and Jim Beam venturing into un-aged white whiskey, moonshine might finally have to get used to the limelight. LB 24: Martin Parr\u2019s Real Food Twenty years ago Parr\u2019s British Food series highlighted the difference between glossy, aspirational food porn and what was on most people\u2019s plates. That meant harshly lit photographs of sliced white bread, salads of lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes, with a dollop of Branston pickle on the side, as well as tough-looking cakes from an era long before Bake Off. We are all food lovers now, of course, years of bestselling cookbooks, celebrity chefs and affordable foreign travel mean we\u2019re clued up about sourdough, know the difference between za\u2019atar and ras el hanout, and can rustle up a show-stopping bake or two. At least that\u2019s what we tell the world on our Instagram feeds. A perfect time, then for Phaidon to publish an anthology of Parr\u2019s food images, drawn from his archive. (The pigeon eyeing up a dinner of discarded fried chicken is a particular favourite.) There\u2019s also a terrific introduction from St John\u2019s Fergus Henderson, who warns of the dangers of a \u201ctwo-tier food situation\u201d, of a split between the world of \u201cgood meat from animals treated well when alive\u201d and supermarkets selling \u201canonymous pink meat in plastic\u201d. GG 25: The Dusty Knuckle Bakery  For almost two years, the founders of the then fledgling bakery and social enterprise the Dusty Knuckle \u2013 Max Tobias, Rebecca Oliver and Daisy Terry \u2013 would get up at 5am every Saturday. They\u2019d then bake the dough they\u2019d made at Tobias\u2019s flat in the pizza oven of an obliging local restaurant, selling it to a handful of wholesale customers. Fast-forward to October 2014 and, after successful applications for grants and a competition to occupy a shipping container in a Hackney car park, they were trading full-time. The bakery\u2019s menu is short but perfectly thought out: a small range of sourdough breads, an Italian puff pastry filled with cr\u00e8me patissiere and apple, a sticky bun, and freshly made sandwiches filled with things like burnt aubergine, herb salads, tahini and harissa at lunchtime. Its social enterprise side came via Tobias\u2019s frustration with his previous work: managing a gang prevention programme in east London. \u201cI wanted to develop something with a continued impact, where [young people] could feel they were developing their independence, as opposed to a kind of dependence on services that were always short term and poorly funded.\u201d Their aim is to work with young offenders, early school leavers and the long-term unemployed. That means training and working in the bakery but also holding workshops at youth centres and referral units and, crucially, helping with skills that are vital to employment, such as timekeeping or communicating effectively. \u201cIt all seemed fairly straightforward: start a bakery, employ the kids and that\u2019d be that,\u201d says Tobias. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a little bit more complicated.\u201d SMAbbott Street car park, Kingsland Road, London E8 3DP 26: Professional barista apprenticeship \u201cThe goal is to take a young unemployed person who may know nothing about coffee on day one, and within a year make them one of the highly trained baristas in the country.\u201d So says Ben Szobody, of the Professional Barista Apprenticeship programme that recently took its second intake of 16-24 year olds, each previously out of work and education, and keen to learn. The free, government-funded programme \u2013 the first of its kind in the UK \u2013 is run by Szobody and the charity wing of Brighton-based baptist One Church, in conjunction with a nearby secondary school. Apprentices learn the minutiae of speciality coffee from preparing the perfect espresso, to honing sensory skills, to the business of taking a bean from plant of origin to shiny white cup. Throughout the year-long course, they are placed on paid apprenticeships in one of Brighton\u2019s many independent coffee shops, including Small Batch, whose trainer Laura Holmes is the course\u2019s principal teacher. DH  27: London Union What do Jamie, Nigella and Yotam have in common? Nope, not the first-name-recognition thing. Add Polpo\u2019s Russell Norman, Soho House head honcho Nick Jones and top restaurant critics Giles Coren and Marina O\u2019Loughlin, and you\u2019ve got just a few of the founding investors of London Union, an ambitious plan to turn derelict corners of the city into street-food markets. It\u2019s the brainchild of bar entrepreneur, restaurateur and street-food enthusiast Jonathan Downey and his business partner, Leon co-founder and former school dinners tsar Henry Dimbleby. And you wouldn\u2019t bet against them pulling it off: they have form at this kind of thing with their successful Street Feast empire, which showcases the street-food scene at huge venues in London\u2019s Dalston, Shoreditch and Canada Water \u2013 nearly 6,000 went through the doors of the latter site over the last weekend of January, making Hawker House one of the UK\u2019s most visited dining venues. At the core of the new venture is an even more ambitious project: a new super-market for central London (Smithfield has been touted as one possible site) to usurp Borough and rival the likes of Barcelona\u2019s Boqueria in global reputation. BG  28: The new wave of women bakers     Sarah Lemke at De Superette in Gent, Brussels. Photograph: Joanna van Mulder for Observer Food Monthly    Customers travel from all over to eat the magnificent bread made by Sarah Lemke and her all-female team of bakers at De Superette in the Belgian city of Ghent. And like Laura Hart of Hart\u2019s Bakery in Bristol, Bridget Hugo at London\u2019s Bread Bread, and Carol Choi of Mirabelle in Copenhagen, they\u2019re quietly proving that women can master more than cakes. \u201cHalf of my bread team is female,\u201d confirms Chad Robertson, co-owner of San Francisco\u2019s Tartine bakery. \u201cThey are all amazingly talented, any of them are capable of leading.\u201d More and more women are approaching Laura Hart at her booming bakery, looking to make bread for a living. \u201cPerhaps the shift from mass production to smaller artisan bakeries is more appealing to women,\u201d she says. \u201cBy slowing down our baking rhythms, we don\u2019t need to work through the night, and we get to see our customers enjoying what we\u2019ve made.\u201d Breadmaking as a craft that blends technique and intuition does have more charm than the mechanised drudgery of Chorleywood-style production, and the practice of leaving sourdough to ferment slowly overnight means that antisocial night shifts can be replaced by very early starts. The physicality of the job can be a pro or a con, depending on who you are. Hauling 25kg bags of flour and plunging wooden peels into scorching ovens at 5am isn\u2019t for everyone, but it\u2019s here these women have found their calling, and mastered it. \u201cWe  have so much fun,\u201d says Lemke. \u201cWe get covered in flour, light fires. If you love it, you love it, it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d ZN  29: Lunch at Books for Cooks My favourite eating space in London is Books for Cooks in Notting Hill. I call it a \u201cspace\u201d because it is a strange and delightful mixture of bookshop, cafe (Eric Treuille, the owner, calls it a canteen) and community centre. It was launched in 1983 by Heidi Lascelles, and later run by the late Clarissa Dixon Wright of Two Fat Ladies fame. Eric took over 13 years ago, after he met his wife while browsing the thousands of cookbooks that line the walls. He has made it his own \u2013 with his charismatic personality and astonishingly cheap meals (\u00a35 for two courses, \u00a37 for three), prepared from a different book (or books) from his shelves every day. I have been coming here for 10 years, sometimes every day of the working week. At first, I ate by myself, hidden behind a book or a newspaper. Eventually, despite myself, I started talking to other lone souls. They were, on the whole, an interesting bunch \u2013 singers, psychologists, poets, a few market traders, other restaurateurs \u2013 and a host of anonymous others. Eventually, Eric installed a six-seat table for people coming by themselves and we have formed a community of diners. We squabble and fall out, we laugh and gossip, and comfort each other. Eric is usually there (with sidekicks Marilu and Liv) ribbing us or making jokes as his remarkable staff cook and serve. What you see on the blackboard, three courses, is what you get until it runs out (which it can do by 1pm). Eric is a friend, he catered my wedding, my last book launch, and my 60th birthday. I can\u2019t imagine how diminished my life would be if the place ever closed. So what do you get to eat? Recent favourites have included lamb shoulder with pommes dauphinoise, brisket with polenta and coriander, and salt cod and chorizo \u2013 but you never know what you\u2019re going to get. All you know is that it will be delicious (particularly the cakes), ridiculously cheap and displaying hospitality that comes from the heart, not from the profit motive. TL4 Blenheim Crescent, London W11 1NN 30: Deliciously Stella It was inevitable that the world of healthy eaters on Instagram would inspire a backlash. In May last year, 27-year-old Bella Younger started Deliciously Stella, a play on Ella Woodward\u2019s Deliciously Ella account. Where Ella recommends juices and kale, Stella posts shots of (Creme) eggs with avocado on toast, her \u201cFab abs\u201d \u2013 Fab lollies strapped to her stomach \u2013 and tote bags emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cYou can\u2019t milk an almond.\u201d She\u2019s working on a stand-up show too. \u201cThe only problem is people now expect me to be Stella all the time,\u201d Younger says. \u201cThey see me in the shops and ask why I\u2019m not carrying a Lucozade.\u201d EC 31: Black Axe Mangal     Chef Lee Tiernan at Black Axe Mangal in Islington, London. Photograph: Adrian Lourie / Evening Standard / eyevine    After 10 years with the St John group, chef Lee Tiernan started his Black Axe Mangal as a pop-up in Copenhagen before moving to a permanent site on Highbury Corner at the end of last year. It\u2019s since won raves for its \u201cmetal and mangal\u201d offering, matching loud music with a short, punchy, meat-driven menu in a 33-cover space. Few parts of the animal are spared: think hearts, livers, tails and noses, all liberally seasoned and cooked at high heat. Nor is Tiernan afraid to borrow from his friends: his spiced mutton is made with the spice mix from Danny Bowien\u2019s Mission Chinese, and the flatbread recipe is inspired by Tartine in San Francisco. EC156 Canonbury Road, London N1 2UP 32: Neil Broomfield : from police to pies When Neil Broomfield started selling homemade pies in 2007, he had to fit it in around his day job as a policeman. He baked his wares in a room above the family deli and sold them at farmers\u2019 markets on his days off from keeping the peace. This double life lasted four years, until the awards started piling up and the Great North Pie Co became his full-time concern. Last year, at the British Pie Awards, he took prizes in four categories and his Goosnargh chicken, mushroom and English mustard cream pie was voted best in Britain. If you don\u2019t live in the Manchester area, Great North pies are available at Selfridges and dukeshillham.co.uk. KF 33: 2015 French vintage According to the \u201crule of five\u201d, France always produces a great vintage in years divisible by five. By all accounts, the rule has held for 2015, with producers in Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rh\u00f4ne and Champagne talking up the harvest as \u201cexceptional\u201d. This is particularly encouraging for the wine trade in Bordeaux, which has been struggling following a series of lacklustre red vintages. We\u2019ll get to see just how good 2015 really is when Bordeaux producers show their unfinished wines to the press and trade in the spring. But it seems that, for the first time in five years, the quality may go some way towards justifying the hype (and inevitably crazy prices). DW 34: Noble Rot If you\u2019d told Dan Keeling and Mark Andrew back in 2013, when they launched wine magazine Noble Rot , that they\u2019d be the brains behind one of 2015\u2019s most feverishly received openings, they\u2019d have laughed in your face. But that\u2019s exactly what former music A&amp;R man Keeling and Andrew, ex-buyer at Roberson Wine, have pulled off with this wine bar/restaurant. It helps that they handed kitchen duties to Paul Weaver, once of Stephen Harris\u2019s Sportsman. It also helps that Harris co-developed the menu, a whip-smart mix of wine-bar staples (brilliant charcuterie, immaculate cheese), old Sportsman favourites and the odd slam-dunk of a showstopper (halibut braised in oxidised 1998 B\u00e2tard-Montrachet Grand Cru); and that the wine list makes aficionados go all gooey-eyed. Three months in, Noble Rot already looks lived in in just the right way, a 21st-century answer to Robin\u2019s Nest \u2013 and we mean that as a compliment. BG51 Lamb\u2019s Conduit Street, London WC1 35: Tiffany Jesse, fermentation queen     Tiffany Jesse, Food alchemist. Photograph: Mark Sanders    Tiffany Jesse was given some kefir grains about nine years ago and has been nurturing them ever since. The grains are a culture which can be made into a fermented \u201cmilk\u201d. \u201cThe end product ranges from mild to super sour,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can often be effervescent and is known as the \u2018champagne of milk\u2019.\u201d Kefir grains look a bit like cottage cheese and can last a lifetime if you look after them. After fermenting, the thickened milk is strained and the remaining grains go back into a clean glass jar, ready for the process to be repeated as often as you like. If you don\u2019t have a friend with spare grains, you can buy them online (from Ocado, Planet Organic, and Abel and Cole). Jesse drinks kefir every day, often for breakfast. She also makes a kefir quark by letting the whey strain through a muslin cloth. She has a farm in Dorset where she rents out a holiday home, grows vegetables, and keeps chickens and goats and brings up her 10-year-old son, Jesse. If her goats have kids in the summer she will use the raw milk to make her kefir. That, she says, is \u201cthe gold standard\u201d.

Jay Rayner wrote: \u201cI imagine that, in years to come, all the people involved here will go on to much bigger things.\u201d Now, one of those things has arrived in the form of Ellory, just the other side of London Fields, which has received similarly warm notices. Mayfields chef Matthew Young is at the helm, along with Jack Lewens, formerly sommelier at Spring. Young wants to offer a stylish, affordable update on French bistro cooking. \u201cWe want to serve food that we want to eat ourselves,\u201d says Young, a late starter as a chefwho studied painting at art college. As a chef, he\u2019s a minimalist, a specialist in the art of simplicity, of balancing a few ingredients with little fuss and maximum impact. Think Blackface lamb with anchovy and radicchio, or raw scallop with hazelnut and Jerusalem artichoke. Oh, and a five-course dinner is a relatively modest \u00a338. ECEllory, 1 Westgate Street, London E8 3RL 37: Istanbul With outposts of Cecconi\u2019s, Zuma and even Pizza East, plus the Ristorante Italia Di Massimo Bottura, Istanbul\u2019s food scene has become truly global. Thankfully, for those craving more traditional Turkish flavours, the city\u2019s homegrown restaurants aren\u2019t doing badly either. Anatolian stalwart \u00c7iya Sofras\u0131, in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y on the Asian side, continues to impress 29 years after opening, with its array of regional dishes, such as stuffed loquats, lamb with sour plums and roasted borage. Meanwhile, Alancha \u2013 which opened last year \u2013 brings foraging to Istanbul, with many ingredients on the 18-course tasting menu coming from champion-windsurfer-turned-chef Kemal Demirasal\u2019s own farm. Affordable but delicious food is plentiful. If you see a queue of workers outside a cafe serving whatever its lunchtime speciality is, you can be pretty sure it\u2019s worth joining. Places to seek out include Meshur Filibe K\u00f6ftecisi on Ankara Caddesi (a few minutes\u2019 walk up from the Sirkeci train station), which serves juicy lamb k\u00f6fte with green salad and crusty bread; Adem Baba fish restaurant in the pretty Arnavutk\u00f6y district; and Boris\u2019in Yeri in Kumpak\u0131, which, in its tiny shop, serves little more than plates of the incredibly addictive kaymak \u2013 a kind of clotted cream \u2013 with local honey drizzled over the top. LM 38: All the afternoon tea in China A mainstay on the Hong Kong culinary scene for decades, afternoon tea has caught on in cosmopolitan Shanghai and, more recently, in Beijing. Despite the capital\u2019s five-star hotels, such as the Peninsula, offering cucumber sandwiches, scones and clotted cream for a while, it\u2019s only become genuinely popular in the past couple of years, says Leon Wang, food and beverages manager of the Ritz-Carlton Beijing, as China\u2019s middle class begin to acquire luxury experiences to go with their luxury goods. So branded afternoon teas have become popular \u2013 Lanvin, Issey Miyaki and Godiva chocolates are all involved \u2013 with fashionable young women replacing the old clientele of businessmen and tourists. Even Pizza Hut and KFC have started adding afternoon tea to their menus, injecting a little class into deep-pans and chicken wings.

Photograph: Thomas Degner    Noma is relocating in 2017, but this year sees the launch of its long-awaited second restaurant. This spring, 108 will open in an old warehouse around the corner from its sibling and be more casual (there\u2019s room for walk-ins) and affordable (\u00e0 la carte dishes are between \u00a39-\u00a318) but no less ambitious. During a trial run in the Noma dining room, courses included caramelised milk skin stuffed with aged cheese and truffle, and romaine stems wilted in oyster marinade. \u201cWe want to create a place where you can drop by on your way home from work for a beer and a main course,\u201d said 108 head chef Kristian Baumann. LEStrandgade 93, DK-1401 Copenhagen 40: Chefs discovering the work/life balance The kitchen-as-war-zone mindset, with 100-plus-hour weeks and hard-nut head chefs, informs the legends of Marco, Gordon et al. But the dinosaur days might be over \u2013 or at least changing. Last year, Sat Bains announced that, to improve working conditions, his acclaimed Nottingham restaurant would open only four days a week. \u201cI\u2019m used to the unsocial hours,\u201d Bains explained, \u201cbut why should the next generation have to be?\u201d Several high-profile joints, including Le Gavroche and Hibiscus, followed suit, but it\u2019s not an entirely altruistic move: happy staff are less likely to jump ship, and the industry is having trouble finding, and retaining, staff; shorter hours also free up time for development work and lucrative private events. Corbin &amp; King (the Wolseley, the Colony, Bellanger, etc), meanwhile, introduced a flexi-time initiative to entice female talent back after taking time out to raise children. Many chefs have long insisted on a decent work/life balance for their employees (take a bow, Giorgio Locatelli) \u2013 but if restaurateurs are at last taking this issue seriously, who knows, maybe they\u2019ll next put their minds to service charges and wages? BG 41: Kombucha In Chinese, Korean and Russian the word for kombucha translates as \u201ctea fungus\u201d. To make it at home, you need a scoby (symbiotic compound of bacteria and yeast) which is mixed with tea and allowed to ferment. The scoby feeds off the tea: the result is a slightly fizzy drink that tastes sour like vinegar. It\u2019s thought to date back to 220BC but since the 1990s it has been made commercially and that\u2019s how you\u2019re most likely to come across it \u2013 in a bottle in a health food shop or a hipster grocer. And come across it you will. The global market for commercially made kombucha is estimated to be $1.8bn by 2020. TB 42: Trattoria Da Maria When I yearn for Italy \u2013 which is badly and often \u2013 I go to the Trattoria Da Maria, in Notting Hill Gate, London. I\u2019ve been coming here since the early 1980s before I worked in Naples and Rome. This is Notting Hill, subject to hyper-inflation of rents and change, and the Neapolitan Ruocco family that runs Da Maria shouldn\u2019t have stood a chance, not after two Starbucks, All Bar One and Pr\u00eat appeared. The arrival of Jamie Oliver over the road seemed a final nail in Da Maria\u2019s coffin. I lived in Naples with a season ticket at San Paolo stadium during the years Diego Maradona played there, and I swear: this is the best Neapolitan family cooking north of that Fuorigrotta neighbourhood. Each time a new rival appeared, I watched Da Maria take the blow. But the Ruoccos now thrive \u2013 what happened? Pasquale and his wife Maria Rosaria hit on an idea: Napoli Football Club, their passion. Up went the shirt Maradona wore in a match, framed. Up went a mural of the Vesuvian bay and Sophia Loren. Word got around: if you are an Italian in London, this is where you eat like Mamma cooked; if you support Napoli, you get to watch the game. Maradona\u2019s son, Diego Jnr, came for lunch; commentators on Italian TV send \u201csaluti ai tifosi\u2013 greetings, fans! \u2013 a Da Maria, Notting Hill\u201d, when Napoli kick off. The club\u2019s most-capped player, Giuseppe Bruscolotti, acclaimed the trattoria as \u201cpart of our history\u201d. So now, for every match, the place is packed, and they stand six-deep on the pavement outside. EV87 Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3JZ 43: The Kiwi connection New Zealanders have long been quietly influential on British food. Not just Peter Gordon, but also Margot Henderson, who opened the French House Dining Room with Fergus Henderson in 1992 and now runs Shoreditch\u2019s Rochelle Canteen. Then there\u2019s Monica Galetti, of MasterChef: the Professionals, soon to open her first restaurant, and Juliet Harbutt, founder of the British Cheese Awards. More recently, fellow Kiwis such as Michael Allpress have been crucial to Britain\u2019s growing UK coffee culture, and the link between the two countries has come full circle in the form of Caravan co-founder and chef director Miles Kirby, who was once head chef at \u2026 Peter Gordon\u2019s Providores. MT-H 44: The Sportsman\u2019s aged beef project Stephen Harris has always had a keen interest in dairy produce. At the Sportsman, his pub-restaurant near Whitstable in Kent, the Michelin-starred chef churns his own butter and goes out of his way to source raw cream. Lately, he\u2019s been seeing old dairy cows in a new light. \u201cIt started when I went to F\u00e4viken in 2011 and Magnus Nilsson was serving retired dairy cow at the restaurant. I tasted the meat and thought, wow, this is extraordinary. Then London started going nuts for old milkers from Galicia.\u201d Why, he wondered, aren\u2019t we making better use of our own old milk cows? As well as producing great meat, wouldn\u2019t it give a boost to the British dairy industry? He brought this up with his supplier Jerry Wilson, at Ottinge Court Farm near Folkestone, and they decided to test it out. Wilson had been selling his old cows to an abattoir for \u00a3800-\u00a31,000 and the meat was ending up between burger buns. Harris paid Wilson the going rate for an eight-year-old Friesian crossbreed and, after fattening it for six months, they had it slaughtered in November. The early signs were good. \u201cAfter hanging it for just three weeks I tasted the fillet, which is usually all texture no flavour, and the taste was incredible. I knew we were on to something.\u201d Retired Kentish dairy cow with tarragon sauce and Camembert potato pur\u00e9e went on the Sportsman\u2019s menu before Christmas and the response was encouraging. By the time I make it to Whitstable in early January, most of the 500kg cow has been used up \u2013 the lesser cuts went to a burger chain in Deal, bringing total earnings up to \u00a32,000 \u2013 but Harris still has topside left for me to try. He gives it a sear and plates it. I\u2019ve never been wowed by topside before but this is sensational: complex, with a blue cheese funkiness that lingers on the palate. Thankfully, Harris will be taking more of Wilson\u2019s old dairy cows off his hands in the year ahead. KF 45: Leon Aarts &amp; Calais camp kitchens     Leon Aart at his Calais \u2018Jungle\u2019 camp kitchen. Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen for Observer Food Monthly    Feeding people has always been Leon Aarts\u2019s priority. Not so long ago, he was a chef, restaurateur and entrepreneur in the Netherlands, with a wholesale business supplying high-end ingredients such as Wagyu beef and truffles. Now, he heads a team of 60, split between one warehouse and three gas-powered kitchens, serving up to 2,000 meals a day at the migrant camp in Calais. He\u2019s been working there since last October, though his change of career began in 2007 after a business event in Bali, when he felt his attitude shift. \u201cI realised that the successes I had were only on the outside, not the inside,\u201d he says. He initially gave up his food career to start a foundation called Fill the Cup, feeding children in developing countries. His current role distributing food and running kitchens in Calais came after a friend asked him to help out, \u201cand I just said yes\u201d. Most food is donated or bought from fundraising in the UK and the meals are meat-free: rice with a vegetable stew or curry or dal. Before the recent demolition of part of the camp, Aarts supplied emergency packs to those forced to leave. He has also started supplying the small camps of 100-500 people which pop up in the area and is involved in building six small community kitchens in Dunkirk. Now a co-founder of fundraising initiative Nourish, raising money in the UK to feed refugees in Calais, Aarts feels thankful for his big move away from fine dining, concluding: \u201cThe most beautiful thing is the connection between human beings, from all nationalities, how we come together and make things happen with limited funds and resources. Everyone supports each other, even in these very difficult circumstances.\u201d BP 46: Sustainable eels Eels have something of an arduous life cycle, and their dwindling stocks are causing alarm. Adult eels migrate from estuarine waters in Europe to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, which surrounds Bermuda. Baby eels \u2013 elvers \u2013 head back to their roots, a journey that takes two years or more. They cannot feed until they reach fresh water, where they\u2019ll take at least 15 years to reach maturity. Although elvers were once commonplace and considered a delicacy, 80% of those caught in the UK are now used to restock rivers, but there is growing concern about the sustainability of processing eels fished in the wild. Aquaculture seems to be the answer. The Severn and Wye Smokery in Gloucestershire is tackling the issue and is now working with eel farms in Sweden, Denmark and Holland by sending them elvers caught on the River Severn and buying their farmed adult eels in return. KH 47: Tom Kerridge\u2019s chocolate grenades Tom Kerridge was scrolling through Instagram when he noticed a photograph of a giant grenade apparently made of chocolate. \u201cIs it real?\u201d he asked Katie Lodge, the artist responsible. She told him no, the chocolate was fake, to which he replied: \u201cWant to do something cool?\u201d Lodge, a prop designer in the film industry, had been making oversized grenades out of resin and decorating them to look like Ming vases and chocolate eggs. The idea of making an edible version hadn\u2019t occurred to her. With the help of Kerridge and pastry chef Claire Clark, she prepared 200 real-chocolate grenades for her first solo show Bitter Sweet, which opens at east London\u2019s CNB gallery on 22 March. \u201cWe want them to be indulgent,\u201d Kerridge tells me. \u201cThese will be solid and filled to the rafters with good stuff.\u201d That means fondant, caramel and possibly Turkish delight. Lodge insists she\u2019s not making any political statements by turning instruments of war into chocolate bombs \u2013 she\u2019s more interested in how they look \u2013 but she does say this: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to throw a grenade, throw a chocolate one.\u201d KF 48: Barbara Ketcham Wheaton Barbara Ketcham Wheaton, an American food historian, is 84 years old. She lives a quiet life, in a continuing-care community near Boston. But, for the past 50 years, Wheaton has been engaged in a project of astonishing ambition. More or less single-handedly, she has created a database called The Cook\u2019s Oracle, designed to record the contents of every cookbook published up to 1900 in all the major European languages. It\u2019s now computerised, but when Wheaton started, she wrote down the entries on \u2018McBee\u2019 cards, sticking knitting needles through holes to search. The idea is that cooks and historians alike will be able to compare every historic souffl\u00e9 recipe ever published; every tip for flakier pastry or better digestion. Wheaton has 130,000 individual entries from books by more than 6,000 authors, but the categories keep expanding. Her list of search terms ranges from hospitality to heat; from porcini to porpoise. The database reveals the extent to which cookbooks in the past contained not just delicious morsels but strange medical advice, such as remedies for an easy childbirth or handy cures for baldness: \u201call this crank stuff,\u201d as Wheaton puts it. Then again, as she wryly observes, modern cookbooks still mirror our health worries and \u201canxieties about what should I feed my children?\u201d The database is not online yet, although a version should be live this year. Not that it can ever really be finished: there is always another way to search. Wheaton \u2013 a delightfully humorous person \u2013 knows she has set herself a vast task, so, \u201cIt\u2019s just as well I\u2019m only 84.\u201d BW 49: Alan Micks It\u2019s taken 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall for organic farmers to recolonise Berlin\u2019s lush river-laced Brandenburg farmland. This raging farm-to-table moment has triggered a wave of restaurants staffed by chefs from around the world, such as 34-year-old Alan Micks, from Limerick, who has his stove at the Hotel Michelberger\u2019s eponymous restaurant, the go-to watering hole/lunchroom for Berlin\u2019s film and music industry elite, by the River Spree in the Freidrichshain district. After starting out at Dublin\u2019s stately Hotel Merrion, Micks paid his dues at London\u2019s Lanesborough, Auckland\u2019s Hotel DeBrett and New York\u2019s WD-50. The globetrotting wisdom shows in his fine, firm hand on the venison, boar, beef, pork and fish delivered by his coterie of Brandenburg hunters, farmers and fishermen. Micks\u2019s resolutely local, wholly organic menu is a first among Berlin hotels, and on the card last month was a roast duck breast with liquorice, quince and salt-baked parsips, as well as wild venison with beetroot, homemade sausage, and pickled walnuts. His potato mash is famed for the subtle dark, sweet notes delivered by smoked butter. The historical ironies of the dish are not lost on Micks. \u201cBit sad, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he says. \u201cAn Irishman comes to Berlin and gets known for potatoes. Now we can\u2019t take it off the menu.\u201d GM40, Warschauer Strasse 39, 10243 Berlin 50: The Bramble The Bramble began life at Fred\u2019s Bar \u2013 a notorious London member\u2019s bar in the 80s with a reputation for shenanigans and the late great Dick Bradsell, who died last month, at the helm. Having the pleasure of working with Bradsell at the beginning of my career, the Bramble remains one of my favourite of his creations. Faithful to a classic format \u2013 a sour base sweetened with a little liqueur \u2013 Dick\u2019s mastery of carefully balancing ingredients has turned it into a true modern classic. What made him so pioneering is that he created really drinkable drinks with ingredients that everyone could get hold of, and in this way they became universal. I love the egalitarian approach, which brought about a cocktail revival in the UK. This outlook, coupled with a dedication to a high-end level of service and wicked sense of humour, made Dick a virtuoso in navigating social situations. He knew what his customer wanted to drink before they knew themselves and where to position them in the room. I remember being at his house creating the menu for Party Bar and he\u2019d gone out the night before and bought a ton of kids\u2019 crayons and swaths of paper. We drew the menu across the sheets and fixed them to the wall of the bar that night. All customers had to do was point at these giant drawings and we\u2019d get to work. He was a purveyor of fun, and you can taste a little of this in the Bramble.

Its black front page, a photograph of Shanghai in darkness as part of the Earth Hour event, marked the death of a newspaper dream. Call it the Independent on Sunday: The Journalists\u2019 Edition, because it overflowed with reminiscences by staff past and present, hymning the contribution their beloved newspaper has made to Britain and to journalism. Amid the paper\u2019s routine news and features, which included an interview with David Cameron and a voter\u2019s guide to the EU referendum, several columnists bade their sad newsprint farewells. Steve Connor, science editor throughout the Sindy\u2019s life, reminded readers of his topic\u2019s central place in the paper\u2019s agenda. Cole Moreton raged against the political iniquities he has witnessed, registering his pride in the paper\u2019s opposition to the \u201cmisguided war\u201d on Iraq. Dom Joly said it had been a privilege to write his column for 15 years. Other regulars, aware of their possible appearance in the online Independent, perhaps, or because they saw no point to it, wrote without mentioning the Sindy\u2019s demise. Robert Fisk, in a clever nod to journalism\u2019s longevity as distinct from that of its \u201cplatform\u201d, chose to interview the oldest living war correspondent, Clare Hollingworth, now aged 104. Famous for witnessing Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland in 1939, she claimed a genuine world exclusive: the outbreak of the second world war.  The New Review - which a former Independent owner, Tony O\u2019Reilly believed to be the ne plus ultra of Sunday newspaper magazines - was devoted entirely to the Independent on Sunday\u2019s story, republishing articles that were a testament to its journalistic verities. Some of the staff who were there at the beginning, on 28 January 1990, recounted their experiences. On Saturdays, recalled subeditor Barbara Gunnell, \u201ca trolley of champagne and sandwiches would be wheeled into the editor\u2019s office.\u201d  The editor, Lisa Markwell, recalled the eight who sat in their chair before her, from launch editor Stephen Glover, on through Ian Jack, Peter Wilby, Rosie Boycott, Kim Fletcher, Janet Street-Porter, Tristan Davies and John Mullin. All exerted their very different personalities on to a paper that tried so very hard to forge a niche somewhere between the Sunday Times and The Observer.  It did well, very well indeed for quite a while, and can point to a having acted as the springboard for writers who went on to become famous, such as Sebastian Faulks, Zoe Heller and Blake Morrison. It played host to fine journalists: interviewers, columnists, cartoonists page designers and photographers. It was inventive, distinctive and sometimes unconventional. It was brave at times and also honest. In 1997, it launched a campaign to decriminalise cannabis; in 2007, it apologised for having done so. The Sindy campaigned relentlessly for climate change to be taken seriously by politicians, winning many deserved awards for such work down the years. It is fair to say that the paper was a journalistic ornament. But the fragility of that ornament was evident from its first appearance on the newsstands amid an economic recession. It then developed cracks during Fleet Street\u2019s unsentimental war for readers - and, most importantly, advertisers - as rival publishers sought to regain the initiative in the mid-1990s. Early in this century, despite a generous and loving owner in O\u2019Reilly and, later, an optimistic Evgeny Lebedev, those cracks widened and deepened. The Independent on Sunday, in company with its flagship, The Independent, were the weakest national papers in terms of sales and could not resist the inexorable advance of the digital revolution. So the ornament has finally shattered. Many of the journalists who have graced its pages, such as Fisk, Patrick Cockburn, Rupert Cornwell and Hamish McRae, will continue writing online. They have recorded profound political and economic changes across the globe for a quarter of a century, and surely accept that they must accommodate technological change themselves. But, like all veterans of newsprint, they regret the passing of a newspaper in the inky format that sustained for centuries. The Independent on Sunday, the title known affectionately as the Sindy, is no more.

The research, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, references past climatic conditions, recent observations and future models to warn the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets will contribute to a far worse sea level increase than previously thought.   Related: Sea level rise is accelerating; how much it costs is up to us | John Abraham    Without a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the global sea level is likely to increase \u201cseveral meters over a timescale of 50 to 150 years\u201d, the paper states, warning that the Earth\u2019s oceans were six to nine meters higher during the Eemian period \u2013 an interglacial phase about 120,000 years ago that was less than 1C warmer than it is today.  Global warming of 2C above pre-industrial times \u2013 the world is already halfway to this mark \u2013 would be \u201cdangerous\u201d and risk submerging cities, the paper said. A separate study, released in February, warned that New York, London, Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai will be among the cities at risk from flooding by 2100. Hansen\u2019s research, written with 18 international colleagues, warns that humanity would not be able to properly adapt to such changes, although the paper concedes its conclusions \u201cdiffer fundamentally from existing climate change assessments\u201d. The IPCC has predicted a sea level rise of up to one meter by 2100, if emissions are not constrained. Hansen, and other scientists, have argued the UN body\u2019s assessment is too conservative as it doesn\u2019t factor in the potential disintegration of the polar ice sheets. Hansen\u2019s latest work has proved controversial because it was initially published in draft form last July without undergoing a peer review process. Some scientists have questioned the assumptions made by Hansen and the soaring rate of sea level rise envisioned by his research, which has now been peer-reviewed and published. Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, said the revised paper still has the same issues that initially \u201ccaused me concern\u201d. \u201cNamely, the projected amounts of meltwater seem \u2026 large, and the ocean component of their model doesn\u2019t resolve key wind-driven current systems (e.g. the Gulf Stream) which help transport heat poleward,\u201d Mann said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m always hesitant to ignore the findings and warnings of James Hansen; he has proven to be so very prescient when it comes to his early prediction about global warming. That having been said, I\u2019m unconvinced that we could see melting rates over the next few decades anywhere near his exponential predictions, and everything else is contingent upon those melting rates being reasonable.\u201d Hansen was one of the first scientists to push climate change into the public\u2019s consciousness, following a series of appearances before Congress in the 1980s. He retired from his role at Nasa in 2013 and has become increasingly outspoken about the need to slash emissions, criticizing last year\u2019s Paris climate deal as a \u201cfraud\u201d because it didn\u2019t go far enough.     James Hansen argues that the effects of melting glaciers, such as this one near Ilulissat, Greenland, could be devastating. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty    His new research warns that water gushing from melted glaciers is already influencing important ocean circulations near both poles. The added cold water risks \u201cshutting down\u201d the North Atlantic heat circulation, triggering a series of storms similar to Hurricane Sandy, which hobbled New York City in 2012. \u201cIf the ocean continues to accumulate heat and increase melting of marine-terminating ice shelves of Antarctica and Greenland, a point will be reached at which it is impossible to avoid large-scale ice sheet disintegration with sea level rise of at least several meters,\u201d the paper states. \u201cThe economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable.\u201d Hansen said the world was \u201cpretty darned close\u201d to the point of no return, warning that emissions need to be cut by about 6% a year in order to stabilize the climate. \u201cWhat we are threatening to do to young people is irreversible, it\u2019s irreparable harm,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something they didn\u2019t cause but will be out of their control. Among the top experts, there\u2019s agreement that this is very urgent, we can\u2019t continue on this path hoping that emissions will go down, we have to take actions.\u201d Hansen reiterated his call for a global tax on carbon, denying that the roles of scientist and advocate for change are conflicted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t advocacy, this is what is needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are allowing fossil fuel companies to use the atmosphere as a free waste dump. If scientists don\u2019t say it then politicians will tell you what\u2019s needed and that will be based upon politics rather than science. I don\u2019t see any reason to not make the whole story clear, or to draw a line and say \u2018I\u2019m not going to step beyond this.\u2019\u201d Tom Wagner, Nasa\u2019s program scientist for the cryosphere, said Hansen has done an \u201camazing job\u201d in providing a \u201cprovocative\u201d piece of research on sea level rise. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting paper as it\u2019s one of the few times when all of these different fields have been combined,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is at odds with some research from other places. He\u2019s made a great effort to combine the Eemian period to what is happening today, which is hard to do. It\u2019s a tough one. \u201cWe know that our knowledge of ice sheet behavior is imperfect, and this is a paper that really gets into that question. We are narrowing down the error bars all the time.\u201d Scientists recently expressed alarm at the record heat that has baked the planet in the first few months of 2016, which follows a year that was the warmest on record.  These record temperatures, aided by a strong El Ni\u00f1o event, come as nations appear to be slowing the growth of the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the excess heat. Recent figures show the world emitted 32.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from energy in 2015, on a par with 2014, while accelerating the shift to renewable energy. Nevertheless, humanity is still pumping out CO2 into the atmosphere at a rate 10 times faster than at any point in the past 66m years, with the resulting sea level rises, extreme weather events, coral bleaching and drought already evidenced around the globe.

There were also significant drops in some Italian cities, including Rome, Trieste and Genoa. Nicosia and Larnaca in Cyprus were also among the worst performers.     Graphic depicting global rises in urban property markets. Photograph: Knight Frank    The Global Residential Cities Index showed that house prices in cities worldwide went up 4.4%. Behind Shenzhen, Auckland was the second fastest growing market with rises of 25.4%, followed by Istanbul (25%) and Sydney (19.9%).

In 1979, it was declared China\u2019s first special economic zone and surrounded by an 85-mile long, barbed wire fence. Investment and migrant workers flooded the area and factories and housing were built from scratch. By the mid-90s, the population had climbed to 3 million.

Two Turkish cities featured in the top 10 \u2013 Istanbul and Izmir \u2013 while Budapest recorded the biggest rise among European Union cities, with prices up 16.3%. Budapest is also the strongest performing capital city in the index, with demand fuelled by an investment immigration bond for Chinese nationals. Cities traditionally associated with high prices failed to feature prominently. London was ranked at 16 (11.4% growth) with New York at 89th (3.3%). The fast rising prices of Sydney, the fourth fastest rising market, has resulted in high rents and the same sort of concerns about the effects on the young population in the city as in London.  In the US, Portland in Oregon and San Francisco were the highest risers, both with increases over the year of 10%. The fastest growing North American city was Vancouver, with prices up nearly 12% on an annual basis.

At the bottom of the league table, with the fastest falling prices, was the Indian city of Chandigarh, the capital of the north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, which has a population of 1 million and has been rated as India\u2019s wealthiest city. However, house prices in the city declined by 7.7% last year. The Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates four times last year, but the base rate still stands at 6.75% and the economy has faltered.

And by the middle of February it seemed well-founded, as markets slumped to levels not seen since July 2012 amid panic selling and warnings of a new financial crisis. The FTSE 100 officially entered bear-market territory \u2013 a 20% decline from the peak it reached in April last year \u2013 as did France\u2019s CAC, the German Dax, the Shanghai Composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei. US markets avoided this fate only because the American economy seemed to be the best placed to weather any financial squalls.   Stock market graphs   But as spring approached, investors began seeing green shoots, and markets rallied as the first quarter drew to a close, even though the volatility refused to die down. By this weekend the FTSE 100 had rebounded more than 10% from its February low, and was around 120 points shy of recovering all its losses for the year. That is not to say investors are out of the woods. January\u2019s slump, which saw the FTSE 100 suffer its worst opening week since 2000, was due to a number of factors, some of which still apply. Not for nothing did George Osborne repeat at this month\u2019s budget his earlier warning that the UK economy faced \u201ca dangerous cocktail of risks\u201d. Investors had dumped shares mainly on concerns about the outlook for the global economy, particularly China. Fears of falling demand led to a sharp drop in commodity prices \u2013 especially oil, where producers were reluctant to cut supplies. Even now, with producers scheduled to meet next month in an attempt to agree an output freeze, there are doubts about how effective such a move will be. Indeed Iran, which has just begun exporting oil again following the lifting of sanctions, is notably unwilling to sign up. Added to that is the prospect of new US shale production adding to the oversupply. So oil and mining companies \u2013 which dominate London\u2019s FTSE 100 in particular \u2013 saw hefty falls. Currencies were also a factor, with China devaluing the yuan last year to boost exports, and investors concerned that further such moves were likely. Meanwhile the US Federal Reserve had raised interest rates in December for the first time in almost a decade, and said four more rises were on the cards in 2016. This pushed the dollar up sharply, and added to the commodities crunch and worries about a currency war. The subsequent market turmoil and a host of poor economic data from around the globe seem to have changed the Fed\u2019s mind. This month it forecast just two rises in 2016. At a Senate hearing in February, Fed chair Janet Yellen even admitted the central bank was examining the idea of negative interest rates. This was quite a turnaround from December, and did mark the end of the market slump. Not that the Fed is really likely to move into negative territory. However, others \u2013 notably Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013 have already ventured there, and that has created its own problems. Bank shares came under pressure as investors fretted that negative rates were putting undue stress on the sector\u2019s balance sheets. Since the February low, some brighter economic news from China and the US, along with the Fed\u2019s new dovishness pushing the dollar lower and prompting a recovery in commodity prices, have combined to restore some calm, with New York\u2019s Dow Jones index hovering around levels seen at the start of the year. On top of that, the prospect of a freeze in output, however difficult that might be to achieve, has seen the price of Brent crude rebound more than 50% from its low of $27.88 a barrel to around $40. ECB president Mario Draghi did his part, expanding the bank\u2019s QE programme earlier this month, and helping out banks by giving them cheaper loans, while cutting interest rates again. Fears of another Chinese devaluation have also faded. The subsequent recovery in mining and banking shares, along with a weakening pound \u2013 which helps UK exporters \u2013 has pushed the FTSE 100 higher, and even the bomb attacks in Brussels failed to do much damage to sentiment. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets said: \u201cThe FTSE 100 has managed to recover back close to the levels that we saw at the end of last year, helped by a weaker pound and a stabilisation in commodity prices, which \u2013 when you consider where we were in mid-February \u2013 is a remarkable turn of events. Looking ahead to the second quarter, it seems unlikely that the volatility we\u2019ve seen this quarter will subside to any great degree, given that the concerns markets were obsessing about haven\u2019t gone away.\u201d It remains clear that the global economy is seeing at best a patchy recovery. And the realisation has dawned that central banks, whose easy money policies have been responsible for supporting stock markets since the 2008 financial crisis, may not have much firepower left. Even if the Fed does not raise rates as frequently as it suggested in June, it is unlikely to hold back for too long. Indeed, there is talk from Fed members about the next increase coming as soon as April, which has recently sent the dollar higher again and commodities lower, and took some of the shine off shares. New concerns have also emerged since January, notably the uncertainty for Britain if it votes to leave the EU, and the prospect of Donald Trump becoming US president.

Three years after being arrested on suspicion of sex crimes committed against a 13-year-old pupil at Chetham\u2019s School of Music, Wen Zhou Li was found not guilty after the prosecution formally offered no evidence against him. In a hearing on 18 March, the judge, Mr Justice Henshall, said Li could walk free \u201cwithout a stain on his character\u201d, according to his lawyers. The move marks an end to a three-year investigation into sex abuse at Chetham\u2019s and the Royal Northern College of Music, triggered by the conviction of Michael Brewer, former head of music at Chetham\u2019s, in February 2013. His victim, Frances Andrade, killed herself after giving evidence against him and did not see him found guilty of indecently assaulting her. After her suicide, dozens of former pupils contacted the Guardian to make allegations of sex abuse against other teachers at both schools, some still alive and others long dead. Greater Manchester police (GMP) then began Operation Kiso, which eventually led to three further teachers being charged with sex crimes against students at the two music schools. In September 2014 conductor Nicholas Smith was sentenced to eight months in prison after admitting sexually assaulting a 15-year-old pupil in the 1970s. Two months later, world-renowned double bassist Duncan McTier pleaded guilty to sexual assaults two counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted indecent assault against young women from the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) and Purcell school in Hertfordshire in the 1980s and 90s. Last June Malcolm Layfield, former head of strings at the RNCM, was found not guilty of raping one of his charges, when she was 18. In September the key suspect in Operation Kiso, violin teacher Chris Ling, killed himself when American law enforcement officials went to issue him with an extradition warrant at his home in Los Angeles. Ling had been due to face 77 charges of sex offences against 10 former pupils at Chetham\u2019s when they were as young as nine, as well as a woman who cleaned his house as a teenager. Speaking after the case against him was dropped, Li said he had never behaved inappropriately with any of his students during his decades-long career as a violin teacher, including the woman who went on to accuse him of rape. But the 61-year-old said that when he joined Chetham\u2019s and the RNCM in the early 1990s that pupil-teacher relationships were common. The most notorious of all was Ling, he said, describing him as \u201cevil\u201d.  Shanghai-born Li said he took over Ling\u2019s class at the RNCM shortly after Ling fled to the US with a group of sixth form students at Chetham\u2019s known as \u201cLing\u2019s Strings\u201d, following an aborted investigation by GMP into Ling\u2019s behaviour. \u201cHe just overpowered them emotionally, like nobody\u2019s business. He must have a gift for this, just like Hitler managed to overpower the whole of goddamn Germany,\u201d Li said, adding that the pupils told him that Ling had made them take their clothes off if they played a wrong note. Li claimed he would have been prepared to testify against Ling had he lived to face trial in the UK. \u201cI believed his complainants 100%,\u201d he said. But Li said he was not guilty of any abuse himself. He said the case against him was dropped when it emerged the complainant had made allegations against another music teacher in another country, but that no charges were ever brought. He also claimed that she came back to learn with him at the RNCM several years after the alleged abuse took place. \u201cWhy would she ask me to be her teacher again if I had raped her?\u201d he said. He was suspended by Chetham\u2019s and the RNCM after his arrest, which he accepted was correct given the seriousness of the allegations. But he objected to his bail conditions, which prevented him from having unsupervised access to his sons, now aged eight and 12. Cheshire social services attempted to take the boys into care, he claimed. Li now runs a supply chain management business between the UK and China and says he has no plans to return to teaching. \u201cFor two years after my arrest I couldn\u2019t even listen to music. It was too painful,\u201d he said. Greater Manchester police said: \u201cIn September 2014, Wen Zhou Li was charged with rape and two offences of indecent assault.

But there is a whole other potential person to consider, too \u2013 the new life that you are bringing into the world without asking first. It\u2019s not really fair. For while the world is a wonderful place, one we humans have made nicer for ourselves with wonderful inventions like books and record players, penicillin and pizza, it\u2019s also a really awful place, one we\u2019ve ravaged with deforestation and smog, nuclear weapons and mountains of pizza delivery boxes and other garbage.

We\u2019re living through what scientists call the \u201cSixth Extinction\u201d, an era of precipitous decline in the number of species able to live on the planet. The last mass extinction, the fifth, happened 66 million years ago, when a giant asteroid crashed into Earth and 76% of all the species on the planet perished. This time, we\u2019re doing it to ourselves.  \u201cClimate scientists agree that humanity is about to cause a sea level rise of 20 or 30ft, but they have tended to assume that such a large increase would take centuries, at least,\u201d the New York Times\u2019s Justin Gillis reported.

Thinking about the horrific future scientists predict hurts a very specific part of me, a part of me that I only first learned was there when I met my newborn son, 11 years ago, as he lay on the tray of the scale where the doctors had just weighed him and counted his fingers and toes. The moment is wordless, and as mind-blowing as any drug trip I ever took. But my friend Dave, who had kids before me, came closest to capturing its essence while we were talking later that day: it was like having a door open in your brain and stepping through it and realizing that there\u2019s this whole other part of your brain that you never knew was there before. A room, roughly the same size as the part of your brain that you\u2019ve been using all your life, it was vast and mostly empty (like your old brain) but in it I found stuff, inside myself, that I had never known was in there before.

And I realized a deep, heavy responsibility: protecting him was instantly the most important job of all my jobs \u2013 to keep this thing alive, healthy, happy, thriving.  Future climate meltdown was already a theoretical concern for future generations: what kind of world would my great-great-grandchildren inhabit? Now it all feels more pressing. How am I going to protect my kid? Was it fair for me to bring him into this world at all? Was it immoral?  Was I complicit in the damage? I remember every extra paper towel I\u2019ve ever unspooled from the roll, and think about a tree falling in the Amazon, and then think about my son growing up in a gray, dying world \u2013 walking towards Kansas on potholed highways. Maybe while trying to protect his own son, like the father in The Road. Will he decide to have a kid? I have foisted upon him a decision even more difficult than my own. It\u2019s all very depressing. Still, I come down on the side of advocating reproduction. It gets back to the power we have, we humans. Such devastating power, with which we\u2019ve already changed our world so dramatically. Maybe we can change it back, or at least innovate to survive. What if, and this is obviously a huge \u201cif\u201d, some young person, perhaps a certain 11-year-old in a Black Sabbath T-shirt (I highly doubt it, he can rarely remember to take his lunchbox out of his knapsack at the end of the day), perhaps someone who is not yet born, perhaps not yet conceived, is the one super-genius to figure out the invention that could save the planet?  The ultimate windmill system that can meet all our energy needs and somehow also cool the atmosphere while it works and also spread seeds to grow more trees as it does. And also make pizza. I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s kind of the point: we don\u2019t know. Maybe it could be something even better than that.  There\u2019s always maybe. And that\u2019s enough to persevere for.

Wilmer gave his Holmes an arrogance that he found missing from his screen predecessors, and he felt that his steely antihero was closer to Conan Doyle\u2019s intentions for the character. He was frustrated by the process of making the series, frequently rewriting scripts, clashing with directors and ruing the short rehearsal time typical in television of that period.

Douglas returned to the UK for education at King\u2019s school, Canterbury, and won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After a year there, he was called up for second world war service in the army and served as a troop commander in Nigeria and the Gambia, before being invalided out with\u00a0tuberculosis. After the war he secured leading roles in weekly repertory theatre in Rugby thanks to a recommendation from a fellow student from his Rada days, Elizabeth Melville, who was to become his first wife. He made his West End debut in Antony and Cleopatra at the Piccadilly theatre (1946), spent a season at the Shakespeare Memorial theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (1948) and joined the Old Vic company in 1951. Among his roles for them was the French king, Charles VI, in Henry V, for which he was singled out for praise by Kenneth Tynan. Subsequent theatre roles for which he received strong notices included Warwick in St Joan opposite Siobh\u00e1n McKenna (1954, Arts theatre, then St Martin\u2019s theatre), Claudius to the Hamlet of Alan Bates (Nottingham Playhouse, then Cambridge theatre, 1970) and Patrick Delafield in David Hare\u2019s Knuckle (Comedy theatre, 1974).

After hanging up his deerstalker he largely took guest roles in popular series such as The Avengers (1966) and The Main Chance (1970), before adding an addendum to his connection with 221b Baker Street by playing Van Dusen in The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (1971).   Related: Sherlock Holmes actor Douglas Wilmer dies aged 96    His film debut came as Dorset in Olivier\u2019s Richard III (1955) and his other films included El Cid (1961), Cleopatra (1963, with Elizabeth Taylor), Jason and the Argonauts (1963), The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966) and The Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967), as Nayland Smith, the dogged nemesis of Christopher Lee\u2019s eponymous master villain, Patton (1970, with George C Scott), Antony and Cleopatra (1972, with his good friend Charlton Heston), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973), The Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978) and Octopussy (1983). Growing disillusioned with the profession, he withdrew from acting to open a wine bar \u2013 inevitably called Sherlock\u2019s \u2013 in Woodbridge, Suffolk. He was a self-taught painter, his work inspired by frequent visits to Malta, who exhibited his watercolours and was a member of the Ipswich Art Society. But there was no escaping his most famous role and he came to embrace the praise bestowed upon his performance by admirers such as the Sherlock Homes Society of London, which appointed him an honorary member.

Writing for the Stranger, Rich Smith suggested that the poem expressed \u201cnostalgia for a white planet\u201d:   \u201cThis longing for a time of chow mein \u2013 which is, as I\u2019m sure the food writer knows \u2013 a westernized dish \u2013 is a longing for the days of a white planet. Those days when we white people comfortably held power, when they made food for us, when the only fear was the fear of another cuisine to conquer, the days before we had to ask ourselves stuff like \u2013 does this poem rest on an unexamined racist sentiment?\u201d  In his email, Trillin defended his poem, saying: \u201cSome years ago, a similar poem could have been written about food snobs who looked down on red-sauce Italian cooking because they had discovered the cuisine of Tuscany.\u201d Trillin pointed out another poem he published in the New Yorker, entitled What Happened to Brie and Chablis?  That poem, published in 2003, also pokes fun at the foibles of foodies, although the satirical tone is clearer: What happened to Brie and Chablis?Both Brie and Chablis used to beThe sort of thing everyone ateWhen goat cheese and Napa MerlotWeren\u2019t purchased by those in the know,And monkfish was thought of as bait. \u201cIt was not a put-down of the French,\u201d Trillin wrote.  Trillin did not immediately respond to a subsequent inquiry.

Raabe did not respond to a request for comment from the New Yorker editor-in-chief, David Remnick. The magazine\u2019s poetry editor, Paul Muldoon, did not respond to a request for comment.

It could be expected that the Brooklyn-born novelist would have been happy to return, yet something didn\u2019t sit right:  \u201cIn New York I have always felt lonely, the loneliness of the caged animal, which brings on crime, sex, alcohol and other madnesses.\u201d Miller didn\u2019t hurt for friends or charm \u2013 he was married five times \u2013 but he saw himself as an outsider, \u201cforever and ever the ridiculous man, the lonely soul\u201d, and it was his hometown that brought on this fever of loneliness. Could Miller\u2019s words be evidence that New York \u2013 where countless people have gone to find fame, work, love and even themselves \u2013 is the loneliest city in the world? Or is it possible that the person, not the place, was the source of Miller\u2019s discontent? And if so, what is the loneliest city? Urban life is more stressful than rural life, but whether it\u2019s lonelier is a point of debate among social scientists. A 2016 report by Age UK noted there are higher incidences of loneliness in cities, but precisely what brings it on is surprising. The same report found that gender and education are largely irrelevant \u2013 except for those with the highest level of education, who are often lonelier \u2013 and that household income and caring for a pet also have little effect.     Isolation is one of the biggest problems faced by Vancouver residents. Photograph: Ben Nelms/Reuters      What matters is not whether we live alone, but whether we feel alone  Eric Klinenberg     So what impacts loneliness, and how does that play out in cities? The size of a household inversely affects how you feel: the smaller the household, the more lonely it tends to be. And people who rent or own a home are lonelier than those with a mortgage, perhaps because cities with lots of renters \u2013 such as London, which is expected to have 60% of residents renting by 2025 \u2013 have greater transience, and potentially lower community engagement. New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco have rental figures hovering in the mid-50s. Renters dominate in German cities, too \u2013 a long-term trend attributed to low rents and housing policies, but one that may end up influencing neighbourhood engagement. One thing is certain: the percentage of those who live alone has increased dramatically. In the US, 27% of people live alone, up from 5% in 1920, and in New York City it\u2019s roughly one third. The same trend is evident in Canada, and even more pronounced in Europe \u2013 58% of people in Stockholm live alone, a figure that is considered the highest in Europe. In many cities, the trend is here to stay. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that there will be 1.3m more single-occupancy households by 2025, a jump of roughly 60%, and one that could crowd major cities and affect access to affordable housing.   Related: \u2018My neighbour avoids me ... I was very unhappy\u2019: your tales of urban loneliness    Obscured by those figures, however, is the assumption that living alone leads to loneliness \u2013 two things the sociologist Eric Klinenberg, author of Going Solo, says are often conflated. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s little evidence that the rise of living alone is responsible for making us lonely,\u201d he wrote in 2012. \u201cResearch shows that it\u2019s the quality, not the quantity of social interactions that best predicts loneliness. What matters is not whether we live alone, but whether we feel alone.\u201d The demographic that most reports feeling lonely are older people, and they do often live alone. In Stockholm, 35% of people over the age of 75 experienced loneliness, while in Bristol 10-15% reported the same. (Hence the slogan \u201cBristol: a brilliant place to grow old.\u201d) Older people are likely to be more lonely in cities, especially if they are poorer, have physical or mental health issues or live in underprivileged areas.  Campaign to End Loneliness suggested that 7% of older people in the UK are lonely, while age researcher Thomas Scharf found that 16% of older people in deprived neighbourhoods in English cities were \u201cseverely lonely\u201d. Manchester fared worse than Liverpool or London, which may explain why it is treating loneliness as an urban health issue: it created the Valuing Older People programme in 2003 to address, among other issues, loneliness and isolation. Similar projects have sprung up in other cities which recognise that loneliness runs tandem to issues such as segregation, housing, healthcare, and isolation among seniors and others vulnerable citizens.     The networks of migrant workers in China might help to stifle isolation, but living and working conditions can be difficult. Photograph: Andy Wong/AP    But it\u2019s not only older people who suffer from isolation. In Australia, city dwellers have fewer friends than they did two decades ago. In the US, a troubling one in five people said they had only one close friend. Or consider idyllic-looking Vancouver, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, which struggles not only with affordability (it was recently crowned the most expensive city in North America), but also with friendliness.     We can see other people living richer, more populated lives than our own. At the same time, we can feel very exposed  Olivia Laing     The Vancouver Foundation thinktank asked community leaders and charities to identify the biggest issues facing Vancouverites and were told it wasn\u2019t homelessness or poverty; it was isolation. Of 4,000 people from 80-odd ethnic groups who were polled, one third of respondents found it hard to make friends \u2013 something I discovered firsthand when I spent a rainy, grey winter working in Vancouver, wandering Stanley Park alone with my dog at weekends and sitting in crowded cafes by myself. In this young, diverse city, the newly arrived struggle most: among people who had been in Canada for five years or less, almost half (42%) had just two close friends. A dearth of friendship doesn\u2019t afflict only recent immigrants. Many Tokyoites long for friends so dearly that they\u2019re willing to hire them. American writer Chris Colin, intrigued by Japanese \u201caffection for hire\u201d industries such as cuddle cafes and cat rentals, spent time with a service that provides temporary friends. The clientele was varied, he wrote: widowers, shy single types, \u201cthat one dude who just wanted a friend who\u2019d do him the solid of waiting seven hours outside Nike to snag these fresh sneakers for him when they went on sale\u201d. The largest of the rent-a-friend agencies, Client Partners, has eight branches in Tokyo alone.     Japanese cat cafes have become popular with people living in urban areas, as has the idea of \u2018affection for hire\u2019. Photograph: Junko Kimura/Getty Images    Across the Sea of Japan, there\u2019s a different problem: large-scale migration. As rural Chinese move to big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, they encounter isolation on an epic level. As of 2012, a staggering 230 million people had migrated from the countryside to cities. (More than half the country\u2019s population now live in cities, up from one third in 1990.) Known as the \u201cfloating population\u201d, they can find themselves in low-quality, high-density housing, subject to discrimination and at risk of low social participation, especially if they move frequently.  Researchers surveyed Chinese reports on community social networks, neighbourhood attachments and marginality and determined that migrants were more neighbourly \u2013 which may help them counteract isolation \u2013 but faced discrimination and, in some cases, grim living conditions: one corporation in the factory city Shenzhen houses more than 200,000 employees in dormitories, in which there\u2019s been an epidemic of suicides. The report noted: \u201cThe \u2018neighbourhood\u2019 for them is likely to be the factory.\u201d Yet in Beijing migrants had greater \u201cneighbouring intensity\u201d \u2013 in other words, they\u2019re better at connecting with their community \u2013 suggesting that migrants may bring much-needed village values to the lonely urban jungle.   Related: Where is the world\u2019s most remote city?    If life in China\u2019s megacities illustrates anything, it might be that loneliness is often due to circumstance. This wouldn\u2019t surprise Olivia Laing, whose new book, The Lonely City, chronicles a post-breakup stint in New York. \u201cThe thing with cities is we are absolutely surrounded by people,\u201d Laing recently told the Globe and Mail. \u201cWe can see other people living richer, more populated lives than our own. At the same time, we can feel very exposed \u2026 there are lots of eyes on everyone. That is why the loneliness of the city has a particularly distinct tang to it.\u201d Loneliness, however, is often like bad weather, \u201cit passes through our lives\u201d. So are people in Shanghai or Berlin more solitary than those in Stockholm or Vancouver? I put the question to one of the field\u2019s leading researchers, the University of Chicago\u2019s John Cacioppo, who wrote the book on the subject, Loneliness. His research disputes the idea that urban life is inherently lonelier than rural life, and he declined to play favourites and pick just one city. \u201cYou raise an interesting question,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, we have no data with which to address it.\u201d Maybe Laing is right that urban loneliness is ephemeral. Or perhaps we can learn from Henry Miller\u2019s struggle with New York: in 1944, he packed his bags and moved to sunny Big Sur, California.

Photograph: Yahoo/Yahoo Finance    The Bank of Japan surprised investors earlier this year when it announced a move towards negative interest rates in the hope of spurring investment and keeping the yen low. But the currency has instead surged, helped by a falling US dollar and the yen\u2019s traditional position as a safe haven in times of concern about the global economy.   \u201cA rapid move toward either yen rise or yen fall is not desirable.

The dollar last traded at around 108.90 yen, cooling exporter sentiment and weighing heavily on Japan\u2019s fight against deflation. With both external and domestic demand weakening, Japan is seen teetering on the edge of another recession. Economy minister Nobuteru Ishihara suggested that there may be speculative moves behind the recent yen gains, saying that he does not see any domestic economic factors that would cause the yen to rise.  The government is closely watching moves by speculative players in the foreign exchange market, he told a separate news conference.  A finance ministry official was quoted by Jiji newsagency as saying that the recent moves in the foreign exchange market was driven by speculators.

In photos you can see them in the garb of the times: grey Mao suits and fur hats, posing with Chinese farmers. For two months a nine member Aboriginal delegation was a guest of the Chinese Communist Party. It angered the Australian government and was a PR coup for the Chinese. At the time China remained in the cold \u2013 US President Nixon had only that year made his historic visit.   Related: 'It's the same story': How Australia and Canada are twinning on bad outcomes for Indigenous people    In the naivety and headiness of the times they were caught up in the revolutionary fervour of a country in the midst of a brutal purge that would end with more than a million people killed and millions more imprisoned, tortured and humiliated. Another member of the group, Lilla Watson, was on her first trip abroad and said it made her realise what a racist country Australia was. Delegation leader Chicka Dixon said in China \u201cwe were never called boongs or niggers\u201d. This was the height of the black power movement in Australia. Aboriginal people had pitched a tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House, some had formed a nascent chapter of America\u2019s Black Panther Party. With hindsight it was obviously misguided, but in those days some in the delegation saw Mao\u2019s China as pot of gold that could help finance social revolution back home.  Of course none of this went further than a headline. Fast forward to 2016 and Malcolm Turnbull is leading thousand captains of business and politics to Beijing. Like the Aboriginal delegation of 1972 \u2013 but for very different reasons \u2013 China is a beacon. The country once mired in violence and revolution, the sick man of Asia that could not feed itself is by some measures the world\u2019s biggest economy and an emerging superpower to rival the United States.  China\u2019s hunger for our natural resources helped drive Australia\u2019s mining boom and cushioned the impact of the global financial crisis. China is unavoidable and indispensable. It challenges \u2013 some suggest threatens \u2013 the regional order while underpinning economic growth.  There are storm clouds looming. China\u2019s economy is slowing as it transitions to what its leaders hope is a broader, more sustainable base. It wrestles with the environmental impact \u2013 choking skies and toxic rivers \u2013 of two decades of breakneck growth. There is growing protest and increasing demands from an emerging educated, tech-savvy and more worldly middle class. For the west there remains the challenge of incorporating China into a peaceful global order and avoiding what prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has identified as a Thucydides trap \u2013 when a rising power causes fear in an existing power and triggers inevitable conflict, as in Athens and Sparta in Ancient Greece or Germany and England a century ago. These concerns and opportunities are uppermost for Australia\u2019s delegation as it seeks to build on our free trade agreement. But amid the geopolitics and business deals does anyone consider there may be some lessons for Indigenous policy? Surely anyone seriously engaged in charting a successful secure future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people fully integrated into the Australian economy should look at China\u2019s extraordinary program of poverty reduction.  China has led the world in this area. The United Nations aimed to halve global poverty between 1990 and 2015. This was met five years early. China was responsible for three quarters of that achievement. How? Economic growth. Building infrastructure, creating jobs, educating an increasingly agile and mobile population. I hope I am not wrong in assuming this is on the agenda this week.  In the decades since the Aboriginal delegation visited in 1972, China has lifted more than half a billion people out of poverty. I reported this up close for years living in Hong Kong and Beijing. I saw how a country engineered a change from a rural-based society to an urban one. As people moved \u2013 albeit sometimes reluctantly \u2013 from small villages to towns and cities seeking employment their lifestyles were transformed, their health outcomes, quality of housing and educational attainment improved markedly.  In this China it is not inconceivable that the grandchild of a Chinese peasant farmer would go to university. It is far from perfect. There are strains on culture and society, the Confucian based model of hierarchy and subordination is having to adapt to a world of nuclear families and competitive crowded city streets. These are the consequences for peoples in transition. I wouldn\u2019t pretend that the situation of Indigenous people here and impoverished Chinese is perfectly analogous \u2013 a command economy, single party rule that can run roughshod over individual rights have helped underwrite China\u2019s transformation. But we can\u2019t ignore that fact that a country that could not feed itself has enriched its people while Indigenous Australians remain trapped in cycles of poverty in a country that is among the richest in the world still with a higher per capita income than China itself.   Related: I don't have all the answers, but we need to find a narrative that speaks to non-Indigenous Australia | Stan Grant    In China people moved. They seized new opportunities. I met a man who left his village to try his luck in Shanghai. At the height of the building boom he found a job on a construction site, he collected scraps and timber and metal off cuts and used tools. He sold them on street corners and eventually owned a string of hardware stores. These stories were not uncommon. I met rural farmers and people on remote mountain tops now doing business online, using mobile phones. People who had grown up in a country cut off from the world were now connected. Their children found new lives away from their traditional villages. Their remittances supported their parents back home. This isn\u2019t an argument for abandoning remote communities here, not everyone will find their future in cities, but we need serious people seeking smart solutions and part of that means confronting \u2013 as China and so many others have \u2013 a fundamental lesson of humanity, that isolation is ultimately untenable.  The Chinese speak of \u201castronauts\u201d, those who can orbit their communities and the world beyond their borders. They are equipped with the knowledge, capacity and confidence necessary for success. Aboriginal people are proving equally agile here and we need more of it.

Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    On Monday, residents of this normally sleepy community, which is a two-hour drive from Beijing through dramatic rocky outcrops and hilltops studded with crumbling sixth century watchtowers, were cautious about attributing blame. The most likely culprits, however, appear to be Chinese Buddhists. Villagers and local newspaper reports suggest the creatures were liberated on the nearby Liangnan mountain as part of \u201cfangsheng\u201d, a centuries-old Buddhist ritual by which devotees release captive animals into nature to boost their karma. The practice \u2013 which literally means \u201cto set life free\u201d \u2013 has boomed in recent years as more and more Chinese have sought spiritual succour at a time of dramatic social change. One Buddhist group, the Guangdong fangsheng association, boasts of releasing more than 100 million animals since 1989, according to a 2014 article in the China Economic Review. Each weekend, coaches carrying fangsheng fans and a veritable Noah\u2019s ark of animal life pour out of Chinese cities and into the countryside for karma-cultivating ceremonies that involve snakes, turtles, mice, hedgehogs, frogs, squirrels and fish, as well as foxes and raccoon dogs. Believers see freeing caged creatures as a good deed, but authorities and animal rights activists say there are dangers for rural communities, nature and the animals themselves, who are often bred in captivity and unable to fend for themselves in the wild.

By the following Monday, more than 20 of the woman\u2019s chickens had been killed during the nocturnal raids. Her four dogs, including one supposedly ferocious Alsatian, had done nothing to stop the carnage. \u201cI unleashed the dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they just went up to the foxes and sniffed them and then backed off.

Liu said he was unsure of their exact species, speculating that they might be a cross between a fox and a raccoon dog. \u201cThey are not your typical foxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are gentler.\u201d The farmer said he had been feeding his captives meat, rice and pieces of corn and planned to adopt them as pets \u201cfor fun\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s so unusual to find a wild animal around here,\u201d Liu explained, smiling. \u201cThey are friendly.

Instead, let's take ownership | Nathan Schneider", "article": "Throughout the 20th century, the chief legislative option in the United States for confronting monopolistic firms has been to break them up into pieces with antitrust law. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders now proposes this remedy for dealing with big banks, which appear no less \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d than they were when we bailed them out a few years ago.    What if, for instance, a bank seeking new borrowers had to bring them on as co-owners, with a vote in the boardroom?    This week, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp determined that five of the country\u2019s biggest financial institutions still have no plan, in the event of insolvency, other than turning to the public for more bailouts. But size is only one of the moral hazards at play. The real disaster of the 2008 crisis was not what happened to the banks \u2013 which shuffled their boardroom chairs a bit, paid back the government and kept on banking. The disaster was in what happened to millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color, who lost what little wealth they had to the banks\u2019 predatory lending and perverse incentives. This led to cascading fallout around the world. Perhaps we should consider a new approach to antitrust policy, one that puts the would-be victims in charge. It\u2019s not entirely clear that the bigness of banks, per se, is the main problem. We live in a much more globalized world than that of the late 19th century, when the present logic of antitrust law was concocted. If you want to use the same piece of plastic to pay for hotel rooms in Shanghai and in Durban, you need financial institutions capable of reaching that far.  I loved my old neighborhood credit union, but it wasn\u2019t much help when I moved out of the neighborhood; my new credit union is a bit bigger, and a lot more convenient. Even the call to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, and split deposits and lending from investing, could become harder to justify at a time when even individuals are making that distinction less and less. Perhaps the problem, then, is not bigness so much as badness. I suspect that, when many of us talk about banks being \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, what we really mean is \u201cnoxious institutions have come to dominate the economy so completely we can\u2019t get rid of them\u201d. As Jamie Merchant pointed out at In These Times recently, the idea of breaking up big companies assumes that what we need is more healthy, ruthless, capitalist competition. That might make particular banks less dominant, but it won\u2019t necessarily make them less noxious. The competition, in fact, could spur them toward greater recklessness. Some institutions need to be big, but they can at least be accountable. So, consider an alternative: rather than breaking up the big banks, what if a new generation of public policy created a pathway toward more democratic ownership? What if, for instance, a bank seeking new borrowers had to bring them on as co-owners, with a vote in the boardroom? They\u2019d be less likely to hoodwink those borrowers with a predatory loan; too many bad loans, and the new co-owners could rise up and get the CEO fired. What if those votes were counted according to the number of people, not by their wealth? Then institutions would have to be more accountable to the common good, not just to a few top shareholders. The ballooning financial industry might naturally shrink in the process, as institutions are forced to replace rampant speculation with responsible caution. Rather than buying up credit default swaps against its own customers, such banks might act more like my old credit union, which had a special office just for helping members avoid foreclosure and eviction. It\u2019s the difference between what Marjorie Kelly, in her lucid book Owning Our Future, refers to as \u201cextractive\u201d and \u201cgenerative\u201d ownership. One seeks only to maximize profits for shareholders who may or may not be directly affected by the enterprise; the other seeks to align the prosperity of an enterprise with the prosperity of those it serves.  In the last century, governments alternated between breaking up overgrown businesses into competitive pieces, or nationalizing them by handing them to state bureaucrats. This century, we should consider another approach: make them too good to fail. Make them accountable.", "tags": ["Banking reform", "Financial sector", "Occupy Wall Street", "Business"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-14T11:45:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/15/inside-50-does-collingwoods-nathan-buckley-really-deserve-so-much-grief", "sentences": ["And rounding out the week, Port Adelaide will play a 2017 Premiership season game in China, intriguing in many respects, not least the fact that the Power won\u2019t be forced to forfeit a home game in the process of extending a corporate relationship with Shanghai Cred Real Estate."], "title": "Inside 50: Does Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley really deserve this grief? | Russell Jackson", "article": "What point of an AFL season is too soon to suggest that a coach\u2019s job could be on the line? If you\u2019re Eddie McGuire and you happen to be said coach\u2019s boss, \u201cthe Tuesday following round three\u201d would appear to be the answer. In a strange appearance on Fox Footy\u2019s AFL360 this week \u2013 one McGuire intended primarily as a defence of the club and its embattled coach \u2013 the Collingwood president told host Gerard Whately he would have \u201cno problem at all\u201d sacking Nathan Buckley if the situation demanded it. A statement that followed soon after was every bit as interesting. McGuire said: \u201cIf there is one person on the face of God\u2019s earth who I don\u2019t have to worry about doing the right thing for Collingwood football club, it\u2019s Nathan Buckley.\u201d From this McGuire could be assumed to be saying that Buckley is currently offering his sincerest efforts, but perhaps also that should on-field fortunes slide further in 2016, \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d might have less favourable implications. \u201cMug clubs make rash decisions,\u201d McGuire reminded us. \u201cLet\u2019s just be cool and calm about it ... This [a sacking] is not even on the agenda ... we have full faith in Bucks.\u201d  They are statements it might pay to keep at hand as Collingwood face a tricky month: a hiding-to-nothing pair of games against Melbourne and Essendon, a daunting Perth trip to face West Coast and the big-game atmosphere of their oldest rival Carlton. If Pies fans adore McGuire they are within their rights, because what he\u2019s turned the club into through hard work and bloody-minded perseverance is undeniable. But where his and Buckley\u2019s jobs differ markedly is in the consequences of non-performance. Collingwood members are loyal beyond reason and a downturn on the balance sheet would barely be remarked upon by media and fans. But missing a third successive finals series \u2013 even for reasons not entirely controllable \u2013 carries far graver consequences. In last week\u2019s loss to St Kilda \u2013 where the Saints marched away with the game in the third term despite the fact that they were two men down \u2013 what really resonated was that no man is more reliant on his underlings than one in charge of young footballers. Former US college coach Clipper Smith hit on this when he was asked whether he missed the cut and thrust of the action once he was done as a coach.  \u201cI did at first,\u201d he said, \u201cbut after a while \u2013 well you can\u2019t imagine how it feels not to have to watch an 18-year-old kid run out on that field with your salary check fluttering between his fingers.\u201d  And we really should disabuse ourselves of the idea that coaches \u201close\u201d players, as has been suggested of Buckley at various stages in the last few years. What is a player who won\u2019t take instruction from a straight-shooting, Brownlow-medal-winning great of the game worth anyway? And is he also ignoring the assistants, line coaches and hordes of attach\u00e9s at the disposal of players at one of the best-resourced sporting clubs in Australia? An old cliche that would be better explored here is that of Premiership-hungry clubs looking to the prodigal son to light the path. Time and time again we\u2019ve been shown that it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand in the professional era. Favourite sons scattered among the wreckage of the last few decades include Michael Voss, Matthew Primus, Brett Ratten, Bernie Quinlan, Alex Jesaulenko, Wayne Schimmelbusch, Kevin Bartlett and, at the Pies again, Tony Shaw. In the past 25 years only three men have returned to coach a club they played for and steered it to a premiership \u2013 Dennis Pagan, Paul Roos and John Worsfold.  And even the imposing Worsfold was eventually worn down by pressures, including but not limited to simply being John Worsfold \u2013 avatar for everything fearsome and admired about the Eagles, and the guy who always kept his head as everyone else around him lost theirs. When he quit he was so worn down by the job that he hinted he never wanted to coach again. He looked gaunt, sickly and exhausted, like a man who\u2019d been strapped to a dentist\u2019s chair for a decade and forced to watch Karl Langdon\u2019s Vista Blinds TV adverts on an endless loop, Clockwork Orange style. That\u2019s what this job does to them. That\u2019s what we do to them. On Tuesday McGuire called the type of pressure Buckley is under \u201ca privilege\u201d, which in his unique form of Antipodean Gordon Gekko management-speak, probably counts as encouragement. But for Buckley, having so much of it piled on must also encroach on the mental space required to do his job. Collingwood\u2019s task against the Demons this week is not a straightforward one, as Roos\u2019s side showed well in their barnstorming comeback last week against North Melbourne. Gone are the days when Buckley could perhaps have adapted the famous Alex Ferguson line whenever Manchester United played Tottenham to read: \u201cLads, it\u2019s Melbourne.\u201d McGuire suggested that \u201canything could happen\u201d at the weekend and that such uncertainty was \u201cexciting\u201d.

Our interest was piqued by a range of No 9 guernseys worn by Hawthorn\u2019s Brownlow-winning premiership star and everybody\u2019s favourite Dimmeys and Forges brand ambassador Robert DiPierdomenico. The 1980s woollen numbers will set buyers back between an estimated $2,000 and 4,000 (plus buyer\u2019s premium), but what really took our fancy was the lace-up version (nope, still not a great look over the top of a pastel business shirt) and the taxidermy hawk, which we sincerely hope has graced the mantelpiece at Chez Dipper at some stage. And will the eventual buyer make sure that the inanimate pet is soon signed up for a 2016 membership? If you want to find out, as the man himself would say, BE THERE!

I knew life could not continue as normal.\u201d Sitting in Paris\u2019 Gare du Nord waiting for a train to London, the mayor of Paris is living that night again. She frowns and looks pained. It was, of course, the second major terror attack on the French capital in less than a year; Hidalgo knew several of the murdered Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, and was one of the first on the scene that day too. Now the people of Paris were looking to her for guidance again. \u201cThat night, as I tried to console those who survived, I found people wanted to touch,\u201d she says. \u201cThey wanted to hug. It was a very physical need; the need to feel others around them.\u201d Hidalgo describes seeing the dead laid out on the pavement outside the Bataclan: \u201cIt had all been planned, but the killing was so random. When you looked at the names of those who died, you saw they came from everywhere, and in a way this united all Parisians, wherever they were from.\u201d     Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo accompanies German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande as they show their respects to the victims of the November terror attacks. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Imag    At that moment, the old-fashioned socialist policies (she calls them \u201chumanist\u201d) that have bitterly divided the capital since Hidalgo took office were put to one side, as she stepped into the role Rudolph Giuliani took on in New York after 9/11. \u201cShe could have been defeated, but she held the city together,\u201d Mathias Vicherat, her chief of staff, told Lib\u00e9ration. \u201cShe succeeded in finding a balance between the compassion she was clearly feeling and that I could see on her face, and a kind of determination.\u201d Throughout the day that I follow her, Hidalgo demonstrates her fondness for physical contact; continually giving her security team the jitters by breaking away to say hello to fellow Parisians.

Her appearance, like her image, is understated: Hidalgo sports her usual combination of black trousers and matching tailored jacket. There is no expensive jewellery, barely a trace of lipstick, no nail varnish. The mayor is on her way to London with her sports adviser, former rugby international Pierre Rabadan, to watch the Champions League return leg between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. It is a flying visit to London, and she will not be meeting her counterpart Boris Johnson, who she insists \u2013 perhaps a little too strongly \u2013 that she admires: \u201cHe\u2019s such a character, cultivated and intelligent ...\u201d London brings out a competitive streak in Hidalgo, who famously once dismissed the British capital as \u201ca suburb of Paris\u201d. After some petulant huffing from across the Channel, she tactfully added: \u201cSeen from Shanghai, both cities are suburbs of each other\u201d \u2013 but she had made her point.     Anne Hidalgo watches France v Nigeria on a big screen outside Paris City Hall during the 2014 World Cup. Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters    Hidalgo says she is surprised \u2013 and disappointed \u2013 by Johnson\u2019s Brexit campaign, and jokes that she is tempted to turn the tables on him. \u201cRemember when a socialist government was elected, and he offered to roll out the red carpet for French businesses that wanted to leave? I\u2019m going to offer to do the same for British companies if you leave Europe.\u201d She smiles, but it is clear she is only half-joking. Rabadan has recently become a father, and photographs are duly swapped during the journey. Hidalgo, who has two grown-up kids and a teenage son, all of whom have gone through state education, discusses their academic and sporting achievements like any proud maman. She talks warmly about her parents \u2013 father Antonio, an electrician, and mother Marie, a dressmaker \u2013 who live in their native Spain (Hidalgo herself was born near C\u00e1diz), and her elder sister Marie, who is in Los Angeles. Running Paris leaves Hidalgo precious little family time but, after two hectic years in office, she insists it is still her dream job. \u201cIt\u2019s a role where you can really change things on a human level; we are involved in all aspects of people\u2019s daily lives. One minute I am looking at the organisation of public services like creches, childcare and school canteens; the next, wider issues like pollution and street cleaning.\u201d  On an average working day, she will be up at 6.30am to read the newspapers and any reports that need dealing with. She is at her grand office at City Hall overlooking the Seine \u2013 at 155 square metres, the biggest public office in France \u2013 at 8am. Staff say she is rarely home before 11pm, and this particular day she will not get home before 4am. Today has begun with a visit to a \u201cflood crisis centre\u201d, where a simulation of the Seine rising by up to 6.5 metres above normal is being enacted. The exercise sprang out of a wider reflection of how to deal with crises after the November attacks, including flooding. It is not an idle threat: in 1910 after heavy rain, snow and ice, the river, normally around 2m deep, rose to 8.63m, inundating the city\u2019s drainage and sewerage system, sending torrents of foul icy water down the streets and causing 400 million francs \u2013 the equivalent of \u20ac1.6 billion today \u2013 of damage. Experts say it is only a matter of time before the Seine rises again.     Hidalgo attends the Socialist party\u2019s Universit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 summer meeting in La Rochelle. Photograph: Stephane Mahe/Reuters    In the crisis centre, officials jump to their feet as \u201cMadame La Maire\u201d, as she insists on being known (Le Maire is grammatically correct), arrives. \u201cPretend I\u2019m not here,\u201d she tells them, as photographers and camera crew jostle around her. It is day three of the pretend catastrophe: the Seine is 3.2m higher than normal, 210,000 people are without heating, the mobile telephone networks and refuse collection are threatened. Schools will have to close. True to character, Hidalgo asks detailed technical questions; more fodder for those who accuse her of being a technocrat. The officials are delighted. The journalists yawn. Then we are off in the mayoral \u201climousine\u201d \u2013 an electric Renault Zoe \u2013 for a crawl across the city to the 19th arrondissement, where Hidalgo is opening Le Cargo, an immense \u201cdigital business incubator\u201d (the biggest in Europe until the end of this year, when another, Halle Freyssinet, will open in Paris and become the biggest in the world). Attracting new business and global investment is one of the totems of Hidalgo\u2019s programme for the French capital. Where the City of London has marketed itself as the financial capital of Europe, Hidalgo is on a mission to make Paris the continent\u2019s digital hub. Our progress is slowed by demonstrations at the Place de la R\u00e9publique over work reforms proposed by France\u2019s socialist government. Hidalgo, one of the few Parti Socialist figures whose popularity is rising, launches into a critique of the government and certain ministers. She has publicly opposed reforms that have led to clashes between riot police and protesters, claiming the measures will worsen working conditions. \u201cThis, from a left-wing government \u2026 hard to believe,\u201d she says. At Le Cargo, Hidalgo is joined by Valerie Pecresse, a former minister from the centre-right Les Republicains party who, after a surprise victory in December\u2019s local elections, controls the regional council. Pecresse speaks first: her speech is brief, jovial and short on detail. Hidalgo follows: hers is long and serious.  Critics accuse Hidalgo, who took a while to emerge from the shadow of her mentor and City Hall predecessor Bertrand Delan\u00f6e, of having little charisma. She counters: \u201cWhen it comes to taking decisions, if you know the details you know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d     Hidalgo with United Nations special envoy for cities Michael Bloomberg and some of the 500 mayors attending the COP21 climate summit in Paris in December. Photograph: Christophe Morin/Bloomberg via Getty Images    As she leaves, Hidalgo is baited by a TV reporter over her working relationship with Pecresse; it is no secret the two have fundamentally opposed political views and little in common. Hidalgo\u2019s smile drops briefly, and the response is what the French call \u201csec\u201d (curt). \u201cWe have different political ideas, but we work well together,\u201d she says. \u201cI know the media prefers women in politics to be hysterical so they can portray us as aliens, but it\u2019s hard enough already for a woman to get to the top in politics.\u201d With that she smiles, turns and walks off. Before leaving for London, Hidalgo has a hastily scheduled meeting with Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege, who won the 2014 Sakharov Prize for his work with raped and sexually abused women, as well as victims of Female Genital Mutilation. Hidalgo wants to know \u2013 in detail - what she and Paris can do to support the doctor\u2019s work. Her interest is not for the media (apart from The Guardian, none are present) and as the clock ticks, jittery assistants appear at the door, shuffle their feet and look at their watches, but she will not be hurried.  Since taking office two years ago, Hidalgo has set out to change the landscape of French capital with a series of innovative ideas. Her insistence that the city\u2019s wealthier arrondissements must bear their fair share of both social housing and centres for the city\u2019s growing population of homeless and refugees, have proved divisive to the point of public revolt. At one recent meeting in the chic 16th arrondissement, one of Hidalgo\u2019s deputies \u2013 sent to explain details of a proposed centre for the homeless in the area \u2013 was called a \u201ccrook\u201d, \u201ccollaborator\u201d, \u201cbastard\u201d and \u201cson of a bitch\u201d. Hidalgo is clear that housing and pollution are the twin prongs of her mayoral mandate \u2013 and the keys to achieving greater social equality in Paris. Following the success of last September\u2019s first car-free day, this summer a large stretch of highway along the Seine will be closed to vehicles, and eventually transformed into a pedestrian walkway from the Bastille to the Eiffel Tower. The most polluting cars are to be progressively banned from the city.     Hidalgo plans to pedestrianise the right bank of the Seine. Photograph: Luxigon    Paris\u2019s symbolic squares, including Place de la Bastille and Place de la Nation, will also be given makeovers including more pedestrian and cycle space. Motoring organisations are outraged and claim shutting streets to vehicles will gridlock surrounding areas \u2013 adding to, not reducing, pollution. But Hidalgo will not budge on the issue, insisting Parisians have to be weaned off their dependence on private vehicles. And polls show a majority of people support her: even the most divisive, the closure of the Seine highway, is supported by 60% of Parisians. But that\u2019s far from the end of her ambitions. Hidalgo has promised to make all Paris\u2019s public transport electric by 2030, all its public buildings energy efficient by 2050, and has introduced \u201cparticipative democracy\u201d \u2013 an annual poll in which Parisians propose and decide on ideas for 5% of the annual municipal budget (a sum amounting to around \u20ac20 million). \u201cI\u2019ve been elected at a time of major economic crisis, and a crisis of confidence, in France,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to ask how we respond to that, and give added value by being responsible politicians. So we have introduced more participative democracy, with closer relations between the elected, the administration and the people. Parisians are now actors in this process and they often have good solutions. They feel more implicated in their city.\u201d The city, though, is divided, according to a recent poll in the Journal du Dimanche (JDD), which found that 52% of Parisians judged her record since taking office \u201cfavourably\u201d. While this rose to 72% of those who consider themselves left wing, and 60% among the under 35s, on the right, 70% of those asked were \u201cunhappy\u201d with her record. The JDD concluded that this was both \u201cdisappointing and encouraging\u201d for Hidalgo. \u201cOn one side, there\u2019s a Paris that is young and female \u2026 on the other, a Paris that is older and male, settled in the bourgeois arrondissements and very critical [of Hidalgo],\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dabi, of the pollsters IFOP. \u201cShe\u2019s very strongly appreciated by her electorate on the left, and she is, overall, maintaining that support \u2013 which is encouraging for her when you see the catastrophic state of the left at national level.\u201d Hidalgo says she is \u201creflecting\u201d on the criticism, admitting: \u201cSometimes we need to shift boundaries and upset the way things have always been done to become more efficient, but these changes can disturb people.\u201d   Related: Story of cities #12: Haussmann rips up Paris \u2013 and divides France to this day    The mayor is also behind the \u201cReinvent Paris\u201d scheme, an international competition to find environmentally friendly urban designs to transform neglected and run down city-owned sites. If elected president of the C40 global cities group \u2013 she recently announced her candidature \u2013 she hopes to take the idea worldwide. From the ground, however, those details can look like broad brush strokes. One of Parisians\u2019 biggest grouches is how the city seems increasingly grimy: the dog dirt on pavements; the tons of cigarette ends casually tossed into the street (not to mention the flouting of no-smoking laws); the motorcyclists and parked cars on pavements \u2026 the details that blight everyday life.  Hidalgo nods. \u201cI know, I know \u2026 we are looking at these issues. But sometimes there are other priorities.\u201d Paris may be deeply divided along right-left lines, but November\u2019s attacks have made her impatient to be rid of \u201cpetty power games\u201d. She is equally dismissive of any talk of being a future presidential candidate (the current incumbent, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is in freefall in the popularity ratings), insisting \u2013 as most mayors do \u2013 that she has the \u201cbest job in the world\u201d until her mandate ends in 2020. For Hidalgo, it has already been an extraordinary time in office. \u201cParis has changed permanently,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAfter the attacks, there was suddenly a sense of community, of closeness; a need to stand up and be together. I felt that change in people and I can still feel it.

Another victory would extend his lead in the Formula One world championship to more than 20 points. It would also mean he becomes the first driver to win 17 grands prix without securing a world championship; he is currently tied with Stirling Moss on 16. Rosberg, who finished ahead of his Mercedes team-mate, Lewis Hamilton, in both practice sessions on Friday, would also become the fourth driver to win six consecutive races, joining Sebastian Vettel (nine), Alberto Ascari (seven) and Michael Schumacher (six).   Related: Fernando Alonso passed fit for Chinese Grand Prix after further tests    Even after winning the last three races of 2015 and the first two of 2016, there is the reflex response to view his triumphs in the context of Hamilton\u2019s failures; the two men are still young (Hamilton 31, Rosberg 30), but they are such long-standing rivals that they help define each other, like enemies from the vaults of history. While Rosberg won in Australia and Bahrain, it is Hamilton\u2019s poor starts from pole position in those races that have been given a higher profile. In Melbourne, the German finished the race eight seconds ahead of Hamilton, who had to battle back to second after slipping from first to sixth on the opening lap. In Bahrain, Rosberg again capitalised when Hamilton started sluggishly and was involved in a crash with Valtteri Bottas on the opening corner. It is Rosberg\u2019s misfortune that we are often blinded to his excellence by the starbursts of Hamilton\u2019s brilliance, but he is quick enough and good enough to be a world champion and if he has another good Sunday the suspicion will grow that this could well be his year. If Rosberg has form on his side in China, Hamilton can fall back on history. He has won here four times, in 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2015. But a Ferrari one-two in Friday\u2019s second practice run, led by Kimi Raikkonen, suggested the red cars are in the mood to gatecrash any Mercedes party and in Hamilton\u2019s case the party will be hard simply to get into given he has acquired a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. Rosberg, though, when asked about his admirable start to the season, played down its significance: \u201cIt\u2019s two races into the longest F1 season we\u2019ve ever had, with 21 races,\u201d he said. He knows well enough how the dynamic can shift over the course of the season. In 2014, Rosberg won the opening grand prix in Australia and Hamilton retired, giving the Briton a 25-point deficit to overcome in the drivers\u2019 standings after one race. The pair were embroiled in a season-long battle for the championship when the lead flipped between the two. Hamilton secured the title in the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. Is luck finally smiling on Rosberg now? \u201cThoughts like that don\u2019t cross my mind because it\u2019s just early days,\u201d he said, and we were expected to believe him. When asked again about his \u201cluck\u201d he replied: \u201cSorry, no, I can\u2019t see those thought patterns at all, because I\u2019m just looking at getting my job done at the moment. With all due respect, I appreciate your opinion.\u201d He didn\u2019t show annoyance but he might have felt it. Rosberg is good enough to win F1 races, if not the title, without luck. \u201cNico is in a good place,\u201d said the Mercedes motor sport boss, Toto Wolff, on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t see him oscillating a lot. He is developing as a person and a race driver.\u201d     Nico Rosberg climbs the pit wall to wave to fans after the second practice session in Shanghai. Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP    One other point of inspiration for Rosberg is that it all started for him here, in 2012. He took pole when he beat Hamilton by more than half a second and then won his maiden grand prix, finishing more than 20 seconds ahead of the second-placed Jenson Button. Hamilton meanwhile, appears to be going out of his way to show he is not spooked by Rosberg\u2019s run, even though his last victory is slipping beyond short-term memory \u2013 it was in Austin last October, when he won his third world title. His next triumph will come as an enormous relief, but he has been a study in relaxed amiability as he prepares for Sunday\u2019s race. He may be very emotional, but he is also mentally strong these days. This is his 10th season in Formula One, but he still sounded like a giddy debutant when he talked about his sport. \u201cIt is the greatest form of racing, the coolest form of motor racing,\u201d he said. \u201cF1 has the fastest cars, the biggest teams, the biggest following, the greatest races, the greatest physical and mental challenges \u2013 but I just love getting into the car. If you could see me giggle when I pull out of the garage. I almost lost my voice after that pole lap in Bahrain and that is a feeling that is priceless.\u201d Hamilton was not giggling after those slow starts in the opening two races. He has not mastered the single, left-handed paddle clutch \u2013 last year the drivers used both hands. He said: \u201cIn the past we had two paddles, which did exactly the same thing. You let one out, and then you let the other out. But there is not much difference. We just do the same sequence with one hand. You can use both hands in a pit stop, but I prefer one hand in a pit stop, so no difference really. But the simulator doesn\u2019t really simulate what you experience in a race.\u201d While the starting issue is unlikely to have as much of an impact for Hamilton here given the grid penalty, and notwithstanding how the Ferrari stacks up on race day, the scenario is unlikely to change much this season; it\u2019s still Hamilton v Rosberg, but Rosberg is close to making it very interesting.", "tags": ["Formula One 2016", "Nico Rosberg", "Lewis Hamilton", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-15T15:00:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/15/jenson-button-disappointed-f1-nico-rosberg-lewis-hamilton", "sentences": ["Chinese Grand Prix: everything you need to know about the Shanghai circuit    \u201cWe have no ulterior motive."], "title": "Jenson Button disappointed that drivers seeking F1 reform not being heard", "article": "Leading Formula One drivers have been left angry and frustrated that their plea for reform has been dismissed by those in charge.

It\u2019s up to people to reply in the right manner and try to move forward and make this sport better than it is.

We\u2019re not the right people to make decisions about what happens. But we can help and it seems that it needs help. \u201cThe thing is I think 90% of the fans agree with us and this sport needs its fans. People who are making decisions need help from someone who is in love with this sport and not just here for business. Whether that\u2019s going to happen or not, I don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s a lot of interest in what we said and the response hasn\u2019t been what we expected \u2013 or probably was what we expected \u2013 but hopefully we can move forward from this and we can help improve.\u201d Nico Rosberg, another of the most experienced and articulate drivers, said: \u201cWe want to try and support F1 with opinions and give it a little bit of direction. We know best. We\u2019re in the car. Nobody else really knows, so we really can help and we also think we have a really good understanding of what everybody else at home is looking for.\u201d Rosberg and Button were backed up by the three-times world champion Lewis Hamilton, who called for changes to the weekend race format. \u201cThere are so many things we need to do and we need to experiment but, unfortunately, I don\u2019t see anything positive happening,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the past 10 years, it has been the same Thursday through to Sunday and jeez, I love the driving but if the format was different, we could please the people. They just shouldn\u2019t be afraid to try things. No new ideas have come out since we dropped qualifying. \u201cThis year is an opportunity to come up with some new ideas, test some things.

But in terms of sheer performance, they are really pushing us. And that it good; this is how the competition should be.\u201d Ferrari have made a step-up from last season but are still dissatisfied with their position. Raikkonen, who had at one stage looked likely to achieve pole here, was disappointed that Ferrari had only seemed strong on the supersoft tyre the day before. \u201cFor whatever reason we\u2019ve been quite struggling apart from the super-soft tyre,\u201d he said. Tyres, alas, have been a talking point more than ever here, because the Shanghai track is a real rubber-shredder. Vettel was also downbeat going into the pointy end of the weekend. \u201cOverall I think we can still improve, but the balance is not yet where I want it to be, so let\u2019s see what we can do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feel is OK, but OK is not good, so we can still improve.\u201d     Vettel celebrates his win in Hungary with Ferrari technical director James Allison, one of the team\u2019s three wins in a2015. Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images    Again it was tyres that dominated discussions after qualification: that Ferrari would have to start the Chinese Grand Prix wearing worn super-softs was thought to be a possible tactical blunder. But this is something more fundamental than rubber. Ferrari, searching for their first victory here since 2013, have looked at everything in the buildup to the new campaign. Their technical director, James Allison, whose fingerprints are all over this SF16-H car for the first time, said in Melbourne they had taken a bold approach to everything \u2013 power unit, downforce, handling, horsepower, the lot \u2013 in an aggressive attempt to further improve on their 2015 model, which had been a big step up from the jalopy of 2014. And to support Allison, the former senior Mercedes engineer Jock Clear has moved over to Maranello. Ferrari\u2019s principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, said here: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in Australia and Bahrain, we explained it very, very well and I think I don\u2019t need to give further explanation.\u201d After that, he seemed more interested in patting Mercedes on the back.           F1 Chinese GP guide: everything you need to know about the Shanghai circuit     \u201cConcerning the expectation of the season,\u201d he said, \u201cI can say the Mercedes team of this year is the strongest one that I saw in the last 10 years. It\u2019s quite a lot of years that I\u2019m around. To be able to win against them, you have to work and be better than them. So, we are doing all our best to have good results.\u201d Considering Mercedes\u2019 relentless hegemony, Ferrari did not have bad results last year. Three wins and second in the constructors\u2019 championship would have pleased most teams, but this is Ferrari. That even Raikkonen is fractionally more animated this season is further evidence that Ferrari have moved forward. But, like last year, they still look a team more likely to take victories off Mercedes than win the title themselves. Mercedes still look the team likelier to prevail in November.

Late on Sunday afternoon, however, as a gloaming began to close on Shanghai\u2019s International Circuit and he was forced to consider the consequences of Nico Rosberg\u2019s third successive Formula One win this season and the fact that he was suddenly 36 points behind in the world championship, it seemed there was a real danger of a forlornness infiltrating his soul.   Related: F1: Nico Rosberg wins dramatic Chinese Grand Prix to extend championship lead    There are, of course, 18 races to go in this longest F1 year in the sport\u2019s history. But the notion that luck always evens itself out over a season is a flawed one. This could be Rosberg\u2019s lucky year \u2013 it is possible to come to the end of a long life and still register an imbalance in the columns of good and bad fortune. Hamilton was a little quieter now, as the crouching, ugly concrete monster of the main grandstand disgorged its spectators, who teemed towards the Shanghai Metro congratulating themselves that they had just watched the best race of the season. The three-times world champion, who had failed to get the rub of the tarmac in the first two races in Australia and Bahrain, entered the weekend with a five-place grid penalty hanging over him because of a gearbox replacement but still expecting to have a good race from sixth or seventh place. Even his relegation to the back of the grid on Saturday, after he was unable to set a timed lap in qualifying because of a problem with his power unit, did not leave him unduly disheartened. On Sunday, though, Hamilton could do no better than seventh place. He made a charging start, bursting through the back of the field so effectively that going into the first corner he had already made up five places. But then, after running over a piece of Kimi Raikkonen\u2019s front wing, he was hit by Felipe Nasr, who was himself trying to avoid another collision. Hamilton made three pit stops in the first 15 minutes of the race, one for repairs on his front wing, one to shoe himself with supersofts for a single lap and another to return to softs. In the end he made five stops. Repeatedly he charged through the field, only to lose ground with another stop. He resembled some thoroughbred favourite, galloping over Aintree\u2019s acres but held back by too heavy weights. \u201cThere\u2019s a long, long way to go,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cLots can happen. It is just I don\u2019t have any more jokers available really. \u201cIt was a pretty horrifying race really but there were some good experiences, there was some good overtaking. There are lots of different emotions and thoughts going through my mind as I see the season start the wrong way. But this is a part of motor racing. This is a part of the journey. These experiences bring us closer, make us stronger, myself, my mechanics, my engineers. \u201cAs I\u2019m talking right now, I definitely don\u2019t feel the dark cloud I\u2019ve had over me in the past. Of course it\u2019s a trying time. I got a good start, there was great overtaking \u2013 I can still overtake! There\u2019s lots of positives to take from today. I ultimately wasn\u2019t able to show all my ability in terms of pure pace because of the damaged car. I\u2019ll go away, come back. We fell this weekend. We\u2019ll get up and try harder in the next one.\u201d Rosberg, who sauntered home 37.7 seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel, may be surprised to learn that it was a chaotically enthralling race. He was like some senior officer, far removed from the cut and thrust of the trench warfare. He joins only three men who have won six successive races, Vettel (9), Alberto Ascari (7) and Michael Schumacher (6).   Related: Chinese Grand Prix 2016 \u2014 in pictures    He has another, less welcome record: with 17 F1 victories he has now overtaken Stirling Moss as the most successful driver without a world championship. He was, briefly, overtaken by Daniel Ricciardo going into Turn 1, where there was mayhem, with the Ferraris of Vettel and Raikkonen coming together following an aggressive move from Daniil Kvyat, who finished third. Vettel condemned Kvyat over the team radio and the spat continued after the race. Rosberg, who has not overtaken anyone in his three wins except off the grid, regained the lead on the third lap when Ricciardo sustained a left-rear puncture as he came into contact with debris. He and Vettel have probably been the most impressive drivers over the weekend, though once again Rosberg was immaculate. In the Mercedes motorhome Toto Wolff attempted to disentangle the mess of the race. The team\u2019s motorsport director said: \u201cLewis made a good start. Then he became a victim of the tangling between the Ferraris. The Sauber then made a move to avoid Raikkonen, hit him hard and the front wing was damaged, losing a huge amount of downforce. \u201cWe then tried to figure out a strategy that could help him make it back up to maximum P4 or P5 max. We pitted him, then pitted him again, to give him more options at the end. But it was damage limitation in the end.\u201d So, was Rosberg now favourite? Diplomatically, he replied: \u201cNo. It is just three out of 21, so statistically there is so much more to come, so you can\u2019t speak about any favourite.\u201d Hamilton was asked how he felt. \u201cHow do you expect me to feel? Obviously the damage on the car had that domino effect,\u201d he said with a philosophical shrug. \u201cIt was a pretty horrifying race. It doesn\u2019t feel any nicer than it did back then [2014, when he also trailed Rosberg before winning the title]. If anything it probably feels worse because it\u2019s just gone one negative after the other.\u201d Then he brightened when told he was now 36 points behind Rosberg. \u201cIs it 50 points now,\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, 36, OK.

We are having an ideal situation with great racing and three great races in a row now. Are we capable of reacting quickly enough and acknowledging that and reverting to regulations which seem to be OK now? I don\u2019t know.\u201d When F1 changed the qualifying rules at the start of the season it proved to be a disaster and old-style qualifying returned at Shanghai to everyone\u2019s relief. Now F1 could be heading for more changes that will not work. It has been a memorable start to the season. The Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday was even better than the season-opener in Melbourne, while the second race in Bahrain was decent enough. The plan for 2017 is to make cars three seconds a lap faster by increasing aero and mechanical grip. The thrust is for wider tyres and wings, and a bigger diffuser. There will be more downforce but that is expected to make overtaking more difficult, and will come into conflict with the work done by the Overtaking Working Group. Wolff said: \u201cEven if it is uncomfortable for the commercial rights holder that Mercedes have been running away with lots of the races and two championships, the longer you keep the regulations stable the more the performance is going to converge between everybody, and this is what is happening now. The gains we are making are smaller because the curve flattens out and the others are making bigger steps.\u201d Wolff has a point. Ferrari, despite enduring three frustrating races, appear to be faster and more competitive, while Red Bull are getting stronger by the race. Mercedes still lead the field but it is getting tighter, while the new tyre rules have added another variable to the mix. Despite all the gloomy words from F1\u2019s chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, before the start of the season, it has been a good show so far. Wolff\u2019s warning is that another change now will create \u201canother Mercedes\u201d with one team \u2013 possibly them \u2013 making a better fist of the job than anyone else, and running away with the title. He added: \u201cSomebody else, or us, are going to run away with the championship next year because it is new regulations and everything starts from the beginning. There will be more downforce and less overtaking. \u201cThere is nothing to be sold on that. There is no selling proposition within the regulations in my opinion. We should just leave it alone. We don\u2019t have the advantage we had last year but the racing is great and it will become even greater if we leave the regulations alone.\u201d Formula One can never leave anything alone. But the current system, using hybrid V6 engines, is in its third year and could be finally delivering, though there are still fundamental problems to address concerning the sport\u2019s finances and governance.", "tags": ["Mercedes GP", "Formula One 2016", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-18T13:46:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/18/porsche-inherit-audi-silverstone-win-fia-world-endurance-championship-disqualified", "sentences": ["That Audi at least had closed the gap on their rivals was clear in qualifying on Saturday, with a one-two that ended Porsche\u2019s run of pole positions that had stretched back to the Shanghai race in 2014."], "title": "Porsche inherit Audi's Silverstone win at FIA World Endurance Championship", "article": "That the racing at the opening round of the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship would be intense was never in doubt; the ultimate result of the meeting, however, proved more elusive. At the end of a frenetic and incident-packed six hours on Sunday, it was the No7 Audi of Marcel F\u00e4ssler, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer that took the chequered flag, the marque\u2019s first win since the second round at Spa last year. Their celebrations were short-lived, however, after the car was deemed to have broken sporting regulations by the stewards in post-race scrutineering, giving the victory to the second-placed Porsche No2 of Neel Jani, Romain Dumas and Marc Lieb.   Related: Porsche win Le Mans 24 Hours race for the 17th time    The Audi R18 e-tron quattro, an entirely new car for this year\u2019s championship, was excluded for wear beyond the permitted 5mm on the front skid block. The team offered an explanation to the stewards but it was rejected, with the statement that: \u201cit is the liability of the competitor to respect the technical regulations in any case in order that the car complies with this regulation\u201d. In the early hours of Monday morning Audi announced that they would lodge an appeal against the decision. Win or lose, and it appears unlikely that, having already put their case to the stewards, the decision will be overturned, the team will remain buoyed by their performance at Silverstone. Last year Porsche dominated the championship from their win at the Le Mans 24 Hours onwards, prompting both Audi and Toyota, their rivals in the top LMP1 prototype class, to build entirely new cars for this season, while Porsche continued with an upgraded iteration of their successful 919 Hybrid. That Audi at least had closed the gap on their rivals was clear in qualifying on Saturday, with a one-two that ended Porsche\u2019s run of pole positions that had stretched back to the Shanghai race in 2014. The No7 squad had battled the No2 car to the finish, with little to chose between them in pace, but with the gap down to six seconds in Audi\u2019s favour in the last hour, a puncture forced an unscheduled stop for the Porsche compounded by having to take a splash and dash seven laps from the end, giving the Audi the win by 46 seconds. Immediately after the race and before the result was overturned, Lotterer was cheered by the first competitive run for the new R18: \u201cIt is amazing that at this stage of the programme we have been able to win a race,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had luck on our side because the No1 Porsche had its accident but that is part of motorsport.\u201d Indeed it was the sister No1 Porsche of Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley and Mark Webber, last year\u2019s world champions, that had the advantage and the pace early in the race. Webber had opened with a charging start, taking the lead in the first hour and building a gap at the front. At the opening of the third hour, his team-mate Hartley had a 40-second advantage, when he was involved in a huge crash at Farm. Hartley was later reprimanded for the collision that occurred when he tried to go round the outside of Michael Wainwright\u2019s GTE Am Porsche and turned in too soon, causing the pair to clash. Hartley\u2019s car was tipped on to its side and only prevented from completely rolling over by the GT car underneath it. Wainwright took a big impact in the tyre wall but both drivers emerged unscathed. Audi too only managed to finish with one car after the No8 of Lucas di Grassi, Lo\u00efc Duval and Oliver Jarvis had to retire on lap 70 after a problem with the energy retrieval system. Toyota had struggled with set-up for qualifying with their new TS050 but after a slow start to the race brought the No6 of St\u00e9phane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi up to speed as the running progressed. Their third place became a second after Audi\u2019s disqualification. The sister car of Anthony Davidson, S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima, suffered a puncture at the halfway mark that caused substantial damage to the bodywork that forced them down the field, although the car did return to finish in 17th. The team know they have more work to do to compete with their rivals but a fastest lap that was just over three-tenths off the best of the race suggests they are not far from making this a real three-way fight. A fight that will continue on 7 May at Spa in the final race before this year\u2019s Le Mans, which is looking far from being a foregone conclusion for Porsche. Certainly the growing number of fans (with 52,000 at Silverstone over the weekend) appreciate the competitiveness that comes with the open technical regulations the WEC employs. While there has been some closing in the philosophy of designs this year, interpretations remain diverse in a formula that continues to cut fuel consumption, with the total reduced by 7% for 2016. Porsche\u2019s upgraded 919 has stuck with the the V4, two-litre, turbo petrol engine, allied to a front axle and turbine Kers. Toyota have switched to V6 twin-turbo, petrol engine with twin axle Kers; while Audi have opted for a V6, single-turbo, diesel, partnered with a single front axle Kers. For the moment, Porsche\u2019s tried and tested hybrid has the advantage, and the result, but the evidence from Silverstone is that they will not be allowed to run away with the championship this year.", "tags": ["World Endurance Championship", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-18T16:05:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/the-fallout-from-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-in-brazil-will-be-global", "sentences": ["When the New Development Bank was set up in Shanghai for the Brics \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 it was designed to challenge the dominance of the World Bank in international development."], "title": "The fallout from Dilma Rousseff's impeachment will reach beyond Brazil | Richard Bourne", "article": "It is worth standing back from the impeachment proceedings in Brazil, and impending regime change, to ask: \u201cWhat does this mean for Brazil\u2019s standing in the world?\u201d Notoriously, Charles de Gaulle is said to have dismissed the country as not serious, but a place for samba, carnival and playboys. And, until the military dictatorship died in the 1980s and Fernando Henrique Cardoso sorted out the currency and killed inflation in the 1990s, it lacked the conditions to become a world power. All that has changed now and a great deal is thanks to the Workers\u2019 party (PT) governments of presidents Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (2003-11) and the embattled Dilma Rousseff (2011 onwards). It was mostly thanks to Lula, who won the presidency at the fourth attempt after ditching overt socialism. He travelled tirelessly, especially around Africa, to build alliances of developing states and a distinctive independent line. This was south-south, with strong hints of anti-Americanism.    Will the inward-looking deputies and senators remember that Brazil is not an island, but rather part of Latin America?    This paid off. Brazil was recognised as a key player in the G20 and saw its citizens elected to international posts \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva become secretary general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2012; Roberto Azevedo became director general of the World Trade Organisation in 2013. When the New Development Bank was set up in Shanghai for the Brics \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 it was designed to challenge the dominance of the World Bank in international development. Capturing both the World Cup and the Olympics within two years was an achievement which rewarded Lula\u2019s skill in mobilising sporting bodies, civil society and the media. The fact that some stadia are white elephants has haunted his successor. In Latin America itself the PT governments worked to bring together the sub-regional groups which serve the southern cone, and the Andean states. In 2008 in Brasilia it was agreed to set up the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), loosely modelled on the EU; based in Quito this would have 12 ministerial councils, a parliamentary assembly and its own bank. Like the EU it has had teething troubles.           Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff faces impeachment \u2013 video explainer    Outsiders saw a red tide flowing through South America \u2013 of the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, the Kirchners in Argentina, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and, of course, Lula in Brazil. But although each shared a commitment to national sovereignty their politics were far from identical and there could be frictions, as when Morales nationalised oil and gas and put supplies to Brazil at risk. Lula had warm relations with Ch\u00e1vez; Dilma, while supporting the election of his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has never had quite the same closeness. So what will happen now? Brazil\u2019s economy is in decline, threatening the PT success in bringing the poor into a \u201cnew middle class\u201d. The publicity surrounding the Petrobras scandal and the way in which the impeachment has been pressed for by the right could lead cynics to aver that one set of crooks has conspired to throw out another. Along the way Brazil\u2019s international reputation and capacity for progressive diplomacy have been damaged. It is not clear that the country will gain respect for a house-cleaning unless all the corrupt politicos are thrown out and, while there are problems about getting rid of an inadequate executive president ahead of term in the many states which have such presidencies, the current example in Brasilia looks partisan.   Related: Brazil is going through an identity crisis, not just an impeachment | Eliane Blum    For the world needs Brazil. For years the ability of its diplomats, centred in the beautiful Niemeyer building in Brasilia, which has now been witnessing anti-Rousseff demonstrations, has been admired. Geographically and politically it is the hinge on which its predominantly Spanish-speaking neighbours must turn. There are issues it can help resolve. For example, in 2015 Venezuela suddenly claimed to annexe nearly all the maritime waters off Guyana, also threatening the exclusive economic zones of eight other states including Colombia. It then backed down with Colombia, but ordered its navy to arrest vessels off Guyana, including an Exxon-Mobil survey ship which was looking for oil and gas in recognised Guyanese waters. Venezuela has revived a claim to two-thirds of Guyana \u2013 territory which neither it nor its Spanish imperial predecessors have ever occupied. Carl Greenidge, vice-president of Guyana, told a Ramphal Institute audience in London on Monday that this was straightforward bullying. The original Guyana-Venezuela border was arbitrated at the turn of the 20th century with Brazil as a guarantor of the resulting line. The last thing Brazil wants is a recurrence of boundary disputes around its periphery, fuelled by greed for oil and minerals, and an active foreign policy can help to calm this controversy. But with the stasis in Brasilia will the inward-looking deputies and senators remember that Brazil is not an island, but rather part of Latin America? It is certainly true that, particularly thanks to Lula\u2019s energy and flair, Brazilians are now regarded as world citizens.

According to reports in the Chinese media, more than 20 primary school children at the Hai\u2019an Chengnan Experimental Primary School in Jiangsu province have complained of rashes and other medial complaints in recent days.

The headmaster of the Hai\u2019an Chengnan Experimental Primary School, who was named only as Mr Wu, told The Paper he did not know how many of his school\u2019s 1,500 students had been affected.

According to the multibillion-pound blueprint, China, which already boasts the world\u2019s largest football academy, will have 20,000 specialist football academies and more than 30 million students regularly playing the sport by 2020. By 2050, Xi, who spin doctors claim is a football fanatic, hopes his country will be capable of hosting \u2013 and perhaps even lifting \u2013 the World Cup. Sun Aijun, the chairman of Rosa\u2019s new side, Xinjiang Tianshan Leopard FC, said he was convinced Brazil\u2019s samba boys could help propel his League One club into the top flight, the Chinese Super League, and transform the Chinese game by sharing their skills with homegrown footballers.

Just look at my team \u2013 we have three of them,\u201d said Sun, a property magnate who is planning his first trip to the South American country this year.  Asked to explain his fondness for Brazilian imports, Sun grinned: \u201cAs far as I know, Brazil has a population of 200 million: 100 million of them play football and the other 100 million are football managers. Everyone in Brazil loves football.\u201d Professional players have been swapping Brazil \u2013 home to the \u201cjogo bonito\u201d or \u201cbeautiful game\u201d \u2013 for China \u2013 whose national team Fifa ranks 81st in the world, below Benin, Belarus, Israel and Zambia \u2013 for about two decades. Among the first to arrive, in 1995, was Marcelo Marmelo da Silva, a nimble-footed midfielder who traded Rio for Sichuan province and became known as China\u2019s \u201cblack butterfly\u201d. But in recent years that trickle has turned into a torrent.     Leopards fans. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Chinese clubs \u2013 often bankrolled by cash-flush state-owned enterprises or real estate firms \u2013 reportedly splashed out $373m on foreign players in the latest transfer window, including some of Brazil\u2019s biggest stars. Recent imports include Alex Teixeira (sold to Jiangsu Suning in February for \u00a338.4m), Ramires (sold to the same team a month earlier for \u00a325m), Gil (sold to Shandong Luneng for about \u00a37.8m) and Diego Tardelli (also sold to Shandong Luneng in January 2015 for a more modest \u00a34.3m). According to the Brazilian FA, 31 Brazilian players moved to China in 2014 and 2015. Top Brazilian managers including Luiz Felipe Scolari, Vanderlei Luxemburgo and Mano Menezes are also flocking east, with the latter reportedly earning in excess of \u00a3300,000 each month to manage Shandong Luneng. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they have discovered a goldmine,\u201d Luis Paulo Rosenberg, the former vice-president of the S\u00e3o Paulo club Corinthians, said of the way his fellow countrymen were invading the Middle Kingdom. When the Bahia-born striker Vicente de Paula Neto first came to China in 2004 there were just three Brazilians in Chinese teams.  \u201cIt was tough. There were hardly any,\u201d said Vicente, now 36, who learned his trade in Salvador\u2019s impoverished and violence-stricken Cabula neighbourhood and is now the longest-serving Brazilian in professional Chinese football.      Vicente de Paula Neto. Photograph: Christy Yao    \u201cToday there are more than 30, if you put both the first and second divisions together. Thank God the market is growing and no doubt there will be more Brazilians arriving to boost the Chinese league even more.\u201d De Paula, who also plays for Xinjiang\u2019s Leopards and is known to Chinese commentators as Wei Sente, has become a fans\u2019 favourite since joining the club in 2013. After a hard-fought victory one freezing night last November the jubilant forward sprinted off the pitch and hurled his shirt, shorts, socks and boots into the crowd, Sun, the chairman, recalled. \u201cAll he was left with was his underwear. It was so cold! Have you ever seen anything like this before? Everyone loves him. The Brazilian passion is a real inspiration for us.\u201d Despite fears that the arrival of so many foreigners might rob opportunities from young Chinese players, De Paula said emerging Chinese talents would benefit from the skills that his country\u2019s players offered. \u201cNothing compares to the Brazilian technique: the trickery, the cunning. I think this is really valuable to [the Chinese players]. They are fast. Some of them are skilful. But there are still some things they need to add to their game to get to a high level.\u201d For Brazilian players, moving to China is mostly about boosting their bank balances.  Rosenberg, who brought the first Chinese footballer to a Brazilian club in 2012, said most players saw football as an elevator to lift their families from poverty. \u201cPlaying in Brazil helps take them from the ground floor to the fifth,\u201d he said. \u201cThen suddenly along comes a Chinese guy and takes them to the 40th.\u201d Rosa, who has three children and a wife back in Brazil, admits his almost 10,000-mile move from Florian\u00f3polis to Xinjiang was not driven by a burning desire to explore the ancient Silk Road.

Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    \u201cLet\u2019s be honest about it, it\u2019s the money,\u201d he says during a break from his first training session at the Xinjiang Sports Centre Stadium. \u201cFootball is growing here and, like it or not, this is where they are paying well. That\u2019s why everyone is coming. It\u2019s too good to turn down.\u201d Rosenberg said the chance to snap up South American proponents of the beautiful game was also irresistible for China, particularly in the wake of Brazil\u2019s dramatic economic slump and the plunge of its currency which meant even top players were now comparatively cheap.  \u201cThe Chinese players who are playing alongside these Brazilians will see a different type of football and this will help them grow to reach the same level.\u201d Rosenberg claimed Xi\u2019s football revolution, coupled with the arrival of foreign reinforcements, meant China\u2019s woeful national side would, in the not-too-distant future, rival Brazil\u2019s storied \u201csele\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen.

In an interview with the Brazilian media, Tardelli, a Brazilian international who lives in Shandong\u2019s capital, Jinan, complained of the limited leisure options in his new home \u2013 \u201ctwo shopping malls, that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 and admitted he was still baffled by some aspects of Chinese life.  \u201cThe Chinese have a very odd habit of allowing their young kids to pee anywhere,\u201d Tardelli said. \u201cThe other day I was having a scan at the hospital when a mum opened the zipper on her kid\u2019s crawler and he had a wee right in the middle of the hospital!\u201d Rosa, who lives in a three-star hotel in downtown Urumqi, said he had initially been nervous about moving to China\u2019s western frontier having read about the security situation in a region notorious for deadly ethnic riots and terrorist attacks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen tanks in the street, near the shopping centre, near the hotel we are in,\u201d the footballer said of his first week in the city, where dozens died in a May 2014 bomb attack that authorities blamed on Islamic extremists from Xinjiang\u2019s Uighur ethnic minority. More accustomed to rice and beans, Rosa said he was also struggling with the cuisine. \u201cThere\u2019s so much spice: spice, spice, spice, spice,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Vicente: \u2018I can\u2019t take any more!\u2019\u201d But with his first home game less than 24 hours away Rosa said he was focused on the football not the food. \u201cWe are here to work and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d The following afternoon the midfielder strode out on to the pitch of Xinjiang\u2019s 40,000-seater stadium for his home debut, a potentially thorny tie against Shanghai Shenxin FC whose team sheet also boasted a Brazilian \u2013 a pacy 21-year-old from the gritty suburbs of Rio called Biro-Biro or, to Chinese fans, Biluo Biluo. More than 5,000 Leopards supporters filled the stands, some waving banners that read: \u201cWe fight with you!\u201d and \u201cXinjiang is here!\u201d, others wearing cowboy hats in the yellow and green of the Brazilian flag.

Biro-Biro flicked the ball through to a Chinese teammate who was scythed down as he advanced on the goal.  Goalkeeper Gu Junjie clawed away the subsequent penalty, however, and 10 minutes later the Leopards were ahead after a cross from the right, disputed by the towering Rosa, clattered into the net off defender Cai Xi.  Fans were still celebrating their opener when a quickly taken free kick \u2013 masterminded by the injured Vicente and executed by the Chinese player Yan Zhiyu \u2013 crept into the net putting the home side 2-0 up.

So it is intriguing to learn that this work, depicting a timeless spiritual quest for \u201casceticism and quietude\u201d, is a characteristic offering from a company that emerged from one of the most turbulent periods of modern Asian geopolitics. For decades following the end of China\u2019s civil war in 1949 the Taiwanese regime led by Chiang Kai-shek had claimed to be the legitimate government of all China, but international recognition gradually eroded and in 1971 it was expelled from the United Nations. Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min was studying in the United States at the time and found himself returning home to an island in which a whole generation were suddenly trying to discover who they were. \u201cThere was a lot of energy in literature and the visual arts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I set up Cloud Gate [named after an ancient Chinese dance] we were the first professional dance company. We felt part of a movement in search of its roots. In one respect the mission of the company was to explore what it is to be Taiwanese, as we knew so little about our own home.\u201d     Wang Rong-yu in the part of the Monk in Songs of the Wanderers. Photograph: Yu Hui-hung    At the company\u2019s new theatre, which opened last year on the outskirts of the capital Taipei, Lin gestures in the direction of the Chinese mainland, 110 miles across the Taiwan Straits. \u201cWhat was important was over there\u201d, he says. Well into the 80s Taiwanese children were taught about Beijing and the Great Wall and how long the Yangtze was. But, says Lin, \u201cwe had no idea about the rivers in Taiwan. It just wasn\u2019t in the textbooks. Today you can go to a store and buy half a dozen books on the butterflies of Taiwan, but back then we had to explore for ourselves. City people travelled to the country to see the landscape, the farms, the rituals being carried out in front of the temples.\u201d Lin\u2019s response was to develop a form of modern dance that, while open to western and other influences, was intrinsically indigenous in its movements and imagery. He notes the same comparisons between boxing and martial arts as between classical ballet and the work he wanted to produce. \u201cIn both boxing and ballet you\u2019re tense all the time. In our dance, and in martial arts, you are relaxed in preparation for moments of great intensity. You make a gesture and then you subside again like a wave. And we don\u2019t try to elevate and defy gravity. We submit to gravity and attempt to find a harmony with the earth. When we tour abroad the reaction is always the same for new western audiences. For five minutes they are a little confused and fidgety, and then they find the rhythm and become still themselves. This is not work projected out at an audience, it is work that draws an audience in.\u201d Cloud Gate occupies a unique space in Taiwanese culture and society. Its open-air summer shows attract audiences of up to 40,000 people. Its logo has appeared on the livery of China Airlines as well as on Taipei metro trains and buses. Lin, universally known as Mr Lin, has national treasure status and on the streets of Taipei is repeatedly stopped by people simply wanting to say \u201cthank you\u201d to him. He says he has become used to the attention and is proud that his work evokes such public warmth. But even he was taken aback when, as we talk at a secluded restaurant in the hills above Taipei, a fellow diner came over to his table to offer three days\u2019 free treatment at a Shanghai hospital, if Mr Lin ever needed it. Lin was born in Taiwan in 1947, the eldest of five children of Taiwanese parents who had been educated in Tokyo during Japanese control of the island. \u201cWe were brought up basically as Japanese kids with quite severe discipline,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMy parents spoke Japanese. We knelt on tatami. I was a mixture to begin with. A multicultural bastard.\u201d His parents brought western, Japanese and Chinese culture into the home. They had pictures of Goethe and Beethoven on the wall and he enjoyed Japanese tales, songs and Samurai films. By his teens Lin was also into Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald and Jackson Pollock. \u201cWe were from a village in the south, and although a gentry family we were familiar with the land and rice paddies. That was a part of me too.\u201d    There was a hunger for dance. Whether we drew on folk tales or history, it was all part of our aud\u00adience\u2019s lives    Despite this interest in the arts, it was always assumed Lin would go into a profession and he duly studied law at university. But within a year he had switched to journalism, for which he felt better suited having been contributing to magazines since the age of 14. \u201cI always had more pocket money than other kids to buy books or go to movies.\u201d He then went to study in America and won a scholarship to the renowned writers\u2019 workshop in Iowa. When he eventually returned to Taiwan he taught creative writing and journalism and published several novels. But more significantly, it was in America that Lin began a serious engagement with dance. His interest was first sparked at the age of five, when he saw the Powell and Pressburger film version of Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s tale about a ballerina, The Red Shoes, on TV. (Matthew Bourne has just announced that he will be choreographing a new stage version of the story this year). In America Lin began to take modern dance classes, including at the Martha Graham school in New York. When he returned to Taiwan in 1971 he met some young dancers, who wanted him to teach them. \u201cThen of course they wanted to perform, and so in 1973 Cloud Gate began. We had to pay for so many things I was on the verge of a breakdown after the first season,\u201d he says. \u201cBut fortunately we were young and stupid. If we had been sophisticated and calculating we never would have started.\u201d The company caught the public imagination from the outset, selling out its first two performances in a 3,000 seat venue. \u201cThere was a hunger for dance and we connected with people by doing our own thing. This wasn\u2019t Swan Lake. Whether we drew on folk tales or history or calligraphy, it was all recognisably part of our audience\u2019s lives.\u201d Lin prided himself on being a \u201cgarbage can of a choreographer\u201d, picking things up from India, Europe and elsewhere in Asia as well as from home. \u201cAnd we were isolated here and that was wonderful. In New York or London there are giants with long shadows. Here I just had to dig to find the things around me.\u201d Over the years he has instigated innovative forms of training and preparation for his dancers. Songs of the Wanderers, which was first performed 22 years ago, came out of a trip Lin took to Bodh Gaya in India, the place where the Buddha attained his enlightenment. Although Lin had been brought up as a Buddhist, the journey, and the realisation that Buddha \u201cwas not a god, he was a simple human being who had great compassion and that is why he figured out this philosophy about life\u201d, had a profound impact on Lin\u2019s life and work. He had already asked his dancers to work in rice fields to prepare for roles and now he suggested meditation. \u201cWe went on to use martial arts, and qigong, an ancient breathing exercise, in our daily training. At first the dancers hated it. They wanted to do pirouettes and jumps. But I asked them to just stand there and drop their eyes and eventually we came up with the work.\u201d     Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-min. Photograph: Alamy    The 24 dancers of the company have all come through the Taiwanese system that provides dance classes alongside regular schooling. \u201cFrom the very beginning we didn\u2019t want performances to be monopolised by the elite,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe great majority of our dancers are ordinary kids. Our performances \u2013 particularly the big outdoor performances around the country \u2013 are a gift and an endorsement and an expectation from the public. And the dancers are connected to the society because it is made up of their cousins and neighbours and parents, even when we are performing in the country to farmers and melon sellers.\u201d These outdoor performances have also had a wider impact on Taiwanese life. When there were mass political demonstrations the organisers drew on Cloud Gate\u2019s experience of stewarding, providing toilets and so on. \u201cAfter our performances there is never a scrap of litter left,\u201d says Lin. \u201cWhen there were political demonstrations it was the same.\u201d Public support for the company was also demonstrated when its studio and offices burned down in 2008. Without Cloud Gate having to launch a formal appeal, 4,500 private donors \u2013 there was no government money \u2013 contributed over $20m to build it a new home. \u201cThis is how we keep going,\u201d says Lin. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a big grants. It is a people\u2019s company and a people\u2019s theatre.\u201d The company is also democratic in its makeup, with dancers ranging in age from 22 to 52. The oldest member, Wang Wei-ming, originated one of the key roles in Songs of the Wanderers and, after leaving the company to teach at university, contacted Lin asking if he could dance the part again before the show itself is retired. \u201cI was very happy for him to do this, but I wanted him to show me that he was still capable and not kidding himself. So he gave us all a dry version and the other dancers just stood and applauded. At 52 he was dancing better than many of them. There was a real substance to the work.\u201d Lin sees those same qualities in dancers who have become mothers, and he encourages them to return to the stage. \u201cThey not only have such awareness of their bodies, motherhood itself gives them a perspective about life that comes through in their dance.\u201d     Songs of the Wanderers. Photograph: Yu Hui-hung    Another long standing \u2013 literally \u2013 member of the cast is Wang Rong-yu who originated the part of the Monk. \u201cHe had no dance background, but is a practitioner of qigong, and I saw him walk into a room and knew he could do it.\u201d His performance, standing nearly motionless for 70 minutes, is a remarkable display of strength, control and concentration. \u201cHe is also now into his 50s and that\u2019s partly why I have to wrap this up,\u201d says Lin. \u201cHe is so beautiful to look at, but I don\u2019t want to torture him any more, so the work will be performed for one more season in Taiwan and then retired.\u201d Lin says that he intends to retire too. \u201cThe company will go on, even if that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean with my own works. I wouldn\u2019t want it to become a museum. When we began we wanted to perform to, and connect with, the grassroots. Forty three years later we are still doing that, which makes me very happy. This building is the completion of the first stage of my retirement. It is a house to shelter younger artists who can carry on the work. The existence of the company is an accumulation of the energy from society. So long as we maintain that supply of energy, the torch will always continue to burn.\u201d \u2022 Cloud Gate will perform Songs of the Wanderers at Sadler\u2019s Wells, London EC1, 4-7 May (sadlerswells.com), then at the international dance festival, Birmingham, 10-11 May. idfb.co.uk.", "tags": ["Dance", "Stage", "Taiwan", "Culture", "Art and design"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-23T06:00:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/25/improving-with-age-how-city-design-is-adapting-to-older-populations", "sentences": ["There is a rise in assisted living schemes, like the US-designed Merrill Gardens in Shanghai and Harbin."], "title": "Improving with age? How city design is adapting to older populations", "article": "There is no denying it: like it or not we are all getting older. According to the UN World Population Prospects report, the global population of older people is growing at an unprecedented rate. By 2050, for the first time in human history, there will be more over-65s than children under 15. The number of people over 100 will increase by 1,000%. And as by then 70% of the world\u2019s population will likely live in cites, this will present huge challenges, and cities will need to adapt. Of course an ageing population is not inherently a bad thing: it reflects improved health and rising life expectancies. However, as we age, our housing, transport and social needs change. By preparing for this, policymakers, town planners and architects can make it more likely that older populations can still lead fulfilling lives. The global engineering firm Arup has looked at how authorities are responding to this demographic shift. Stefano Recalcati, project leader behind the firm\u2019s report Shaping Ageing Cities, explains that cities must adjust if older people are to maintain quality of life: \u201cIt\u2019s important to be conscious of the ageing trend. It is a huge challenge for world cities \u2013 they will need to change, to make sure older people continue to play an active role in the community and don\u2019t become isolated. Isolation has a negative impact on health so tackling that is really important.\u201d  \u201cSmall innovations can make a difference,\u201d Recalcati adds. \u201cOlder people are less likely to drive, favouring public transport and walking. The average person over 65 manages a walking speed of 3km/hour. At 80 that goes down to 2km/hour, compared with the average for a working age person of 4.8km/hour. Reducing the distance between transport stops, shops, benches, trees for shade, public toilets and improving pavements and allowing more time to cross the road all encourage older people to go out.\u201d In the UK, the government has just announced the building of 10 new towns designed to address ageing and health issues such as obesity. As well as encouraging more active lifestyles, the designs could include wider pavements, few trip hazards and moving LCD signs, making the streets easier to navigate for people with dementia and other age-related conditions. London-based charity Living Streets has also been working alongside communities carrying out street audits with older residents to see what improvements could be made, as well as campaigning at a strategic level to influence positive legislative and infrastructure changes. Their project Time to Cross campaigned to increase pedestrian crossing times which resulted in Transport for London (TfL) agreeing to a review.     \u2018Allowing more time to cross the road encourage older people to go out.\u2019 Photograph: Francisco Calvino/Moment Editorial/Getty Images    Cities that have addressed accessibility are likely to be ahead of the game in age-friendliness. In recent years there have been efforts to make cities more accessible to both disabled and elderly residents and visitors. Berlin is aiming for 100% accessibility by 2020. The city authorities are working to widen pavements, bring in tactile guidance at road crossings and easier access to trams and buses. This year Milan won the European Commission\u2019s Access City Award for its high standard of building design and access to transport. What lessons can urban planners learn from looking at existing retirement communities? These are popular in the US and growing in other parts of the world: separate towns, often gated, for over-55s. Deane Simpson, an architect who teaches at the Royal Danish Academy of Arts in Copenhagen, recently spoke at an event organised by Museum of Architecture and The Building Centre in London about designing cities for an ageing population. In his book Young-Old: Urban Utopias of an Ageing Society, Simpson looks at communities likefor 55-75 year olds who are retired and in good health with money to spend. One scheme The Villages in Florida, a network of \u201cvillage\u201d developments housing 115,000 over-55s linked by a 90-mile network of car-free golf-cart roadways \u2013 and offers a life of restaurants, bars, cinemas and sports.  Simpson is critical of the way this type of lifestyle cuts people off from the rest of society, with age becoming a new form of segregation. However he accepts that they reflect a desire for an active, experience-filled lifestyle. Simpson admits that there are certain elements that could be applied to a multigenerational urban setting: \u201cThe golf cart infrastructure provides a transport network for vehicles slower than cars. This could be replicated as a way of integrating mobility scooters and electric wheelchairs and bicycles. In Denmark and the Netherlands where biking culture is strong, bike lanes are increasingly being used by mobility scooters. It is a way of enabling safe mobility for those not able to walk and not able to drive.\u201d     Mobility utopia or exclusive haven? Golf carts are the main transportation at The Villages in Florida. Photograph: Alamy    The US model of retirement communities is increasingly being exported. In China more than a quarter of the population will be over 65 by 2050. The elderly have traditionally been taken care of by the extended family \u2013 often with three generations living together. But demographic changes are severely challenging that family unit. The one child policy combined with longer life expectancy means that a typical married couple could be looking after four parents and up to eight grandparents.  There is a rise in assisted living schemes, like the US-designed Merrill Gardens in Shanghai and Harbin. Lead 8 is an architecture and design studio working in the region; their co-founder and director Simon Blore explains that they have worked on new developments in China that are 80-100% geared towards elderly groups. \u201cWe attempt to maintain the scale of a typical Chinese village; all needs are met within a short walking distance (the elderly in China do not have cars, and may no longer even use bicycles). Overlaid on this is a system of \u2018local\u2019 health clinics, essential services, open spaces and leisure facilities, which is not so different from assisted living housing, but on a much larger scale.\u201d Blore has reservations about whether US-style senior living will be widely accepted: \u201cI think most people want to be part of regular society, part of the community, so that\u2019s probably a challenge internationally \u2013 trying to get that balance right \u2013 a place with a high level of care and a sense of community and a relationship with the wider society.\u201d Lead 8 is working on a Malaysian residential complex in Kelana Jaya, near Kuala Lumpur, that could offer a solution. \u201cOn each floor there are flats of different sizes next to each other, with a wall that can be taken down. An owner can buy two adjoining apartments - one large and one small. The family lives in the big one with grandparents next door, and they can either be separate or interconnect.\u201d Integration rather than segregation is advocated by London architect Stephen Witherford. His firm, Witherford, Watson, Mann, will be building a complex of 57 flats for over-75s in Bermondsey, London. The project is based on the traditional almshouse model of charitable housing for pensioners, but updated for the 21st century. \u201cTraditionally almshouses were set back behind a fence,\u201d explains Witherford, \u201cbut we wanted to create a version that would tackle the problem of isolation. It will have a lounge that opens directly on to the high street.\u201d There will be a cookery school, performance space, rooftop allotment and a workshop. Residents can hold craft fairs, cake sales and perform or watch plays. \u201cThe public can come in and get involved. Amenities are nearby and there is a bus stop outside for trips into town.\u201d     The inner courtyard of a complex of flats in south London, designed for over-75s. Composite: Witherford Watson Mann    Rethinking traditional designs is also a priority for Susanne Clase, an architect with White Arkitekter, who is designing flats for seniors in Gothenburg, Sweden, and including potential residents and home-care professionals in the decision-making. She explains the flats are designed to accommodate regular visits from professional carers who help with personal tasks: \u201cin our design the public and private spaces are reversed. The bedroom and bathroom are by the front door so the carer can access them. The living room and kitchen are at the back and are the resident\u2019s private space.\u201d Clase believes that designing with ageing in mind is good for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s important to help people live independently for as long as possible, and to design that in from the beginning rather than make adaptations later on. We already have a high level of accessibility in Sweden. You won\u2019t get a permit to build unless you can show that if the resident breaks a leg it won\u2019t be a problem. So we are already thinking ahead.\u201d While Europe may be looking to the future, in Japan the future has already arrived. The country has the oldest population in the world: 33% is over 60, 25% over 65, and 12.5% over 75. \u201cJapan is very aged so the government is prioritising making cites age-friendly,\u201d says Setsuko Saya, head of regional policy at the OECD-led research into ageing in cities. Toyama, where 26% of residents are over 65, has adopted the principle of a compact city \u2013 which promotes high density, public transport, walking and cycling. The aim is to avoid the urban sprawl that can be so isolating for those with limited mobility. Despite being on a large area of flat land, which could be developed, the policy is not to expand outwards. A tram circles the city and investment is focused along the tramline and in the city centre, where there are public spaces for people to get together. People live in limited residential areas close to services and with good public transport \u2013 so they don\u2019t need to drive. Saya points out that it\u2019s important not to characterise ageing as a problem, and to recognise that these strategies don\u2019t just help older people: \u201cThe tram connects people as well as transports them. It\u2019s good for everyone.\u201d   Related: 'Disney World' for retirees: inside America's fastest-growing community    While developing public transport is important, there will always be some unable to access it. A UK report by the International Longevity Centre found that despite transport being free for the over-65s, more than 30% of them don\u2019t use the service. In these cases, self-driving cars are put forward as a solution that could \u201cliberate\u201d older people, as a mobility service for those who can no longer drive and are not served by public transport. Google are even \u201ctargeting\u201d their self-driving cars to retirees. The city of Suzu in northern Japan has already been trialling the use of self-driving cars to keep older people mobile. But how will these innovations work in an age of austerity, reduced pensions, later retirement and rising housing costs? Age-friendly design can help us rethink our cities, but how can we make sure these innovations reach the majority of older people? Looking to the future, with millennials expected to be poorer than their baby-boomer parents, young people unable to get on the housing ladder today are unlikely to have equity in old age. Professor Christopher Phillipson of Manchester University believes more political will is needed to make sure age-friendly cities include those hit by austerity and industrial decline: \u201cage friendly cities cost money but in the UK there is less money available for local authorities wanting to take action. There are considerable barriers \u2013 given pressures on budgets and limited commitment from policy-makers and developers. In the absence of these the possibility of creating age-friendly environments will be constrained.\u201d In Manchester, the first UK city to be recognised as age-friendly by the World Health Organisation, the Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing (Micra) has been training older people to research what makes an age-friendly city. They found that for most people it was human contact, rather than high-tech gizmos that were important \u2013 such as door-to-door community visits for people unable to use public transport. \u201cManchester is age-friendly because it has strong political leadership and the city supports neighbourhood groups, and works with community leaders,\u201d continues Professor Phillipson. \u201cThe most important thing is collaboration across a broad range of interests, not least older people themselves.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "tags": ["Cities", "Design", "Architecture", "Housing", "Society", "Older people", "Communities"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-25T09:11:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/25/10-best-hostels-lodges-b-and-b-hiking-walking-us-italy--china", "sentences": ["Huangshan Airport receives domestic flights from most major Chinese cities, while its train station has daily trains arriving from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Nanjing.\u2022 Rooms from \u00a350; +86 559 558 2288."], "title": "10 of the best hostels and lodges \u2026 that you have to hike to", "article": "The Dolomites, Italy Rifugio LagazuoiRifugio Lagazuoi is like a sentinel 2,750m above the spires and green valleys of northern Italy, offering not only panoramic views from its sprawling terrace but also the highest sauna in the Dolomites.

Open year-round; minimum 45min trekking time The Highlands, Scotland      Glen Affric Youth HostelThis hostel is probably the closest you\u2019ll get to an alpine hut in Scotland. A former bothy at the doorstep of 15 munros, it\u2019s a haven for solitude-seekers, with no phone signal and ample opportunities to escape in forest, loch and glen scenery. The eco-friendly outpost harnesses wind and solar energy for electricity, while a wood-burning stove provides heating and hot water for showers. There\u2019s also a live-in host who welcomes arriving guests with tea and helps curate a singular stay in the Highlands.Getting hereIt\u2019s a long and winding 13km from the nearest road to reach the Glen Affric Youth Hostel. But with an elevation change of just 250m, the journey is suitable for most active travellers. Access to the trailhead at Glen Affric car park is available by bus from Inverness three times a week in the summer months (July-Sept).\u2022 Rooms from \u00a356, bunks from \u00a323, syha.org.uk.

High up in its enchanting forests, above the turquoise waters of Lake Louise, you\u2019ll find a veritable castle in the sky in Skoki Lodge. This rustic-chic alpine retreat is at its best in the summer months when alpine wildflowers paint nearby meadows plum purple and fire red. Yet, Skoki is equally enjoyable in the colder months when access is only available by ski or snowshoe.Getting hereA moderate 11km path through a verdant alpine terrain separates Skoki Lodge from the village of Lake Louise. Check in at the Experience Lake Louise shop for a transfer to the trailhead near Temple Lodge. Access to Lake Louise is possible from the airport in Calgary (185km away) aboard the two shuttle bus services that ply this route year-round.\u2022 Rooms from \u00a3123, skoki.com.

It\u2019s only accessible by foot (or mountain bike) and has a beachfront location with kayaks ready and waiting for adventures to nearby coves. The property\u2019s hammocks are an antidote for sore feet and a great option for lazing away an afternoon with a glass of local sauvignon blanc in hand.Getting hereMahana Lodge is on the 70km Queen Charlotte Track, an inn-to-inn \u201ctramping\u201d route that skirts the coast of Queen Charlotte Sound from the historic town of Ship Cove to the resort village of Anakiwa. Access to Ship Cove is by a one-hour water taxi journey from the city of Picton. From there it\u2019s a 27km trek to Mahana, which can be done in one day for the very fit or split in two for the average walker (with a stop on day one at an inn or campground at the head of Endeavour Inlet).\u2022 Rooms from \u00a3100, mahanalodge.co.nz. Open Oct-April; 8 hours trekking time The Grand Canyon, US      Phantom RanchThere is only one lodging facility at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and it\u2019s so popular that it can often be booked up more than a year in advance (note: new reservations become available 13 months out). The Phantom Ranch is a Historic Hotel of America with a nearly 100-year history welcoming visitors into the bowels of the wild west\u2019s most iconic landmark. Built of rough-hewn wood and native stone, the ranch\u2019s rustic cabins blend into the natural surroundings along the north side of the Colorado river near its confluence with Bright Angel and Phantom creeks.Getting hereThere are two approaches to Phantom Ranch. The 12km South Kaibab Trail is shorter but lacks sun-shelters and drinking water. The 16.5km Bright Angel Trail, meanwhile, is longer but safer with more facilities. You can get to Grand Canyon national park by bus from nearby cities such as Flagstaff, Phoenix or Las Vegas and use the park\u2019s free shuttle bus system to reach either trailhead, as needed. \u2022 Cabins from $142, dorms from $49, grandcanyonlodges.com.

Some of the lakes now fill with runoff directly from the Stirling Range; others are controlled primarily by groundwater. Many of the saltwater lakes in this region are short-lived. Still, a range of salt-loving aquatic invertebrates, such as brine shrimp, have adapted to the tough conditions.

How fracking has changed the landscape Credits: OLI/Landsat 5and Landsat 8/Nasa   In the early 2000s, the area east of Cotulla, Texas, was dry, sleepy shrubland. By 2015, a bustling network of roads and rectangular drill pads had completely transformed the landscape. The pair of satellite images below shows how much the landscape has changed - the \u201cbefore\u201d image was captured in December 2000; the \u201cafter\u201d image in December 2015. According to a report from the Texas Observer, Cotulla saw its population swell from about 4,000 to 10,000 people in just a few years due to an influx of oil and gas workers for \u201cfracking\u201d.      Credits: VIIRS/Suomi NPP/NASA Photograph: VIIRS/Suomi NPP/NASA     In nighttime satellite imagery, the light from the Eagle Ford shale formation competes with the nearby cities of San Antonio and Austin. The electric glow of drilling equipment, worker camps, and other gas and oil infrastructure combine with flickering gas flares to create an unmistakable arc of light across southern Texas.         The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder aboard Nasa\u2019s Aqua satellite shows global methane concentrations in January 2016 at a pressure of 400 hectopascals, or roughly 6km above the surface.  Methane is a chemical compound that shows up nearly everywhere on the planet. It bubbles up from swamps and rivers, belches from volcanoes, rises from wildfires, and seeps from the guts of cows and termites. Human settlements are awash with the gas. Methane leaks silently from natural gas and oil wells and pipelines, as well as coal mines. It stews in landfills, sewage treatment plants, and rice paddies.  It is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, and yet the reasons for why and where it shows up are often a mystery. What science shows is that a lot more methane has made its way into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Less understood is why the ebb and flow of this gas has changed in recent decades.   Since 2007, methane has been on the rise, and no one is quite sure why. Some scientists think tropical wetlands have gotten a bit wetter and are releasing more gas. Others point to the natural gas fracking boom in North America and its sometimes leaky infrastructure. Others wonder if changes in agriculture may be playing a role.      Credits: MODIS/Terra/NASA    A river of dust flows from the Saharan desert across the Mediterranean Sea behind a strong cold front. A line of heavy cloud marks the leading edge of the cold front as it marches from east to west. The landscape ahead of the front appears crisply defined while cloud and dust obscure most of the land and water from view behind the leading edge. This cold front was part of a cyclonic system named Golia that created severe weather across the region.  Italy was hit especially hard, with heavy rain, high wind gusts, and storm surges battering the southern part of the country while snowstorms hit the north. Five people were reported killed in Italy from extreme weather caused by Golia.  As the cold front moved across the Mediterranean, sand and dust from as far south as the Sahara desert rode moved behind the front. It is not uncommon for strong southerly winds to carry dust from Africa across the Mediterranean. The dramatic spectacle of a massive movement of Saharan dust behind a crisp cold front is more rarely captured from space.

It is not often that the northern lights are visible south of Scotland and Northern Ireland, but a geomagnetic storm coloured night skies over a much wider swath of the country.  The brilliant colours of the aurora are provoked by activity the sun: solar energy and particles speed toward Earth in a steady stream called the solar wind, or they rush out in massive eruptions known as coronal mass ejections. These storms disturb geospace (the space around Earth) and energise particles already trapped in the magentosphere and radiation belts. Electrons then race down Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines and crash into the gases at high altitudes of the atmosphere. Oxygen gives off a green colour when excited; nitrogen produces blue or red colours.   Satellite image of central Iran Credits: OLI/Landsat 8/NASA   Vivid colours and an extraordinary range of shapes and patterns fill this satellite image of central Iran. The colours have an otherworldly look for good reason. In contrast to the natural-colour Landsat images, this is a false-colour image composed from light that is invisible to human eyes.  False-colour satellite images often have a vibrant and otherworldly look. Though they can be quite beautiful and even seem artistic, a carefully interpreted false-colour image can provide remarkable scientific insights as well.  Comparing these false and natural-colour versions of this image of the Yazd and South Khorosan provinces of Iran, it is much easier to make out the boundaries between different rock layers and formations in false colour. It is also possible to see where water flows down from the dark ridges on the western edge of the false-colour image. The streaks of green throughout the false-colour image are not representative of vegetation, but rather show the distribution of rock with a particular composition.     Credits: MODIS/Terra/NASA    Late winter storms dumped a fresh coating of snow across the Alps in mid-March 2016. The fresh powder was a welcome sight for skiers, snowboarders and the many resorts that cater to them.    Across the Alps, snow cover was late to arrive in the winter of 2015-16. Some early November snowfall - the usual start of the season - was followed by weeks of above-average temperatures. Many locations did not see substantial snow until after New Year\u2019s day. Weather patterns grew more seasonable in January and February, and a heavy March snowfall \u2014 40-100cm in some areas \u2014 gave hope to the winter sports industry. This season, as well as 2014-15, fit with the long-term trend in the European Alps. For much of the 20th century, snow cover increased slightly or held steady. But in the 1980s and 90s, average winter snow cover started to decrease, and winter rainfall increased at lower altitudes. That trend has continued in the 21st century. Though the average area covered by snow in any given winter has not changed much, the depth and the duration of snow cover has decreased, particularly in the south-eastern and south-western mountains and in areas below 2,000m altitude.     Credits:ISS/NASA    The image shows angular gashes in the snow-covered landscape of north-eastern Wyoming. The astronaut\u2019s eye was drawn to the open-cast pits of several coal mines that operate out of the small town of Gillette, which appears on the lower right. The coal lies at very shallow depth, making it economical to mine. The steep walls of the overlying rocks cast strong shadows in this snowy scene. Wind distributes coal dust so that the pits appear much darker, especially the largest pit in the view (upper left).    The port city of Haifa on Israel\u2019s Mediterranean coast Credits: ISS/NASA   The same astronaut probably took both of these photographs of the port city of Haifa on Israel\u2019s Mediterranean coast. In geography training, astronauts are taught to concentrate on the shapes of coastlines because they are a first-order visual cue when circling the planet, and often uniquely shaped. The nose of Cape Karmel and the bay that protects the Port of Haifa are shapes that can tell crews where they are. In the daylight image, the strong visual line of the coast contrasts with the subtle city colours. The steep slope of the north flank of Mount Carmel (bottom of the image), facing the port, is marked by a long, dark shadow in the mid-afternoon sunlight. Older neighbourhoods with linear roads lie on the lower slopes, closer to the port. Newer neighbourhoods show a pattern of streets that wind along the intricate edges of the canyons. In a small country where land is scarce, brown farmlands appear close to the middle of the city. The night shot does not show the coastline, but it does show different city neighbourhoods in a way that is difficult to see in the day. The brilliant port lights contrast with somewhat dimmer residential areas. Straight roads of the older residential neighbourhoods are easily distinguished from the winding roads that follow the canyon cliffs. The industrial area just east of the port has areas of green and blue lights and a less dense street pattern. Surrounding farmlands are so dark that they can be confused with the sea.

Notice the thick cloud of smoke that obscures much of western Thailand and eastern Myanmar.  Fire has a long history as a land management tool in south-east Asia; most of the fires detected by the satellite were likely lit intentionally. In cultivated lowlands (tan area), farmers use fire to burn crop debris after harvest and to prepare the land for the growing season. In the mountains (green), some people practice \u201cslash and burn\u201d to clear forested areas with fire, planting crops for a few years, and then letting brush and forest retake the fields during a fallow period intended to replenish soil nutrients. Fires are also sometimes lit to promote the growth of grasses used to make thatch roofs and brooms, to encourage the reproduction of certain mushrooms, to make seeds of some wild plant seeds germinate, and to flush out game during hunts for wildlife. Though many of the fires were surely lit intentionally, natural conditions are potentially intensifying them and causing some to burn out of control. South-east Asia is in the midst of a drought that has parched forests and other vegetation. Observers in Vietnam are calling the drought there the worst in 90 years. The lack of rain has led to intrusions of salt water into rice paddies and other croplands along the Mekong delta. In Thailand, authorities have diverted water from the Mekong river to agricultural areas in response to the dry weather, a move that has worried neighbouring countries. In an attempt to ease tensions, China announced in March that it would release extra water into the Mekong at the Jinghong hydropower station.   The impact of sand mining on the northern reaches of Poyang Lake Credits: Landsat 5 and OLI/Landsat 8/NASA    Over the past few decades, the global demand for construction sand has boomed, especially in Asia due to rapid urbanisation. In China alone, the demand for cement has increased 438% over the past two decades. In 2000, dredging and other sand mining become so intensive along the Yangtze river that Chinese authorities banned the activity along the lower and middle reaches of the river. This drove many sand mining operators to Poyang Lake, a large body of water that flows into the Yangtze about 600km upstream of Shanghai. This pair of false-colour images shows the impact of sand mining on the northern reaches of the lake. The first image was acquired in December 1995; the second image shows the same area in December 2013.  By contrasting the two images, we can see dramatic changes in the outlet channel that connects Poyang Lake to the Yangtze river. Sand removal and dredging have deepened and widened the channel significantly. These activities also have left the remaining sandbars and shores with an irregular, serrated appearance.  Using infrared dat, researchers found that the lake was producing up to 236 million cubic metres of sand per year \u2014 about 9% of the total produced by China - enough to make Poyang Lake the largest sand-mining operation in the world. Field research on wintering waterbirds the lake found that it hosted 98% of endangered Siberian cranes and oriental white storks, as well as a significant number of other endangered waterbirds.

A floating shelf of ice attached to the coast of Antarctica appears ready to shed an iceberg into the Southern Ocean Credits: OLI/Landsat 8/NASA   A floating shelf of ice attached to the coast of Antarctica appears ready to shed an iceberg into the Southern Ocean. Over the course of two years, a small crack grew large enough to spread across nearly the entire width of the Nansen Ice Shelf. The first image was acquired in December 2013 and second in December 2015. These floating shelves are important for holding back the flow of ice from the interior of the continent to the sea. Ice that sloughs from a floating shelf does not raise sea level. But lose part of the ice shelf, and the seaward flow of land ice can accelerate \u2014 a phenomenon that contributes to sea-level rise.      On a map created in 1590, the area was labeled Promontorium tremendum: horrible headland, or cape terrible. Four centuries later, these barrier islands along the North Carolina coast are better known as havens for turtles and wild horses and for humans seeking a bit of tranquility by the sea.  This image of Cape Lookout national park shows swirling sediments and shallow bottoms as faint green, tan, and blue areas around the islands.

The Great Salt Lake, partly visible on the left side of the image, is the largest salt-water lake in the western hemisphere.  The lighter blue areas denote solar evaporation ponds at the edges of the lake, which produce salts and brine. The lake contributes an estimated $1.3bn annually to Utah\u2019s economy, comprising the harvesting of brine shrimp, industry in mineral extraction, and recreation. Although it has been referred to as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dead Sea\u201d, the lake provides habitat for millions of native birds, brine shrimp, shorebirds and waterfowl. In 1904, the Southern Pacific Causeway was built to create a shorter route across the lake, visible across the top part.

Several other smaller lakes also appear in this image. It has been estimated that Africa holds about 30,000 cubic kilometers (7,197 cubic miles) of water in large lakes. This is the largest volume of water in large lakes of any continent. Lakes are an integral and important part of human lives, serving as a source of livelihoods, recreation, and nourishment, as well as critical sources of drinking water. Lakes can also be risk factors, especially to those living near them, as they can be major sources of natural disasters (such as floods) as well as hosts to diseases and pollutants. As populations increase, more stress is putting on the natural ecosystem of a lake, often decreasing the ability of people to safely use the water or decreasing fisheries. Climate change can also dramatically damage a lake\u2019s ecosystem, such as the dramatic drying of Lake Chad, which has lost about 90% of its former size.

Trying to be polite, I pegged him at 64. \u201cI\u2019m 82\u201d, he grinned. Such an admission wouldn\u2019t usually inspire confidence in a passenger. But in Tokyo, where almost a quarter of the population are over 65, working so late in life isn\u2019t just a personal triumph; it\u2019s fast becoming a social necessity.  Japan, which has the highest proportion of people over 65 in the world, is ahead of other countries in embracing ageing as an urban phenomenon. Its capital city is a good example of an appropriate urban environment for older people: for one, you\u2019ll rarely find steps in public buildings or train stations in Tokyo without an accompanying ramp or lift. Everything from the traffic lights to elevators to the ATMs talks at you, often in a squeaky voice. This isn\u2019t a cutesy Japanese foible, as many foreign visitors assume \u2013 it\u2019s to ensure that signals and instructions are also communicated to people with poor eyesight. Cities have traditionally run on young blood, defined by energy, innovation and change, while getting older has been associated with embracing a quieter life in the suburbs or rural areas. And yet, as a result of the economic development and advances in healthcare in the 20th century, the world is both urbanising and ageing. These twin challenges are converging to create a new phenomenon: silver cities.    You\u2019ll rarely find steps in public buildings or train stations in Tokyo without an accompanying ramp or lift    By 2020, the global population of people aged 60 and over will outnumber children younger than five years for the first time. The World Health Organisation estimates that by 2050, there will be 2 billion people aged 60 years and older, up from 841 million today.  Older populations are expanding faster in cities than in non-metropolitan areas in OECD countries. In Lisbon, Milan, Barcelona and Tokyo, nearly a quarter of the population are already over 65. Contrary to popular assumptions, it\u2019s not just a problem for Japan and Europe: by 2050, the population aged 65 and over in developing countries is expected to more than triple, outpacing the global growth rate. According to the WHO, 80% of people over 60 will be living in developing countries within five decades.     In Barcelona, nearly a quarter of the population are already over 65. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    The ageing of the global population is something to celebrate, as it reflects the improved living standards that have raised average life expectancy from 47 in the 1950s to around 70 today. At the same time, birth rates have fallen, resulting in a higher proportion of older people. In most countries, mortality fell before fertility did, creating a so-called \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation that was followed by generations of fewer and fewer children. In cities with slow growth this effect is acute: in Tokyo, Milan, and Barcelona, the over-65s outnumber the under-14s by a factor of around two to one. These cities could be said to be the most elderly in the world.  By comparison, cities such as Shanghai, Seoul and Moscow may be relatively young, but their older populations are growing fast. In London \u2013 where 32% of the population is under 25 \u2013 the number of people over 60 is projected to expand by 48% by 2035, while the population of the under 60s will only increase by 12%, according to a report by the mayor\u2019s Design Advisory Group. A third category of cities still have a majority of young people and are ageing at a slower pace, although they will face similar demographic shifts in the future. Johannesburg, where 41% of people are under 25 and only 4% are over 65, is one of these. How does a city effectively support healthy ageing while remaining a vital centre of culture, commerce and innovation? The WHO defines an \u201cage-friendly\u201d city as one which ensures quality of life for people as they age by optimising opportunities for health, participation in society, and security. By improving access to both urban infrastructure and society, cities can ensure people remain active in work, family and civic life as they age, reaping the benefits of their experience and knowledge. Ageing societies also present opportunities for innovation \u2013 and therefore growth.     The number of people over 60 in London is projected to expand by 48% by 2035. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    However, ageing cities do face a challenge. They will need to balance a shrinking labour supply with increased costs for health and social care. In Calgary, where only 2% of older people participate in the labour force, a programme was established to hire retired city employees for limited-term projects that require particular skills. To respond to increasing care needs and to allow people to stay in their homes for as long as possible, Helsinki has launched a pilot programme to provide customised home services from public, private and voluntary associations that are in line with people\u2019s personal budgets.  Cities will also have to deal with an increase in people suffering complex physical and mental health issues due to ageing. In Japan, dementia-related railway accidents are on the increase, which led convenience stores in Osaka to pledge they would be \u201cdementia supporters\u201d by training staff to assist older people who appear disorientated.  Balancing the desires of different generations can be difficult: last year, Tokyo changed a law to stop children\u2019s voices being considered noise pollution, after multiple complaints from elderly residents living near schools were upheld, preventing the construction of new nurseries in a city that suffers from a dire shortage of childcare facilities.  Older people \u2013 defined as those over 65 for the purposes of this article \u2013 are not a homogenous group, however, as Florian Kohlbacher, founding director of the Research Institute on Ageing and Society at Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University explains. People\u2019s lifestyles, physical and mental capacities and personal preferences become more diverse as they age. That means that while some need round-the-clock care, many others are running businesses, or marathons. Fighting ageism \u2013 and the image of older people as physically or mentally impaired , or even \u201cuseless\u201d \u2013 is one of the major challenges in developing a city in which older people can live life to the fullest and in which their accumulated skills and wisdom are properly harnessed.

Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images    That said, there is a higher statistical incidence of disability and illness in older people, and most of us become physically weaker as we age. Since lack of exercise can accelerate physical decline and lead to osteoporosis, obesity and other health problems, cities should encourage walking and cycling to prevent age-related declines in strength and fitness, according to an OECD report. To that end, Yokohama, a city near Tokyo, has introduced a walking programme that offers free pedometers to people over 40 and awards points for steps walked. 152,670 people have signed up so far; 92,168 of the participants are over 65. Since close proximity to shops and parks is associated with higher mobility, compact cities with public transport networks may be healthier environments to age in than rural locations, where a car is needed to get around. In one study in Portland, housing density was associated with greater levels of walking while another in Bogota found that having pedestrianised corridors at the weekend was correlated with more walking among older residents. But the downside of urban living can be a lack of personal contact. Isolation is a big problem for older people, who often become \u201cinvisible\u201d in cities. Some are too frail or physically incapacitated to make their way around the city; others lack incentives, the financial capacity or access to social events. Many also live alone. As the WHO notes, older people tend to prefer human contact to automated systems, and so a \u201csmart city\u201d in which the main interface is a touch-screen rather than a human face may be detrimental for older people\u2019s mental health.    Related: \u2018My neighbour avoids me ... I was very unhappy\u2019: your tales of urban loneliness    However, there are some ways in which technology can be leveraged to lessen isolation. Be\u015fikta\u015f, a city in Turkey with double the proportion of over-65s as the rest of the country, launched a \u201cwellness service\u201d in 2013 that provides senior citizens with a device through which they can order services such as meals or a haircut, phone friends and family, or even call an ambulance, at the push of a button. Work is one way to tackle isolation. The mayor\u2019s design advisory group in London recently released a report advocating for the creation of an \u201cintergenerational start-up culture\u201d that would connect experienced older people with younger entrepreneurs. The report also acknowledged that many older people have the potential to become entrepreneurs themselves. Lisbon has started a Senior University, open to anyone over the age of 50, where senior volunteers offer lectures on the arts or computer sciences, while the Technical University of Lisbon (UTL) provides classes for over 50s that lead to a degree in science, technology or citizenship. A new partnership in Manchester between Centre for Ageing Better and Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) aims to develop and share innovative approaches to tackling social, economic and health inequalities in later life, including supporting people aged 50 years and over re-enter the labour market. Due to a low birth rate and the lack of mass immigration in Japan, it is estimated that by 2022 there will only be two people of working age for every person over 65. However, it also has one of the highest labour participation rates in older people in the developed world, with 29.3% of men over 65 employed, versus 8.2% in Germany and 3.2% in France. Some work out of financial necessity, but many accept such jobs because work in Japanese culture is tightly correlated to personal self-esteem and ikigai, or purpose in life. That reality is evident on the streets of Tokyo, and not just with octagenarian taxi drivers. Many retired men find work painting fences, managing bicycle parks, or even on roadworks, where they are usually charged with waving a luminous stick to alert pedestrians and cyclists to the existence of a hole in the pavement. Whether they\u2019re working or not, older people are going to be an increasingly common presence in our cities in years to come. What we can hope is that our cities\u2019 old age is, much like our own, not as bad as our younger selves feared; and that, with support from both the state and society, our cities will turn more silver than grey.

This made sense, as it had been his scent that first attracted me several weeks earlier. I\u2019d chosen him as one of my Smell Dating matches, an online matchmaking project that combines the internet\u2019s ability to judge multiple people at once with a physical object (a smelly T-shirt) packed full of pheromones. Billed as \u201cthe first mail odor dating service\u201d, Smell Dating hopes to connect people based on what body odor they find attractive. For $25, you\u2019re sent a T-shirt to wear for three days \u2013 no perfume or deodorant allowed. You then send it off and receive samples to sniff in exchange. You choose which scent you like the best, and if both your nostrils agree the other smells great, you\u2019ll be matched via email. No information about age, gender or sexual orientation is known beforehand.       \u201cGenerally the people who smell better to you are genetically different to you,\u201d explained Tega Brain, a 33-year-old artist from Brooklyn who created the project with New York University researcher Sam Lavigne. Research on pheromones is still ongoing, but Brain explains that our interest in someone else\u2019s smell is based on the compatibility of your immune systems (sexy!). \u201cWe sort of joke, maybe high contemporary divorce rates are due to deodorant and not being in tune to smell,\u201d she added. For three days I wore the same white V-neck T-shirt both day and night in an effort to \u201cembrace the musky possibilities\u201d, as Smell Dating encourages. Luckily it was a relatively cool weekend and I deliberately avoided exercise, but I was working on a big story and anxiously sweated over it (and then worried how that would affect my scent). By the end of the weekend, my T-shirt had a definite pong to it. I wrapped it up in its bag and shipped it off. A week later, I received 10 different bits of T-shirt to sniff. The samples all come from the armpit region. Brain called it the \u201cmost data-rich\u201d area.       Some smelled so strongly of rancid body odor that I gagged. Another smelled like bubblegum. One had the fragrance of laundry mixed with sweat; another like they\u2019d just gone on a hike outdoors. \u201cOne of the things about smell, it was so clear to me who I liked and didn\u2019t \u2026 it releases you from having to do that [normal internet dating] analysis,\u201d said Brain. After my scent experience, I filled out the online form with my top picks and awaited my results. I got four matches: with a German artist, a sex columnist, an artist who once did an exhibit with human breast milk cheese and an origami artist. Two men, two women. Interestingly, I found that I matched with those I\u2019d ranked as \u201cmaybe\u201d rather than a definite \u201cyes\u201d.     Amber Jamieson meets her smell date, German artist Hannes.

He showed me a virtual reality meditation app he\u2019d created. He wasn\u2019t a match for me personally \u2013 although I did think he was handsome and smelled good, so the initial physical reaction was accurate \u2013 but I\u2019ve just done an email introduction with another friend of mine who I think he\u2019d get along great with. \u201cSmell dating is fully supportive of secondary matchmaking,\u201d laughed Brain, when I told her about my date.

On the anniversary of the execution of Chan and Sukumaran over a thwarted plan to smuggle heroin out of Bali, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not respond when asked how many Australians in jail could face capital punishment. It is understood there has been no change to the number Dfat confirmed last year, with groups including the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties not aware of any new cases.   Related: A year after the Bali Nine executions, Indonesia prepares firing squads again    But, in the past year, the prospect of execution drew closer for a former Adelaide jockey given a suspended death sentence in China for smuggling ice. And a verdict on another ice smuggling case in China, which will decide the fate of a young dual Australian and New Zealand citizen, could be just days away. The two men are among as many as 11 Australians thought to be held over drug prosecutions in a single southern Chinese city, Guangzhou. The possibility of execution by lethal injection or firing squad looms for all of them.  In Malaysia, an Australian woman could be hanged if found guilty of drug smuggling. In Vietnam, a Sydney man faces the prospect of secret execution by lethal injection of locally manufactured chemicals of \u201cunknown efficacy\u201d, according to Amnesty International. While the number of Australians on or facing death row held steady, the level of involvement by the Australian federal police in transnational investigations that could result in death penalties declined \u2013 but was still significant. Figures provided to Guardian Australia show the AFP provided information for investigations known as \u201cpotential death penalty situations\u201d 74 times in the past year. This was down from 100 times in 2014 and 89 times in 2012 but more than the 50 times in 2013. Of those 74 information exchanges in 2015, 11 of them were with the approval of Michael Keenan, the minister for justice, as required in cases where suspects are already charged or convicted. It is not known how many of these related to Australian citizens.    We need to keep talking about this issue so we can abolish the death penalty for good.  Michael Chan, brother of Andrew Chan     Guardian Australia was told that information provided by the AFP could include criminal history or lack thereof in Australia, which may be used by the accused to bolster their defences. The AFP has faced prolonged criticism for its role in tipping off Indonesian authorities about the plot of the \u201cBali Nine\u201d, which led to Chan and Sukumaran\u2019s executions. A Guangzhou customs official in 2014 cited growing cooperation with the AFP in recent years after a surge in drug arrests in the city involving Australians. In China, possession of more than 100g of an illicit drug automatically results in a trafficking charge and a possible death sentence. Andrew Chan\u2019s brother Michael recently told Reprieve Australia that while the anniversary of his death was \u201ca rollercoaster ride for the family to come to terms with the loss\u201d, it was important to maintain public discussion of capital punishment. \u201cCountries need to look at ways to rehabilitate prisoners instead of executing them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to keep talking about this issue so we can abolish the death penalty for good. \u201cI know this was what Andrew wanted and also need to speak up for the rest of the people that are on death row so they can be heard.\u201d Chan\u2019s widow, Febyanti Herewila, said his legacy was a renewed push for the death penalty to be abolished and the principle of \u201ca second chance\u201d. \u201cAlso Andrew wants the young people from around the world to learn from his life,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever decisions you make today it will determine your future.\u201d Countries that apply the death penalty on those convicted of using, dealing or trafficking drugs include Indonesia, Thailand, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. Anthony Roger Bannister, 43 (China) Australian jockey Bannister was handed a suspended death sentence last June after his March 2014 arrest for drug smuggling in Guangzhou. More than 3kg of crystal methamphetamine was found in envelopes stuffed into eight handbags in his luggage. Bannister claimed to have been set up after being promised a lucrative divorce settlement. Bannister, whose death sentence could be commuted to life in prison after two years of good behaviour, vowed to appeal the ruling, Fairfax Media reported.

Febyanti Herewila, Andrew Chan's widow     Her lawyer, Tania Scivetti, told Guardian Australia her case was fixed for hearing from 20 June to 24 June. Malaysian law carries a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. Three Australian nationals have been executed by the state: Michael McAuliffe in 1993, and Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in 1986. Bengali Sherrif and Ibrahim Jalloh (China) Sherrif and Jalloh were arrested by Chinese authorities at Guangzhou airport in June 2014. Sherrif was sentenced last April to a suspended death penalty for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine to Australia. Like Bannister\u2019s, Sherrif\u2019s sentence could also be commuted to life in prison after two years of good behaviour.  Jalloh went on trial last July, his lawyers arguing he had an intellectual disability that allowed him to be duped into acting as a drug mule. Prosecutors argued he was fit to stand trial as a Chinese psychiatrist found he had only \u201cslight mental development delay\u201d, Fairfax reported. The progress of his case is not known.  Pham Trung Dung, 37 (Vietnam) Dung was sentenced to death in June 2014 after being discovered with more than 4kg of heroin as he boarded a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia in May 2013. Dfat said at the time: \u201cWe understand that he has the right of appeal. Whether he decides to do so is a matter for the man and his lawyers.\u201d It is not known whether Dung appealed.  Amnesty International has raised concerns about the secrecy of Vietnam\u2019s executions and its use of domestically produced chemicals for lethal injection.

Campaigners attacked the move as the latest phase of President Xi Jinping\u2019s bid to rein in opposition to the Communist party. They said it represented a severe blow to non-profit groups involved in issues such as the environment, public health and education, as well as human rights. Lu Jun, a well-known social activist who was forced to move to the US last year after his organisation was targeted by law enforcement, described the decision to give greater powers to police as a disaster. \u201cThe real purpose of the foreign NGO law is to restrict foreign NGOs\u2019 activities in China and to restrict domestic-rights NGOs\u2019 activities in China by cutting the connection between [the two],\u201d he said. Lu, whose group, Yirenping, has campaigned on health and employment issues, claimed Beijing was attempting to use the new legislation to neutralise foreign-supported groups that it suspected were attempting to destabilise the government. \u201cThey consider foreign NGOs and some domestic NGOs as a threat to their regime,\u201d he said.   Related: China steps up human rights crackdown with arrest of foreign activist    Members of China\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People\u2019s Congress, green-lit the long-awaited law on Thursday afternoon, according to Xinhua, the country\u2019s official news agency. The foreign NGO \u201cmanagement\u201d law, which will come into effect on 1 January 2017, stipulates that any group wishing to operate in China must register with public security officials. Foreign NGOs must refrain from engaging in political or religious activities or acting in a way that damages \u201cChina\u2019s national interests\u201d or \u201cethnic unity\u201d, according to a 15-page outline of the law distributed to the media.  Criminal measures will be taken against any individual who is directly responsible for a foreign NGO found to have engaged in activities that \u201csplit the country or damage national unity or subvert the state\u201d.  The law also gives authorities the power to ban any NGO found to have \u201cviolated Chinese regulations\u201d from operating in China for five years. Foreign NGOs in China will only be permitted to use bank accounts registered with public security officials. \u201cThe authorities, particularly the police, will have virtually unchecked powers to target NGOs, restrict their activities, and ultimately stifle civil society,\u201d said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. \u201cThe law presents a very real threat to the legitimate work of independent NGOs and should be immediately revoked.\u201d Chinese officials have defended the need for such a law, arguing that it is an important step in improving the management of an estimated 7,000 foreign non-governmental operations operating in China. Until now NGOs have operated in a legal grey area in China with no specific law setting out how they can work. \u201cSince their number has grown quickly and their activities have intensified, it is necessary to have a law to regulate and guide them,\u201d Xu Xianming, a senior legal official, told Chinese state media on Tuesday. However, critics claim the law is a pretext to expanding the clampdown on Chinese civil society that many observers say is the most severe since the days following the 1989 military offensive against Tiananmen protesters. \u201cCivil society groups have been one of the only human rights success stories in recent years, and their survival is crucial for the country\u2019s future,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. \u201cBut the government seems incapable of tolerating independent, peaceful work and advocacy, and with this law it\u2019s making clear that only state-sanctioned work will be tolerated.\u201d     Volunteers of the Shanghai Roots and Shoots NGO dig holes to plant tree saplings in Kunlun Qi, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China.

With its \u201cvery hostile\u201d new law, Beijing was indicating it would now treat foreign NGOs as enemies rather than friends. \u201cI assume many foreign NGOs will withdraw their offices from China and will cancel their grants in China. And it will affect many, many domestic NGOs\u2019 budgets because it is very hard for NGOs to raise funds inside China because the government has set up many, many restrictions on funding raising for domestic NGOs.\u201d \u201cAlmost all kinds of service and charity NGOs will be confronting very big difficulties,\u201d Lu added. \u201cThere are so many restrictions \u2013 many, many obstacles.\u201d Critics of the legislation believe it was born out of Beijing\u2019s fears that foreign governments were using NGOs to undermine the Communist party by spreading western concepts such as democracy and freedom of speech. However, Lu predicted the law would cause most damage to groups involved in social issues such as HIV and Aids, poverty relief and education. China has been engaged in a widening campaign against civil society since Xi came to power in late 2012, detaining and jailing activists, journalists, and human rights lawyers. In January Peter Dahlin, a Beijing-based Swedish human rights campaigner, was taken into secret detention and accused of being an agent working for \u201cwestern anti-China forces\u201d to stir up opposition to the Communist party. Dahlin was subsequently removed from China after being paraded on state television to make what supporters called a \u201cforced confession\u201d.   Related: China targets lawyers in new human rights crackdown    Since last July, security services have been pursuing a major crackdown on Chinese human rights lawyers, several of whom are still being held in secret detention. China is not alone in seeking to curtail the activities of non-governmental and civil society organisations, with activists warning of similar moves in places including Cambodia, Egypt, India, and Russia.  Last year campaigners claimed the world was witnessing the \u201cviral-like spread of new laws\u201d targeting such groups.  In a statement the Chinese Human Rights Defenders group, which is run by overseas activists, criticised the \u201cdraconian\u201d new law.

As the high-profile mediator of the stuttering peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Blair had to be careful not to mix business with pleasure. However, one of those lunching with Powell at the annual \u201cglobal mediator\u2019s retreat\u201d, organised by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was looking to make a deal. Nawaf Obaid, a security analyst who accompanied Prince Faisal, emailed Powell a week later, according to documents seen by the Guardian, with a suggestion to work with his brother Tarek\u2019s company, PetroSaudi, which he \u201cco-founded and co-owns with Prince Turki bin Abdullah, son of King Abdullah\u201d. \u201cThey have several projects that [they] are working [on] and I think it would [give] a very interesting perspective to see if we could establish a strategic partnership with former PM Tony Blair and yourself,\u201d he wrote.     Tarek Obaid    Tarek Obaid was a former banker who styled himself as an adviser to members of the Saudi royal family and a director of a joint venture with Malaysia\u2019s multibillion-dollar development fund, 1MDB. This fund had put $300m through PetroSaudi and as the latter\u2019s chief executive, Obaid was on the lookout for deals.  On paper PetroSaudi looked impressive: its chief investment officer was a former Goldman Sachs banker, Patrick Mahony. The chief operating officer was listed as Rick Haythornthwaite, a City insider who was also chairman of Network Rail and MasterCard.  Blair\u2019s team sold the former prime minister as someone who could help \u201cunlock situations which might otherwise be blocked by political factors\u201d in places such as China and Africa. PetroSaudi was interested in Beijing\u2019s appetite for oil and how Blair\u2019s firm could help.   Blair's connections   The role assumed by Blair shows his influence in one of the most important areas of global economic cooperation this century: between the oil sands of the Middle East and hydrocarbon-hungry China. While in office, Blair oversaw the handover of Hong Kong to China, but visited the latter just five times. His sixth visit in 2007 \u2013 when he earned \u00a3200,000 for a speech in the industrial city of Dongguan \u2013 marked a turning point in how he viewed the rising power. Since then Blair has been back two dozen times and has built a reputation for befriending the rising stars of Chinese politics. In March 2010 he secured a meeting with Li Keqiang, now China\u2019s premier. PetroSaudi signed up Blair\u2019s team to lobby Beijing in the summer of 2010 and internal PetroSaudi correspondence reveals there were questions raised about the apparently opaque nature of Blair\u2019s businesses and the role he could play.   Related: Tony Blair courted Chinese leaders for Saudi prince's oil firm    PetroSaudi executives warned in early September 2010 that they had \u201cno contractual nexus with TB\u201d and were anxious about \u201cthe lack of apparent employment or other involvement of TB in the corporate structure\u201d. To convince PetroSaudi that if it paid it would get Blair, his executives revealed for the first time how his complex web of companies worked. Blair\u2019s businesses are split into two wings: Firerush, which was governed by the then City regulator the Financial Services Authority, and Windrush, which was not. What bothered PetroSaudi was that it was paying roughly $55,000 to Firerush and about $10,000 to Windrush. Both firms trade as Tony Blair Associates (TBA).   Blair's companies   From early on in their relationship PetroSaudi executives admitted they knew \u201cvery little\u201d about Blair\u2019s firms. In an email in August 2010, the company\u2019s executives said they \u201cwould like to understand more about the structure and the relationship between Firerush, TB Associates and TB. In particular, the engagement letter mentions the provision of services by employees of Firerush which seems, like a number of concepts in the engagement letter, inappropriate given we are only looking to engage with TB.\u201d To allay concerns in November 2010, Varun Chandra, a former Lehman Brothers banker and director of TBA, told PetroSaudi that Blair was the \u201cultimate owner of all this and owns all the share capital\u201d of all the companies. He told PetroSaudi it was not relevant which company got paid \u201cgiven where the cash ultimately ends up\u201d. Chandra explained that Firerush executives handled the day-to-day conversations about \u201cspecific opportunities and making the arrangements to drive negotiations forward. Tony, procured by Windrush, is involved at higher level but on an ongoing basis, meeting with senior political leadership and business heads in order to discuss PetroSaudi at a strategic level and to speak highly of your management.\u201d PetroSaudi, he said, had already seen the benefit as \u201cthe man in charge of China\u2019s economic policy is now supportive of working with PetroSaudi, and \u2026 he has spoken with CNPC [China National Petroleum Corporation] to ensure a proper working dialogue\u201d. By November 2010 TBA was hired and, according to the documents, Blair had found time to put PetroSaudi\u2019s case to Lou Jiwei, the then chairman of the China Investment Corporation and now the nation\u2019s finance minister.

Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images    Questions could be raised about why Blair was allowed to promote the interests of the son of the then ruler of Saudi Arabia in China while also working as the Middle East peace envoy for the Quartet \u2013 the US, UN, EU and Russia. Blair had also faced criticism for halting a Serious Fraud Office inquiry in 2006, while prime minister, into alleged corruption over a multibillion-pound arms deal with Saudi Arabia. He denies any conflict of interest. PetroSaudi had made it clear it wanted to hire Blair. In an internal 2010 document entitled \u201cstory for Blair\u201d, PetroSaudi sold itself as a \u201cvehicle of the Saudi royal family\u201d that could count on the \u201cfull support from the kingdom\u2019s diplomatic corps\u201d and was set up by Prince Turki bin Abdullah and Obaid, who hailed from a \u201cprominent business family\u201d. PetroSaudi\u2019s pitch in the document was that it claimed \u201cmany countries will get a company in but then bully it around once it is there and has sunk billions of dollars in the ground. This will not happen with [PetroSaudi] because these nations do not want to get on the wrong side of the Saudi royal family.\u201d But access to the legendary Blair contacts book does not come cheap. In July TBA\u2019s then chief operating officer, Mark Labovitch, emailed Mahony to say he had \u201cdiscussed your strategy and objectives with Tony and believe strongly that we can add value to PetroSaudi\u2019s business development \u2026 We would propose a retainer fee of $100,000 per month.\u201d There is no suggestion that either Blair or PetroSaudi acted improperly. The documents reveal that even before Blair\u2019s company was hired, he was already promoting the oil firm. In late July 2010 Blair was in Shanghai to celebrate the planting of 1m trees in north-west China to combat climate change. A few days later, Labovitch emailed the London-based oil firm to say: \u201cTony has just been in China and informally sounded out a number of people.\u201d Tarek Obaid and Blair did meet privately in early July 2010, and apparently discussed a working relationship. A month later Blair\u2019s company was on a retainer fee of $65,000 and a \u201csuccess fee equal to 2%\u201d of any deal that TBA brought to the company \u2013 which PetroSaudi admitted could \u201cpotentially be a very large sum\u201d. In the following months a picture emerges of corporate bonhomie underwritten by spiky internal exchanges over the cost of hiring the former prime minister, his apparent obsession with privacy and a whirl of phone calls with global leaders. By August 2010, according to documents, PetroSaudi raised concerns internally that TBA\u2019s proposed contract was \u201cmore appropriate to an investment bank (eg they can record our phone calls)\u201d. In an email, Mahony described the contract offered by Blair\u2019s lieutenants as \u201ca very aggressive first draft with almost total limitation of liability for TB\u201d. He wrote: \u201cI should note that the aggressive starting position of his engagement letter most probably is cynically reliant on counterparties taking a passive approach to secure his services.\u201d But at the end of the month Blair was in the Chinese capital for the signing of a partnership agreement between Peking University and his Faith Foundation, and managed to squeeze in some time with the Chinese oil giants CNPC and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, as well as China\u2019s supreme economic council, the National Development and Reform Commission.

Photograph: China Daily/Reuters    \u201cThe latter effectively \u2018blessed\u2019 your engagement with Chinese companies, and the former were both very keen to meet you and work out how you might collaborate,\u201d Blair\u2019s then chief operating officer told PetroSaudi. \u201cWe clearly articulated the benefits of partnership with you to them, which they grasped immediately.\u201d In November, Blair was back in Beijing to give a speech for his Faith Foundation. He also had a meeting with China\u2019s vice-premier, Wang Qishan, who Blair\u2019s firm told PetroSaudi was \u201ccrucial \u2013 inter alia in order to highlight the wider benefits of a partnership with PetroSaudi in terms of putting Chinese companies in pole position for Saudi infrastructure tenders\u201d. Wang is now a member of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s politbureau, the country\u2019s highest decision-making body. Blair\u2019s relationship with PetroSaudi appeared to give him access to the Saudi elite. In December 2010 an executive of PetroSaudi said the company could arrange a dinner for Blair with Prince Turki. Blair\u2019s office say this never took place.  The next month Blair\u2019s office emailed PetroSaudi because he was keen to meet the King of Saudi Arabia and Prince Bandar, the secretary general of the country\u2019s national security council, before the February 2011 Quartet meeting to discuss Middle East peace after the Egyptian revolution.", "tags": ["Tony Blair", "China", "Saudi Arabia", "Oil", "Asia Pacific", "Business", "Commodities", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "World news", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-28T21:00:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/iron-maiden-forced-to-alter-show-china-beijing-shanghai-censorship", "sentences": ["Earlier this week, the metal veterans played two shows in China \u2013 in Beijing and Shanghai \u2013 as part of their Book of Souls world tour.", "Singer Bruce Dickinson was forbidden to swear on stage, though in Shanghai he got round that restriction by mouthing the relevant words silently during his between-songs chat.", "On both of their visits to China, the Rolling Stones had songs excised from their set, something Mick Jagger referred to from the stage during a 2014 show in Shanghai."], "title": "Iron Maiden forced to alter their show to play in China", "article": "Iron Maiden have become the latest band to change their live performance in order to satisfy the Chinese government. Earlier this week, the metal veterans played two shows in China \u2013 in Beijing and Shanghai \u2013 as part of their Book of Souls world tour. The band had to change lyrics and drop special effects and stage props, according the metal site Blabbermouth. Singer Bruce Dickinson was forbidden to swear on stage, though in Shanghai he got round that restriction by mouthing the relevant words silently during his between-songs chat. \u201cWe ripped it up in Beijing, and we thought, \u2018Ooh, that was a bit serious,\u2019 you know,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cSo they had a few rules, so we kind of stuck by the rules, and we didn\u2019t do any swearing.

Maiden follow many other bands, famous and little-known, in having to to alter their show to suit the Chinese authorities, who clamp down on both political themes and vulgarity. Bands are expected to submit details of their performance, and even their complete lyrics, before visiting the country. Despite their qualms, the Chinese authorities were happy for Maiden to play a song about Satan (The Number of the Beast) and about the last hours of a man condemned to hang (Hallowed Be thy Name). That can result in some unintentionally comedic alterations, as when the Danish band Rock Hard Power Spray played the Midi music festival in Beijing in 2007 and had to change the title of their song Fucks for Free to Fox for Free in order to get permission to perform. On both of their visits to China, the Rolling Stones had songs excised from their set, something Mick Jagger referred to from the stage during a 2014 show in Shanghai. \u201cAnd now we\u2019d usually play something like Honky Tonk Women \u2026 but it\u2019s been vetoed,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["Iron Maiden", "Music", "Metal", "Censorship", "Pop and rock", "China", "Culture", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-29T08:57:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/29/lewis-hamilton-f1-focus-richard-williams", "sentences": ["So there must be some reason for Hamilton\u2019s current eclipse, in which the Englishman has started the new season by finishing second in Melbourne, third in Bahrain and seventh in Shanghai.", "In Shanghai the penalties imposed for changing his engine and gearbox meant that he started from the back\u00a0of the grid and was caught up in a first-lap collision, which left him requiring a new front wing and\u00a0caused further residual\u00a0damage."], "title": "Lewis Hamilton has been slow off the mark and must recover his F1 focus | Richard Williams", "article": "Lewis Hamilton made his first appearance in the Sunday Times Rich List this week, a current fortune estimated at \u00a3106m taking him into the ranks of Britain\u2019s wealthiest 1,000 people. He is pretty much at the back of the grid, 902 places and approximately \u00a33.1bn below Sir Philip and Lady Green, but still. If that were not enough to confirm his arrival among the elite, on Tuesday he attended a party in New York given for the 100 people nominated by Time magazine as the most influential on the planet. One of only five of the 100 who were chosen to give a speech to the assembled company, he was also pleased by the reception he received when his face appeared on the big screen. \u201cI was sitting next to some people,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I said: \u2018Was it me, or did I seem to get a warmer response than everyone else?\u2019 And they were like, \u2018Yeah!\u2019\u201d (Perhaps it should be pointed out that although Donald Trump and Nicki Minaj turned up, Pope Francis and Vladimir Putin were no-shows.)   Related: Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button repeat opposition to F1 changes for 2017    He arrived in Sochi for this weekend\u2019s Russian Grand Prix sounding relaxed and talking about how much he had enjoyed doing a bit of child-minding for members of his family in recent days. You would never have guessed that two weeks ago he failed to win a grand prix for the sixth time on the spin \u2013 a losing streak that demands analysis, given the advantages he enjoys. With by far the fastest car in the current Formula One field at his disposal, the reigning world champion has lost all six of those races to Nico Rosberg, the man he beat to the title in 2014 and 2015. He stands 36 points behind his fellow Mercedes driver and although there are still 18 races to go he is firmly on the back foot and urgently requiring a change of fortune. Two seasons ago Hamilton took his second championship, and his first as a Mercedes driver, in the final round in Abu Dhabi, having clawed his way back against Rosberg by taking six of the last seven races. By comparison, last year was a cakewalk. He won 10 of the first 17 races before Rosberg closed the season with a hat-trick after the destiny of the championship had been settled. Rosberg is a fine driver and there are times when he looks better attuned than Hamilton to the relentless technical demands made of today\u2019s drivers. He is also hungry for a first world title. Few people, however, would claim that he is the equal of his team-mate in terms of raw speed. So there must be some reason for Hamilton\u2019s current eclipse, in which the Englishman has started the new season by finishing second in Melbourne, third in Bahrain and seventh in Shanghai. You can point to the small pieces of misfortune. After starting from pole position at Albert Park, he was forced wide in the first corner and dropped from first to sixth place. On pole again in Bahrain, he was beaten off the line by Rosberg and then hit by another\u00a0car, inflicting damage that handicapped him for the rest of the race. In Shanghai the penalties imposed for changing his engine and gearbox meant that he started from the back\u00a0of the grid and was caught up in a first-lap collision, which left him requiring a new front wing and\u00a0caused further residual\u00a0damage.    Sometimes he gives the impression that if he had the choice of being Lewis Hamilton or Jay Z, he\u2019d choose the latter    Those costly bad starts led to suggestions that Hamilton is adapting less easily than Rosberg to a new type of manual clutch operation used to get the two Mercedes cars off the line. A poor start often leads to a chain of problems. As champions from Fangio through Clark to Schumacher knew, the safest place to be is always at the front. But the most tempting explanation for Hamilton\u2019s puzzlingly indifferent performances over the past half-dozen races is that on the morning after a victory in the US Grand Prix at Austin last October gave him his third world title and brought him level with his hero Ayrton Senna, Hamilton took his foot off the throttle. He would never admit it, of course. They never do. But sometimes it happens, even in the highly professional, super-competitive world of Formula One. Unlike James Hunt, another British world champion, who suddenly walked away in the middle of the 1979 season at the age of 31, Hamilton has not eased up because he has suddenly got scared. Hamilton is 31, too, but life in a Formula One cockpit in 2016 is very different from the way it was in the late 1970s. Despite the freakish accident that took the life of Jules Bianchi, the driver of a modern Formula One car is in a pretty safe place. No one is going to retire through a sudden realisation of the risks. Perhaps Hamilton\u2019s problem has different and less easily definable roots. A friend with a close interest in Formula One pointed out this week that since in-season testing was banned, the drivers now have a large amount of time on their hands between race meetings. Lewis, we know, has spent much of it pursuing his interest in music, particularly since he established a base in the US. Sometimes he gives the impression that if he had the choice of being Lewis Hamilton or Jay Z, he\u2019d choose the latter. And the work schedule of the modern grand prix driver gives him plenty of time, between visits to the Mercedes simulator, to pursue that interest in his own custom-built recording studio. \u201cHere I can be me,\u201d he said while giving an American TV interviewer a preview of his forthcoming album a little while ago. Has he ever been able to say the same thing of the Formula One paddock? For all his success, the mixed-race background that gave him a special kind of marketability also made him something of an outsider among a group of peers who, like Rosberg, generally embody the traditional image of the European grand prix ace. With a devastating qualifying lap in Bahrain three weeks ago \u2013 shattering Michael Schumacher\u2019s circuit record and leading Autosport\u2019s correspondent to describe it as \u201ca sublime display of controlled aggression\u201d \u2013 Hamilton demonstrated that his essential speed remains unimpaired. Perhaps he should look back to a time in the past when, after emotional problems had disrupted his performances, he successfully regained his focus. Now, before a long season gets much older, he needs to readjust his priorities and prove that he is still the master of the other attributes that made him an exceptional champion.", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One 2016", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-04-29T10:48:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/lewis-hamilton-suffers-nico-rosberg-pole-russian-f1-gp", "sentences": ["He took no part in third qualifying after suffering from the same hybrid system failure in the turbo that cost him in Shanghai, both times from overheating, and admitted to feeling \u201calmost helpless\u201d.", "\u201cIt seems like the same failure as in Shanghai, which means we have to reassess the root cause of the failure.", "Fights back to seventh in Shanghai but now trails his Mercedes rival by 36 points."], "title": "Lewis Hamilton suffers again as Nico Rosberg takes pole for Russian F1 GP", "article": "Lady luck has deserted Lewis Hamilton as the defending world champion\u2019s season suffered another setback here in Russia. Should Leicester claim the Premier League on Sunday, he may wish to ask the Buddhist monks who have been blessing the Foxes\u2019 pitch to take a swift look at his Mercedes after back-to-back failures of the same component. Hamilton has made his own luck in the past, last season dominating his team-mate, Nico Rosberg, to an extent that whatever good fortune there was seemed to bend to his implacable will. This year, with three wins from three for Rosberg, this was the race Hamilton wanted to kickstart the fightback. Instead he was left kicking his heels in the sunshine as the final part of qualifying took place without him and Rosberg claimed a dominant pole position. Trailing his team-mate by 36 points in the championship after poor starts at the opening two meetings, Hamilton still seemed shocked when the same issue that had forced him to start at the back of the grid for the last race in China scuppered his chances here. He took no part in third qualifying after suffering from the same hybrid system failure in the turbo that cost him in Shanghai, both times from overheating, and admitted to feeling \u201calmost helpless\u201d. Before qualifying the British driver was aware he had a \u201csteep mountain to climb\u201d to catch Rosberg. It is now that bit higher, with Hamilton at best starting from 10th on the grid (subject to any further penalties should he need to change a gearbox or power unit). Recovery drives from poor starts in Australia and Bahrain that dropped him from pole to sixth and ninth respectively have served him well, while coming back to seventh in China was as much as might have expected, but he knows he cannot continue to fall much further from the lead. \u201cThe goal is moving further and further away in the distance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can, there\u2019s nothing else I can do. This is another big challenge and the challenge is becoming greater. Every challenge is an opportunity to rise.\u201d That the stewards issued him with just a reprimand for cutting the corner at turn two would have been the only news to have lifted his spirits. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bizarre situation,\u201d the Mercedes motorsport head, Toto Wolff, told Sky Sports. \u201cIt seems like the same failure as in Shanghai, which means we have to reassess the root cause of the failure. He seems to have all the bad luck and the other side of the garage has all the luck.\u201d A win for Rosberg would make it four this season to add to the three he took at the close of 2015, momentum that is hard to ignore and there is no reason to doubt he should not take a pole-to-flag victory here as he did in China, such is the dominance of his Mercedes. The pole, with a time of 1.35.417 \u2013 his second of the season and the 24th of his career, equalling Niki Lauda \u2013 was nailed in one run and with Hamilton out, Rosberg chose to not even set another time. His confidence was well justified. Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel finished in second, still a full seven-tenths of a second back from Rosberg, and the oft-suggested threat from the Scuderia looks highly unlikely to make its presence felt in Sochi. Indeed a grid penalty for a gearbox change means Vettel will start in seventh, with the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, who qualified in third, alongside Rosberg on the front row. Rosberg, with admirable skill and commitment, nailed his lap on a tricky surface that offers great grip but must be handled with care. Qualifying had been set up for a mighty clash before fate intervened. Hamilton had complained of a lack of grip and that he was struggling with balance during practice, although he topped two of the three sessions and initially appeared to have edge over his team-mate , going one 10th of a second quicker in first qualifying. However in second qualifying, Rosberg had broken the track record with a time of 1.35.337 on his opening run, from which Hamilton was almost half a second down on his first outing. The world champion had opted to come out again on a new set of the supersoft tyres \u2013 with rubber usage unlikely to be an issue in a race that will surely consist of only one stop \u2013 in an attempt to find a way to reel in Rosberg. But it was to be his final run as the car gave out on him, leaving another hard day in the office in prospect and a highly unusual hint of frustration with the team that have so far helped him to secure two of his three titles. \u201cWe did 800km a day in testing and the car was faultless,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden two times in a row the same thing.

Indeed, the suggestion that Mercedes are somehow trying to steer the championship into Rosberg\u2019s hands has now been mentioned often enough that the team addressed it after the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going to respond to every lunatic that sends a message,\u201d said the team\u2019s executive director, Toto Wolff. \u201cSome of them are abusing the team and abusing members of the team and I would never allow that.

At the time the team claimed it was just to keep things fresh but with it has come the problems to a car that was almost bulletproof in testing. Hamilton was having none of it, however. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of my guys, the guys on my side of the garage are having a hard time at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cSince I joined this team I had a group of guys and for no particular reason it was swapped and those guys have come over and now we have had some bad experiences and I imagine they are feeling the pressure but it\u2019s nothing to do with them.\u201d Hamilton is nothing if not happy to repeat his assertion that his team win and lose together and has never pointed the finger at his crew, something that would not begin here. \u201cThey are doing a fantastic job,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no reason we can\u2019t win its just that we have these bugs coming along.\u201dWolff said after the race that Rosberg had experienced a technical problem as well, which he described as \u201ca strange signal from the power unit\u201d. It did not stop the German putting in the fastest lap towards the end, though, and was another nebulous enough reason for itchy fingers to start typing on Twitter. This was becoming all too much for Wolff. \u201cI think it is difficult to take people out there seriously when they are lying in their beds with their laptops on their chests sending those abusive messages out,\u201d he said \u201cYou wonder what goes through their minds. Lewis has won two championships with this team. The reason why I am being vocal about it is because those guys are being hit by comments that are unfair and outright abusive without reason. We have made a few mistakes and let Lewis down but some of those guys could take it hard.\u201d That Mercedes, a team that have positively revelled in Hamilton\u2019s victories over the past two years and spend a fortune competing in Formula One, might actively sabotage one of their drivers is a nonsense barely worth a response.

The contract with The Crucible comes to an end next year and there had been speculation that the world championship \u2013 which earns \u00a35m for Sheffield over the 17 days of the competition \u2013 could leave the city and even move abroad. But as Selby and Ding slugged through 17 frames on the first day of the two-day encounter, with the former taking an overnight lead of 10-7 in the best-of-35 final, the 40th at the famous theatre, Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, told The Guardian: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us in the sport have the heart to change.

He said: \u201cThe restriction here is the venue itself. I can\u2019t criticise the venue because it\u2019s the greatest atmosphere on the world snooker tour. It\u2019s drama and it creates everything we want. But if we look at the size and scale of the sport now, we could easily fill 3,000 seats, which would be about right for the world championship. We\u2019re already doing about 2,500 for the German Masters in Berlin and the atmosphere is incredible.\u201d Beyond the next deal, snooker is looking at the possibility of moving to a new, bespoke venue in the city \u2013 or even enlarging the capacity at The Crucible. Ferguson believes Ding\u2019s first appearance in the world championship final has taken the sport to a new level of interest in China. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s already huge in China. They\u2019ve got 1,500 snooker clubs in Shanghai alone, 1,200 in Beijing. These are huge numbers. In participation it is big but in media and television it is also very big and if Ding wins, it has the potential to be enormous. I know that a great nation is viewed to the television hoping their man is going to win.\u201d Viewers in China must have been subdued when Ding went 6-0 down in the opening session, before pulling back to 6-2. He had been the form player in this championship and was up against a man who had not shown his true form until the concluding stages of his semi-final against Marco Fu on Saturday night. But he looked nervous in the opening exchanges as Selby, whose confidence survived the replacement of his cue tip, took control and enjoyed breaks of 120, 91 and 76. In the second, nine-frame session, however, Ding won three of the first four frames to cut the deficit to 7-5. After the interval the next two frames were shared before an epic, 66-minute frame was eventually won by Ding after Selby had failed to secure the snookers he needed. TV commentator and former world champion John Parrott compared Selby, nicknamed The Torturer, with \u201ca boa constrictor\u201d. Despite winning the frame Ding\u2019s fluency had been broken and Selby won the final two frames of the night. Ferguson, meanwhile, has his eyes on India as snooker\u2019s next boom nation.

He has been a political anorak since his teens, and was an accountant before becoming an MP in 1997. Currently he is the schools minister, working under Nicky Morgan.  Ah yes, that should ring a bell.   When Morgan, put into education to calm things down after the Maoist reign of Michael Gove (the joke is David Cameron\u2019s own), faced a hostile teachers\u2019 conference last week, someone asked if she or Gibb was in charge of policy. She called her challenger \u201csexist\u201d, not an impressive reply from a cabinet minister.   Related: Primary school tests boycott draws scattered support     The reason behind the teacher\u2019s jibe is that Morgan is emollient, but Gibb is gripped by the cult of rigour and the row over Sats tests for six- and seven-year-olds. It prompted some parents to show their devotion to their children\u2019s education by taking them out of school this week in protest. They have their reasons, but we seem to live in an age gripped by irrationality.    Related: The rights and wrongs of testing 10-year-olds on modal verbs | Letters     Gibb was not quite rigorous enough to pass a Sats grammar test question set for 11-year-olds when challenged by the BBC\u2019s Martha Kearney on Tuesday. Kearney giggled with glee when he guessed wrong. Hoist by his own petard, as a Gibb-trained six-year-old would put it.  But Gibb is a 55-year-old Tory on the libertarian wing of the party, an ally of Hague, then of Portillo, fastidious enough not to serve under IDS (not enough GCSEs, Iain), and schools minister twice since 2010. A Kent grammar school boy who moved to Roundhay grammar-turned-comprehensive in middle-class Leeds (did he spot that Margaret Thatcher made the change?), he is a champion of phonics (not suitable for all) and of rigour. Someone unkindly leaked the remark that he would prefer an Oxbridge grad without a teacher training certificate (PGCE) teaching physics than someone from \u201cone of the rubbish universities\u201d with one.  That is such a rubbish remark, I could weep. Say after me Nick, that Apple\u2019s Sir Jonathan Ive, one of the most influential designers of our times, studied industrial design at Newcastle Poly, now Northumbria University. There are plenty more such talents emerging (and teaching) at many of our \u201crubbish\u201d universities. Snobbery from the likes of Maidstone Grammar and Durham University\u2019s Gibb (he read law) has done as much as anything to cripple the once mighty British industrial base. They looked down on Stephenson and Brunel too. Perhaps the new wave of Ms Brunels  will turn things around.  That said, I have some sympathy with Gibb\u2019s complaint about the lack of rigour in much of what our kids learn. In my case it is grandchildren and great nieces these days. Some of it is creative and wonderful, dazzling me with its maturity and sophistication. Foreigners cudgeled into submission by rote learning sometimes marvel at it.  But I know that international league tables repeatedly highlight profound weaknesses in the basic skills of English and maths and that, as so often in our kind of society, it is the poor and vulnerable who are least well served. Their \u201cpoverty of ambition\u201d \u2013 as the great trade unionist, Ernest Bevin, put it \u2013 is reinforced by society\u2019s indifference.     The schools minister, Nick Gibb, is not a parent himself. Photograph: Alastair Johnstone / SWNS.com for the Guardian     You don\u2019t need to be able to add up or multiply if you have a calculator? OK if you say so, but you may not always have one. It must be crippling not to know that 3x17 is 51 when you\u2019re scoring at the bottom left-hand corner of the pub dartboard. Put another way, when we lived in the suburbs of Washington DC, my 10-year-old encountered a level of maths he did not meet again back in London until he was 16. Gibb says we are three years behind the Chinese at 15. Scary stuff.  The question here is, as usual, how do we best go about improving things? Standards, not structures, was David Blunkett\u2019s mantra at education (1997-2001), but this government seems to be throwing both challenges at teachers in what strikes me as a dogmatic way, one learned by rote, you might say.   I was horrified when George Osborne (what\u2019s it to do with him?) announced that all schools must become academies. What about choice for parents and local authorities? Why are academy chains failing too, as the Gove-picked regulator, Sir Michael Wilshaw, protested?  It has the hallmarks of another Andrew (\u201cno top-down reform\u201d) Lansley disaster, compounded by the quite extraordinary decision to replace parent governors with \u201ctrained\u201d professionals. Gibb himself is not a parent. If he was he might know it is often the parents who really know where a school is failing and what should be done about it.  The professionalisation of everything (usually for a fee) is another of the debilitating vices of our time. No wonder parents are anxious about their parenting skills, let alone about whether or not Alice and Timothy are going to be able to compete with youngsters in Shanghai. Little do they know that Silicon Valley robotics are striving to make all of them unemployed.  It is also no wonder the kids get anxious when confronted (at six!) with split digraphs and polysyllabic words in their Sats test. Or that they are such nervous wrecks by the time they go to university that they impose \u201csafe spaces\u201d and \u201cno platform\u201d policies in which they can be protected from unsettling ideas. Gibb seems to have the same problem, and he\u2019s 55.  Let\u2019s not go there today. I don\u2019t like the idea of testing six- and seven-year-olds, many of whom are immature for a variety of reasons and don\u2019t need to be discouraged by split digraphs, whatever they are. Children go to school earlier in Britain than in some countries where they seem to achieve better standards later on.    Related: Dear Ms Morgan: Sats tests are putting young children through hell     So reports that some are showing signs of distress at the Sats challenge are therefore understandable. It is the job of parents and teachers, working calmly together, to ease such fears. Other children will sail through the tests, of course, and crow about it. That\u2019s not good for them either. Six is too young to wield the cosh. Teachers and parents, not Nicky and Nick, are the key to a successfully educated child. Personally, I would worry more about what screen time is doing to their powers of concentration (it\u2019s not doing much for mine) and book-reading habits. Or is that old-fashioned too? We\u2019ll find out.  But cheer up. Last night my wife and I saw a raunchy production of Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus at the theatre. Since Kit Harington \u2013 Jon Snow of Game of Thrones fame \u2013 was playing the title role, the place was packed with noisy young people. Excellent for a new generation of theatregoers, as Lyn Gardner argues. Marlowe\u2019s Elizabethan prose, rich and vivid, must have been quite a shock for some of them, more so than the actors getting their kit off. But they were all still there after the interval, much fired up. When I got home and safely into bed I looked it all up on the iPad.

It opened on October 14, 1966, as part of the original network of the Metro, and it is one of two metro stations which service Montreal\u2019s Gay Village, part of the Centre-South district in the borough of Ville-Marie.  The station features a set of three murals by Jean Cartier and George Juhasz. Entitled Les Patriotes de 1837\u20131838 the murals tell the story of the Patriotes Rebellion and commemorate Louis-Joseph Papineau, the famous son of this station\u2019s namesake Joseph Papineau, a notary, surveyor, politician, and defender of the rights of the people and of the French language. Joy Q. Wang frequently used the station when she lived in the city, and feels the system can be improved. \u201cThe underground system in Montreal is extremely old, but is fully functional and quite speedy compared to other systems I know. There are always a lot of maintenance needs, sometimes during rush hour, so that was always very inconvenient. The ticket prices are $3.25 for a one-way trip or $6 if you buy a roundtrip at the same time. Since I commuted quite frequently but not every day, I bought a 10-trip passes at a time which is $26.50.\u201d     Station Papineau in Montreal, Canada Photograph: Joy Q. Wang/GuardianWitness    Delancey Street subway station, New York Steven Godfrey spotted the subway mural Shad Crossing on a recent visit to New York. Originally from Vancouver, Canada he appreciated the depiction of nature in a very urban setting . \u201cWith ready access to the Pacific ocean, and great swaths of nature, salmon culture is the very foundation of British Columbia\u2019s identity. So I was delighted when my partner and I came upon this beautiful tiled work depiction of fish swimming through a very urban transit station.\u201d  The artwork on the downtown side of Delancey Street subway station is the work of Shanghai-born New York-based artist Ming Fay. Installed in 2004 it features two giant shad fish swimming, along with another wall mosaic of blue waters. In the late 19th century, shad were found along the Hudson River when new immigrants came to New York, many of whom settled on the Lower East Side.  Delancey Street station was opened on January 1, 1936 and is a station on the IND Sixth Avenue Line that runs mainly under Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, and continues south through the Rutgers Street Tunnel to Brooklyn. Steven was very impressed with the New York\u2019s subway system, and the interesting artwork he discovered at its many stations. \u201cThe subway is a great way to explore the city, and its station art creates a sense of place, when travelling through New York. The only specific improvement I can think of is an app or maps that help visitors better understand when certain trains are or aren\u2019t operating. We had a couple of evenings where we ended up in the wrong place because the train we planned on using wasn\u2019t operating.\u201d     Fish in New York\u2019s Delancey Street Subway Station Photograph: itcaughtmyeye/GuardianWitness    Hallonbergen station, Stockholm Hallonbergen station lies on the blue line of the Stockholm metro, located in Sundbyberg just north of the capital. Opened on 31 August 1975. The station\u2019s interior is decorated with children\u2019s drawings, and was designed by Swedish artists Elis Eriksson and G\u00f6sta Wallmark. David Bertho visited the station when visiting his sister-in-law. \u201cI\u2019d noticed that several Stockholm metro stations had remarkable designs, so I wanted to capture some of the best ones. It took me two afternoons to visit and shoot around 20 of my favourite stations.\u201d  David is originally from Paris and is fascinated by both the contrasts and similarities of the two city\u2019s metro systems. \u201cThe Paris subway is quite old and grim, so Stockholm\u2019s was quite refreshing. But metro travel is an affordable mode of transport in both cities . The frequency of the Stockholm metro could be better. What would make the wait between trains more interesting is more displayed information about the stations\u2019 designs.\u201d     Hallonbergen station in Stockholm Photograph: David Bertho/GuardianWitness    Arbatskaya station, Moscow Completed in 1935 Arbatskaya station was one of the original metro stations in the city. Designed by architect L. Teplitskiy it has ceramic tiled walls, pink marbled pillars and granite platforms. The station is part of the Filyovskaya Line which connects the western districts of Dorogomilovo and Fili and Moscow city centre.  Cengiz Sarikayali visited Moscow on holiday last year and was very impressed with the underground network. \u201cDue to its location, Arbatskaya Metro station is quite busy, and used by many Moscovite commuters. The circular underground transportation system in Moscow resembles that of a cobweb. It\u2019s a very busy and a convenient system. During the Second World War, the underground system was used as a shelter. With its well kept and lit chandeliers, decorations, ornaments and artwork, I can easily describe some of the stations as \u201cunderground palaces.\u201d Cengiz also thinks travelling on the city\u2019s underground system is good value for money. \u201cI bought tickets valid for three days for myself, my wife and my son and in total paid 1.200 rubles.

After nearly 50 years it was time for renovation to repair any damage that had built up over the years. The work on Wartenau started on August 2007 and finished on March 2008. The colour red wasn\u2019t chosen for any particular reason. It was felt that Wartenau benefited from a darker colour without being too dark. Red was perfect.

One was for determining gestational age; the other for the systematic neurological examination of the newborn. The scientists were Victor and Lilly Dubowitz. Lilly, who has died aged 85, was a leading figure in the field of neonatology, and her pioneering work spanning more than 40 years is internationally recognised. The Dubowitz score and the Dubowitz neonatal examination have been used by generations of neonatologists and paediatric neurologists. The assessment of gestational age in the newborn infant, developed with Victor and published in 1970, was immediately adopted worldwide as a way of distinguishing small babies who were mature but malnourished from those who were premature and of appropriate small size. It measured some neurological signs, such as the infant\u2019s ability to flex and extend its joints and limbs, and also some superficial signs, examining the skin, eyes, ears, genitals and other physical characteristics for signs of maturity. From these, after the examiner had matched the infant\u2019s responses with the options on an illustrative chart, came the Dubowitz score. The beauty of the test was that it was simple and easily recorded through clinical observation.   In the US, clinicians paid the couple the compliment of turning their surname into a verb: \u201cHave you Dubowitzed the baby?\u201d they started to ask. In 1980, also in collaboration with Victor, she developed the neurological assessment of the pre-term and full-term newborn, providing diagrammatic charts and instructions on how to perform a neurological examination of the newborn infant. Special attention was paid to babies born prematurely who, until then, were thought to be impossible to assess because of the lack of appropriate clinical tools. The neurological examination combined the neurological signs of the gestational age assessment with observation of certain behaviour, such as the ability to fix and follow an object with the eyes \u2013 movements and reflexes that can be observed even in the premature baby. The examiner could again consult a chart and compare results: both excessive or diminished reactions might be abnormal. Both these assessments have been widely used in research, but they also became very popular with clinicians, which reflected Lilly\u2019s determination to develop methods that could be easily performed even by relatively inexperienced staff in everyday clinical practice. One of Lilly\u2019s missions was to travel to developing countries, including Papua New Guinea and Malawi, and to the Karen refugee camps in Thailand. Here the assessments were used to distinguish between babies who were small because they were born prematurely and babies who were small because of nutritional deficiency. They also monitored the effect on the infants of antimalarial drugs in the mother. Lilly was born in Budapest to Hedwig and Julius Seb\u00f6k. Her father, a Jewish textile engineer, was sent to a heavy labour camp when the Germans entered Hungary and died of a heart attack shortly after being released. Lilly and her mother survived the second world war in hiding, with false papers provided by the Swedish embassy. Lilly matriculated in Budapest in 1948, and soon afterwards she and her mother emigrated to Australia to join her mother\u2019s family from Vienna, who had survived the war in Shanghai. There she found work to support herself and her mother, both as a waitress and in a biochemistry lab. She soon developed the urge to study medicine, and managed to talk her way into doing this part-time, alongside her salaried work. She graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1956, and in 1958 she was sent to London for postgraduate training in endocrinology at Hammersmith hospital. The chance encounter over Easter weekend in 1960 with Victor Dubowitz, at a friend\u2019s picnic at Virginia Water, Surrey, changed the course of her life. They were engaged after two weeks and married three months later. Soon after their marriage, the couple moved to Sheffield, where Victor had an academic post. While waiting for the transfer of her Medical Research Council grant, Lilly was invited to fill a temporary senior registrar vacancy in paediatrics. She often referred to herself as an accidental paediatrician. In her new role, she developed a strong interest in newborn and infant development, and later said that working with neonates was a very suitable field, because she could meet all the needs of her own four small children at home and work on her newborn research at night. She was awarded a doctorate in medicine by Sheffield University in 1973. In 1972 the family moved to London, where, at Hammersmith hospital, she pioneered the use of cranial ultrasound imaging in newborn infants. In the mid-1980s, she was also involved in introducing magnetic resonance imaging, a technique used in adults but not yet in young children, to assess the newborn brain. Her focus in understanding the newborn brain by combining bedside clinical assessment with new sophisticated techniques as part of an integrated approach has changed the field of neonatal neurology and laid the foundations for the research that has developed in recent years. After retiring in 1995, she continued to maintain a strong interest in the field of neonatal neurology and was generous with her support to her former students, many of whom are now leading experts in the field. She received many prizes and awards and an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of London. There was more to Lilly than her academic or clinical career. In the 20 years after her formal retirement, she applied her scientific research methods to piece together clues and details about her long-lost uncle, Stefan Seb\u00f6k, an architect who had worked with Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus on the Totaltheater designs in the late 1920s, and with L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy on the light-space modulator before joining the Vesnin brothers to work on the Moscow Metro designs. The day after Germany invaded Russia, he was arrested by the KGB on trumped-up charges of spying for the Germans, repeatedly interrogated and later died in Saratov prison. Much of his work was subsequently lost, forgotten or incorrectly attributed to other people. Her painstaking research on Stefan across three continents, as described in her book In Search of a Forgotten Architect (2012), has been greatly appreciated by experts in the field. Most of her information came from the KGB files in Moscow to which she obtained full access, remarking wryly that KGB files were not generally recognised as a source for architectural historians. Lilly\u2019s leisure pursuits included cooking, silk painting, pottery, photography, beadwork and collecting and restoring Persian rugs. She and Victor were inveterate globetrotters, and in her last few months they visited Iceland for the first time, and South Africa. She is survived by Victor, their four sons, David, Michael, Gerald and Daniel, and 10 grandchildren. \u2022 Lilly Dubowitz, neurologist and paediatrician, born 20 March 1930; died 14 March 2016", "tags": ["Neuroscience", "Science", "Research and development", "Research", "Higher education", "Education", "Children", "Society"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-08T15:22:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/09/translated-fiction-sells-better-uk-english-fiction-elena-ferrante-haruki-murakami", "sentences": ["Bestselling translated titles in 2001 The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho (114,430 copies sold) Shanghai Baby by Wei Hui (54,104)  Atomised by Michel Houellebecq (51,323) Bestselling translated titles in 2015 My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante (108,969)  The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair by Jo\u00ebl Dicker (87,002) Look Who\u2019s Back by Timur Vermes (68,461)"], "title": "Translated fiction sells better in the UK than English fiction, research finds", "article": "Translated literary fiction is selling better on average in the UK than literary fiction originally written in English, according to new research, with authors including Elena Ferrante, Haruki Murakami and Karl Ove Knausgaard driving a boom in sales. Though fiction in translation accounts for just 3.5% of literary fiction titles published, it accounted for 7% of sales in 2015, according to a survey commissioned by the Man Booker International prize.  The research, conducted by Nielsen Book, looked at physical book sales in the UK between January 2001 and April 2016. It found that translated fiction sales almost doubled over the last 15 years, from 1.3m to 2.5m copies, while the market for fiction as a whole fell from 51.6m in 2001 to 49.7m in 2015.  Although the proportion of translated fiction is still \u201cextremely low\u201d, at 1.5% overall, the sector still \u201cpunches well above its weight\u201d, said the book sales monitor, with that 1.5% accounting for 5% of total fiction sales in 2015. \u201cOn average, translated fiction books sell better than books originally written in English, particularly in literary fiction,\u201d said Nielsen. Looking specifically at translated literary fiction, sales rose from 1m copies in 2001 to 1.5m in 2015, with translated literary fiction accounting for just 3.5% of literary fiction titles published, but 7% of the volume of sales in 2015.    25% of our top 20 fiction titles are translated - if more were published I\u2019m sure that percentage would be even higher  Chris White, fiction buyer for Waterstones     \u201cIn 2001, every literary fiction title written in English sold an average 1,153 copies, while every translated literary fiction title sold only 482 copies. By 2015 this had completely changed \u2013 every literary fiction title written in English sold an average of only 263 copies, while every translated literary fiction title sold an average of 531 copies,\u201d said Fiammetta Rocco, administrator of the Man Booker International prize. \u201cNot only are the numbers of translated books sold going up, but there is an incredibly devoted readership in Britain of translated fiction. We were amazed to discover this \u2013 the only thing we\u2019ve known is the 3% figure and we didn\u2019t know if that related to the number of titles published, or to sales. For translated literary fiction, it turns out the proportion published is about the same, at 3.5%, but that sales are much higher, at 7%.\u201d Rocco said the research was \u201cconfirmation of the health and growth potential of international fiction in the UK\u201d, and expressed the hope that it would \u201cencourage publishers and agents to take more risks and invest in translation\u201d. This year\u2019s Man Booker International prize will be awarded for the first time to a single book translated into English, rather than an author\u2019s body of work. Deborah Smith, publisher at Tilted Axis Press and translator of Han Kang\u2019s The Vegetarian, which is shortlisted for this year\u2019s prize, said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by Nielsen Book\u2019s \u201cencouraging\u201d research. \u201cPart of the reason I became a translator in the first place was because Anglophone or Eurocentric writing often felt quite parochial. Setting up Tilted Axis Press came from a similar impulse; our focus on Asian literatures \u2013 where linguistic experimentation is informed by daily lives shifting between languages \u2013 is a brilliant way of discovering the stylistic innovation and non-conforming narratives that most excite us,\u201d said Smith. \u201cJudging by this year\u2019s Man Booker International long- and shortlists, which included titles from South Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, the Congo, the industry as a whole is definitely waking up to the fact that a lot of the most original and distinctive writing is happening in these areas. Exploring the underrepresented is also a great way to stand out in a crowded market as a publisher \u2013 when people hear we\u2019re doing the UK\u2019s first ever translation of contemporary Thai fiction, they sit up and take notice.\u201d    The 'Ferrante phenomenon' has helped drive sales of Italian fiction from 7,000 in 2001 to 237,000 in 2015    \u201cWe\u2019ve now reached a stage where not only are people happy to read fiction in translation, they are positively seeking it out,\u201d agreed Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White. \u201cCurrently 25% of our top 20 fiction titles are translated and if more were published I\u2019m sure that percentage would be higher still.\u201d White said that the growth of Scandinavian crime had \u201ccertainly helped to break down any psychological barriers or pre-conceptions which readers may have had about translated fiction\u201d. \u201cThe popularity of the likes of Stieg Larsson and Jo Nesbo has made people realise that \u2018translated\u2019 doesn\u2019t automatically equal \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018worthy\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, readers are now reading translated fiction of every description and you\u2019re as likely to find My Brilliant Friend, The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared or Look Who\u2019s Back on the bestseller tables as you are The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web.\u201d Rocco believes there are three reasons for the increase: \u201cPeople travel more and more people travel, there is highbrow foreign television coming here, so the whole landscape of foreignness is much more even \u2013 people cross boundaries much more easily. There are some stand-out authors like Knausgaard, Murakami and Ferrante. And there are also small publishers today, who were set up to deal almost entirely with translated fiction, which wasn\u2019t the case 15 years ago.\u201d   Related: Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows    French remains the most popular language for translation, with 200,000 books sold in 2001, and more than 400,000 in 2015, found Nielsen. But books were translated from 91 languages over the period studied, from Afrikaans to Yiddish. The \u201cFerrante phenomenon\u201d helped drive sales of Italian literary fiction, up from 7,000 in 2001 to 237,000 in 2015, while Korean books also boomed, up from 88 copies in 2001 to 10,191 in 2015, according to the research. By 2015, the most popular languages for translation were French, Italian, Japanese, Swedish and German, while in 2001, they were French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Mandarin. Nielsen noted that \u201cthe languages of the Indian sub-continent are extremely under-represented with just a handful of titles published from Kannada and a fall in the number of literary fiction from Hindi available in the period from 686 to 299 titles\u201d.

Terry\u2019s dismissal in stoppage time against Sunderland last weekend means he will sit out the trip to Liverpool on Wednesday and the visit of the champions on the final day. The defender will not travel to Anfield, with management staff and player fearing his presence even in the stands may provide an unwanted distraction, and is resigned to having made his last appearance for the club after 18 years and 703 games.   Related: John Terry red card rules him out of Chelsea\u2019s final two games    There is a desire from some figures at the club to make a public announcement on the centre-half\u2019s future before the last fixture of the season, rather than wait until June when confirmation was delivered over the release of players such as Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and Ashley Cole in previous years to ensure he is granted a proper sendoff on Sunday. However, as it stands, the home support will not know for sure whether the 35-year-old is to be retained when he joins his club-mates for the post-match lap of appreciation. They intend to unfurl a number of banner tributes to the captain at the fixture \u2013 Terry is being granted use of the pitch at the stadium for free to enjoy his own match with close friends on Monday \u2013 for all that Hiddink suggested the delay in an announcement was down only to those behind the scenes wanting \u201cto take their time\u201d before determining whether the offer of a one-year contract would be forthcoming. \u201cThe people who are making the decisions want to take their time, to make decisions, possibly,\u201d the interim coach said. \u201cThat\u2019s up to them. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s [been] dramatic, bad treatment so far, but everyone has his own approach to deal with this matter. It\u2019s the same as Ashley Cole and Lampard. I don\u2019t neglect the facts. \u201cBut there is a strategy. I\u2019m not having the conversation inside the club and they choose what they choose. I don\u2019t know the state of mind of the fans but my personal opinion is that when you know your plans once you know which way you\u2019re going in the future, then you can be transparent. It\u2019s up to the club. It\u2019s not up to me. It\u2019s for the board and the [new] management.\u201d There appears to be a reluctance on all sides to make the first public move confirming Terry is to sever ties with the club he joined at the age of 14. The player has been offered lucrative deals by clubs in China, believed to be Shanghai SIPG, who are coached by Sven-Goran Eriksson, and Jiangsu Suning, and would be free to pursue that move when his contract expires on 30 June. Terry has undertaken a number of profile-raising personal tours of China in recent times, and attended coaching clinics in Shanghai in March. Yet he stated on Tuesday, in an interview recorded after watching Brondby play on Monday night and released on the Danish club\u2019s YouTube channel, that his preference would be to play two further years for Chelsea. While Terry\u2019s\u2019 status as a club icon is accepted by all at Stamford Bridge, there is an acceptance that, at some stage, the club must move on from the team who swept all before them during Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first spell in charge. The defender is the last remaining stalwart from that side \u2013 Mikel John Obi is also at the club but does not enjoy the same influence \u2013 and his departure would effectively signal the end of an era. Suggestions have emerged in Italy that the new Chelsea first-team coach, Antonio Conte, would rather the board instigate the parting of the ways, though the club have been adamant the final decision will be made by the man who takes up the reins after Euro 2016. There is frustration within the set-up that Terry opted to announce no contract offer had been forthcoming immediately after the FA Cup fourth\u2011round victory at Milton Keynes Dons in January. Hiddink believes the defender can still compete at the top level in England but is unlikely to contemplate life at a top-flight rival. \u201cHe\u2019s fit enough,\u201d said the Dutchman. \u201cHe\u2019s never been a fast, fast player, but he was a fast thinker. When you look deep into his heart, he\u2019d love to be a Premier League player. He will follow his heart, I think. I\u2019m not speaking for him, but what I feel ... he will not easily go to another Premier League club.\u201d Terry is not the only Chelsea player to have played his last game of the season. Diego Costa is nursing a hamstring injury which will rule him out of the games against Liverpool and Leicester, and Branislav Ivanovic is still suffering from the groin problem that forced him from the field at Sunderland. The FA Youth Cup winners Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori will travel with the squad to Merseyside. Pedro Rodr\u00edguez will be fit to feature but only having spent Monday in Milan as the latest member of the side to require a protective mask after the Spaniard broke his nose over the weekend in what Hiddink termed \u201can accident at his home\u201d.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a decade-long period of political and social chaos caused by Mao Zedong\u2019s bid to use the Chinese masses to reassert his control over the Communist party. Its bewildering complexity and almost unfathomable brutality was such that to this day historians struggle to make sense of everything that occurred during the period. However, Mao\u2019s decision to launch the \u201crevolution\u201d in May 1966 is now widely interpreted as an attempt to destroy his enemies by unleashing the people on the party and urging them to purify its ranks. When the mass mobilisation kicked off party newspapers depicted it as an epochal struggle that would inject new life into the socialist cause. \u201cLike the red sun rising in the east, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is illuminating the land with its brilliant rays,\u201d one editorial read. In fact, the Cultural Revolution crippled the economy, ruined millions of lives and thrust China into 10 years of turmoil, bloodshed, hunger and stagnation. Gangs of students and Red Guards attacked people wearing \u201cbourgeois clothes\u201d on the street, \u201cimperialist\u201d signs were torn down and intellectuals and party officials were murdered or driven to suicide. After violence had run its bloody course, the country\u2019s rulers conceded it had been a catastrophe that had brought nothing but \u201cgrave disorder, damage and retrogression\u201d. An official party reckoning described it as a catastrophe which had caused \u201cthe most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic\u201d in 1949. Whose idea was it and what was the aim? The Cultural Revolution was the brainchild of China\u2019s \u2018Great Helmsman\u2019, Chairman Mao Zedong. Seventeen years after his troops seized power, Mao saw his latest political campaign as a way of reinvigorating the communist revolution by strengthening ideology and weeding out opponents. \u201cOur objective is to struggle against and crush those persons in authority who are taking the capitalist road... so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system,\u201d one early directive stated. Frank Dik\u00f6tter, the author of a new book on the period, says Mao hoped his movement would make China the pinnacle of the socialist universe and turn him into \u201cthe man who leads planet Earth into communism.\u201d     Chinese red guards during the cultural revolution in 1966. Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images    But it was also an attempt by the elderly dictator, whose authority had been badly hit by the calamitous Great Famine of the 1950s, to reassert control over the party by obliterating enemies, real or imagined. \u201cIt was a power struggle waged... behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement,\u201d Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans wrote in his damning account of the Cultural Revolution, The Chairman\u2019s New Clothes. How exactly did it start? Most historians agree the Cultural Revolution began in mid-May 1966 when party chiefs in Beijing issued a document known as the \u201cMay 16 Notification\u201d. It warned that the party had been infiltrated by counter-revolutionary \u201crevisionists\u201d who were plotting to create a \u201cdictatorship of the bourgeoisie\u201d. A fortnight later, on 1 June, the party\u2019s official mouthpiece newspaper urged the masses to \u201cclear away the evil habits of the old society\u201d by launching an all-out assault on \u201cmonsters and demons\u201d. Chinese students sprung into action, setting up Red Guard divisions in classrooms and campuses across the country. By August 1966 - so-called Red August - the mayhem was in full swing as Mao\u2019s allies urged Red Guards to destroy the \u201cfour olds\u201d - old ideas, old customs, old habits and old culture. Schools and universities were closed and churches, shrines, libraries, shops and private homes ransacked or destroyed as the assault on \u201cfeudal\u201d traditions began.     Schools and universities were closed and private homes ransacked or destroyed as the assault on \u201cfeudal\u201d traditions began.   Gangs of teenagers in red armbands and military fatigues roamed the streets of cities such as Beijing and Shanghai setting upon those with \u201cbourgeois\u201d clothes or reactionary haircuts. \u201cImperialist\u201d street signs were torn down.     Gangs of teenagers in red armbands and military fatigues roamed the streets of cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.   Party officials, teachers and intellectuals also found themselves in the cross-hairs: they were publicly humiliated, beaten and in some cases murdered or driven to suicide after vicious \u201cstruggle sessions\u201d. Blood flowed as Mao ordered security forces not to interfere in the Red Guards\u2019 work. Nearly 1,800 people lost their lives in Beijing in August and September 1966 alone. What happened next? After the initial explosion of student-led \u201cred terror\u201d, the chaos spread rapidly. Workers joined the fray and China was plunged into what historians describe as a state of virtual civil war, with rival factions battling it out in cities across the country. By late 1968 Mao realised his revolution had spiralled out of control. In a bid to rein in the violence he issued instructions to send millions of urban youth down to the countryside for \u201cre-education\u201d. He also ordered the army to restore order, effectively transforming China into a military dictatorship, which lasted until about 1971. As the army fought to bring the situation under control, the death toll soared. Between 1971 and the Cultural Revolution\u2019s official end, in 1976, a semblance of normality returned to China. US president Richard Nixon even toured the country in February 1972 in a historic visit that re-established ties between Washington and Beijing.     Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to China in 1972    It was, in Nixon\u2019s words, \u201cthe week that changed the world\u201d. How many victims were there? Historians believe somewhere between 500,000 and two million people lost their lives as a result of the Cultural Revolution. Perhaps the worst affected region was the southern province of Guangxi where there were reports of mass killings and even cannibalism.  Appalling acts of barbarity also occurred in Inner Mongolia where authorities unleashed a vicious campaign of torture against supposed separatists. Even China\u2019s feline population suffered as Red Guards tried to eliminate what they claimed was a symbol of \u201cbourgeois decadence\u201d. \u201cWalking through the streets of the capital at the end of August [1966], people saw dead cats lying by the roadside with their front paws tied together,\u201d writes Dik\u00f6tter. Yet contrary to popular belief, the government was responsible for most of the bloodshed, not the Red Guards. \u201cWe read a lot of horror stories about students beating their teachers to death in the stairwell,\u201d says Andrew Walder, the author of China Under Mao. \u201c[But] based on the government\u2019s own published histories well over half, if not two-thirds of the people who were killed or imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution suffered that from 1968 to early 1970\u201d as the army moved in to halt the violence. The lives of some of the Communist party\u2019s most powerful figures were upended by the turbulence, including future leader Deng Xiaoping, who was purged in 1967, and Xi Zhongxun, the father of China\u2019s current president, Xi Jinping, who was publicly humiliated, beaten and sent into exile. President Xi\u2019s half-sister, Xi Heping, is said to have taken her own life after being persecuted. How were foreigners affected? As chaos enveloped Beijing in the summer of 1966, foreign diplomats found themselves at the eye of the storm. \u201cEarplugs became standard embassy issue,\u201d the former British ambassador Percy Cradock writes in his memoirs recalling how a cacophony of songs praising \u201cour beloved Chairman Mao\u201d became the soundtrack of life in the capital. By the following year things had taken a more sinister turn. Red Guards laid siege to the Soviet, French and Indonesian embassies, torched the Mongolian ambassador\u2019s car and hung a sign outside the British mission that read: \u201cCrush British Imperialism!\u201d One night, in late August, diplomats were forced to flee from the British embassy as it was ransacked and burned. Outside protesters chanted: \u201cKill! Kill!\u201d. Anthony Grey, a Reuters journalist in Beijing, spent more than two years in captivity after being detained by Chinese authorities in July 1967. What was the Little Red Book? The Cultural Revolution\u2019s official handbook was the Little Red Book, a pocket-sized collection of quotations from Mao that offered a design for Red Guard life. \u201cBe resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory!\u201d read one famous counsel. At the height of the Cultural Revolution, Little Red Book reading sessions were held on public buses and even in the skies above China, as air hostesses preached Mao\u2019s words of wisdom to their passengers. During the 1960s, the Little Red Book is said to have been the most printed book on earth, with more than a billion copies printed.

Photograph: Sinopix/REX/Shutterstock    When did it end? The Cultural Revolution officially came to an end when Mao died on 9 September 1976 at the age of 82. In a bid to move on - and avoid discrediting Mao too much - party leaders ordered that the Chairman\u2019s widow, Jiang Qing, and a group of accomplices be publicly tried for masterminding the chaos. They were known as the \u201cGang of Four\u201d. Jiang contested the charges claiming she had merely been \u201cChairman Mao\u2019s dog\u201d but was sentenced to death in 1981, later reduced to life in prison. In 1991, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Cultural Revolution, she hung herself.     Reporting of the \u2018Gang of Four\u2019 trial.   How did the Cultural Revolution affect China? Mao had hoped his revolutionary movement would turn China into a beacon of communism. But 50 years on many believe it had the opposite effect, paving the way for China\u2019s embrace of capitalism in the 1980s and its subsequent economic boom. \u201cA common verdict is: no Cultural Revolution, no economic reform,\u201d Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals write in their book on the period, Mao\u2019s Last Revolution. \u201cThe Cultural Revolution was so great a disaster that it provoked an even more profound cultural revolution, precisely the one that Mao intended to forestall.\u201d Another enduring legacy, experts say, is the obsession of today\u2019s rulers with stability and political control. Leaders such as Xi Jinping, a 13-year-old Beijing schoolboy when the cultural revolution began, had a front row seat to the mayhem, and some even partook in the violence. \u201cThey saw a China that was totally chaotic for about two years and they saw atrocities sometimes,\u201d says Walder, a Stanford University expert on the period. \u201cThey view the loss of the party\u2019s control as something that will lead to chaos.\u201d Dik\u00f6tter believes the nightmarish upheaval also served to destroy any remaining faith the Chinese people had in their Great Teacher. \u201cEven before Mao died, people buried Maoism.\u201d How is the Cultural Revolution remembered today? After Mao\u2019s death, the Communist party made some attempts to confront the horrors of the previous decade. Some were punished for the violence while those unfairly purged or persecuted were rehabilitated. But those efforts petered out in the early 1980s as Beijing became wary of implicating itself in the killing at a time of growing opposition from Chinese youth. Academics were discouraged from digging into the party\u2019s inconvenient truth. Experts say Beijing would seek to mark this year\u2019s 50th anniversary with deafening silence. \u201cThey won\u2019t go there - it is just too damaging to the party,\u201d says MacFarquhar. \u201cThe party is guilty of three massive blows to the Chinese people: the [Great] Famine, the Cultural Revolution and the destruction of the environment which is ongoing now and may in fact be more deadly that the other two in the long run. And the last thing it wants to say is that we were the guilty ones.\u201dHowever, a bitter public row over a Mao-themed extravaganza held in Beijing earlier this month has unexpectedly thrust the decade-long upheaval back into the headlines.  What should I read to understand the Cultural Revolution? The seminal work on the period is Mao\u2019s Last Revolution by Roderick MacFaquhuar and Michael Schoenhals, a blow-by-blow account of the turmoil. An earlier book by Schoenhals - China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, 1966-69: Not a Dinner Party - contains a trove of documents, speeches and photographs, that chronicle the country\u2019s descent into anarchy. Perhaps the most withering critique of the political mobilisation can be found in The Chairman\u2019s New Clothes: Mao and the Cultural Revolution, by Belgian scholar Pierre Ryckmans. Ji Xianlin\u2019s The Cowshed: Memories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a harrowing first-person account of the period. First published in 1998 and recently translated into English, the book recounts the hardship of a Peking University academic who spent nearly nine months as a prisoner of the Red Guards.Another powerful Cultural Revolution memoir is Life and Death in Shanghai by Nien Cheng, a Chinese graduate of the London School of Economics whose life was turned upside down by the Red Guards in 1967.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-11T02:04:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/manchester-united-luke-shaw-return-stronger-ruled-out", "sentences": ["They play Borussia Dortmund at the Shanghai Stadium on 22 July and Manchester City at the Beijing National Stadium two days later."], "title": "Manchester United\u2019s Luke Shaw sure of returning stronger than ever", "article": "Luke Shaw is confident of returning stronger than ever next season, after being ruled out of Manchester United\u2019s final two games because of a broken leg.

That is one of the conclusions made in The Future of Rugby, a report commissioned by HSBC to look at the difference that sevens, the short form of the game that will be used in the Olympics, will have in the next decade. The forecast is not quite for it to emulate T20 in cricket but become a major summer event here and, globally, expand the sport in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s rugby. \u201cIf the money in the sport is still predominantly associated with the 10 unions that compete at fifteens in the Six Nations in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the southern hemisphere, and global investment driven by the four-yearly Rugby World Cup, the breadth of participation, by region and by gender, is now associated with sevens,\u201d the report begins. \u201cRio 2016 is but the latest milestone in a development process that has taken the sport beyond its traditional heartlands to new countries and new markets. Key to this transformation has been the short-form game, rugby sevens. It is sevens that will be played at the Olympics; it is sevens that will help raise the profile of the game on the world stage this year.\u201d   Related: Maro Itoje: \u2018Disappointments sharpen the desire \u2013 Saracens want to go all the way this year\u2019    The report estimates that since rugby union\u2019s return to the Olympics was announced in 2009, \u00a320m has been invested in the sport by national Olympic committees. \u201cWhile the initial benefits are likely to be seen in the development and participation of the sport rather than in spectator numbers \u2013 Olympic audiences are huge, but interest in fringe sports tends to be confined to the countries that play them already \u2013 there is no doubt that the Olympics will transform the image of rugby. Countries will start to take the sport more seriously \u2013 and funding and government support will increase. We\u2019re already seeing evidence of this. After the Olympic decision was taken, China put together a full-time professional women\u2019s sevens team.\u201d Octavian Morariu, the president of Rugby Europe, the governing body that represents the tier-two and -three nations on the continent, believes that the winds of change blowing through the 15-a-side game after the World Cup will receive an extra gust after the Olympics. \u201cWhat is important for the game is that we show that its growth is not just confined to sevens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was rugby that became an Olympic sport, not sevens, and we have to use the extra interest that the Rio Olympics will being to help make the whole game more universal. Bernard Lapasset, who is standing down as the chairman of World Rugby, has had that vision and I am sure that his successor, Bill Beaumont, will carry that on. I do not see him arguing for the status quo. \u201cWe have a huge chance, starting with Rio. People will discover rugby through the Games and the sport can leave a mark on their minds. The players will see what being global really means, part of an Olympic Village with more than 200 countries. We know we have a long way to go and it is challenging, but we have two shots to establish rugby as an Olympic sport. We can prove our sport is dynamic and has great supporters. We can show are values are Olympic ones. We must take this chance.\u201d The HSBC report points out that the rugby world has expanded through sevens with countries like the United States, Kenya and Brazil embracing it, in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games, while China, South Korea and Kazakhstan have won medals at regional events: \u201cWhile the tier system will still be in place to support the development of fifteens teams in 2026, it will be less useful as a guide to sevens performance. Countries such as China or Brazil, which use the Olympic opportunity to drive funding into the game, will be competitive in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s sevens. Expect to see the Sevens Series follow the game to these new growth hotspots, with venues in cities such as Shanghai and Rio.\u201d The report sees a domestic spin-off from the Olympics. The Australian Rugby Union, ever mindful of new financial streams, has been looking at whether it could use sevens to boost the sport in the way the Big Bash there has led to bigger cricket crowds. \u201cThis might involve sports franchises; in the UK, the teams might be associated with the English Premiership and the Pro12 clubs. In turn, this will increase knowledge of the sport among people who might not have the opportunity to go to a World Rugby Sevens Series event, and create new national media exposure, coupled with broadcast and scheduling innovation [in the same way that coverage of T20 cricket has been transformed].\u201d   Related: Olympic Games: Team GB call up 25 players for Sevens training squad    And then there are the players. The report expects their number to more than double from 7m today to 15m by 2026 with most of the new ones coming into the sport through sevens. The former England full-back Jason Robinson, who joined union from league, believes that players in the 13-a-side game who make the switch in future will be tempted by sevens. \u201cThe skills required are a much better match,\u201d he said. \u201cSevens is much less technical, less crowded and more reliant on the speed and handling skills that rugby league promotes. Rugby league players are taught not just to tackle the man, but also to wrap up the ball. That\u2019s something that\u2019s important in rugby sevens when winning possession of is critical. As the money grows in sevens, rugby league stars who make the crossover will go there rather than fifteens.\u201d Sevens is also less attritional than the full version at a time when player welfare is a major issue, but it has yet to really take off commercially and will not tempt the big names in the 15-a-side game because they would face a significant drop in income. HSBC reckons that will change, not least because of the reach of social media. \u201cBy 2026, sports media will be live or be on digital social platforms, or both,\u201d the report adds. \u201cWebsites will be largely redundant, except as reference sources. Sports content will mostly be hosted on and consumed through social platforms, whose owners will represent important opportunities for partnerships, revenues and brand development. For younger audiences, live content will also increasingly be watched via devices rather than on television. Expect to see the development of a sevens-based e-gaming community, which will also be a space through which sevens stars emerge. \u201cAs sevens grows in visibility and reputation, it will start to drive revenues in its own right, from attendances and media and sponsorship sales. This will be enhanced by the development of national sevens series leagues, and by the emergence of sevens as a summer sport in its own right. This will involve a greater focus on the athleticism and power of the game, and on the competitive nature of the matches and the teams. One effect will be that we\u2019ll start to see sevens players emerge as stars in their own right.\u201d \u2022 This is an extract taken from The Breakdown, the Guardian\u2019s weekly rugby union email.

I will be pushing to the absolute limit on the track and will give my answers there.\u201d Despite his podium success in the chaotic race in Shanghai, Red Bull have been disappointed by the performances of Kvyat, who only came into the team last season after a year at Toro Rosso following his GP3 title win in 2013. Essentially, Red Bull wanted to fast-track Verstappen into their top team and Kvyat\u2019s faltering form gave them the opportunity to do this sooner than expected. There was also a concern regarding Verstappen\u2019s three-year contract expiring at the end of 2017 \u2013 Ferrari and Mercedes have both shown interest in signing the driver, who looks destined to become the next big thing in the sport. Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, said: \u201cMake no mistake, Max is one of the hottest properties in Formula One. People said it was too early for Max when he got his debut at 16 but he is now one of the most exciting things in the sport. \u201cWe are privy to a lot of information going back to the start of testing and Daniil has been struggling for form against his team-mate. The race in Russia [in which Kvyat crashed into the Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel] was a catalyst but a lot more consideration went into it than one Sunday afternoon.\u201d Horner also revealed Red Bull had signed a fresh deal with Verstappen which would tie him to the team for the next few years. \u201cThis kills off the driver market as far as Red Bull is concerned,\u201d he said.

I\u2019m racing for a top team now and that is always what I wanted to do. The team have given me a lot of confidence and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.

Soon you'll be reaching for the scalp yoghurt", "article": "The next time dandruff dots your shoulders, you might want to reach for yogurt, not shampoo. The latest study into scaly scalps has found that nurturing particular bacteria on the skin could keep the white flakes at bay. Researchers in Shanghai took on the dandruff problem with an unprecedented investigation into flaky scalps and the ecosystem of microbes that set up home on the human head, feeding on the lavish menu of dead skin and oily secretions called sebum. Menghui Zhang at Shanghai Jiao Tong University invited 59 people aged 18 to 60 years old into the lab and gathered dandruff from eight different areas on their heads. All had washed their hair two days before turning up at the centre. Zhang separated the volunteers into \u201chealthy\u201d and dandruff groups, depending on the amount of visible skin flakes in their hair. He then looked to see how the populations of scalp bacteria and fungi differed between the two groups, and with individual\u2019s sex, age and physiology. The researchers found that sebum secretions rose through the teenage years, peaked at 15 to 35 years old, and then declined as people got older. Meanwhile, dandruff became worse as people aged, with the over 40s having more severe dandruff than the younger participants. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the authors note: \u201cSebum is an important food source for the growth of fungi and bacteria.\u201d   Related: Bald truth: hair loss down to genes controlling follicle creation, study finds    In previous work, scientists had identified a group of fungi called Malassezia as potential culprits in causing dandruff. The yeast eat fatty substances in sebum and produce oleic acid, which irritates the skin and may cause the scalp to flake. But in the latest study, Zhang found Malassezia fungi on the heads of people without dandruff, suggesting flaky skin might be made in other ways. He found that instead of fungi, the most important factor seemed to be bacteria. The two most common bacteria living on the scalp were Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus. In the \u201chealthy\u201d group with little or no dandruff, Propionibacterium made up 71% of the scalp bacteria, with Staphylococcus accounting for only 26%. But in the dandruff group, he noticed the populations had shifted dramatically, with Propionibacterium falling to 50%, and Staphylococcus rising to 44%. The two types of bugs can restrict each other\u2019s growth, and Zhang suspects that when Staphylococcus gets the upper hand, more dandruff is the result. Scalp sebum, he said, may be a particularly good food source for Propionibacterium, while moisture released from the skin helped the bugs grow. \u201cWe found that keeping the balance of the microenvironment is very important,\u201d Zhang said. All of which points to bug management as the new way of controlling dandruff. \u201cAdjusting the balance of the bacteria on the scalp, particularly by enhancing Propionibacterium and suppressing Staphylococcus, might be a potential solution to lessen dandruff,\u201d Zhang writes in the journal. How the community of scalp bugs can best be shaped to prevent dandruff is a question Zhang is now investigating, with a view to making better anti-dandruff shampoos. One approach could be to nurture Propionibacterium at the expense of Staphylococcus, by delivering nutrients to the scalp that benefit Propionibacterium more than its microbial rivals.  But another answer may lie in yogurts that contain Propionibacterium. In 2013, researchers in the US developed a yogurt laced with the bugs to help protect the skin from a hospital superbug, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Terry and his agent, Paul Nicholls, had gone into talks with the director, Marina Granovskaia, and the chairman, Bruce Buck, on Wednesday fully expecting to be told he would not be retained beyond the expiry of his current contract on 30 June. Instead, and much to their surprise, he was offered another 12-month deal, the terms of which have not been made public, and the opportunity to make clear his intentions before Sunday\u2019s final Premier League game against the newly crowned champions, Leicester City. The 35-year-old, who has made 703 appearances for the club he joined at 14, will be unavailable for that occasion as he serves the second match of a two-game ban but will take part in the team\u2019s post-match lap of appreciation. Supporters had intended to champion their captain\u2019s cause on Sunday, frustrated that, like them, the player was unaware as to whether the game was to be his farewell. Now, though, Chelsea have put the ball back in Terry\u2019s court regarding his immediate future with a proposal on the table, apparently sanctioned by the incoming head coach, Antonio Conte, and under consideration.   Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend    The player himself took to social media to suggest the offer would see him adopt \u201ca different role\u201d, though that is thought to involve accepting a diminished status within the team in terms of playing time and, potentially, his weekly wage \u2013 he currently earns over \u00a3100,000 a week \u2013 rather than relinquishing the captaincy or adoption of a coaching role. \u201cThanks to everyone for the kind wishes,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe contract extension the club has offered me is a different role and I hope everyone will understand I want to take the time to consider it carefully before making a decision.\u201d The defender is due to resume studies for his Uefa B coaching course next week but has already stated that he still aspires to play for \u201ctwo more years\u201d. Any deal proposed by Chelsea was always likely to be heavily incentivised with appearance-related add-ons, for all that the club have privately maintained they would not expect him to sign radically reduced terms to remain. Regardless, the surprise decision to put forward an offer has now, in effect, left Terry confronting an unanticipated dilemma. Clubs in the Chinese Super League are prepared to offer him a 24-month deal, worth up to \u00a320m, with both Shanghai SIPG, currently coached by Sven Goran Eriksson, and Jiangsu Suning having been credited with an interest in securing his services. The player has undertaken a number of personal tours of China in recent times, aimed at raising his profile in the country, and even attended coaching clinics in Shanghai in March. While it is unusual for Chelsea to go public with a contract offer before an agreement has been reached with the player concerned, the hierarchy point to this being an exceptional case given Terry\u2019s standing at Stamford Bridge. It is understood both Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, two high-profile players eventually released under freedom of contract over recent years, were made offers to stay though neither was revealed publicly. As it transpired, both chose to pursue their careers elsewhere, at New York City and AS Roma respectively. The club appear to have taken the initiative and preferred not to take questions on the issue on Friday, though the interim manager Guus Hiddink, with Buck sitting at the back of the room at Cobham, did address the matter while not referring specifically to Terry. \u201cI think once the two are talking to each other regarding the near future it is a good signal for everyone, (and for those) in the stands as well,\u201d said Hiddink, whose second spell at the club in an interim capacity ends on Sunday. \u201cNature does \u2018do its work\u2019, but the man (to whom you are referring) is still rather fit. \u201cTalk to him and he says he was never the fastest, but he was always arriving in time. It\u2019s not about age. He is mentally strong, and also good for the younger people. Let\u2019s say the academy boys. Very good. To inspire them.\u201d Chelsea paid tribute to Terry at their annual player of the year awards dinner on Friday night, marking his achievement in becoming the third player to represent the club 700 times, with the captain moved to tears. There is a party scheduled for Under the Bridge nightclub at the stadium on Sunday evening. He has also hired the pitch on Monday for a private function, with the club waiving the customary \u00a322,000 fee for such an event.

Then he puts his index finger and thumb together in the universal sign for \u201cyou\u2019re so cool\u201d. He\u2019s right, I think. I do look pretty cool, sat nonchalantly on the back of a vintage motorbike in Marrakech\u2019s rush hour, to a soundtrack of beeping, rumbling truck engines and the distant call of a muezzin. Then the gendarme lifts his arm, the traffic roars and I have to cling on (less nonchalantly), while we leave the old man and his pick-up for dust. Of course, it\u2019s what I\u2019m sitting on that\u2019s cool. Not me. I\u2019m on a tour with Insiders Experience, which has just begun offering motorbike city tours in Morocco. The company started in Shanghai in 2008 when French founder Thomas Chabrieres opened a business that combined his love of vintage sidecars and travelling. His passion resulted in the purchase of a number of Urals (a Russian copy of a 1930s BMW design) and some imaginative rebranding of these rugged pieces of Soviet history into suitable sightseeing vehicles.     Passengers can sit on the back of the bike or hop in a sidecar    As a passenger, you can choose to sit on the back \u2013 which may feel a bit intimate for those who prefer not to touch thighs with their tour guides \u2013 or you can hop in a sidecar. I can\u2019t help but feel that this option, which puts the rider at the exact level of bus exhaust pipes, might mar the novelty factor but it would be prissy to whimper about lungfuls of CO2. A wind-in-the-hair, dirt-in-the face romp is what you\u2019re signing up for. The blurb on the website talks about majestic landscapes and fabled history, which sounds rather formulaic, just the reason I\u2019m not normally a fan of organised tours \u2013 too ordered, too unadventurous. But then I meet Felix.     Motorbiking around the city.    \u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d he asks, in a strong Irish accent. All of the tours are tailor-made, so we discuss what I\u2019d like to see and when I need to be back (in time for gin at Riad El Fenn, a characterful hotel in the heart of the medina). I\u2019ve already spent plenty of time (and money) in the old town, so Felix decides on a route that will take in bits of the city I haven\u2019t seen and we roar off northwards. We cruise by the Catholic L\u2019Eglise Des Saints Martyrs, the first church to be built in Marrakech. Felix points out the striking pink mosque opposite it, two buildings often cited as an example of the city\u2019s religious tolerance. In some ways the area, Gu\u00e9liz, is unremarkable \u2013 smart houses, wide streets and kids on their way home from school. But it\u2019s also an area emerging as an artistic hub and we rumble past spots such as 127, which, in 2006, became the first photo gallery ever to open in the Maghreb. Felix weaves through the traffic and we negotiate one of the wider entries to an outer, less-visited part of the souk. I constantly expect him to shout \u201chang on\u201d, or something that might indicate a concern for my welfare as we round a blind corner. But he does no such thing. \u201cWe are really highly trained,\u201d he reassures me later. \u201cSometimes I won\u2019t talk because I\u2019m concentrating,\u201d but generally, as the average speed is only 20kmh, \u201cwe answer emails faster than we drive motorbikes.\u201d     View over the nearby Atlas mountains. Photograph: Felix Mathivet    Soon we are beyond the hubbub, zooming past the city walls and into the Palmeraie, a now-protected neighbourhood where centuries of palm cultivation provided the city with food, raw materials and greenery. You could stop at the ancient underground irrigation systems that brought the area to life, but instead we pull up at the lovely Addi Ou Addi, the oldest villa in the area. It has vibrant zellige floor tiling, ornately carved wooden walls and the original 1927 furniture. It\u2019s not open to the public and is one of several places that Chabrieres\u2019 wide network makes accessible. Next, we head offroad through the groves that give the Palmeraie area its name. Expanses of pink-tinged sand are dotted with palm trees whose roots are protected from the elements (and wandering goats) by mounds of compacted sand. It\u2019s a picturesque spot for a picnic and a drink \u2013 with the sun setting, and kicking up a cloud of rosy tangerine dust as we go, only sunglasses and a billowing head scarf could make it more cinematic. Afterwards, petrolhead friends ask me unanswerable questions about the motorbike; Moroccophiles wonder whether you see anything differently from the bike. Of course, the city\u2019s sights don\u2019t change but Insiders\u2019 take on it is a new one for me. Marrakech isn\u2019t the most accessible city \u2013 cycling is hard work and the abrupt ending of pavements makes it less walkable than some cities. The motorbike\u2019s agility allows access to things you wouldn\u2019t otherwise see. But also, just being along for the ride makes you feel good \u2013 wind-blown, grubby, and with a face aching from smiling in response to all those beeps, stares and waves.\u2022 The trip was provided by Insiders Experience.

Russell Knox should be a part of golf\u2019s wider consciousness on account of his success at last year\u2019s WGC event in Shanghai. An appearance at a Thursday evening dinner at Sawgrass, as hosted by Darren Clarke, endorsed the Scot\u2019s status as part of the Hazeltine Ryder Cup equation.   Related: Russell Knox pulls off Shanghai surprise with fairytale WGC-HSBC Champions win    Knox\u2019s historic family connection to Jacksonville, which is now his home, means that the Players Championship has featured in his thoughts since he harboured dreams of playing professional golf. When developing as a junior at Nairn Dunbar and subsequently Inverness golf clubs in the Scottish Highlands, the Stadium Course at Sawgrass was as much as an inspiration to Knox as major championships. It seems fitting then that this venue played host to the scene which won the understated Knox so many new fans. The true character of sportsmen is frequently displayed in adversity or trauma. Knox suffered the latter in the dying embers of his third round at the Players but reacted in a manner which was class personified. The public duly embraced him. The taking of nine shots anywhere would be painful enough for a professional golfer. To do it, as Knox did, at such an iconic hole as the par-three 17th here offered a fresh level of attention. Add in the proximity of friends and family, plus the fact that at eight under par Knox was a serious part of this tournament narrative, and he would be forgiven for wanting to follow his three balls into a lake which provides a home for alligators. Instead, when pitching his seventh shot on to the green, Knox punched the air and laughed. A scene which could have precipitated gasps and unrelenting sympathy from galleries instantly became cause to afford lavish praise upon the 30-year-old. When holing out for nine, Knox again celebrated. By Sunday morning, the United States broadcast media were replaying the incident time and again; not as a dig at Knox but in celebration of his attitude. The reaction to his own reaction has proved quite something. \u201cA lot of people were rooting for me here,\u201d Knox said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I mean, that was an epic fail. Until you\u2019re in that position, you don\u2019t understand what it feels like. I thought I hit a good first shot. I thought I\u2019d stuffed it. And then after that, it just goes so quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe how you feel. Your whole body is like ... I don\u2019t even know, where your blood is just pumping through your brain. I had never shanked a pitching wedge off a tee before, so that was a first. \u201cThe first one, I must have just hit it a groove high because I hit it pretty decent. It wasn\u2019t a total chunk. I was very shocked when it went in the water because I never once thought it was going to go in, and then obviously the second one; epic fail. After that, it\u2019s just difficult. You\u2019re so nervous. I mean, you\u2019ve got thousands of people laughing at you. It\u2019s a very uncomfortable feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s such an easy shot when you have no nerves or adrenaline. A pro would never miss that. We should know what we\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s a different story once you\u2019ve hit two in a row in the water. The green felt like it was the size of a quarter. \u201cI had no idea what I was going to make. I ended up made an awesome putt for that nine. After I was walking through the tunnel to the next tee, I was like: \u2018Whoa, that was to avoid a 10.\u2019\u201d There was no lingering damage.

That party had initially been considered as part of his farewell to the club he has called home since he was 14. The 35-year-old cancelled it on Sunday while he considers the offer of a 12-month deal. That proposal was made in talks between his agent, Paul Nicholls, the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, and the director, Marina Granovskaia, last Wednesday. It came as a surprise to Terry, who had long feared he would be denied a chance to take his senior Chelsea career into a 19th season. Terry indicated on Friday the proposal is for \u201ca different role\u201d at the club, effectively a reduced involvement in the team and a lower wage. He is now weighing that offer against more lucrative deals proposed by clubs in China. Shanghai, who are coached by the former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, and Jiangsu Suning are reported to be interested and would be able to offer two-year contracts worth about \u00a320m. Terry considers his future to be in coaching and will resume his Uefa B licence course next week but he is keen to play on for at least another two seasons.

Xia Jiantong, a 39-year-old millionaire from eastern China who uses the English name Tony Xia, was announced as Villa\u2019s owner on Wednesday \u2013 one month after the club dropped into the Championship following one of the most disastrous seasons in their 142\u2011year history. Speaking on Thursday afternoon at his office in Beijing\u2019s financial district, Xia said he was preparing to embark on an extensive revamp of the club in an effort to secure immediate promotion back to the Premier League. Once that was achieved he would fight to turn Aston Villa into a global force.   Related: Aston Villa agree sale of club to Chinese businessman Dr Tony Xia    \u201cMy ambition is to bring Villa to the top six in less than five years and I hope it can be [one of] the top three in the world \u2013 even the best well known in the world \u2013 in less than 10 years,\u201d Xia said in one of his first interviews since the deal became public. \u201cAt least [until] now what I have planned [in my career] everything has been achieved. Nobody believed in the beginning but I made it happen no matter how many years it took.\u201d Asked for his message to Villa fans, Xia said: \u201cForget the past and think we are going to enter into a new age.\u201d However, Aston Villa\u2019s new chairman admitted his immediate challenge would be fighting a way back to the top flight. \u201cThe first priority is to get promoted. I feel a lot of pressure. I think a lot of Villa fans are eager to get back up to the Premiership, so the next one year will be very tough for me. I hope we can do it.\u201d Xia also wants to find the best manager and confirmed he had held discussions with a number of candidates, including the former Chelsea and West Bromwich Albion manager Roberto Di Matteo and the former Southampton and Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson. \u201cWe have several very good candidates \u2026 I have talked to all of them,\u201d Xia said, adding the decision would be made in the next two weeks. \u201cThe most critical thing now is to get the right manager. [We] need a really good coach who knows how to play in the Championship. It\u2019s even harder than the Premiership. We need to figure out how to reorganise the team.\u201d The manager would be given transfer funds of between \u00a320m and \u00a350m, depending on how many players he believed were needed, Xia said. \u201cFor now, I am confident. I think we will add six to seven players in maybe six or seven positions [before the start of the season] and we are going to bring some young talented people from the academy to play in the first squad \u2026 I think a lot of them can play very well in the Championship.\u201d The businessman, who returned to China from England this week, said he hoped the devastated Villa fans would look to the future and throw their support behind his plans. He defended the highly unpopular Randy Lerner and said some of the abuse directed at him by fans was unfair.    Randy Lerner is a nice guy and does have a passion for this club. He really wanted to make the club much better    \u201cActually, he is a nice guy and he does have a passion for this club. He really wanted to make the club much better. He invested a lot of money.\u201d in an admission of the toxic relationship that developed between Lerner and supporters, the new Villa chairman recognised he would need to build a much better dialogue with fans than his predecessor. \u201cCommunication will be a very important part,\u201d he said. Having watched Villa\u2019s last home game, against Newcastle United on 7 May, Xia said he planned to become a well-known face at Villa Park and would move to Birmingham with his wife and 18-month-old daughter in an attempt to win over fans and help with the push for promotion. \u201cI am going to spend a lot of time there, especially in the first season,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think I will buy a house maybe in the next month.\u201d Xia was born in Quzhou, a mid-sized city about 400km south-west of Shanghai, to an agricultural technician father and a housewife mother. \u201cI grew up in a very normal family,\u201d he said \u2013 but according to reports in China\u2019s domestic media he was far from a normal child. They describe Xia, who was one of three children, as a child prodigy who left home to study at university in Beijing at the age of 14. Five years later, aged 19, Xia packed his bags and crossed the Pacific to spend six years studying at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also spent five months as an exchange student at Oxford University in 2002, during which time he said he hadbecame a Villa supporter after watching a game at Villa Park. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of the English football league for many years,\u201d he said. Asked about his first match at Villa Park, the entrepreneur said: \u201cYou know the feeling there. It\u2019s not like excitement, it is like a shock when you are in that environment.\u201d Xia said he made his fortune working on infrastructure projects across a rapidly urbanising China and had taken over Recon Group, the Beijing and Hangzhou-based holding company behind the purchase of Aston Villa, in 2004. Perhaps appropriately for the new owner of a crisis-hit football club, he said the company\u2019s name was an abbreviation of the word reconstruction. According to the Financial Times Recon Group has controlling stakes in companies that include a soap maker and a Shanghai-based company that produced 150,000 tonnes of the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) last year. That firm reportedly made a net loss of $77.7m last year. In an interview with Sky News, the former Villa midfielder Ian Taylor described Xia\u2019s takeover as \u201cgreat news\u201d but admitted he was \u201ca bit reserved about the qualifications of the new owner\u201d.

Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    Speaking on Thursday, Xia insisted he was the perfect man for the job. He described himself as a hard-working, self-made millionaire who would have little patience with overpaid players who were not pulling their weight. \u201cFor a lot of Chinese now, they think the only way you become rich or become successful is because you have grown up in a rich family or you have a whatever daddy \u2013 a rich daddy, a powerful daddy or whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you keep working hard you still have a chance. I think attitude is more important than talent. So that is one of the basic principles for me to give advice to the coach to choose players to revamp the team.\u201d Xia promised to inject significant funds into the club but said he would not attempt to copy what he called the \u201cmoney-burned\u201d model of teams such as Manchester City. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a healthy model and it can\u2019t last long,\u201d he said. Xia said he would return to Birmingham in the next fortnight in order to start rebuilding and engage with the fans. \u201cThey need to know I am one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI will do whatever I can to promote the club. I hope we can bring everything back on to the right track as soon as possible.\u201d The situation at Aston Villa \u201ccould not be worse,\u201d Xia said. \u201cSo I hope all the Villa fans can really stand up together. I hope after one year we will be happy.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao How Chinese are investing in European game Chinese investors have invested more than \u00a3460m over the last 14 months, including Aston Villa\u2019s sale of 100% ownership to the Beijing based Recon Group, owned by Tony Jiantong Xia. Members of the second largest economy in the world have acquired stakes of football clubs in England, Spain, France, Czech Republic and the Netherlands. China, whose national team have only qualified for a World Cup once \u2013 in 2002 \u2013 is potentially looking to open doors for Chinese players appearing in first teams of elite European football clubs by obtaining stakes. ADO Den Haag The Beijing-based Chinese businessman Wang Hui, a football enthusiast who has taken part in training sessions, bought 98% of the club for \u00a35m at the start of 2015 and promised to take ADO into Europe. At the beginning of this year, after Wang failed to meet deadlines for further investments, the Dutch football association announced it could put ADO into administration. Speaking to the New York Times, Wang partly blamed cultural differences for the tensions and finally provided the money in April. ADO finished 11th this season, two places higher than in the previous campaign. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Wang Jianlin, chairman of the Dalian Wanda Property Group and one of China\u2019s richest men, bought 20% of the Spanish club\u2019s shares for \u00a334m in January 2015. Atl\u00e9tico purchased the Colombian striker Jackson Mart\u00ednez for \u00a328m that summer and sold him to the Chinese Super League club Guangzhou Evergrande for \u00a332m in February. Atl\u00e9tico have finished third in La Liga for a second straight season and have reached the Champions League final.   Related: Aston Villa\u2019s Randy Lerner says blame for relegation rests solely with him    Espanyol In November 2015 the Hong Kong unit of China\u2019s Rastar Group purchased 56% of Espanyol\u2019s shares for about \u00a314m. Rastar said it would increase the investment by another \u20ac45m. Espanyol, 10th in La Liga last season, have finished 13th this year. Recent rumours suggest they want to sign the Manchester United goalkeeper V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s and the former Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli. Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard The Hong Kong-based lighting manufacturer Ledus acquired one of the oldest professional clubs in France, paying \u00a35m to the previous owners Peugeot in July 2015. Ledus says it is in it for the long term and wants to get the club promoted from Ligue 2. Sochaux were in the top division as recently as 2014 and won the French Cup in 2007 but they finished 15th this season and, to the fans\u2019 fury, were in danger of relegation. Ledus\u2019s owner has admitted he previously did not have any interest in football but saw a good opportunity for establishing the brand in Europe. Manchester City In December 2015 a Chinese consortium, CMC, bought a 13% stake in City for \u00a3265m. Its chairman, Ruigang Li, said: \u201cFootball is now at a fascinating and critical stage of development in China. We see unprecedented growth of opportunities in both its development as an industry, being China\u2019s most watched sport and its inspirational role bringing people of all ages together which share a passion.\u201d Slavia Prague China Energy Company Ltd paid an undisclosed sum for 60% of one of Czech football\u2019s most historic clubs in September 2015. Slavia were near financial collapse before the start of this season but, with the help of Chinese money, they managed to keep top players such as the Czech Republic international Milan Skoda and finished fifth.

He had qualified 12th, down among the also-rans in his first world championship grand prix. Just over two hours later, after averaging 120mph over 52 laps of a circuit laid out on fast, flat public roads cutting through cornfields outside Rheims, in temperatures approaching 40C, he flashed past the chequered flag to take victory by a tenth of a second from his nearest pursuer. At the wheel of a car loaned by Enzo Ferrari to a team formed with the aim of giving experience to young Italian drivers, he had beaten the superstars of the era, including Stirling Moss, Jack Brabham, Wolfgang von Trips, Dan Gurney, Graham Hill and Jim Clark.   Related: Max Verstappen becomes youngest F1 winner in history at Spanish Grand Prix    In its way it was the most remarkable result in the history of Formula One \u2013 until last Sunday, that is, when Max Verstappen became, at 18 years and 228 days, the youngest grand prix winner in the sport\u2019s history, just over a year after becoming F1\u2019s youngest ever driver when he was not even old enough to hold a driving licence in his native Holland. He has that licence now. He also has the distinction of being widely acclaimed as a certainty for greatness, and there are few reasons to challenge that prediction after the way the he took his Red Bull to victory at the Circuit de Catalunya last weekend. The Dutch teenager\u2019s first season with Toro Rosso \u2013 Red Bull\u2019s junior team, used for driver development \u2013 proved that he was quick, with an aggressive approach to overtaking that was probably already there when he first drove a go-kart at the age of three, having overcome the insistence of his father, Jos, a former grand prix driver, that he should wait until he was six. The boy\u2019s talent became obvious as soon as he started beating rivals several years older than him. He has been doing it ever since. On Sunday he came home a few metres ahead of a man who is exactly twice his age: Kimi Raikkonen, a former world champion and the winner of 20 grands prix. Verstappen didn\u2019t want to hang around when he was three, and the same is true today. In his approach to his career, he has shown the kind of ruthlessness that characterised the early progress of Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. And he has a powerful patron in the shape of Dr Helmut Marko, the former racer who runs Red Bull\u2019s young driver programme and was Vettel\u2019s mentor. Two weeks ago Marko brusquely demoted Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso in order to head off strong interest from other powerful teams, notably Ferrari, in Verstappen. The sudden promotion means that, despite a third place in Shanghai last month, the career of the 22-year-old Russian now comes under the heading of collateral damage. That\u2019s how it is in Formula One today. In Baghetti\u2019s time, regular fatalities ensured a constant replenishment of talent. During his six-year career, the funerals for top drivers included those of Von Trips, Lorenzo Bandini and Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, the Verstappen of his day, who was only 19 when he put his Ferrari on the front row at Monza in 1961 but perished a year later in Mexico City, in front of his home crowd. When one ace died, another took his place. In the last 20 years, only one driver has died in a grand prix. Former champions such as Raikkonen, Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso drive on into their mid-30s, while the young aspirants form an impatient line. By landing a seat in one of the handful of teams capable of winning races, Red Bull\u2019s new star has jumped a queue including such drivers as Stoffel Vandoorne, the highly rated 24-year- old Belgian who is currently McLaren\u2019s reserve driver, and Pascal Wehrlein, the 21-year-old German who, in the manner of a Chelsea starlet farmed out to Vitesse Arnhem, is currently on loan from Mercedes to the Manor team. Verstappen\u2019s approach is the 21st century\u2019s sharp-elbowed equivalent of Juan Manuel Fangio\u2019s instinct for moving from one team to another, sensing which would bring him success in any given season. At Rheims in 1961 Baghetti had good fortune when the three works-entered Ferraris, the odds-on favourites, all faltered. Luck was certainly on Verstappen\u2019s side in Spain, when Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton, also racing certainties to finish first and second for Mercedes, took each other out on the first lap. A difference between the Italian and the Dutchman is that at the end of his career Baghetti went quietly into retirement without having finished another race higher than fifth. By winning first time out, he had exceeded his limits. What is absolutely certain about Verstappen is that, barring misadventure, he will win many more races. If his speed and competitive spirit were already established, the last 22 laps of Sunday\u2019s race, which he spent fending off Raikkonen\u2019s assault while nursing a set of rapidly wearing tyres, also demonstrated his intelligence, his racecraft, and his sensitivity to the abstruse parameters that govern performance in modern F1. Tyres play too great a role in today\u2019s grand prix racing, but it was stirring to see a driver controlling, rather than being controlled by, the rate at which his rubber was being worn into uselessness. Afterwards he said that the last 10 laps had been like driving on ice, but he held off his Finnish pursuer \u2013 a master of racing on frozen lakes, as it happens \u2013 without a hint of anxiety. Formula One likes its dynasties. The Ascari, Hill, Villeneuve and Rosberg families all produced at least one world champion. The Verstappens look like being the next. But soon enough Formula One\u2019s latest race winner may be glancing in his rear-view mirrors and glimpsing Mick Schumacher, the son of his father\u2019s former team-mate, who is 17 years old and challenging for the Italian Formula Four Championship in a team with strong links to Ferrari. Next weekend Verstappen goes to Monaco, where a year ago he illustrated the contrast between his father\u2019s era and his own by walking away without a scratch after crashing head-on at high speed into the barrier at St-Devot\u00e9. In Jos\u2019s time, such an accident would have shortened his legs by a few inches. In Baghetti\u2019s time, it would have killed him. It\u2019s not hard to conclude that the ruthlessness of today\u2019s young grand prix drivers, on and off the track, is somehow connected to that crucial difference.", "tags": ["Formula One", "Red Bull", "Formula One 2016", "Motor sport", "Ferrari", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-05-20T12:47:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/22/recruitment-lessons-japan-australia-teachers-rural-schools", "sentences": ["Related: Busy teachers in England missing out on professional development    In Japan, Singapore and Shanghai, this learning happens through lesson study, where teachers of different expertise and experience plan lessons together, observe each other teach and have discussions about the effectiveness of the pedagogy observed."], "title": "Recruitment lessons: how Japan and Australia attract teachers into rural schools", "article": "I recently spotted new adverts on my Facebook feed asking me to help struggling schools. It\u2019s no surprise \u2013 I regularly post about teaching and education, and count being a teacher in my career history. The ad promotes the National Teaching Service, a new scheme to encourage the best teachers and middle leaders to move across the country and work in rural or underperforming schools that struggle to recruit and retain staff. This time, Facebook\u2019s marketing algorithm has missed its mark; I haven\u2019t been a teacher for three years. But my experience visiting and studying education systems in top-performing countries in the years since I was in the classroom allows me to shed light on how other systems work \u2013 and how this ambitious national programme might be best implemented. The challenge of getting qualified, quality teachers into schools that need them most is one many countries face. Australia, for example, has some significant geographical challenges. When we talk of rural schools in the UK, we refer to coastal or remote schools, two or three-hour\u2019s drive from the nearest city. In Australia, that is more likely to be a three-hour flight. How does the government convince their teachers to move into the outback?   Related: 10 professional development ideas for teachers    Australian states offer a number of incentives to encourage teachers into these remote schools. These can include: housing subsidies of 70-100%; retention benefits if they stay in rural schools beyond a certain number of years; vacation travel expenses; and an \u201cisolation from goods and services\u201d allowance. The UK\u2019s National Teaching Service is offering relocation subsidies of up to \u00a310,000, which is a great start, but other potentially persuasive benefits, such as allowances for travelling home and retention renumeration for staying beyond the three-year programme, aren\u2019t included. North of Australia, the Japanese government also offers benefits to mitigate being posted to schools that teachers have not chosen themselves, but their approach is much more structured. In Japan they have a system called tenkin, in which company and government employees are rotated to different offices (and sometimes roles) every few years. New teachers are posted to a new school after four years, and after that, teachers are rotated to a new school every six years. This allows for rich professional experiences, evens out teaching quality and revitalises the workforce within each school. Teachers are compensated with generous subsidies and given a formal introduction to the area, in addition to mentoring and professional development. Vitally, these opportunities are not reliant on individual schools. While England does not have a recruitment system in which teachers can be posted where they are needed, the National Teaching Service could offer an opportunity to start one. Like the Japanese system though, the professional development offered would need to be of a guaranteed, recognised standard \u2013 not reliant on the individual schools to which teachers were posted. Another important feature of the Japanese system is that while they do post great teachers to schools that need extra help, they also post teachers who need to improve to successful schools with strong teaching skills. This latter point is crucial. Just moving around good teachers isn\u2019t enough to make a significant impact on the system because the same amount of talent is just distributed in a different way. To have a significant and long-lasting impact on the teaching quality across the country you need to ensure that there are systems in place that support teachers to learn from one another.   Related: Busy teachers in England missing out on professional development    In Japan, Singapore and Shanghai, this learning happens through lesson study, where teachers of different expertise and experience plan lessons together, observe each other teach and have discussions about the effectiveness of the pedagogy observed. Teachers in Finland also have a weekly timetabled session to plan lessons with their colleagues, which allows them to learn from one another. The focus in all of these places is on supporting teachers.  National Teaching Service teachers must be given the time to plan professional development and engage other staff in conversations about pedagogy. Their impact could be so much greater if headteachers could make space for these conversations and observations throughout their school. Korea\u2019s system rotates teachers like Japan\u2019s does, but they also make the experience of working in disadvantaged schools count more when it comes to promotion than working in affluent areas. By making access to the highest rungs of their career ladder depend partly on whether they\u2019ve had experience in a more challenging area, they make the experience more sought-after. With a variety of career incentives, including guaranteed professional development and time for supporting others, the benefits of the National Teaching Service could convince more brilliant teachers to make the move to rural areas and challenging schools \u2013 and to stay there. And maybe if I return to the classroom, and work my socks off to become a brilliant teacher, I might click on that Facebook link after all.

The glitzy 50-storey tower that looms over London\u2019s Vauxhall and Pimlico is, as the Guardian revealed yesterday, just a stack of bank deposits. Once dubbed Prescott Tower, after the minister who approved it against all advice, it is virtually empty.   Related: Sadiq Khan condemns foreign investors' use of London homes as 'gold bricks'    At night, vulgar lighting more suited to a casino cannot conceal the fact that its interior is dark, owned by absent Russians, Nigerians and Chinese. It makes no more contribution to London than a gold bar in a bank vault, but is far more prominent, a great smudge of tainted wealth on the city\u2019s horizon. In 2003 London\u2019s first elected mayor, Ken Livingstone, was dazzled by a dinner invitation to the Villa Katoushka outside Cannes. His hosts were the titans of London\u2019s property world and he was reportedly soon in thrall to them. He said he would offer them \u201cthe potential to make very good profits\u201d in his new London. He especially wanted tall buildings; the taller the better. The developer Gerald Ronson lauded him for his remarkable \u201cvision\u201d. Tony Pidgley of Berkeley Homes called him \u201crefreshing\u201d. The mayor was as good as his word. He backed Ronson\u2019s monster Heron Tower in the City. He backed Prescott\u2019s Vauxhall tower. He backed the Bermondsey Shard. He even spent taxpayers\u2019 money on lawyers to support developers at public inquiries. At the time the Tory leader of Wandsworth, Eddie Lister, assailed Livingstone\u2019s obsession with towers as a \u201cone-man dictatorship\u201d. David Cameron\u2019s then cities spokesman, John Gummer, compared Livingstone to Mussolini, and spoke of the towers as \u201cthe vulgarity of bigness\u201d. Yet when Cameron came to power, this was all forgotten. In London, property is the most potent lobby. The Tory mayor, Boris Johnson, increased Livingstone\u2019s rate of tower approvals, while Lister gratefully took office as his tall-buildings champion.   Related: 'Tower for the toffs': UK's tallest skyscraper and playground of the rich    There was no published plan for the drastic surgery being inflicted on London\u2019s appearance. No limit was set to the towers\u2019 location or height. No one took care of their appearance or bulk, their civic significance or their role in the life of the capital. Some 80% of the approvals were for luxury flats, chiefly marketed as speculations in east Asia. Such has been the rate of unrestricted growth, there seems no reason to doubt the dystopian vision of London\u2019s future depicted in the last Star Trek movie. Johnson\u2019s current legacy to London is 54,000 luxury flats priced at over \u00a31m, about to hit a market that even before the present downturn needed just 4,000 a year. This bubble simply has to burst. The waste of building resources, energy and space, the sheer market-wrecking bad planning, beggars belief. Towers have a perfectly reputable place in the history of cities. By their nature they dominate. They mark victories and royal palaces; they signify civic centres and clustered downtowns. The tallest towers, in the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Singapore and China, reflect the priapic obsessions of dictators and the celebrity cravings of banana republics. Civilised cities such as Paris, Rome, Amsterdam \u2013 even New York, Boston and San Francisco \u2013 either ban new towers from historic areas or zone them into clusters. Above all they show some consideration for the aesthetics of place.    'They are the product of speculative flows of often 'dodgy' cash, seeking an unregulated property market    No such considerations applied to the Vauxhall tower. Some people like towers, though few want them everywhere. Architects love them as \u201cicons\u201d, as bankers love money. Some cities desperate for space, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, build high to cram in the poor, often in dire conditions. Studies from Jane Jacobs to Lynsey Hanley catalogue the impact of high living on family life and community cohesion. In London, as the Guardian shows, these buildings have nothing to do with housing supply, let alone low-cost supply. Their front doors are manned not by concierges, but by security guards, like banks. They are the product of speculative flows of often \u201cdodgy\u201d cash, seeking an unregulated property market that asks no questions and seeks a quick profit. That is all. Most cities, ironically including Hong Kong and Singapore, in some way restrict foreign or non-resident acquisition of property, as do most New York condominiums. In London gullible politicians and venal architects have conspired to suborn a great city, simply because towers seemed vaguely macho and money smells sweet. Nor do towers have to do with population density. The idea that modern cities must \u201cgo high\u201d as part of the densification cause is rubbish. External landscaping and internal servicing makes them costly and inefficient. The densest parts of London are the crowded and desirable low-rise terraces of Victorian Islington, Camden and Kensington. The recently proposed Paddington Pole, the height of the Shard, had just 330 flats on 72 storeys. Adjacent, Victorian Bayswater could supply 400 on the same plot. London has seen nothing yet. A row of giant blocks is about to rise around the Shell Centre behind the National Theatre. The 50-storey cucumber-shaped One Blackfriars is emerging on the bank of the Thames opposite the Embankment. It will intrude on views of the City far more than does the Shard. The line of the Thames will be marked by a series of jagged broken teeth. Prescott\u2019s tower at Vauxhall is to be joined by two more apartment stacks next door, one even higher. Next to Battersea power station is a crowded over-development on an almost Hong Kong scale, named Malaysia Square and aimed at the Asian super-rich. Johnson helped sell it in 2014 by actually unveiling the development not in London but in Kuala Lumpur. It will probably go bust and end up as slums. At least the poor may one day live there. Livingstone and Johnson promoted these towers not because they cared where ordinary Londoners would live, or because they had a coherent vision of how a historic city should look in the 21st century. They knew they were planning \u201cdead\u201d speculations, because plenty of people told them so. They went ahead because powerful men with money and a gift for flattery just asked. It was very British sort of corruption. The appearance of these structures on the London horizon must rank as the saddest episode in the city\u2019s recent history. We must live with them forever.

Born in south India in 1888 and educated in a monastery, Krishnamacharya learned hatha yoga (the branch of yoga philosophy concerned with physical poses) at a time when many religious Hindus and educated Indians looked down on it. The ash-covered mendicants contorting on the banks of rivers had roughly the same cultural capital as unwashed street buskers. The respectable aspects of yoga were those techniques that had to do with breath control, meditation and a philosophy that spoke of transcending worldly concerns. This changed in the 1920s, when global interest in physical fitness and nationalist sentiment in India combined to revive interest in hatha yoga. For patriotic Indians, yoga offered physical culture imbued with national pride. Jawaharlal Nehru practised his headstand while in prison in the 1930s. Revivalists such as Swami Kuvalayananda brought a scientific approach to analysis of yoga\u2019s benefits. It was in this spirit that the maharaja of Mysore appointed Krishnamacharya to open a yoga school at his palace in the mid-20s. There, the yogi developed and taught vinyasa yoga, which combined breath and movement. While some of the postures resembled those described in classical hatha yoga texts, the sequences he developed also included drills used by Indian wrestlers and lunges and twists from European gymnastics routines. Krishnamacharya\u2019s prize students were BKS Iyengar, who went on to become the most famous yoga teacher in the world, and K\u00a0Pattabhi Jois, who created ashtanga yoga. There was also another student, Indra Devi, less famous but perhaps more vital to the globalisation of yoga, or at least to creating much of the self-help mythology that surrounds the practice outside India today. So contends a new biography of Devi. As its author, Michelle Goldberg, writes, Krishnamacharya\u2019s yoga was a syncretism of several physical fitness trends from the time, \u201ca modern Indian art developed with the wider world\u201d. That his system later arrived in cities around the world presented as \u201cthe timeless wisdom of the east\u201d had a lot to do with Devi. Indra Devi was born Eugenia Peterson in Riga, Latvia in 1899, the daughter of a Russian aristocrat and a\u00a0Swedish banker. She first came across the word \u201cyoga\u201d in her early teens. This was in Moscow, in 1914, when the elites of Russia\u2019s silver age entertained a fascination with the esoteric. Aristocrats attended theosophical lectures and learned to chant \u201cOm\u201d from Georges Ivanovich Gurdjieff, the Greek-Armenian mystic who dressed in a silk bathrobe and turban and taught classes in \u201csacred movement\u201d. According to Goldberg, more than 800 occult books appeared in Russia between 1891 and 1918. Devi, browsing in the library of a friend of her mother\u2019s, discovered a book called Fourteen Lessons in Yogi Philosophy and Oriental Occultism. The author, \u201cYogi Ramacharaka\u201d, was in fact from Chicago \u2013 a man named William Walker Atkinson, a leader in the proto-self-help movement known as New Thought, and author of such titles as Thought Force in Business and Everyday Life. Peterson\u2019s family was displaced during the first world war and lost its fortune in the Russian revolution, but aristocratic charm was its own currency \u2013 one that would sustain her across several continents for the rest of her life. Her young adulthood took her through Kiev, St Petersburg and, after the fall of the white army, Weimar Berlin. She worked mainly as a cabaret actor, entertaining her interest in the esoteric on the side. Her first spiritual awakening happened while attending a gathering of theosophists in Ommen in the Netherlands in 1926. \u201cThey have a weakness for sandals,\u201d wrote one observer of the crowd gathered for the proto-hippie spiritual festival. There Devi saw Jiddu\u00a0Krishnamurti, the Indian guru groomed by theosophist leaders to be a \u201cworld teacher\u201d, whose words, writes Goldberg, \u201chad a pleasant vagueness that allowed his listeners to project all manner of profundity on to him\u201d. Devi was moved, became a vegetarian, and travelled to the headquarters of the theosophist movement in Adyar, India to join Krishnamurti\u2019s entourage. When Krishnamurti renounced theosophy and his own messianic status in 1929, his disciples were at a loss. Eugenia stayed in India. She adopted \u201cIndira Devi\u201d as a stage name during a brief stint as a Bollywood actor, then married a Czech diplomat. She began doing yoga a few years later, first in Kuvalayananda\u2019s ashram in Bombay and later with Krishnamacharya in Mysore, who took her on as his only female student. After a months-long apprenticeship, he encouraged her to spread his teachings to the world. Her first stop was Shanghai, where her husband was posted in 1939 and where she would teach yoga to assorted diplomats and foreigners for the duration of the Japanese occupation. But it was in California that she would find her real calling, as the first yoga teacher in Los Angeles, teaching a Hollywood elite that even in the 1940s and 1950s was introducing wellness trends to the rest of the country. It was after moving there in 1947 that Eugenia adopted Devi as her official name, a clever branding move at a time of growing fascination with Asian spiritual traditions. Her clients included Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo. She befriended Aldous and Maria Huxley. \u201cEverywhere in the\u00a0emerging new age culture was an assumed connection between health and salvation,\u201d Goldberg writes. \u201cYoga as it eventually came to be practised in the US elevates exercise into a sacrament, merging the contradictory quests for beauty and selflessness.\u201d Devi taught at Elizabeth Arden\u2019s Maine Chance spa and wrote a self-help bestseller called Forever Young, Forever Healthy, followed by another bestseller, Yoga for Americans, a six-week home course. Goldberg\u2019s chronicle of Devi\u2019s life is detailed, but sometimes lacks a broader analysis \u2013 Devi may have familiarised people in China, the US, Russia and South America with the idea of yoga, but her pedagogic influence is unclear in comparison with teachers such as Iyengar. The popular impact of her books is left similarly unexplored, and there is no comprehensive explanation for the current popularity of yoga around the world. Goldberg measures out Devi\u2019s biography in equal parts, despite some phases of her life being far more important than others. Later in life, she fell under the sway of Sai Baba, the Indian spiritual guru, becoming one of his major proselytisers in the US. Baba purported to perform unlikely miracles and was later accused of coercing dozens of young men into sex, but the number of his followers was estimated to be in the millions. What emerges, in the end, is a book less about yoga than the history of new age spirituality as told through a single 20th-century life. It\u2019s a history rife with charlatans and sexual predators, where yoga is only one example of new beliefs and practices catalysed by industrialisation, a globalised menu of religions, and the rise of physical wellness as a sacramental pursuit. Yoga in the 1920s, when Devi encountered it, was a modern exercise regimen with philosophical roots in classical texts that encouraged selflessness. \u201cThe fact that yoga is now seen as a route toward individual development and a more efficacious life in the world is thus a historical irony,\u201d Goldberg writes. On the other hand, \u201cthere\u2019s never been a pristine, eternal tradition to corrupt\u201d. Corruption, among those who peddle epiphany, comes in other forms. \u2022 Emily Witt\u2019s book Future Sex will be published by Faber in the autumn.

Today we use public transport, and it takes almost two hours. We use a jeepney (a cross between a jeep and a van), a bus, then two more jeepneys and a motorised tricycle. The city\u2019s 2.2 million vehicles frequently grind to a standstill, and it is not unusual for commuters to be stuck for for three to four hours. When torrential rains flood the city, it can be much worse. As the bus pulls onto EDSA, Manila\u2019s notorious main thoroughfare, the honking is almost constant, drivers ignore the road markings and pedestrians frequently walk in the road \u2013 pavements are often absent or very narrow. This is the city\u2019s most dangerous street, responsible for more traffic casualties than any other. In the last two decades 57,000 pedestrians have been hit in Metro Manila; 3.2% were fatalities.  Known as \u201ccarmageddon\u201d to locals, the traffic crisis in the Philippines\u2019 capital rose up the political agenda in the weeks ahead of the recent national elections. Six months ago, the city was named as having the \u201cworst traffic on Earth\u201d in a survey of 50 million drivers across 32 countries, conducted by the smartphone navigation app Waze. It has become a major economic issue, thought to cost the metro area 3bn pesos (\u00a345m) every day. In January, a senior adviser at the American Chamber of Commerce warned local media that, based on current trends, the city could become \u201cuninhabitable\u201d within four years.  In practice, Manila is not one city but 16, plus a municipality. Over the years they have conjoined to form Metro Manila, one of the most decentralised and heavily populated urban areas in the world, according to online journal site, Demographia (pdf). More than 22.9 million people are now packed into 1,632 sq km, a population density seven times greater than New York and 2.4 times greater than Shanghai.      Manila\u2019s major thoroughfares are extremely dangerous for pedestrians. Photograph: Jay Directo/AFP/Getty Images    In Manila, motor vehicles are thought to be responsible for around 80% of the air pollution, putting its inhabitants at heightened risk of stroke, heart disease, cancer and asthma. The traffic also brings a social cost. Karunungan, a 26-year-old young professional, no longer travels this route. Two months ago, she decided the traffic had got so bad she moved out of her family home, where she had lived free of rent, bills and grocery costs. Now she lives in a flat on her own, just 10 minutes walk from work. \u201cIt was accumulated anger and distress over time,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people are angry on the road. You can see it. You can feel it. There is a lot of road rage. It\u2019s so draining that when I get to the office I am already tired and I just want to rest.\u201d Others have it worse. Karen Juanson, 36, has started staying at a local hostel rather than going home at night. The Alliance Francaise where she studies is 16km from where she lives but the journey takes almost three hours.  \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting. You\u2019re not productive at all \u2013 stuck in stinking transport touching skin with someone who is as sweaty as you. How can you do anything?\u201d It takes the man next to me in the jeepney, who wishes to remain unnamed, two hours to get home. \u201cThat\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he says, and shrugs his shoulders. \u201c[It\u2019s] average. But I hate it because I have three children. I always get home late. I never see them.\u201d      Traffic becomes a lot worse when Manila is hit by flooding. Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP    Now those in power are taking note. The presidential candidates were competing to make promises to ease Manila\u2019s traffic woes. In their final televised debate, now-president Rodrigo Duterte promised to increase the capacity of the train system, while Grace Po heralded road expansion and clearing projects and improved enforcement of road rules. Meanwhile Miriam Santiago, who had run for president three times, called for investment in infrastructure to take people out of the capital and stricter discipline on the roads. With a mind to this, in September former president Benigo Aquino handed control of traffic management on EDSA over to the national police force. In April the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) launched a flagship project to hold traffic violators to account by installing 400 CCTV cameras across the city, with plans for 400 more. Already their statistics show that the number of motorists being caught has doubled.  Corazon Jimenez, general manager at the MMDA, is not worried that the city will become uninhabitable by 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s an exaggeration. We\u2019ve been here for the last how many years. This is Metro Manila \u2026 By 2020 there will be a change in terms of infrastructure and how the economy progresses in Metro Manila. Each city is doing redevelopment.\u201d It is true that the former government has invested heavily in large scale infrastructure projects to ease Manila\u2019s traffic. Last year Aquino launched $8.42bn-worth of new schemes, including two railways and two major road projects, including the \u201cSkyway stage 3\u201d an elevated expressway that will connect those on the north and south of the city.  But according to the MMDA, there are already 2.2 million vehicles on Manila\u2019s roads. Last year, sales of cars and trucks soared by 23%. So will the new road projects be part of the problem or the solution?     Filipinos ride a rail rickshaw on train tracks in Taguig city, south of Manila. Photograph: Francis R. Malasig/EPA    \u201cIn my opinion the preference of the national government is to build more and more roads,\u201d says Cresencio Montalbo Jr, professor in the school of urban and regional planning at the University of the Philippines.  \u201cWe have said this is the wrong thing to do \u2013 for a while those roads will befree of congestion but eventually they will be full of cars. Building more roads encourages more people to buy more cars \u2026 The traffic condition in Metro Manila is prevailing and paralysing. The solution \u2013 and this is true globally for cities \u2013 is you need high quality public transport.\u201d  He is more hopeful about the 4.8bn pesos bus rapid transit system (BRT) the president approved in December. Part-funded by a loan from the World Bank, it will link Manila\u2019s city hall near the waterfront with Quezon city, the metropolis\u2019 largest, through a 12.3km segregated route.  \u201cIts cost effectiveness, rail-competitive passenger capacity, shorter construction time, possibility to absorb some of the existing public transport workers, and its potential to affect public transport reform are among the BRT\u2019s strengths,\u201d Montalbo in his recent report on the topic. Others believe that electrification is the way to incentivise commuters to leave cars at home. Freddie Tinga, former mayor of one of Metro Manila\u2019s cities, is one of a number of entrepreneurs who hopes it can transform the Philippines\u2019 most ubiquitous public vehicle of all \u2013 the jeepney.  An industry that emerged from adapted US army vehicles left abandoned from the second world war, Metro Manila\u2019s fleet of 75,000 jeepneys are impossible to miss. Many are emblazoned with religious or political slogans or the names of American basketball teams (a popular sport in the Philippines).      Barack Obama helped launch the Comet electric vehicles, known as \u2018e-jeepneys\u2019 in 2014. Photograph: White House Photo/Alamy Stock Photo    As dusk falls I jump onto a jeepney with neon disco lights that\u2019s blasting out a drum and bass remix of Madonna\u2019s \u201cI should be so lucky\u201d.  Passengers pay around eight pesos (12p) to sit on cramped parallel benches \u2013 or on each other\u2019s laps \u2013 and have no choice but to inhale the toxic black fumes that spew out of its efficient diesel engines and in through its open sides. The drivers receive no salary and so are incentivised to speed, work long hours and cram in as many passengers as possible.  Two years ago, with a little help from Barack Obama, Tinga launched Comet, a pilot fleet of 29 electric jeepneys. He believes the vehicles \u2013 better known as \u201ce-jeepneys\u201d \u2013 can fight the pollution and the worst practices of the traditional industry. They are part of a wider push for electric vehicles in the Philippines \u2013 there could be 1 million by 2020, according to the Electric Vehicles Association of the Philippines. Their members (not including Comet) currently run around 100 e-jeepneys in Metro Manila and 250 e-trikes.    Related: Beatings and bribes: the corruption behind Lagos's traffic jams    Their target has been given a boost by the government\u2019s commitment to phase out all jeepneys in the capital that are more than 15 years old by 2018. Tinga\u2019s e-jeepneys, among others, will replace the old vehicles so that they are not creating more congestion.  Comet\u2019s clean white e-jeepneys lack character but are spacious, quiet and use a prepay card system. Drivers are contracted, paid a salary and work fixed eight hour shifts. The company expects to be operationally profitable by June, after which it plans to implement fixed schedules, designated stops and an Uber-style booking app so customers can book rides in advance. As Karunungan\u2019s experience suggests, comfort will be key to the challenge that lies ahead for Manila.  \u201cIf we can give people a better ride they will leave their car at home,\u201d says Tinga. \u201cOutside it\u2019s an unorganised mess. We ride in jeepneys because we have no choice. We want to build an A-grade first world vehicle that\u2019s is good enough for a developing world country \u2013 in developing countries we\u2019re always forced to settle.

At Calabash in Jamaica \u2013 a festival that rivals Hay, Bath and Cheltenham \u2013 the action takes place on Treasure Beach under a tropical sun, in a profusion of Caribbean largesse. Calabash is free, in all senses, and especially for its audience which this weekend will number between 3,000 and 4,000. Festivalgoers have been making their way here from all over Jamaica, especially Kingston and Montego Bay, by bus, taxi, car and moped. Backpackers, beach bums, drifters and seraphic Rastafarians mingle with mystified tourists, film producers and government ministers in a littoral detonation of cultural excitement. This biennial Jamaican literary event has become so popular, indeed, that this latest audience, whose revels were due to end on Sunday night, will sign up for Calabash 2018 sight unseen, so addictive is the experience of sitting under canvas in the shade to listen to a parade of novelists, storytellers and poets from across the English speaking world. One of the first to turn up at Treasure Beach at the turn of the millennium was the young Marlon James, now renowned as the Booker prizewinning author of A Brief History of Seven Killings, a brilliant tour de force in the Jamaican dialect. On Sunday, James is the headline event at\u00a0Calabash, whose slogan for 2016 is \u201cFruition\u201d, expressed in patois, a homage to its hometown hero, as Fruu-ish-aan. The current Calabash lineup celebrates the prodigal variety of English language poetry and prose worldwide, including Nigeria\u2019s Chigozie Obioma, India\u2019s Tishani Doshi and New Zealand\u2019s Booker winner Eleanor Catton. But it is James who fills the limelight. Speaking exclusively to the Observer shortly before his appearance, he is affable but weary. The post-Booker year has been \u201cweird and wild\u201d, he says. After turning his back on Jamaica for its homophobia, and making a new life in the US (he teaches at a liberal arts college in St Paul, Minnesota), he\u2019s found himself returning here more regularly. \u201cThis is my third visit this year.\u201d His former battles have been won. \u201cYou can say that Jamaicans like success,\u201d he observes sardonically. Recent festivals have seen appearances by Zadie Smith, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, Junot Diaz, Michael Ondaatje and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Nobel laureates Wole Soyinka and Derek Walcott. Calabash veterans recall with awe the occasion that Walcott launched a rhetorical fusillade against local bete noire VS Naipaul. More laidback Calabash aficionados might recall Salman Rushdie\u2019s mastery of the ping-pong table.     Marlon James at Calabash this year. Photograph: Oliver Holdengraber    Calabash is part of a vogue for the exotic and the international. Ever since the Hay festival branched out overseas in Cartagena, Colombia, back in 2006, literary festivals have been going global, like the English language. The marriage of international literary stars with local audiences in sunny destinations has inspired an unprecedented surge in book tourism, from Jaipur and Shanghai to Byron Bay, Australia. With the export of festival UK, ambitious writers today might be advised to carry a pen and a passport. On closer examination, however, Calabash, some three hours west of Kingston, which burst into exuberant life last week, is as Jamaican as rum or Red Stripe, and every bit as intoxicating. Its signature theme is audience participation. The festival has pioneered \u201copen mic\u201d sessions between more formal readings at which would-be poets and storytellers can enjoy a moment in the spotlight. The co-founder of Calabash, Justine Henzell, comes from a white Jamaican family with deep roots in the national culture. In 1972, Perry Henzell, her late father, directed the Jamaican crime classic The Harder They Come, a film that, after its successful Jamaican release, clinched a remarkable international market and has been described as one of\u00a0the most important films from the Caribbean. Henzell, for whom promoting Jamaica runs in the family, is the voice of this festival. \u201cDoes anyone not come to Calabash?\u201d she exclaims when questioned about her audience. \u201cOnly this morning, we had a woman from Oslo who had landed at Montego Bay and asked the immigration authorities how to find us. They phoned for directions to Treasure Beach.\u201d A literary festival with words and music braided together (each day closes with a thunderous live concert), Calabash celebrates Jamaican cultural self-confidence with a free spirit. Henzell again: \u201cAt Calabash all my authors feel like rock stars, and the audience really trusts us to programme a great lineup. I\u2019m really proud of what we offer, showcasing Jamaica.\u201d The all-important \u201cfree\u201d aspect comes at a price. Henzell relies on corporate sponsorship and government grants, like festival administrators everywhere. Soft power has been seductive, and promoting Jamaican cultural identity has become progressively easier since the festival\u2019s founding in 2001. \u201cEverything here is about word of mouth. The world has now caught up with what we knew already,\u201d says Henzell.     Marlon James with festival co-founder Justine Henzell. Photograph: Collin Reid    Jamaica has sponsored many strange English literary rendezvous, and Calabash plugs into that tradition. Ever since Captain Wentworth breezed into the opening pages of Persuasion in 1817, to add a frisson of romantic excitement to Jane Austen\u2019s last novel, Jamaica has been adding the thrill of jeopardy to English literary life. In the 20th century, the island provided an exotic backdrop to several English classics, from A High Wind in Jamaica to Dr No and Wide Sargasso Sea. Books are one thing; literary life is something else that Jamaica has excelled in. The island has long played host to many English and American writers, for instance, Ian Fleming, and his contemporary No\u00ebl Coward, the young Truman Capote, William Styron, James Jones (From Here to Eternity) and even Winston Groom, author of Forrest Gump. Alex Haley is said to have written parts of his bestseller Roots near Jakes hotel, the Henzell family\u2019s romantic beachside retreat, which also sponsors the Calabash festival. After these postwar literary grandees, who played truant in the Jamaican sunshine alongside Hollywood stars such as Grace Kelly, Clark Gable and Bing Crosby, there came a new flowering of indigenous Caribbean literature, led by writers such as the novelists John Hearne (Voices Under the Window), Jean Rhys and Roger Mais, and poets such as Walcott and Kamau Brathwaite. Their work became subsumed into that now unfashionable genre known as \u201cCommonwealth writing\u201d. This post-colonial model, promoted as much from London and New York as from Kingston, had virtually no appeal to the next generation of poets and novelists who were coming of age in the years after the death of Bob Marley. When Calabash was set up in 2001, part of its inspiration was both to give a platform to the best international English-language writing available and also to show would-be Jamaican writers the example of poets and novelists working at the top of their craft \u2013 \u201cto hear the best of the best,\u201d says Henzell, \u201cand to be inspired by that.\u201d Fifteen years or so after his first visit, Marlon James is full of gratitude for Calabash, its writers\u2019 workshop, and open-mic sessions. It was through the festival that he got taken up by Kaylie Jones, daughter of James Jones, who edited James\u2019s first novel, John Crow\u2019s Devil. Calabash gave him his break, but he won\u2019t be settling back here any time soon (\u201cI have a really good paying job in America\u201d) and he still has plenty of attitude. \u201cJamaica does not support its writers like Trinidad,\u201d he says. \u201cThe literary life is not sustainable here. This remains a conservative culture.\u201d Talk of Trinidad inevitably brings up VS Naipaul, and he becomes reflective: \u201cNow there\u2019s a cautionary tale,\u201d he says.", "tags": ["Literary festivals", "Books", "Jamaica", "Americas", "World news", "Marlon James", "Fiction"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-04T20:48:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/04/man-v-machine-robots-artificial-intelligence-cook-write", "sentences": ["Josh Newlan, a California coder working in Shanghai, got bored with listening to endless conference calls, so he built some software to listen for him."], "title": "Man v machine: can computers cook, write and paint better than us?", "article": "One video, for me, changed everything. It\u2019s footage from the old Atari game Breakout, the one where you slide a paddle left and right along the bottom of the screen, trying to destroy bricks by bouncing a ball into them. You may have read about the player of the game: an algorithm developed by DeepMind, the British artificial intelligence company whose AlphaGo programme also beat one of the greatest ever Go players, Lee Sedol, earlier this year. Perhaps you expect a computer to be good at computer games? Once they know what to do, they certainly do it faster and more consistently than any human. DeepMind\u2019s Breakout player knew nothing, however. It was not programmed with instructions on how the game works; it wasn\u2019t even told how to use the controls. All it had was the image on the screen and the command to try to get as many points as possible. Watch the video. At first, the paddle lets the ball drop into oblivion, knowing no better. Eventually, just mucking about, it knocks the ball back, destroys a brick and gets a point, so it recognises this and does it more often. After two hours\u2019 practice, or about 300 games, it has become seriously good, better than you or I will ever be. Then, after about 600 games, things get spooky. The algorithm starts aiming at the same spot, over and over, in order to burrow through the bricks into the space behind. Once there, as any Breakout player knows, the ball will bounce around for a while, gathering free points. It\u2019s a good strategy that the computer came up with on its own. \u201cWhen our researchers saw this, that actually shocked them,\u201d DeepMind\u2019s CEO, Demis Hassabis, told an audience at a technology conference in Paris. You can watch his demonstration, too, and hear the laughter and applause when the machine figures out its burrowing strategy. The computer has become intelligent, a bit like us. \u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d is just about the oldest and most hyped of all computing\u2019s buzz phrases. The idea was first mooted seriously by Alan Turing in Computing Machinery And Intelligence, the 1950 paper in which he proposed what became known as the Turing test: if a machine could convince you through conversation that it was human, it was doing as much as any human could to prove it was truly thinking. But the term AI was not generally used until 1955, when American mathematician John McCarthy proposed a conference for experts. This took place the following year, and since then the field has run on a roughly two-decade cycle of mania and despair. (Researchers even have a new term \u2013 \u201cAI winter\u201d \u2013 to describe its spells out of fashion. The 1970s and 1990s were particularly harsh.)       Today there\u2019s a new mania, which looks different from the others: it fits in your pocket. A phone can beat the world chess champion, recognise songs on the radio and pictures of your children, and translate your voice into another language. The Nao robot pictured here with Yotam Ottolenghi can walk on two legs, speak, find a ball and even dance. (It\u2019s a robot, though, not AI: it can\u2019t design a menu.)           Could a robot do your job?    Hearing about the advances in AI, you don\u2019t need an expert to tell you to be excited, or scared. You just start to get the feeling: intelligence is here. Clearly Google got the feeling, too, because it bought DeepMind for a rumoured $650m. In 2013, Facebook launched its own project, with plans to develop facial and natural language recognition for the site. Developers have already begun work on intelligent chatbots, which Facebook users will be able to summon using its Messenger service. So far, computers haven\u2019t been \u201cintelligent\u201d at all, or only narrowly so. They\u2019ve been good at easy tasks that dazzle us, such as maths, but bad at those we take for granted, which turn out to be seriously hard. The act of walking is something modern robots learn like babies and still struggle with; basic pottering tasks remain distant dreams. \u201cOne example is the ease with which you or I could make a cup of tea in someone else\u2019s kitchen,\u201d says Professor Alan Winfield, a roboticist at the University of the West of England. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a robot on the planet that could do this.\u201d    There isn\u2019t a robot on the planet that could make a cup of tea in someone else\u2019s kitchen    To understand why being human is so difficult, think about how you might get a computer to recognise people from photographs. Without AI, you have to know how you do it yourself first, in order to program the computer. You have to collect and think about all the possible patterns, colours and shapes of faces, and how they change in the light and at different angles \u2013 and you have to know what is significant and what is just mud on the lens. With AI, you don\u2019t have to explain: you just give a mountain of real data to a computer and let it learn. How you design the learning software remains an esoteric matter, the province of a few sought-after computer scientists, but it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve got on to a winner by devising structures of data-processing based loosely on the structures in the brain. (This is called \u201cdeep learning\u201d.) As for the mountains of real data, well, that\u2019s what Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and all the rest happen to have lying around. At this stage, we don\u2019t yet know which uses of AI will turn out best. Josh Newlan, a California coder working in Shanghai, got bored with listening to endless conference calls, so he built some software to listen for him. Now, whenever Newlan\u2019s name is mentioned, his computer instantly sends him a transcript of the last half-minute, waits 15 seconds, then plays a recording of him saying, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t realise my microphone was on mute.\u201d Last year, Josh Browder, a British teenager, built a free artificial lawyer that appeals against parking tickets; he plans to build another to guide refugees through foreign legal systems. The possibilities are\u2026 Well, maybe an algorithm can count the possibilities. So will machine minds one day outstrip our own? The researchers I speak to are cautious, and take pains to emphasise what their machines can\u2019t do. But I decided to put AI to the test: can it plan a meal as well as Ottolenghi? Can it paint my portrait? Is technology still artificially intelligent \u2013 or is it starting to be intelligent, for real? The cooking test Well, I will say it isn\u2019t horrible. Humans have served me worse. Although in truth the name that IBM\u2019s Chef Watson gives this dish (\u201cChicken Liver Savoury Sauce\u201d) is about as appetising as it deserves. To be fair to Chef Watson, and to Guardian Weekend\u2019s own chef-columnist Yotam Ottolenghi, I had set them quite a task. I asked for a dish based on four ingredients that seemed to belong nowhere near each other: chicken livers, Greek yoghurt, wasabi and tequila. They could add whatever else they liked, but those four had to be in the finished dish, which I would cook and eat. Chef Watson didn\u2019t hesitate, instantly giving me two pasta sauces. Ottolenghi was more circumspect. \u201cWhen I got the challenge I thought, \u2018This is not going to work,\u2019\u201d he tells me. I thought the same. Or at least I thought I would end up eating two dishes that managed to be OK despite their ingredients, rather than because of them. In fact \u2013 and you\u2019ll think me a creep, but so what \u2013 Ottolenghi\u2019s recipe was a revelation: liver and onion and a tequila reduction, served with an apple, radish, beetroot and chicory slaw, with a wasabi and yoghurt dressing. The dish may make little sense on paper, but I devoured a plateful feeling that every element belonged. (And vinaigrette thickened with yoghurt and wasabi instead of mustard: seriously, give it a try.) Ottolenghi tells me the recipe is just a whisker short of publishable. The thing is, that dish took him and his team three days to perfect. They were able to taste and discuss flavours, textures, colours, temperatures, in a way that Watson can\u2019t \u2013 although there have been \u201cdiscussions\u201d about adding a feedback mechanism in future, Chef Watson\u2019s lead engineer, Florian Pinel, tells me. \u201cA recipe is such a complex thing,\u201d Ottolenghi says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me even to understand how a computer would approach it.\u201d     Yotam Ottolenghi and Chef Watson\u2019s dishes Photograph: Jay Brooks for the Guardian    Watson was first built by IBM to win the television gameshow Jeopardy! in 2011. In some ways it was a misleading challenge, because for a computer the tough part of a quiz is understanding the questions, not knowing the answers; for humans, it\u2019s the other way around. But Watson won, and its technology began to be applied elsewhere, including as a chef, generating new recipes based on 10,000 real examples taken from Bon App\u00e9tit magazine. First the software had to \u201cingest\u201d these recipes, as the Watson team put it. A lot of computation went into understanding what the ingredients were, how they were prepared, how long they were cooked for, in order to be able to explain how to use them in new dishes. (The process can still go awry. Even now Chef Watson recommends an ingredient called \u201cMollusk\u201d, which it helpfully explains is \u201cthe sixth full-length album by Ween\u201d.) A bigger problem was trying to give the machine a sense of taste. \u201cIt\u2019s easy enough for a computer to create a novel combination,\u201d Pinel says, \u201cbut how can it evaluate one?\u201d Watson was taught to consider each ingredient as a combination of specific flavour compounds \u2013 of which there are thousands \u2013 and then to combine ingredients that had compounds in common. (This principle, food pairing, is well established among humans.) Finally, the software generates step-by-step instructions that make sense to a human cook. The emphasis is on surprises rather than practical meal planning. \u201cChef Watson is really there to inspire you,\u201d Pinel explains. Each recipe comes with the reminder to \u201cuse your own creativity and judgment\u201d. And I need to. The first step is to \u201ctoast flat-leaf parsley\u201d, which just isn\u2019t a good idea. I am making, effectively, a slow-cooked spiced pork and beef ragu, including all my four ingredients, yet Watson oddly also includes cucumber and keeps telling me to \u201cseason with allspice\u201d, which I refuse to do on principle. In the end, I have a rich sauce with a flavour rather close to the farmyard, but not uneatable. I can\u2019t taste the wasabi or the tequila, which I\u2019m glad about.

Styling: Lee Flude    Watson is clever and the task is tough, but I am ready to say that this is no more than a bit of fun for food nerds, until Ottolenghi stops me. \u201cI think the idea of slow-cooking the livers with a bit of meat is great,\u201d he says. \u201cIt intensifies the flavour. Everything will come together. If I had to start afresh with this recipe, obviously the yoghurt doesn\u2019t fit \u2013 but I would leave the orange skin there, a few of the spices. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very bad recipe. It could work.\u201d Verdict Watson hides the weirdness of the ingredients, but Ottolenghi makes them sing. The writing test Put little Wordsmith next to the fearsome machines of IBM and Google, and it looks as computationally advanced as a pocket calculator. Yet while Watson fumbles through its apprenticeship, Wordsmith is already at work. If you read stock market reports from the Associated Press, or Yahoo\u2019s sports journalism, there is a good chance you\u2019ll think they were written by a person. Wordsmith is an artificial writer. Developed by a company in North Carolina called Automated Insights, it plucks the most interesting nuggets from a dataset and uses them to structure an article (or email, or product listing). When it comes across really big news, it uses more emotive language. It varies diction and syntax to make its work more readable. Even a clumsy robot chef can have its uses, but writing for human readers must be smooth. Hooked up to a voice-recognition device such as Amazon\u2019s Echo, Wordsmith can even respond to a spoken human question \u2013 about the performance of one\u2019s investments, say \u2013 with a thoughtfully spoken answer, announcing what\u2019s interesting first, and leaving out what isn\u2019t interesting at all. If you didn\u2019t know the trick, you\u2019d think Hal 9000 had arrived. The trick is this: Wordsmith does the part of writing that people don\u2019t realise is easy. Locky Stewart from Automated Insights gives me a tutorial. You write into Wordsmith a sentence such as, \u201cNew ABC figures show that the New York Inquirer\u2019s circulation rose 3% in April.\u201d Then you play around. The 3% has come from your data, so you select the word \u201crose\u201d and write a rule, known as a \u201cbranch\u201d, which will change the word \u201crose\u201d to the phrase \u201cshot up\u201d if the percentage is more than 5%. Then you branch \u201crose\u201d to become \u201cfell\u201d if the percentage is negative. If the percentage is -5% or lower, \u201crose\u201d becomes \u201cplummeted\u201d. Then you feed it synonyms. So \u201cplummeted\u201d can also be \u201cfell sharply by\u201d. \u201cThe Inquirer\u2019s circulation\u201d can be \u201ccirculation at the Inquirer\u201d. \u201cShot up\u201d can be \u201csoared\u201d and so on. Then you add more sentences, perhaps about online traffic, or about which days\u2019 print copies sold best, or about comparisons year-on-year. Then you get clever. You tell Wordsmith to put the sentences with the most newsworthy information first, defined perhaps as those that feature the greatest percentage changes. Maybe you add a branch to say that a result is \u201cthe best/worst performance among the quality titles\u201d. Hell, you can even teach it some old Fleet Street tricks, so that if circulation plummets the piece begins \u201cEditor Charles Kane is facing fierce criticism as\u201d, but if circulation has \u201cshot up\u201d this becomes \u201cCharles Kane has silenced critics with news that\u201d. Insert \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cagain\u201d or \u201ccontinues\u201d if you get the same thing two months in a row. \u201cThe artificial intelligence is actually the human intelligence that is building the network of logic,\u201d Stewart says, \u201cthe same network you would use when writing a story. It could have been developed 10 or 15 years ago, in code, but to make it work at this scale has only been possible lately.\u201d Clearly it takes longer to prepare an article on Wordsmith than to write one conventionally, but once you\u2019ve done so, the computer can publish a fresh newspaper circulation story every month, on every newspaper, within seconds of receiving the information. It can publish millions of stories in minutes \u2013 or publish only some of them, if the data doesn\u2019t reach a given threshold of newsworthiness. Thus it becomes an automated editor, too, with adjustable tastes in thoroughness, frequency and hysteria. For Wordsmith\u2019s task, I suggest football: it\u2019s a field that produces a lot of data and has a readership that wants personalised articles. Guardian football writer Jacob Steinberg volunteers to take on the computer, and I provide a table of facts from the recent Premier League: last season\u2019s league position and this season\u2019s position at Christmas and at the end, goals scored and conceded, top scorer\u2019s name and total, value of summer transfers and a quote from the manager. Working solely from this data, computer and human must each write a review of the season for a given club. Steinberg chooses Leicester City on the basis that its numbers should contain a story that anyone would see. Wordsmith doesn\u2019t need to choose. It will do all 20. And in fact both computer and human quickly produce quite similar work:           Both Steinberg and Wordsmith deliver dramatic first sentences. Perhaps keen to sound authentic, Automated Insights use some clever tricks to put feeling into the latter\u2019s article, astutely guessing that Leicester were \u201choping to finish in the top 10 after a 14th place finish last season\u201d. I look through Wordsmith\u2019s other articles and Southampton, having finished seventh last season, have \u201ceyes on a European spot\u201d, while Manchester City \u201cbegan the season dreaming of a league title after finishing second\u201d. Conversely, Steinberg digs more meaningfully into the numbers, showing that Jamie Vardy not only scored 24 goals, but that this was a higher percentage of his team\u2019s goals than was managed by all but two other players. Knowing how Wordsmith works, of course, one could easily set it up to do the same. In fact looking through it, Steinberg\u2019s entire article could have been created by a skilled Wordsmith programmer \u2013 with the exception of one line. \u201cIt\u2019s a magical season,\u201d he quotes the Leicester manager as saying, before adding, \u201cjustifiably so, given that a summer expenditure of \u00a326.7m on transfers made them the eighth lowest spenders\u201d. That \u201cjustifiably so\u201d shows a writer who actually understands what he is writing. Verdict Steinberg is a much better writer, unless you want 20 data-heavy articles in 10 minutes. The painting test A laptop wants me to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s in a good mood,\u201d Simon Colton says. He knows because he\u2019s the scientist who programmed it. We are in the Science Museum in London, where the Painting Fool, as it is called, is giving a public demonstration. It\u2019s important that I don\u2019t show my teeth, Colton says, because something about the light makes them look green to the Painting Fool. From my toothless smile the laptop creates a \u201cconception\u201d of what it would like to paint, based on its mood. The mood comes from a \u201csentiment analysis\u201d of recent Guardian articles, as it happens (on average reading the Guardian is a downer, apparently, apart from the stuff about gardening). Yesterday the Fool was in such a bad mood that it sent someone away unpainted; today it is feeling \u201cpositive\u201d. Next the Fool attempts to paint with a simulated brush and a simulated hand (actually, an image of Colton\u2019s hand) on the screen behind me. It learned to reflect its mood from the work of Dan Ventura, another computer scientist, at Brigham Young University in Utah, who trained a neural network to recognise the emotional attributes of images by sitting thousands of people in front of tens of thousands of paintings and asking them to tag each one with whatever adjectives came to mind. The Fool now knows that bright colours reflect a good mood, and \u201cpencils with tight hatching\u201d create a picture that is \u201ccold\u201d. When it is done, it prints out a page with a typed self-critique. \u201cOverall, this is quite a bright portrait,\u201d it says. \u201cThat\u2019s OK, but my style has lowered the level of bright here. So I\u2019m a bit annoyed about that.\u201d Here along with us, intrigued but too busy at her easel to watch, is Sarah Jane Moon, an artist who exhibits with the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. She doesn\u2019t want to see my teeth, either. \u201cWe paint from life,\u201d she says, \u201cand you can\u2019t hold a smile for sitting upon sitting. That\u2019s why all the traditional portraits show quite relaxed features.\u201d The Painting Fool is a special machine, and even slightly famous, but I can\u2019t deny that Moon is almost all of why I\u2019m excited to be here. The feeling of being painted by a real person, having them look at you and think about you, is exciting and flattering. Sentiment analysis and training data, on the other hand, don\u2019t add up to anything whose view of me I care about, and the finished portraits do not change my mind. Moon\u2019s is a lovely, real thing, which feels straight away like one person seen by another. The Fool\u2019s three efforts have qualities I like, but mostly they look like photographs that have gone through some kind of software filter. Colton insists the Fool is here \u201cto learn to be better\u201d but I look and think: so what?     Leo Benedictus as seen by Sarah Jane Moon\u2026       \u2026and as imagined by the Painting Fool laptop. Photograph: Murray Ballard    Then I think some more. For one thing, it turns out that art is more mechanical than I\u2019d realised. \u201cI try to look at Leo as an abstract set of shapes, forms, colours, tones,\u201d Moon tells Colton, \u201cto get away from the fact that that\u2019s a nose. Because when you start to do that, you get caught up in what you think looks like a nose.\u201d \u201cWhat the software does is break it down into colour regions,\u201d Colton says. \u201cYes, exactly,\u201d Moon agrees. \u201cI think that\u2019s what the best painters do. It\u2019s transcribing.\u201d Afterwards she tells me she felt a kind of \u201ckinship\u201d with the software as they worked side by side. More importantly, I realise that what matters isn\u2019t how the machine paints; it\u2019s how I see. Moon I understand, I think. She\u2019s a person and I know how that feels, so I care about her picture. But what does it feel like to be the Painting Fool? Is that what its portraits are trying to tell me? Verdict Moon\u2019s painting is far richer; the Fool is still learning and has centuries of practice to go. The translation test Google Translate was the first piece of proper science fiction to come true, and it\u2019s already a decade old. In many ways it typifies where AI has got to. Useful, sure; impressive, without question; but still clunky as hell, despite big improvements. If you haven\u2019t used it, it works like this: enter text or web links in any of 103 supported languages and you get a rough translation seconds later in any of the others. The app on your phone will transcribe what you say and then speak it back, translated (32 languages supported); it can replace the text of a foreign language sign or menu wherever you point the camera. No explanation is needed of how cool that is (and it\u2019s free).    Google Translate is surprisingly popular for dating. Things like \u2018I love you\u2019 and \u2018You have beautiful eyes\u2019    Globally, half a billion people use Google Translate each month, mostly those who don\u2019t speak English (which is 80% of people) but who want to understand the internet (which is 50% English). \u201cMost of our growth, and actually most of our traffic, comes from developing or emerging markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, India, Thailand,\u201d says Barak Turovsky, head of product management and user experience at Google Translate. It\u2019s surprisingly popular for dating, too, he adds. \u201cThings like \u2018I love you\u2019 and \u2018You have beautiful eyes\u2019, that\u2019s very prevalent.\u201d The software has always used a form of statistical machine learning: scouring the internet for already translated text \u2013 UN declarations, EU documents \u2013 and mapping the likelihood of certain words and phrases corresponding to one another. The more data it gathers, the better it gets, but the improvement levelled off a couple of years ago. Soon, Turovsky says, they will deploy new deep learning algorithms, which will produce much more fluent translations. Even so, there are limits, and some seem fundamental when you talk to a human translator and realise how subtle their work is. Ros Schwartz and Anne de Freyman volunteer for this task. Both are professional French/English translators, and I need two because, in order to judge how good the translation is without being fluent in both languages, we need to translate twice \u2013 once out of English into French, once back again. Google Translate keeps no memory of the original and can do the same thing. I choose a short passage of distinctive but not especially wild or ambiguous prose from the beginning of Herzog by Saul Bellow. Translators normally require context, so I tell Schwartz and De Freyman that it comes from a famous mid-century American novel.       Within a few days, Schwartz and De Freyman return a very smooth facsimile of the original text. Here and there some nuances have not survived, but the passage remains a pleasure to read, and the main meanings come across exactly. Google Translate takes only a few seconds, and the result is both impressive and inadequate, weirdly good in places, in others weirdly bad \u2013 turning \u201che\u201d into \u201cit\u201d and concocting the idea that Herzog is in love. Miraculously, it keeps \u201ccracked\u201d as a description of the hero. French has no word that combines the sense of \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmad\u201d that cracked coveys in English, so De Freyman makes it \u201ccingl\u00e9\u201d, which comes back from Schwartz as \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cGoogle Translate would look at statistical probability and say, what does \u2018cracked\u2019 mean?\u201d Turovsky explains. \u201cAnd statistically, it will try to decide whether it means \u2018cracked\u2019 or \u2018crazy\u2019 or whatever. That, for a machine, is a non-trivial task.\u201d Nor is it simple for a human, even though we find it easy. You\u2019d have to ask whether Bellow could have meant that Herzog was \u201ccracked\u201d as in physically fractured. Then you\u2019d have to assume not, because human bodies don\u2019t generally do that. So you\u2019d wonder what he did mean and assume instead, if you were not already familiar with the usage, that he must mean \u201ccrazy\u201d, because you understand the rest of what you\u2019ve read. But to do all this, wouldn\u2019t Google Translate have to be pretty much conscious, I ask? Turovsky laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to answer that question.\u201d Verdict Some bullseyes and howlers from Google Translate, while Schwartz and De Freyman are fluent and exact.", "tags": ["Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Robots", "Consciousness", "Computing", "Science", "Technology", "Art and design", "Google", "Culture", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-06T06:13:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/10/climate-change-melbourne-renewable-energy-project-provides-global-blueprint", "sentences": ["Global interest in the Melbourne project mainly comes from C40 Cities Climate Leadership group, an international group of 75 \u201cmegacities\u201d from six continents, including London, Paris, Beijing, Shanghai and New York, which exchange knowledge and ideas to combat climate change."], "title": "Climate change: Melbourne renewable energy project provides global blueprint", "article": "It\u2019s an unmistakably Melbourne setting: councillor Arron Wood is the city\u2019s environment portfolio chairman, standing in a rooftop courtyard as the faint sound of trams rises up from Swanston Street down below and the surrounding skyline reaches into a cool autumn sky.  Against this backdrop, not to mention the solar thermal panels on the next level, Wood does not hold back when discussing how cities can lead from the front in tackling climate change. He evokes the philosophy of Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor who has been a major driver of climate change action by the world\u2019s cities. \u201c[Bloomberg] says, \u2018Nations talk and cities act\u2019, and cities can do a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of what is required for the Paris agreement [on climate action].\u201d  Now a large project by the city of Melbourne could prove Bloomberg\u2019s theory correct. More importantly, major cities around the world are watching closely to see if Melbourne\u2019s strategy could become a blueprint for them to follow.    Related: Four visionary renewable energy projects that could pay off for Australia    The Melbourne renewable energy project, conceived and managed by the city council, has been two years in the making. Thirteen major institutions operating in the city have formed a consortium that will sign an agreement to purchase a large chunk of their electricity from a new large-scale renewable energy project.  The consortium members are the city of Melbourne, Australia Post, National Australia Bank, the University of Melbourne, RMIT, data centre operator NEXTDC, Zoos Victoria, the city of Port Phillip, Moreland city council, the city of Yarra, Citywide, Melbourne convention and exhibition centre and Bank Australia. If the project goes ahead, it will reduce Melbourne\u2019s carbon emissions by 138,000 tonnes per year.  The strategy will give a would-be project the chance to secure a buyer for the electricity it would produce but it also overcomes the reality that none of those 13 organisations would be big enough on their own to sign such a large-scale energy agreement.  A tender process is underway to find a proponent to provide 110GWh of renewable energy each year, enough to power 28,000 homes. The tender deadline is 20 June and, as the process is confidential, the council has not revealed which energy companies have submitted proposals. Hypothetically a proponent might already have an advanced plan to build a large-scale solar or wind energy plant somewhere outside Melbourne but still need to secure a long-term buyer of the electricity before an investor will come on board with money for construction. If the Melbourne consortium were to sign a 10-year purchase agreement with that proponent, the proponent would have the certainty required to go ahead with its project.  The strategy is revolutionary, as it is the first time in Australia that a group of buyers has joined forces to purchase large-scale renewable energy. In fact, the council says it is not aware of a similar model anywhere in the world, especially under the leadership of a city council.  \u201cWe don\u2019t often talk about government being the innovators but this is a really innovative project driven by the city of Melbourne,\u201d Wood says.     Councillor Arron Wood, the City of Melbourne environment portfolio chairman, is working on the Melbourne Renewable Energy project.    Global interest in the Melbourne project mainly comes from C40 Cities Climate Leadership group, an international group of 75 \u201cmegacities\u201d from six continents, including London, Paris, Beijing, Shanghai and New York, which exchange knowledge and ideas to combat climate change.  C40\u2019s interest was underlined by a visit to Melbourne from the group\u2019s London-based executive director, Mark Watts, in March to examine the council\u2019s strategies to become a low-carbon city.  Watts described the consortium model as \u201ca fantastic initiative\u201d that reflected the need for innovative solutions.  \u201cBy partnering with other major energy users in the [city] from the University of Melbourne to Bank of Australia to the city zoo, they have created a guaranteed market for renewable energy that makes a renewable plant look like a great investment for energy companies,\u201d Watts says.  \u201cIt is this kind of innovation and collaboration that is making cities and mayors such exciting leaders in the climate change field.\u201d Watts believes the Melbourne model could be exactly what other cites around the world need, particularly as most cities, including Melbourne, have no direct control over electricity generation. \u201c[This project] provides a model for how cities and other organisations can come together to leverage their combined purchasing power into the market,\u201d he says.   Related: Most voters support transition to 100% renewable energy, says Australia Institute    \u201cThis is a model that has the potential to be copied, adapted and built upon all around the world and that\u2019s what makes it so exciting.\u201d It is the kind of international attention that leads Wood to believe the city has struck upon a successful model, even if it is in its early stages.  \u201cMy belief is that the biggest impact of this project will be in its replication,\u201d Wood says. \u201cOur officers have already started work on a model which can be effectively grabbed off the shelf and used by anyone.\u201d The council has set itself a target to source 25% of the municipality\u2019s energy from renewables by 2018. Right now, that figure sits at 12% and Wood says, even with the 110GWh project, a lot more will need to be done to reach the target. The project is the biggest step so far in the city of Melbourne\u2019s overall wide-ranging efforts to mitigate climate change, including partnering with businesses to make buildings more sustainable and working to replace the city\u2019s streetlights with LED lighting. Bringing together an group of completely unrelated businesses and institutions to purchase 110GWh of renewable electricity might seem like a maverick idea but the City of Melbourne\u2019s chief executive, Ben Rimmer, says the council has studied the economics closely.  \u201cWe have done a lot of very careful homework, including the request for information process,\u201d Rimmer says. \u201cThis is not something that we have dreamed up in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been doing for some time with professional advisors. We are very confident that it is going to be a good financial deal.\u201d ", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Business in Australia", "Energy"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-10T03:11:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/10/horse-racing-tips-saturday-11-june", "sentences": ["Bath  1.45 Putaringonit 2.20 Groupie 2.55 Monumental Man 3.30 Gratzie 4.05 Marcano (nap) 4.40 Inclination 5.15 Andar Chester  2.15 Carson City 2.50 Sellingallthetime 3.25 Morando 4.00 Reflektor 4.35 Colourfilly 5.10 Straightothepoint Hexham  2.05 Darsi Dancer 2.40 Byron Flyer 3.15 Pekanheim 3.50 Always Tipsy 4.25 Another Bill 5.00 Sharivarry 5.35 Black Ivory  Leicester  6.10 Ventura Blues 6.40 Chilworth Bells 7.10 Quantum Dot 7.40 Ebony N Ivory 8.10 Sainted 8.40 The New Pharaoh (nb) 9.10 The Special One Lingfield  5.50 Cape Crystal 6.20 Wordismybond 6.50 Paco\u2019s Angel 7.20 Shanghai Glory 7.50 Crystallographer 8.20 Ettie Hart 8.50 Gift From God  Musselburgh 2.00 Samran Says 2.35 Sweet Selection 3.10 Stanghow 3.45 Judicial 4.20 Hidden Rebel 4.55 Blue Jacket 5.25 Neuf Des Coeurs Sandown  1.40 Majdool 2.10 Wild Hacked 2.45 Dolphin Vista 3.20 Easton Angel 3.55 Major Pusey 4.30 New World Order 5.05 Desdichado York  1.50 Tapis Libre 2.25 Withernsea 3.00 Mindurownbusiness 3.35 Dancing Star 4.10 Normandy Knight 4.45 Jacquard 5.20 Bop It"], "title": "Horse racing tips: Saturday 11 June", "article": "Bath  1.45 Putaringonit 2.20 Groupie 2.55 Monumental Man 3.30 Gratzie 4.05 Marcano (nap) 4.40 Inclination 5.15 Andar Chester  2.15 Carson City 2.50 Sellingallthetime 3.25 Morando 4.00 Reflektor 4.35 Colourfilly 5.10 Straightothepoint Hexham  2.05 Darsi Dancer 2.40 Byron Flyer 3.15 Pekanheim 3.50 Always Tipsy 4.25 Another Bill 5.00 Sharivarry 5.35 Black Ivory  Leicester  6.10 Ventura Blues 6.40 Chilworth Bells 7.10 Quantum Dot 7.40 Ebony N Ivory 8.10 Sainted 8.40 The New Pharaoh (nb) 9.10 The Special One Lingfield  5.50 Cape Crystal 6.20 Wordismybond 6.50 Paco\u2019s Angel 7.20 Shanghai Glory 7.50 Crystallographer 8.20 Ettie Hart 8.50 Gift From God  Musselburgh 2.00 Samran Says 2.35 Sweet Selection 3.10 Stanghow 3.45 Judicial 4.20 Hidden Rebel 4.55 Blue Jacket 5.25 Neuf Des Coeurs Sandown  1.40 Majdool 2.10 Wild Hacked 2.45 Dolphin Vista 3.20 Easton Angel 3.55 Major Pusey 4.30 New World Order 5.05 Desdichado York  1.50 Tapis Libre 2.25 Withernsea 3.00 Mindurownbusiness 3.35 Dancing Star 4.10 Normandy Knight 4.45 Jacquard 5.20 Bop It", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-10T16:44:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/jackie-chan-warcraft-success-china-scares-americans-chinese-box-office-blockbuster", "sentences": ["Speaking this weekend at the Shanghai film festival, Chan said the result will worry Hollywood execs."], "title": "Jackie Chan: Warcraft's success in China scares Americans", "article": "Jackie Chan thinks the success in China of video game adaptation Warcraft: The Beginning could lead to an increase in homegrown blockbusters.

Every day it is changing,\u201d the Chinese winemaker explains, slaloming between French, English and Mandarin as she tours her 70-hectare (170-acre) vineyard at the heart of a region government officials are calling China\u2019s Bordeaux.  Gao, a 40-year-old who trained at Bordeaux University\u2019s oenology institute, was one of the first vintners to set up shop in this arid corner of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, more than 600 miles west of Beijing. Armed with a 300,000 yuan (\u00a332,000) loan from her parents, she founded Silver Heights, her award-winning boutique winery, almost a decade ago.     Emma Gao, founder of Silver Heights winery, at her vineyard on the eastern flank of the Helan mountain. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    In 2012 she opened a vineyard on the stony eastern slopes of the Helan mountain, wagering that its parched land could produce world-beating wines. \u201cThere was nothing,\u201d Gao recalls, weaving through newly planted lots of cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, marcelan and petit verdot. Four years on and a scramble for land is under way here as Chinese and international wine giants and super-rich would-be vintners follow Gao\u2019s lead, ploughing fortunes into Ningxia wineries.  \u201cIt\u2019s a gold rush,\u201d says Fongyee Walker, a Beijing-based wine buff who learned her trade as the head of the Cambridge University Blind Wine Tasting Society and has made numerous trips to Ningxia province.     Chinese drinkers consumed 1.86bn bottles of vin rouge in 2013. Photograph: Mike Clarke/AFP/Getty    Visitors to Helan county, which authorities liken to Napa valley in California, can be in no doubt they have landed in China\u2019s wine heartlands. A highway running north-south through the region is dotted with signs guiding drivers to an abundance of chateaux with Chinese characteristics. There is Chateau Lanyi, Chateau Xunniu, Chateau Yu Fang, Chateau Ge Liqi, Chateau Flower Red and Chateau Zhi Hui Yuan Shi. Further along you reach the Domaine Pu Shang, the Domaine Ming Lu, the Domaine Cheng Cheng and, finally, the Domaine Heyu Xinqin Zhong. In late May, as teams of migrant workers unearthed fields of vines, buried to protect them from Ningxia\u2019s punishing -25C winters, dozens of excavators could be seen carving out new vineyards from the region\u2019s rocky soils. Less than 60 years ago China was gripped by one of the worst famines in history as Mao Zedong\u2019s Great Leap Forward push for industrialisation devastated the economy and killed up to 45 million people. Since then, decades of dramatic economic growth have transformed the country \u2013 not just into the world\u2019s second largest economy but also one of its biggest wine producers, with more vineyards than France. Chinese drinkers consumed 1.86bn bottles of vin rouge in 2013, making China the world\u2019s largest red wine market.      Barrels of red wine in a cave cellar in Danba county, Ganzi Tibetan autonomous prefecture. Photograph: How Hwee Young/EPA    As that love affair has intensified, cash-flush wine fanatics have gone on a global spending spree. More than 100 of Bordeaux\u2019s estimated 7,000 chateaux are reportedly owned by Chinese tycoons such as Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, who has snapped up two such properties, the Chateau de Sours and the Chateau P\u00e9renne, this year alone.  Now, the chateaux are springing up back home too, with Ningxia, an impoverished coalmining region south of the Gobi desert, becoming ground zero for budding Chinese vintners. There are 207 registered wineries in Ningxia compared with just one in 1983, according to Gao Lin, Emma Gao\u2019s 72-year-old father and business partner.  Foreign wine producers are also joining the rush. In 2013 Mo\u00ebt Hennessy opened the Domaine Chandon, a 6,300 sq-metre winery producing sparkling wine, not far from Silver Heights.  Walker, the director of Dragon Phoenix wine consulting in Beijing, says that with time and training China could produce top-quality wine. \u201cI believe very firmly that you can make good wine anywhere if you put enough love, energy and effort into it. I don\u2019t think there is anything sacred about the rocks of the M\u00e9doc or the schist of the Mosel.\u201d     Villagers in Bagou, Sichuan province, toast a birthday with wine. China is the world\u2019s largest market for red wine. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty    But comparisons to Bordeaux or Napa are Communist party boosterism. \u201cIt\u2019s like comparing a painting painted by [an artistically gifted] toddler \u2026 and a painting done by an artist,\u201d she says. Gao\u2019s husband, the French winemaker Thierry Courtade, was less coy about Ningxia\u2019s potential. \u201c[My dream is] \u201cto be as good as Bordeaux\u201d, says the 46-year-old, who worked at the heart of France\u2019s wine industry, at the Chateau Calon-S\u00e9gur, before relocating to Helan county three years ago. \u201cWe are almost there.\u201d With experts warning that climate change could decimate production in the world\u2019s premier wine regions, Gao says Ningxia could provide a key alternative to places such as California, Bordeaux and Western Cape in South Africa.  \u201cI think it could be the new world of the New World,\u201d she says at her father\u2019s small family vineyard in Yinchuan, the provincial capital. \u201cWe don\u2019t promise. We just try. We believe.\u201d  Chinese wines have received mixed reviews since they entered the international stage.  In some, critics have detected hints of \u201cdirty sweat socks and cleaning fluid and a foul chemical taste\u201d or even \u201ca smell of baked dead mouse\u201d. Others have deemed some Chinese wines \u201centirely respectable\u201d and \u201ccompetently made\u201d, if lacking distinctiveness.      Ling Shixiong, Silver Heights\u2019 vineyard manager. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Gao\u2019s reserves have fared better. Less than a decade after she imported her first grape press from Italy, Silver Heights produces about 60,000 bottles a year. They are mostly sold in upmarket restaurants and hotels in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Walker describes her as \u201cthe best of the best\u201d in China.  Other regional producers have also earned plaudits with Ningxia merlots, ros\u00e9s and syrahs picking up a record number of medals at last year\u2019s Decanter Asia wine awards. Gao, the granddaughter of People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers who preferred shots of throat-singeing baijiu to decanters of burgundy, says a new generation of Chinese oenophiles meant her industry, which has been hit by President Xi Jinping\u2019s anti-corruption campaign, has a bright future.  But vintners urgently need to tackle prejudice against made-in-China vintages. \u201cOur people do not believe in our products,\u201d she admits. \u201cEven our toilets we buy from Japan. We buy milk powder for our babies from Hong Kong or France \u2026 I buy my toothpaste from Australia.\u201d      A vine manager checks grapes in west Shanxi province. Photograph: Adrian Bradshaw/EPA    There are other hurdles. Experts fear the dramatic influx of wine producers to Ningxia means there will simply not be enough water to support the industry. \u201cWinemaking requires on average six to seven litres of water for every litre of wine,\u201d says Walker. \u201cWhere is it going to come from?\u201d Soaring land prices are also causing small producers such as Gao to lose sleep. \u201cBefore it cost nothing; now it\u2019s very expensive. Maybe 10 times more,\u201d she says.  Over a chilled glass of her 2014 Ningxia chardonnay, Gao concedes that comparisons with Bordeaux may have been premature. \u201c[Perhaps in] a thousand years,\u201d she laughed. But, in some ways, the winemaker says her home in China\u2019s harsh interior reminds her of France: \u201cWe have sunshine like Avignon.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao", "tags": ["China", "Wine", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-14T00:08:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jun/14/hollywood-films-in-china-asia-market-warcraft-the-beginning", "sentences": ["A co-production with a Chinese company led to a major location change from Paris to Shanghai for key scenes, extended for the Chinese release, and it became the first US film to open to more money in China than at home."], "title": "Eastern promise: the Hollywood films making their money in China", "article": "The ambitiously, or perhaps foolishly, titled orcs v humans video game adaptation Warcraft: The Beginning was perceived as not just a standalone summer blockbuster but the first instalment in an epic new series of adventures. Before the film had even been released, director Duncan Jones was teasing that more was to come and Universal, a studio that\u2019s seen franchises bloom in recent years from Fast &amp; Furious to Despicable Me to Fifty Shades, was surely eyeing a Lord of the Rings style profit-making saga.   Related: Duncan Jones on Warcraft: 'If you get it wrong, people are going to be upset'    But as every poorly received trailer and poster landed online, the buzz started to smell worse than the inside of an orc\u2019s boot. The reviews were reflective of this undeniable stench. It was labelled \u201ca contender for the worst movie of the year\u201d and one reviewer hoped that the sequel \u201clanguishes in development hell forever\u201d. Audiences made this a safe bet with a disastrous US opening of just $24.4m, meaning its domestic gross would be unlikely to make back even half of its $160m budget. Game over. But on the other side of the world, one country was desperately inserting coins to continue. Warcraft opened in China to a record-breaking five-day total of $156m, the highest ever debut for a foreign release, thanks to the game\u2019s popularity, a whopping 26 brand sponsors and a stack of specially created localised marketing materials. Along with a strong showing from other countries, it\u2019s up to $300m worldwide, with analysts suggesting that an entirely achievable $450m would be the magic break-even number that might even lead to a sequel.  Its success has come just a week after news of John Boyega signing on to star in Pacific Rim 2, pushing the film closer to production. In 2013, this seemed an unlikely proposition. The reviews were more positive for Guillermo del Toro\u2019s brash monster movie, but it failed to find the required audience in the US. A $101m total might sound respectable but from a $190m budget, it\u2019s a disaster. Yet the film scored overseas, making $114m in China and topping out at $411m worldwide.     Rinko Kikuchi in Pacific Rim. Photograph: Warner Bros    The sequel, again teased early on by the original film\u2019s director, was still far from a sure thing, but in the years since China\u2019s box office has become even more important, with 2016 set to be the year that the country overtakes the US. Pacific Rim 2 then became the first Hollywood sequel to be greenlit thanks to international audiences, and, if China continues to embrace the orcs actioner, Warcraft: The Middle could well be on the way. However, it\u2019s not guaranteed. The resurrection of the Terminator franchise was seen as a regrettable decision by critics and audiences in the US, but in China, Terminator: Genisys was a hit, making $113m compared with a US total of just $89m. Ultimately, Paramount decided against their planned sequel, despite a $440m worldwide number.    Related: Paramount sued by Chinese company for failed Transformers product placement    There\u2019s also a problem with heritage when it comes to Chinese blockbusters. The success of Warcraft and Pacific Rim could be traced back to their relative newness. But the success of sequels and reboots often relies on brand awareness, and since many Hollywood films have never been released in China, that\u2019s not always easy to ensure. Star Wars: The Force Awakens broke records around the world, but it was only moderately successful with Chinese audiences and its final underwhelming gross was seen by some analysts as the reason why the film didn\u2019t beat Avatar\u2019s international record. The first film in the series to be released in the country was Phantom Menace in 1999, meaning the saga doesn\u2019t have the same feverish cult following in China. The forthcoming spin-off Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has smartly recruited Chinese stars Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen.     Joseph Gordon Levitt in Looper. Photograph: Sony Pictures/AP    If we\u2019re being cynical, it\u2019s a tactical casting decision, but it\u2019s far from a new trend. Transformers: Age of Extinction was part-funded by China Movie Channel and utilised local talent and locations, while Iron Man 3 included extra footage in China with popular actor Fan Bingbing. It all started, though, with a more modestly budgeted film: 2009\u2019s indie time-travel thriller Looper. A co-production with a Chinese company led to a major location change from Paris to Shanghai for key scenes, extended for the Chinese release, and it became the first US film to open to more money in China than at home. Working with a Chinese company also means that the film is exempt from the country\u2019s strict annual quota of just 34 foreign movie releases (a number that may increase next year). Warcraft: The Beginning was also a co-production between Universal and Legendary, a company that has recently become a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Wanda Media Group. Next year, the company is set to release prequel Kong: Skull Island and The Great Wall, a China-set fantasy adventure from director Zhang Yimou starring Matt Damon, a film that\u2019s a clear sign of a growing commercial relationship between the two countries as well as a creative one.   Related: China sentences man to seven years in jail for watching 'sensitive' film    It\u2019s still likely to leave many Hollywood films unaffected but could lead to worrying side-effects. While spectacle translates well to international audiences, humour isn\u2019t always as easy. Guardians of the Galaxy proved a hit with critics and audiences in most of the world, but it didn\u2019t catch on in China. The title translation to Interplanetary Unusual Attacking Team goes some way to explain why the film\u2019s unique brand of comedy was tough to convey. The less joke-heavy X-Men: Apocalypse has already eclipsed it.     Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library    It\u2019s also likely to affect content on a broader level, with Chinese censorship still notoriously stringent. Deadpool was denied a release in the country thanks to its violence, nudity and language, while Crimson Peak was barred because of its supernatural content as the censorship guidelines prohibit films that \u201cpromote cults or superstition\u201d. An alarming, commercially minded future could see all blockbusters conforming to Chinese rules in order to maximise profits. The overseas success of Warcraft: The Beginning is an undeniable turning point for global box office, but the long-term effects remain unknown. Jackie Chan believes that it will lead to more homegrown blockbusters, once the Chinese film industry realises the money that can be made. That would make sense and hopefully curb an influx of overly modified US offerings. Appealing to an international audience doesn\u2019t need to be a bad thing, but if the industry spends too much time and effort directing content to one country, one that has an entirely different view on so many issues, Hollywood could end up losing its domestic audience.

Twelve years later, political slogans encouraged the Chinese people to embrace free market economic policies that were the antithesis of Maoist thought. Chinese society has changed in many ways since Deng Xiaoping\u2019s \u201creform and opening up\u201d campaign launched in 1978, but the Communist Party has continued to\u00a0craft slogans to promote policy. The\u00a0current rash of slogans, launched in 2013, are centred around the idea of the \u201cChinese dream\u201d.   Related: China\u2019s memory manipulators | Ian Johnson    According to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, this campaign aims to create moderate prosperity for all Chinese people and restore the country\u2019s former greatness. One of the best known posters for the campaign features a clay figurine of a peasant girl with a wistful expression. The image was chosen because one official felt \u201cit\u00a0represented longing and hope\u201d. Though much about the campaign remains vague, the phrase does capture the profound sense of ambition that runs throughout Chinese society. What\u2019s unclear is whether the party will be able to realise such dreams. This question is at the heart of Rob Schmitz\u2019s enjoyable and illuminating book, Street of Eternal Happiness, which explores the aspirations of some of the residents of a single street in Shanghai. Schmitz, a correspondent for\u00a0US National Public Radio, has lived with his family in an apartment in Shanghai\u2019s former French concession since 2010. Some of the best popular books about China of the last decade, such as Peter Hessler\u2019s Country Driving and Michael Meyer\u2019s The Last Days of\u00a0Old Beijing, have offered intimate portraits of small communities, typically a village or neighbourhood. The great virtue of these books is that they offer Chinese people a voice, something that is often lacking in news coverage. Schmitz writes with great affection about the shopkeepers and other residents of his street: in telling their stories, he shows how the goals of the Chinese state have \u201coften stood in the way of individual dreams\u201d. One of the core goals of the Chinese dream is to control the country\u2019s urbanisation. Someone from a small rural village who wants to live in a big city such as Beijing or Shanghai faces many official obstacles. All Chinese citizens have a hukou, a household registration document that ties them to\u00a0a particular place, and prevents them accessing social services and education if they go elsewhere. This has had profound consequences for many families throughout China, as many children have had to remain in their rural hometowns in order to go to\u00a0school while their parents work in distant cities. The problems faced by the children of flower seller Mrs Zhao are typical of millions of these \u201cleft behind\u201d children. Zhao\u2019s oldest son had to give up his education while the youngest, who grew up with little parental supervision, became sullen and withdrawn. One of the great benefits of\u00a0Schmitz\u2019s long relationship with the family is that he\u2019s able to show how Zhao and her two sons eventually overcome these obstacles, while still resenting rules that exclude migrants from many social and economic opportunities. \u201cWe are under the same leadership, and we are part of the same country,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we allowed to have the same rights?\u201d Like most cities in China, Shanghai has been transformed by building work since the early 1990s. City authorities rely heavily on the income they make from construction projects, and since all land in China is owned by the state, they are allowed to demolish people\u2019s homes, so long as some compensation is provided. Residents who oppose this face intimidation, threats and sometimes violence. Schmitz\u2019s apartment overlooked a large area of burnt-out and demolished buildings, some of whose residents still lived in the shells of their former homes. His own apartment building was built on a site where a resident who refused to leave died in\u00a0a fire started by thugs hired by a property developer. Mayor Chen, one of the residents who refused to leave, has faith that he will be able to gain proper compensation for his home, but\u00a0his wife is less optimistic. She thinks her husband is wrong to believe \u201cin a China that appears on television and looks perfect and nice\u201d. Chen\u2019s disillusionment is shared by\u00a0many of the older generation on Schmitz\u2019s street, such as Professor Wei,\u00a0who spent 23 years as a political prisoner. When asked what he thinks of the Chinese dream, he says: \u201cThe sound of it is very inspiring, but first the Chinese people need to rejuvenate their trust in this country.\u201d Many of Wei\u2019s generation suffered greatly under Mao, and have struggled in post-reform China. These include Auntie Fu and her husband Uncle Feng, who run a small restaurant on Schmitz\u2019s street. In the 1960s, both obeyed the government\u2019s call for people to help develop Xinjiang, a region in the far west of the country, though it meant considerable hardship for them. Neither has the skills nor connections to become successful in\u00a0the new society. Feng has no faith in\u00a0people or the government, while Auntie Fu is too credulous. Desperate to return to Xinjiang, she pours huge\u00a0sums of money into many dubious investments and pyramid schemes which she says are \u201czero risk\u201d. Schmitz\u00a0accompanies her to an underground church run by a former bandit, who attempts to get his elderly congregation to donate one-tenth of their income; and later to a sales pitch for a\u00a0pad that claims to promote sexual health if placed on the genitals. As Mayor Chen says after his home is finally demolished: \u201cThe government talks about the Chinese dream.

Inside the park, which is the size of nearly 600 football pitches , day trippers will find the largest Disney castle on earth, a pirate-themed stunt show, a Mandarin version of the Lion King Broadway musical and a hair-raising, neon-lit rollercoaster called the TRON Lightcycle Power Run.  To cope with the crowds 10,000 workers will be deployed on the opening day.  \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about what we\u2019re about to show the world,\u201d Disney chief Robert Iger, who has spearheaded the project, told CNBC on the eve of the opening.

The idea of building the mega-project was first conceived in the late 1990s but protracted and highly politicised negotiations with Chinese authorities meant permission was not granted until 2009 while construction only began in April 2011. During that time Disney chiefs have engaged in an intense lobbying campaign designed to secure permission to import Mickey Mouse to the land of Mao Zedong.  Speaking last week, Iger admitted that to make the project happen he had \u201cengaged with three presidents and a few premiers and a number of vice-premiers and a number of party secretaries and five or six mayors of Shanghai\u201d.      The idea of building the mega-project was first conceived in the late 1990s.

He didn\u2019t tell me specifically that he did, but I think [it] played a part in the approval of this.\u201d  At first glance China\u2019s Leninist regime and one of the world\u2019s biggest entertainment conglomerates make unlikely playmates. During the late 1940s, as Chairman Mao\u2019s troops prepared to seize power in Beijing, Walt Disney railed against attempts by the \u201cCommie front\u201d to infiltrate Hollywood studios.  President Xi meanwhile has called for hostile western values and ideas to be extirpated from Chinese universities and society since taking power in 2012.  But Robert Lawrence Kuhn, the author of How China\u2019s Leaders Think, said Beijing saw the theme park as part of an ongoing push to make Shanghai a world-class city.  \u201cChina wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragon\u2019s head, a showcase city for all the world to see,\u201d Kuhn told the New York Times. \u201cDisney is part of that grand strategy.\u201d      An aerial view of the resort.

About 330 million people \u2013 the equivalent of almost the entire population of South America \u2013 live within a three-hour drive or train journey from the resort, according to the company. About 10 million visitors are expected in the first year alone, paying between 370 yuan (\u00a340) and 499 yuan for an entrance ticket.  As a result major concessions have been offered to Chinese officialdom, with Disney relinquishing far greater control over the resort\u2019s planning and operation than it did ahead of the opening of its first project in China, in Hong Kong, in 2005.  According to reports in the Chinese media a state-owned company called Shanghai Shendi Group owns a 57% stake in the new resort while Disney holds the rest.  Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, told the New York Times such accommodation was now \u201cpart of the China trade-off\u201d as western companies squabbled for their piece of the China pie.  \u201cIf your market is so big we\u2019ll accept rules and regulations we wouldn\u2019t in other parts of the world,\u201d Damodaran said.", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "Theme parks", "World news", "Travel"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-16T01:50:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/16/media-briefing-thursday-16-june", "sentences": ["P37 iDisney opens Shanghai resort."], "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "article": "Top story on MediaGuardian Sky to air UK\u2019s first 24-hour eSports TV channelITV is also expected to invest in Ginx eSports TV, which will air tournaments including Turner\u2019s ELeague Top comment on MediaGuardian Sun\u2019s \u2018Brexit boost to shares\u2019 front page is a topsy-turvy take on the truthAggressive editing turns Deutsche Bank report on its head about the impact of Brexit on the financial markets Today\u2019s headlines The GuardianPrince William appears on cover of gay magazine Attitude.

Lam Wing-kee said his interrogators were particularly interested in who had supplied information for the book Xi Jinping\u2019s Dream of a 20-year Rule, published last year by Gui Minhai, who later went missing.  Banned on the mainland, the book accuses the Chinese president of trying to extend his rule beyond the 10 years normally served by Communist party leaders, in a similar way to how Vladimir Putin has been able to stay in power in Russia. Lam said he believed the crackdown was aimed at rooting out a clique within the party suspected of seeking to undermine Xi.   Related: Hong Kong bookseller speaks out about detention in China    \u201cIt looks very likely that that is the case,\u201d Lam said in an interview with the Guardian on Monday. \u201cThey were looking for sources of the books that had remained confidential.\u201d Last week Lam, 61, became the first of five detained booksellers to confirm he had been forcibly abducted and to provide details. After months of solitary confinement on the mainland, he said his interrogators had allowed him to return to Hong Kong this month to retrieve a hard drive containing names of mainland citizens who had purchased his books. Instead of going through with this arrangement, he decided to go public and stay in Hong Kong, despite potential consequences for his girlfriend on the mainland. Lam said he had agonised over the decision, fearing reprisals against his partner and also relatives of other booksellers. But he said he felt compelled to get the story out and could not bear the thought returning to China to face more interrogations and confinement. \u201cThey accused me of creating rumours of top leaders and said I posed a big threat to society. They said that people like me are deserving of the most severe treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me they could keep me for 10 to 20 years if I did not cooperate. I did not know where I was. It was very scary. Even now I get scared when I think about it.\u201d Lam\u2019s revelations have heightened fears that Hong Kong residents and Chinese-born critics abroad could be abducted wherever they live. Those fears first emerged when Gui, a Chinese-born Swedish citizen, disappeared from Thailand on 17 October and later ended up in detention on the Chinese mainland. Jerome Cohen, a China expert and professor of law at New York University, said Lam\u2019s case \u201coffers classic instruction about the arbitrary power of the Chinese police to detain and torture any of us within China and to reach beyond China borders\u201d. He said Lam\u2019s assertion that he was interrogated by a Chinese special investigative group \u2013 the same type of unit as has been used to take down senior party officials such as Zhou Yongkang, a senior politburo member convicted of corruption \u2013 was also instructive. \u201cHe has confirmed that this case is not the product of some out-of-control local officials in southern China but emanates from the party centre,\u201d Cohen said. William Nee, a China researcher for Amnesty International, said: \u201cLam\u2019s allegations would seem to indicate that this is being ordered from almost the highest levels of Chinese government.\u201d Lam said he learned that special forces were involved soon after he was stopped on 24 October while trying to enter the mainland through an immigration point in Shenzhen. He knew one of the police officers from a previous encounter. He tried joking with him, he said, but the officer made a grave expression and said he was part of special investigations unit. \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve made a big mistake,\u201d Lam recalled him saying. \u201cWe are here to interrogate you.\u201d Lam said he was taken blindfolded to a detention centre that he later learned was in Ningbo, near Shanghai. There his interrogators grilled him, daily at first and then every week or so as the months passed. That was the only time he was allowed to leave what he said was a padded cell, designed to prevent detainees from killing themselves. \u201cFrom morning to night I couldn\u2019t speak to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a form of psychological torture.\u201d By January, Lam said, he was thinking about suicide but could not find the means. He said his chance for freedom came when interrogators recognised that he could not provide valuable information on inside sources for the books. They then turned their interest to obtaining his customer list, which allowed him to go back to Hong Kong to retrieve the hard drive.  Lam said he had made up his mind to go public after seeing a video of 6,000 protesters in Hong Kong who came out in support of the booksellers. \u201cAfter watching that video, I thought: this is not just about a few people in Hong Kong, but all of Hong Kong. If I didn\u2019t speak out and neither did my colleagues, no one would know what has happened.\u201d ", "tags": ["China", "Xi Jinping", "Hong Kong", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-20T11:56:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/english-working-class-victims-brexit-vote-false-patriotism", "sentences": ["You can see people wearing the shirts of our Premier League teams from S\u00e3o Paulo to Shanghai."], "title": "The English working class will be the first victims of a Brexit vote | Billy Bragg", "article": "What\u2019s wrong with England? Everyone knows we have the best top-flight football in the world. You can see people wearing the shirts of our Premier League teams from S\u00e3o Paulo to Shanghai. Yet the England team has never won an opening game at the European Championship. What is it about the Euros that makes us freeze up? Northern Ireland and Wales have everything to gain from the competition, but for the English, anything other than winning will feel like a disappointment. We feel the pressure of history bearing down on us. England expects.   Related: Devolve power to England's regions | Billy Bragg    That sense of entitlement is even stronger off the football pitch. Our imperial history has left the English with the assumption that we should be respected, that our reputation should go before us, ensuring we eventually come out on top. That\u2019s how it was in the days of empire and that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been in the United Kingdom. In the past decade, however, that expectation has been challenged by expansion and integration in the EU, and by a confident independence movement in Scotland. In response the English have turned inward. Last year this tension was made manifest in the least British election of modern times. Voters disillusioned with the status quo reached out to smaller parties. In Scotland Labour was cast out by the SNP, but in England the first-past-the-post system prevented a breakthrough for Ukip. Now the referendum has levelled the playing field. For once, the votes of all of the English electorate will actually mean something. Having been ignored by Westminster for so long, is it any surprise that many are angry? For years the English working classes were taken for granted by New Labour \u2013 under the mistaken impression they had no one else to vote for \u2013 and patronised by the Tories, who sold them the lie of better services and lower taxation. Successive governments have encouraged the creation of the most deregulated labour market in Europe, undermining the very things that families build their security on: regular work, long-term tenancy, access to education and the support of local social services. The demand for cheap labour has led to an unprecedented influx of migrants, who have made their homes in areas where house prices and rents are lowest. While the middle classes have benefited from the skills these newcomers have brought, their presence has increased feelings of insecurity among the working class, who see the world changing at an ever greater pace and worry about their children\u2019s future. At the mercy of the invisible forces of globalisation, when someone offers them the chance to \u201ctake back control\u201d, they\u2019re likely to respond in the affirmative.   Related: No Boris, you can't have your Brexit cake and eat it too    Those leading the push for Brexit are no friends of working people, however. Boris Johnson\u2019s personal credo \u2013 \u201cI am pro having my cake and pro eating it\u201d \u2013 should have been their battlebus slogan. They are pitching Britain\u2019s exit from the EU as all gain and no pain. They promise the masses that everything they like will be better and everything they hate will be gone, when in truth what will be gone are the last vestiges of the welfare state that their grandparents built. For the leave campaign is driven by libertarians who seek to create, in the name of free enterprise, an even more precarious economy than that which has left so many of the English working class insecure and disillusioned.           How would Brexit affect you?    In pursuit of their goal the Brexiters have crossed the line between expressing people\u2019s fears and exploiting them, fomenting rage among those who feel left behind by globalisation. The dangers of such a tactic were made all too clear last week. Those who cloak their hatred with the mantle of patriotism tarnish our nation\u2019s great achievements and undermine the principles on which it was built. While others around them have strengthened their identities through devolution, the English \u2013 ignored for so long \u2013 have every right to feel hard done by, and their impulsive urge to send a two-fingered message to the ruling class via the referendum is understandable. But if we wake up on Friday to find that we have voted to leave the EU, the lid will soon be put back on the cauldron of grievance and dissent stirred up by the Brexit campaign, and our electoral system will continue to stifle the will of the English people. With neither a parliament to represent them, nor a method of forming a UK government that ensures everyone\u2019s voice is heard, the English will still be a long way from taking back control of their country.", "tags": ["EU referendum and Brexit", "Politics", "European Union", "UK news", "Devolution"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-20T16:07:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/21/bookseller-abduction-will-be-taken-up-with-china-says-hong-kong-leader", "sentences": ["\u201cWe are here to interrogate you.\u201d Lam said he was taken blindfolded to a detention centre that he later learned was in Ningbo, near Shanghai."], "title": "Bookseller abduction will be taken up with China, says Hong Kong leader", "article": "Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive has said he will raise concerns with Beijing over the case of a bookseller secretly detained for months in mainland China.

They still, however, refuse to accept the testimony of Dustin Johnson and others that no rule breach took place on the fifth green on Sunday afternoon. This is about as close as we will ever come to witnessing an apology from a governing body that affords itself exalted status. After the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay, where the site and course condition were clearly unfit for purpose, that this year\u2019s championship also had such controversy should raise serious questions about whether or not the USGA is appropriately carrying out its most high-profile role.   Related: US Open: Oakmont course has not been tricked up, says USGA    What has been overlooked in the Johnson fallout is that the incident which caused such a furore cuts to the very heart of where the USGA, and the R&amp;A, continue to neglect an area harmful to golf. It might be technical, it might be delving into the realms of golf geekery, but it is vital. Mike Davis, the USGA\u2019s chief executive, was brimming with pre\u2011tournament excitement when talking about how rapid the Oakmont greens were. Even a deluge of rain \u2013 three inches in 24 hours \u2013 could not make a meaningful difference. We know this because Shane Lowry called a penalty on himself after his ball moved when he was preparing to putt on Saturday. At Chambers Bay, the putting surfaces were ruined by a desire to make them akin to an ice wall in texture. Exhibit\u00a0C: the 2015 Open Championship, where play was suspended for hours on a sun-kissed Saturday because high winds ensured golf balls would be affected on greens at the far end of the Old Course. Yes, it was blowy, but every other course on the Fife coast was continuing as normal with medal play on the same afternoon. Only the home of golf shut down. Only the home of golf had greens cut to such a borderline level. The narrative is: fast greens great, slow greens bad news. And still, there is a case for less skill actually being necessary to merely tap a ball on a certain line. As long as greens are consistent throughout any given tournament, their speed should not matter. The trouble is, there has become a necessity for the greens to be as slippery as glass. It is seen as the most valid defence, and it is certainly the easiest, against players who can butcher even traditionally long holes. Oakmont had another barrier: ludicrous thick rough around greens, which meant chipping \u2013 a key facet of the sport \u2013 was not tested at all during the US Open. It was therefore somehow poetic that the Johnson case blew up so spectacularly in the face of the USGA. Surprise, surprise; on a stupidly quick green, well dried out on a Sunday afternoon, the ball was not stable. Early this month, the USGA and R&amp;A issued a paper on driving distance in professional golf. This release insisted that \u201cbetween 2003 and the end of the 2015 season, average driving distance on four of the seven tours increased about 1%, or 0.2 yards per year\u201d. This statement, for anyone with eyes in their head, was an insult to intelligence. No problem, nothing to see here.   Related: Dustin Johnson relieved rules melee had no impact on outcome of US Open    In insisting they were informing any debate, the bodies were trying to delude their audience into believing there is no issue. Next year the US Open will be hosted at Erin Hills, where the scorecard yardage stretches to 7,800 yards. Augusta National, one of the iconic venues in golf, has expanded to 7,400 yards \u2013 500 more than when Jack Nicklaus famously won in 1986 \u2013 and is likely to grow further if the club can conclude a deal to purchase land behind the 13th tee. The Old Course itself has been tampered with under the highly dubious guise of architectural improvement. The reason, a point which is staring the USGA and R&amp;A so squarely in the face, is technology. Or, more specifically, the distance the current golf ball is being hit. If these people really want to inform debate, they should provide details as to what happened from 1990 to 2002. By the timeframe they deliberately choose, the horse had not so much bolted as trampled all over golf\u2019s heritage. Golf has changed standard ball composition and size before. It has banned certain club groove types, just as other sports such as the javelin have appropriately acted when technology was flying forward, literally, too quickly. The process need not be problematic. Golf\u2019s ruling bodies also opted to ban the anchored putting stroke, and were right to do so, but their sleeping at the wheel for a far more serious equipment issue is a glaring contradiction. It does nothing to douse the argument that manufacturers have too much power. This resonates in junior golf; emerging players do not shape shots \u2013 and can\u2019t anyway, given the way balls are constructed \u2013 because they have no need to. Blasting it high and long generally, not quite exclusively, is the answer. At members clubs everywhere, sadly, discussions over how to make modifications aimed at offsetting how far the ball now goes are commonplace. Last November in Shanghai the R&amp;A\u2019s chief executive, Martin Slumbers, took umbrage with the suggestion he was \u201crelaxed\u201d about matters of distance. Slumbers\u2019s equivalent at the European Tour, Keith Pelley, sees nothing wrong whatsoever with golf balls flying as far as possible; he sees this as show business. You could argue that Pelley\u2019s claim was endorsed by Sunday at Oakmont. That the farce was intrinsically linked to what the USGA and R&amp;A have allowed to happen in general to their sport is beyond question. Perhaps, for that reason alone, the epic level of negative fallout was worthwhile.", "tags": ["US Open Golf 2016", "US Open", "Golf", "Sport", "Dustin Johnson"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-22T09:15:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/23/the-empire-of-things-how-we-became-a-world-of-consumers-frank-trentmann-review", "sentences": ["To survey the vast terrain, Frank Trentmann, a professor at Birkbeck and formerly the head of a \u00a35m research project on Cultures of Consumption, has delivered a monumental study, sweeping from Renaissance Europe to the burgeoning middle class of modern-day India, by way of 19th-century London, Berlin, Paris, Shanghai and pre- and postcolonial Africa."], "title": "Empire of Things by Frank Trentmann review \u2013 a world of consumers", "article": "This book addresses one of the most basic questions. To survey the vast terrain, Frank Trentmann, a professor at Birkbeck and formerly the head of a \u00a35m research project on Cultures of Consumption, has delivered a monumental study, sweeping from Renaissance Europe to the burgeoning middle class of modern-day India, by way of 19th-century London, Berlin, Paris, Shanghai and pre- and postcolonial Africa. Trentmann\u2019s message is subtle and comes in different shades across many chapters. But fundamentally, his aim is to undercut conventional political and cultural critiques of consumer society. Consumption, Trentmann tells us, isn\u2019t merely an empty exercise in social climbing, corrosive of the human spirit. Nor is it reducible to the homogenising anglobalisation of giant mass-producing corporations that JK Galbraith and Herbert Marcuse warned us against. Holding both crude sociology and simplistic economics at arm\u2019s length, Trentmann paints a rich picture of the variegated human impulses that have impelled the history of consumption: the search for \u201cdomestic comfort, fashion and novelty\u201d, the pleasures of shopping, the exotic taste for articles from \u201cfaraway lands\u201d, \u201cthe cult of domestic possessions and hobbies\u201d, and the mediatised inducements of the printed word, radio, cinema, TV, video and the digital age. In the 1500s, these impulses began to converge and direct economic behaviour in new ways around the globe. They found their matrix in an increasingly urbanised civilisation. \u201cBuy now, pay later\u201d was not an invention of the credit card era. Modern banking originated in Renaissance Italy. Along the way, tracing centuries of debate and controversy around consumption, Empire of Things lays out its own canon of civilisation, in which the heroes are the thinkers of the \u201cmaterial self\u201d, the philosophers who understood that \u201cthings are an inextricable part of what makes us human\u201d. From David Hume and Adam Smith, Trentmann passes by way of William James and Martin Heidegger to the French sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Bruno Latour. As those names suggest, mass consumption first fully unleashed its radical potential in 18th-century north-western Europe. But Trentmann is at pains to stress that there are now, and always have been, many cultures of consumption across the globe, most notably in Asia. Ming China easily outdid its European contemporaries in commercial and artisanal refinement. What held China back, according to Trentmann, was not a general aversion to consumption, but an unfortunate shortage of coal and an exaggerated reverence for the cultural precedents of the past. Because for Trentmann consumption is individualistic, creative and cosmopolitan, it is essentially within our control. Its history is not that of an anonymous social force. It is, for better and for worse, subject to politics. It was the violent imperialist ambition of 17th- and 18th-century mercantilism that set the consuming engines of the Dutch and British on their way. In the course of the 19th century, as it moves from the slave trade to Victorian experiments in sewerage and urban gas supply, Trentmann\u2019s narrative becomes noticeably more benign. So much so, in fact, that he almost skips over the rationing, deprivation and outright starvation of the first and second world wars, to arrive at 1945 and the \u201cpostwar period\u201d. For him, the welfare state is both a backstop to private affluence and a mode of consumption in its own right. Since the 1980s this has been obscured by a public discourse that revolves around a false contrast between public welfare provision and \u201cconsumer choice\u201d. As he makes clear, consumer politics was originally of the left not the right. In London and Berlin, activists campaigned for free trade, cooperatives and untainted milk. In colonial India and semi-colonial China, nationalists led boycotts of western goods. The sheer breadth of Trentmann\u2019s panorama is impressive and no one can fail to learn from it. But the scale of the narrative cannot hide the fact that it is riven by a fundamental contradiction. After he has assured the reader over hundreds of pages about the complexity and multivalence of consumer culture and politics, the conclusion strikes a very different note. As its author clearly recognises, the subject of consumption has an existential urgency, because the historical process of material self-realisation that he has so painstakingly reconstructed is crashing against environmental limits. And Trentmann feels called on to respond. But what kind of history does the environmental problem demand? As he himself acknowledges at the end of a fascinating disquisition about recycling, such topics and their history are a tiny drop in the bucket. What we actually need to address is the history of rampant fossil-fuel consumption. That, however, would require precisely the kind of history that Trentmann has spent 862 pages insisting he will not write, a history that shows how consumption and production became tied together in an expanding feedback loop of ever greater economic and material scope, a history of mass production and exponential economic growth. The obstacle here is Trentmann\u2019s scarecrow, Galbraith and his classic study The Affluent Society. Surely we can agree that the history of consumption and growth does not reduce to a narrative starting in 1945, based only in America and giving all agency to corporations and their hirelings in the media. But who ever imagined that we would?     Trentmann highlights the many cultures of consumption across the globe, most notably in Asia. Photograph: Christian Science Monitor/Getty Images    As Trentmann highlights in his conclusion, what we most urgently need are histories of the consumption of non-renewable resources, first among them carbon-based fossil fuels, starting with coal. But coal is barely mentioned in Empire of Things, except with regard to the question of urban gas supplies. What enabled coal to be transported to the farthest corners of the world was steam power and the railway, the driver of market integration on a continental scale, the enabler of far-flung exchange starting with the Sears mail-order business in 19th-century America and extending down to China\u2019s new overland Silk Road today. The railway is allotted a single index entry in the book, referring to a discussion of the impact of contact with the outside world on backwoods Mormon communities and the interest this aroused in fashionable handkerchiefs. After the railway would follow the entire noisy, exciting and polluting procession \u2013 mopeds, motorbikes, cars, air travel. Once upon a time, Fordism was a key concept for thinking about the relationship between mass production and mass consumption. It was, no doubt, a simplistic and self-serving myth. But Empire of Things rejects the mass-production paradigm to such an extent that Henry Ford is reduced to a cameo appearance as the patron of an anachronistic rural history museum. The Model T, the VW, the products of GM, Fiat and Toyota that shape everyday life all over the world are absent from Trentmann\u2019s account, while pages are given over to the idiosyncrasies of GDR consumer culture and its ludicrous Trabant. As Trentmann rightly emphasises, any history of consumption written today has passed the moment when the equation between affluence, Anglo-Saxon markets and liberal democracy can be taken as self-evident. The rise of Chinese state capitalism changes everything. But that raises the question of how he addresses the deeper history of growth-fixated authoritarian regimes. He does his best to subsume the 20th-century dictatorships under his capacious history of consumer politics. And it is true, of course, that \u2013 as in 1930s Britain or America \u2013 one could find cinemas, silk stockings, sweets and new-fangled motor cars in Mussolini\u2019s Italy and Hitler\u2019s Germany. Stalin\u2019s experts in mass consumption discovered the attraction of disposable cups on a trip to the west. But when, on the basis of such ephemera, Trentmann describes Stalin\u2019s regime as pushing \u201cconsumption forward\u201d, as did \u201cNew Deal America and Nazi Germany\u201d, the hair-raising lack of context becomes evident. In fact, consumption was brutally suppressed and millions starved to \u201cpay\u201d for one of the most brutal industrialisation drives in history. The history of consumption is becoming urgent. As Empire of Things teaches us, its cultures are varied. But we need to go beyond mapping that diversity. We need to link consumption to the chains of production and the mobilisation of resources that feed it. We need to face the painful and highly political trade-offs these processes involve. Only then will we have any hope of bringing history to bear on the questions that concern us most, both with regard to the return of Asia to the forefront of the world economy and to the future of the environment. \u2022 Adam Tooze\u2019s The Deluge: The Great War and the Remaking of Global Order is published by Penguin.

The Asia-Pacific region has for the first time overtaken North America both for the number of rich people and the wealth held by them, according to the annual world wealth report from consultancy firm Capgemini. Around the world, the number of \u201chigh net worth individuals\u201d (HNWIs) \u2013 defined as those with investable assets of at least $1m (\u00a3675,000) excluding their main home, art collection, vintage sports cars and other collectibles \u2013 rose nearly 5% in 2015 to 15.4 million. The combined wealth held by the global super-rich increased by 4% to $58.7tn, boosted by stock market gains in some parts of the world and higher property prices. However, the rate of growth in the wealth of HNWIs in North America slowed sharply last year, while in Brazil and Russia their numbers and wealth declined. The US still has the most HNWIs, almost 4.5 million. Japan is second, with 2.7 million, then Germany, with almost 1.2 million. China came fourth, with just over 1 million, followed by the UK, with 552,800 individuals, up 3,200 on 2014. The UK has been in the top five for some time.    wealthy persons graph for china and japan   China had the biggest rise in the number of wealthy people, up 16% on the previous year. The increase was down to sustained economic growth and rising property prices. China\u2019s super-wealthy include Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce business Alibaba, and its richest man, the property tycoon Wang Jianlin. In the UK, the collective personal fortunes of the super-rich rose 1.1% last year to $2tn. Britain is among the top four markets expected to drive wealth growth through to 2025, behind China, the US and India, according to wealth managers polled by Capgemini.  More than 4.5 million new HNWIs have been created globally since the height of the financial crisis in 2009.  In Asia-Pacific, the wealth of the super-rich soared 10% to $17.4tn last year, outstripping North America, where it grew 2% to $16.6tn, down from the 9% in 2014.   wealthy individuals graphic asia north america   While the US and Canadian economies put in a solid performance, equity markets finished the year in negative territory. In contrast, after a year of sharp swings, the Shanghai Composite and the Nikkei each ended 2015 more than 9% higher. Japan and China together accounted for 60% of the growth in the number of millionaires around the world last year. Asia-Pacific is expected to account for two-fifths of the world\u2019s wealth within the next 10 years \u2013 more than that of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa combined. David Wilson, wealth management expert at Capgemini, said this was driven by demographics, as Asia was approaching 3 billion people compared with half a billion in North America, as well as digital penetration. \u201cThe big story has been entrepreneurs in Asia,\u201d he added, while salary incomes and inheritance played an important role in Europe and the US.  In the US, an estimated $59tn of wealth is being transferred to heirs, charities, estate taxes and estate closing costs between 2007 and 2061. Of that $36tn is going to heirs. Latin America was hobbled by the poor performance of Brazilian equities last year, posting a 2% fall in the number of HNWIs and a near-4% decline in wealth. Europe\u2019s growth was steady, at nearly 5% for both the number of millionaires and their wealth, led by Spain, the Netherlands, France and Germany. Brazil, battered by the commodity price slump, political turmoil and sharp falls in currency and equity markets, was the poorest performing country in the world, losing 8% of its millionaires. Canada, Russia, Mexico and Singapore also recorded declines of between 2% and 3%. Capgemini said it had taken longer than anticipated for Asia-Pacific to overtake North America as the region with the biggest amount of wealth because of the slowdown in China, India and other countries in recent years. An alliance of organisations including ActionAid, Greenpeace International, International Trade Union Confederation and Oxfam warned that while the wealthy prospered, 702 million people living in extreme poverty were being left behind by a \u201cbroken economic system\u201d. Jenny Ricks of the Fight Inequality Alliance said: \u201cLast year the wealth of the richest totalled $58.7tn, which is over 150 times the size of the economies of all of the world\u2019s poorest countries combined. This shows the extent money and power are concentrated in the hands of the wealthiest few. \u201cFor every person with more than $30m, there are over 4,800 people living in extreme poverty. This gross inequality is a symptom of an unjust and unfair economic system that allows the rich to get richer at the expense of the poor.\u201d The Capgemini report showed that the number of ultra-rich people \u2013 those with assets worth more than $30m \u2013 rose at a slower rate than in previous years. Their number grew by just over 4% in 2015, compared with annual increase of nearly 8% between 2010 and 2014. Their wealth grew 2.5% last year compared with an average of 6% in the previous four years, dragged down by Latin America. If current trends continue, the wealth held by the world\u2019s richest is projected to exceed $100tn by 2025 \u2013 nearly triple the amount in 2006, according to Capgemini. Despite the financial crisis, the millionaires\u2019 wealth has expanded almost fourfold over the last 20 years. Ricks called on governments to reverse cuts to public spending, privatisation, tax breaks for the wealthy and \u201cthe race to the bottom on human rights\u201d. Capgemini said an unexpected trend of the past 20 years had been the high levels of cash held by the world\u2019s richest. Despite overall strong stock market performance, millionaires have continued to hold almost a quarter of their financial wealth in cash \u2013 to fund their lavish lifestyles as well as to protect against market volatility.", "tags": ["Global economy", "China", "Japan", "Chinese economy", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "US economy"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-23T16:43:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/24/china-twin-towers-hangzhou-skyscrapers-zhejiang-gate", "sentences": ["Despite the pace of recent developments \u2013 partly due to Hangzhou becoming a business hub for technology companies \u2013 the city has largely left the macho tower-building to its neighbour Shanghai, located 180km northeast, and China\u2019s other expanding megacities."], "title": "Seeing double: is Hangzhou's new construction the Chinese twin towers?", "article": "Hangzhou, a city in eastern China with a population of 9 million, is best known for its tourist-magnet West Lake area and historic buildings \u2013 even if local authorities have allowed the latter to be converted into McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks branches.

There is, however, another reason why artist\u2019s impressions of a major new Hangzhou development, set to begin construction next year, have caused a stir. The Zhejiang Gate Towers, designed by Australian-German firm Lava, bear a striking resemblance to New York\u2019s twin towers.

Hangzhou\u2019s Tianducheng development features a replica Eiffel Tower. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters    But talking to the Guardian from his Berlin office, Lava\u2019s co-founder Tobias Wallisser laughs off the twin towers comparison. \u201cWell, I did live in New York when I studied there, and of course the World Trade Center was an iconic structure,\u201d he says, adding that a World Trade Center copy was never part of Lava\u2019s Hangzhou design brief or specifically mentioned as a marker point. \u201cPut any two buildings together and they will probably resemble the World Trade Center,\u201d Wallisser adds. \u201cBut there are a few famous twin structures we have compared our new one to recently, such as Petronas Towers [in Kuala Lumpur]. The client wanted to have a simple, commercially viable building with a simple silhouette.\u201d Zhejiang Gate Towers will stand at 280 metres, making them the tallest buildings in Hangzhou, and as is the modern trend, will feature a mixture of retail, residential and office space. According to Wallisser, the original design had been more complicated than a basic twin tower structure, but was simplified to lower costs.  Rather than New York\u2019s famous twin towers, one of the main design ideas for the new Hangzhou structure was to have it reflect the Chinese character for the word \u201cgate\u201d: \u95e8     Zhejiang Gate Towers\u2019 design is influenced by the Chinese character for the word \u2018gate\u2019. Illustration: Lava    Following from this, the towers are apparently designed to offer visitors a grand welcome to the city, being visible from the road route in to the centre from Xiaoshan airport. \u201cThey [the client, Shimao Property] said from the beginning that it needs to be something that works from a distance,\u201d Wallisser explains. \u201cThat\u2019s how the idea that it should be marked as a gate came about.\u201d But Wallisser says he will understand if some people don\u2019t immediately make the connection between the towers\u2019 appearance and the Chinese gate character, on the structure\u2019s expected completion in 2020.

The institutions are part of a wider racket in which fraudsters trick prospective students into sending tuition fees to companies posing as legitimate higher education providers.  But the deception does not always stop there: there have been reports of Chinese students spending years at fake bricks and mortar colleges only to discover on the eve of graduation that they have been duped into studying for worthless degrees.  China\u2019s fake universities often have strikingly similar names to bona fide schools. Among the 30 institutions denounced this week are the Beijing Xinghua University, the Beijing Foreign Affairs Studies College, the Sichuan Vocational University of Technology and the Beijing Great Wall Research and Studies Institute.  The problem has become so serious that a special website was set up in 2013 to track the phenomenon.  Xia Xue, who runs that website, told Xinhua: \u201cIt is easy to see through the trick when they fake the names of well-known universities, but it is more difficult to identify if lesser-known institutions are faked.\u201d Last year Xia\u2019s group denounced 118 fake universities. \u201cThe exposed schools have used deceptive names and official websites that are similar to real, well-known universities,\u201d the China Daily newspaper reported at the time.

Thursday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood The Tory leadership contest promises to be a more lively and unpredictable betting heat today than any of the 35 races scattered around the country, but Epsom\u2019s meeting this evening offers punters in the capital a chance to escape from the turmoil and Hatsaway (6.30) could be the best bet on the card in the opening race.   Related: Horse racing tips: Thursday 30 June    Hatsaway\u2019s ability to handle the track needs to be taken on trust, but he went around Brighton smoothly enough to record a narrow win in early May and improved again for a more convincing success at Salisbury earlier this month off a 4lb higher mark. The five-year-old joined Pat Phelan from Clive Brittain at the start of the year and has made just three starts for the yard, and while he is up another 5lb today, there is every chance that his progress will continue. Shanghai Glory (7.15) also improved last time out when he was narrowly beaten into second place and should go close on the same card from a 2lb higher mark. Perth stages the only jumping card of the day, and Hills Of Dubai (2.10) should get off the mark over hurdles in the opening race. Quick Brew (3.40) has been knocking on the door for conditional jockey Daragh Bourke and could give him a useful winner in the two-mile handicap chase, while at Haydock this afternoon, Bear Valley (4.00) and Lady Joanna Vassa (3.00) should both go well. Lady Joanna Vassa has been busy recently but is holding her form well and has another win in her off her current mark.

By the afternoon, Hershey\u2019s had said no deal: \u201c[T]he board of directors of the Company unanimously rejected the indication of interest and determined that it provided no basis for further discussion between Mondel\u0113z and the Company,\u201d said the company in a public statement. The offer was for $107 per Hershey\u2019s share; news of the bid sent the stock price to $117. It stayed high even after news of the rejection. The deal would have merged the British and American distribution and manufacturing arms of the Cadbury chocolate company, which Mondelez purchased in 2009, when it was a part of Kraft, after management acquiesced to a hostile takeover bid. Hershey\u2019s currently produces and distributes Cadbury chocolates in the United States. The rumour sparked a rise in the market value of Hershey\u2019s, which rose from $21bn to $24bn. Mondelez is currently worth about $69bn. Hershey\u2019s shares didn\u2019t entirely erase their gains suggesting that investors believe a deal could yet get done. Any deal would depend on regulatory approval, as well as the blessing of the Hershey Trust, which controls 81% of shareholder voting power. Hershey\u2019s had an inauspicious 2015: shares fell by 15% and missed earnings estimates for the first two quarters of the year, in part because the company\u2019s Chinese businesses underperformed, notably Golden Monkey Food Company in Shanghai, which Hershey bought in 2013.  The trust itself, which has opposed acquisitions in the past, is a troubled entity: in May, the attorney general of Pennsylvania demanded resignations from three members of its 10-person board over misuse of funds. The Hershey Trust controls some $12bn and administers the Hershey School, an institution for poor children, funds from which were allegedly used to purchase a golf course in 2013. Mondelez divested itself of its grocery businesses in 2012 \u2013 when the firm was still called Kraft Foods \u2013 under shareholder pressure, and now focuses entirely on snack foods. The spun-off company, which kept the Kraft name, has since merged with Heinz, while Mondelez divested itself of a minority stake in coffee company Douwe Egbert in 2015 for $5bn. Now, it appears the company has returned to acquisitions. Mondelez\u2019s strategy of reshoring American jobs overseas in order to improve margins has been among the business decisions at issue in a presidential election season with an unusually strong focus on trade. Donald Trump vowed never to eat Oreos again (and exhorted competitor Chris Christie to do the same), despite profiting personally from the company\u2019s decision. The company has pledged to protect local jobs in Pennsylvania, should its purchase of Hershey\u2019s be approved, a source told the Journal.", "tags": ["Mergers and acquisitions", "Chocolate", "Business", "Food & drink", "Cadbury", "Mondel\u0113z"], "publicationDate": "2016-06-30T16:35:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/30/watford-turn-down-38m-odion-ighalo-shanghai-sipg", "sentences": ["Watford have turned down a \u00a338m offer for their striker Odion Ighalo from the free-spending Shanghai SIPG.", "Shanghai, who are managed by the former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, have the former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan in their squad as well as the newly arrived Hulk.", "Shanghai are fourth in the Chinese Super League after 15 games, 12 points behind the leaders Guangzhou Evergrande."], "title": "Watford turn down \u00a338m Shanghai SIPG offer for Odion Ighalo", "article": "Watford have turned down a \u00a338m offer for their striker Odion Ighalo from the free-spending Shanghai SIPG.

At the same time, it\u2019s a significant emitter of CO2 \u2013 the greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. So what can be done to disconnect the growth in aviation from the growth in carbon? The answer could lie in alternatives to jet fuel. But are these alternatives likely to be powering our flights any time soon? And what are the advantages of developing them? \u201cSustainable aviation fuel is not just pie in the sky but can really change our industry\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel,\u201d says George Davies, head of environmental strategy and assessment at Heathrow airport. \u201cQuite soon our airlines will be able to power aircraft via sustainable fuel. This is exciting and a big change,\u201d he says. Sustainable Aviation \u2013 an alliance of the UK\u2019s airlines, airports, aerospace manufacturers and air navigation service providers \u2013 is committed to developing a strategy that will reduce aviation\u2019s environmental impact. From its inception in 2005, Sustainable Aviation has been addressing climate change concerns and aviation\u2019s contribution to them.    Related: From Buenos Aires' buses to London's pods: the rise of transport innovation    Sustainable Aviation\u2019s Sustainable Fuels UK Road Map shows the likely path the emerging sustainable fuels market will take. The alliance believes that policy support and stability on the part of government, and financial support to develop, scale-up, and roll-out alternative fuels, will help put the UK at the centre of these innovations.  The UK government\u2019s target is to reduce aviation emissions so that by 2050 they are back to 2005 levels or lower, although this target has not been officially incorporated into legally binding carbon budgets due to international policy uncertainty. This is alongside the 2008 Act that commits the country to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. Dr Andy Jefferson, programme director, Sustainable Aviation, says: \u201cAs an industry we accept that we need to grow responsibly and this is a great opportunity to do that\u201d. \u201cLong-term aircraft propulsion solutions such as solar won\u2019t be available for 30 years and we need something that isn\u2019t fossil fuel over that period,\u201d he continues.  The answer to this will lie in one or more of the sustainable jet fuels currently at the research and development stage. However, one of the challenges at present is that sustainable jet fuel costs more than conventional fuel. Government support is needed to explore ways to address this, Jefferson believes. So which method of creating alternative jet fuel is likely to happen first? Sustainable Aviation has the following predictions. By 2020 There are technical opportunities in the UK involving waste gas capture (from industrial processing) - converting waste gas back to hydrocarbon to make fuel. Virgin is currently doing this with Lanzatech in Shanghai, China. The first flight powered by this method is estimated to take place in 2017. In 2014, British Airways announced an ambitious programme which would convert landfill waste into 16m gallons of jet fuel every year. Although the project is currently on hold in part due to lack of government support, if successful, could see carbon savings equivalent to taking 150,000 cars off the road. BA is currently looking for new partners.  Another technology involves the treating of plant sources grown on non-food producing sites \u2013 brownfield sites, or desert areas - with acids and enzymes which turns them into liquid fuel. This is currently being developed on a small-scale outside the UK. By 2030 Significant changes should have taken place since 2016. Government policies supporting sustainable jet fuels should be in place, and the UK could have between five and 12 operational plants producing them. This could add up to \u00a3265m gross value added, with 4,400 jobs created as a result.  The innovations of 2020 are becoming more established, and additional sustainable fuels are being investigated. The waste by-products of the sugar industry, for instance, could be converted into fuel. An estimated 0.7m tonnes of sustainable jet fuel are being produced per year. By 2040   Related: Heathrow CEO on cycle superhighways, emissions and 'doing more'    While Sustainable Aviation has worked out what is likely to happen by 2030, what happens really depends on the evolution of the industry. While sustainable liquid fuels should now be in active use, other methods \u2013 such as those derived from algae \u2013 may also be under consideration.  The next generation of aircraft, which will be introduced from 2035, should be more commonly part of airlines\u2019 fleets from 2040.  The amount of sustainable jet fuel per year could have doubled to 1.5m tonnes. By 2050  Sustainable jet fuels will continue to scale up and \u2013 as indicated by the CO2 roadmap \u2013 could reduce UK\u2019s aviation carbon dioxide emissions by up to 24%.  Which alternative fuels will be more established by now? Additional methods of powering aircraft may also be in use. Solar power, for instance, may become more realistic as early as 2035. Rolls Royce and Boeing Airbus are currently looking at this. So what steps is Heathrow itself taking? \u201cEnsuring we are ready to go when these fuels can be produced at scale,\u201d says Davies. \u201cWe are very aware of our significance here: we are a demand aggregator for 90 airlines.\u201d  Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with Heathrow, sponsor of the transport hub", "tags": [], "publicationDate": "2016-07-01T13:19:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/01/the-fiver-wales-belgium-euro-2016", "sentences": ["A busy day for Watford: they\u2019ve given Troy Deeney a new five-year deal, signed Christian Kabasele, edged closer to a move for the wonderfully monikered Isaac Success, and still found time to tell Shanghai SIP where to go with their \u00a338m bid for Odion Ighalo."], "title": "The Fiver | Cramming square pegs in round holes", "article": "SIX GAMES TO GO As a whippersnapper The Fiver would often be strapped into the back of Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s jalopy during school holidays and get driven through the valleys for a week at F.U.N camp.

It was after midnight on 8 June and fans of the blockbuster game had queued for ages to see the big-screen version. But the late hour did nothing to dampen the carnival atmosphere: fans had come armed with game props, and were in costume, or at least wearing T-shirts with official logos. Cinemas across China were decked in the colours of the hit video game\u2019s opposing camps \u2013 the blue Alliance flag and the red Horde banner. Seats were also split between red and blue. He Shuai, a 27-year-old World of Warcraft devotee, told newspaper Shanghai Daily: \u201cIt was like a festival.\u201d By the end of its first week, the popularity and huge commercial success of the film was threatening to turn China\u2019s relationship with Hollywood on its head. The $160m film Warcraft was a critical and financial flop in the US, making just $24.4m in its opening weekend. The story in China was completely different: the film racked up a whopping $156m in its first five days \u2013 more than Star Wars: The Force Awakens did in its entire theatrical run ($124m). The success of Warcraft the film was partly down to the huge and fanatical following the gaming franchise has in China, where about half of its 5 million players live.

Photograph: AP    China\u2019s influence on Hollywood has been growing for some time, but many in Tinseltown believe the industry has reached a watershed moment. They predict that US studios may soon start making films just for a Chinese audience. Dalian Wanda \u2013 the Chinese conglomerate that owns Atletico Madrid football club, AMC Entertainment (the second-largest cinema chain in the US), as well as Wanda Cinema Line, the biggest chain in China \u2013 snapped up US film studio Legendary Entertainment for $3.5bn at the beginning of the year. Wanda is controlled by China\u2019s richest man, Wang Jianlin, who has an estimated fortune of $27bn. It is the first Chinese group to own a major Hollywood studio. \u201cWanda Cinema already has made tremendous development in China, but it isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Wang. \u201cMovies are global, and our company certainly wants to add its voice to the world film market.\u201d Legendary has produced several big-budget blockbusters, including the Dark Knight trilogy, Jurassic World and the Hangover franchise. Crucially, it was also behind Warcraft. The marriage of Legendary\u2019s film-making experience with Wanda\u2019s giant network of cinemas brings the prospect of Hollywood blockbusters being made specifically for China a lot nearer. Jeff Bock, of research firm Exhibitor Relations, summed up the thoughts of many pundits: \u201cWarcraft is a juggernaut in China, but was a non-event in North America. What if they didn\u2019t even attempt a domestic [US] release with the sequel?\u201d The power of the Chinese market to make or break a film is now so great that Hollywood has already started to tailor its films to that audience.     Iron Man 3 altered its storyline so as not to offend Chinese audiences. Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar    Superhero film Dr Strange, out later this year, had to change a key character from Tibetan to European in order to avoid causing offence. In 2013, Iron Man 3, the story of what was once a Chinese-born villain was also altered; and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson has just signed to star in Skyscraper, a version of Die Hard set in China. The message for Hollywood\u2019s money men is clear \u2013 if you play nicely, you will be handed the keys to a market of 1.4\u00a0billion potential cinemagoers, who are forecast to spend $15bn by 2020. Such huge potential rewards have attracted investors like A-listers to a red carpet. After the Wanda deal, Tang Media Partners, created by businessman Donald Tang and backed by Chinese internet firm Tencent, bought IM Global, a Hollywood film financier and sales agency. The deal also involved China Media Capital (CMC), owned by media mogul Li Ruigang, and film production company Huayi Brothers. CMC\u2019s Li has also done deals with Warner Bros, and state-controlled operator Hunan TV &amp; Broadcast has invested in Lionsgate, the studio behind The Hunger Games and TV smash Mad Men. Tang believes that rising demand for Chinese-themed content will result in two of the six major US studios being Chinese-owned within 10 years. Investors from the People\u2019s Republic have stepped up moves to cash in on the increased spending power of a burgeoning middle class, whose per capita income has risen 20-fold in a generation. Evidence from box office receipts suggests the appetite for cinema has defied the slowing economy, and some see the Chinese movie market as having significant growth potential. At present, the Chinese market is worth almost $8bn, and growing. It is set to overtake the US next year as the world\u2019s biggest box office, according to the Hollywood Reporter. That may not seem too surprising for a large country with increasing levels of wealth. But it has achieved this at a time when China\u2019s State Administration of Press, Publication, Film and Television allows only 34 foreign-made films to open in the country each year. This strict quota, along with the threat of censorship, means that not all American blockbusters are given a crack at this giant market \u2013 and it also means that studios have to choose which films they want to place there.     A cinema audience in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    Under Wanda\u2019s ownership, Legendary should have a better chance of its films being screened in China \u2013 not least because it owns Wanda Cinema Line. Owning both a production studio and cinema chain is a vertical business model that was outlawed in the US on competition grounds in a landmark 1948 case against Paramount Pictures \u2013 which led to the demise of the classic Hollywood studio system. But this integrated content and distribution model was a boon for Warcraft. The film appearing on 67% of China\u2019s 39,000 cinema screens, with screenings scheduled through the night to satisfy demand. Zeng Maojun, president of Wanda Cinema Line, says China is adding 15 screens a day and reckons the number in the country could double to as many as 80,000. With booming box office receipts and increased control of both the production and the distribution of Hollywood films, it is difficult to see how anything can halt the momentum of China\u2019s movie juggernaut. Jackie Chan, the high-kicking martial arts film star, summed up the shift at last month\u2019s Shanghai film festival. \u201cWarcraft made 600m yuan (\u00a364m) in two days,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has scared the Americans. If we can make a film that earns 10bn yuan (\u00a31bn), then people from all over the world who want to study film will learn Chinese, instead of us having to learn English.\u201d TOP 10 IN CHINA Yuan, billions THE MERMAID 3.391MONSTER HUNT 2.439FURIOUS 7 2.426TRANSFORMERS 4 1.977MOJIN: THE LOST LEGEND 1.682LOST IN HONG KONG 1.613ZOOTOPIA 1.530AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON 1.464WARCRAFT 1.463GOODBYE MR LOSER 1.441 Source: China Boxoffice ", "tags": ["Travel & leisure", "Business", "Film industry", "World of Warcraft", "Warcraft", "Film", "China"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-02T15:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jul/06/month-in-comics-dc-rebirth-lumberjanes-gotham-academy-sherlock", "sentences": ["There are still some intriguing ideas to come, though, notably the introduction of Shanghai-based teen Kenan Kong, who will debut as a new \u201cSuper-Man\u201d in two weeks."], "title": "The month in comics: DC reboots its superhero slate", "article": "  Related: DC Rebirth: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman get rebooted \u2026 again    The last time DC overhauled its entire comics range, in 2011, it was an exercise in subtraction. Characters such as Superman, Wonder Woman and The Flash were made young, fresh and new by hacking back the messy tangle of mythology that had grown around them over decades. Continuity \u2013 the accumulated baggage of all those formative stories, perky kid sidekicks, romantic dalliances and sometimes regrettable costume updates \u2013 was suddenly anathema. It was right there in the campaign\u2019s title: the New 52. Now, after five years of slimmed-down stories, DC last month slammed the reboot button again with Rebirth, a restructuring of its entire slate of superhero titles. If the New 52 hoped to lure the time-poor by boiling characters down to bullet points, DC Rebirth is more in tune with the current trend for longreads. All that old, daft DC continuity is back in play, with one notable addition so audacious it almost feels like a wind-up: in the pages of DC Universe Rebirth, a beefy 80-page sizzle reel for the new status quo, it was revealed that the paranoiac world of Watchmen \u2013 Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019s caustic deconstruction of superhero tropes published by DC in the 1980s \u2013 has been folded into DC\u2019s masterplan. Now, theoretically, its characters could team up with the Justice League.   Related: Why it's time for the X-Men franchise to mutate    The entire New 52 era has even been explained as a cosmic blip caused by Watchmen\u2019s balls-out blue demigod Doctor Manhattan messing with alternate realities. This is a bold strategy, not least because Moore has a famously antagonistic relationship with DC. But it also threatens to overshadow the rest of the generally solid Rebirth project, which repositions Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash, Green Arrow and Supergirl so that they align better with DC\u2019s various TV and movie projects. There are still some intriguing ideas to come, though, notably the introduction of Shanghai-based teen Kenan Kong, who will debut as a new \u201cSuper-Man\u201d in two weeks. And the rougher edges have not been smoothed off entirely: Brit wizard Constantine does still call mossy golem Swamp Thing a \u201cbloody turnip\u201d.     Lumberjanes meet Gotham Academy. Photograph: Boom! Studios    Cross-universe collisions are nothing new. 2000AD\u2019s Judge Dredd butted heads with Batman back in the 1990s, while the original crew of the USS Enterprise beamed down to the Planet Of The Apes last year in an IDW/Boom Studios comics crossover (entitled, brilliantly, The Primate Directive). Boom has now teamed up with DC for Lumberjanes/Gotham Academy, a six-part series by writer Chynna Clugston-Flores and artist Rosemary Valero-O\u2019Connell that combines two outlier comics into one cultish whole. The Lumberjanes are five girl bunkmates at a peculiar, possibly eternal, summer camp next to a forest full of danger. At Gotham Academy, the faculty includes reformed C-list Batman villains and a secret gang of student detectives who solve mysteries between classes. When one a teacher vanishes without trace, the Academy crew end up on a road trip to Lumberjanes country where their sleuthing disturbs a sinister cabal of animal-skulled cenobites. Bringing together all these plucky, precocious kids for a Goonies-style adventure is a smart move, and it makes a refreshing change to read a comic where two sets of characters meeting for the first time don\u2019t immediately have a massive fight.     Sherlock: A Study In Pink, Titan Comics.

Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss\u2019s modern-day TV refit Sherlock was turned into a Japanese manga back in 2012 and canny UK publisher Titan recently launched an English translation as an ongoing monthly series.

When I checked the e-tickets a couple of weeks later I realised I had added an extra letter to my friend\u2019s surname. BudgetAir said that to correct it I needed to cancel my plane ticket and buy a new one, which would leave me \u00a3230 out of pocket. I thought this was a big price to pay, so I contacted the airline in \u00adquestion, Hainan Airlines.  It said it would change the name free of charge if I had booked through it directly, but since I used BudgetAir only the latter could amend the ticket.  How can BudgetAir justify such a huge cost if the airline does not charge a fee? CM, United Arab Emirates Airlines and travel agents are \u00adnotoriously unforgiving of typos. Last year, a student changed his name by deed poll because it cost less than half the \u00a3220 Ryanair demanded to amend the surname his girlfriend\u2019s stepfather had mistakenly used in a booking.  The official line is that it covers administration and deters passengers from selling on tickets at a profit. The cynical might note that it boosts profits shaved by cut-price tickets.  Your case is complicated by the fact that although your flight number belongs to Hainan Airlines, the flight is operated by Etihad Airways. It\u2019s known as code sharing.  BudgetAir tells me that both airlines initially said that the booking would have to be cancelled for a fee of $250 (\u00a3185) and a new ticket purchased, on top of which Budget would levy a \u00a355 \u201cservice fee\u201d. Then Hainan Airlines decided that it could process the amendment free of charge, whereas Etihad Airways declined. Happily, BudgetAir has now \u00adrealised the absurdity of the situation.

The first time was last Saturday, when Sam Querrey knocked out Novak Djokovic. The second on Friday, when Milos Raonic did likewise to Roger Federer. This is Murray\u2019s 42nd grand slam, his 20th semi, and will be his 11th final. But it is the very first in which he has not had one or more of Djokovic, Federer or Rafa Nadal between him and victory. In 17 of the 23 grand slams he has played since 2010, Murray was beaten by one of those three. Two of the others, he won as an underdog. Now, for the first time in his life, Murray is the clear favourite. Which could play out one of two ways. Either he will relish the opportunity, or be so anxious to grab it that he ends up letting it slip.   Related: Andy Murray reaches Wimbledon final with straight-sets win over Berdych    You never know how you will handle the pressure until it comes down on your head. But in the three games he has played in the past six days, Murray has given a clear idea that it suits him just fine. You could see it in the way he shut out Nick Kyrgios in straight sets on Monday, and again when he fought his way through a fifth set against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Wednesday, and most especially on Friday, when he hammered Tomas Berdych in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, in two minutes under two hours of play. Berdych, still bruised, touched on it when he came off court. \u201cI think he can [win],\u201d Berdych said. \u201cDefinitely he can. The fact that probably his biggest rival, Novak, is not in the draw any more definitely helps him. I think he has all the tools to make it.\u201d For the second time in three days, Murray found himself following Federer on to Centre Court after a five-set epic. So again, then, Murray had the unusual experience of playing the first few games in front of a lot of empty seats. But where the atmosphere had felt a little flat during the first set of his quarter-final against Tsonga, this time those who had stayed behind were alive with anticipation. Murray was already fancied to win the title, but with Federer out the odds had just been chopped again. Now, for the first time in living memory, the crowd on Centre Court found itself supporting a home player who was an overwhelming favourite to win the championship. An alien sensation for them, then, as it was for the man himself.   Related: Andy Murray beats Tsonga in five-set thriller to reach Wimbledon semi-finals    They and he soon seemed to grow used to it. There were no jokes from the crowd, no cries of \u201cC\u2019mon Tim\u201d, or chortles when someone popped a champagne cork. Only earnest roars of support. Berdych reached the final here in 2010, and has been a fixture in the top 10 ever since. But even he seemed to find it a little intimidating. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different story,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing at home with all the crowd support behind him.\u201d Murray led him 8-6 in their head to head. But then Federer had an even better record, 9-2, against Raonic. So his defeat wasn\u2019t only an opportunity for Murray, but a reminder that in this sport those stats do not always count, that you can take nothing for granted. Not that Murray necessarily needed the extra incentive. There has been an edge to this rivalry ever since Berdych employed Murray\u2019s old coach and friend, Dani Vallverdu. Before that Berdych had also tried to hire Murray\u2019s current coach, Ivan Lendl.   Related: Milos Raonic beats Roger Federer in five sets to reach Wimbledon final    Things boiled over in their memorable match in the semi-finals of the Australian Open last year when Murray reported Berdych to the umpire, and Kim, his fiancee at the time, swore a blue streak, after Berdych won the first set tie-break. Murray went on to win that match 6-7, 6-0, 6-3, 7-5. And he has now beaten Berdych again in all of the matches they have played since: in Miami, Shanghai, and Madrid, all four victories in straight sets, and without the need for a single tie-break. Murray has, of course, been quick and keen to downplay the press\u2019s suggestions that there is any lingering animosity between the two men, who once considered themselves pretty close friends. But there\u2019s a suspicion that he was only being a diplomatic about it, and those who know suggest that there was no way in hell Murray was going to allow himself to lose to Berdych, least of all in a grand slam semi-final. And it said plenty that he made only nine unforced errors in the match. He explained that he felt his experience told, that all those matches against Djokovic and Federer had put him in the best possible position to take advantage of their absence. \u201cHaving had those experiences in the past has helped me a lot, playing against some of the best players of all time.\u201d It seems he has been waiting for this chance.", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Wimbledon 2016", "Tomas Berdych", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-08T18:47:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/09/boeing-airbus-cancellations-delays-farnborough-airliner", "sentences": ["There is talk that the US company is honing designs for a mid-range plane seating between 200 and 270 people to whisk passengers from London to New York, Sydney to Shanghai or Dubai to Oslo."], "title": "Cancellations and delays expected in airliner market at Farnborough", "article": "Brexit looms over David Cameron\u2019s visit to this week\u2019s Farnborough air show, as airlines and plane manufacturers fasten their belts for a bumpy few years of economic turbulence. The prime minister is scheduled to visit the show on Monday, and assurances about Britain\u2019s future trading links with the rest of the world, including the European Union, are sure to be near the top of the agenda. The biennial aerospace jamboree is usually peppered with eyecatching orders for the latest jetliners, which provide a handy barometer of global economic confidence. Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic looks set to sign a $4.3bn deal to buy up to 12 A350 wide-bodied jets from Airbus, while the European plane maker\u2019s American rival, Boeing, will confirm an order for around 10 747 jumbo jets with Russia\u2019s largest air freight company, worth about $4bn. These marquee deals will be trumpeted loudly. But, after several years of bumper plane orders, analysts reckon the atmosphere among captains of the aero industry and their sales executives will be relatively muted as worries grow about the state of the global economy in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU. One analyst said: \u201cA sudden ripple has gone through the market after Brexit. We\u2019ve got no idea about the impact of Brexit at the moment.\u201d Industry sources expect Branson to attend this week\u2019s show to sign the Airbus deal. It is thought Virgin wants to buy eight A350-1000 jetliners and take purchase options on a further four to replace its remaining Boeing 747s. Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, last month said that a decision on the new jets was \u201cimminent\u201d. The deal might enable Virgin to cancel its now-unwanted order for Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbo. Several other airlines are in the final stages of choosing between the A350 and its rival, Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner, including Emirates and Oman Air. European airlines are expected to have a quiet show. The uncertainty that has enveloped the EU since Britain voted to leave has already sparked profit warnings from British carriers such as easyJet and International Airlines Group, owner of British Airways. In addition, a low oil price has not only eased the financial burden on carriers, but has also curbed their need to buy new fuel-efficient planes to replace ageing fleets.     A Boeing 787 Dreamliner belonging to the Polish airline LOT. Photograph: East News/REX Shutterstock    Tom Enders, chief executive of Airbus, has warned the EU vote was \u201ca lose-lose result\u201d for Britain and Europe. His view matters because Airbus makes all of its wings at Broughton in north Wales. \u201cBritain will suffer, but I\u2019m sure it will focus even more now on the competitiveness of its economy vis-a-vis the EU and the world at large,\u201d Enders said, warning: \u201cBut of course we will review our UK investment strategy, like everybody else will.\u201d Airbus goes into this week\u2019s show lagging behind its arch-rival, after ending the first half of the year with 227 aircraft orders, or 183 after deducting cancellations. Boeing sold 309 aircraft, or 276 after cancellations. The figures clearly show demand for aircraft falling compared with the first half of last year, which included the Paris air show, held every other year in June. In 2015, Airbus booked 1,036 net commercial plane orders, down from 1,456 a year earlier, but it outsold Boeing, which booked 768 net orders last year. Boeing has lost ground to its European rival in the giant market for short-haul planes. There is talk that the US company is honing designs for a mid-range plane seating between 200 and 270 people to whisk passengers from London to New York, Sydney to Shanghai or Dubai to Oslo. The mid-market jetliner would fill the gap between Boeing\u2019s largest single-aisle model, the 737, and its smallest wide-body, the 787. It is a relatively untapped market but one where Airbus is starting to extend its reach. Mike Delaney, general manager of aircraft development at Boeing, recently said it was a case of \u201cwhen\u201d, not \u201cif\u201d, regarding the prospects for a new plane. He is confident Boeing is on the verge of a breakthrough, following discussions with 36 carriers about a replacement for the out-of-production 757. The aircraft would cost at least $10bn to produce and Boeing\u2019s top brass want to ensure the economics stack up before giving it the green light.

Welcome to the hi-tech off-grid communities", "article": "\u201cIf you look at any long lasting eco-village, it has usually been about religion, polyamory or drugs,\u201d says James Ehrlich, president of Netherlands-based ReGen Villages, who wants to build sustainable communities for the  21st century. \u201cThose things are all great in their own way \u2026 but we want to express innovation and excitement. Traditional eco-village people wait for 50 years for that one tree to fall so they can build their community centre. I don\u2019t think the planet has the time to wait. We have to build off-grid neighbourhoods around the world as quickly as we can, and as many as we can.\u201d Since revealing plans for their modern eco-village at the Venice Biennale at the end of May, ReGen Villages and architectural partners EFFEKT say they have seen a \u201cfirestorm\u201d of viral activity and 6,500 interested emails. \u201cWhat they are saying is: \u2018We want in desperately: this is our dream,\u2019\u201d says California-based Ehrlich.  \u201cWe\u2019re getting emails from PhD [students], family members, older couples who want to downsize with their friends \u2026 communities of people reaching out to us because they see we have essentially done the homework for them.\u201d That homework involves combining the most modern technologies to build a circle of homes in a closed-loop system that produces its own solar and biogas power, grows organic vegetables, farms fish and chickens, harvests water and recycles waste into fertiliser. Homes, enclosed in greenhouses to \u201cextend the warm season\u201d, will start at \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3170,000) plus about \u20ac500 (\u00a3425) a month for food and services. Already, 1,200 people are on the waiting list.     Illustration of the ReGen circular system.

It will start building its first 100 homes in Almere Oosterwold in the eastern Netherlands this summer, aiming to raise \u20ac25m (\u00a321m) from private investors and sovereign wealth funds (who will be promised a return). It is planning projects in Denmark and northern Europe, then hopes to create designs for every climate. Although Ehrich is a Stanford University academic, and the architectural firm EFFEKT is Danish, ReGen Villages is based in the Netherlands thanks to a rapturous Dutch welcome and a reputation for innovative housing projects. Tjeerd Herrema, head of housing at Almere council, explained it is letting a new area develop by allowing people and collectives to build their own neighbourhoods and infrastructure (with a few ground rules). \u201cWe want to develop part of Almere in a completely different way, so people can decide their own future,\u201d he said. \u201cReGen Villages want to produce their own food, energy, planning their own land, buildings and homes using the latest technology. That project fitted seamlessly into the philosophy for Oosterwold. \u201cThis is an experiment. Normally, government has a plan for an area, but we\u2019ve turned that upside down. It\u2019s a kind of reaction to the crisis we\u2019ve just come from, which caused so much disappointment in our institutions and banks.\u201d Sinus Lynge, co-founder of EFFEKT architects, believes this suburban development in Oosterwold is just the start of de-urbanisation. \u201cIt makes a lot of sense to look at being self-sufficient in a village, in intensive modules, or in an area that is being deserted,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the most intense inner city areas like Shanghai or London, to give space to food is unthinkable.     There will be plenty of space to grow food. Photograph: EFFEKT/ReGen    \u201cThere\u2019s also a huge wave of people who want to reconnect. The idea of knowing where your food comes from is one [way], and in Denmark there\u2019s a huge movement of people wanting to work less and spend more time with their families: this could be an opportunity.\u201d Dr Frank Suurenbroek, professor of urban transformation at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, says the Netherlands has a history of radical housing developments, most recently driven by ideas around sustainability \u2013 but that developers need to maintain a sense of reality. \u201cA possible field of tension is how the technological demands of sustainability and circularity [interact with] spatial configurations needed to create attractive places and the desire to create new houses fast,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth worlds have to learn how to connect. Experiments with new sustainable quarters are interesting and needed, but a major issue is how to do this within existing built areas.\u201d This is absolutely logical for Marlies Rohmer, the architect behind a 2011 complex of floating houses in the manmade islands of IJburg, near Amsterdam. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suit everyone, but they are great in the Netherlands for former harbours, where the infrastructure is there, parking is not a problem and you have a very good public traffic system,\u201d she said.     Floating homes in IJburg. Photograph: Marlies Rohmer Architects &amp; Urbanists    Her architecture firm is set to work on a floating village with the firm Carillion Igloo Genesis in Royal Victoria Docks in London, and she added that the surprising thing is how broadly attractive such homes have proven in the Netherlands: \u201cWe thought this is housing for young urban people but strangely people with children started to go there, attracted by an outside location. I\u2019ve never seen such a mixed population.\u201d Sustainable innovation may be threatened now that the Dutch housing market is booming, though, according to architect Matthijs Bouw. He has worked with another experimental, self-build community in Amsterdam\u2019s Buiksloterham, using digital technology to coordinate elements like building a waste management system. \u201cPart of [the motivation] is a culture of self-building and innovation, and part of it is driven by the Dutchman as trader, getting rid of the middleman to get better results for less money,\u201d he reflected. \u201cBut the Dutch are fickle. With the changing real estate economy, there\u2019s an incredible urgency to build houses and Amsterdam has tended to return to the old models.\u201d Back at Almere, though, Ehrlich can\u2019t wait to meet an \u201cebb and flow\u201d of varied residents when the first 25 homes are completed in early 2017. Some of the smallest inhabitants, it turns out, will be soldier flies, great at breaking down compost and a food source for fish and chickens. \u201cThey are also edible for humans, for people who are interested in that,\u201d he confides, \u201cand protein-delicious with butter and garlic.\u201d", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Housing", "Communities", "Society", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Netherlands", "Renewable energy", "Life and style"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-12T04:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/12/urban-sprawl-how-cities-grow-change-sustainability-urban-age", "sentences": ["There are 103 road intersections per sq km \u2013 high compared to Brasilia\u2019s 41 or Shanghai\u2019s Pudong area, which has only 17."], "title": "The curse of urban sprawl: how cities grow, and why this has to change", "article": "I have just spent two days in Barcelona, one of the most densely populated urban settlements in the world. There are 103 road intersections per sq km \u2013 high compared to Brasilia\u2019s 41 or Shanghai\u2019s Pudong area, which has only 17. Yet despite these high densities, residents of Barcelona will tell you how profoundly liveable their city is.  Visitors are charmed by the pedestrianised streets that thread their way through a maze of buildings constructed over the centuries \u2013 between four and seven storeys high, on narrow streets leading to piazzas where people sit at cafe tables or under shady trees. Many residents walk or cycle to work, and public transport functions very well. For the first time in human history, most of us live in urban settlements \u2013 from megacities of 10-20 million, of which there were 28 in 2014, to medium-sized cities of 1-5 million (417 in 2014), and smaller settlements (525 of between 500,000 and one million people in 2014). Looking ahead, the biggest growth will occur not in megacities but these small- and medium-sized cities. Metropolises expand and contract. It is estimated that 40% of Europe\u2019s cities are shrinking (though this is a trend that migration might help to reverse). Even in Africa, there are some countries where the percentage of the total population living in cities has declined at various times over the past two decades.  Overall, however, our current urban population of around 3.9 billion is expected to grow to around 6.34 billion by 2050, out of a total global population of at least 9.5 billion. If we continue to design and build as if the planet can provide unlimited resources, then this near-doubling of the urban population will mean a doubling of the natural resources required to build and operate our cities \u2013 which is not sustainable.     The Eixample district in Barcelona, one of the most densely populated cities. Photograph: Amos Chapple/Rex    As cities grow, perhaps our most serious concern should be how they expand out into the surrounding countryside. Contrary to popular belief, over the past century urban settlements have not only expanded demographically, they have also sprawled outwards \u2013 covering some of the world\u2019s most valuable farmland in the process.    Continued urbanisation in its current form could threaten global food supplies    The result has been a steady de-densification of urban settlements, by about \u20132% per annum. Even where inner-city areas have densified over the past few decades (Copenhagen, for example), the citywide trend is still for an overall reduction in average densities. In 2010, the total area covered by all the cement, asphalt, compacted clay, park areas and open spaces that comprise the footprint of the world\u2019s urban settlements was around 1 million sq km. In comparison, the total area of France is 643,000 sq km. If the urban population and long-term de-densification trends continue, the area of the planet covered by urban settlements will increase to more than 3 million sq km by 2050. And since the most intensively cultivated farmland is typically located near where the bulk of the food is consumed, much of this additional 2 million sq km is currently our most productive farmland. In short, continued urbanisation in its current form could threaten global food supplies at a time when food production is already not keeping up with population growth. Understanding rapid urbanisation A key determinant of rampant urban sprawl \u2013 especially in North America, where it is a particularly serious problem \u2013 has been the existence of cheap oil. When oil prices reached record highs in 2008 and exacerbated the global economic crisis, the people who travelled furthest tended to be the first to default on their mortgage payments. As their fuel expenses for travelling to work and school rocketed, so their capacity to afford urban sprawl drastically diminished. Visiting Detroit a few weeks ago, I found that of the city\u2019s 300,000 buildings, 70,000 currently stand empty \u2013 and mostly derelict.     Of Detroit\u2019s 300,000-odd buildings, an estimated 70,000 currently stand empty. Photograph: James Cheadle/Alamy    From the 1960s onwards, the city built more and more ring roads to suburbanise the middle and upper classes into the surrounding countryside \u2013 and in the process bankrupted Detroit\u2019s urban core, leaving it unable to manage the economic impact of the closure of its once-giant car factories. Indeed, most of the extra 2.5 billion people who will be living in urban areas by 2050 will be in cities of the global south, in particular in Asia and Africa; 37% of all future urban growth is expected to take place in only three countries: China, India and Nigeria. Other than in China, rapid urbanisation in these developing counties has resulted in an explosion of informal urban settlements, or slums. In India, millions of slum-dwellers live within the core urban areas, creating the fairly unique Indian phenomenon of neighbourhoods where the urban poor and middle class live together.  By contrast, in African cities \u2013 where 62% of all urbanites are in slums \u2013 the majority of slum-dwellers live in expanding urban settlements on the peripheries of cities. With Africa\u2019s urban population (currently around 400 million people) expected to triple to 1.2 billion by 2050, this form of urbanisation will result in massive, sprawling, relatively low-density urban settlements across the continent.      Conflicts of an urban age: Slum conditions have changed in Addis Ababa over the last 25 years, with fewer wooden and mud constructions. Source: Urban Age/LSE Cities    But it\u2019s not happening like this everywhere. Take Ethiopia, an east African country of 99 million people with one of the fastest growing economies in the world. While 80% of the population is still rural, urbanisation is accelerating fast, placing huge pressures on the capital, Addis Ababa.  Government investments have turned this city into a massive building site. Endless cranes are silhouetted against the African sky as a huge number of relatively high-rise buildings emerge in the urban core. At the same time, with funds and expertise provided by the Chinese, a light-rail system has been built that runs across the city \u2013 a remarkable feat in a city where 80% of the population lives in slums. This creates incentives for the middle class to live in high-density, multi-storey apartments that are starting to spring up around the stations \u2013 reducing the need to subsidise longer-distance, road-based travel by private car. Coupled with the building of multi-storey, subsidised housing for the urban poor (some located close to transit nodes), the result is that Addis Ababa is densifying, setting an example for what is possible in other cities facing similar challenges. Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa, provides a very different \u2013 but also promising \u2013 case study. Under apartheid, the urban poor were forcibly relocated into outer-city settlements \u2013 often located between five and 40km from the urban periphery. Many of these turned into slums as population numbers far exceeded what these settlements were designed to accommodate. After democratisation in 1994, there was a major inward flow of people into the urban core that could not be accommodated, despite a massive housing construction programme. Land invasions took place in all South African cities, including on inner-city land. Johannesburg\u2019s metropolitan government realised it could not build an integrated city by moving millions of people around, because so many already lived in formal townships. Instead, it identified a set of strategically located urban development hotspots, and then invested in mass transit services to link them together. The aim is to rapidly intensify job and residential densities in these development hotspots, thus increasing the number of people who can access publicly funded mass-transit services.     In Addis Ababa, increasing urbanisation has seen public housing decrease from 57% to 40% of total stock between 1990 and 2015. Source: Urban Age/LSE Cities    This will increase average densities over time, and integrate the city via transit rather than expensive residential relocations. This, coupled with strategies to upgrade informal settlements rather than building new houses on the peripheries, has contributed significantly to enhancing densification, rather than encouraging the sprawl promoted by Johannesburg\u2019s property developers and banks since 1994. There is no doubt that sprawling, de-densifying cities are a major threat to the future sustainability of the planet. Neither the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals nor the Paris agreement\u2019s climate targets will be achieved if this challenge is not addressed \u2013 but it means going up against property developers who tend to prefer greenfield developments on the peripheries to the complexities of brownfield regeneration. Towards liveable urban settlements Across the world, it would be a mistake to focus solely on improving the average densities of cities. Los Angeles has a higher average density than New York, for example, yet LA is regarded as a dysfunctional urban form while NY is functional, because it comprises a network of high-density neighbourhoods interconnected by efficient and affordable mass transit systems. Seoul is similar: a megacity that has avoided sprawl with this approach. When the mayor decided to dismantle the eight-lane highway that used to run through the centre of the city, he said: \u201cSeoul is for people, not cars.\u201d     Although Seoul has a population of more than 10 million, it has avoided sprawling outwards. Photograph: Alamy    An alternative road was not built \u2013 resulting in an increase in the number of people using mass transit which, in turn, made mass transit financially viable. Building more highways for cars, then introducing trains and buses in the hope that they will be financially viable, simply does not work (the greater Johannesburg region is learning that lesson now).  China, meanwhile, has urbanised hundreds of millions of people over the past three decades. This has tended to be in high-rise, multi-storey buildings located in \u201csuperblocks\u201d with wide, traffic-congested streets and few intersections per sq km. The result is relatively low densities in neighbourhoods with virtually no street or community life \u2013 in short, not the kind of urban area one would call liveable. Compare this with the neighbourhoods you find in Barcelona, where buildings are five to eight storeys high, located on narrow streets with pavements, trees and small piazzas for social engagement, and all well connected to both motorised and non-motorised forms of transport.   Related: The rise and fall of great world cities: 5,700 years of urbanisation \u2013 mapped    This is what makes for liveable urban neighbourhoods. China has realised its mistake, adopting an urbanisation strategy that breaks away from sprawled-out superblocks in favour of a high-density neighbourhood approach, with narrower streets, a high number of intersections, and improved public transport. While the population of the world\u2019s cities will likely double in size between now and 2050, rising oil prices and carbon constraints make urban sprawl increasingly untenable. Eradicating it in favour of liveable, accessible, multi-centred, high-density cities should become a shared global commitment.

Naturally, Rodgers was clear about his plans for the club: \u201cTo continue with the domination of Scotland and also make an impact on European football.\u201d Verily, he is a man of his word, because this very day, because of him, millions upon millions of simple citizens are enjoying the most powerful emotion of all: maniacal, catatonic, corporeal laughter, the mere mention of the name Queen\u2019s Celtic enough to turn an entire continent incontinent. Such is the power of Brendan.   Related: Brendan Rodgers not embarrassed despite Celtic defeat to Lincoln Red Imps    Prior to the game against the mighty Lincoln Red Imps, Brendan was open as to his plans, pledging to \u201ctreat them the same as if we were playing Barcelona or Real Madrid\u201d. So it was said and so it was done, the arch motivator inspiring his team to roll over in supine compliance with the effortless brilliance that has become his hallmark. Nor will the significance of the winning goal be lost on the green and white army. Its scorer, Lee Casciaro, is, when not scoring winning goals against the Queen\u2019s Celtic, a Gibraltarian policeman. Or, put another way, yet another example of the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers exerting their malign influence over the cosmos; it just isn\u2019t fair. As for Brendan, he was contrite as ever, quick to accept full responsibility for his side\u2019s failure, which he attributed to the pitch, the weather, the opposing team, his own team, and the policy process in the modern capitalist state. But he absolutely did not find it \u201cembarrassing\u201d to be beaten by a team of part-timers, thereby returning the worst result in his team\u2019s proud 128-year history, and at the first attempt, too; rather, it was just \u201cdisappointing\u201d. He then went on to accuse his players of being overtired and showing off to their friends. In response, those players have made it clear that under no circumstances did they ask to be born.

Today\u2019s visitors to the spacious, western-style building, opened in 2003, could be forgiven for missing the significance of the name. He Luting was a composer who was also director of the conservatory from 1949. As Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution gathered force, He Luting came under attack for his writings on Debussy. In 1968, after two years of violence and humiliation, he was dragged before television cameras by Red Guards to be threatened and physically abused. By this time, there had been a wave of suicides at the conservatory, as students turned on teachers and on each other. He Luting, however, refused to submit. Two weeks later, dragged back for a rerun, he shouted to his persecutors, live on television, \u201cShame on you for lying.\u201d   Related: Madeleine Thien: \u2018In China, you learn a lot from what people don\u2019t tell you\u2019    He Luting\u2019s defiance was a moment of resistance in the savage history that features prominently in Canadian novelist Madeleine Thien\u2019s powerful third novel, along with the events two decades later surrounding the Tiananmen Square protests. History matters in China. For more than 60 years, the historical narrative has been manipulated or suppressed in the service of the shifting needs of the regime\u2019s politics. Writing the wrong sort of history \u2013 one that deviates from the party line \u2013 can still get you into trouble. Thien takes this history and weaves it into a vivid, magisterial novel that reaches back to China\u2019s civil war and up to the present day. At its heart are the interlocking fates of a set of characters who live for and by music, until their world is destroyed by the events the revolution unleashes. Her story begins in Vancouver, where the narrator, known by both her Chinese name Li-ling and her English name Marie, lives with her mother. Her father, she tells us, disappeared some years earlier, and in 1989, when Marie was 10, he killed himself in Hong Kong at the age of 39. That same year, a teenage relative appeared from China: Ai Ming, a young woman forced to flee following the brutal suppression of the student occupation of Tiananmen Square. Gradually, tracking back and forth across more than seven decades of history, Marie assembles the story of her father and his profound but troubled relationship with members of Ai Ming\u2019s family. The story is uncovered with difficulty \u2013 Marie barely speaks or reads Chinese, and the events and characters are buried beneath layers of forgetting. It is pieced together from the fragments of a set of notebooks brought to Canada from China. The novel\u2019s characters have copied and recopied into these notebooks a story entitled \u201cHistorical Records\u201d, the origins of which remain obscure. The notebooks serve as both a narrative device and a metaphor for a history that can neither be remembered nor forgotten. The title of the manuscript is an allusion to China\u2019s most celebrated work of history, Sima Qian\u2019s Historical Records, completed in 91BCE but kept hidden for fear of the wrath of an emperor who had had its author castrated. The telling of history in China was always a dangerous occupation. As Ai Ming and Marie grow close, Marie discovers that her father, Jiang Kai, had been the only one of his family to survive the starvation that resulted from Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and early 60s; that he was a talented concert pianist; and that he was friends with Ai Ming\u2019s father, Sparrow, a gifted composer and his teacher at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Marie learns, too, about the earlier generations of the family, including Ai Ming\u2019s great aunt and grandmother \u2013 Swirl and Big Mother \u2013 who, as teenage sisters in the 1940s, made a living as itinerant teahouse singers. When Swirl and her husband were sent to labour camps in the 50s, Big Mother brought up their daughter, Zhuli, who grows into a dedicated violinist. The lives of these earlier generations revolve around the Shanghai Conservatory, until the Cultural Revolution shatters everything. The music they love becomes cause for persecution, but continues to run through their heads as they try to hold on to meaning and to love, despite the chaos, grief, betrayal and violence. The fragile dreams of Thien\u2019s characters run in counterpoint to the disordered cruelty of Maoist politics, with Glenn Gould\u2019s two recordings of Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations running through the novel like a soundtrack of suffering and redemption. This is a moving and extraordinary evocation of the 20th-century tragedy of China, and deserves to cement Thien\u2019s reputation as an important and compelling writer. \u2022 To order Do Not Say We have Nothing for \u00a310.65 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Nico Gait\u00e1n\u2019s arrival from Benfica, for around \u00a319.7m, is their headline act and should add to their creative spark. Sime Vrsaljko, a Croatian right-back, looks a good addition from Sassuolo while the 19-year-old attacking midfielder Diogo Jota has arrived from Portuguese club Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira. The next-biggest money has been spent by Sevilla, who lost Grzegorz Krychowiak to Paris Saint-Germain but paid Sampdoria around \u00a311m for the Argentinian midfielder Joaqu\u00edn Correa. They have also signed the Hannover playmaker Hiroshi Kiyotake, a Japan international, for \u00a35.25m while another midfielder, Pablo Sarabia, has arrived from Getafe and the defender Mat\u00edas Kranevitter has come from Atl\u00e9tico on loan. All this aside, Portuguese former Manchester United wingers are the real must-have accessory. Nani will link up with Valencia after signing from Fenerbahce during that stellar Euro 2016 campaign, and Beb\u00e9 \u2013 remember him? \u2013 is still going strong too. He has joined Eibar on a four-year contract from Benfica after impressing on a season-long loan with relegated Rayo Vallecano. Serie A     Roma have signed the gifted 19-year-old attacking midfielder Gerson from Fluminense for around \u00a314m. Photograph: Luciano Rossi/AS Roma via Getty Images    In line with current market trends, dealings in Serie A have been relatively austere although Juventus have naturally led the way. Their \u00a325.4m signing of Miralam Pjanic from Roma has the effect of landing them an outstanding playmaker and weakening a rival team who finished 11 points behind them last season. Dani Alves, on a free transfer after leaving Barcelona, is the pre-season\u2019s highest-profile newcomer to the division for now, although the Bianconeri are likely to be in the market for a striker to replace Morata. Roma have been quick to spend some of the proceeds from that Pjanic sale, purchasing the gifted Fluminense attacking midfielder Gerson for around \u00a314m. Gerson is 19 but will be expected to make an impact alongside Stephan El Shaarawy, who has made his move from Milan permanent. Of the others hoping to run Juventus as close as possible next season, Napoli\u2019s only significant buy is the Empoli defender Lorenzo Tonelli \u2013 although they are closing in on the enigma that is Emanuele Giaccherini \u2013 while Internazionale have made permanent the signing of the former loanee Marcelo Brozovic, who impressed for Croatia at Euro 2016, and made an impressive free addition in the out-of-contract Sevilla schemer \u00c9ver Banega. Milan have paid \u00a37.65m for the striker Gianluca Lapadula, a sensation at newly promoted Pescara last season who earned an \u201cItalian Jamie Vardy\u201d tag, while among Fiorentina\u2019s arrivals is a famous surname. Ianis Hagi, son of Gheorghe, is 17 but big things are expected of the right winger after his move from the Romanian side Viitorul \u2013 owned and managed by his father. Crotone, who will play the first Serie A season in their history, have been picked off in a similar manner to Pescara, with Sampdoria signing the prolific striker Ante Budimir. On the whole, though, Serie A watches, waits and hopes to make use of the money that it receives from elsewhere. Bundesliga     The highly rated forward Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has joined Borussia Dortmund from Rennes. Photograph: Bernd Thissen/EPA    Bundesliga clubs have, relative to their colleagues in Spain and Italy, cut loose and Bayern Munich have naturally drawn their line in the sand early on. Mats Hummels officially returned at the start of July after seven years as a Borussia Dortmund player, bringing no small degree of ill will from BvB fans with him. Yet more exciting is the arrival of Renato Sanches, who confirmed his potential with Portugal at Euro 2016, from Benfica for an initial \u00a327.5m. That seems a bargain at this stage \u2013 but Sanches is not the only European wonderkid to be developing his education in the Bundesliga.   Related: Football League transfers: who has done the best business so far?    There is succour for Dortmund in the arrival of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, the much-vaunted 19-year-old forward from Rennes, and they are also pleased to have signed young Turkish winger Emre Mor from Nordsjaelland. Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro, the excellent Portugal left-back, has arrived from Lorient while Sebastian Rode has bucked the recent trend and joined from Bayern Munich. Marc Bartra, the Barcelona defender, is another high-profile arrival and these signings look deliberately targeted to offset the departures of Hummels, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan \u2013 the latter pair to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively. Schalke, meanwhile, have a bright young thing of their own. Breel Embolo, the Cameroon-born Switzerland forward, has pitched up for a reported \u00a320m. The towering defender Naldo\u2019s arrival on a free transfer from Wolfsburg looks canny business in its own way. There has also been heavy spending activity at Bayer Leverkusen, who have persuaded the forward Kevin Volland to join from Hoffenheim for around \u00a317m, while the Austrian international midfielder Julian Baumgartlinger has made the switch from Mainz. Leaving Leverkusen for a hefty fee of his own is another midfielder, Christoph Kramer, who returns to his former loan club Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach as a replacement for Arsenal-bound Granit Xhaka. Jannik Vestergaard, the former Werder Bremen centre-back, has joined Kramer there for a fee in the region of \u00a310m. Other notable business includes Yannick Gerhardt\u2019s move from Cologne to Wolfsburg, who have also signed the former Chelsea defender Jeffrey Bruma from PSV Eindhoven. Ligue 1     Grzegorz Krychowiak, right, in action here for Poland against Portugal at Euro 2016, has joined Paris St-Germain. Photograph: Alexander Demianchuk/Tass    Paris Saint-Germain may have lost Zlatan Ibrahimovic but they made a significant statement in signing the outstanding Poland midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Sevilla for a fee thought to be not far shy of \u00a330m. Thomas Meunier, the Belgium right-back, is another Euro 2016 success story to be setting down permanent roots in France \u2013 transferring from Club Brugge in his case \u2013 and then there is Hatem Ben Arfa, whose switch from Nice could go very, very well or quite the opposite. Monaco\u2019s addition of their own Pole, the centre-back Kamil Glik from across the Italian border at Torino, looks sage and much is expected too of the left-back Djibril Sidib\u00e9, whom they attracted from Lille despite the gimlet eye of Arsenal watching on. Young, talented left-backs seem to be the thing there \u2013 for Monaco have also shelled out for Marseille\u2019s Benjamin Mendy. For those who like to roll back the years, Radamel Falcao is back from his better-left-unmentioned two years on loan in the Premier League. Among a number of other big-name departures from Ligue 1 are the Marseille pair Michy Batshuayi and Steve Mandanda \u2013 to Chelsea and Crystal Palace respectively \u2013 along with Nice\u2019s Nampalys Mendy, who has joined Leicester. Elsewhere In Turkey, Fenerbahce have freshly snapped up Martin Skrtel from Liverpool, adding to the arrivals of Gregory van der Wiel and Schalke\u2019s Roman Neust\u00e4dter. The Turkish league has finally lost Alex Telles, though \u2013 he has signed for Porto from Galatasaray, having played on loan at Inter last year. Porto have also made permanent the signing of Miguel Lay\u00fan from Watford and signed the lively Jo\u00e3o Teixeira from Liverpool. Russia is not the popular pay-packet destination it once was, but CSKA Moscow have replaced the new Leicester signing Ahmed Musa with Lacina Traor\u00e9, on loan from Monaco. Rubin Kazan\u2019s signing of the Belgium winger Maxime Lestienne from the Qatari club Al-Arabi raised an eyebrow or two, but big moves have generally been thin on the ground and the departure of Hulk from Zenit St Petersburg to Shanghai SIPG for \u00a345.7m was a blow to the league.", "tags": ["Transfer window", "La Liga", "Serie A", "Ligue 1", "Bundesliga", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-15T09:11:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/17/liverpool-waterfront-world-heritage-site-status-risk-mayor-rejects-unesco-plea", "sentences": ["People ... come here for so many reasons \u2013 our culture, yes, our buildings, and because we are open and developing.\u201d But officials have warned that Liverpool\u2019s waterfront, whose buildings \u2013 including the Three Graces \u2013 inspired the creation of the Bund in Shanghai, could lose its heritage site status if it fails to comply."], "title": "Liverpool waterfront heritage status at risk as mayor rejects UN plea", "article": "The world heritage site status of Liverpool\u2019s waterfront is in jeopardy after the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, rejected a plea by UN cultural chiefs to halt development in the city.

Anderson said he would be writing to the UN body informing it that the city would not be complying with its request. He said: \u201cPart of the problem that we face is if we go out and say to people: \u2018Please come and invest in our city,\u2019 but then say: \u2018You can\u2019t put in a planning application for two years\u2019 \u2013 then our growth is going to suffer. \u201cWhat I am saying in my letter is that we have a track record of protecting heritage and that speaks for itself.

The city earned the designation from Unesco in 2004 in honour of its historic importance to the growth of the British empire and to European emigration to the US. But the waterfront was placed on a list of endangered world heritage sites in 2012 because of proposals to redevelop the docklands. Heritage campaigners recently went to court in a fight to stop the demolition of 10 historic buildings near Liverpool Lime Street station in the buffer zone. But the local authority said the number of historic buildings at risk of being lost is at a 25-year low and Historic England said the city is an example of best practice nationally.

Photograph: Lucas Vallecillos/Getty Images/age fotostock RM    A council spokesman said: \u201cLiverpool remains open for business and all planning applications will continue to be determined in the usual way in line with national planning policies and guidance. \u201cWe can\u2019t place developments in large parts of the city centre on hold as it would send out completely the wrong message to investors, cost jobs and leave us open to expensive legal challenges by developers. \u201cWe are working with the government, who make representations on behalf of world heritage sites at the Unesco committee, to look at how best to resolve the situation.\u201d The council said the suggested moratorium would put three large development schemes at risk, including an \u00a380m residential skyscraper planned for Princes Dock, a \u00a360m project to build two student accommodation towers near the main train station and a new ferry terminal. The world heritage site covers six areas of the city and most of its landmarks, including the Pier Head and Albert Dock. On the Pier Head stand the Royal Liver building, the Cunard building and the Port of Liverpool building, collectively known as the Three Graces.

The Portuguese follows David Moyes in July 2013 and Louis van Gaal in July 2014. Mourinho is confident he can be the man to take the club into a new era of sustained success following the fallow years after Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement in 2013.   Related: Warm welcome for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as new era opens for Manchester United | Paul Wilson    Yet Van Gaal and Moyes, as they set off for Thailand and America respectively, also felt they could deliver glory. Below is a snapshot of where each manager was as his first tour began \u2026 1 Itinerary DM 10 July\u201330 July Moyes\u2019s sole summer trip was a three-continent, four-country, five-city slog that took in Thailand, Australia, Japan and China, and remains the longest in United\u2019s history. The schedule was inherited from Ferguson and Moyes could have done without it as he grappled with succeeding a manager par excellence at one of the world\u2019s largest clubs. As the former Everton man flew off with his new squad the issue of a disaffected Wayne Rooney loomed large and there was also an ageing defence to consider: two problems \u201cbequeathed\u201d him by his predecessor. And in Ed Woodward, Moyes also had a new executive vice-chairman who was a novice in the transfer market. LVG 18 July\u20134 August This was shorter in time but still took in California, Colorado, Washington DC, Michigan and Florida and had Van Gaal already complaining at his opening press conference in Pasadena before the curtain-raiser against LA Galaxy. The Dutchman\u2019s mood was further soured by in-tour logistics he believed hampered his preparations. A prime illustration was Van Gaal being half an hour late for that media briefing at the Rose Bowl due to the team being located in a Beverly Hills hotel and having to fight gridlocked traffic out of the city. JM 19\u201326 July By United\u2019s standards this is a lightning affair and Mourinho has Van Gaal to thank due to his predecessor\u2019s unhappiness with the previous tour. United travel between only two cities \u2013 Shanghai and Beijing \u2013 and have only two games, against Borussia Dortmund on Friday and Manchester City on Monday. Conversely Mourinho added Saturday\u2019s friendly at Wigan Athletic to the schedule because he felt Van Gaal\u2019s build-up was a little light. 2 Expectation DM  As the six-year contract Moyes signed with United suggests, his task in his first season was merely to show he could handle following Ferguson by ensuring the champions finished in a Champions League place. After 34 Premier League games Moyes was sacked, the Scot lasting a mere nine months. Welcomed as \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d he left, in what is a cruel business, as \u201cThe Failed One\u201d. LVG After the disastrous Moyes tenure Van Gaal\u2019s initial challenge was to take United back into the Champions League. He did so at the end of 2014-15, in fourth place, but then fell down by overseeing elimination at the group stage of the competition and a fifth-place Premier League finish last season in a campaign that from December onwards was a long and difficult-to-watch stumble towards his sacking. Not even winning the club a 12th FA Cup in May could save him. JM   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola: five key challenges each manager faces    When Mourinho began his second tenure at Chelsea in the summer of 2013 he was clear that winning the Premier League would be the aim for 12 months down the line (which he delivered). There has been no similar calming of expectation with United, so it seems fair to conclude the 53-year-old is targeting a 21st title for the club this season. If not, his side must be serious contenders in May or Mourinho has failed. 3 Transfers by time of tour DM Moyes can \u2013 and did \u2013 curse his luck that United\u2019s chief executive, David Gill, also stepped down when Ferguson left as this left the inexperienced Woodward to work for him in the transfer market. The new manager was culpable of blunders, though, especially over the summer-long attempt to buy Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini as a package from his former club, Everton. All of this meant Moyes had no major new signings with him as United landed in Bangkok, none as they returned to Manchester three weeks later and, at the close of the window on 31 August, only Fellaini had arrived. But as there was no World Cup, Copa Am\u00e9rica or European Championship that summer, Moyes\u2019s only absentees for the tour were due to injury. LVG As United flew into LAX Airport two years ago, Van Gaal had already acquired Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera so could have no complaints about Woodward, though this did not stop him moaning at the new arrivals for their play on tour. This was a World Cup summer but, as England were knocked out of Brazil 2014 in the group stage, Shaw plus Rooney and the rest of his international team-mates were present. The early recruitment of Herrera and Shaw kicked off a transfer window in which \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Radamel Falcao, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind were also added. JM Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eric Bailly and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were all signed by 6 July and Mourinho believes he has a good chance of buying Juventus\u2019s Paul Pogba. This has to put several springs in the manager\u2019s step as United fly out despite those players involved in Euro 2016 and the Copa Am\u00e9rica being absent. Ibrahimovic is one of those afforded further rest. 4 The Ferguson shadow factor DM Being Ferguson\u2019s first choice proved an arsenic-dripping chalice once Moyes\u2019s results went south. As he was the man who followed the man, the last thing the Glaswegian needed was to be backed by him. Furthermore United were reigning champions which made their plunge to the seventh place Moyes left the side in when sacked seem all the more dismal. LVG   Related: Louis van Gaal tactics left Manchester United players close to mutiny | Daniel Taylor    Ferguson\u2019s shadow receded after Moyes\u2019 failure and this allowed Van Gaal extra grace. Yet finishing fourth in the first season would never be enough to dissipate the Scot\u2019s aura. What the Dutchman required was a title triumph. Instead United regressed into fifth position and Ferguson was again a key powerbroker in the club\u2019s saga over appointing Mourinho. JM Until Mourinho \u2013 or anyone \u2013 claims that first league title since Ferguson\u2019s 13th in 2013, the knight\u2019s legacy will always hover over United. For the moment Ferguson may have been edged to the periphery by Woodward finally giving Mourinho the job, despite the Scot\u2019s indifference to this decision. But fail like Moyes and Van Gaal and Mourinho will be gone, too \u2013 while the Ferguson legend will be even stronger. 5 Auguries as the tour plane was boarded DM Moyes\u2019s unveiling was littered with declarations of faint-hearted \u201chope\u201d regarding what his team would do. This may have been an attempt to respect Ferguson and the institution he was taking over but the result was the new man sounded cowed. It became the story of his tenure. LVG Van Gaal was the diametric opposite in his opening display. He was not daunted by the size of the club and came across as the archetypal chest-out, alpha-male manager United were desperate for. Yet the giveaway here was the one-eyed stance regarding the club\u2019s commercial operation. His players liked him as a man but as a man-manager they found Van Gaal difficult to fathom and hard to play for. Dismal displays and results followed. JM Unlike Moyes and Van Gaal, Mourinho has squeezed a game in before United took off on Tuesday. Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win at Wigan was largely academic apart from a telling caveat: the instant rapport between the away fans and Mourinho. Unlike the permanently seated Van Gaal, Mourinho virtually lives in the technical area so this allowed him to respond to their chants. His opening press conference was laced with what felt like a good blend of charm and pugnaciousness: again in contrast to his two predecessors. But, as always, all that matters is results. If he wins, he is doing all the right things brilliantly.

Related: Wayne Rooney \u2018excited\u2019 after only one training session with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho    When United landed at Shanghai they experienced a two-hour wait despite being taken through a private entrance into customs.

[Our presence here] is more about growing the sport. \u201cMore can be done in terms of the infrastructure of the sport, the coaching, the commitment to youth development and working in partnership with the government and private companies; we can lend our experience there, independent of any equity investment.

The view at the club is that the Belgian has to convince Mourinho he has the right attitude to succeed. Luke Shaw, who came through his comeback from a broken leg at Wigan unscathed, is keen to impress the new manager. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the fans in China are crazy about United, so I\u2019ve been really looking forward to coming here and playing a couple of games. It\u2019s about minutes but we want to impress our fans with the way we\u2019re playing and we also want to impress the new manager, to show him what we can do and fight to get into the starting 11. \u201cEvery pre-season is important for me because I always want to be fit, but of course I\u2019ve been out for 10 months. Everyone needs to look after their body really well. When you first come back, there are little niggles and tight areas that you need to look out for.

Related: Wayne Rooney will be very important for me, says United\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho    When you became Chelsea manager for the second time in summer 2013 you talked about building a dynasty. Do you wish to do the same at United? JM \u201cI\u2019m not at Chelsea because the owner didn\u2019t want me. If he wanted me I would still be there. I have the contract I have at United and for that the owners are happy. To give me a new [extended] contract I will be happy to do that because that is what I want at this moment in my career but I think it depends on many things. And I will try to do my work to make the owners realise I am the right guy for this job. But in this moment I\u2019ve only played Wigan.\u201d Having been considered as Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s replacement when he retired in May 2013 do you feel it was your destiny to manage United? JM I never thought about it really. The only thing I thought is that every club I was at I was always playing against Man United \u2013 with Porto, Inter, Real Madrid, always, Champions League matches, big matches, then with Chelsea to decide the title, FA Cup finals, Community Shields. I\u2019ve played so many times against United and what I felt was \u2013 and you know this is not easy with me \u2013 so many matches and no problems. It\u2019s very difficult to play against a club so many times and I have no problems. Not a yellow card, not a red card, not a strange quote, not an offensive word. I won a lot of times but I also lost and there were not any negative comments. How about when you first played United as Porto coach in 2004 in the Champions League? Ferguson was unhappy at Roy Keane\u2019s sending off. JM That was him [Ferguson], not me! So I always had that good feeling and I think the fans feel the same. I remember playing at Old Trafford and the way to the dugout was always nice. It was never like in other stadiums. There was always a connection. Then can you end up being their manager one day or not? I always felt what has to happen happens and it happened so. United have not won the title since 2013. What would it mean to you to return the club to the top?   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Manchester United start: first impressions as club heads to China    JM It is more important for the club and the fans than me \u2013 that is the way I have to look at it. The club is much more important than me, the fans are much more important than me so it\u2019s not for me. I\u2019m not working for me, I\u2019m working for the club, for the fans. That\u2019s the way I look at things. Can it be nice for my career to win trophies in every club? That would be amazing, to be champion in very club would be amazing, but that\u2019s an individual selfish perspective that I don\u2019t want. I work for the club, the club brought me here because they trust me. I have the feeling \u2013 of course not everyone, I guess \u2013 that the majority of the supporters they trust me, they believe that I can help the club. I have the feeling that the players want me. I\u2019m not saying they didn\u2019t want Mr Van Gaal, I\u2019m saying that since I arrived I feel that they are very fine with me and my way of leading and my way of work. But I want just to see my things in this way of perspective and let\u2019s enjoy the season because a big season is waiting for us. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is 35 in October. Can he perform in the Premier League? JM Yes, because first of all I know him very well [from coaching him at Internazionale in 2009-10]. I always think there\u2019s our age in ID terms but then there\u2019s our real age because for me the real age is not the age on your ID. That\u2019s just a date when you were born. The real age, the real ID is your body, your brain, your attitude and this guy is young, his body is amazing. The way he grew up playing the sports he did before football, especially martial arts, he was prepared in terms of his muscles and the mental point of view in a different way to the traditional football player, his DNA, his motivation. Let\u2019s be honest, he\u2019s very rich. He\u2019s made money all his career, he\u2019s won a lot of things, you only come to the most difficult championship in the world if you feel you can do it. If you don\u2019t feel you can do it you go to America, China, stay in the French league one more season. So the guy wanted this one more challenge. When I told him that I had won in England, Spain and Italy and he hadn\u2019t, that he\u2019d done Spain, Italy and France, he thought: \u2018Ahh, I want to go. I want to win every one.\u2019 So his motivation is high. His body is amazing. On Sunday he is going to start a specific programme we have prepared before he joins our group on the Thursday so he has five days just for him. So I expect he is going to be very good for us. Can the rest of your squad feed off Ibrahimovic\u2019s attitude? JM Sometimes people say the team has no leaders, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but what we need is everybody with the same kind of mentality. I like communication and push them to communicate. I give a lot of instruction in training. It\u2019s difficult for me to do the same in matches so I need guys on the pitch to read the game, to understand what we want. Zlatan is going to be one of them and I feel already we have guys to do the same. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a problem at that level. We have lots of quality. When I see our group in the attacking areas: Zlatan, Rashford, Rooney, Mkhitaryan, Mata, all the wingers we have. I think we have lots of quality in attack to produce good football and score goals. What are your first impressions of the squad? JM As we know not every player is here working yet but I was impressed. I\u2019m not surprised because I think at this level players are professional, they want to work, but I was impressed with the way they were working. Even here in Shanghai we have had two training sessions where it\u2019s very easy not to work well, it\u2019s very easy to be affected by the weather, by the pitch which is dry and slow, it\u2019s very easy to say: \u2018I\u2019ve got jet lag, I didn\u2019t sleep very well\u2019. And Wednesday we\u2019d arrived, had lunch, had commercial duties but the training in the first session was fantastic. So the attitude is very good, the appetite is very good, they want to work, they want to improve and they need to work a lot really because the most difficult thing in football that I\u2019ve found during my career is when I go to a new club and I need to change the dynamic, the way of thinking, things that the players do automatically. Maybe some managers after me at clubs find the same thing if they\u2019re not happy with the dynamic of the team. This is quite hard for the players because they become quite automatic in their way of thinking so to change some dynamics is not easy. They must be very focused but the players are giving all of this. The last couple of days Rooney, Smalling and Rashford have brought a different plus in quality because they replaced some players who stayed back at home. On Sunday even before we arrive back in Manchester I will send two of my coaches to start working with the other players. Step by step we are going to do the puzzle but it\u2019s easy to feel that they want it and that\u2019s very important. You sold Mata from Chelsea to United for \u00a337.5m in January 2014. Does he have a future under you? JM I sold because he asked for that. Nobody in my previous club wanted to sell or push him. He wanted to leave and my philosophy is I don\u2019t want players that want to leave. I want players that want to come and want to stay. But I think since the first day everything is clear between us. There is space for him. He\u2019s a talented player and I don\u2019t promise places to anyone. I promise respect and I like him so if he wants to stay and I think he wants \u2013 until this moment I don\u2019t have one little sign that he wanted to leave \u2013 so he wants to stay and yes, there is space for him and yes, I think he can be useful to the club.\u201d   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola: five key challenges each manager faces    If you obtain your fourth and final player \u2013 if it\u2019s not Paul Pogba or another one \u2013 are you confident that by May United will be challenging for the title? JM \u201cI don\u2019t know but I want. I\u2019m not going to hide behind three bad seasons, three bad championships, behind two seasons not even with the fourth place finish. I\u2019m not going to hide behind that, I\u2019m not going to hide also in that fourth is the target and everything better than that is amazing for us.

The Manchester United manager said beforehand the priority was for his new team to start the process of gelling, with zero focus on the opposition. This opening International Champions Cup game was in part, therefore, an exercise in searching for clues regarding the Portuguese\u2019s thinking.   Related: Manchester United v Borussia Dortmund: International Champions Cup \u2013 live!    Was there anything, then, in Antonio Valencia being asked to captain the side? Or Juan Mata being positioned at No10 and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was in that role against Wigan Athletic, being on the left? Or Daley Blind, a centre-back for most of last term, playing in midfield? Maybe, maybe not: to guess would be akin to tea-leaf reading at this nascent stage of Mourinho\u2019s tenure. What is clear is the quality Mkhitaryan possesses. It was displayed on Saturday at Wigan and the way the 27-year-old pinged one early pass down his corridor showed again why Mourinho bought him. This bright start was halted when Thomas Tuchel\u2019s side went ahead. Sam Johnstone, the goalkeeper, might have done better with the speculative 30-yard free-kick hit by Pierre Emerick Aubameyang. Instead it was spilled, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 hit one follow-up attempt beaten out by the goalkeeper from close in but, when the ball finally fell to Gonzalo Castro, he finished. From here the contest meandered for a while on a Shanghai night becoming ever more sultry. Mourinho had pointed out that Dortmund were well advanced of United in their preparations, having played four matches already, and it showed. Tuchel\u2019s men were sharper and stronger and by the 35th minute were 2-0 ahead. As United\u2019s manager said: \u201cAt the moment the engines are completely different. Formula 1 against Formula 3. They are much sharper and you can see that easily, so it\u2019s difficult to judge my players.\u201d United were breached down their left and, when a cross came in, Aubameyang\u2019s overhead kick was mishit, Valencia handled and the referee, Wang Di, awarded the penalty. Aubameyang slotted easily past Johnstone, who went right and saw the ball go past him down the middle. Aubameyang was running United ragged whenever the ball came near him. He slipped beyond Phil Jones and chipped Johnstone but the keeper recovered and made the save. By the end of the half Mourinho had switched Mkhitaryan and Jesse Lingard but the Portuguese, standing in the technical box, was witnessing a mismatch. \u201cAfter 10 minutes we know that one team started training 10 days ago and played one match, and the other team started one month ago and played already four games,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to see the difference of intensity and sharpness. For us it was very difficult.\u201d For the second half Jones, Lingard, Johnstone and Memphis Depay went off and Sergio Romero became the new keeper, joined by Marcos Rojo, Ashley Young and Marcus Rashford. The latter\u2019s introduction received a cheer from the crowd and the young forward was instantly involved in a United move, turning the ball into Luke Shaw\u2019s path. The left-back was clear and had Young for support but he overran possession and the danger fizzled out. Rojo\u2019s first act before his new manager was hardly impressive, as he was fooled by Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 before the Dortmund No7 made it 3-0. United\u2019s shape had become fluid; Rashford and Mkhitaryan switching at times between the left forward and No9 berths. It was from a ball through the middle the Armenia captain pulled one back, tapping home a Mata pass after lurking near the penalty spot. By the close Adnan Januzaj and Andreas Pereira were on for Valencia and Blind. Januzaj sparkled here and there but, as Castro added his second and Dortmund\u2019s fourth towards the end, the Belgian\u2019s intermittent threat could be viewed as the United display in microcosm. Mourinho continues to target Paul Pogba or another midfielder to complete the four major signings he wants. \u201cWhen we sign one, that crucial [player] work will be done,\u201d the 53-year-old said. \u201cThen the market will be open until 31\u00a0August.

That is something I\u2019ve now got to work on and get myself in the right position to score goals. I have scored goals all through my career and I have no doubt in my goalscoring ability.

As United prepare to take on Manchester City in Beijing on Monday, Januzaj is fighting for a future at the club which once seemed so bright. The issue is not a lack talent but the approach of the 21-year-old. His breakthrough season, when he starred under David Moyes in the ill-fated 2013-14 campaign, offered no hint of the questionable attitude that has since stunted his progress. The view at the club among the coaching staff and in the dressing room is that Januzaj\u2019s drift to the fringes may end in him wasting his chance at Old Trafford. When United announced provisional shirt numbers on Thursday there was a sign of how far Januzaj has fallen.   Related: Paul Pogba not worth record fee to Manchester United, says Paul Scholes    When Giggs retired after a supremely successful 23-season career at United in 2014 his iconic No11 jersey was given to Januzaj. At the club it was billed as passing of the baton moment. The handover was supposed to herald Januzaj becoming a first-team fixture for the foreseeable future. Giggs, who had become Louis van Gaal\u2019s No2, gave a special interview to the club website in which he extolled Januzaj\u2019s virtues. Not any longer. After two seasons wearing the No11 Januzaj has quietly moved to No15, while Anthony Martial, who had to vacate No9 for the incoming Zlatan Ibrahimovic, is to wear Giggs\u2019s former number. Januzaj broke into the consciousness in October 2013 when Moyes handed him a first Premier League start at Sunderland. United won 2-1 and Januzaj scored both goals. By the time Moyes\u2019s team travelled to Chelsea the following January Januzaj was established in the XI and Mourinho, then in charge at Stamford Bridge, was saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player. He is not 18 \u2013 he is 25. He is so mature and comfortable. A very good and important player. \u201cI just think he is a very good player with the great conditions to have a great long-term career. I don\u2019t know the boy individually but it looks like he has the lot.\u201d That is some praise; the kind Januzaj would welcome hearing again from the man who is now his manager. The sense, though, is that he could fade completely from the picture at United. In Mourinho\u2019s first game in charge, last Saturday\u2019s 2-0 victory at Wigan Athletic, Januzaj was given the second half to impress. He failed to do so during a run-out in which the manager switched him between the right and left flanks. In Friday\u2019s tour opener, a 4-1 defeat to Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai, Januzaj played only the closing minutes. There were moments of sparkle as there often are in the cameos Januzaj has become used to, but the real test is his attitude on the training ground. It is there that Januzaj has disappointed with his application and his team-mates are concerned he may not fulfil his potential. During the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with Belgium it was a similar story: those in the camp believed he had more to give. Two years later he was not selected for Euro 2016. During Moyes\u2019 tenure \u2013 lasting only 34 Premier League matches \u2013 Januzaj was a rare shaft of light. His form earned him a five-year deal worth around \u00a360,000 a week in what was viewed as a coup by United. Now Mourinho decides whether to let him go, either permanently or on loan again, following last season\u2019s unsuccessful temporary spell at Dortmund. That ended prematurely after Januzaj decided he wanted to return to United due to a lack of game-time. One player who kept him out of the Dortmund side was Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Earlier this month Mourinho signed the Armenia captain from the German club, in another blow to Januzaj\u2019s prospects. The manager is also deciding whether Bastian Schweinsteiger should be another to head for the exit door.

Mourinho was supposed to speak from 6.30pm at the same location where Pep Guardiola held a briefing at 11.30pm in a stifling room packed with media. Asked why the manager did not do the same as his Manchester City counterpart, a United spokesperson said: \u201cThe room was too hot and full.\u201d This caused disgruntlement among some of the local media, bemusement among senior City figures, and also led to confusion regarding whether Mourinho would field questions at all. After around half an hour he walked outside and did an interview with MUTV, the club\u2019s in-house station, then spoke with a large media contingent near the side of the pitch and as his players waited. With Joel and Avram Glazer, two of United\u2019s owners, present for the training session that was to follow, Mourinho was nonplussed by the episode and the general disappointing nature of the eight-day tour, which ends after the City match. \u201cI know, but that\u2019s what we have,\u201d he said, before pointing to the perilous state of the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium\u2019s pitch and on which fungus has been discovered. \u201cWe cannot just run away and disappear and not play. So we have to play and try to be lucky. Normally when you say lucky it is because you want a good result. The result I want tomorrow is to go home without injuries, and that is the luck I want.\u201d While City have had their deputy head groundsman, Craig Knight, at the stadium for 10 days to ensure the surface is as safe as possible, there is a chance the game could be cancelled if there is heavy rain. Mourinho was clear what his overriding priority is if the sides meet. \u201cIt\u2019s [near] the end, the last day, the last match and then we can go home and train in good conditions, conditions where the players feel good and safe and bring their concentration and intensity to higher levels again,\u201d he said. \u201cJust hopefully [in training on Sunday] we do nothing and wish no problems in the match and everyone goes home without injuries.

What they should have said was: a Georgian-era factory. Or a Shanghai factory in the 1920s. Or a Bangladeshi sweatshop today. In the history of work, the practices owner Mike Ashley appears to have tolerated have been common: underpayment, fines, refusal of \u201cexcessive\u201d toilet breaks, childbirth on shift, harsh discipline and sexual harassment. They most typically prevail where a political system is stacked so heavily against the workforce that there can be no countervailing voice, and where an economic model in its infancy requires the urgent extraction of profit through coercion. You need under-resourced inspection agencies; unions forbidden to organise; and a ready supply of cheap labour. So it was in the England of George III, so it is in Britain in the second decade of the 21st century. What is striking, when you consider the modern reality of precarious work and coercive management, is how the concept of human rights stops at the factory gate. The workers of Georgian England had no democratic rights or access to law. But the 21st century is supposed to be an age of universal rights. Every one of the practices described at Sports Direct appears to not just have broken employment law, but also violated the human right of the citizen not to be bullied, shamed, endangered or sexually harassed. And Sports Direct is not alone. There is the fast food outlet where, should one of the workers fail to smile, a \u201csecret shopper\u201d can deduct the bonus of everyone on the shift. There are the construction sites, bedecked with \u201cconsiderate contractor\u201d signs, where blacklisting is a way of life, and the hotels cleaned by migrants who face relentless verbal violence, deductions and inadequate protections. Why do we tolerate, between worker and manager, practices that would not be tolerated between the citizen and the state? The clue is in the physical geometry of the very first factory, in Cromford, Derbyshire. Richard Arkwright, who built it, was a benign employer \u2013 but the historic site contained three devices crucial to how work would be governed under capitalism: a high wall, a clock and a cannon loaded with grapeshot. The wall was to prevent people seeing in. The clock was to remind workers that their body clocks would be over-ridden by machine rhythms. And the cannon was there to prevent the local population storming the premises and tearing it to pieces. Today\u2019s equivalents needn\u2019t be so crude. Instead of the cannon and the clock, you have the camera in the cab of the truck driver; the GPS transmitter on the arm of the warehouse worker, tracking their speed and movement as they shift parcels; the barcode a home-care worker has to scan as she enters and leaves a client\u2019s home in strictly timed 15-minute slots.     Cromford Mill in Derbyshire \u2013 England\u2019s first factory \u2013 where the owner installed a cannon to dissuade revolt. Photograph: Alamy    But secrecy endures at work. From the warehouse to the software house, the principle of confidentiality is enforced. As a TV journalist covering workplaces, you face a binary choice: the official story or the undercover one. There is no negotiated space in which workers can talk freely about their work. This arrangement is tacitly endorsed when politicians visit. They arrive in hi-vis, shepherded by layer upon layer of corporate goons, speak to a selected worker for the cameras and then address a rally in which \u2013 strangely but predictably \u2013 nobody ever raises an actual political disagreement. Rights to heckle, to disagree, to boo \u2013 which would be normal at a public meeting \u2013 are removed in this private and unequal space. It is hard to remember now that it was once different. Long after my grandfather died, my grandmother would wander into the offices of the coal mine where he had worked to ask a favour, complain, or just talk to his friends. At my father\u2019s factory, I don\u2019t recall there being any security on the doors: you could nip in and bring him a sandwich. What went on in those factories and mines was public knowledge anyway, because the workplace stood at the centre of a stable community, with a rich institutional life of its own. Precarity works in favour of today\u2019s employers, both inside and outside the workplace. Virtually instant sackability, the absence of unions and the erosion of legal rights mean you shut up and put up with it while at work. The breakup of solid communities, the mercuriality of urban life and the detachment of the business elite from everyday society all contribute to the reduction of moral pressure on employers from the communities their businesses serve. In a few cases, against all the odds, workers organise. Cleaners at 100 Wood Street, a City of London office block, last week won the London Living Wage of \u00a39.40 an hour via the tried-and-tested method of striking (in this case for 43 days). The Unite trade union was instrumental in bringing the action that exposed Mike Ashley at Sports Direct. But so much modern work is casual and temporary that unions alone cannot right the wrongs. We need new legal rights for workers. Those that exist have been undermined by reduced access to employment tribunals, and by the exemption of small firms and agency businesses. And compared to post-2000 human rights law, the entire corpus of employment law, existing separately and conditionally, looks archaic. A new charter of workplace rights should start from principle of universality: that our human rights extend to the workplace unconditionally, and that human rights law can and should be the first line of defence against bosses like Mike Ashley \u2013 rather than a final option, pursued after months or years of sub-legal grievance procedures. Unfortunately, the Brexit process will throw all workplace rights derived from EU membership into jeopardy. If, as promised, Theresa May maintains Britain\u2019s signature on the European Convention on Human Rights, then it\u2019s up to all of us \u2013 not just unions and lawyers \u2013 to force the concept of inalienable rights into the workplace.", "tags": ["Sports Direct International", "Retail industry", "Business", "Employment law", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-25T14:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/25/manchester-united-city-beijing-mourinho-guardiola", "sentences": ["Again, there were the stifling, humid conditions that affect south-east Asia and make it difficult for players to train: a factor also present on Friday when United lost 4-1 to Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai."], "title": "Manchester United and City pay price of chasing global riches with Beijing fiasco", "article": "Chase the dollar or chase bespoke preparation for the new season? This is the question fans of Manchester United and Manchester City may ask following Monday\u2019s derby in Beijing being called off less than six hours before kick-off, and the unsuitable conditions often found in far-off destinations. Given the pitch at the National Stadium was a patchwork of loose turf and was infected with fungus, the puzzle is why the match was not cancelled earlier. The outcome was damaging for United, City and Relevant Sports, which is headed by Charlie Stillitano, the man behind the International Champions Cup.   Related: Manchester United v Manchester City game called off in Beijing over pitch fear    Hu Mulin, a 17-year-old wearing a David Beckham shirt outside the Bird\u2019s Nest, as the ground is also known, said: \u201cI am a big Manchester United fan. I love Beckham, Rooney and Rashford. I am angry because I had a ticket and now they can\u2019t play the match. We drove here by car and it took six or seven hours with my father and my friend.\u201d The farce may also cause awkward debate involving Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and the commercial departments of United and City about where the clubs go next summer. The decision to cancel was taken at 2pm local time following a pitch inspection but Mourinho and Guardiola already had strong reservations. These were simple: three weeks before the Premier League season starts, they had to prepare players in stifling heat and play on a pitch that threatened to cause serious injury. On Sunday, Guardiola, despite having considerable input into City\u2019s tour, highlighted the conditions, saying: \u201cWe know the humidity is not ideal.\u201d Weather that \u201cwould have caused problems anywhere in the world\u201d, according to Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, was blamed for the match being called off. Yet City\u2019s deputy head groundsman was at the stadium for 10 days, helping with the pitch. United\u2019s groundsman was also consulted about the surface and given the venue is rarely used for football each club had concerns before the torrential rain.           Vincent Kompany disappointed at Manchester derby cancellation in China    It may be the first time United have not been able to play a game in China but they have had at least one close call. Three years ago in Hong Kong, United \u2013 and City \u2013 experienced similar difficulties when almost incessant rain prevented David Moyes\u2019s side from training at Hong Kong Stadium before facing Kitchee in a friendly. Again there was concern about player safety. A few days before, City\u2019s match with Tottenham Hotspur at the same venue had a delayed kick-off and was shortened to 40 minutes a half for the same reason. Again, there were the stifling, humid conditions that affect south-east Asia and make it difficult for players to train: a factor also present on Friday when United lost 4-1 to Borussia Dortmund in Shanghai. Mourinho had no say in the two-game eight-day trip because it was planned by his predecessor, Louis van Gaal. Next summer it is his decision alone where United go, the club say. Yet Woodward and the owners, the Glazers, will have considerable input and will stress commercial imperatives. At City, Guardiola will make the call in conjunction with the commercial department and other club stakeholders. A glaring truth is that United and City are engaged in the race for global reach and the finance this yields. It means Khaldoon al-Mubarak and Ferran Soriano, City\u2019s chairman and chief executive respectively, sign off a trip to China then find Guardiola feel moved to say \u201cno injuries\u201d as his first words of the pre-Beijing derby press conference. It means Woodward and the Glazers can sanction a trip to the same destination and watch a visibly upset Mourinho wish for the \u201cgood luck\u201d of no injuries. Van Gaal, on his first tour with United in 2014, complained bitterly at the five-state odyssey across America that took in California, Colorado, Washington DC, Michigan and Florida. His preference was for the cooler, dryer climes of Europe. United returned the following year to America, the \u201ccompromise\u201d being there were two bases \u2013 in Seattle and San Jose \u2013 plus a flying visit to Chicago for the final game. In a message to fans on Monday City\u2019s captain, Vincent Kompany, said: \u201cThere\u2019s things in life that you don\u2019t control.\u201d But where his club and United choose to tour is within their control. In summer 2014, in the second year of Mourinho\u2019s second spell at Chelsea, he took the club solely to Europe, playing games in England, Austria, Slovenia, the Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, and Hungary. Yet there is a suggestion United may return to America next summer and for some length , because Mourinho favours three-week tours for team-bonding reasons. His decision to add an extra friendly to this summer\u2019s schedule \u2013 the 2-0 victory at Wigan Athletic \u2013 appears wise following the loss of the Beijing game. When the season starts United will have had five warm-up matches but City only three. For Guardiola there is a chance his team could be undercooked when they play Sunderland at home on 13 August and the Champions League play-off first leg the following week. Yet if fans want change it may be not be dramatic. Woodward says: \u201cI am sure we will return to the Bird\u2019s Nest\u201d while City have sold a \u00a3265m stake in the City Football Group to a Chinese consortium. It seems Europe is the location during the season, when the Champions League and Europa League are being played. In the close season the prime spot is the rest of the world.

Previously, however, the enforcement of such regulations has been patchy.  Qiao noted that moves to enforce the rules on current affairs reporting came just weeks after the head of China\u2019s internet regulator, Lu Wei, was unexpectedly removed from his post.

You don\u2019t have time to rest. We\u2019re going to kill our players. We can give them two or three weeks but the schedule is the schedule. We start in two weeks. We try to organise.

OK, we will play two more friendlies before Sunderland and we\u2019ll see how the condition of the players is and we\u2019re going to decide.\u201d One player Guardiola wants to add, however, is John Stones. City and Everton remain in talks with the Goodison Park club holding out for \u00a350m. \u201cEveryone knows we are going to try,\u201d said the manager. \u201cWe will see what happens.\u201d Guardiola admits some of his squad may be struggling to grasp what he wants from them. \u201cI don\u2019t know, some players get it immediately and the other ones never,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them I can tell a lot and they understand the process immediately. And for some of them one session is enough. So that\u2019s when we speak we have to meet each other. It\u2019s for a good reason. I can handle and see how they react and how they play.\u201d There was no place for Samir Nasri, who was overweight when he returned for pre-season. Guardiola, who will not let overweight players train with the first team and has banned some foods, including pizza, said: \u201cSami arrived a little bit overweight but he\u2019s much better now. Still there is a little bit of weight. Last season he was injured and we want to avoid that. The players that are on the pitch they are fit, their weight is in the right place.\u201d This was Borussia Dortmund\u2019s sixth pre-season outing to City\u2019s second and many of Guardiola\u2019s star players did not start, so a penalty shootout win over a side who defeated Manchester United 4-1 last week in Shanghai is hardly shabby.   Related: Borussia Dortmund 1-1 Manchester City (5-6 on penalties) \u2013 as it happened    The half-empty view is that City lack rhythm, desperately need more game time and, certainly before the break, showed an inability to heed one of Guardiola\u2019s prime demands: not to hoof the ball goalwards. The requirement for more action is why an extra friendly will be staged next week \u2013 it may be against St Johnstone \u2013 to compensate for the derby with United in Beijing on Monday being cancelled. Guardiola sent his team out with a three-man defence featuring Nicolas Otamendi, with Aleksandar Kolarov to his left and Tosin Adarabioyo the right. The wing-backs were Gael Clichy and Jesus Navas, a midfield trio of Fernando \u2013 the least advanced \u2013 Fabian Delph and Ferdandinho, with Oleksandr Zinchenko, a kind of floating No10 behind Kelechi Iheanacho. City\u2019s opening was scrappy. Willy Caballero made a number of mistakes that were a mix of poor clearances that went straight to Dortmund, and insecure goalkeeping that allowed one Marcel Schmelzer cross to squeeze under him. Guardiola was not pleased. During a drinks break the manager headed straight for Oleksandr Zinchenko to tell him off. This may have been about the pass the Ukrainian failed to make to Jesus Navas when the Spaniard had a chance to shoot. With Eliaquim Mangala, Bacary Sagna and Kevin De Bruyne not here because of a post-Euro 2016 rest, Guardiola chose to leave David Silva, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Raheem Sterling, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Samir Nasri, Nolito, and Wilfried Bony from the XI. They were on the bench, while Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta were not, though it is understood neither player is injured. After a first half that featured none of Guardiola\u2019s trademark slick style the question was whom he might introduce. The answer was Ag\u00fcero, Silva, Bony, Tour\u00e9, Aleix Garc\u00eda, Jason Denayer, Pablo Maffeo and Angus Gunn for Caballero. This made eight changes, only Fernandinho, Adarabioyo and Kolarov remaining. As Toure played in the defeat at Bayern, of Guardiola\u2019s A-listers this was the first action for Silva and Ag\u00fcero.Bony with Ag\u00fcero to his left and Silva to his right comprised City\u2019s second-half attack in a 4-3-3. They carried a threat previously absent and the Ivorian latched on to one Silva pass and worried Roman Buerki, in goal, with the attempt. As with the United-Dortmund match the crowd was disappointing: the venue appearing to have filled only a third of its 60,000-capacity. What did not disappoint was City\u2019s willingness to try to ensure Gunn\u2019s goal was not breached, Maffeo making one impressive clearance. Then came Ag\u00fcero\u2019s 79th-minute opener, from a Silva pass. Towards the end the replacements Tour\u00e9 and Bony were themselves replaced, by Sterling and Nolito. With virtually the last kick Christian Pulisic equalised to take the game to a penalty shootout which City won 6-5. But what matters is the work between now and 13 August.

The prize? A share of the $100bn-plus in overseas deals done by Chinese firms in the first quarter of this year \u2013 more than they spent in all of 2015, itself a record. These follow President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201cone belt, one road\u201d policy, aiming to address a slowing economy, falling currency and saturated domestic market. China\u2019s cash-rich companies are looking increasingly outside London, with recent eye-catching deals ranging from a 60-year, billion-pound construction deal in Sheffield to the \u00a345m takeover of Wolverhampton Wanderers by China\u2019s answer to Warren Buffett, and a spate of Manchester property investments. At an investment summit hosted by Manchester\u2019s business leaders last Monday, ex-players Dwight Yorke, Sun Jihai and Mike Summerbee entertained a coterie of Chinese executives before the dealmaking got under way at a plush hotel near Beijing\u2019s Bird\u2019s Nest stadium. Barbara Woodward, Britain\u2019s ambassador to China, who was at the event, said: \u201cChinese investors are looking for very big projects. That billion into Sheffield is a very big project that can transform the city centre. There are lots of investors with a few million to spend, but in China there is a large-scale approach which is very suited to helping us regenerate, particularly the north of England.\u201d In her first interview since Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Woodward insisted the outcome had not shaken investor confidence in the UK. \u201cThis is a month on now and we\u2019ve been very clear with the Chinese that the core investing fundamentals \u2013 skilled workforce, low tax, rule of law \u2013 all apply still. The Chinese are all signalling to us that frankly, with the pound lower than it was, then we\u2019re a pretty attractive investment destination.\u201d The ambassador also insists that the so-called golden era of British-Chinese relations \u2013 led by former chancellor George Osborne \u2013 was \u201cnot in trouble\u201d despite the economic uncertainty, and experts predicting a cooling of the relationship under Theresa May. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should abandon the golden era at all \u2013 and the Chinese side too were very keen on that. No one is walking away from that,\u201d she said. It may be months before the deals negotiated last week in Beijing become public, but executives present insisted that Brexit had not put the brakes on inward investment. \u201cI\u2019ve been very reassured,\u201d said Sir Howard Bernstein, Manchester city council\u2019s chief executive, who led the delegation in Beijing and said there were three or four big investments under way.     CGI view of Gary Neville\u2019s Chinese-backed redevelopment scheme in Manchester city centre.    A Manchester-based executive at property broker James Lang LaSalle, which advises clients on flagship London properties including the Grosvenor House hotel, said he was \u201cvery hopeful\u201d that new Chinese-funded deals would be announced within the next three months. Gary Neville, the ex-England footballer turned property magnate, last week became the latest to unveil plans part-funded by China that will transform Manchester city centre. His \u00a3200m project \u2013 which includes \u00a315m from Chinese investors \u2013 will see the construction of two new skyscrapers, a five-star hotel and a split-level public plaza in place of an \u201cunderused and unwelcoming\u201d block that will be torn down. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, said Neville, had prompted him to fly out to Singapore to offer soothing words to his business partners. \u201cThere is a level of uncertainty \u2013 there\u2019s even more uncertainty overseas \u2026 I suppose in some ways we had a decision to make: do we go or do we stop? Our duty as Mancunians is to go.\u201d Neville\u2019s is just one Manchester project to benefit from Chinese funding following the state visit by Xi to London and Manchester last October. Flanked by David Cameron and Osborne, the Chinese president bestowed his blessing on the then-chancellor\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, visited Manchester City\u2019s football academy \u2013 taking a famous selfie with striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Cameron \u2013 and announced the first direct flight from Manchester to mainland China. Ken O\u2019Toole, chief executive of Manchester airport, said the new Hainan Airlines service had so far filled more than 90% of seats and could smooth the way for further big-money investment deals in the north. The airport is understood to be edging closer to another new direct flight to China, this time to Shanghai. \u201cPrior to the existence of a direct flight, this money would have gone to London and the south-east but there is now clear recognition of the strength of Manchester and the north as an investment proposition, particularly in China,\u201d\u00a0he said. Manchester\u2019s estate agents have for some time been reporting heavy interest for the smartest residential projects from Chinese buyers. In some developments, they are reported to account for up to 25% of buyers, as they seek better value than they can get in London. But where President Xi goes, money follows. Less than two months after his visit, media tycoon Li Ruigang paid \u00a3265m to acquire a 13% stake in Manchester City\u2019s parent company. The Beijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG), which is backing the Gary Neville-fronted project and whose chairman was at the event hosted by Manchester\u2019s business leaders last week, has also agreed to provide funding to kickstart a \u00a3650m development of apartments, office space and gardens at Middlewood Locks in Salford. The Locks was one of 20 northern projects that together formed a \u201cpitchbook\u201d of investment opportunities, which Osborne took to Chengdu last year as part of a bid to raise up to \u00a324bn to fund development in the northern powerhouse. A Treasury spokeswoman said discussions were ongoing with more than 15 different Chinese investors over projects highlighted in the pitchbook. BCEG is also an investor in Airport City, an \u00a3800m commercial district close to Manchester airport that includes a \u00a3130m \u201cChina cluster\u201d \u2013 called Wuhan Square and Shenzhen Gardens \u2013 designed to attract Chinese firms setting up in the UK. Last September, a group based in Xinjiang, Hualing Group, also agreed to invest \u00a360m in Middlewood Locks, the Thorpe Park business zone in Leeds and a digital campus in Sheffield in a deal with the developer Scarborough Group.

Photograph: VCG/Getty Images    But it is the 60-year, \u00a31bn Sheffield deal with Sichuan Guodong Construction Group, announced earlier this month after 18 months of negotiations, that marks China\u2019s biggest investment outside London to date. The first tranche of the funding will see \u00a3220m spent on a handful of projects in Sheffield\u2019s city centre, including the city\u2019s first five-star hotel, together with residential blocks and student accommodation that according to the city council should create \u201chundreds if not thousands\u201d of jobs in South Yorkshire. A board made up of council leaders and Sichuan Guodong executives will meet twice a year, to jointly decide which projects to approve. Leigh Bramall, Sheffield city council\u2019s deputy leader, said the prospect of connecting Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool within 30 minutes of each other \u2013 by much-needed upgrades to rail and road infrastructure \u2013 effectively made much of the north \u201cone city, on a Chinese scale\u201d. While 30 minutes to connect the four cities may appear a distant dream, the Labour peer Lord Adonis said journey times between Manchester and Leeds should be reduced to 40 minutes \u2013 from between one and two hours currently \u2013 by 2022. In the March budget, Osborne unveiled plans for a high-speed line from Manchester to Leeds \u2013 HS3 \u2013 and an 18-mile underground road tunnel beneath the Peak District, with initial funding amounting to \u00a3300m. While the announcements were broadly welcomed, there has been criticism that HS3 ignores major cities like Liverpool and Sheffield. Bramall said there remains an outdated view of the north among Britain\u2019s London-centric investment community: \u201cSome British investors have got a somewhat bucolic view of the north, or certainly have had historically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese look at us with a fresh pair of eyes. They see the potential for big cities that have got great universities, with a fantastic quality of life, and they want to be part of the growth of those cities and make returns that way.\u201d There is, however, uncertainty about Britain\u2019s relationship with China post-Brexit and post-Osborne \u2013 especially since the government\u2019s decision not to simply rubber-stamp the Hinkley Point nuclear power project, which has substantial Chinese backing. Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at Nottingham University, said May\u2019s government would probably seek to cool Osborne\u2019s \u201cat any price\u201d approach, which led to him being praised by Chinese state media for not emphasising human rights. \u201cI think Hammond and May will want to have the relationship on a more normal basis,\u201d Tsang said. And that could be bad news for the northern powerhouse plans: \u201cIf they do I would expect the Chinese government to be less helpful on the economic side. \u201cIt is the beginning of the end of the so-called golden relationship but I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s over \u2013 yet.\u201d", "tags": ["Manchester", "China", "Greater Manchester", "UK news", "Sheffield", "Leeds", "Manchester City", "Football", "Manchester United", "World news", "Xi Jinping", "George Osborne"], "publicationDate": "2016-07-30T15:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/01/10-best-alternative-city-tours-europe-warsaw-reykjavik-barcelona", "sentences": ["There\u2019s a chance to discuss what you\u2019ve learned \u2013 over a pint \u2013 at the end of the tour.\u2022 \u00a310pp, coiste.ie Culinary backstreets, Lisbon     Market time \u2026 a stallholder at Mercado da Ribeira    Culinary backstreets offer in depth, specialist foodie tours in cities from Athens to Shanghai."], "title": "10 of the best alternative city tours in Europe", "article": "PolaWalks, Warsaw Instagram has fuelled our lust for instant travel photos, but this tour draws on actual cameras, arming walkers with a vintage Polaroid camera and a pack of film as you snap away in the Polish capital.

Zhou\u2019s friend and colleague, known as Feng, goes so far as to say it would be a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to have a game on one of these consoles. It\u2019s not necessarily the potential sales numbers and the success that might come with such a move, it\u2019s what the principle itself represents. Being based in Shanghai has meant that Zhou\u2019s years-long hobby of making video games has fell under the jurisdiction of China\u2019s ministry of culture [MOC]. This government sector attempts to strictly uphold the constitution of the People\u2019s Republic of China, meaning that any entertainment (including video games) that violates or smears it or China\u2019s image in anyway is banned or at least censored in the country. This isn\u2019t really a problem for Zhou and his small hobbyist games, but it has had a huge effect on China\u2019s video game culture at large, and it\u2019s this that he\u2019s up against. In 2000, the MOC banned foreign video game consoles and accessories entirely, all in an effort to stop video games having a negative effect on China\u2019s youth. The ban lasted until January 2014 in Shanghai when a free-trade zone was opened up for foreign console manufacturers such as Sony and Microsoft to sell their consoles under certain restrictions. It wasn\u2019t until July 2015 that the ban on consoles was lifted around the rest of China \u2013 15 years after its introduction. \u201cThe lift on the ban of consoles did give us Chinese developers some hope, a hope [that] could change the current market,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cHowever due to the publishing rules and policies here, the games on consoles are no more than translated big titles, such as Final Fantasy X-2, which Chinese gamers likely already finished. Gamers usually buy overseas versions of a game to bypass the slow publishing or censorship issue.\u201d China\u2019s \u201cgrey market\u201d is well-known for supplying the country\u2019s population with luxury items from overseas. Soon after the ban on consoles in 2000, the grey market became the place to acquire foreign consoles and the games for them, often in their original language. But these illegal imports were expensive, and so China fostered its own native plug \u2018n\u2019 play console manufacturers. They sold knock-off versions of the Western and Japanese machines, such as the PlayStation 3 clone The Winner and the Nintendo Wii copy-cat Vii, which would play pirated and cloned versions of popular games like the Mario series.     Young men play online games at an internet cafe in Beijing in 2010. Due to economic and cultural reasons, home consoles are still a hard sell in China following the lifting of the ban in 2015. Photograph: Liu Jin/AFP/Getty Images    It\u2019s due to this rampant piracy culture and the banning and censoring of video games by the government that has kept many game publishers away from China (it was only three years ago that Battlefield 4 was banned in China). But even if they did try to make a move over there now, even after the console ban has been lifted, they likely wouldn\u2019t have any success. Chinese gamers don\u2019t tend to buy software; instead, they pay for a period of play, usually in a PC gaming caf\u00e9, or they play free games on their smartphones. Generally speaking, the population are used to and can afford in-app purchases and the hourly rates of caf\u00e9s, but not to buy consoles and games. Trying to launch a games console culture in China, to kick the habits of the biggest PC gaming market in the world, is almost futile. And so, to release a Chinese game on a Western or Japanese console, as Zhou hopes to do, would mean convincing a publisher (probably a foreign one) to take it to the world. But Zhou is driven by the hope he experienced last year when the ban on consoles was abolished. It seems to have been enough to convince him to move beyond being someone who makes video games as a hobby, and become a full-time game developer at long last. Zhou co-founded Pixpil studio last year with a friend called Hong who had worked as a professional game artist since his first ever job. Zhou acted as the coder while Hong was the artist; a complementary coupling. Soon after, they met Feng at an indie game meeting in China, who would join them as the third co-founder of the studio, bringing another 10 years experience as a designer and coder to the team. The game they have been working on is called Eastward. It isn\u2019t much like other video games made in China. For the most part, they are MMORPGs or MOBAs, made to make money, to attract huge audiences hungry for competition. It even differs greatly from the other Chinese indie games Pixpil come into contact with, many of which are short, aggressive titles such as Code:HARDCORE, MOW: 2-Player, and The Swords. The one exception they point out is Fish, a part tranquil, part perilous game about the life of a creature of the deep . In comparison, Eastward has humbler origins and a quieter story to tell, and a much larger ambition. \u201cBefore we started the current project, we decided to start from the best [idea] we had,\u201d Zhou explained. \u201cThe artist Hong made a pixel-art RPG game mockup a couple of years ago. The art was so great that we always had the intention to make it into a real game. That was an easy decision.\u201d As to the name, that was all Zhou\u2019s idea: \u201cThe codename \u2018Eastward\u2019 is from some naive idea of mine from a long time ago. The idea was about travelling along the railway, in some post-apocalyptic world, eastward. We thought the idea was very interesting and picked it as the start point.\u201d Those two grasps at a direction were enough to get the project going. Hong\u2019s artistic style is \u201call retro-pixel\u201d and 3D lighting, achieving a game that is striking from first glance, as proven by the thousands of shares of the game\u2019s gifs and images on Twitter and Tumblr. It\u2019s not just the technique but the aim of the artwork that also sets it apart from all the other images vying for attention on social media. \u201cIn the world of Eastward, human societies are isolated and shrinking, due to some severe environmental problem,\u201d say Pixpil. To communicate this, Hong has drawn inspiration from both real and fictional locales. \u201cFor example, the famous Kowloon Walled City, the ruined sites in Fallout games, and so on,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cWe also have some photography books on our bookshelf, such as Thomas Jorion\u2019s Silencio and Jordy Meow\u2019s Abandoned Japan.\u201d During development, Hong has also apparently insisted on creating places that show details of urban decay, especially rust, encouraging the team to create spaces that look and feel as if people could have actually lived there.     The characters of Eastward are taken from personal relationships. Photograph: Pixpil    Pixpil was a small outfit at first, just the three of them exchanging ideas in a cosy apartment, each contributing their own money to match their ambition. But that soon changed in February this year when they accepted an offer of investment from an outside party. Initially, they appealed to the Chinese government for funding, but that didn\u2019t go so well. According to Feng, the government treats video game companies like any other, but it has preferences that Pixpil didn\u2019t match. \u201cAs far as we know, it\u2019s possible to get government funding in underdeveloped cities, where [the] government wants more investment in pollution-free industry,\u201d Feng said. Fortunately, after that rejection, an outside party stepped up and Pixpil was able to get the money they needed to expand. The first port of call was hiring more staff. \u201cWe had decided to make the project and the team bigger,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cWe spread the word through our SNS (social networking service) and a domestic gaming media [outlet] run by a friend. People showed big interest in our project, and we received quite a lot of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\u201d As the applications came in, the three founders of Pixpil had to look for a new office, but everything was moving so fast that there wasn\u2019t much time to make it homely. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve [been] moved into [the] new office for more than two months, we don\u2019t have much time for decoration,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cSo there are minimal requirements for a game dev studio (desks, chairs, and computers!).\u201d The office is bigger than the apartment, it being part of a tower block occupied mostly by other design studios, but it\u2019s still very cosy\u2014each employee has a small desk space, occupied by a monitor, lamp, keyboard, mug, and as many gadgets and toys as can fit into the remaining space. Once everything was settled, the rest of the partners joined. Everyone who is employed at Pixpil is known as a \u201cpartner.\u201d It\u2019s a term that Zhou is adamant about upholding no matter the size of the studio, which is currently up to eight in total. \u201cWe were expecting new partners [to] actively give their own input to the project, that\u2019s why I kept saying \u2018looking for partners\u2019 rather than \u2018hiring\u2019,\u201d Zhou said. Chief among these new hires were animators, and the three founders of Pixpil were especially keen to bring on those who had experience in the traditional animation industry. \u201cIt\u2019s because the traditional animators are better at expression, which is a very important feature we are targeting for our game,\u201d Zhou said. \u201cMaking it emotional and character-driven is an important target,\u201d Zhou continued. \u201cWhen we decided to add narration to the game, we were thinking about building some Japanese animation-like experience, just like the great RPG games back in [the] 16-bit era.\u201d He name drops Mother 3 as an important inspiration for its storytelling and animation. \u201cThere are also some other inspirations, like Ghibli\u2019s works, Tekkonkinkreet the film, and a lot of great games from Super Famicom (Super Nintendo in the West) and Game Boy Advance.\u201d The key to living up to these inspirations is, apparently, all in the animation. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need the animator\u2019s skill on expression. It\u2019s also the reason we chose the current character proportion, it\u2019s balanced for us to reduce the workload while keeping the capability to show some detailed facial and body language.\u201d The characters of Eastward are taken from somewhere entirely different than the game\u2019s other inspirations. It\u2019s personal. \u201cThe main characters are not [a] real father and daughter, but their relationship is very close to that,\u201d says Zhou. He adds that \u201cof course\u201d this is affected by himself recently becoming a father, as well as Feng, and it turns out Hong is planning to start his own family soon too. \u201cThe most important thing about being a parent is responsibility,\u201d Zhou reasons. \u201cBeing a father gives me a better temper, and I\u2019m thinking in more practical ways now. Also, I have much less time for playing games!\u201d     Pixpil\u2019s studio    The hope is that these personal relationships the team have built with their sons and daughters are conducive to providing an \u201cemotional experience\u201d through the game\u2019s stand-in pair. And the success of that, it is reasoned, will come down to creating a sense of responsibility within the player. \u201cIt\u2019s not a safe world, so certainly you will face dangers in the \u2018dungeons\u2019,\u201d says Zhou. \u201cYou will have to protect the little one, just [how] a father would. There will be moments the little girl makes trouble, too, just like what a child would do.\u201d Given how different Eastward is to the majority of video games made and played in China, Pixpil doesn\u2019t know how it will do. But the early signs are promising. \u201cWith the lift [on the] ban of video game consoles in late 2015 and the emergence of well-crafted Western indie games, now [the] Chinese market is more and more open for games with diversity and traditional fun,\u201d says Feng. It\u2019s still hard to predict the sales of Eastward in Chinese market, but we\u2019re trying to explore it.\u201d Shanghai is one of the most Westernised cities in China. \u201cYou can find familiar brands like Starbucks, Ikea, and H&amp;M here, \u2018safe\u2019 Western food and more adventurous Asian ones as well,\u201d said Yu, one of Pixpil\u2019s newest animators. It\u2019s why it\u2019s a city full of expats and where merchants can bust a living selling souvenirs. All around Pixpil is a country that thrives on trading with the rest of the world, its wares and its people, yet the video games made in China still remain mostly within the country\u2019s borders. Pixpil might be a small studio of only eight people right now, but it\u2019s embracing the recent opportunity that has opened up. To reach out to the world, to show the world what a Chinese video game can look like, and to hopefully deliver it on consoles that are accessible to the rest of the world.

Do the plays work when reimagined as manga books? What can we learn from the style of underpants worn by actors playing Falstaff in previous Royal Shakespeare Company productions? These were just some of the questions debated in Stratford-upon-Avon on Monday, as more than 800 scholars and enthusiasts from 48 countries gathered for one of the biggest academic conventions on Shakespeare to be held in Britain for decades.  The World Shakespeare Congress meets only once every five years, and has not been held in the UK since 1981. In the year of the playwright\u2019s quadricentennial, however, there could be no more fitting place to kick off the congress than the town in which he was born, continuing later this week in London, the city where he made his name and fortune.  \u201cStratford is a place where people have been imagining Shakespeare in different ways for 400 years, it has the resonances of all these different performances that have happened here,\u201d said Prof Michael Dobson, director of the Shakespeare institute at the University of Birmingham, which is co-hosting the event with the RSC, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and King\u2019s College London. \u201cEveryone who has been interested in and committed to Shakespeare sooner or later wants to visit Stratford, so it has traces of the huge long comet tail of \u2018Shakespeare\u2019 as well as his actual, mundane life.\u201d   Related: As You Like It review \u2013 bawdy and arboreal fun in the great outdoors    There was plenty of evidence of the writer\u2019s enduring popularity on a grey Monday afternoon, with crocodiles of tracksuited Chinese teenagers battling for pavement space with guided German walking tours. But one could also hear snatches of conversations, on the lawn outside the riverside theatre and in the gift shop at the playwright\u2019s half-timbered birthplace, about the staging of Measure for Measure and favourite productions of King Lear.  In a packed day\u2019s schedule, delegates from countries as diverse as Mauritius, the UAE, Egypt and India could choose between sessions examining the \u201cproblem\u201d with the Comedy of Errors, the role of chance in the gravediggers\u2019 scene in Hamlet, and the possibility that other writers may have collaborated with Shakespeare in his sonnets.  Tony Voss, who before his retirement was professor of English at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, in Durban in South Africa, said the value of attending the congress was that \u201cit puts what you\u2019re doing in perspective and prevents you from becoming provincial and narrow in your own work\u201d.     Academics and buffs are expected to visit the Bard\u2019s birthplace in their thousands. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Though he lived in Oxford at one point in his career, during which he frequently attended Shakespeare productions in the town, Voss said that returning to Stratford \u201creminds me that Shakespeare was, in the end, only one man. He isn\u2019t really the huge story that has developed around him\u201d. Later in the week, Voss will participate in a seminar on the meaning of the Comedy of Errors to South African audiences, and many other delegates spoke of the particular resonances of Shakespeare\u2019s work in their own cultural contexts. Yang Lingui, a professor at Donghua University, in Shanghai, said Chinese audiences had a particularly acute understanding of the immense cultural changes that were happening in Europe in the playwright\u2019s lifetime. Until cultural restrictions were eased in the late 1970s, he said, \u201cChinese people\u2019s experience of life was quite like the middle ages. Then their eyes were opened to the outside world \u2013 like the Reformation in Shakespeare\u2019s time\u201d.

She said: \u201cAs an actor I like to do as much research as possible to make the character as whole and complete as I can\u201d, adding that she particularly loved playing Shakespearean characters.  Why? \u201cThe characters are just amazing. And it\u2019s very physical and expressive, which is the kind of performing that I love doing.

The \u201cbedrock and common language\u201d of the album, as he calls it, is synth-heavy textures full of thrumming bass drones and claustrophobic bleeps that he developed in \u201cdark tonal jams\u201d at Utley\u2019s studio in Bristol. The pervading sound is warped and clattery, scarred and lush like a burned-out landscape. But those Bristol sessions were only the beginning. Flit is the work of many voices \u2013 you\u2019d be hard-put to find an album crafted through more layers of collaboration. For Green, sharing out the authorship seemed the only way to tell the fragmented experiences of people forced into exile. It started with his own family. \u201cI was recording my 88-year-old gran talking about her life,\u201d he explains while wolfing down a steak pie in the brief hiatus between photoshoot and afternoon rehearsal. \u201cThe idea was to save her stories for my kids, but I ended up finding out a whole lot during those conversations. And her stories seemed so operatic.\u201d Green\u2019s family were Jewish refugees who fled Austria in the 1930s. His great-grandfather left first, ending up in a Jewish ghetto in Shanghai, then a few years later his grandmother went to London with her mother.  \u201cAt the end of the war my grandad was still in Shanghai and had met somebody else, but eventually he made his way to London and fell back into my great granny\u2019s arms,\u201d he says.

Members of his wife Inge Thomson\u2019s family talking about the exodus from Shetland when there wasn\u2019t enough food on the islands. None of these stories are directly quoted on the album: instead Green sent them to a team songwriters \u2013 Ana\u00efs Mitchell, Karine Polwart, Aidan Moffat and Sandy Wright \u2013 who turned testimonials into verse and worked his musical bedrock into tunes. When the songs were ready, Green handed them over to singers Becky Unthank, Adam Holmes and John Smith to give them voice. All that\u2019s just the album, which is only one element of the live show. The other half is stop-motion/digital animation and 3D mapping \u2013 essentially videos projected on to various non-flat surfaces around the musicians \u2013 by White Robot.

Henderson describes finding a way to depict the moment when Green\u2019s grandmother left her grandparents in Austria because they were too old to travel (they would end up in a death camp). That memory is told, though not explicitly, in a song called Smallest Plant while on-screen figures are physically torn from their surroundings.

In many ways Flit is a natural step in his ongoing pursuit to expand the aesthetic parameters of the genre.

And the day that is not enough because we\u2019ve come to rely on all this visual bling, that\u2019s when we lose the ability to just listen.\u201d  So why did he feel the songs and stories of Flit weren\u2019t enough on their own? \u201cYou mean why am I adding to the problem?\u201d he shrugs. \u201cBecause I find it exciting. Because I\u2019ve always been about ears, and now I can be about eyes too. I\u2019ve spent more than 20 years thinking about pure music, abstract music, and now my creative world has exploded into multidimensional technicolour.\u201d He gets up and makes for the door. \u201cActually it\u2019s breathtaking.

Maybe, I thought, I was extending myself too far. Maybe I had reached my fabled turning point. A month or so after that, I started to have some numbness and an ache in my left arm and a feeling of clumsiness in that hand. Probably a pinched nerve, I thought, and did what most doctors do for medical problems, which is to take some ibuprofen. Soon after that, while I was giving a lecture to medical students one morning, the microphone slipped from my hand and fell to the ground. Medically speaking, dropping things is a big deal. I realised that something was happening, something troubling that I couldn\u2019t ignore any more. You never plan for a serious medical problem in your life, it intrudes, testing the boundaries of your constructed reality. Things had been going well enough for me. I was married with two young children and I liked the work I was doing. If I was stressed and sleepless and maybe a bit overwhelmed by new fatherhood, it was still a very happy time. I was working in an academic emergency department and teaching a course to medical students about the soft skills of being a doctor: how to talk to patients, how to understand their experience, how to make sick people feel better. It had occurred to me that to be a healthy person teaching students about illness might be a provocation of fate.   Related: The perils of being your own doctor \u2013 podcast    I ended up in a neurologist\u2019s office the next week sitting on an examination table in a hospital gown. Dr K came in and introduced herself. She had been recommended by a mutual colleague as someone who was clinically sound but also \u201cjust gets it\u201d. This much was immediately clear; she was warm and attentive and present. I felt self-conscious and exposed in the gown, powerless, vulnerable, all those things I teach medical students, but at least I was taking mental notes for my course. It is hard to be a patient, I had told them, yet this fact is famously hidden from the daily experience of the medical professional. When the tables are turned, you discover how unequal the relationship is, how completely dependent you are on another individual\u2019s goodwill. Check. But being a doctor-patient involves making a preliminary choice: should you reveal that you\u2019re a doctor? I typically do not, at least not at first. I want to get a measure of my physician when they\u2019re not on their best behaviour. I also know from practising medicine that anything that makes the doctor self-conscious or trips up their routine can affect their judgment and decision-making. The physician might, in their awkwardness or self-regard, take a shortcut or over-think the problem at hand. That said, sitting across from her I realised that I was worried. Suddenly I clung to whatever advantage I could: \u201cI\u2019m a doctor!\u201d I blurted. As I told her my symptoms, the numbness and weakness that I had, the clumsiness and dropped microphone, I watched her expression carefully. She nodded and said it could be a disc, just as I had suspected. \u201cBut as you know,\u201d she said, \u201cany space-occupying lesion in the spine or brain can also cause these symptoms.\u201d This was a way of saying \u201ctumour\u201d without using the word. I nodded, mentally picturing a tumour in my spine. \u201cAnd we also have to consider things like MS. Or ALS,\u201d she said, and then she looked away for a moment before glancing back to register my reaction, which was a welling sense of foreboding, of tumbling, of skidding down an embankment. \u201cOK, yes,\u201d I said pleasantly, \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about that one.\u201d Her office scheduled an MRI for me later in the week.   Related: How the ice bucket challenge led to an ALS research breakthrough    The abstraction \u2013 the intellectual understanding of disease \u2013 is a position of relative safety. The very real concern for one\u2019s own existential continuity is a different situation entirely; it is real, it is physical and, in my case, felt in the throat and chest. Our occupational disability as doctors is the awareness of the unlimited ways in which things can go wrong in the body and how lives can be ruined in a moment. We study disease in medical school and manage most of the time to keep the knowledge at a distance. But when it\u2019s our turn to be ill, our medical training can be a kind of inconvenient asset. Combined with a proclivity to connect the dots, the resulting suspicions can keep you up at night. It\u2019s common for medical students to experience spasms of hypochondria during their training. This hypochondria is a kind of paranoia, a tendency to see patterns when they don\u2019t exist. But I had never been a hypochondriac. And here was an experienced neurologist, a certifiable objective opinion telling me that there was something here. * * * The next few weeks were hard. I waited nervously for my MRI and more than once invoked my doctor\u2019s privilege: to skip the waiting list and get my results right away, to get a copy of the studies burned on a disk before I left the radiology suite, to text my neurologist on her personal cellphone for the final readings. I was working in the emergency department the evening after my MRI, seeing patients with the desperate complicity of a dying man tending to other dying men. Intermittently I would look up the dismal survival statistics of various spinal and intracranial tumours and then go back to my sad work. When Dr K\u2019s personal cell number flashed on my phone, I excused myself from patient care mid-sentence and walked out to the waiting room where I could get better reception. She had looked over the studies and spoken with the radiologist. Everything was normal. I did a fist pump as patients in the waiting room looked on. It was the elation of the near-death experience, of return to life! I came back to the ER with good cheer, full of hope for my patients as well, and that night I went to dinner with friends and slapped everyone on the back like I had won the lottery. When I saw my neurologist in her office the next week for the victory lap celebration she said, \u201cWell, I guess we should get that EMG now.\u201d Oh right. The MRI had only ruled out a tumour. I had forgotten about ALS. An EMG or electromyogram is a specialised test used to diagnose motor neurone diseases such as ALS. But why did she suggest it the way she did? Was the initial concern about tumours just a feint where ALS had been her real concern all along? What was she really thinking? The full force of my analytic mind was employed in the service of generating worry, but not for want of evidence.    I was working in the emergency department, seeing patients with the complicity of a dying man tending to other dying men    ALS \u2013 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known in the UK as motor neurone disease \u2013 has been thrown into the spotlight because of the highly successful ice bucket challenge, but for many years it was known in the US as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease in memory of the New York Yankee first baseman whose career was marked by record-breaking endurance. He played over 2,000 games in a row without a day off until the middle of the 1938 season when he began to tire and lose his coordination, no longer hitting with any power, sometimes falling down when circling the bases. He was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic at the age of 36 and he died less than two years later. Charles Mingus also died of ALS, as did Dmitri Shostakovich. A few years ago the historian Tony Judt died after a brave and stoic fight. I had wondered to myself at the time if I could be as brave as Judt. Probably not, I had concluded. But was it courage? Or some particular relationship to life, of being so enmeshed in it and caring so much about it that each remaining moment was a gift? Judt had his writing to finish. And I? Nothing quite so grand, but I had my family and two kids to raise. Suddenly I became aware my lack of any grand plan, my aimless floating through life. In time, ALS destroys the neurons controlling muscle movement, leading to complete loss of strength and the ability to control one\u2019s limbs and trunk and face, and finally the muscles of breathing. The cause is unknown, there no cure, there is no decent treatment and it is fatal within a few years \u2013 often much sooner. Perhaps most awful is that, in many cases, as victims are progressively disabled, unable to speak or swallow or move, their cognition is maintained. They must endure the burden of progressive disability and then the dying process as mute witnesses, without the grace of dementia that marks most other deaths. The affliction forces an existential confrontation for which nobody can be prepared. In any hierarchy of terrible diseases, ALS ranks near the very top. Dr K referred me to see Dr M, an ALS specialist at Beth Israel hospital who would do the needle EMG, which, as it turns out, is an uncomfortable test. But first Olga, the Russian technician, did a nerve conduction study. She put electrodes on my skin near major nerves to test the speed at which they conveyed impulses. My muscles twitched rhythmically without my consent and I glanced at the computer screen that was running something like a seismograph. I had no idea whether what it showed was good or bad. Olga chattered good-humouredly about her husband and grandchildren in Brighton Beach as I fidgeted in pain. When she was done, she left and told me to wait there for the doctor.   Related: American doctors are over-reliant on medical tests and patients pay the price | Kenneth Ludmerer    I didn\u2019t even bother to sit up. I lay on the table and stared at the ceiling until the smiling Dr M entered. An Irishman with a strong brogue and a warm and disarming manner, he put his hand on my shoulder and made a comment about my choice of underwear before cutting to the medical interview. Not exactly textbook, but I liked him. I explained my worries about ALS and told him why Dr K had sent me and he seemed unimpressed. \u201cYou\u2019re not that interesting,\u201d he said to me. His dismissiveness was reassuring, but then I imagined this was part of his routine to put me at ease. As my brain careened between extremes of fate, Dr M and I talked politics and he started to put small needles into my leg. He drew blood but did the examination without gloves, a gesture that in my shaky state I found vaguely consoling. I suppose that with my mortality nakedly exposed, this small intimacy felt like a comfort, an encounter without barriers. Later I would see him from the waiting room giving a long hug to a patient. He must have done this many times, breaking the news to someone about their fate. He finished the procedure and with a deep breath, absent-mindedly swabbed the small areas of bleeding on my skin and told me to meet him in his office. He stood abruptly and left. I found some plasters in the drawer and put them on the puncture points that were still oozing blood. I felt that everything in my life up to now had led to this point. I got dressed slowly.     Illustration by Stephan Schmitz    In his office, I scanned the diplomas and photos on the walls while he typed, looking at his kids and smiling wife and wondering how much of his work permeated his home life. He was frowning at something on his computer. Then he looked up said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you. The test was completely normal.\u201d I smiled inadvertently and felt warm inside. Waters rushed into a parched riverbed. Eagles soared over valleys. Are you sure, I asked? Yeah, he said, brusquely. Do you have any more questions? I didn\u2019t. I thanked him, this magnificent man, and stood up and walked out of his office and out of the building and on to the street of the wonderful living city. I called my wife to tell her the good news and on the way home I splurged on an expensive woven wool hat and smiled at all the New Yorkers in the subway. In the week that followed, I woke up early and happily performed all the mundane tasks of my life. I went cheerfully to work. But physically, I didn\u2019t feel back to normal. My symptoms hadn\u2019t improved, I just felt better about them. In time, I returned to the internet in an effort to understand what might be happening. I knew that people make mistakes in medicine, and wondered if he could have missed something. * * * You can find whatever opinion you want on the internet, and I did. A woman on a discussion board related the story of her husband, who was convinced something was wrong: he was feeling weaker and weaker, but his EMG was normal. Six months later he had another EMG and their suspicions were finally confirmed \u2013 he had ALS. Of course, the EMG, like any test, is operator-dependent and potentially fallible. The medical literature supports EMG sensitivities of only 60-70% for motor neurone disease. Dr M hadn\u2019t mentioned this possibility, that one EMG might not be enough. But then he was experienced with these things and he was only telling me what I needed to know. If I had a normal EMG but I might go on to develop ALS, then why tell me that now? What would be gained by subjecting me to six months or more of worry. Better that I enjoy my last few healthy months. And if I were smart, I wouldn\u2019t ask too many questions myself. A diagnosis is a curse. And so I decided I would live with the ambiguity in a kind of modified denial. I would not seek out more tests or opinions but rather wait for the disease to reveal itself \u2013 or hopefully not. At least this way, there was a chance I didn\u2019t have ALS. Throughout that dark winter, I lived aboard that tiny raft of hope. By the middle of February, I had started to get muscle twitches, another of the cardinal features of ALS. They started in my hand. A muscle would begin twitching for a few minutes and then stop. And then it might start somewhere else. Sometimes two muscles would be twitching at once. They would start without warning, tic tic tic, like someone tapping me on the shoulder to remind me I was going to die. Then would come a wave of fear, drawing back a curtain to reveal the mortal reality that I had successfully hidden from myself. I hid the fasciculations from my wife, but she figured something was wrong and I finally had to tell her. She thought I was being ridiculous, and I had to convince her to be worried. I showed her the twitches and then she did become worried. Then I had to convince her not to worry. I comforted her. I joked about it. But I felt lousy and weaker as the winter wore on. Meanwhile, my life was a gif loop of diapers and sleepless nights. My daughter, who was less than a year old, would wake up at three and start yelling. An astonishing man-like sound issued from her throat and grew in intensity until I got up and came to her crib and put my hand on her back for eight minutes. She would fall back asleep but then I would be wide awake, sitting in hallway in the dark, blinking in the glare of my phone as I read about ALS at three in the morning. Nothing had prepared me to confront my death. Despite having taught medical students about it and worked with dying patients, despite having read about it and done meditation and silent retreats, I quickly realised that I was lost. I was inadequate to the experience. I had not done any of the kind of spiritual work that would be required to forestall the panic and dread of facing my mortality. I didn\u2019t even know what that kind of work would look like. Leaving my children without a father was the worst of it. In my dreams they wandered through empty streets calling for me. I thought of Michael Keaton in My Life, making home movies to leave something behind for his newborn. I thought I should do this too, with my iPhone. But what to say to a four year old? Or to a 14-year-old? And how might I devise a system to deliver the content at set intervals?    I imagined an exercise where students would be told they have cancer and left to pick up the pieces of their lives    By the end of winter, I became accustomed to a novel feeling: living without hope. It was a physical sensation, a heaviness that presented itself shortly after waking in the morning and interwove itself into my daily activities. I went to work with my cloudy disposition but had no appetite for much else. The only thing that gave me some pleasure was buying electronic things on Amazon. The house was littered with motion operated LED lights, Bluetooth speakers, USB battery chargers, and other electronic detritus. In the medical school, I was tasked with writing the death and dying curriculum for first-year students. It was a cruel coincidence, as ALS is the exemplary case typically used in medical schools to teach issues around death and dying. My research on the topic required reading cases of patients grappling with weighty decisions as they died slowly of the disease, their spouses wringing their hands. I wasn\u2019t sure I could trust myself to calibrate the mood and hit the right note in the lecture; the trick was to include just enough grey realism for their level of development, tempered with some uplifting words to buoy them and give them purpose in their introduction to clinical mortality. It was work that had to be done but it gave me no pleasure. At the same time, I was testing first-year students on the physical examination. I sat in a cold room watching them examine each other, each one reassuring the other after every step as we had taught them: \u201cgreat, your lungs sound fine\u201d, \u201cyour heart is totally normal!\u201d Strung one after the other for hours, the performance seemed a celebration of their youthful immunity from harm and disease, their separation from the world of real patients and actual sickness. How absurd it all was, what a charade. And what a disservice to their real education. I imagined an exercise where students would be told they have cancer and left for a semester to pick up the pieces of their lives. It was only with my patients that I could escape from my predicament for a little bit. It felt good to care about them and try to put them at ease. My own proximity to death made me more present in their suffering. And whenever I came home to my two-year-old son running to hug me and tell me about whatever charming trifles had made an impression on him that day, I tried to be cheerful for his sake.     Illustration by Stephan Schmitz    One week, on two separate occasions at the hospital cafeteria, I bought a drink and something from the salad bar and the total came to $6.66. The cashier looked at me warily and my rational mind decided to take a break. I started doing everything in sevens as I had read that seven is a lucky number. Seven brushes of the teeth, seven chews of the burger. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether I had brought this illness on myself. Whether I had eaten too many microwavable burritos, or taken the wrong vitamins, if somewhere I had made a mistake, had become a person I was not supposed to be, whether I was paying some existential price for shirking my responsibility to some other life that I didn\u2019t pursue. I looked for meaning in my symptoms. I tried to read my disease as a sign. And all the while, I was bargaining with fate. One night after a few drinks, I donated $777.77 to the ALS foundation. I kicked myself for having forgotten to do the ice bucket challenge and promised to attend to that as soon as the weather got better. I promised I would have more fun, I would take a larger perspective, I wouldn\u2019t get enraged at how people drive in Brooklyn. I promised to live more bravely. To whom was I promising these things? At a friend\u2019s festive dinner, I was seated across from a woman from Shanghai. We talked about superstition and my fixation on the number seven\u2014it was part of my way of opening a door, if only she were to ask one more question then I could tell her about the ALS which I desperately wanted to do. Instead, she laughed and said seven is very unlucky number in Chinese mythology, a number associated with death. I felt like throwing up. I couldn\u2019t even manage a smile. * * * By the spring I had lost 5kg. My left arm and leg felt like jelly most of the time and fasciculations travelled over my body throughout the day. Sensory symptoms are not common in ALS, but can be found early in the disease. I still wasn\u2019t certain that I had the disease, but in my mind I was just waiting for it to get worse before I completely gave up hope. The inconceivable, irreducible, bewildering fact of my mortality was like some grotesque object that looked different from every angle, a concept that resisted incorporation into my understanding. It kept occurring to me how surreal it is that this is how it all turns out: this the resolution to the to the varied plot lines of my life. This is the punchline. I was not fun to be around. My wife was supportive and she was patient, but also gently pointed out the possibility that this whole thing could be all in my mind. Was there any objective evidence that I had the disease? Did I have any objective weakness? The answer was no and no. I carried my kids up the stairs, I could do 50 push-ups. Had the studies all been normal? Yes, they had. She convinced me to get out of my psychic echo chamber, to stop being my own doctor, as it were, and to go back to the neurologist. A week later, I sat in the examining room again, dressed in the insubstantial paper gown waiting for Dr K to walk in. I had decided to apply for life insurance and planned to ask as a favour that she minimise her concerns about ALS in the medical record. When she entered the room and asked how I was, I became overcome with emotion. I kept my composure with some effort and said that I didn\u2019t like the direction things were going and I was afraid I would have to make some serious choices soon. She looked at me quizzically and then when she got the point of what I was saying, she told me that I should see a psychiatrist. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m coping all right. I\u2019m certainly not going to take any antidepressant. I\u2019ve been\u2026 \u201d    I really don\u2019t think you have ALS, Dr K said. Two neurologists have told you this now, and still you're not convinced    She held up a hand to stop me. It was her opinion, she said, that my symptoms were not an organic illness. They were an expression of some inner psychic distress. It was all in my head, in other words. I blinked. This was welcome news, yes it was. In my own clinical practice, I often believe this of patients, and on rare occasions I\u2019ve suggested this sort of thing directly to them, but it\u2019s a tricky business. Many patients would take it as an insult. I, on the other hand, was delighted by the possibility. Certainly, the thought had occurred to me as well, but to hear her say it was better. But the solution felt too facile. Psychosomatic disorder should have been the diagnosis of exclusion, after having ruled out more serious things. I had never had psychosomatic symptoms before. In fact, while medical students are thought to be prone to hypochondria, practising doctors tend not to be. They are often notoriously dismissive of their symptoms, either because of fatalism or awareness of the limitations of medicine. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d I asked. She examined me and pointed out I had no muscle wasting. My reflexes were normal and my strength was fine. She couldn\u2019t elicit any fasciculations and she reminded me that all my studies had been normal. The lab tests and MRIs and EMG had shown nothing. I really don\u2019t think you have ALS, she said. Two neurologists have told you this now, and still you\u2019re not convinced. Maybe you need to change some things about your life. \u201cYeah I\u2019m sure I do,\u201d I said, \u201cbut could it be early ALS?\u201d She paused. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she managed. But it was clear that she couldn\u2019t give me a definitive no and I was going to be miserable until I knew for sure. We both agreed that it could be time that I see the ALS specialist. And this is how I was referred to Dr HM at Columbia. I was familiar with Dr HM because I had searched online for ALS specialists in New York. I had read his scientific articles on PubMed and looked at his photos on Google Images and had developed a deep admiration and gratitude for him based solely on projection. He was a distinguished-looking Japanese man whose image conveyed competence. I was eager to meet him for a third opinion because in one of his papers he had detailed a list of agents that may possibly slow the disease down. At the very least, I thought, he could tell me how to buy some more time.   Related: 'You think I'm mad?' \u2013 the truth about psychosomatic illness    What I was hoping for most of all was a diagnosis of benign fasciculation disorder, a poorly understood phenomenon of muscle twitching that appears to be more common in medical students and physicians. One author had coined the term Fasic \u2013 Fasciculation and Anxiety Syndrome in Clinicians. In his paper, he presented a case series of 20 consecutive doctors who presented with fasciculations over the course of a few years. Being doctors, and being familiar with ALS, they sought medical attention. A third of them were practicing neurologists. The majority of them left with a diagnosis of benign fasciculation syndrome. In other words, it was a thing: doctors who think they have ALS, but who actually have Fasic. But I kept getting stuck on doctor number 20 described in the paper, a neurologist who developed ALS and died. On a gusty and drizzly day, I sat in Dr HM\u2019s waiting room scanning the other patients for signs of motor neurone disease. A small neatly dressed Japanese man appeared in the doorway, looked at me and said my name. Dr HM emanated a benign and kindly paternal presence and immediately commanded my trust. I followed him into his large, not particularly modern, not particularly neat office and sat across from him. He took out a single sheet of paper and a pen and asked me to tell him my story. As I talked, he politely interjected questions and urged me to continue, all the while writing on that single white sheet of paper. When I was done, he looked up with raised eyebrows and said, \u201cIs that all?\u201d I felt embarrassed and had the urge to make something up. But if he was unimpressed, certainly this was a good sign. Then he led me to the table and did an exceedingly thorough examination. Everything about him was careful and measured and calming and I took note for my own practice \u2013 should I survive this ordeal. After the examination, I sat across from him as he slowly scribbled notes in his deliberate way. He looked up and took off his glasses and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been to two doctors now who told you that you don\u2019t have ALS. So it will be hard for me to convince you that you don\u2019t have it, but I will tell you that I have seen many patients with isolated fasciculations without any muscle weakness or objective signs and none of them have developed ALS.\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is over many years. None of them.\u201d I nodded. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he continued, \u201cI myself have had fasciculations for 20 years. I\u2019ve thought I had ALS many times, but I have never developed it either,\u201d he said grinning. This self-disclosure was an unexpected gift. I nodded, involuntarily and continuously and let the generosity of this great and learned man fill me up like oxygen. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have ALS?\u201d I asked. \u201cI really don\u2019t think so,\u201d he managed. I stopped nodding. And as if reading my mind, he suggested that if I had any further doubts, that I should get one more EMG, and that if that were normal, then I should forget about ALS. * * * I did get that second EMG from Dr M and it was normal. He confirmed a diagnosis of benign fasciculation disorder, mostly because we couldn\u2019t think of whatever else this could be. I told Dr M that I had developed a profound respect and admiration for the people who were working to find a cure for ALS. I had thought so many times of the families who loyally took care of their loved ones and the patients who bravely faced the unfaceable. I had donated money to the organisation, I had liked it on my Facebook page, I had considered going to some of their events. He shook his head and said that I should just forget about ALS. \u201cErase it from your memory and from your life,\u201d he said. His view was that the more I dwelled on this diagnosis, the more claim it had over me and the more I would keep manifesting symptoms. My symptoms are essentially gone now, though occasionally I feel something in my leg that will remind me of that dark time. In my memory, I was circled by a shark that ultimately lost interest and swam away. In the spring I decided to change jobs after 15 years at the same place. I took a long break. I started to lift weights. Some turning point occurred that I still don\u2019t have the perspective to understand. I was initiated, as people my age often are, into an awareness of the fragility of our being. I realise too that my adventure was a rehearsal for something else, the reality behind the curtain of youth that older people politely keep to themselves. Yet I have no interest in dwelling in the shadow of death\u2019s certainty. As the psychiatrist Irvin Yalom has written, living in proximity to death is like looking directly at the sun. In the absence of strong faith, it takes a special kind of spiritual evolution to face it with equanimity. I don\u2019t have that so I continue to live as before, with the adolescent\u2019s illusion of eternal life. This is not to say that nothing has changed. I have seen that life is dear and it is on loan to us.

Formerly chief executive of Blackburn Rovers, Williams\u2019s administrative skills are well respected in English football but part of his latest brief will be to help West Brom forge strong commercial links with China. While the first-team squad have already been pencilled in for a pre-season Chinese tour next summer, some of West Brom\u2019s younger players and coaching staff could well find themselves loaned to clubs in Shanghai and beyond. Meanwhile the scouting network will be expected to identify youthful talent in China before importing it to The Hawthorns. \u201cI am excited and privileged to have the chance to become the new owner of this great club,\u201d Lai said. \u201cMy immediate priorities will be to maintain the club\u2019s stable structure, respecting its well-run nature and its heritage. I have no intention of changing the club\u2019s ethos. \u201cThere are already strong links between China and West Bromwich Albion, which began with a historic tour to China in May 1978 when the club accepted an invitation from the Chinese government and became the first English club to tour China in modern history.

Now it\u2019s become a business issue \u2013 and business is something the government understands.\u201d When it transgresses from a business issue, activists face tightening restrictions. Filmmaker Fan Popo sued the government in 2015 after his film Mama Rainbow was removed from online sites. \u201cIn recent years the gay community has developed a lot on an economic level, but on a human rights level there has not been much improvement,\u201d he says. Campaigners also face restriction under new NGO laws.

Since I moved away from home, I\u2019ve sorely missed my mom\u2019s homestyle Chinese cooking, and my desire to recreate these dishes for myself spurred the impulse to document these dishes.

The move has prompted a warning from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, who said in a pointed Financial Times comment piece that relations with Britain were at a \u201ccrucial historical juncture\u201d. Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay. Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment? Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is under significant financial stress.  That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May\u2019s biggest concerns. Why is the UK courting Chinese investment? Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The UK\u2019s current account deficit was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a record high of 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015.  When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus. Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs owed their existence to China.   Related: Government says links with China are vital after Hinkley Point warning    What does China own in the UK?   Comparison with France, Germany and Italy   While the UK is not one of China\u2019s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined. Chinese investors have sunk about $38bn (\u00a329bn) into everything from prime London real estate to banks and football clubs since 2005, according to figures from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.    Chinese stakes in British companies 15:45   Three Chinese sovereign wealth funds are huge investors in the UK.  Safe holds 1% of BP and China Investment Corporation has 9% of Thames Water and 1% of Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky. Shanghai-based Bright Foods owns 60% of Weetabix, while Pizza Express, Sunseeker yachts, House of Fraser and Wentworth golf club are all Chinese owned. Chinese investors are also keen on British football clubs, particularly in the Midlands. Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers were both bought by Chinese investors, while West Bromwich Albion is being sold to a Chinese investment group. Investors CMC own a 13% stake in Manchester City.   Chinese investments: wholly owned companies   What Sino-British deals have been signed recently? During the state visit of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, last October, the government announced \u00a340bn of UK-Chinese partnerships, including Hinkley. BP agreed a \u00a36.5bn contract to supply liquefied natural gas to China Huadian Corporation, while Rolls-Royce signed a \u00a31.6bn deal to supply Trent 700 engines to aviation company HNA Group. China Construction Bank agreed to provide up to \u00a36bn of funding to help regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research at Oxford University. Aston Martin sealed a \u00a350m deal with China Equity to develop its zero-emissions RapidE sports car, while London Taxi Company owner Geely will invest \u00a350m in research and a new fleet of black cabs capable of zero emissions. Chinese investment is also crucial for the Northern Powerhouse project, which was placed in doubt by the departure of Osborne, its architect. This has stoked fears that any cooling of relations with Beijing could damage efforts to narrow the economic gulf between the south-east and the north of England. What future infrastructure investment will need Chinese cash? Ambitious projects require billions of dollars of investment and Chinese infrastructure investors are among those with cash to spend. Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for contracts worth nearly \u00a312bn to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands. A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because 10% of Heathrow Holdings is owned by CIC. Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment? Fears about allowing China such close involvement with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point. The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from members of the intelligence community.  One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row. It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of independent cybersecurity experts, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell. Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment? Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China\u2019s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman\u2019s land is close to a nuclear testing site. Huawei was also barred from tendering to take part in Australia\u2019s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout. The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage. Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a threat to national security by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon. Why does China like the UK so much? Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made. But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system.  Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets appropriated by the state.

His \u201cMay 16 Notification\u201d exposed and denounced supposed traitors (\u201ccounter-revolutionary revisionists\u201d) at all levels of the Chinese Communist party (CCP). By the time Mao died, just over a decade later, his final, extended purge had torn Chinese government and society apart. Perhaps one and a half million people died unnatural deaths (including two of Mao\u2019s designated successors), millions more had been brutalised, the\u00a0economy and education had been stultified by political dogma, and some 20 million had been banished from the cities to a countryside that could not feed them. The Cultural Revolution\u2019s hyper-Maoism had devastated and disillusioned the population. Public memory of these events remains fractured in China today. Some former Red Guards \u2013 Mao\u2019s shock troops for propelling the early violence of the purge \u2013 have apologised for their actions, while others still defend their beliefs; far more have buried their pasts. Leading novelists \u2013 Mo Yan, Tie Ning, Yan Lianke, Yu Hua \u2013 stress the sufferings of victims: the ordinary people persecuted by ideologues, opportunists and mindless thugs. Born-again neo-Maoists \u2013 many of them too young to remember the Mao era in any meaningful way \u2013 celebrate the Cultural Revolution as a utopian experiment in mass democracy.   Related: The Tragedy of Liberation by Frank Dik\u00f6tter \u2013 review    But reticence, above all, is the keynote of Cultural Revolution commemoration in contemporary China. In the\u00a0late 1970s, after an internal party wrangle, Mao\u2019s successors (many of whom had suffered between 1966 and 1976) vetoed de-Maoification in the style of Khrushchev\u2019s \u201csecret speech\u201d against Stalin in 1956. To denounce Mao comprehensively or permit open conversation about the Cultural Revolution, they decided, would jeopardise CCP legitimacy. In 1981, therefore, the party issued a resolution on \u201ccertain questions left over from our party\u2019s history\u201d, which acclaimed Mao as a pioneering genius, condemned the Cultural Revolution as a\u00a0freak error of excess leftism and blamed its horrors on the \u201cGang of Four\u201d, Mao\u2019s wife and her three closest collaborators. On the anniversary this year, the spokesman for the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs flatly responded thus to a question about the\u00a0revolution: \u201cThe Chinese government already made the correct verdict on it long ago.\u201d Public discussion of it remains so minimal that many who did\u00a0not experience it directly are vague or incredulous about its details. The 50th anniversary has generated conferences, articles and books outside mainland China; within\u00a0China, academics are fearful even of mentioning it in class. Since its publication a decade ago, Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals\u2019s Mao\u2019s Last Revolution has provided the most authoritative, comprehensive single-volume account of the Cultural Revolution in English. Its coolly analytical narrative exposed the unedifying mix of high-flown ideology and sordid factional wrangles. Now comes Frank Dik\u00f6tter\u2019s The Cultural Revolution, the last in his trilogy of works on the Mao era. It importantly extends MacFarquhar and Schoenhals\u2019s impressive work in two ways. First, Dik\u00f6tter makes more intensive use of evidence drawn from China\u2019s local archives, where historians (both Chinese and non-Chinese) have\u00a0been able to uncover abundant research materials on the Mao era for\u00a0the past decade and a half. Second, he excavates the unintended socioeconomic consequences of the Cultural\u00a0Revolution, arguing that a purge launched to preserve the anti-capitalist \u201cpurity\u201d of Mao\u2019s revolution had the opposite effect.     Zhang Hong Bing, who denounced his mother during the Cultural Revolution and said she should be executed. Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian    In the early 70s, years before Mao\u2019s demise, exasperated inhabitants of rural China were dismantling collectivisation and rebuilding private enterprises, paving the way for the resurgence of the market in China after 1978. The book is subtitled \u201cA People\u2019s History\u201d but plenty of attention is given to leadership machinations, especially in the early chapters. Dik\u00f6tter describes both persecutors and persecuted at the top echelons of the CCP as repugnant: in turn vindictive, bullying, treacherous and cowardly. Like MacFarquhar and Schoenhals before him, Dik\u00f6tter illuminates how high-level victims of the Cultural Revolution (such as Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping) helped build the culture of political violence that brought them down after 1966. Occasionally, the characterisation threatens to elide psychological complexity. Dik\u00f6tter unwaveringly represents Mao as a scheming megalomaniac, \u201cdeliberately turning society upside down and stoking the violence of millions to retain his position at the centre\u201d. There is a good deal of truth in this portrait, but Mao was also an ideologue, who genuinely believed in his political mission as the architect of world revolution. Peng Zhen, the mayor of Beijing who became the first target of the Cultural Revolution, is described both as an anti-intellectual hatchet man and, a few pages later, the friend and protector of one of China\u2019s most respected writers. Elsewhere, though, the book fully acknowledges the contradictory intricacies of the revolution. The campaign as a whole was justified by\u00a0an appeal to mass government (\u201cTrust the masses \u2026 [Let] the masses \u2026 expose all the monsters and demons\u201d), yet was dominated by top-down manipulation. One of the many tragedies is that through it Mao pledged greater political transparency and responsiveness to China\u2019s dispossessed, without any idea of the mechanics or implications of providing it; grotesquely bloody civil war ensued. This failure notwithstanding, Dik\u00f6tter also points out instances where ordinary people tried to make good the\u00a0liberatory promises of revolution rhetoric, denouncing the\u00a0inequalities and inequities of life under communist rule. In the archives, Dik\u00f6tter encountered striking examples of individual rebellion: a man who swore to resist \u201cre-education\u201d however many years the party made him sit through it; a family who dreamed of liberation by foreign invasion.     Handicrafts that had been condemned as \u2018capitalist\u2019 were practised once again in rural communities in the 1970s. Photograph: Andrew Wong/Getty Images    Dik\u00f6tter is best on the growth of a private economy during China\u2019s reddest decade. By the early 70s, some rural communist cadres \u2013 perhaps exhausted by the caprices of central party directives \u2013 allowed local farmers to distance themselves from the tyrannies of central socialist planning. Free-wheelers carved off private plots from communes, sowed non-staple crops that were highly profitable in a growing black market, and returned to sidelines (animal rearing, handicrafts) that had been condemned as \u201ccapitalist\u201d since the mid-50s. In south China, goods supposedly controlled by government monopoly were openly sold privately; gangs of entrepreneurs roamed the coastline \u201cgoing all the way to Shanghai to trade in prohibited goods\u201d. While Mao remains enshrined at the heart of Tiananmen Square and of the legitimacy of China\u2019s ruling party, the CCP will not lift the lid on discussions of individual and collective responsibility for the Cultural Revolution. But\u00a0the CCP\u2019s reluctance to revisit this history is not just down to\u00a0sensitivity about Mao\u2019s legacy. The\u00a0party also dreads remembrance of the political spontaneity that characterised phases of the revolution: the way in which hundreds of millions of discontented ordinary people, given the opportunity, lashed out violently at the party and government. China in 1966 was, like China today, a maelstrom of economic, social and political grievances, fertile ground for an anarchic mobilisation that easily escalated into\u00a0civil war. Since 2012, Chinese media voices and ordinary citizens have muttered that contemporary China \u2013 as it confronts economic slowdown after three decades of rising inequality \u2013 may be approaching a cultural revolution 2.0. This is a dangerous and appalling prospect, especially given the lack of public understanding within the country about what actually happened between 1966 and 1976. For\u00a0this, and many other reasons, Dik\u00f6tter\u2019s well-researched and readable new book on the Cultural Revolution\u2019s causes and consequences is a\u00a0crucial reminder of the tragedies, miscalculations and human costs of Mao\u2019s last experiment.

The pre-season favourites for relegation proceeded to finish in 13th, having never been troubled by even the faintest concerns of demotion, but far from being viewed retrospectively as a triumph, hindsight has lent the summer of 2015 the funk of failure. In addition to the manager, half a dozen of those signings have left the club (three of them, to be fair, were season-long loans, though two of those lasted only until January), with more likely to follow. Whereas Miguel Britos and Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl, central defenders signed on free transfers, proved excellent acquisitions, the midfielders \u00c9tienne Capoue and Valon Behrami impressed inconsistently, and Allan Nyom careered gamely if not entirely convincingly up and down the right flank, the remainder either failed or were never given a chance to succeed. The intention had been to replace the great majority of the promotion-winning team but instead Watford relied on their existing players completely. Of the team\u2019s 40 league goals, last summer\u2019s signings contributed three.   Watford graphic   What followed was a season of two halves. After 19 games Watford were eighth and only two points from the top five. They then won four of their last 19 matches, the 17th-best record in the division, and from the start of March onwards they won twice in 11 attempts \u2013 beating West Brom 1-0 when Saido Berahino missed two penalties, and 10-man Aston Villa, the only team whose record in this period was worse than theirs, with two goals in the last two minutes. The argument for extensive change, overstated a year ago, seemed significantly more compelling this summer. And so the team have been transformed once more, with Walter Mazzarri now in charge. In June Gino Pozzo celebrated the fourth anniversary of his takeover, a period that has brought great success but also a bewildering amount of churn. With people passing through the club like so many cuddly toys on a hyperactive Generation Game conveyor belt, supporters have struggled to form significant bonds with any of them, perhaps explaining their apparent lack of interest when the departure of the affable Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores was announced with one game of last season to play. The one constant amid the chaos is Troy Deeney, the captain and heartbeat who has become, in part as a result of the Pozzos\u2019 constant transfermongering but in part down to his own bloody-minded refusal not to excel, a totemic figure. The club\u2019s equally stubborn refusal to entertain Leicester\u2019s attempts to buy him, with a bid of \u00a325m turned down in June and the player instead signing what has become for him an annual improved contract, is proof that his status is acknowledged. Deeney is not the most gifted player, not the fastest or the youngest, but for this club in these circumstances, he is above value. An even more generous bid from Shanghai SIPG for Odion Ighalo, last season\u2019s top scorer, was rejected because the player\u2019s stated preference for the Premier League over the Chinese Super League, no matter how lucrative offers from the latter may be, made the alternative pointless.   Watford graphic 2   The arrival of Mazzarri also prompts a significant tactical switch, with the team likely to start the season using the three-man defence that has served the managerial pit bull well in his career (a short but lucrative hiccup at Internazionale notwithstanding) and from which he derives considerable, almost paternal satisfaction. \u201cMy formation gives me a tactical advantage,\u201d he has said. \u201cIt was an idea that came from the need to counter the superiority of my team\u2019s opponents. And I must say the formation is a source of pride. Since I started using it other important coaches have picked up on it \u2013 Antonio Conte has won three league titles with my 3-5-2. With my 3-5-2 Van Gaal took Holland to the World Cup semi-finals.\u201d He also trains his teams in alternative formations and can use several in the space of a single game, switching to 4-3-3 early in the friendly against Lorient. Mazzarri\u2019s reluctance to promote young players into the first-team squad was criticised towards the end of his time at Napoli as well as at Inter, but is far from unusual among recent Watford managers. To enable the team to play in Mazzarri\u2019s preferred formation the club has been forced to add to their small collection of centre-halves (the Belgium international Christian Kabasele arriving from Genk) and of wing-backs, with Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Brice Dja Dj\u00e9dj\u00e9 signing from Napoli and Marseille respectively. The complete absence of viable alternatives to Deeney and Ighalo that held the team back in attack at times last season has also been addressed, with Jerome Sinclair coming from Liverpool and the brilliantly named Isaac Success treading the recently well-trodden path from Granada. The 23-year-old midfielder Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9, renowned for an athleticism perhaps unsurprising in the cousin of the double World Championship gold-winning French hurdler Ladji Doucour\u00e9, signed in January but spent the second half of last season on loan with Success in Andaluc\u00eda before making his way to Hertfordshire.     New Watford manager Walter Mazzarri. Photograph: Tony Marshall/Getty Images    There remains a gap in the squad for a playmaker to operate behind the front two, perhaps the most important individual in Mazzarri\u2019s favoured formation, with a variety of recruits rumoured but none yet acquired. The two players previously on the club\u2019s books who might have auditioned for the role, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado and Almen Abdi, have been sold, to Espanyol and Sheffield Wednesday respectively.   Related: Fiery perfectionist Walter Mazzarri can raise Watford to greater heights | Simon Burnton    The shock of another remodelled squad, and the adoption of new tactics, could be eased by the fact three players \u2013 Britos, Behrami and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \u2013 worked with Mazzarri at Napoli (though it would be perhaps wise not to pin too much hope on Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, whose past three seasons have been blighted by injury and tragedy \u2013 his father died suddenly in January aged 50 \u2013 and involved nine, 10 and eight club appearances respectively). The squad spent the first part of pre-season encamped in a Hertfordshire hotel receiving intensive instruction, a move about which Sinclair said \u201csome of the lads are maybe not so keen\u201d but which may prove worthwhile in the long run, assuming Mazzarri gets one. It is the short run, though, that is of immediate concern. Friendly performances have been unconvincing, with a 2-0 defeat at QPR \u2013 a scoreline that barely reflected the Championship side\u2019s dominance \u2013 particularly troubling. Unhelpfully, the season starts with an exceptionally difficult run of fixtures, with the first five league games including visits to Southampton and West Ham as well as home matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. The second group of five games features encounters with all three promoted sides, and games against Bournemouth and Swansea. A considered judgment of Mazzarri\u2019s impact will thus become possible at the end of October. Watford approach the season with a new manager and a reshaped squad, largely uncertain as to what may follow. It is an unsettling but by now familiar feeling.

Murray, coming from 0-3 down in the third set, ultimately tamed the wild wind and the even wilder Italian to win 6-1, 2-6, 6-3, and is three wins away from a second Olympic gold medal. But the minor genius from San Remo delivered the Scot his first moments of genuine anxiety. \u201cI hadn\u2019t won a game for 40 to 45 minutes which doesn\u2019t happen too often,\u201d Murray said of his eight-game losing stretch until he turned it around in the third. \u201cThe conditions were making it very, very hard and once I got the momentum I went with it and that was it.\u201d Only Murray could make repairing a disaster sound like fixing a leaking tap. After a quarter of an hour Murray went 4-0 up without a hint of the resistance to come, not that one would know it from Fognini\u2019s demeanour; he is one of the game\u2019s most insouciant practitioners. If it were La Scala he would have been booed off the stage. As it happened, the crowd jeered sarcastically for each of Fognini\u2019s 13 winners in the first set (only six of them off his own racket) and a dip of concentration by Murray saved him from the dreaded bagel. Then came that tennis rarity: a sustained Fognini fightback, rich with flashing winners on either flank, fist pumps and passion. If he could be bothered to play like this all the time, what a force he would be. Murray had not lost more than three games in a set in his two impressive wins but a lazy forehand cost him his serve for the second time. When Fognini passed him with a superb crosscourt backhand to take the second set a sunbathing pit morphed into Circus Maximus. When he went 3-0 up in the third, delirium set in. \u201cLet\u2019s go Murray, let\u2019s go!\u201d rang around the arena. But a botched backhand handed Murray a break and the world No2 was back in business at 2-3. After more than two hours of intense, absorbing tennis Fognini, who had been so close to the upset, was serving to stay in the tournament. Murray, steeled to the task, grabbed three match points and Fognini handed him the win with one final undisciplined flail of his magic racket. Murray, who had barked at his box in the tight moments, looked mightily relieved. Earlier the American Steve Johnson, Murray\u2019s opponent in the quarters, needed only 64 minutes to take care of the Russian Evgeny Donskoy, for the loss of a game in each set. In their only meeting, at the Shanghai Masters last year, Murray beat Johnson 6-2, 6-4 on a court only marginally quicker than this one. But the 26-year-old Californian, 22 in the world and inside the top 50 for nearly two years, has had a decent season. He reached the fourth round at Wimbledon where Roger Federer beat him in three sets. However, like many outside the elite, he struggles for consistency. It would be a major shock if he were to beat Murray. It still looks as if the Scot will play Rafael Nadal in the final. The Spaniard, returning here after nearly 10 weeks out because of a worrying injury to his left wrist, had dropped only nine games against Federico Delbonis and Andreas Seppi, but had to work harder on Thursday to beat the stubborn Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-6, 6-3. The 2008 gold medallist \u2013 who did not play in London four years ago \u2013 has yet to lose a singles match at the Olympics. On a day bathed in sun and wind again after rain had wiped out Wednesday\u2019s programme, the first set took an hour and a quarter, the second 46 minutes. The elements have thus condemned Nadal playing two matches in one day \u2013 with the doubles to follow \u2013 but he did not appear to be saving much against Simon, one of the hardest workers on the circuit. That potent Nadal left wrist, which finally gave up on him after two matches of the French Open, looks strong again. Next up is Brazil\u2019s Thomaz Bellucci, the world No 54, who upset the Belgian David Goffin 7-6, 6-4 in a struggle that lasted just under two hours. Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, having put Novak Djokovic out in the first round, might yet block Nadal\u2019s path to the final, although the California-based Japanese Taro Daniel took a set off him before the Argentinian prevailed 6-7, 6-1, 6-2. In the quarter-finals he plays Spain\u2019s Roberto Bautista Agut, who found the experienced Belgian, Gilles M\u00fcller, hard to break down over the hour and a half it lasted.

How the hell did they pull that off?   But pull it off they have, and how. The professional darts circuit stages a hugely-supported, high-rating, broadcast-live-in-several-countries world series of darts. It\u2019s a made-for-television mega-operation with raucous tournaments in Dubai, Shanghai, Auckland, Glasgow, Perth and Tokyo.   We\u2019re here at \u201cThe Star\u201d in Sydney among upwards of 1500 merry Sydney-siders dressed as convicts and pirates and super heroes and Ghostbusters. Friday and Saturday they\u2019ll get 2000 \u2013 as good as sold out. The format pits a travelling top eight of darts champions against the host country\u2019s best local talent. And for one Tasmanian 21-year-old, it means tossing arrows against a legend.  Corey Chadby is the \u201cnew sensation\u201d of Aussie darts because he\u2019s 21 and very good. His old man was a darts player and his old man before him, and there\u2019s a huge mob of family up from Tasmania in \u201cTeam Cadby\u201d T-shirts. They call him \u201cThe King\u201d. His darts are 24 gram tungsten torpedoes. And if he continues on his current trajectory, he\u2019s Aussie darts\u2019 next big thing.  Yet it wasn\u2019t until five years ago that Chadby was allowed to play competitively. \u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t let me play until I was sixteen, until I could count and chalk,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been basically throwing darts since I was five years old.\u201d  Cadby competes on the Dartplayers Australia (DPA) tour, from which he wins an income capable of supporting his little family \u2013 partner, two-year-old, 7-month-old. Not bad for a 21-year-old travelling Australia throwing little spears.  Yet the real money is in Europe. It\u2019s in his plans. \u201cThat\u2019s the dream, mate,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s everyone\u2019s dream. So I\u2019m going finish off the Aussie circuit and have a word to the missus. In the DPA, you travel all over Australia. It\u2019s a good experience though you get sick of planes. \u201cBut mate I\u2019ve lived off it the last 12 months. It supports my family, that\u2019s the main thing.\u201d  So what\u2019s the plan? \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep playing like I am, and keep practising. And let the darts do the talking.\u201d     Phil \u2018The Power\u2019 Taylor hams it up before the Sydney Darts Masters. Photograph: Pacific Pres/REX/Shutterstock     Cadby trains every day, looking to get down from 501 in the least number of three-dart throws. He\u2019ll do that for an hour, then take a break. Then he\u2019ll practice for another hour. That\u2019s his day. Unlike the cliche of the heavy-drinking arrow man, Cadby keeps largely to himself. \u201cI\u2019m a family man,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t go out much.\u201d   And good luck to him \u2013 because he\u2019ll need it. For tonight, in his first time on television, he\u2019s about to take on the awesome Phil \u201cThe Power\u201d Taylor, the greatest darts player there\u2019s ever been. Even non-darts folk have heard of The Power; sixteen-time world champion; eleven World Grand Prix titles. He is the Bradman, Jordan and Gretsky of darts. And he looks like a lawn bowler from Woy Woy.  We head out among the crowd of Mormons and Trumps and Space Rangers and nuns and Tellytubbies to watch the first match: local boy Rhys Mathewson \u2013 aka \u201cMuffo\u201d: 21g Spectres, resident of Hoppers Crossing near former state research farm at Werribee \u2013 taking on James \u201cThe Machine\u201d Wade and his 20g Unicorns.   The pair trade 180s, and the caller man\u2019s larynx rasps long into the night: \u201cOne hundred and eiiiiiggghhtttyyyyyyy\u201d. It\u2019s like he\u2019s giving birth to something. Something very big. And up they go, the Wallies and Ghostbusters and that alien dog thing from that \u201880s show, ALF, all leaping about in the way of these things. And it\u2019s good to be at the darts.  Things go to script in the match with The Machine out to a 5-2 lead in the best of 11 sets. But he misses a match-winning dart and our man Muffo wins the next three legs to square it up 5-all. When Mathewson hits his fifth 180 of the match followed by double-20, it completes a sensational win for the local lad, knocking off one of the big boys 6-5. It\u2019s the first time this world tour season one of the challengers has knocked off a champ. The Australian media dude in the room punches the air repeatedly. Seems it\u2019s kind of a big deal.   Related: Away Days: boxer Joseph Parker's Rumble in Paradise thrills Samoa     \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Mathewson tells compere Paul Gow afterwards. \u201cI felt comfortable up there and I wasn\u2019t nervous, but usually when you miss your doubles against James you don\u2019t get another chance. I thought I was in trouble at 5-2, but fortunately he gave me a chance and I took it. It\u2019s amazing for me.\u201d  A few matches later, the one we\u2019ve come to see \u2013 The Power versus The King. Cadby comes out through a ruck of punters. He\u2019s hugging mates, waving, urging on the crowd. How about this for a young man? First time on television in front of a crowd a hundred times bigger than anything he\u2019s ever known. But he\u2019s into it, this big chunk of Tasmania with his Travis Bickle haircut and voluminous shirt. \u201cCome on!\u201d he urges the people. And come they do, bubbling about like so much fizzy drink.  And here cometh The Power, and the joint loses its mind. \u201cThere\u2019s only one, Phil Taylor,\u201d they sing to acclaim the great man, dancing about and drinking beers and revelling in the craic. Taylor takes the stage, waves, slightly stooped, shirt untucked, ambles up for his first three throws and boom \u2013 \u201cOne hundred and eightyyyyyyyyy,\u201d yells the raspy-throated announcer man, and the joint is a cauldron of sound.  When Cadby answers with his own \u201cOne hundred and eightyyyyyyyyy\u201d and punches the sky, his supporters are up as one. \u201cCome on Corey! Smash him!\u201d implores one mate. \u201cSmash hiiiiim!\u201d And so it goes, the pair of arrow-men trading 180s as Mormons dance with Power Rangers and groups of nuns scull beer and cheer. The air is thick with irony and incongruity. It\u2019s great.  Eventually, and though Cadby has his moments, The Power cleans him up, six legs to three. Cadby souvenirs the board and asks for a photo with Taylor. There\u2019s some chat with media before we corner him out the back. He\u2019s still sweating slightly. He looks his 21 years. But he\u2019s smiling still.   How was that? He shakes his head. \u201cMate, 21-year-old and I\u2019m playing against the greatest darts player there\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s unbelievable, mate. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d  That it is.

But I\u2019m still hungry and still want it, which is the most important thing.\u201d   Related: Rio 2016 quiz: identify the Olympians    Farah\u2019s biggest threats are likely to come from the Ethiopians Muktar Edris and Dejen Gebremeskel, who both looked comfortable as they breezed through their 5,000m heat in second and third. Edris, who has run the second and fourth fastest 5,000m times this year \u2013breaking 13 minutes on both occasions \u2013 presents the biggest danger having won Diamond League races in Shanghai and Eugene. Gebremeskel, who won the 5,000m silver medal behind Farah in London 2012, has gone sub-13 minutes this year, while his personal best of 12:46.81 ranks him as the fifth fastest of all time. A third Ethiopian, Hagos Gebrhiwet, who took silver behind Farah in Moscow in 2013, and bronze in Beijing last year, is also not without his chances. Yet Farah has such a hold on these men \u2013 just like everyone else he races against \u2013 that it would be a major surprise if he was beaten. Even at 33 his sprint finish acts as a spell that fires doubts into the minds of the bravest challengers. And when Farah steps on the line there is something else in his favour: the fact that no Kenyan has qualified for the 5,000m final \u2013 the first time that has happened since the Rome Games in 1960. The much-touted Kenyan Caleb Ndiku, who won silver behind Farah in the 2015 world championships, is out after finishing sixth in his slowly run heats, as is Isiah Kiplangat, who chased Farah in the 2013 world titles in Moscow before settling for bronze.

His biggest enemy could be his own body as he attempts to rebound from a hard 10,000m final last Saturday, when he recovered from a fall to take gold, and a 5,000m heat on Wednesday, when he was nearly tripped up again. Farah said: \u201cI\u2019ve got such a long stride so I find it hard not to get tripped up or tangled up with someone.

A career retrospective lets you be the judge", "article": "As a pop star, Madonna is the undisputed queen. Her recent albums Rebel Heart and MDNA may have sold poorly, but she\u2019s still the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time. As an actor, however, most critics agree that Madonna has got some way to go before she makes it into the royal family. Or even, some would say, the servants\u2019 quarters.  It\u2019s not for want of trying. Back in 1979, four years before the release of her self-titled debut album, Madonna starred in barebones indie drama A Certain Sacrifice. She played a Lower East Side resident living with three \u201clove slaves\u201d (one male, one female, one transgender). Capitalising on her first flush of fame, the film-makers rushed it out in 1985, but it\u2019s safe to say that it wasn\u2019t exactly acclaimed as a lost classic.   Related: Into the groove: how we taught Madonna to krump and thrust    Nonetheless, for years Madonna maintained an acting career alongside her musical one. Some of of her films performed decently at the box office and \u2013 shock horror \u2013 even got good reviews, like the 1985 comedy Desperately Seeking Susan. More frequently however, her efforts were widely ridiculed. Besides voicing a character in 2006\u2019s family cartoon Arthur and the Invisibles and appearing opposite Lady Gaga on a Saturday Night Live skit, Madonna has laid her acting career to rest after enduring a weapons-grade trashing for her turn as a snooty socialite in then husband Guy Ritchie\u2019s 2002 romance Swept Away. It\u2019s therefore little wonder that Swept Away isn\u2019t included in Body of Work: A Madonna Retrospective, a season of films at New York\u2019s Metrograph purporting to showcase Madonna\u2019s \u201ccalculated, cohesive canon\u201d. Together, the seven selections (Desperately Seeking Susan, Who\u2019s That Girl, Dick Tracy, Shadows and Fog, A League of Their Own, Body of Evidence and Dangerous Game) prove that while she never threatened to become the next Meryl Streep, Madonna\u2019s acting might not actually be that bad.     Desperately Seeking Susan: part of a \u2018cultivated, cohesive canon\u2019? Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock    Her first major vehicle, Susan Seidelman\u2019s Desperately Seeking Susan, makes the most of her megastar charisma. Released when she was in peak Like a Virgin mode, Madonna plays Susan, a free-spirited live wire whose identity gets usurped by a bored housewife (Rosanna Arquette). It capitalized on her edgy public persona; the role essentially required Madonna to be the same brassy pop starlet the world knew her as anyway. Susan\u2019s ragtag-chic wardrobe meant that she barely even had to get changed.  Yes, she plays herself (in the non hip-hop sense) \u2013 but maybe that\u2019s not as easy as she makes it look. Skating over 1986\u2019s Shanghai Surprise, a notorious bomb in which Madonna played \u2013 of all things \u2013 a missionary, the season next alights on 1987\u2019s Who\u2019s That Girl. OK, the 1987 comedy from director James Foley (he\u2019s helming the upcoming two sequels to Fifty Shades of Grey) is pretty awful, but Madonna emerges more or less intact. In her comfort zone as another street-smart girl, she\u2019s effortlessly engaging, even as the convoluted hijinks can\u2019t keep pace with her zany energy.     Dick Tracy: Madonna sizzles. Photograph: Allstar/Touchstone/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    Madonna slowly gravitated to more mannered performances, beginning with Dick Tracy in 1990. As sultry club singer Breathless Mahoney, Madonna relied upon all the glamour from her Express Yourself era to conjure a textbook femme fatale: erotic (\u201cI sweat a lot better in the dark,\u201d she coos to Dick Tracy) and mysterious. Director Warren Beatty was wise to afford her a handful of original musical numbers, written by Stephen Sondheim, that proved she could sell a show tune with the best of them. The following year, Shadows and Fog saw her collaborate with Woody Allen. While her role as a seductive tightrope walker in his sideshow murder-mystery only amounts to a cameo, Madonna holds her own opposite John Malkovich and a raging Mia Farrow, brashly delivering the line: \u201cNothing wakes Peter up, certainly not the sound of two people moaning.\u201d             Madonna returned to the tough city broad type in Penny Marshall\u2019s hit baseball comedy A League of Their Own (1992), bringing a ton of zest and a thick Westchesta accent to no-nonsense player Mae Mordabito. However, disaster was soon to strike. Uli Edel\u2019s Body of Evidence (1993), part of a three-pronged sex fest that also included her Erotica album and softcore photobook Sex, is unadulterated trash with none of the sly wit of its inspiration, Basic Instinct.  Madonna is as flat as a cycling holiday in the low countries as Rebecca Carlson, a sex-crazed gold-digger with murderous tendencies, but the the film\u2019s failure can\u2019t be entirely laid at her door. Brad Mirman\u2019s script is a true clunker. It\u2019s hard to imagine any actor who has ever lived convincingly delivering lines such as: \u201cHave you ever seen animals make love? It\u2019s intense, it\u2019s violent. But they never really hurt each other.\u201d            Both Madonna\u2019s performance and the film overall were lambasted by critics: Roger Ebert declared it as one of his most hated movies of all time. (\u201cIt has to be seen to be believed \u2013 something I do not advise,\u201d he wrote.) But give the girl some credit \u2013 few celebrities would throw themselves into the sex scenes with the kind of gusto Madonna exhibits. The infamous scene in which she drips candlewax on a naked Willem Defoe is sexy because it\u2019s done with such conviction. And hats and everything else off to the opening scene, in which she rides her supposed victim like a bull \u2013 stark naked. In fact, Madonna is at her best in Body of Evidence when she\u2019s relying upon her body language to do the job rather than the atrocious dialogue. She also gets slapped across the face by Julianne Moore in a bathroom \u2013 so there\u2019s that. She\u2019s equally as unhinged \u2013 though clothed \u2013 in Dangerous Game, which came out the same year as Body of Evidence, though with considerably less fanfare. Directed by Abel Ferrara, Dangerous Game is inscrutable and defiantly messy, starring Harvey Keitel as a director shooting a marital-crisis drama as his own marriage implodes in real-life.  Madonna stars as Sarah Jennings, a Hollywood star forced to plumb new depths as one half of the warring couple in his film. Ferrara\u2019s untamed approach suits Madonna, who is emotionally raw in ways she only hinted at in her climactic Dick Tracy scene, where Breathless Mahoney desperately pleads for Dick Tracy\u2019s affection. Right through Dangerous Game, Madonna\u2019s on edge, reacting viscerally to the abuse hurled her way. A scene where she\u2019s left crawling on the floor after being raped by her onscreen partner is deeply unsettling.             The grueling experience of confronting her demons in such a public forum purportedly proved too much for Madonna, who according to Ferrara \u201ckilled\u201d the film by badmouthing it. It\u2019s a shame, because the film proves that although Madonna is frequently heralded as the mother of reinvention, it\u2019s her ability to dig deep and connect emotionally with her audience which has made her records, if not her films, endure. Curiously, the Metrograph has opted not to showcase Evita (1996), in which Madonna proved her many detractors wrong with a full-blooded star turn as Eva Per\u00f3n. She even got a Golden Globe. However, there\u2019s no surprise that the series ignores The Next Best Thing (2000), her misjudged pair-up with then pal Rupert Everett. Madonna was indulging in her fantasies of being part of the English aristocracy, and her Downton Abbey-style tones are grounds alone for the movie to be consigned to the trash can (or dustbin, as she would no doubt then have said). Swept Away was, if anything, even worse, a critical and commercial disaster which torpedoed her reputation as an actor once and for all.  The scorn probably accounts for why in 2008 she tried her luck at entering another door in Hollywood by directing the London-set comedy Filth and Wisdom, followed by WE, her romance detailing the affair King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, in 2011. Unlike so many actors-turned-directors, Madonna opted never to star in her own features, probably fearful of how she\u2019d be received. She needn\u2019t be \u2013 Body of Work: A Madonna Retrospective shows that given the right material, Madonna could steal a scene for all the right reasons.

China is now the biggest renewables market in the world, more than double than in the US, and home to almost one of every three wind turbines globally.  Green buildings, however, make up a woefully small part of the green industry, with most work focused on quick construction and quicker sales. Estimates put the number of green buildings on the mainland at less than 1%, though a 2014 target by the State Council wants 30% of new construction projects to be green by 2020.     The Shanghai Tower (right) has been awarded the highest sustainability rating. Photograph: Connie Zhou/Gensler     In Shanghai, engineer Shunfu Cha points to 200 wind turbines spinning at the top of the tower \u2013 the world\u2019s tallest turbines, naturally \u2013 which generate around 10% of the building\u2019s electricity. \u201cThese are one of the most obvious green technologies,\u201d he says, gesturing upwards into the clouds. \u201cBut only one part of bringing down the energy use.\u201d  The building collects rainwater and re-uses waste water, has a combined cooling and heating power system and uses 40 other energy-saving measures that developers claim cut 34,000 metric tonnes from its annual carbon footprint. The building is wrapped in two layers of glass for natural cooling and ventilation, and in total developers say a third of the site is \u201cgreen space\u201d, including 24 sky gardens sitting between the two skins.  \u201cAt the moment, everyone is trying to achieve top green certification criteria,\u201d says Xiaomei Lee, managing director of Gensler Shanghai, the building\u2019s architect. \u201cBut nobody yet has achieved LEED Platinum for a supertall building. People assumed that a building of this size can\u2019t achieve such a high sustainability rating.\u201d  Shanghai Tower might be the only supertall tower to achieve LEED Platinum, but it is part of an increasing movement for towers to market green credentials as the demand for more sustainable urban development is felt.   The world\u2019s first Passivhaus-certified office tower \u2013 a certification rating that considers ongoing annual energy use, considered more stringent than other energy codes \u2013 was opened in Vienna two years ago, using 80% less heating and cooling energy than an equivalent tower through efficient power systems. London\u2019s tallest building, the Shard, also has a raft of sustainability features which enable it to use 30% less energy than a conventionally designed skyscraper of the same height. Globally, 75 skyscrapers are LEED rated.     Bosco verticale in Milan, with more than 1,000 different species of tree. Photograph: Alamy     More buildings are also turning green, literally. The Two World Trade Center development in New York has been designed to include a series of green terraces featuring different biozones. And in Milan, the Bosco Verticale is a pair of residential towers with 800 trees and thousands of plants on concrete balconies, maintained with recycled water. In Tel Aviv, plans for the Gran Mediterraneo tower include farms, vertical gardens and a range of fauna.  Advocates say that far from their reputation as polluters, skyscrapers offer environmental benefits. \u201cPer capita, skyscrapers use less energy and water, generate less waste and provide for a more engaged living experience,\u201d says Mahesh Ramanujam, chief operating officer at the US Green Building Council. \u201cWhen properly developed, they also preserve and protect precious green space in urban markets.\u201d    People assumed that a building of this size can\u2019t achieve such a high sustainability rating  Xiaomei Lee      But the concept of \u201cgreen skyscrapers\u201d itself is controversial. Buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, and critics point out that logically, taller towers will need more resources both to run and to construct. So are we just seeing the latest version of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d?  Environmental concerns include the fact that clusters of towers can make the streets below dark, trapping hot air and pollution at ground level. There is a knock-on impact in terms of carbon emissions, blocking light to surrounding properties, forcing the need for more electric lighting and eradicating the possibility of solar energy.  Tall towers also face charges of elitism. News that London has 260 new skyscrapers in the pipeline met with bitter opposition from campaigners earlier this year, largely on the grounds that these towers will mostly offer luxury apartments that do little to help problems of affordable housing.         In 2014, two Russian free climbers reached the top of the Shanghai Tower in just two hours.      And money is certainly to be made in green development. Investors and companies are increasingly looking to benefit from cost efficiencies, with maintenance bills around 20% less than typical commercial buildings. While they cost more to build, the USGBC estimates most green projects pay for themselves in around seven years, especially as property agents say rents in LEED-certified buildings can be up to 30% higher. The UN expects two-thirds of the world to live in cities by 2050 \u2013 the Chinese government\u2019s target is 60% by 2020 \u2013 presenting challenges over how to provide sustainable buildings in space-starved cities. Research has suggested that high-rise buildings are the most sustainable form of urban development. A 2013 report by Terrapin Bright Green, commissioned by the New York government, recommended knocking down Manhattan towers that were too inefficient and replacing them with even bigger skyscrapers. Modern replacements could be 44% larger and still use 5% less energy, the study claimed.  While Terrapin acknowledged that demolishing and rebuilding wouldn\u2019t be appropriate \u2013 or affordable \u2013 in every case, they found that even where buildings were knocked down and replaced, the energy needed to dismantle the existing building and construct a new one would still be offset within 15 and 28 years.  \u201cSome people have opposed taller buildings on the premise that they use more energy, but they have failed to consider the larger spillover effects of urban sustainability that come from a dense urban fabric,\u201d claims Sarene Marshall, executive director for the Center for Sustainability at the Urban Land Institute. \u201cWhile buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, transportation is a very close second. When you have a denser urban population, people are more likely to walk, bike or use public transportation to get to work. So if you build taller buildings, you have a denser urban fabric.     A 2013 report suggested knocking down \u2018inefficient\u2019 skyscrapers in Manhattan and replacing them with taller ones. Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images     \u201cIf you build lower buildings and spread them out over a longer distance, what often happens is a much higher footprint in automobile transportation.\u201d  A study by the New Climate Economy backs this up. Comparing the cities of Barcelona and Atlanta, with similar populations, Atlanta was found to have a much larger carbon footprint because people used cars to get around a large, sprawling urban area. The thinktank concluded that taller, denser buildings can dramatically reduce a city\u2019s carbon impact.   However, green credentials and promises don\u2019t always stack up. Critics say that LEED criteria focuses too much on the development of the building, and not enough on how it is used afterwards. A New Republic report claimed that The Bank of America tower in New York, hailed as the world\u2019s most \u201cenvironmentally responsible\u201d office building when it opened in 2010, actually produces more greenhouse gases and uses more energy per square foot than any comparably sized office building in Manhattan. In relying too much on LEED ratings, critics argue, developers and governments can get additional publicity without necessarily being energy efficient in the long run.   Related: Shanghai tower climb - in pictures     In many US states, there are also tax breaks for energy-efficient buildings, leading to claims that building designers target the easiest and cheapest green points in order to qualify as LEED rated and gain tax exemptions.  And there are cases where the new technology disappoints. In London, the Strata Tower in Elephant and Castle, met criticism by residents when it opened as its in-built wind turbines \u2013 designed for helping heat and cool the building properly \u2013 weren\u2019t turning. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in an eco experiment that has gone wrong at the design stage\u201d, one resident said. The promised new public garden at the Walkie Talkie tower in London also attracted criticism for being neither particularly green nor public enough.   For advocates of high-rise buildings, vertical development seems to be the future, and they remain convinced that green skyscrapers like the Shanghai Tower are the only sustainable way to do it. Sceptics will be watching closely for evidence that their optimism is not unfounded.

Come on over, the reef is fine The Courier Mail\u2019s take on the bleaching of the Great Barrier was front and centre on Monday in a story headlined \u201cWhite Trashed\u201d. The Murdoch-owned tabloid declared that the scientists were wrong and most of the reef is in fact in pristine condition: \u201cReef tourism operators have found less than five per cent of coral has died off \u2014 compared to the 50 to 60 per cent estimated by scientists \u2014 under \u2018extreme\u2019 mass coral bleaching on the northern Great Barrier Reef,\u201d the report in the Queensland daily said.     The Courier Mail front page on Monday. Photograph: News Corp Australia    The story quoted local businesses Mike Ball Dive and Spirit of Freedom who had commissioned teams of divers to survey \u201cthe hardest-hit part of the reef from Bathurst Head to Raine Island\u201d. Spirit of Freedom owner Chris Eade was motivated by global headlines which had \u201cdamaged the reputation of the $5bn reef tourism industry\u201d, he said.  \u201cScientists had written off that entire northern section as a complete white-out,\u201d Eade said. \u201cWe expected the worst but it is tremendous condition. Most of it is pristine, the rest is in full recovery. It shows the resilience of the reef.\u2019\u2019  Mike Ball Dive boss Craig Stephen also found almost no change in the reef: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we got underwater that we could get a true picture of what percentage of reef was bleached,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe discrepancy is phenomenal. It is so wrong. Everywhere we have been we have found healthy reefs. There has been a great disservice [done] to the Great Barrier Reef and tourism and it has not been good for our industry.\u201d In April, an aerial survey of the reef reported that up to 93% had been hit by coral bleaching. Professor Terry Hughes, from James Cook University and head of the National Coral Bleaching taskforce, said that the northern region of the reef was seeing mortality as high as 50% and he expected some reefs would exceed 90%. Hughes told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this scale of bleaching before. In the northern Great Barrier Reef, it\u2019s like 10 cyclones have come ashore all at once.\u201d    An exemplary case of #pubtestresearch https://t.co/hR1Wgwv6gK&mdash; Jeff Sparrow (@Jeff_Sparrow) August 23, 2016    Bad taste award  While we\u2019re on Murdoch tabloids, the bad taste award must surely go to The Daily Telegraph for its picture selection on the tragic story of British backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung who was stabbed to death in a Queensland hostel on Tuesday. With dozens more suitable snaps of the 21-year-old available online, the Tele\u2019s editor, Chris Dore, chose to publish on the front page on Thursday a photo of the murder victim scantily clad in long black stockings and underwear.  A bitter pill for ABC supporters There was an immediate outcry this week when the ABC announced it had entered into a commercial partnership with Swisse Wellness, a vitamins and supplements company which pays celebrities, including Nicole Kidman and Sonia Kruger, to spruik its wares. The ABC\u2019s international arm, a multi-platform, international media service called Australia Plus (A+), will now be branded with exclusive Swisse logos on its online platforms, digital and social media channels and Australia Plus TV. The ABC has also signed Monash University and the Victorian state government as partners. Swisse chief executive Radek Sali, who was one of the few people to be thrilled about the arrangement: \u201cOur mission at Swisse is to make people around the world healthier and happier, and through this exciting partnership we will be able to take our message to a number of new regions and audiences,\u201d he said. One of the critics was Dr Ken Harvey, an adjunct associate professor in the department of epidemiology and preventive medicine at Monash University. \u201cSwisse have an unenviable reputation for marketing their products, both in Australia and internationally,\u201d Dr Harvey told Guardian Australia.  \u201cTheir sales success reflect the large amount of money they spend on marketing hype and the use of celebrities, not on science. Their advertising claims have also been the subject of a number of satirical segments on the ABC Checkout program,\u201d Harvey said. In 2013 a story on the Checkout regarding some of the product claims was the subject of a defamation lawsuit which was eventually settled out of court with both sides paying their own costs.  But the ABC has defended the deal, saying ABC International is \u201cexpressly permitted under the ABC Act\u201d to accept advertising and sponsorship. \u201cIt does so in accordance with the ABC Editorial Policies, ensuring that editorial decisions are in no way influenced by any companies, government, universities or other organisations who advertise or provide sponsorship on Australia Plus. Because of that, the existence of sponsors and advertisers on Australia Plus has absolutely no improper impact or influence on ABC editorial content on the Australia Plus platform or anywhere else on the ABC.\u201d Worth paying for?

According to Bookscan figures, Worth Fighting For has sold just 2,665 copies to date. For comparison Niki Savva\u2019s book about former PM Tony Abbott, Road to Ruin, has sold 34,496 copies since it came out in March.

Clarke\u2019s desire to add experience to a fresh-faced team could lead to Donald being named despite a world ranking of 64. Should Donald be selected ahead of Russell Knox and Pieters, it will be deemed a bold and controversial call by Clarke. However, it appears the success of Pieters at the Made in Denmark event on Sunday could sway Clarke\u2019s thinking.   Related: Darren Clarke has to decide how many Ryder Cup rookies are too many | Ewan Murray    With Martin Kaymer and Lee Westwood certain of two of the three wildcards, much speculation has surrounded to whom Clarke would also turn. Prominent in the Northern Irishman\u2019s thinking is the level of Ryder Cup inexperience among those already in his team; five of the nine who automatically qualified will be rookies when taking to the course at Hazeltine on 30\u00a0September. Received wisdom points to the dangers of that, particularly for an away match. Donald, a former world No1, played in the Ryder Cup events of 2004, 2006, 2010 and 2012, with Europe winning on each occasion. The 38-year-old has been renowned as an excellent match player since his amateur days. The overlooking of Knox and Pieters would trigger raised eyebrows and an element of criticism. Donald has not claimed an individual event since 2012, while Pieters has won three times on the European Tour in the past year. It can also be argued that Westwood and Kaymer adequately offset one rookie pick. The Belgian\u2019s most recent success came in Farso when he triumphed by a stroke. His late, firm case for Ryder Cup inclusion was thereby confirmed. Clarke had partnered Pieters in the opening two rounds of that tournament, with the captain understandably impressed by the 24-year-old\u2019s power. Clarke\u2019s decision now surrounds whether or not to gamble on another debutant as Europe seek to continue recent domination of the Ryder Cup. On paper, Knox\u2019s case is arguably the strongest of the lot. The US-based Scot is ranked 20th in the world \u2013 the sixth highest position for a European \u2013 and seventh in the FedEx Cup standings. Knox won a WGC event in Shanghai last year before he had made himself eligible for Ryder Cup qualification by joining the European Tour and proved that success was no fluke when lifting the Travelers Championship trophy this month. However, Knox may not have endeared himself to Clarke during a recent interview where he stated the captain might have a moral obligation to select him. Knox also courted controversy by choosing a Challenge Tour player, Duncan Stewart, to appear alongside him for Scotland at this year\u2019s World Cup. Paul Lawrie, one of Clarke\u2019s vice-captains, was among those to question that move. Knox did not play this month in the Wyndham Championship, where Donald bounced back to form by finishing second. Davis Love III, the United States captain, will name three of his four captain\u2019s picks on 12\u00a0September. Love will then complete his team after the conclusion of the Tour Championship, five days before the Ryder Cup begins. Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, JB\u00a0Holmes and Bubba Watson are among those who did not qualify automatically for the US side. \u201cI know Darren well and he is not sleeping much right now,\u201d Love said on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s the most fun and nerve-racking time of being a captain.

The question now is whether the US, Britain and the EU will continue to ignore this once his successor takes charge, assuming a handover of power can be accomplished peacefully. Western priorities in Uzbekistan since the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse have focused on two main concerns: security and trade, particularly in gas, cotton and gold. Democracy comes a distant third. This approach, sensibly pragmatic or hypocritically cynical, depending on your point of view, also applies to the other autocratic central Asian states: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.  But Karimov\u2019s heedless brutality upset the strategic applecart in May 2005 when hundreds of anti-regime protesters were shot down by Uzbek army troops in the town of Andijan. The wider context was agitation against repressive governments across the region, notably in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s thwarted \u201ctulip revolution\u201d in March that year. George W Bush\u2019s administration and European leaders were forced to condemn the Andijan killings. In response, the ostensibly pro-American Karimov ordered the US military to leave the Karshi-Khanabad airbase that it had been using since 2001 to resupply Afghanistan.  Cementing his change of sides, Karimov signed a mutual defence treaty with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Karimov\u2019s refusal to allow independent investigation of the Andijan massacre \u2013 its victims remain unavenged to this day \u2013 and his pointed shift towards closer ties with China through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a Beijing front, marked a turning point in relations with the west.  Yet there was no real penalty to pay. Karimov got away with it and with the ensuing intensification of abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, rigged elections, religious persecution, media crackdowns and forced labour. That Craig Murray, Britain\u2019s ambassador who resigned in an unusual, personal protest over burgeoning abuses in 2004, was vindicated appeared to make no difference.   Fast forward a decade and John Kerry, sticking to the same old discredited script, had no problem cosying up to Karimov last November in Samarkand. The US secretary of state stressed Washington\u2019s support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uzbekistan, effectively lending legitimacy to Karimov\u2019s dictatorship after another presidential election swindle.  Kerry claimed to have raised in private the matter of human rights. But it was clear other issues dominated the meeting, not least US eagerness to halt the spread of Isis-style Islamist ideology and jihadism in Muslim central Asia \u2013 a spectre regularly invoked by Karimov to justify his actions. Kerry was also keen to enlist Uzbek support in curbing Russia\u2019s post-Ukraine expansionist tendencies, which at that point were taking flight in Syria.   Putting hardware where its conscience should be, the US had already resumed military cooperation, providing Uzbekistan in 2015 with 300 armoured utility vehicles and 20 armoured recovery vehicles \u2013 reportedly the largest single arms transfer by the US to any central Asian nation.  Part of the backdrop to the Samarkand meeting was Kerry\u2019s own State Department global report on human rights, citing torture, forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields and endemic corruption.  Human Rights Watch world report for 2015 was even blunter. Uzbekistan\u2019s human rights record was appalling, it said, with thousands imprisoned and torture endemic.  Whether Karimov\u2019s successor will prove more amenable to democratic governance is doubtful. What happens next may in any case be largely hidden from view. In 2014, the US-based thinktank Freedom House said: \u201cThe Karimov regime has all but eradicated free media in Uzbekistan. The few independent journalists who remain are subjected to harassment and detention.\u201d After last year\u2019s elections, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said meaningful \u201cpolitical debate and genuine competition\u201d were wholly absent.

He also stepped around one question about why he\u2019d approached Top Education, a company linked to the Chinese government, to pick up the travel overspend \u2013 why he knew they would be amenable to helping out. Dastyari said he knew the firm \u201cfrom the Chinese Sydney community\u201d but then deflected by saying: \u201cIt would have been inappropriate, regardless of who I had asked ... the issue was not the company, the inappropriate action was I should have made that payment myself.\u201d He rejected out of hand suggestions that he\u2019d been influenced by donations from Chinese business interests. \u201cNo one has ever asked for anything in return or nor would have I done anything in return,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked a private company to fix \u2013 to settle \u2013 a $1,670 office overspend that I should have paid for myself. \u201cI accept that and I take responsibility for that.

Shorten told reporters Dastyari \u2013 who he incorrectly characterised as a very junior figure despite his status as influential factional player, frontbencher and manager of opposition business in the Senate \u2013 deserved a second chance. As the political row escalated into Tuesday evening, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, was asked on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 how a donation from the mining magnate Gina Rinehart to his campaign differed from the funds supplied to Dastyari. Joyce told the program donations made via a political party were different. \u201cIt is auditable. There is an arm\u2019s length between the individual and that person, via the political party,\u201d he said. He said donations from Rinehart \u201cbalanced up\u201d contributions made to the Greens by the internet entrepreneur Graeme Wood, and by trade unions to the ALP. Joyce said he didn\u2019t have to give Rinehart anything in return for her support. \u201cTo be honest, Ms Rinehart, I haven\u2019t had to give anything. They are strongly of the conservative side of politics. There\u2019s no doubt about it. \u201cThey support the conservative side of politics. They\u2019re Australian. It goes via a political party. It\u2019s auditable,\u201d he said. Labor has used the current imbroglio to reignite calls for substantial reform to Australia\u2019s donations and disclosure regime, and Shorten wrote to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, offering support for a range of reforms, including real-time disclosure of donations, disclosure at lower thresholds a ban on foreign donations. Shorten noted on Tuesday there was now a \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d in the new parliament to ban foreign donations. The Greens have restated their commitment to boosting disclosure. On Monday the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said he supported an end to donations from foreign entities and corporations. Di Natale says the Greens would also support strict caps from not-for-profit organisations and individuals on the Australian electoral roll. Malcolm Turnbull signalled he was willing to countenance reform en route to the East Asia Summit, a gathering of leaders expected to ventilate tensions over Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. The prime minister has previously backed the principle of limiting donations to enrolled individuals, which would ban donations from corporations \u2013 Australian or foreign \u2013 as well as unions. A number of Coalition MPs have also endorsed an overhaul of the system in the prime minister\u2019s absence.

The attorney general, George Brandis, on Tuesday said the Dastyari imbroglio and the matter of donations reform were separate issues. Brandis told ABC\u2019s AM on Tuesday that a ban on foreign donations was \u201ca different conversation\u201d to the controversy around Dastyari, because it related to a gift, not a donation. He said political donations were subject to \u201cextensive regulation and an extensive integrity regime\u201d and gifts were not. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change the subject. This is about one particular individual \u2013 Sam Dastyari \u2013 who has accepted money from an entity ... that is effectively controlled by the Chinese state.\u201d The treasurer, Scott Morrison, told Sky News the issue was not about donation reform \u201cit was about Shanghai Sam, and he\u2019s got to go\u201d. He said Dastyari\u2019s conduct was \u201cbeyond explanation, beyond defence, and he should go\u201d. Di Natale said on Tuesday it was \u201ceasy\u201d to pile in on Dastyari, but it wouldn\u2019t change a system which was obviously in need of a significant overhaul. He said he would be courting Senate crossbenchers when parliament resumes next week to keep the pressure on for reform.

May is thought to be preparing to announce an expansion of selective schooling as early as next week, to please Tory grassroots members and set out a clear dividing line with Labour.

It referred to a \u201ccon doc\u201d, or consultation document, which education officials are thought to have been working on over the summer. The new education secretary, Justine Greening, who attended a comprehensive school, was revealed by the note to prefer the expansion of grammars to be one option among several proposed in the paper. Concerns were also raised about the problems of getting legislation on the issue through the House of Lords. When the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, published a white paper in the spring on proposals for improving education outcomes in underperforming areas \u2013 which led to a row about the expansion of academies \u2013 grammars were not on the list of proposals. Proposals could include forcing any new grammars to boost the number of children they take from deprived backgrounds \u2013 who are often underrepresented within the existing grammar system, a situation which persists in some parts of the UK, including Kent, which has a number of grammar schools.

Mears, who came to opera as a 22-year-old after seeing an electrifying performance of Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, has led the Belfast-based Northern Ireland opera company since it was founded in 2010.  Alex Beard, the ROH\u2019s chief executive, said it was \u201ca very exciting appointment.\u201d He said Mears had \u201csuccessfully established Northern Ireland Opera as an important part of the UK opera scene as its founding artistic director, conceiving and delivering a range of innovative and impressive projects on and beyond the stage.\u201d One of Mears\u2019s most important relationships will be with the Royal Opera\u2019s director of music Antonio Pappano.  Pappano said: \u201cI have been very impressed by Oliver Mears all through the selection process.

But after discovering opera when in his 20s he changed tack and became one of the founding artistic directors of the London-based company Second Movement, directing many site-specific productions. He brought some of that experience to Northern Ireland Opera where his successes included staging Britten\u2019s Noye\u2019s Fludde in Belfast Zoo, a production that travelled to Beijing and Shanghai. Other productions as director include Tosca, L\u2019elisir d\u2019amore, Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder and Salome, hailed by the Guardian as \u201ca startling achievement that confirms Northern Ireland Opera\u2019s growing status as a force to be reckoned with.\u201d Mears has also directed productions for the Young Vic, Opera North, Scottish Opera and Bergen National Opera.

Born in modern-day Turkey, he fled the approaching Muslim army and ended up as archbishop of Canterbury, where, among other things, he invented the parish system. If localism has a patron saint, he is a Turkish immigrant. For the parish system became not just the basic unit of ecclesiastical government, but also, for centuries, our basic unit of social togetherness. The whole idea of a priest and a parish was the very infrastructure of local community. With the shop and the pub, it came to define what we meant by the local. This was where roots were set, where generations were born and died, where the British values of social togetherness were nurtured. It was perhaps the single most important moral contribution of the church to British society. It\u2019s where the \u201cwe\u201d has precedence over the \u201cI\u201d. But localism is now much derided. On a plane back from Israel last week, passing the time with in-flight entertainment, I am subjected to the most excruciating advertisement for Pullman hotels. The music pulsates. A young man is going for a run in Shanghai, off to some high-powered meeting, then returning to his hotel. The narrator sounds sexy and enticing. \u201cNo frontiers, no borders, no limits. You are the beautiful nomads. And our world is your playground.\u201d I shuddered. What morally vacuous sentiments. I thought of all the people I might be literally flying over, risking everything, desperate to escape the misery of Syrian barrel bombs. No frontiers? No borders? Beautiful nomads? The contrast was offensive, sick. For millions, born with the wrong sort of passport, the world is a vale of tears, a daily struggle for survival and the survival of their children. These people squeeze themselves through razor wire and face the daily rejection of strangers. How they must loathe the easy entitlement of the beautiful nomad, ugly with self-worth, for whom \u201cour world is your playground\u201d. And, yes, I feel convicted by that description too. The philosophy of the beautiful nomad is often called liberalism. It\u2019s the philosophy of the unfettered self, free from restraint, free from the tiresome constraints of place and the local. Indeed, from the perspective of this liberal cosmopolitanism, the local community is a place to escape from, to grow out of, a place of narrow-minded sameness, a place to go back to at Christmas, but nothing more. Asked where he came from, the philosopher Diogenes replied that he was \u201ca citizen of the world\u201d. The beautiful nomad would think it an outrage that they\u2019d have to pay for a visa to travel to Europe, for instance. Michael Oakeshott, another philosopher, shows us how beautiful nomads are made. He argues that it is precisely the job of liberal education to sever people from their attachments to the local: \u201cEach of us is born in a corner of the earth,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut school and university are where a learner is emancipated from the limitations of his local circumstances. They are sheltered places where excellence may be heard because the din of local partialities is no more than a distant rumble.\u201d The values of the beautiful nomad are the opposite of those of Theodore and his community-orientated parishes. Here in the parish, what we mean by \u201csocial mobility\u201d is helping the elderly get to the shops. And not about clever youngsters moving onwards and upwards, cutting themselves off from their roots and their background, rarely to return. I know why the people of Syria leave their homes and seek a new place to live. Most of them would prefer to have stayed put. But they need safety. And we should welcome them. They are not hopping around. They want to settle. No, it is the beautiful nomad that is the dangerous creature. Having little respect for roots or for locality, s/he is the digital \u00fcbermensch, the epitome of capitalist entitlement that believes only in the things that s/he has made, bought or chosen. And like a locust, the rapacious consumption of the beautiful nomad turns the world into a desert. \u201cIt\u2019s not about where you are,\u201d advises the Pullman advert. Place is unimportant.

These stressors aren\u2019t simply inconvenient or irritating, though; research has suggested that urban living has a significant impact on mental health. One meta-analysis found that those living in cities were 21% more likely to experience an anxiety disorder \u2013 mood disorders were even higher, at 39%. People who grew up in a city are twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those who grew up in the countryside, with a 2005 study suggesting this link may even be causal.  Urban stressors appear to have a biological impact, too. A 2011 study from the Central Institute of Mental Health at the University of Heidelberg found that city living was associated with greater stress responses in both the amygdala and the cingulate cortex \u2013 areas linked to emotional regulation, depression and anxiety. This increased activation, the research team said, could have a \u201clasting effect\u201d, both on the brain\u2019s development and its ongoing susceptibility to mental illness. The studies are part of a wider field of environmental psychology that seeks to understand how individuals interact with their environments, and how those environments can affect our social lives, relationships and even our mental health.  The issue is hotly debated. For example, it\u2019s often believed that open plan offices promote pro-social working and avoid the drab monotony of cubicle working, but other studies claim that it can instead be bad for productivity and wellbeing.  Co-housing is often promoted as a way of encouraging community spirit. Many people who live in these communities \u2013 usually private bedrooms with communal kitchens or social areas and shared maintenance responsibility \u2013 have reported increased happiness and connection with other residents. But other studies have stressed that tenants can lose their sense of individualism and privacy.     Lilac Grove in Leeds, a co-housing project built on the site of a former school. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    Layla McCay, director of the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health, says these debates are complex and dependent on a number of nuanced factors. The think tank was set up to encourage more rigorous evaluation on the way we design our cities, and what impact it can have on mental wellbeing. She isolates several elements that she believes have a positive influence: access to nature or green spaces, the design of public spaces that facilitate physical activity and encourage social interaction, and living and working in spaces that feel safe.  But what about particular kinds of buildings? Brutalist structures like the Barbican estate in London are not always considered to be so positive for mental health, with many condemning brutalism\u2019s depressing aesthetic. Yet despite some calling it London\u2019s \u201cugliest building\u201d, the Barbican is a perfect example of the positive attributes outlined by McCay. Full of greenery, lakes and balconies, the estate also gives pedestrians priority over cars and features mini town squares where residents can socialise, work and relax. The estate is well lit and designed with good sight lines, meaning residents feel safe \u2013 a huge factor in their mental wellbeing. But this can be a difficult line to tread. Though well-lit areas are generally considered to reduce stress by increasing feelings of safety, it has been argued that darkness is a luxury not afforded to those living in council housing. If you live in an estate where bright lights shine in your window, you may lose sleep or feel exposed and surveilled; darkness, on the other hand, can be more subtly landscaped to provide a sense of value, safety and beauty.     It has been suggested that abandoned shops can make people more anxious. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    But if a so-called ugly building can still be positive for mental health, what role does beauty and aesthetic have to play? Despite beauty being a subjective term, recent research has found that \u201cinhabitants of more scenic environments report better health\u201d, but again this often comes back to the presence of nature. Indeed, neglected environments can contribute to mental ill-health \u2013 dilapidated neighbourhoods and abandoned shops or houses can make us feel unsafe, with run-down environments found to contribute to anxiety and persistent low mood. Though high-rise housing was initially commended for its views, larger rooms, sense of \u201curban privacy\u201d and efficient use of concrete, it was later suggested that the designs gave rise to various social and mental ills: increased crime, suicide rates and behavioural problems. High-floor dwellers were most at risk when it came to the negative impacts of such living environments because they were apparently most likely to isolate themselves. Such buildings were roundly condemned by JG Ballard, who felt that the \u201crapid turnover of acquaintances, the lack of involvement with others, and the total self-sufficiency of lives\u201d he saw in high-rises would allow \u201cthe psychotics\u201d to take over.  Though Ballard\u2019s doom-laden vision of high-rise living may seem compelling \u2013 especially considering the anti-social reputation of such estates \u2013 more recent research suggests that the buildings are not as intrinsically flawed as we might first imagine. Rather, the social ills found in such environments may be more closely related to poor maintenance than anything innate. Reports have found that \u201crisky\u201d facilities such as broken lights and windows, litter, graffiti and non-functioning CCTV may have more to do with increased crime rates \u2013 and anxiety-inducing fear of crime \u2013 than the physical environment itself. So mental ill-health may increase once the physical environment has deteriorated.      If shopping malls are well maintained and safe, they could have a positive impact on mental health. Photograph: Felipe Trueba/EPA    Southwark\u2019s Heygate Estate had a reputation for crime, despite crime rates that were half the average for the borough. Southwark council\u2019s director of regeneration claimed in 1999 that \u201csocial housing generates people on low incomes coming in, which generates poor school performances, and middle class people stay away\u201d. With attitudes like this, is it any surprise that tenants felt isolated and abandoned? Shopping centres also appear to refute the physical determinism of much environmental psychology. Often considered to be vast, unhealthy behemoths designed to disorient and dazzle us into spending money we don\u2019t have, shopping malls could, in fact, be beneficial to individual and societal wellbeing. One team of researchers argues shopping centres may possess \u201cmentally restorative qualities\u201d that could rival even natural settings. Again it suggests that healthy factors \u2013 greenery, a focus on safety, good maintenance, a sense of openness \u2013 could significantly reduce stress, no matter how buildings themselves are designed or interpreted. This isn\u2019t always the case; privatised public spaces like shopping malls often limit activity and use design to control behaviour. Though these spaces may feel and seem as if they are public, they are privately owned, meaning that our rights and behaviours are constricted and controlled. This in turn can contribute to a sense of anxiety.     Would living \u2018Sky City\u2019 in Changsha feel claustrophobic? Photograph: Feature China/Barcroft Media    What about buildings that claim to be cities in themselves? In China, the proposed development of a \u201cSky City\u201d \u2013 which was supposed to combine natural green spaces with homes, hotels, offices, shops, schools and a hospital in one building \u2013 was an attempt to create a living environment that both encourages tenant wellbeing as well as improving sustainability and providing efficient use of space. Gensler\u2019s Shanghai Tower, which is set to open to the public soon, has incorporated restaurants, shops, homes, offices and even parks inside a consciously pro-social spiral glass shell. Visiting a park two floors down from your flat might sound convenient, but can it really replace the health benefits of a stroll in a natural green space? Going to school in the same building you live in could save time, but it also sounds like a limiting, claustrophobic and homogenous experience. In terms of workspaces, McCay describes Coca Cola\u2019s new Tokyo headquarters, designed by Japanese architectural firm JMA, as an impressive example of design that combines good architecture with mindfully positive environmental features. The company has established bike parking so that employees cycle rather than drive to work, the building is full of natural light, and co-working spaces have replaced traditional cube-style office working spaces.  Ongoing debates aside, physical environment can only determine so much. Biological and social factors are still major drivers of mental ill-health, whether clinical or not.  \u201cGenetics, early experiences, family relationships and social settings can\u2019t be addressed through urban design,\u201d McCay explains. \u201cBut urban design can and should play a role, just as it does for physical disorders, which have equally complex causes.\u201d Increasingly, buildings and public spaces are being designed \u2013 or at the very least, critically analysed \u2013 with mental wellbeing in mind. A small number of collectives and centres have been established to examine the ways urban spaces intersect with mental health, and architects and policymakers are slowly becoming more mindful of the ways their projects impact on the health and happiness of city-dwellers.  With anti-stigma campaigns and increased media visibility bringing mental health to the forefront of the cultural landscape, there\u2019s a clear case for policymakers to take it into consideration when designing public spaces. But experts believe guidelines for healthy urban environments are currently failing to take this growing awareness into consideration. Alan Penn, dean of the Bartlett faculty of the built environment at University College London, believes that policymakers and architects are not dealing with mental health sufficiently because \u201cunderstanding of these issues is not yet mainstream\u201d in the architectural community.   Related: Where is the world's most stressful city?    McCay is optimistic, and believes that opportunities to improve mental health will become \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and \u201can expected component of the value of any design for buildings and public spaces\u201d. \u201cDesigning spaces to promote good mental health \u2013 and to support people with mental health problems \u2013 is an integral part of building a sustainable city,\u201d she says.  \u201cGood mental health can improve our enjoyment of life, our coping skills and relationships, our educational achievement, employment, housing and economic potential, help reduce physical health problems, ease the demand for healthcare and social care, build social capital, decrease suicides; and help people to live together in a positive, productive, cost-effective and ultimately happy way.

In July Xu, 25, announced on the Chinese social media website Weibo she had lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system that best responds to chemotherapy as a first-line treatment.  However, Xu said the high cost of chemotherapy in China and her fears about side effects and pain meant she had decided to treat her cancer with a mix of Chinese therapies instead.   Related: China's anti-pollution tech is going premium, but it can't make dirty air go away    \u201cNo matter how long I live, I want to enjoy every day happily,\u201d she wrote, adding that she did not want to \u201clet chemotherapy torment me to the point where there\u2019s no beauty and talent left\u201d. The actress appeared on television in the series Dad Home and acted in the comedy Lost In Macau. Later in July, Xu posted photos to Weibo of the aftermath of some of the alternative treatments she had undergone, including acupuncture and cupping, which involves placing a flammable substance into a cup, typically a cotton bud, and setting it on fire. As the fire goes out, the cup is placed upside down on the skin, usually the back, creating a vacuum and leaving welts on the body.  Some users begged her to seek chemotherapy. One user wrote on her Weibo page: \u201cYou need to rely on modern medicine to save yourself.\u201d The American Cancer Society guide to complementary and alternative therapies warns of the risk of burns from cupping and states that \u201cavailable scientific evidence does not support claims that cupping has any health benefits\u201d. Along with cupping, used by the swimmer Michael Phelps, Xu also turned to gua sha, a treatment that involves scraping the skin with a tool, and which is practised by the actor Gwyneth Paltrow. It left Xu with red marks and bruising down her neck. \u201cFrankly, traditional Chinese medicine is also painful,\u201d Xu wrote as a caption underneath one of the images of the treatment she posted to her blog.  According to a study published in the journal Complementary Therapies in Medicine, gua sha users in Hong Kong tended to use it mostly to treat respiratory and pain problems. In August, Xu\u2019s sister encouraged her to undergo chemotherapy as she became more unwell. Xu died on 7 September, shortly after starting chemotherapy.  Her death has sparked a debate in the Chinese media about the use and effectiveness of Chinese therapies. On the Chinese news website people.cn, the head of the traditional Chinese medicine department at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, Dr Feng Li, wrote that Chinese therapies should not be blamed for Xu\u2019s death. He wrote that \u201cwhile western approaches like radiology, chemotherapy, and surgery are effective in shrinking the tumour\u201d, Chinese therapies were \u201ceffective in reducing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and pain that comes with western treatment\u201d.  \u201cMoreover, after the tumour is under control, traditional Chinese medicine helps to repair the immune system, accelerate the body\u2019s recovery and minimise the chance of the tumour returning.\u201d  A 2014 review of complementary and alternative medicine for cancer pain found alternative treatments, including Chinese treatments, had \u201clow or moderate\u201d evidence for alleviating cancer pain. But a peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Cancer and Oncology Pain described the barriers some people faced obtaining conventional medical treatment. Led by Dr David Garfield from the ProMed Cancer Centre in Shanghai, the authors wrote that \u201cMainland Chinese attitudes are different from what we are accustomed to in the west\u201d.    Related: China investigates Baidu after death of student who sought cancer cure on internet    \u201cThere is a lack of trust between patients/families and physicians, related in part to there being few urban general practitioners, resulting in no longstanding, physician-patient relationships,\u201d the authors wrote.  \u201cThere is a feeling that care is being provided for personal gain, much more so than in the west.

Tuesday TV audiences have inevitably been smaller for the Paralympics than last month\u2019s Olympics, which is a shame because there\u2019s no doubt the games have showcased plenty of sporting brilliance. Consider, for example, the T13 1500m men\u2019s final, won by the Algerian Abdellatif Baka in a world record time of 3:48.29. Ethiopia\u2019s Tamiru Demisse and Kenyan Henry Kirwa claimed silver and bronze, while Baka\u2019s brother Fouad just missed a medal in fourth.  Runners in the T13 category are visually impaired, which makes it particularly striking that each of the first four finishers, had they been competing in the Olympics 1500m final on 20 August, would have beaten the entire field, including Matt Centrowitz who claimed gold for the US in a snail-like time of 3:50.00. The American\u2019s victory came in a highly tactical race that got off to an unusually slow start, but still. Did someone say \u201cbackwards and in heels\u201d? Wednesday A big week for food-based transportation calamity headline gags, which \u2013 speaking personally \u2013 has been just about the only thing that has got me through. First, of course, there was the embarrassing pasta disaster on the A5 near Shotatton in Shropshire, where a lorry slopped 20 tonnes of spaghetti bolognese across the carriageway. Then came that incident with the tanker transporting molasses off the Cumbrian coast which \u2013 dear reader, you are ahead of me \u2013 got stuck.  Is it just possible, all the same, that we have overindulged just a little on the food puns with the news that a baking programme is moving channels? I mean, crumbs, newspapers do like to rise to the challenge when faced with these ingredients, but whether we kneaded quite so many overcooked puns about the Great British Bake Off\u2019s BBC1 departure is a matter of taste. Let\u2019s all agree: the BBC got burned, Mel and Sue were delicious and Breadxit means Breadxit. Now can we leave it there? I\u2019m feeling queasy. Thursday So we are, after all, to have a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, after May declined to overturn her predecessor\u2019s bafflingly unfavourable deal with its Chinese backers. For all their glee at the Hinkley contract, the real prize for Chinese investors is a potential new plant at Bradwell, on a sparse stretch of coast near Maldon in Essex. Bradwell, as it happens, has been of interest to incomers for some time. Just east of the power station site is a small stone building that could pass for a ramshackle old barn. It is, instead, the chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall, built by St Cedd, a missionary from Lindisfarne, in 654, which makes it probably the second oldest church in Britain. Cedd\u2019s builder-monks reused stones from the Roman fort of Othona, and the tiny, single-roomed chapel stands at the end of an arrow-straight stretch of Roman road, with just the North Sea behind. It feels like a miraculous survival from another time, perched on the very edge of the world. Do visit before the chaps in radiation suits and the three-eyed fish take over.  Friday Sometimes life writes its own punchlines. So it must seem, at least, for Rebecca Moss, who sailed from Vancouver last month on board a container ship bound for Shanghai. Moss, 25, is an \u201cabsurdist artist\u201d and her project \u201c23 Days at Sea\u201d was intended to examine the comedic friction between mechanical systems and nature. In a textbook case of \u201cbe careful what you wish for\u201d, however, the Hanjin Shipping Company, which owns the tanker, went bust on 31 August, leaving the ship stranded at sea since port operators, afraid they won\u2019t be paid, have refused to let them dock. Meat and drink for an absurdist artist, one might think. Maybe so, but when contacted by email on Friday for an update, it was clear the comedy of the situation was wearing thin for Moss. She is looking forward, she said, to \u201cbeing out of this situation and to be in a position to reflect back on it. When you are in it, the stress is hard to manage.\u201d Friday was the day she was due to disembark; her plan was to spend a few days with collaborators in Shanghai before flying home to London. \u201cNow this is looking somewhat unlikely.\u201d Quite enough absurdity for one lifetime.

When those writers ponder how wealthy countries turned towards the politics of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, they should devote a large chapter to Apple.

Related: In the rush for the latest gimmick, we are losing the joy of \u2018things\u2019    Whatever marvels have been shoved into the new iPhones, the devices serve to increase the gulf between the super-rich and the rest of us, bilk countries of rightful tax revenues, and oppress Chinese workers even while depriving Americans of high-paying jobs. Arrogant towards critics and governments, glutted with cash and yet plainly out of ideas, Apple is elegant shorthand for a redundant economic system. None of this is how we\u2019re meant to think of Apple, the multinational that is both on your side yet restlessly questing ahead. While launching the iPhone 7 this month, its marketing chief, Phil Schiller, explained why this model came without a earphone socket: \u201cIt really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on, do something new, that betters all of us.\u201d Such patchouli-scented Californian dipshittery was lapped up by the 7,000-strong crowd and lightly mocked by the press \u2013 but it also helps to obscure some of the less tolerable aspect of the iPhone business model, such as the conditions in which it is made. If you own an iPhone it was assembled by workers at one of three firms in China: Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron. The biggest and most famous, Foxconn, came to international prominence in 2010 when an estimated 18 of its employees tried to kill themselves. At least 14 workers died. The company\u2019s response was to put up suicide nets, to catch people trying to jump to their death. That year, staff at Foxconn\u2019s Longhua factory made 137,000 iPhones a day, or around 90 a minute. One of those attempted suicides, a 17-year-old called Tian Yu, flung herself from the fourth floor of a factory dormitory and ended up paralysed from the waist down. Speaking later to academic researchers, she described her working conditions in remarkable testimony that I then covered for the Guardian. She was essentially a human battery hen, working over 12 hours a day, six days a week, swapped between day and night shifts and kept in an eight-person dorm room. After the scandals of 2010, Apple vowed to improve conditions for its Chinese workers. It has since published a number of glossy brochures extolling its commitments to them. Yet there is no evidence that the Californian firm has given back a single penny of its gigantic profit margins to its contractors to ensure better treatment of the people who actually make its products. Over the past year, the US-based NGO China Labor Watch has published a series of investigations into Pegatron, another iPhone assembler. It sent a researcher on to the assembly line, interviewed dozens of Pegatron staff and analysed hundreds of pay stubs. Among its findings are that staff still work 12 hours a day, six days a week \u2013 one and a half hours of that unpaid. They are forced to do overtime, claims the NGO, and provided with illegally low levels of safety training. The researcher was working on one iPhone motherboard every 3.75 seconds, standing up for the entirety of his 10.5-hour shift. Such is the punishment endured at Apple\u2019s contractors to make a living wage, apparently.     Tim Cook with dancer Maddie Ziegler. The Apple CEO \u2018rejects a \u20ac13bn tax bill from the EU as \u2018political crap\u2019\u2019. Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images    The Shanghai local government has raised the minimum wage over the past year; Pegatron has responded by cutting subsidies on things such as medical insurance so that the effective hourly pay for its staff has fallen. When questioned about these reports, Pegatron provided a statement that read in part: \u201cWe work hard to make sure every Pegatron facility provides a healthy work environment and allegations suggesting otherwise are simply not true \u2026 We have taken effective measures \u2026 to ensure employees do not work more than 60 hours per week and six days per week.\u201d At another of Apple\u2019s major contractors, Wistron, a Danish human-rights NGO last year found extensive evidence of forced student labour. Teenagers doing degrees in accountancy or business management were sent for months to an assembly line at Wistron. This is a serious violation of International Labour Organisation convention, yet investigators for Danwatch found evidence that thousands of students were doing the same work and backbreaking hours there as the adults \u2013 but costing less. The teenagers told Danwatch that they were working against their will. \u201cWe are all depressed,\u201d one 19-year-old girl said. \u201cBut we have no choice, because the school told us that if we refused, we would not get our diploma.\u201d Despite several requests for comment, Wistron did not respond. That investigation was not at a factory making iPhones, but Apple confirmed that Wistron and Pegatron were two of their major assemblers in China. While it did not wish to say anything on the record, Apple\u2019s press officers pointed me to the audits it had commissioned into its supplier factories. Yet the inspections are almost conveniently skimpy. Look at the report Apple commissioned into Foxconn in 2012, after those suicide attempts. Foxconn is the largest private employer in China, with around 400,000 workers at the Longhua factory alone. Yet the report for Apple, complementary to an investigation already being carried out by the Fair Labor Association, admits to looking at just three of those plants for three days apiece. Jenny Chan, one of the foremost scholars of Chinese labour abuses and co-author of the forthcoming Dying for an iPhone, calls it \u201cparachute auditing \u2013 a way to allow \u2018business as usual\u2019 to carry on\u201d. A very profitable way, as it happens. While iPhone workers for Pegatron saw their hourly pay drop to just $1.60 an hour, Apple remained the most profitable big company in America, pulling in over $47bn in profit in 2015 alone.   Related: Apple ordered to pay up to \u20ac13bn after EU rules Ireland broke state aid laws    What does this add up to? At $231bn, Apple has a bigger cash pile than the US government, but apparently won\u2019t spend even a sliver on improving conditions for those who actually make its money. Nor will it make those iPhones in America, which would create jobs and still leave it as the most profitable smartphone in the world. It would rather accrue more profits, to go to those who hold Apple stock \u2013 such as company boss Tim Cook, whose hoard of company shares is worth $785m. Friends of Cook point to his philanthropy, but while he\u2019s happy to spend on pet projects, he rejects a \u20ac13bn tax bill from the EU as \u201cpolitical crap\u201d \u2013 while boasting about how he won\u2019t bring Apple\u2019s billions back to the US \u201cuntil there\u2019s a fair rate \u2026 It doesn\u2019t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are.\u201d The tech oligarch seems to think he knows better than 300 million Americans what tax rates their elected government should set. When the historians of globalisation ask why it died, they will surely find that companies such as Apple form a large part of the answer. Faced with a binary choice between an economic model that lavishly rewarded a few and a populism that makes lavish promises to many, between Cook on the one hand and Farage on the other, the voters went for the one who at least didn\u2019t bang on about \u201ccourage\u201d.", "tags": ["Apple", "China", "iPhone 7", "US news"], "publicationDate": "2016-09-19T19:26:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/emma-walmsley-profile-loreal-gsk-chief-designate-glaxosmithkline", "sentences": ["In her last job at the French cosmetics company, Walmsley ran the company\u2019s Chinese consumer products business out of Shanghai for three years, overseeing global brands including L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, Maybelline and Garnier, as well as Mininurse, a Chinese skincare brand."], "title": "Emma Walmsley profile: from marketing at L'Or\u00e9al to GSK chief", "article": "Emma Walmsley is in line to become one of just seven female CEOs in the FTSE 100, having been named as chief executive designate of Britain\u2019s biggest drugs company.

Investors gave a lukewarm response to the appointment of the 47-year-old, thought to be one of four internal candidates for the top job and someone with a marketing and consumer products \u2013 rather than scientific \u2013 background. Shares dropped 0.4% after the announcement. Walmsley joined GSK in 2010 after 17 years at L\u2019Or\u00e9al.

At L\u2019Or\u00e9al, she held a variety of marketing and general management roles in the UK, Europe, the US, and China. In her last job at the French cosmetics company, Walmsley ran the company\u2019s Chinese consumer products business out of Shanghai for three years, overseeing global brands including L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, Maybelline and Garnier, as well as Mininurse, a Chinese skincare brand.  At the time of her move to GSK in 2010, Advertising Age quoted company insiders surprised at her departure from L\u2019Or\u00e9al, where she was tipped for a senior global management role.  Walmsley was 33rd in Fortune\u2019s 2016 list of the most powerful women outside the US \u2013 she can expect a higher ranking next year after landing the top job at GSK.  She has kept a relatively low media profile, although she has revealed that she enjoys yoga and, in a GSK corporate video, said she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like the pomposity of big business language and excessive PowerPoints\u201d.     Walmsley will replace Sir Andrew Witty when he retires in March. Photograph: GlaxoSmithKline/PA    Analysts believe her consumer products background probably safeguards the future of the consumer business in GSK for the time being, at a time when some investors favour a break-up of the group. The consumer healthcare division accounts for 25% of GSK\u2019s revenues, with vaccines accounting for about 15% and the main pharmaceuticals business accounting for the rest.  Walmsley currently leads 21,000 workers in the business, which makes over-the-counter pain relief drugs such as Panadol, toothpaste brands including Sensodyne and Aquafresh, as well as cold and flu and smoking cessation products. When she takes on the top role at GSK, she will have a global workforce of 100,000. As manager of the Allianz UK equity income fund, Simon Gergel has a 6% stake in GSK, and says investor reaction to Walmsley\u2019s appointment will be mixed. It was positive for those who support the existing strategy of diversification, and negative for those who would prefer a demerger of the consumer arm, he said.  \u201cOverall, the move reduces any dividend/strategy risk an outsider may have posed and suggests that GSK\u2019s new CEO will continue to build on the legacy of her predecessor Sir Andrew Witty.\u201d Walmsley is likely to look again at group strategy. The biggest challenges include the pressure on drugs makers to reduce prices, particularly in the US, as well as increased competition in generic drugs.

Before Wednesday night\u2019s EFL Cup trip to Swansea City Guardiola said Tour\u00e9 would never play again for the club unless his agent, Dimitri Seluk, offered an apology. The Ivorian was bemused to find out via the media rather than be informed personally by Guardiola of his changed status. Despite having featured only once this term \u2013 in August\u2019s Champions League play-off second-leg against Steaua Bucharest (when City were already 5-0 up from the first leg) \u2013 Tour\u00e9 had been training conscientiously and was determined to force his way back into the Catalan\u2019s first-team plans. The 33-year-old is understood to have caused no friction at the club despite his lack of playing time and Guardiola has stated more than once that Tour\u00e9 has been no problem.   Related: Yaya Tour\u00e9 free to leave Manchester City for any Premier League club    On Tuesday the manager called him a \u201cgood guy\u201d but was clear Seluk has to say sorry to the club, the other players, and Guardiola for claiming the 45-year-old disrespected Tour\u00e9 when leaving him out of the 25-man Champions League squad. This took Tour\u00e9 by surprise and the player is disappointed at how he has been treated by Guardiola given his professional attitude, believing he should not be penalised for the actions of Seluk. As he was caught unaware by the manager\u2019s announcement Tour\u00e9 has given no thought to his future and if he might now leave in the January transfer window. Tour\u00e9 is free to join any Premier League club then, with City prepared to allow the midfielder to leave for a direct rival. The hierarchy would countenance the Ivorian moving to another domestic team even if they are challenging City for the title. The view at the Etihad Stadium is that at 33, Tour\u00e9\u2019s best days are behind him and so if the midfielder were to attract interest he would be unlikely to damage City\u2019s chances of success. There is an outside prospect he could play for City again and see out a contract worth \u00a3220,000-a-week that finishes next June. This means he can sign a pre-contract agreement from January to join a new club in the summer. Internazionale were intent on signing him last summer but Tour\u00e9 decided against the move despite the prospect of playing again under Roberto Mancini, who has since left the Italian club. The midfielder also rejected the chance last summer to join two Chinese sides, Shanghai SIPG and Jiangsu Suning, in deals that would have been worth around \u00a330m to him. As Tour\u00e9 also retired from international football with the Ivory Coast on Tuesday there is the prospect of him playing no football at all until next season unless he does depart City in January. Even if Seluk were to apologise it appears unlikely Tour\u00e9 will become a regular in the first-team again, so his career at the club may be materially over whatever occurs in the future. Since Tour\u00e9 to joined City from Barcelona in the summer of 2010 the Ivorian has been an integral part of the club\u2019s recent success. In 2011 he scored the winners in the semi-final and final of the FA Cup to secure City a first major trophy since 1976. Tour\u00e9 was also the driving forced in each of the Premier League title triumphs in 2012 and 2014, while also being part of the League Cup-winning sides in 2016 and two years before.

As Hollywood expansionist strategy makes clear, most film-industry insiders believe that China is where the money is, and will be. Despite a recent dip in takings, the Chinese box office is expected to outgross the US\u2019s in 2017 for the first time: projections suggest that Chinese cinemas will earn $10.4bn, as opposed to $10.2bn in the US. In February, the huge totals for the Stephen Chow film The Mermaid helped China\u2019s monthly gross \u2013 $1.05bn \u2013 surpass that of all of North America (including Canada), which was $790m for the same period. China is moving towards Hollywood, too. In an effort spearheaded by billionaire Wang Jianlin, the Dalian Wanda Group has been investing in anything that is for sale in Tinseltown, including Batman producers Legendary Entertainment and the cinema chain AMC, and is currently angling to acquire Paramount. Meanwhile, Hollywood increasingly has to comply with China\u2019s written and unwritten regulations, and make countless compromises, to produce audience-pleasing blockbusters that satisfy the censors. And in order to bypass the quota that China sets for foreign movies (34 a year), US studios have started to make co-productions with Chinese ones \u2013 adapting further to China\u2019s requests, censorship and regulations in order to do so.          Trailer for the box office record-breaking Stephen Chow film The Mermaid.    It is an exercise fraught with unexpected consequences, as the Hong Kong film industry \u2013 until recently one of the most productive and vibrant in the world \u2013 knows only too well. If Hong Kong\u2019s experience is anything to go by, it will mean that, according to the director Johnnie To, \u201cthe type of films that the public will be able to see will shrink\u201d. To, one of Hong Kong\u2019s most famous and established film-makers, who is best known in the west for his Election series, adds: \u201cEveryone who makes expensive films will have to make compromises, because China is where the money is. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d    Related: Ten Years \u2013 the terrifying vision of Hong Kong that Beijing wants obscured    Hong Kong\u2019s pre-eminent position in the Chinese-language film industry dates back to China\u2019s civil war in the 1930s and 40s, between Mao Zedong\u2019s communist forces and Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s nationalists. Whole studios emigrated from Shanghai (formerly China\u2019s film-making centre) and settled in what was then a British colony. Hong Kong produced Mandarin- and Cantonese-language movies until the 1960s; gradually thereafter, Cantonese began to dominate. But language seemed almost irrelevant: Hong Kong cinema had entered its golden era, and, as Shu Kei, film critic and professor at the Academy of Performing Arts in Hong Kong, recalls, \u201cactors would be busy on nearly 10 sets in a single day\u201d.  \u201cThe golden era had an output of up to 250 films a year, and the slowdown only started in the 90s,\u201d says Kei. \u201cQuality was problematic, but the craze was such that cinemas were screening movies at a slightly faster pace, in order to squeeze in one extra show, while film directors and actors just improvised with no script.\u201d Profits were so high that organised crime became an active part of the industry.     Brigitte Lin in Chungking Express (1994) Photograph: Ronald Grant    But in the late 90s, just at the point at which audiences became more discriminating and DVDs started to eat into profits, China began opening up, changing the game entirely. Hong Kong\u2019s movie stars were highly attractive and recognisable, but to remain relevant, Hong Kong cinema had to shift its attention to mainland audiences, and cut back on some of its more eccentric traits. \u201cWhen Wong Kar Wai shot Chungking Express in 1994, Brigitte Lin was dressed up in a wig, sunglasses and a raincoat because she was busy on a period movie set, and had no time to go through makeup and costume again. But it worked!\u201d says Shu Kei with a giggle. That era was soon over.  \u201cThe first movie I shot in China was in the 80s, and I required no permits to film there. I didn\u2019t need to submit my script either,\u201d recalls Mabel Cheung, another of Hong Kong\u2019s most important auteur film makers. \u201cI needed to shoot in China for my trilogy on illegal migrants, and the only issue was people crowding the set as they were so excited to see Hong Kong film stars. Sammo Hung was the male lead, and that meant we were followed around all the way into the hotel, and filming was a challenge.\u201d  Some years later, Cheung was back in China filming a major historical drama, The Soong Sisters (1997), based on the real-life story of three sisters married to three of the most important men in modern Chinese history \u2013 the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, China\u2019s first president Sun Yat-sen, and HH Kung, China\u2019s first finance minister. It was a co-production with the Beijing Film Studio. \u201cI had to submit the script and get permission, but the Chinese film industry at the time was not strong: money had to be entirely provided by us, and they supplied the crew and the film studio. But when we submitted the film to the censorship bureau, we were told we had to go to the Important Affairs Commission, since it was a historical movie.\u201d It ended up with Cheung losing the last 18 minutes of her movie, in spite of her long pleadings with the censors\u2019 office: \u201cI never got my ending back. I had to reconstruct an ending I could live with from leftover material they agreed to return. They said it was not possible for Soong Mei-ling and Soong Ai-ling to hug, because one was married to a nationalist and the other to the father of the nation; so we had an argument about history. But I managed to get my film, and [Chinese] mainland distribution.\u201d While waiting however, Cheung filmed Beijing Rocks (2001), about the Chinese capital\u2019s booming underground music scene. \u201cThat got banned,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I could take it to Hong Kong, and after that I could go back to China. At the time they banned the movie, not the person.\u201d   Related: A bigger splash: how did The Mermaid become China's biggest ever film?    Like any foreign territory, Hong Kong was also subject to a yearly quota. Then, while the former colony was recovering from the devastating economic effects of the Sars epidemic in 2003, Beijing announced the establishment of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA, a free-trade agreement which granted preferential access for Hong Kong films to the Chinese market. It proved a watershed moment for Hong Kong cinema.         Infernal Affairs (2002), directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak.    However, as China\u2019s economic clout grew, the censors got more confident. In 2002, Hong Kong\u2019s filmgoers were queuing up to see Infernal Affairs, co-directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak \u2013 the beginning of a double-agent cop trilogy in the greatest tradition, with an exhilarating succession of twists. To break into the mainland market, it had three different endings for the censors to choose from. \u201cIn a mainland China movie, you cannot have a bad guy who gets away with his crimes,\u201d explains film-maker Jevons Au. \u201cMultiple endings to suit the mainland market used to be OK. No more. Now, if you want to distribute in China, you must have only one approved ending worldwide. You can step on the line. But you cannot cross it.\u201d Au knows all about being banned: he is one of the five co-directors of Ten Years, a politically uncompromising dystopian tale which imagines Hong Kong under an ever-more repressive regime. All five have been banned from China, despite Ten Years winning best film at the Hong Kong film awards and being feted in critics\u2019 circles as the harbinger of a local renaissance in small-budget productions that talk to local audiences, and are not geared to grossing millions in China.  \u201cFor us, it is complicated,\u201d says Au. \u201cThe uniqueness of Hong Kong is our freedom of speech, of creativity, of expression. You can do and say anything you want. To make a co-production with China, you have to follow ever stricter rules: half of the cast and crew has to be Chinese. The censors have the last word. Crime stories cannot have too many details. Stories of corruption must end with the bad guy behind bars. No ghosts. No gay love stories. No religion. No nudity. No politics\u2026\u201d He counts on his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a trap. The moment you fall into it, you change. You hurt your creativity.\u201d  Other films suggest, however, that obstacles can stimulate creativity, and not necessarily crush it. Director Stephen Chow shifted his operation to China, and had enormous box office success. The Mermaid became the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time. And it got around the prohibition of films about the supernatural by reclassifying itself as a science-fiction movie. Likewise, Barbara Wong Chun-Chun, who started her career as an independent film-maker with thought-provoking movies such as Women\u2019s Private Parts (2000), a documentary discussion of female sexuality, has now abandoned small-budget productions to make some of the most successful Chinese movies. Her film The Secret (2016) is a love story among what seem to be ghosts, but could get into theatres thanks to its final line: when one of the characters wakes up from a coma, she asks if she dreamed it all.         Was it all just a dream? \u2026 The Secret (2016), directed by Barbara Wong Chun-Chun.    \u201cYou have to try to understand China\u2019s censorship,\u201d says Wong. \u201cIn Hong Kong you have category I, II and III movies. In China, there is no such system. So you must make movies that a five year old can watch without feeling scared. Can you make a movie with a bad cop in it in China? Of course. But then he has to end up in jail. Can you have much blood? No. A kid is going to see it. Foreigners who want to make movies in China need to understand the country first.\u201d \u201cSay you want to make a film about corruption,\u201d Wong continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive theme. But the regulations are blurry, you can tackle things in a different way: shoot a film where the corruption is in America, not in China. Then it\u2019s OK. As an artist, you must find ways of getting around it.\u201d Another limitation is established by Chinese moviegoers\u2019 own tastes. Roger Garcia, executive director of the Hong Kong film festival, says: \u201cIn China, you are making either a romance or a big special-effects movie. If you want to do horror, or other genres, you cannot be in China. You can make a budget sci-fi movie in Hollywood, but Chinese audiences will not like that. They like huge, costly productions. So I think that China should not be the total sum of everything, it is a mistake. It is limiting. For Hong Kong, it was a mistake to obsess about China. And things are changing now that Hollywood is doing the same.\u201d Johnnie To agrees that film-makers are presented with a difficult choice: \u201cYou have to recognise that China is way more open now. The first film I shot there was in 1978 \u2013 the change is obvious, very big.\u201d Milkyway Image, his production company in Kwun Tong, the movie district of Hong Kong, has produced films that have been allowed into the mainland, as well as others that were banned \u2013 like the recent Trivisa (2016), co-directed by Ten Years\u2019 Jevons Au.  \u201cFirst of all,\u201d says To, \u201cyou must ask yourself: can China accept this movie? We are different in Hong Kong, we are free, we can do and say what we want. Not them. So, you must be prepared to accept their point of view. But you cannot escape this fact: today, if you want to make a big budget movie, you can no longer make it only for Hong Kong.         Trivisia (2016), directed by Johnny To and Jevons Au, has been banned in China.     \u201cDoes it mean compromises? Yes, very many. But the alternative is no movie in China. There are many political issues that China is still stuck with, because it has an old-fashioned system of government, and even if there is more freedom than there used to be, the Communist party is unable to relax. Yet you see it very clearly \u2013 everybody is ready to shut up to make money.\u201d  Despite To\u2019s high profile, some of his films were denied a release in China. Neither Election (2005) nor Election 2 (2006), which deal with power struggles in a triad gang, made it. \u201cI am going to wait until I am 65 to make Election 3,\u201d says To, now 61, \u201cas I already know that, after that, I will be banned from China. But it will be OK: I\u2019ll be able to really describe the rot in our government through that film.\u201d While film industries from Hollywood and Italy to the UK and India continue to court this booming source of revenue, To is not optimistic about cinema. \u201cTo make it really big, a film has to be one the Chinese censors can approve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe range of films that the world will get to see will be restricted.\u201d", "tags": ["Film industry", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture", "China", "Censorship", "Arts funding", "Hong Kong", "Freedom of speech"], "publicationDate": "2016-09-22T08:49:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/23/abstract-expressionism-jackson-pollock-paula-rego-victoria-beckham-week-in-art", "sentences": ["Photograph: Ying Ji    This is taken from Prisoner of Childhood, a collection of Ying Ji\u2019s work recently on show in Shanghai."], "title": "Jackson Pollock, Paula Rego and Victoria Beckham \u2013\u00a0the week in art", "article": "Exhibition of the week Abstract Expressionism Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Willem de Kooning \u2026 some of the greatest art of the modern age crosses the Atlantic to awe us with its all-embracing sublimity.

That city\u2019s breathtaking waterfront parks are host to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Museum of Science and Industry \u2013 a solid majority of the city\u2019s premier cultural institutions. It came as little surprise that George Lucas and other backers then chose a lakefront site for his proposed Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. Yet in 2016 their proposal prompted fierce opposition and a lawsuit from a local nonprofit group, Friends of the Parks, that eventually sent the museum all the way to California in search of a home. Less than two months later, the desired location for the Obama Presidential Library was announced \u2013 in lakefront Jackson Park. Friends of the Parks won\u2019t be filing a lawsuit against this proposal \u2013 but they are once again opposed. Times have changed.  Across the ocean there\u2019s a very different museum shift underway, as the London Design Museum, which opened in 1989 in a former Banana ripening warehouse along the Shad Thames, has just completed a move to the former Commonwealth Foundation building in bustling Kensington. The Design Museum\u2019s director, Deyan Sudjic, said: \u201cWhen the museum opened on the Thames in 1989, it was a classic piece of dockland dereliction. By the time we left it had come to life as a place where people lived, worked and came to enjoy the riverside setting.\u201d  For all of the dubious attention attracted by the \u201cBilbao Effect\u201d theory \u2013 the idea that an iconic cultural structure can rechart a city\u2019s fortunes and public image, as with as Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim \u2013 a more prosaic, and arguably more important aspect of museum location has received little attention: not which city a museum is built in, but where in that city. Locations that would once have seemed inevitable, such as Chicago parkland, are hugely contentious in the 2000s, while locations previously unthinkable in that year \u2013 an abandoned lumbermill in Bilbao, or, say, a disused warehouse on the Thames \u2013 are now commonplace.      The proposed Lucas Museum of Narrative Art on Chicago\u2019s waterfront. Photograph: Courtesy: MAD architects    Like any search for a home, these issues often reveal as much about their tenants as about real estate, and the way they have shifted over time sheds considerable light on the evolving character of museums themselves. An Unwelcome Neighbour The contemporary museum\u2019s antecedents \u2013 in the palace and the temple \u2013 are clear in the museums along Chicago\u2019s lakefront, all emblematic of City Beautiful trend that pervaded urban planning in the turn-of-the-century United States. There\u2019s hardly an American art museum built during this period that wasn\u2019t neoclassical in style and located in a park or directly adjacent to one; these pastoral quarters were designed to offer contemplative settings and a contemplative remove for the chaos of inner-city commerce. While these museums had their separate backers and supporters, a real cluster emerged by the 1930s close to the Chicago Loop, an aspirational acropolis officially labeled the \u201cMuseum Campus\u201d since 1998.  When George Lucas\u2019s original aim to establish the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in San Francisco\u2019s Presidio fell through, he looked to move into this esteemed neighbourhood. The museum is designed to contain a wide range of materials, both from Lucas\u2019s own cinematic work and his substantial art collection.  The city of Chicago greeted this proposal enthusiastically, with Mayor Rahm Emanuel offering a plot of land near the Chicago Bears stadium, Soldier Field. Its progress was initially easy \u2013 the Park District Board approved a 99-year lease, the City Council approved the proposal \u2013 but then the museum hit a substantial roadblock rooted in the ambiguous legal status of museums on public land.     The Guggenheim Bilbao has given rise to the notion that a standout cultural attraction can reshape a city\u2019s image. Photograph: Kenneth Garrett/National Geographic/Getty    Friends of the Parks, a Chicago nonprofit group, took rapid objection. As a press release read: \u201cChicago\u2019s citizens are witnessing an aggressive assault on their public parks, led by the current Administration\u2019s desire to exploit the city\u2019s greatest natural open space assets for development.\u201d They filed a lawsuit in November 2014, claiming the proposal violated public trust laws by granting civic land to a private organisation. The city\u2019s efforts to dismiss the suit failed in February when District Court Judge John Darrah ruled the museum proposal to be \u201cnot for the benefit of the public but will impair public interest in the land\u201d.       The Tate Modern, in the refurbished Bankside Power Station, on London\u2019s South Bank. Photograph: Hayes Davidson/Tate Gallery./PA    Amid this impasse, Mayor Emanuel proposed an alternate lakefront location, involving demolishing part of the McCormick Convention Center, but state budget disputes rendered it unviable.  In June, Lucas, tiring of this effort, announced that the museum would no longer be considering Chicago as a location. \u201cNo one benefits from [Friends of the Parks] continuing their seemingly unending litigation to protect a parking lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actions initiated by Friends of Parks and their recent attempts to extract concessions from the city have effectively overridden approvals received from numerous democratically elected bodies of government.\u201d  The museums move Museums, and their locations, have changed much in the last century. There has been a turn away from bucolic sites and mock temples. Museums built in the mid-20th century were as likely to turn up in busy town centres, like the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney in Manhattan, or the Museum of London\u2019s brick-stove-like Barbican location. The notion of a \u201ccultural campus\u201d became a deliberate strategy, animated by the idea that the most logical neighbours of cultural facilities were similarly minded. These grew in Berlin\u2019s Kultuforum, in Fort Worth, in Houston, and countless other locations.  The nature of the museum\u2019s role began to change. G Stanley Hall, a turn-of-the-century psychologist, wrote about American museums in the age of Chicago\u2019s lakefront boom, characterising them as \u201can esoteric and aesthetic mausoleum of pictures, open on certain days of the week to a few people\u201d. In the age of the rising blockbuster exhibit and substantial efforts to increase ticket sales, museums were recast as mainstream tourist attractions brimming with auditoriums and event spaces, rather than destinations for occasional jaunts for the elite.     A visitor looks over the sculpture garden at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, located in a Manhattan tower block. Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters    Such shifts had a real impact on museum architecture in the burgeoning days of the \u201cstarchitect\u201d. The starchitect\u2019s favourite creation was surely the museum, rising out of so many locations in the 80s and 90s. As one eminent among their number, Michael Graves, commented at the Architectural League of New York in 1986: \u201cI think this is a moment in history where we have to realise we\u2019re not just building Kunsthalles or picture galleries. We\u2019re building institutions that have places for discussion, places for study, and a social climate as well as a climate in which to see painting and sculpture.\u201d The museum as a multimedia complex became commonplace, with theatres, shops, public spaces, obligatory. There was the early Centre Pompidou in Paris, and soon the crystal-cluster works from the likes of Santiago Calatrava, Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel and Zaha Hadid. This age of extravagant construction paradoxically saw a leap in previously unthinkable downmarket repurposing.  The rise of warehouse and other industrial spaces is a fascinating example of established and new museums following the lead of galleries whose occupation of industrial spaces was often a direct response to the fusty confines of traditional museums. Soon museums were seeking a similar edge. The Guggenheim SoHo was a failed initial effort to open a branch in a hip gallery district at almost precisely the point those galleries had been engulfed by luxury shopping. The Whitney relocation from the stuffy Upper East side to the Meatpacking District was a more successful instance of the same gambit, but a remarkable case of a museum chasing rather than attracting the frisson of a neighbourhood.  The factory for art     The London Design Museum, at the former Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. Photograph: Design Museum    Several decades into industrial adaptive use, some museums are now leaving those locations they helped repopulate and heading back to city centres. The London Design Museum\u2019s opening in a neglected warehouse area was a bold choice in 1989; now it is simply routine. Over time its surroundings grew vibrant, and its collection too large for its home. Their search for a new home was revealing. After helping to restore the Shad Thames to a lively condition, they sought a location more easily accessed by public transport and closer to other attractions \u2013 but not so close as to be dwarfed by one. As Sudjic commented: \u201cInitially we talked to the Tate about buying a strip of land behind the Turbine Hall, but we were not sure that the 5 million people a year who go to Tate would come and see us on the same visit.\u201d Eventually they settled on a more novel relocation: the traditional fabric of Kensington. It involved another reuse, but instead of a 1940s banana ripening warehouse, it was the 1962 former home of the Commonwealth Institute. The relocation, enabled by a John Pawson renovation, tripled their size, but its significance was greater than simply adding space.  Sudjic continued: \u201cMoving to Kensington does give us synergies with the other museums in the area, and with the Royal College of Art. It\u2019s a chance to grow our audience by offering them more and it will bring life back into what was once a thriving high street. In the 19th century Kensington was the Hoxton of its day, the place successful artists built their studios. In the 1960s it was at the heart of fashionable London.\u201d   Related: The Bilbao Effect: is 'starchitecture' all it\u2019s cracked up to be? A history of cities in 50 buildings, day 27    The concept of the museum as a standalone destination, magnetic enough to overcome any difficulty in access or absence of nearby attraction, has not quite faded: the Lucas Museum may end up somewhere dramatically remote \u2013 an island in San Francisco Bay has been mentioned. Yet imperatives of both city planners and curators have been inclining towards urban convenience, and towards similar neighbours in easily accessible locations, which might well be convenient industrial brownfields or refurbished buildings, high streets, historic lakefronts, or active downtowns. At the same time, in the choppy wake of Bilbaomania a museum cannot always rely on subservient authorities to steamroll opposition: the Obama Library has been more fortunate than the Lucas Museum but the mixed receptions to both have made clear that a new museum will not always be received as a gift-wrapped treasure. There\u2019s been a continued rise in the clustering of museums across the world, from the Broad Museum\u2019s opening near the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, to the rise of the West Bund Cultural Corridor in Shanghai. These districts have often absorbed the lesson of Lincoln Center and other flawed predecessors, taking care that museum districts don\u2019t just contain museums, but a variety of other urban uses. Some hermits persist, but that occasionally unsociable creature of the museum is lately seeking out the one thing it\u2019s spurned in the past: company.

Li, a director of international project marketing for the US real estate giant CBRE, is predicting a surge of eastern investment in British homes over the next decade, as increasingly affluent Chinese investors acquire a taste for international property.  \u201cI think it is just beginning,\u201d says Li, of the amount of money pouring into property around the world from mainland China. \u201cYou do the figures: China has a population of 1.4 billion. If you target only 1% of China\u2019s population, that\u2019s 14 million people \u2013 so it\u2019s already almost two Londons.\u201d Sitting in his office overlooking Hong Kong\u2019s skyscraper-dotted Victoria Harbour, Li estimates that just 3% of potential Chinese investors in overseas property have so far been found \u2013 meaning a virtually untapped goldmine lies over the border in mainland China. \u201cChina is a big market, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cThey are getting wealthier and wealthier.\u201d     Victor Li in his Hong Kong office    Rich Hong Kong investors have been ploughing money into British bricks and mortar for decades, snapping up off-plan apartments at weekly property fairs that can then be rented, flipped, held as investments or used as second homes. \u201cI have one [London property] in Canary Wharf, one in City Island, one in Wembley Park, one in Elephant and Castle,\u201d said one investor matter-of-factly at a recent expo in Hong Kong\u2019s chic Mandarin Oriental Hotel, as he eyed a new development near the Thames Barrier in E16. But many real-estate agents and property experts in east Asia believe a new wave of investment is just getting under way, as mainland investors develop a taste for international real estate, including postcodes up and down the UK. \u201cOur thesis \u2013 and this is supported by quite a lot of evidence \u2013 is that in many ways the international Chinese investment journey is probably just starting,\u201d says Charles Pittar, chief executive of Juwai.com, a website that aims to pair mainland buyers with property developers in places such as Australia, the US and the UK. Pittar\u2019s company, which lists 2.5 million properties and calls itself China\u2019s largest international real-estate website, estimates that in 2014, Chinese outbound investment into residential and commercial property was more than $50bn (\u00a338bn).  \u201cI guess the key is: what is it going to become?\u201d Pittar says. \u201cOur view is that \u2026 it could be growing to somewhere around $200bn [annually] over the next 10 years.\u201d And Britain, despite its decision to leave the EU, is expected to be one of the key focuses, he adds. \u201cThe UK market, particularly post-Brexit, is really picking up.\u201d Pittar traces mainland China\u2019s hunger for overseas property back to the turn of the century, just before China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organisation signalled the latest phase of its integration into the global economy. But the outflow of money has gathered pace over the past decade, and is set to grow further as middle-class investors from second- and third-tier cities get in on the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a big market now, but it is likely to be anywhere from two to four times the size in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d Pittar says. \u201cThe exciting thing about China is that there are 168 cities with more than a million people. So this is just such a huge market.\u201d     A poster for the new Royal Wharf development in London from a recent property show in Hong Kong. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Li, who specialises in London properties worth up to \u00a34m, concurs with the notion that Brexit is helping to accelerate the boom in interest in the UK: \u201cSome of my clients at the beginning of the year, they said: \u2018OK Victor, let\u2019s wait, wait, wait.\u2019 And then, after they found out about Brexit and [the] sterling came down more than 10%, I got more calls \u2013 they want to go back into the market. It\u2019s lots of saving,\u201d he says with a grin. According to Pittar, Chinese who buy property overseas have four main motivations: investment, lifestyle, emigration and education. Many are looking for a foothold in the UK, where they hope their children will go on to study.\u201cSome people are buying for their family to use it,\u201d says Li, \u201csome are buying to diversify, some are buying because they want to own a property for investment \u2013 and some people are buying for prestige, to say: \u2018I own a piece of property in London.\u2019\u201d Crucially, he says, London is also seen as a secure place to store money that investors want to move out of China, to guard against the devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan. \u201cPeople in mainland China, they want to get their money out ... They believe that money out of China is safe money. And London is a safe-haven to park that money.\u201d The 50-year-old property salesman made his first foray into mainland China in 2001, pitching a slice of Lambeth\u2019s St George Wharf to would-be investors at a five-star hotel on Shanghai\u2019s answer to Oxford Street.

London is a safe-haven  Victor Li     Over the past year alone, Li has made almost 20 such trips, jetting out from his base in Hong Kong to cities including Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu to meet with cash-flush Chinese buyers. \u201cThis one is Macau \u2026 This one is Shanghai,\u201d he says, flicking through photographs on his smartphone of recent seminars where he advertised luxury London developments such as Clipper Wharf in E1 and Carrara Tower on City Road. Li says some mainland investors agree to buy apartments on the spot. \u201cIf they are interested, they reserve the unit \u2013 they just use a credit card. They have Union Pay, Mastercard or Visa: \u00a35,000.\u201d Many of his mainland investors are real-estate tycoons who have made a fortune from their country\u2019s economic boom, and now \u201cjust want to take the profits, cash out and move some of their wealth overseas\u201d.  But Pittar believes the story of ordinary, middle-class investors is more significant than that of China\u2019s globe-trotting, Ferrari-driving elite. \u201cWhat we read in the newspapers is always about the very wealthy Chinese who come and buy a \u00a35m, \u00a310m, \u00a315m property. But the middle class is key. How big is the middle class? It could be 120 million. We tend to think it\u2019s probably closer to 150 million. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve got somewhere to live in China, the reality is that the domestic market is quite expensive, so that\u2019s why they are looking more for international opportunities. Like anyone who wants to preserve their wealth, diversification is important.\u201d     London\u2019s Nine Elms redevelopment: property in the UK capital is seen as both prestigious and secure in China. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris for the Guardian    Predictions that a new wave of investment from mainland China is on the horizon will stir further debate over the measures British politicians might use to protect local home buyers. The anticipated influx of money from mainland China into the UK is set to affect not only London \u2013 historically the focus for much east Asian investment \u2013 but cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, to which more of the investment is now heading. \u201cThose seem to be the hotspots,\u201d says Neil Jensen, the Hong Kong-based regional director for London estate agent Fraser &amp; Co, who promotes developments in the capital to Asian investors.  A particular spotlight has been shining on Manchester since last October, when Chinese president Xi Jinping toured the city to lend his support to George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project during his first state visit to Britain.  Jensen says Fraser &amp; Co, founded in 1995, has traditionally specialised in London properties which it markets internationally through offices in Dubai and Hong Kong. Now, however, he is preparing to offer his clients their first major investment opportunity outside the capital, in a project specifically designed to attract Chinese money. Called \u201cNew Chinatown\u201d \u2013 or Xinhua Bu (New China Wharf) in Mandarin \u2013 the \u00a3200m venture in Liverpool describes itself as \u201cone of the most important and exciting developments in the UK today\u201d and promises to be \u201cone of the UK\u2019s most luxurious and desirable residential destinations\u201d.    You can\u2019t just put up a block of flats in Liverpool and expect people to buy it \u2013 there has to be a story  Neil Jensen     The development\u2019s website boasts: \u201cIt is the burgeoning energy and dynamism of modern China transplanted into the heart of an historic World Heritage City.\u201d Adding: \u201cThis is an historic moment \u2026 This is a unique investment opportunity. \u201cUnderpinning the whole masterplan is the idea and motif of the awakening dragon \u2013 a powerful symbol of China\u2019s resurgence and status as a new global power.\u201d Jensen says improving transport infrastructure in the northwest and relatively low prices meant New Chinatown \u2013 where two-bedroom duplex penthouses are on offer for up to \u00a3546,427 and ordinary one-bedroom flats from \u00a3119,211 \u2013 would be a hit with Chinese investors.  \u201cYou can\u2019t just put up a block of flats in Liverpool and expect people to buy it \u2026 If you want foreign buyers there has to be a story,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cThey\u2019ll probably go quite quickly.\u201d The fringes of London have also come onto the radar of Chinese investors, thanks to Crossrail, a \u00a314.8bn, 73-mile metrolink cutting west to east across the capital, which is set to open in 2018. \u201cMost of your investors 20 or 30 years ago would have been going more towards the bullseye in dartboard terms,\u201d Jensen says, referring to the centre of London. But improved transport links are now drawing foreign investors to places such as Slough, Ilford and Canning Town. \u201cThe commuter area \u2013 anything within a 20-30 minute travel time [of central London] is hot,\u201d says Jonathan Gordon, a director at IP Global, a Hong Kong property investment firm that is promoting projects in Ilford and Croydon and has previously invested in Slough.     Mercury House, a new development in Slough being marketed in Hong Kong. Illustration: Fraser &amp; Co    \u201cSlough has got Crossrail going through it so you can get to Bond Street in no time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is those sorts of stories we are interested in as opposed to buying in Bond Street itself.\u201d Crossrail is not the only reason foreign investors are now looking to the outskirts of the capital, though. Investors and industry insiders say stamp duty increases targeting wealthy foreign investors have pushed up the cost of buying more expensive properties in prime locations. That has led many foreign investors to buy a larger number of cheaper properties in more peripheral, suburban areas, says Gordon, where \u201ctransaction costs are lower.\u201d One veteran Hong Kong investor, with a portfolio that includes properties in London, Manchester and Liverpool, explains: \u201cYou buy a large number of properties, but lower-priced ones \u2026 You pay something like \u00a3200,000 or \u00a3250,000, rather than \u00a31m for zone one in Mayfair, places like that.\u201d This new wave of Chinese investors includes people such as Jody Ye, a 30-year-old from Chongqing, a metropolis in south-west China. In July, Ye paid \u00a3200,000 for a flat in Bristol, where she went to university and now lives. She is planning to buy her second UK property. \u201cBuying property back home is too expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cInvesting in the UK is much more cost-efficient.\u201d Bristol is not only \u201ca great place\u201d, but, she adds: \u201cBritish people think Bristol is posh.\u201d      The Hong Kong headquarters of Juwai.com    Fan Feifei, 34, from Xi\u2019an, is another Chinese buy-to-let investor. She is preparing to purchase her third property in Birmingham. \u201cI bought it purely for investment,\u201d she says of her second purchase, a \u00a3135,000 home in B29, which she rents to overseas students. \u201cSince 2014, Chinese people have been rushing to buy houses in the UK,\u201d adds Fan, pointing to high rental yields and stable property prices as key driving factors. \u201cAll of the Chinese people around me are buying houses or have already bought several houses in the UK. I\u2019m the one who has bought the least, with only two.\u201d Song Dongzhe, a third mainland investor, from the north-eastern city of Dalian, bought his first British property \u2013 a three-bedroomed house in Selly Oak, south-west Birmingham \u2013 in 2012 for \u00a3125,000. Earlier this year he bought two more. Song says the UK is \u201cvery attractive to Chinese property investors\u201d, largely because it does not have the high duties that have been introduced in Canada and Australia targeting foreign buyers. High prices in London make it \u201ctoo risky\u201d to buy there, he adds. But \u201cas the UK\u2019s second biggest city, I thought Birmingham was a choice that made sense\u201d. A fourth mainland investor, who declines to be named, says President Xi\u2019s tour of the UK convinced him Britain was the right place to invest his family\u2019s fortune. Property in major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen is now too expensive, the Shanghai investor says, and China\u2019s stock market is \u201cextremely unstable \u2013 so I think it\u2019s a good time to invest in [the] UK.\u201d As well as London, he says he is now looking at opportunities in cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh. Underlying discontent Speaking in his Hong Kong office, property promoter Gordon predicts that, as has happened elsewhere in the world, concern over foreign investment in British property will eventually lead to the introduction of measures to protect local buyers. \u201cThere is that underlying discontent in some camps to say: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not on, it\u2019s not fair \u2013 releasing and selling all this property overseas.\u2019  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, going forward, there is some legislation that says a certain percentage of properties have to be sold or marketed locally for a period of time, and then it is fair game overseas [after that].\u201d Australia, currently the second biggest destination for Chinese property investment after the United States, has been cracking down on foreign buyers since last year, after complaints that China\u2019s voracious appetite for property in cities such as Sydney and Melbourne was pricing local buyers out of the market. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous city that returned to Chinese control in 1997, has also been fighting to quell a huge wave of often speculative mainland investment in residential property. In a bid to rein in sky-high prices, authorities in the former colony have rolled out a series of cooling measures in recent years, including tighter lending rules and higher stamp duties.      Hong Kong has been battling a huge wave of investment from mainland China in its residential property. Photograph: Marco Wong/Getty Images    Victoria Allan, an Australian real estate entrepreneur who specialises in leasing and selling property on Hong Kong island, says: \u201cThe price point has moved so high in Hong Kong that it\u2019s hard to buy a house any more for under US$10m that, five or six years ago, you could buy for $5m.\u201d Allan, founder of Habitat Property, says efforts to stem the flow of mainland money into Hong Kong have diverted a significant amount of Chinese investment elsewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s moved into Australia and the UK; it\u2019s moved into the US. And it has really pushed those markets up as well.\u201d Allan believes that the Hong Kong government pushed back too hard against the influx of mainland money, and advises British policymakers to avoid taking too drastic steps. \u201cI would definitely say: don\u2019t shut it out totally. That was our mistake. I think Hong Kong has approached it too harshly. Why shut the door totally?\u201d By locking mainland Chinese real estate investors out, Allan argues, \u201cthe whole economy suffers, not just the property market. There has to be some kind of balance. We are supposed to be an international city.  \u201cMaybe some tax is applicable,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think there is a way to manage it in a really positive way for everyone. Particularly if that is done in conjunction with town planning and helping direct the investment into towns and city centres that need assistance with good housing. There are great ways to take the investment.\u201d     Buying property back home is too expensive. Investing in the UK is much more cost-efficient  Jody Ye     Jensen also warns against demonising foreign investors, who he says play an essential role in helping developers build new homes. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a world city and not have foreign investment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of schemes going up, but how on earth are they going to fund them?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe banks don\u2019t have the money \u2026 So you\u2019ve got to rely on overseas investment, be it funding by way of people buying them, or by someone saying, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll buy the site and the development and we\u2019ll sell it back to the Brits\u2019.\u201d Li says he recognises the controversy surrounding foreign investment, but shrugs it off as a natural phenomenon: \u201cI think even in Hong Kong we face the same problem. You just can\u2019t avoid it; it\u2019s supply and demand. Everybody wants to live in the best location, right?\u201d But not everyone is convinced Chinese investment in overseas property will continue to soar. Gordon says the scale of future investment will depend on the health of the Chinese economy, and the enthusiasm with which Beijing enforces capital controls limiting how much money individuals can remove from the country. Others believe the uncertainty caused by Brexit will put the brakes on further moves into the UK.  Concerns over the risk involved in some UK developments may also curb enthusiasm for off-plan investment. For months, rumours have been swirling in Hong Kong about major developments that appear to have collapsed after the developer went bust, leaving investors struggling to recoup their money.   Related: Gentrification is a global problem.

That city is Vancouver, and in response to these mounting challenges, the west-coast Canadian metropolis recently imposed an extraordinary new tax on foreign buyers \u2013 whose impact is now being watched closely by other cities grappling with bloated property markets. On 2 August, Vancouver introduced a tax on anyone from outside Canada wanting to buy a home in its super-heated market. In future, city authorities said, if you weren\u2019t Canadian, you would have to pay an extra 15% on the purchase price. The impact has, by some measures, been more startling than campaigners could have hoped for. The price of the average detached home reportedly slumped by an astonishing 16.7% in August alone to C$1.47m (\u00a3856,000), according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Some agents are reporting that the market has gone from red hot to stone cold in a matter of weeks. British Columbia\u2019s premier, Christy Clark, who introduced the tax, told reporters there will be no going back on it. \u201cThe prices were going up way too fast and if we helped slow that down, that\u2019s good,\u201d she said. In the year before the tax, prices in the city were galloping ahead at a rate of 39% a year amid widespread concern that investors, from China in particular, were pricing out local residents.     Vancouver authorities have taken extraordinary action to curb its super-heated housing market. Photograph: Alamy    It is a concern echoed in cities across the Pacific Rim. In June, Sydney introduced a 4% stamp duty surcharge on foreigners buying homes; the following month, Melbourne hiked stamp duty rates from 3% to 7% for foreign buyers \u2013 in both cases to deter rampant property speculation. Queensland, whose capital is Brisbane, has followed suit with an extra 3% duty surcharge that will be slapped on \u201cforeign persons\u201d buying residential property and land from 1 October. In Auckland, New Zealand \u2013 currently the world\u2019s frothiest property market \u2013 property investors are, as of last month, required to put down at least 40% of the purchase price in cash.   Related: 'This is just the start': China's passion for foreign property    Global property agents Knight Frank say there has been a big increase in cities and countries \u2013 from Switzerland to Fiji \u2013 imposing measures to deter foreign buyers in recent years. However China, traditionally one of the countries most resistant to such investment, eased its rules in 2015, with individual cities now determining the limits on qualifying foreign individuals and companies (in Shanghai, for example, the restriction is one property). How long-lasting the impact of Vancouver\u2019s tax will prove is a subject of much debate. Greater Vancouver\u2019s Real Estate Board prefers to use measures that suggest the city\u2019s market has only dipped mildly. And earlier this month Jing Li, a 29-year-old Chinese student living in the adjoining city of Burnaby, began a class-action lawsuit against the new tax. Li had put a 10% deposit down on a half-million dollar Vancouver townhouse in July, only for the tax to be imposed 12 days later. According to CBC News, this added C$84,000 to the price of Li\u2019s house, meaning she was suddenly at risk of losing her C$56,000 deposit. \u201cI can\u2019t go forward and I can\u2019t go back,\u201d she told CBC.  \u2018The only solution\u2019 Ron Jordens, a 72-year-old retired engineer, lives in a rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant: once a gritty working-class Vancouver neighbourhood, now hipster central. The block\u2019s landlords have served an eviction notice. According to Jordens, they are hoping to cash in on the boom by renovating the flats \u2013 and raising rents by 50%. He says the \u201crenovation\u201d is unnecessary, claiming it is simply a device to circumvent rules protecting tenants. But amid spiralling rents elsewhere in the city, he says some of his neighbours have had no choice but to accept the landlords\u2019 demands. One single mother with an 11-year-old child was temporarily evicted, he says, and has had to take on three jobs to afford the new rent. \u201cPeople who have a good, decent-paying job can\u2019t afford to buy in Vancouver, and they can barely afford to rent,\u201d Jordens says.     Ron Jordens is facing eviction from his rent-controlled apartment block in Mount Pleasant. Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/Metro    The new tax, he adds, is just \u201cputting a Band-Aid\u201d on the problem, predicting that \u201cthere will be ways around it with side-contracts. It has got to the point where the only solution has to be a \u2018no foreign ownership\u2019 deal on the table.\u201d But isn\u2019t Canada a country built on immigration? Jordens points to the thousands of unoccupied flats across the city, built for investors who often never reside there. \u201cIf you are coming to live here, get a job and pay taxes, that\u2019s great. The trouble is they don\u2019t live here, and they don\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d There are an estimated 10,000-plus empty apartments in Vancouver, of which a significant number are owned by foreign investors. In mid-September, 200 protestors from a new campaign group, HALT \u2013 Housing Action for Local Taxpayers \u2013 took to Vancouver\u2019s streets demanding action to control the market. Among the speakers were academics who argue that the Canadian home-owning dream is being crushed because they can\u2019t compete with foreign investors.   Vancouver tops UBS's Global Real Estate Bubble Index   The protests appear to be working: an empty homes tax last week won the approval of city councillors and is set to be implemented next year. Even owners of empty Airbnb flats could be fined $10,000 for failing to comply. Vancouver is fast turning into a test-bed of initiatives to cool outrageous property prices and rents. But over on West Vancouver\u2019s Marine Drive, home to plush waterfront estates (one sold for $50m last year), the city\u2019s biggest realtor to Chinese investors, Clarence Debelle, says the new taxes are \u201cdriven by jealousy and envy\u201d. He says the Vancouver market was slowing in any case, and that the 15% tax on overseas buyers will do nothing to help priced-out 25- to 35-year-olds buying entry-level apartments. But it could, he warns, destroy the local economy.  \u201cVirtually everything being built in West Vancouver is being built for a Chinese buyer. Vancouver has no industry apart from tourism and construction. So what do we do? Decide to insult the Chinese. You may not just blight the property market, but bankrupt the construction industry, too.\u201d  Debelle predicts stalemate in Vancouver\u2019s market as sellers refuse to drop prices. And he fears for Canada\u2019s global reputation: \u201cIn my view, the Chinese see this as a racist-motivated tax. It\u2019s a dark moment in Canadian political history. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong tax too,\u201d he adds, \u201cas it won\u2019t help the people at the bottom wanting to get into the market. It has not changed the pricing of their homes one bit. There are better ways to help, such as increasing supply.\u201d Debelle\u2019s own father emigrated from Europe after the second world war. \u201cVancouver is now an international destination. You can\u2019t have it both ways: benefit from trade and tourism, and have the tax.\u201d  \u2018The market has been distorted\u2019 Vancouver\u2019s experiment is being closely watched in London. According to London Assembly member Sian Berry, who stood as the Green party\u2019s candidate for mayor: \u201cVancouver shows that the very rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is not just a London problem \u2013 it\u2019s a growing problem all over the world.     Vancouver shows that the rich buying up luxury flats at the expense of ordinary people is a growing problem worldwide  Sian Berry     \u201cLondon needs more devolution so we can take similar steps,\u201d Berry says, \u201ccontrolling stamp duty and council tax, and closing the loopholes that allow people to buy property through offshore companies \u2013 so that the people who actually live in London can stand a chance.  \u201cA huge amount of housing in London is being bought up by offshore companies to avoid paying tax,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn my area in north London, overseas companies bought up \u00a32.5bn of property in just four years and avoided hundreds of millions in stamp duty.\u201d Berry\u2019s concerns are shared not only by the left. The Bow Group, a conservative thinktank, issued a paper last year in which it talked of a global super-rich elite, some of them criminal, snapping up property in London, pushing up costs for existing residents and throwing the poor to the edges of the city.  The report\u2019s author, Daniel Valentine, traces the phenomenal increase in London house prices to the mid 1990s, when three factors came together: a sudden surge in population, the explosion in buy-to-let lending, and the entry of China and Russia into the global economy, producing a global elite seeking a safe home for their cash. These factors have, he says, corrupted the market, creating an insatiable \u201cinvestment demand\u201d divorced from the underlying needs of British society.     Prospective buyers wait to inspect a house for sale in Sydney\u2019s Eastwood suburb. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    On the other side of the Pacific to Vancouver, the same arguments are rehearsed in Australia and New Zealand, although not just about the global elite. One recent report followed a day of family home auctions in Sydney\u2019s northern suburbs; all but one property were said to have been bought by Chinese buyers, with even modest homes fetching A$1.8m (\u00a31.05m).  Two decades ago, buying a house in a major Australian city cost around five times the income of the average young Australian. Now, after the country\u2019s economic boom, it is about 15 times. Pete Wargent is a leading property buying agent in Sydney and Brisbane. \u201cThe phenomenon of the Chinese buyer has been a huge story here for years now. But you just have to look where Australia is; there are a lot of pathways for Chinese money.\u201d He says the flood of Chinese cash has sparked an extraordinary building boom. \u201cThere are more high-rise apartments under construction than ever \u2013 with 150,000 going up across the country.\u201d  Given that Australia bans foreign buyers of existing homes, nearly all the Chinese money is pouring into new-build towers. The 4% stamp duty surcharge means a non-resident buyer pays about A$30,000 more than an Australian resident for a A$750,000 apartment in Sydney.   Related: Gentrification is a global problem. It's time we found a better solution    It\u2019s difficult to assess the impact of the surcharge yet, says Wargent, although he notes a gathering panic in some Australian banks, which are now far less keen to lend to non-residents. From 2017 a second new surcharge will hit non-residents: a 0.75% land tax, which has to be paid each year. Some fear that apartments bought off-plan will be dumped back on the market en masse. Will that help to moderate prices for local buyers? \u201cEventually it could help,\u201d says Wargent. \u201cThe problem in Sydney and Melbourne is that the market has been heavily distorted in favour of investors. In Sydney more than half the market is investors, which is a crazy imbalance.\u201d. Critics say that a flood of apartment purchases through domestic pension \u201csuper-funds\u201d is more to blame for the spiralling prices than Chinese buyers. Wargent also throws into the mix \u201clandbanking\u201d by major developers \u2013 drip-feeding sites into the market to ensure prices keep soaring \u2013 plus loose lending criteria from the major banks. \u201cIn truth, it has been tough for first-time buyers for nearly a generation now,\u201d he says. He advocates a broad-based land value tax (LVT) as about the only measure \u201cto cool the sheer demand for housing here\u201d. The bad news for young Australians wanting a foothold on the fabled property ladder is that the latest house price figures are just out. Despite the new stamp duty on foreign buyers and a slowdown earlier in the year, prices in every major Australian city, except Perth and Darwin, have picked up again.

Flooding causes more economic, social and humanitarian damage than any other natural disaster and has affected 2.3 billion people over the past 20 years, according to research from the Global Resilience Partnership. China has been particularly affected. This year saw the worst floods in the country since 1998. In July 150 people were killed in central and northern China after intense rainfall.  \u201cIn China the climate is bringing more rain in summer. From June to September there will be high density rainfall which is bringing up urban planning problems,\u201d says Michael Zhao, an associate and expert in water management in the Shanghai office of global urban designers Arup. \u201cThere\u2019s already been very serious flooding for four or five years each summer. You will see flooding in more and more cities. As urbanisation brings more people to those cities the problem becomes worse and worse.\u201d   Related: How tweeting about floods became a civic duty in Jakarta    An unprecedented scale In December 2013 President Xi Jiping announced a national plan to combat flooding in China\u2019s cities\u2013 inhabited by 450 million people. \u201cHe said that during the upgrade of urban drainage infrastructure they should make it a priority to retain valuable water resources and to utilise the natural system to achieve drainage, to establish natural retention, natural infiltration and natural purification \u2013 like a sponge city,\u201d says Zhao.  Initially 16 cities were selected as pilots for China\u2019s \u201csponge cities\u201d programme, but eventually it will be rolled out nationally. Designers will concede to the wisdom of nature to ensure water is absorbed when there\u2019s an excess: instead of water-resistant concrete, permeable materials and green spaces will be used to soak up rainfall, and rivers and streams will be interconnected so that water can flow away from flooded areas.  The ambitious project is being funded by central government (15-20%), local government and the private sector. The central government is giving each city 400m yuan (\u00a346m) a year for the first three years. In return, 20% of the chosen cities must be constructed to a sponge city standard by 2020, and 80% by 2030. All of the pilot cities need to have completed the pilot area construction by 2017.    One of the biggest takeaways for urban planners ... [is how to] integrate a climate resilient system into urban planning  WenMei Ha     The sponge city programme takes inspiration from low impact development in the US, water sensitive urban design in Australia and sustainable drainage systems in the UK.  But nothing at this scale has ever been attempted before. \u201cThe sponge city programme is more comprehensive and ambitious,\u201d says WenMei Ha, head of the China water management team at Arcadis, an international urban consultancy which was appointed to this plan by the government.  Arcadis is working on a sponge city project in Wuhan, a city of 10 million people in Hubei province in central China. The city is in dire need of efforts to counter the risk of flooding \u2013 in July, metro stations, roads and the football stadium were all under water.  \u201cGenerally, this programme involves water governance, financing structures and technical measures,\u201d Ha says. \u201cWith regard to the technical aspects, an integrated urban water system would be built, which incorporates low impact development measures, upgrades the traditional urban drainage system and provides solutions for excessive run-off discharge. These three measures together make up a sponge city storm-water system.\u201d     While China\u2019s investors are reportedly not interested in the sponge cities programme, persistent flooding will have far-reaching consequences for the country\u2019s residents and economy. Photograph: VCG/Getty Images    The sponge cities programme isn\u2019t just designed to tackle flooding but also to offer a solution to water shortages. China has much less freshwater per capita than most countries, many sources of what are polluted. Arup is working on a sponge city masterplan in Baotou in inner Mongolia. \u201cWater shortage is seriously heightened there,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cUrbanisation is quite limited by the shortage of water.\u201d The plan looks at how to retain rainwater and keep it inside the catchment. Although flooding is not a problem in Baotou now, urbanisation is happening rapidly and \u201cwe can foresee [that] if it continues in the conventional way, urban flooding will heighten in the next five years,\u201d he adds.  Measuring progress It\u2019s two years since the sponge cities programme began but Ha says it\u2019s still too early to tell if it will be successful. The programme is facing great challenges due to \u201cthe ever increasing urban population,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the biggest take aways for urban planners and policymakers in other countries would be how to overcome those challenges and integrate a climate resilient system into urban planning.\u201d   Related: Flooding in China leaves more than 100 people dead or missing    Zhao agrees that the programme is \u201cvery challenging\u201d. He says, \u201cfrom our experience working with pilot cities governments and local design institutes, there are both technical and management issues, depending on how the local pilot cities manage those challenges; some cities move faster, some comparably slow.\u201d The technical challenges are making sure that the masterplans accurately consider the local hydrology and climate, Zhao adds.  And there are challenges around financing the project by public private partnership (PPP) investment, due to the need to identify the returns for all parties. \u201cBecause it is difficult to measure the service, it is difficult to set up a healthy financial model,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cThe rainwater treatment facilities owners [for example] don\u2019t normally benefit [financially].\u201d But he says that once a successful PPP agreement is decided upon, that can be used in other cities.  The Economist recently reported that investors are \u201cnot interested\u201d in the sponge city programme, indicating a slowdown of the Chinese economy in general. But if the majority of China\u2019s densely populated cities are submerged every summer, the economy and the residents will suffer even more.  Still, Zhao sees the sponge cities programme as \u201ca very positive change. Previously in the past 30 years people just followed conventional national standards \u2026 We are shifting to a sustainable way to manage water issues in cities.

But the relief of seeing a pair of headlights peek through the tunnel, or the sensation of the hot air of a passing train, are so mundane they can often go uncelebrated save for a fleeting moment.  Poetry like Meitner\u2019s can give us a space to sing the praises and frustrations of the cities we live in. But can it actually help us make those cities better? Can poetry be a way to experience and understand our environment more richly? Many people\u2019s first formal interaction with poetry \u2013 beyond nursery rhymes, at least \u2013 tends to be centred on the Romantic-era poets such as Blake, Keats, Wordsworth or Shelley. This particular tradition is known for being rooted in a celebration of the beauty of the natural world, typified in classics such as Keats\u2019 Ode to Autumn (\u201cWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day / And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue\u201d), and Shelley\u2019s Ode to the West Wind:   Thou who didst waken from his summer dreamsThe blue Mediterranean, where he layLull\u2019d by the coil of his crystalline streams\u201d   So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that over time, poetry has been less associated with train tracks, smog, and bridges and more with brooks, brambles, and fields.  However, east London-based poet Tom Chivers, whose work focuses heavily on the urban experience and who has made a series of poetic audio walks down London\u2019s lost rivers, says that emphasis is misplaced.     There is this energy and aggression and speed in a city that lends itself to poetry  Tom Chivers     \u201cThe city resists nostalgic forms of poetry that have been handed down to us in various traditions,\u201d Chivers says. \u201cThere is this energy and aggression and speed in a city that lends itself to poetry. We are surrounded by language, whether it\u2019s place names, digital signs, advertising hoardings or the voices of market traders \u2013 it\u2019s everywhere. Cities are built with language.\u201d     \u2018I see the F train\u2019s twin headlights blooming into the station.\u2019 (Erika Meitner) Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images    South London poet Inua Ellams focuses on poetry and the urban experience, specifically from an immigrant perspective (Ellams was born in Nigeria). He writes in his poem Directions:  You know the wild bushes at the back of the flat, the ones that scrape the kitchen window the ones that struggle for soil or water, and fail where the train tracks scar the ground?  He runs walking poetry workshops with the \u201cexperiential travel\u201d company SideStory, during which anyone can try turning their attention to the poetic undercurrent of the city. At the Southbank Centre\u2019s Poetry Library, which houses the most comprehensive collection of poetry in the UK, Ellams tells me that \u201cpoems are 3D portraits of the world using as few words as possible\u201d. A shortcut to creating that portrait, he says, is by focusing on the senses. This shift in focus from the cerebral to the physical feels particularly apt in the urban setting, where we are bombarded with all manner of sensory assaults \u2013 from unsavoury fumes to dewy morning light and the smell of croissants. Taken as a whole, this can be overwhelming; but embraced intentionally, with a kind of poetic mindfulness, these common threads of the urban experience can take on a whole new meaning.  One urban poetic tradition that revels in that act of noticing is that of the fl\u00e2neur, or the 19th-century wanderer, personified by the French poet Charles Baudelaire, who once wistfully wrote: \u201cThe form of a city changes faster, alas, than the human heart.\u201d In her book about the subversive tradition of female fl\u00e2neurs, Flaneuse, Lauren Elkin writes of the way Virginia Woolf practiced this art in her Bloomsbury neighbourhood:    The form of a city changes faster, alas, than the human heart  Charles Baudelaire     \u201cWoolf reminds us that there is something physically absorbing that keys us into the throb of the city, transformed by the quality of the light, of the air, of the road \u2026 The city, [Woolf] wrote in her diary in 1928, was forever \u2018attract[ing], stimulat[ing]\u2019 her, giving her \u2018a play and a story and a poem\u2019.\u201d     Hip-hop lyrics are a distinct kind of urban poetry. Photograph: Allstar/Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar    Ellams echoes this sentiment. \u201cSo much of the urban experience is going somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cMeandering is not celebrated.\u201d By slowing down, we notice the kinds of poetic details that can help us transcend the normal thrum of daily life.  The 18th-century poet Alexander Pope was a practitioner of a slightly more provocative kind of urban poetry \u2013 he gained notoriety for his habit of cussing and satirising his adversaries in verse. In his four-part poem The Dunciad, Pope publicly lampoons his literary and political rivals and name-drops the \u201cGrub Street race\u201d \u2013 the bohemian neighbourhood that is now Milton Street near the Barbican in London, where poets and hacks used to compete in public readings for literary prestige.  Live poetry readings in cities went on to become a key element of the legend of the Beat generation, particularly a famous reading in 1955 at the Six Gallery in San Francisco, where Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure and Gary Snyder (among others) came to the attention of Lawrence Ferlinghetti, whose offer to publish Ginsberg\u2019s Howl kicked off their fame. Today, modern-day Grub Streets and Beat-style events continue to pop up all over London, from open mics, spoken word nights and readings such as The Poetry Society\u2019s Poetry Unplugged. Indeed, Pope\u2019s disses are of a style that\u2019s similar to what we today might call a rap battle. Hip-hop lyrics are a distinctly urban kind of poetry that has exploded in the past 30 years, rising mainly from the experience of black Americans in cities but increasingly to be found in metropolises worldwide. Though the line between rap and poetry depends heavily on who you ask (linguist, literary critic, poet), and Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s declaration that TS Elliot invented rap is even more tin-eared than his music, it is not hard to see the same contemplative urban spirit in Eminem\u2019s film 8 Mile as in some of the best classic urban poetry.   Related: Female rappers take a stand in Mexico's capital of violence against women    Another successful project similarly proves that urban poetry needn\u2019t be intimidating or elitist, but simply accessible: Poems on the Underground, a public art project funded by the Arts Council and now celebrating its 30th year, has seen 600 poems grace the inside carriages of the Tube and been emulated from New York to Shanghai. \u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing to have created a public art project that is so widely liked,\u201d says Judith Chernaik, co-creator and curator.  \u201cThe tradition of poetry appearing in parks, in buildings \u2013 this has gone on a long time. There was nothing original about [our project] except that it was on the Tube,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, in such a commercialised world, I think there\u2019s a kind of implicit pleasure in the poems just being there, not doing anything to you, and not forcing you to do anything. People can read it or not. Nobody is shouting. It isn\u2019t a competition \u2013 just an offering.\u201d In a modern world where hyper-connectivity often results in disconnection from our immediate surroundings, creating the space to explore poetry can make us more reflective and engaged citizens. With poetry, the city becomes a place where we meander, both physically and mentally \u2013 or as Chernaik puts it, \u201cbe lifted up to another world, even when we\u2019re underground\u201d.

The ladder was the culmination of a childhood dream and more than 20 years of pyrotechnic ambition, having devised but failed to complete similar ladders in Bath, UK, in 1994; Shanghai in 2001; and in Los Angeles four years ago, when the attempt was shut down by authorities as a fire hazard. The New York-based artist claims in a new Netflix documentary about the making of Sky Ladder that \u201cthere is no success or failure in art\u201d. This final installment of the project was offered more in tenderness than abstraction or ceremonial grandeur.  Days after the project completed, Guo\u00ad-Qiang\u2019s 100-year-old grandmother \u2013 with whom he maintained a close relationship stemming, at least, from his earliest experimentation with his established artistic medium, gunpowder \u2013 passed away. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know when to set the fire, but also important to know when to put it out,\u201d she once wisely advised him.             \u201cThis project is one of those that I wanted to attempt since I was a young boy and wanted to touch the clouds,\u201d the softly spoken Guo\u00ad-Qiang told an audience in New York last night. \u201cI thought 500 meters could reach beyond the clouds to heaven.\u201d  The documentary attempts a deeper explanation of Guo-Qiang\u2019s work. Few other Chinese artists have been so overtly willing to take on Chinese government-sponsored projects: he was named director of visual and special effects of the Beijing Olympics in 2008; and later put on a display for world leaders at the Apac conference.  But while Sky Ladder was constructed and ignited without Chinese government approval, it was not intended as a political statement \u2013 avoiding official involvement was a matter of practicality rather than anything intrinsically political in the work itself.  \u201cHis art is not political,\u201d explained documentary producer Wendi Deng Murdoch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a political agenda. So he works with the Chinese officials, but he doesn\u2019t want his art to be political. He wants it to be enjoyable.\u201d  Rupert Murdoch\u2019s former wife, lately reported to be glamping with tech neo-hippies at Burning Man and holidaying with Ivanka Trump, has staged a high-profile, post-divorce comeback in the arena of arts and technology.  \u201cI love art, I love China,\u201d Murdoch says, \u201cand I love fireworks because they mean good luck.\u201d Her relationship with the artist dates back almost 20 years. \u201cCai and I became good friends when we lived as neighbors in SoHo. He\u2019s really mastered the technique of making art with fireworks and to use gunpowder to make art so I wanted to show the world how wonderful he is, and to help people understand China better on a cultural level.\u201d In the making of Sky Ladder, she explains, they avoided getting permits from the government not because Sky Ladder is itself political but because any large-scale project requires going through a frustrating bureaucratic process. The 400 or so islanders kept quiet about the preparations.  \u201cDuring the making of the film you can\u2019t always get what you want, but that\u2019s not just in China,\u201d says Murdoch. \u201cIn Paris, when we did One Night Stand, you also have to get permits. It\u2019s not so easy.\u201d  The documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, does a serviceable job of explaining Guo-Qiang\u2019s background as an artist \u2013 his father was a calligrapher and the family were forced to burn their books at the start of the cultural revolution \u2013 but there\u2019s a disconnect that mirrors a dilemma in Guo-Qiang\u2019s work, namely: is the beauty of his momentary, staged firework spectacles enough?  \u201cNo art is meant to be kept forever,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo I attempt to achieve a sense of eternal from the ephemeral.\u201d  Though Sky Ladder may be complete, the artists said his \u201cjourney of trying to dialog with the unseen world does not stop\u201d. \u201cSky Ladder is No 20 in my series, Projects for Extraterrestrials.

This tableau prompted in me a gentle realisation that the world was changing even more quickly than I\u2019d thought it was, and that I\u2019d better shake things up creatively to keep pace with it. I asked myself a few questions: how\u00a0can I imbue fiction with that same fractal sense of falling down a rabbit hole that we all experience when we\u2019re online? How can writing compete with Netflix? How could I compress emotion into as few words as possible \u2013 not just on a page but something people can read from a car at 50 miles per hour?   Related: Novelist Douglas Coupland: the man who sees into the future    To this end I deliberately upended what had been a 20-year-old writing routine. No more AM clock-based passivity, quietly awaiting words that may or may not come depending on the fussiness of my muse. No more predictability; instead of sitting there feeling nostalgic for my pre-internet brain, I tried to figure out what my new brain was becoming and how that affected my writing. So if you ask me what is my typical writing day, I have no specific answer, just a series of tendencies which together define my\u00a0new writing normal. One: I do much of my writing on planes. I\u2019m actually at my happiest when I\u2019m writing on a plane, and I\u2019m writing these words on a plane right now, Lufthansa flight 1436 from Frankfurt to St Petersburg. There\u2019s no Wi-Fi (sanctuary!) and I\u2019m having that not unpleasant sensation of soon-to-end Schengen-era statelessness \u2013 the kind of transnational fluidity so accurately touted by Monocle magazine \u2013 a headspace where all the men wear slim-fit clothing and all the women in little black dresses go back to the office from the Embassy function to do some late night C++ coding. Q: Would you like a glass of water with your vodka tonic?A: No. That\u2019s why God invented ice\u00a0cubes. Two: I do much of my writing in hotel rooms, especially if there\u2019s a deadline. Actually, since I wrote the above paragraph I\u2019ve landed and am now in the St Petersburg W hotel which has killer Wi-Fi and interior design choices possibly made (in the best possible sense) by an oligarch\u2019s mistress. There\u2019s something about being in a hotel room \u2013 most writers know this implicitly \u2013 that frees up one\u2019s thinking. First you place a scorched earth do-not-disturb on your\u00a0email account (autoreply: \u201cI\u2019m dead and hence unable to reply to your email\u201d) and second, hide the mobile phone in the desk drawer and \u2026 it\u2019s almost as good as being on a plane. Nobody can reach you. You\u2019re safe. Three: I write in places connected in definable ways to the forces of both globalisation and deglobalisation: Shanghai router-making facilities; Chilean classrooms taken over by protesting students, the rooms now converted into artists\u2019 studios; the International House of Pancakes on the\u00a0north side of Interstate 15 in Las Vegas.

What if I become too fragmented? What if the forces of the future I\u2019m trying to depict\u00a0crush me like a bug? But then, nothing ventured, nothing gained. The\u00a0world has never been so interesting as it is now. How sad not to\u00a0go out and bungee-jump into it from\u00a0a cosmic New Zealand cliff. A few years back, the New York Times did a series of photos of writers in their writing places. All of the other ones I saw were of desks in almost empty white rooms with linen sheers blowing in through the windows. The photo of me was of a small room painted black with all of the walls covered in shelving that was densely filled with hoarder-like amounts of design objects and art. I don\u2019t understand why writers would want an empty white room. It\u2019s like a metaphor for no life after life after death.

In Thien\u2019s China, the thing that should have arrived is always still to come, whether it involves a missing person, a secret message or a better future. The games start with the title of the novel which is, Thien explains, the English transliteration of a line from the anthem of the Communist party of China, which was translated via Russian from the French socialist anthem \u201cThe Internationale\u201d. Thien is on her way to speak at the Edinburgh International book festival when we meet. The novel is just out and she is feeling \u201cbefuddled and amazed\u201d by her appearance on the Man Booker list. Though virtually unknown in the UK, the 42-year-old writer has won awards in her native Canada for a small but scorching oeuvre dealing with some of the toughest history of the modern age. Before this latest novel \u2013 described by Guardian reviewer Isabel Hilton as \u201ca moving and extraordinary evocation of the 20th-century tragedy of China\u201d \u2013 came Dogs at the Perimeter, which dealt with another great tragedy, the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s. Do Not Say We Have Nothing opens in 1990 in the home of Marie, who disarmingly informs us that her Chinese nickname means \u201ccharming mineral\u201d. It was given to her by Ai-Ming, the daughter of mysteriously connected friends of her father, who has been adopted by her mother after fleeing the repercussions of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Ai-Ming\u2019s arrival in Canada opens the door on 60 years of catastrophic history involving the families of two talented Chinese musicians, one of whom \u2013 Marie\u2019s father \u2013 defected to the west, while the other stayed in China. Both men are now dead, leaving their daughters to piece together their story. Like Marie, Thien is a child of several cultures who grew up in Canada. Her mother was a Cantonese speaker from Hong Kong while her father is Hakka, ethnically Chinese but born in a part of Malaysia that was once the British protectorate of north Borneo. Her parents met as students in Australia then settled in Malaysia until the region became dangerously unstable. They emigrated to Vancouver in 1974 with two small children and a plan to open a Chinese-Canadian diner, \u201cwhich would serve chop suey plus bacon and egg sandwiches\u201d. Thien was born two months later and the diner failed, which, she says, was just as well as she was diagnosed with a life-threatening kidney condition which kept her in hospital for six months, with her parents keeping vigil at her bedside. After that, \u201cit was a very typical immigrant story in the sense that they struggled for a long time and my mum had three jobs. I remember not seeing her. My dad was the one who was at home with us, but we did, as kids, spend a lot of time alone,\u201d she says. As the sole member of her family who was born in the west, Thien is the only one whose mother tongue is English. She has no Mandarin, but learned Cantonese as a child, and has \u201cthe writing age of an eight-year-old\u201d. As for speaking: \u201cMy mother used to say that my tones are all crooked: it\u2019s like hearing a song sung out of tune.\u201d The perspective of a child who is both insider and outsider is central to Do Not Say We Have Nothing. It makes Marie into a historical sleuth whose observations drill down through layer after layer of difference. In an early scene, she watches her mother using a dictionary to decipher a letter announcing Ai-Ming\u2019s imminent arrival, then responding by telephone, \u201c[speaking] in her mother tongue, Cantonese, with brief interjections of Mandarin\u201d. The reason Marie\u2019s trilingual mother has to read with a dictionary is because she is not fluent in the simplified Chinese script imposed by Mao.   Related: The Man Booker prize 2016 shortlist \u2013 a judge\u2019s view    The novel takes us back from the \u201c1989 generation\u201d who were caught up in Tiananmen Square to the \u201c1966 generation\u201d, who went through the Cultural Revolution. It turns out that Marie\u2019s father, Jiang Kai, was a concert pianist who was tutored at the Shanghai Conservatory by Ai-Ming\u2019s father, Sparrow, a talented composer. The closure of the conservatory in 1966 drove the two musicians into different versions of artistic exile. While Jiang Kai flees first to Beijing and later to Canada, Sparrow is thrown into a no-man\u2019s land of creative silence. One of the more bizarre facts of the Cultural Revolution was that while western music was being destroyed all over China, Mao had a symphony orchestra in Beijing. Thien builds this paradox into the fabric of the novel: it is structured as theme and variations, taking its cue from Sparrow\u2019s obsession with Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations, as performed over several decades by the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. Thien was an idealistic 14-year-old Vancouver schoolgirl when the 1989 demonstrations began. \u201cIt was the first time I saw events outside unfolding in real time on CNN, and it was a parallel world. For a long time it looked as if it was going to turn out very differently: there was so much joy, as if people were finally going to have a say in what Chinese modernity would look like and in directing their country. Instead, a more authoritarian system became entrenched, and that\u2019s very shocking 27 years on.\u201d In the novel, Marie is too young to understand what is happening, but her incomprehension about her family\u2019s plight attaches itself to \u201cthose chaotic, frightening images of people and tanks, and my mother in front of the screen\u201d. Brusque but loving mothers recur through the novel. Thien\u2019s own was the eldest of 12 children. \u201cMy parents are quite reserved in English but funny and boisterous in their mother tongues,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of my best memories are of my mum sitting with her sisters and laughing and talking all night: that light emanating from her.\u201d As a solitary child, whose siblings \u201cwere older and didn\u2019t necessarily want to talk to me\u201d, she spent long hours on her own, walking to and from school through \u201cquite rough neighbourhoods\u201d, clutching \u201cthese magical things, books, that made an imaginative space other people could inhabit\u201d. She was a talented dancer, winning a scholarship to study contemporary dance and ballet at university, which she lost after becoming distracted by words. \u201cI came from quite a poor neighbourhood and didn\u2019t have access to ideas, so I did this silly thing. I was taking all these fourth year philosophy courses and it was a leap too great.\u201d Unable to support herself without the scholarship, she abandoned the course, and it was a while before she found a way of financing herself on the new journey of a literature degree. She emerged, aged 23, with \u201ca few short stories\u201d and took a clerical job at an academic press \u2013 \u201cthe perfect set of circumstances because the job was just the job and I could keep all that creative energy for trying to learn the art of short fiction\u201d. Then came the offer of a scholarship to do a master\u2019s degree in creative writing, \u201cand that was life changing\u201d. Thrift was one of the habits she is grateful to have learned from her mother: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gone into debt. Having enough money is important to me.\u201d She spent the first year working on the seven stories that would become her first book, Simple Recipes, devising a writing system that involved repeatedly abandoning and rewriting whole drafts. But a system that worked for a short stories caused problems when she set about her debut novel. \u201cThe trouble with that process of throwing it all out is that you lose some of the propulsion of the first draft. I was always retreating and losing the \u2018underdrawing\u2019.\u201d Her debut novel, Certainty, published in 2006, won two prizes in Canada but left her feeling dissatisfied. She had tried to tell the story of her father\u2019s Malaysian background, and says now, \u201cI felt I knew more than I did. It\u2019s a daughter\u2019s book: one I almost had to write so I could move on.\u201d The place she moved on to was Pol Pot\u2019s Cambodia, and a period of history from which few had emerged alive to tell the tale. Research for Dogs at the Perimeter involved travelling around the country for months. To her knowledge only the third novel ever to tackle the genocide of \u201cYear Zero\u201d, it carried a heavy burden of historical conscience, posing a question that has become central to her literary project: \u201cIf a person erases him or herself in order to survive, how can they find that self again? Can survival bring them peace, or is it only madness to remember?\u201d Do Not Say We Have Nothing makes the surprising suggestion that part of the solution might lie in the act of copying. The different generations of Marie and Ai-Ming\u2019s families are connected by the manuscript of a novel, \u201cThe Book of Records\u201d, chapters of which have been carefully copied out, hidden in walls and beneath floorboards, and passed from hand to hand. \u201cThe Book of Records\u201d is precious because it represents a narrative that doesn\u2019t conform to the approved version of Chinese history, Thien explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a book with no beginning, no middle and no end, in which the characters are seeing an alternative China where they recognise mirrors of themselves and which they write themselves into.\u201d She is speaking literally as well as metaphorically. \u201cThe act of copying is different in China because part of the art of calligraphy is that you learn to write as the masters did. It\u2019s a lot about breath and pressure and line. You\u2019re almost learning to breathe in the same line as the masters, and when you\u2019ve learned, you find your own expression. It\u2019s metaphorically powerful because it\u2019s how we all learn. I have some of my mother\u2019s gestures. My handwriting is the same as hers.\u201d Her mother\u2019s death, just after Thien\u2019s first book was published, was the spur to leave Vancouver. She married a Dutchman and briefly went to live in the Netherlands, before returning to set up home on the other side of Canada, in Montreal, where she now lives with the Lebanese novelist Rawi Hage. But China continued to call to her: \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been thinking about it, circling it, though I never really thought I\u2019d write about it.\u201d Research for Do Not Say We Have Nothing has involved travelling widely on her own, from a base in Shanghai up through the northwestern territories to the area where the Great Wall ends and the land turns into desert. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those places you can never quite see enough of it, it\u2019s vast. For the Chinese it\u2019s very odd for people to travel alone so I often get picked up by families and couples. You learn a lot from what people don\u2019t tell you.\u201d   Related: Do Not Say We Have Nothing by Madeleine Thien review \u2013 China\u2019s 20th-century tragedy    She considers herself fortunate to have a foreigner\u2019s immunity from political persecution \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not beholden to anyone who could be hurt\u201d \u2013 even though she has been outspoken about what she sees as a new authoritarianism in China, publicly criticising the closure of an innovative, intercultural creative writing master\u2019s course on which she has taught at the City University of Hong Kong since 2010. \u201cI hesitate to use the incendiary words of censorship, freedom of speech and intellectual freedom. However, it has become increasingly clear to me, as events have unfolded, that these are precisely the issues,\u201d she has written. This latest crackdown is yet another variation on the long-running theme of suppression of the individual, making it highly unlikely that either of her mature novels will be published in mainland China, though she hopes they may yet be in Hong Kong. It doesn\u2019t seem too far-fetched to describe them as her own Books of Records, embodying the difficult business of remaining imaginatively free while honouring \u201ccontested history\u201d. Each took her five years to write and, she says, she hopes her next book will take her somewhere less exhausting, \u201cthough my interests have always been political and historical so to some extent that will always find its way into my writing\u201d.

Meg (Knappett) is disgusted to find she\u2019s dating a gentleman, Bunny is convinced she\u2019s psychic and Laura starts a new job flogging broadband, which offers up a sea of eligible men.

Many say their mental health has suffered as a result of work pressures, while others cite workload as a reason for leaving the profession. So far, politicians have done little to tackle the issue. Our analysis, published this week, provides yet further evidence that policymakers must act. Using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data, we found that full-time teachers in secondary schools in England now work an average of 48.2 hours per week. This is the third highest out of 36 education authorities surveyed. It is also 19% longer than the OECD average.  We examined what impact this has on students, and what politicians can do about the problem.   Related: To keep burnout at bay, teachers must learn to say no | Kester Brewin    Long hours, low starting pay England\u2019s secondary school teachers spent an average of just four days on continuing professional development (CPD), including courses, observational visits, seminars and in-service training. This is far lower than the average of approximately 11 days across schools in other OECD countries. Work schedules are a barrier to accessing CPD according to 60% of teachers in England, compared to an average of 49% elsewhere. This has obvious implications for teacher effectiveness. But difficult working conditions also make the job less appealing compared to other professions, especially when relative pay is considered too. England is typical in that teachers are paid less than other workers of similar qualification levels. However, in England the ratio between teachers\u2019 working hours and the average for the whole economy is 17% greater than the average ratio across 13 other, mainly European, countries assessed.    Only 48% of teachers in England have more than 10 years\u2019\u200bexperience, compared with an OECD average of 64%    Long hours, low starting pay and limited access to professional development create a risk of teacher burn out, especially in the early stages of careers. Only 48% of teachers in England have more than 10 years\u2019 experience, compared with an average of OECD 64%. According to the OECD, England has also had one of the fastest reductions in the proportion of teachers aged over 50 in secondary education between 2005 and 2014. Whether or not a teacher can cope with long working hours is therefore likely to have as great an influence on whether they remain a teacher for the duration of their career as their effectiveness in the profession. Combined with extremely low levels of CPD, which might otherwise improve the effectiveness of teachers who need support to improve, this does not suggest a labour market that will help pupils flourish. Does this signal a national problem or, rather, bad practice in certain schools? The figures take a snapshot of the hours worked in a single week and cover, on average, 14 teachers in each school in the study. On this basis, working hours either vary substantially across the year or between individuals much more than they vary between schools. This represents a challenge for any body, for instance Ofsted, that wanted to objectively hold schools to account for working conditions. It also offers little hope that teachers will easily be able to identify schools where they can be assured of lighter work pressures, and may suggest that the approaches of heads of department are at least as important as school-wide policies. Most teachers believe the accountability system plays a role in workload and pressure. However, it appears unlikely that the government\u2019s focus on accountability will wane. Furthermore, teachers in good schools, based on Ofsted inspections outcomes, do not work much longer hours than others, so it does not appear to be the case that the current system creates an environment where the only way to succeed is to have your teachers work longer hours. Internationally, many high performing schools avoid long working hours: full time teachers in Shanghai worked an average of around 40 hours.   Related: Cramped classes and staff cuts: school budgets pushed to breaking point    What should be done about it? The department for education\u2019s profession-led policy reviews led to recommendations on planning, marking, and data management. This report highlights that teaching time is indeed not the key driver, both across countries and in comparisons between different teachers in England. So the focuses of the reviews are right and the findings should be heeded by school leaders. The data shows that the time England\u2019s teachers spend planning each hour of lessons is in line with the average across countries. This supports the opinions expressed in the Workload Challenge that it is important to use the time more effectively rather than dramatically reduce it. The report does not identify any silver bullets in terms of teacher practice. However, it does show that, for a selected class taught by those surveyed, those teachers who have pupils use ICT for class projects in all or nearly all lessons work 4.6 hours less per week than those who, at most, occasionally adopt this approach. The use of technology to save time is an area that appears ripe for further research and consideration by schools and teachers. Finally, those feeling more prepared for teaching are less likely to find their workload unmanageable.

Literally the \u201chigher examination\u201d, the gaokao is a national event on a par with a public holiday, but much less fun. Construction work is halted near examination halls, so as not to disturb the students, and traffic is diverted. Ambulances are on call outside in case of nervous collapses, and police cars patrol to keep the streets quiet. Radio talkshow hosts discuss the format and questions in painstaking detail, and when the results come out, the top scorers are feted nationally. A high or low mark determines life opportunities and earning potential. That score is the most important number of any Chinese child\u2019s life, the culmination of years of schooling, memorisation and constant stress. On 8 June, the final afternoon of this year\u2019s gaokao, parents of exam takers at one school in Beijing were packed tight around the school gate, jostling to get to the front of the crowd where a white metal barrier held them back. Special security guards handed out water bottles and cheap paper fans, while another manned a first aid stand under a large parasol. Cars were parked all the way around the bend of the road leading to the gate, simmering in the summer heat. \u201cThey\u2019re all here to pick up their kids,\u201d a city police officer patiently explained to a driver struggling to find a space. A red banner above the barrier declared the school a \u201cNational unified gaokao examination point\u201d. At the first sign of movement inside, the parents pushed in closer, craning their necks to spot their children emerging.   Related: Is China\u2019s gaokao the world\u2019s toughest school exam? \u2013 podcast    Shortly after 5pm, a student named Yuan Qi walked out clutching a clear pencil case and wearing a dazed expression. Around him, hundreds of exam-takers celebrated the end of their ordeal. Some clutched bouquets of flowers given to them by their parents; others posed awkwardly for photographs. Yuan Qi\u2019s father, an administrator in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, was dressed in shorts and a polo neck. He had been at the front of the crowd, holding his phone up high to record the moment. But when his son came out, he greeted him silently and led him away from the hubbub to where his mother was waiting. She took his pencil case to stop him fidgeting with it. \u201cHard?\u201d another parent asked Yuan Qi as they passed. \u201cDepends which subject,\u201d he replied. His father beamed with pride. Yuan Qi is 18, thin and wiry, with blue half-rim spectacles, close-cropped hair and budding wisps on his upper lip. A student at Beijing 101 school, one of the capital\u2019s most prestigious boarding schools, he is the nervous sort \u2013 constantly fiddling with stationery or picking at his fingers. He has a habit of rushing to the end of his sentences, slurring his words when excited, as if frustrated that telepathy is not an option. Ever since he was a young boy, growing up in Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing, Yuan Qi has had a talent for maths, science and problem solving. He loves reading murder mysteries, especially Agatha Christie novels in Chinese translation, which is how he came up with his English name \u2013 Hercule \u2013 although his moustache is yet to live up to it. The first time a teacher of his mentioned the gaokao, Yuan Qi was in primary school. Used as a distant incentive for working hard, the word kept cropping up in school and at the dinner table until it dawned on him just how high the stakes were. While college entrance is competitive in any country, in China the top universities can select as few as one in 50,000 students. Competition is intense for white-collar jobs, with a graduate unemployment rate of about 16%, and which college a student goes to has an immediate impact on career and even marriage prospects. That placement is decided by a single factor: their three-digit gaokao score.    Spy cameras, radios and earpieces that transmit questions and answers have been found hidden in pens and underwear    With so much to gain or lose, cheating is a big problem. Spy cameras, radio devices and earpieces that transmit questions and receive answers have been found hidden in jewellery, spectacles, wallets, pens, rulers and underwear. Most examination rooms install CCTV cameras, and some use metal detectors. Last year, police busted a syndicate in Jiangxi province, where professional exam-takers were charging parents up to a million yuan (\u00a3121,300) to pose as students. In Luoyang, a city in Henan province, examiners deployed a drone to hover above school buildings and scan for radio signals sent in or out. Fingerprint and iris-matching has been used to verify the identity of students. Exam papers are escorted to schools by security guards and monitored with GPS trackers, while the examiners who draft them are kept under close scrutiny in order to avoid leaks. This year, new regulations came into effect that could sentence cheats to up to seven years in prison. Yuan Qi was quietly confident. In his mocks he was averaging in the 690s, out of a maximum of 750 \u2013 good enough to get into the capital\u2019s elite universities. He had been cramming for 12 hours a day in the months leading up to the test, with extra classes at weekends. Since March, he had been operating on just six or seven hours sleep a night. Every possible step had been taken to maximise his chances of succeeding. The day before the first morning paper, his parents had rented a hotel room next to Tsinghua University middle school, where he would sit his papers, so that they could arrange his meals and attend to his every other need. By that point, Yuan Qi had spent so much time doing mock exams that he was totally inured to the real thing, which passed in a haze. \u201cIt went about usual,\u201d he told me as we walked back to his hotel, massaging his wrist. \u201cNothing out of the ordinary. Now I just want to go home and play some games.\u201d Yuan Qi\u2019s father was still recording videos of him, still grinning. \u201cThe exam is very nerve-racking, and each time when I was standing outside, before it began, I was terrified. But when you\u2019re actually taking it it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Now that the struggle was over, there was nothing he could do but wait for the result. * * *  The gaokao is emblematic of the Chinese education system as a whole. In the west, it is often seen as monolithic and rote; in China as tough but fair. In Europe and America, there is the notion that Chinese schools produce automatons incapable of critical thought; in China, many seem to think that western classrooms are full of students standing on desks and ripping up textbooks, \u00e0 la Dead Poets Society. Yet, where the Chinese model used to be roundly criticised for rewarding rote learning, now the system\u2019s gruelling schedule and supposed high standards are increasingly admired overseas. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, has praised Shanghai\u2019s school system with at times absurd hyperbole. (One column was fawningly titled \u201cThe Shanghai Secret\u201d.) Last year, the BBC invited two Chinese teachers to take over a sixth-form class in the documentary Are Our Kids Tough Enough? (Spoiler: they weren\u2019t, but nor were the teachers.) In China there are no illusions about the system being perfect. The exam is widely criticised for putting impossible pressures on children. Dissatisfaction with the gaokao is one reason that, among wealthier segments of the population, large numbers of students are choosing to study abroad. But, ultimately, most people support it, or at least see no alternative. \u201cChina has too many people,\u201d is a common refrain, used to excuse everything from urban traffic to rural poverty. Given the intense competition for finite higher education resources, the argument goes, there has to be some way to separate the wheat from the chaff, and to give hardworking students from poorer backgrounds a chance to rise to the top. The tradition of a single exam that decides a young person\u2019s prospects is one that goes back to antiquity in China. The imperial examinations or keju, which tested applicants for government office, was introduced in the Han dynasty (206BC to AD220), and became the sole criterion for selection from the 7th century until its abolition in 1905. Aspiring bureaucrats sat a three-day exam locked inside a single cell, in which they also slept and ate. The \u201ceight-legged essay\u201d was the most important paper, an argument in eight sections that elaborated on a theme while quoting from classics such as Confucius and Mencius. All applicants were checked for hidden scrolls; writing quotes on underwear was a popular form of cheating until examiners cottoned on. The pass rate was 1%. Nervous collapses were routine. There is even a ghost-deity associated with exams in China: Zhong Kui, a scholar who killed himself when he was denied first place.   Related: China\u2019s memory manipulators | Ian Johnson    While not a direct descendant, the gaokao is generally considered a distant relation of the keju. First instituted in 1952 under the new Communist government, the gaokao was suspended during the cultural revolution. Most universities were closed, and remaining college places were assigned according to political background rather than academic ability. It was only in 1977, the year after Mao\u2019s death, that the gaokao resumed in its modern form. The first sitting was open to generations who had been deprived of the chance to pursue higher education \u2013 5.7 million people enrolled, competing for just 220,000 university seats. Since 1978, it has been held every summer. The gaokao is made up of four three-hour papers: Chinese, English, maths and a choice of either sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) or humanities (geography, history, politics). The questions are mostly multiple-choice or fill-in-the-gap, and are notoriously hard \u2013 the maths paper has been compared to university-level maths in the UK. But for many students, the most intimidating element is the essay in the Chinese exam. Students are given an hour to write on one of two prompts, which are often infuriatingly elliptical. Prompts in 2015 included \u201cDo butterfly wings have colours?\u201d and \u201cWho do you admire the most? A biotechnology researcher, a welding engineering technician or a photographer?\u201d. This summer, Yuan Qi\u2019s choice was between \u201cOld accent\u201d and \u201cMysterious bookmark\u201d. (He picked old accent.) It is no surprise that, for many students, the pressure heaped on them by parents, teachers and themselves, is overwhelming. It is possible to retake the exam one year later, but if a student continues to fail there is no safety net or alternative path to university. Suicides are a regular feature of every exam season; a 2014 study claimed that exam stress was a contributing factor in 93% of cases in which school students took their own lives. Last year, a middle school in Hebei province fenced off its upper-floor dormitory balconies with grates, after two students jumped to their deaths in the months leading up to the gaokao. And the academic stress starts early \u2013 in July a 10-year-old boy tried to kill himself in oncoming traffic after fighting with his mother about homework. But still the study mill grinds on.

Photograph: Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for the Guardian    * * *  In April, two months before the exam, the campus of Yuan Qi\u2019s school was deceptively tranquil. A tree-lined boulevard led up to Beijing 101\u2019s front entrance, where two guards with truncheons watched over the security gate. Inside, the school buildings glistened in the sun, surrounded by spacious sports grounds and a lake with a goose house and lotus flowers. Students walked around in colour-coded slacks that, like all school uniforms in China, more closely resembled pyjamas: dark blue for year 11, mauve and white for year 12, purple for year 13. The school nestles into the west flank of Beijing\u2019s old Summer Palace \u2013 once the relaxation grounds of Qing dynasty emperors \u2013 and a back gate connects directly to the garden ruins. Founded in 1946, Beijing 101 was initially set up to educate the children of China\u2019s top officials, and it still has many such students among its ranks. It was an accomplishment for Yuan Qi to even be there. At his local primary school in Hebei province, there had been 70 to 80 children in each class. The school\u2019s football pitch was never used, as none of the teachers knew the rules. Yuan Qi\u2019s residency papers, or hukou, dictated that he should have stayed in Hebei for middle school, but his father used his connections in the People\u2019s Liberation Army and arranged a transfer to Beijing, with a new hukou. Once there, Yuan Qi enrolled in a better middle school and, thanks to a good performance in the zhongkao \u2013 the entrance exam for high school \u2013 got into Beijing 101 at the age of 16. Yuan Qi was now one step closer to securing his future at the college he dreamed of attending. Just a hundred metres down the road from Beijing 101, in the heart of the city\u2019s university district, lies Peking University (or Beida, as it\u2019s known in China). With its illustrious history, roll call of famous alumni and romantic campus dotted with lakes and stone bridges, Beida is the Chinese equivalent of Oxford or Cambridge. Ever since his parents first told him about it as a child, Yuan Qi had always dreamed of going there to study maths. His parents and teachers were encouraging, but even their expectations, he told me, were nothing like the pressure he put on himself. \u201cIn middle school I realised that primary school was easy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in high school I realised that middle school was easy.\u201d At Beijing 101, classes had just 20 to 30 students, but the work was twice as intensive as before. As Yuan Qi\u2019s grades were good, he was put into one of four \u201cexperimental classes\u201d in his year, which went at an even faster pace. And on top of his regular subjects, like all Chinese students, he also took two hours of politics class each week. They included the compulsory modules of Mao Zedong thought and Deng Xiaoping economic theory, which were introduced in 1991 as part of a patriotic education campaign. I ordered online one of the politics textbooks that Yuan Qi would be studying from. It was titled Integrity of Thought, and a typical page featured a cartoon of three boys sitting around a table discussing the latest government initiatives (as one does), with an accompanying discussion question for students: \u201cWhat are the everyday applications of these laws?\u201d The routine at Beijing 101 is punishing. At 6.30am Yuan Qi was out of his dorm bed, and he was in the canteen for breakfast by 6.50. At 7.20 came half an hour of self-study reading time. From 8am he had five 40-minute classes, broken by a half an hour of group calisthenics in the yard \u2013 a thousand students doing jumping jacks in unison \u2013 or running around the grounds. Another three afternoon classes were interrupted by five minutes of eye exercises, during which students massaged their tired brows while a recorded track told them to rub behind their ears and press their temples. School broke at 4.05pm, but there was still another three or four hours of homework to be completed before bed. As summer arrived, the pace picked up for Yuan Qi and his classmates. Almost all classes were now spent looking at past gaokao papers in methodical detail. After school, there were two extra hours of mock exams every day, on top of the homework, and five additional classes on Saturday. On Sundays, Yuan Qi\u2019s parents had arranged private tuition for him in English and Chinese. His only relaxation was playing computer games, but whereas in middle school he had enjoyed complex online roleplayers, now he only had time for smartphone apps. When I visited Beijing 101, the scene was not as disciplined as I had expected. School pupils in China are kids, after all, not robots \u2013 they goof around, joke, talk over each other. At the front gate as I waited to be let in, three boys were lifting up a fourth, giving him a wedgie. Inside was a bulletin board listing extra-curricular activities, from drama to traditional crosstalk comedy performances. A corrugated steel fence next to a basketball court was covered in graffiti, albeit sanctioned by the teachers and expletive-free: V for Vendetta; an alien face with the words \u201cOnce I was normal\u201d; \u201cBig Brother is Watching You\u201d, with one of the letters replaced with a swastika. But in class the students quietened down, listened carefully and took notes. In years of reporting in China, I have never heard a single student grumble about their workload. To them, it is simply normal.     The campus of Beijing University (Beida), one of China\u2019s top universities. Photograph: Gilles Sabri\u00e9 for the Guardian    I sat in on one of Yuan Qi\u2019s maths classes while the teacher \u2013 a tough but kindly woman with a strong Beijing accent \u2013 walked through exam-paper equations that left me feeling like a dunce. Yuan Qi followed along at his white plastic desk, where sheets covered in intricate geometrical squiggles were sprawled out next to his pencil case and a roll of toilet paper for blowing his nose. At the back of the classroom, a cartoon of Xi Jinping was drawn in coloured chalk on the blackboard next to the words \u201cWishing you a successful exam\u201d and a reminder: \u201c46 days\u201d. This countdown is a national obsession. If you search for \u201cgaokao\u201d on Baidu, China\u2019s largest search engine, in the months leading up to the exam, an image appears at the top of the results page, with a clock counting down to the start of the exam, next to a cartoon of a schoolgirl riding a flying book. Before Yuan Qi knew it, the countdown was at 30 days. 15. Ten. Five. With just three days left, on 4 June \u2013 while the rest of Beijing either forgot or ignored the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2013 Beijing 101 held a big pre-exam event in the main lecture hall: part pep talk, part rules refresher. Yuan Qi and his friends joked among themselves, half-listening while the headteacher went through the exam drill in excruciating detail, from how students should register with their IDs to what to do if they needed extra paper. At the end, all the teachers lined up and waved at their pupils from under a PowerPoint slide that read: \u201cWe have already done abundant preparation! Wishing you every success! Awaiting the good news!\u201d With that, 12 years of primary and secondary education were finished. The climax of it all was in sight. Yuan Qi went home, and got his head straight for the first paper. * * *  In China, the gaokao is sometimes described as a dumuqiao, which translates as \u201csingle-log bridge\u201d \u2013 a difficult path that everyone has to walk. But some have better shoes than others. Rich families lay on extra tutoring for their children in what Jiang Xueqin, a Canadian-Chinese education scholar, described as an \u201carms race\u201d among households looking to increase their child\u2019s chances. Provinces with larger populations have tougher standards of entry into the best universities, while those that are sparsely populated set a lower bar. (This loophole has led to illegal \u201cgaokao migrants\u201d transferring to schools in Inner Mongolia just before the exam.) Students in Beijing and Shanghai get special privileges \u2013 they are the beneficiaries of generous local quotas for the best universities \u2013 despite being more likely to be privileged anyway. \u201cScores are highly correlated with socioeconomic status,\u201d Trey Menefee, a lecturer at the Hong Kong Institute of Education, told me. I asked if he considered the exam meritocratic. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut almost every Chinese person does \u2026 Or it\u2019s meritocratic only because it\u2019s equally bad for everyone.\u201d There has been talk of reforming the gaokao for as long as it has existed, but little ever comes of it. The major concession in the early 2000s was to allow separate provinces to draft their own exam papers. This year, top universities trialled interviews with students who show special promise at school. Those who impress may be awarded extra points, which are added to their final exam score. Many students and their families have also called for the English paper \u2013 a stumbling block for many without access to private tuition \u2013 to be made optional.     Students revise for the gaokao in Jiaxing, China. Photograph: VCG/VCG via Getty Images    Meanwhile, relatively small changes can meet fierce resistance. In May, the government announced that a quota of 80,000 university places in Jiangsu and Hubei provinces would be reserved for students from poorer regions, in an effort to address provincial inequality. But mobs of middle-class parents took to the streets in six cities to protest against the measures, fearful that positive discrimination in favour of poorer families meant their own children would lose out. \u201cThe gaokao isn\u2019t for everyone,\u201d Jiang Xueqin told me. \u201cIt\u2019s for the middle class.\u201d When it comes to more comprehensive reform, the general consensus among education scholars in China is that any alternative would be too easily manipulated by the rich. Were coursework or regular school marks to be taken into account alongside exam grades, bribery would be even more rampant than it already is (parents often give \u201cred packages\u201d stuffed with banknotes to teachers in return for special attention for their child in class, or simply a seat nearer the front). The same goes for direct university admission. And so, futures are still decided by how well each child performs at a cramped desk in a closed room for two days in early June.   Related: China\u2019s funeral revolutionaries | Jonathan Kaiman    Not every student in China signs off their fate to the gaokao. Although more than nine million people still take it every year, the number is declining. This is partly down to the rising popularity of vocational courses, which often offer better prospects of finding a job after graduation, especially for those whose grades are less competitive. Above all, more and more students are heading abroad for university, and increasingly for high school. It used to be that the best students went to Beida; now they go to Harvard. There are more than 300,000 Chinese overseas students in US higher education and 90,000 in the UK. While many colleges overseas recognise the gaokao, it isn\u2019t necessary to take it to secure a place. Just as China\u2019s moneyed classes are deciding to protect their wealth by placing it overseas, their children are opting out of the country\u2019s education system on an industrial scale. One of Yuan Qi\u2019s classmates in the experimental class at Beijing 101, Jiang Xinye, joined the exodus. During her last year of school, by arrangement with her teachers, she stopped coming to class and instead prepared applications to US colleges. Her parents hired the services of Bridge International Education, a company that helps students select colleges and pull application materials together (the bill was roughly \u00a38,000; other companies charge up to \u00a320,000). Instead of the gaokao she took the TOEFL, an English proficiency exam, and her SAT, the US college-entrance aptitude test. She settled on a major in business, and wrote in her personal statement about her experience selling phone cases at school. With the help of a college counsellor she filled in forms for 12 universities. When it was all over she accepted a place at Brandeis, a private university in Massachusetts. Jiang Xinye feels strongly that her chosen path is preferable to that of many of her classmates. Chinese schools just teach the exams, she told me, even more so than abroad. \u201cWe don\u2019t solve problems ourselves,\u201d she said, \u201cthe teacher just tells you the right answer ... and refuses to hear different voices.\u201d One time, over a bowl of bibimbap in a Korean restaurant, the conversation turned to Yuan Qi and his other classmates who remained in the system. \u201cThey don\u2019t realise that their imagination is limited. Even if they want to voice their opinions, they are too timid to challenge the teacher.\u201d This struck me as the opposite of something Yuan Qi once told me: \u201cEverything has a right answer. Even if it\u2019s testing your argument, not the specific contents.\u201d That\u2019s why he disliked the more freeform essay question, while Jiang Xinye disliked everything else. While he sat the gaokao on 7 and 8 June, she was packing for America. Yuan Qi often asked me what school was like in the UK. I swallowed my guilt as I mumbled something about less homework and bad food. One afternoon he used a term, qiutubeilun, which I didn\u2019t understand. I looked it up on my phone: \u201cprisoners\u2019 dilemma\u201d, the famous paradox about mutual competition despite the benefits of cooperation. \u201cIf every [student] agreed to take it more easy, and pursue their own interests and hobbies, then the competition wouldn\u2019t be so intense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they would rather sacrifice that free time and spend all their time studying to have a greater chance of getting a high mark, and so everyone has to follow.\u201d     Parents wait for their children to finish taking the gaokao, outside the Beijing Renmin University Affiliated High School, one of the most prestigious in the country. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images    * * *  Yuan Qi sat at a corner window on the second floor of McDonald\u2019s, slurping a McCaf\u00e9 red tea before picking apart the empty cup. It was the morning of 23 June, two weeks after he had sat the exam, and the results would be posted online in a few minutes. The greasy wrapper of a crispy chicken fillet sandwich lay curled on the tray in front of him, next to a book titled Procrastination: Why You Do It and What to Do About It NOW. (In the margins, he had scrawled phrases such as \u201covercome fear\u201d and \u201cknow your weakness\u201d. Next to the sentence \u201cYou tell lies about how you organise your time\u201d, he had written, in English, \u201cME\u201d.) His phone was out on the tabletop and he checked it compulsively every few minutes, waiting for a text from his dad with his score. The previous fortnight had been stressful but not idle. The day after his final exam Yuan Qi was back at the grind again, preparing for an interview at Beida \u2013 part of the new measures that now allow elite universities to meet with promising candidates. It took place a week after the gaokao: there was a written maths test, which was a breeze, and a sit-down with three Beida teachers and five other students, talking about Confucian culture and theoretical maths. The teachers liked him but the outcome was token: they could only give him a maximum of 10 points to be added to his score. After it all, he would still be just a number. The results were released at noon. Most students checked them online, although they could also ring a hotline, or go to their school to check a printout posted on a bulletin board. Later, a full breakdown of their score would be mailed to each student, but for now it was a single mark for each exam and the all-important total, plus their ranking among other students in their province. Yuan Qi was so nervous that he couldn\u2019t bear to be at home. He asked his father to text him, and repaired to McDonald\u2019s instead. Noon came and passed. I tried to distract him with smalltalk, but he was fiddling uncontrollably. Why hadn\u2019t his dad texted yet? At 12:41, his phone buzzed. \u201cWhat is the score that you\u2019re hoping for?\u201d \u201cJust tell me, alright? ......\u201d Yuan Qi fired back. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me on tenterhooks ............!!!\u201d Another three minutes. Buzz. \u201cAre you on the first floor or the second floor?\u201d \u201cWhy in hell are you asking that for?\u201d \u201cIs it a good time to talk?\u201d \u201cJust send the text to me, you\u2019re not allowed to ring!\u201d \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d Yuan Qi was visibly straining not to be rude as he replied. \u201cCan you just send it, OK? Nothing\u2019s wrong, but if you keep not telling me then it will be!!!\u201d A minute passed in agonising silence. Then it came, with no gloss. \u201c664, ranked 1,020 in Beijing.\u201d It was significantly lower than Yuan Qi, or his parents, had expected. Still a high mark, an achievement: 1,020th out of 61,222 examinees in Beijing. But only the top 500 had a real shot at getting into Beida, where the cutoff point was generally taken to be 680. Yuan Qi\u2019s mock results were in the 690s but this mark, in his words, was \u201cordinary\u201d. Not even in the top thousand. His father texted again: \u201cIt\u2019s OK son\u201d. He stressed that they could apply to have his papers re-marked. But Yuan Qi was hyperventilating, taking short shallow breaths and pushing them out through pursed lips, as he stared at his phone. He scrolled down an online list of everyone\u2019s results in Beijing, to double-check his ranking. The Katy Perry song Teenage Dream was blasting over the stereo. His peers were posting their scores in messaging app groups for each of his classes. I didn\u2019t know what to say, and as a journalist I have never felt more intrusive as I watched a young man\u2019s hopes crumble before my eyes. Even with the full breakdown, Yuan Qi never knew exactly why he had underperformed. It was just one of those bad exam days.

He went swimming, took classes for the boardgame Go, learned how to ride a bike. And, now that it had served its purpose, his gaokao mark could be forgotten \u2013 no longer relevant, like much of the knowledge he had crammed to achieve it. Yuan Qi still didn\u2019t complain about the exam, even though, by its narrow definition of success, he had failed \u2013 just as the exam had failed to capture his individuality, his passion for learning and discovery. \u201cI don\u2019t feel disappointed so much as lost,\u201d he said, as we left McDonald\u2019s that day. \u201cIf it was just me, if I didn\u2019t have parents, then I would feel a bit better.

This was considered highly unusual for a player ranked only No16 in the world, but especially so that a 21-year-old Australian of any kind should be considered worthy of such heightened discourse in an august publication.   Related: Nick Kyrgios in new row: not returning shots and serving without effort    In most ways it sat firmly within its genre and rarely surprised, but one sub-plot stuck out. Tasked with unravelling the enigma that is Nick Kyrgios, his profiler Michael Steinberger focused his sights on the tennis star\u2019s obsession with Pok\u00e9mon Go, which for the time the writer spent with Kyrgios, he played incessantly with his entourage \u2013 a pair of junior tennis prospects, 13-year-old Tauheed Browning and 14-year-old Langston Williams. There was this:  They had bonded with Kyrgios over a shared infatuation with Pok\u00e9mon Go, the blockbuster mobile game, and the three were apparently now inseparable. They had gone to the movies and the mall together.  And also this, with regards to Kyrgios\u2019 girlfriend and fellow professional tennis star, Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107:  [Tomljanovi\u0107] didn\u2019t appear to mind sharing her boyfriend\u2019s attention with Browning, Williams and Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 although later in the day, at a photo shoot in West Palm Beach, she expressed some mild exasperation when Kyrgios, summoned to the wardrobe room, implored her to take over his game. \u2018I\u2019m not playing Pok\u00e9mon with your seven-year-old friend,\u2019 she said. Kyrgios quickly corrected her, albeit incorrectly: \u2018He\u2019s 10, not seven.\u2019  There are a number of conclusions you could draw from this, including not taking it entirely seriously, but the impression it left on me is that faced with the myriad pressures of a quite brutal and unforgiving professional sport, Nick Kyrgios is not only resisting adulthood, he\u2019s withdrawing himself further back into the comforts of childhood \u2013 the tantrums, the mood-swings, the trips to the cinema with 13-year-olds, and the Pok\u00e9mon Go. It says a bit about him and the strange world of tennis, but it also says a hell of a lot about us, and the way we\u2019ve treated him. It\u2019s no wonder he should surround himself with children and their uncynical, open-minded outlook on life. Later in the profile, Steinberger sees Kyrgios in full flight on the practice courts, a session in which he \u201cjust wants to play points\u201d and gives up after half an hour of running commentary for the amusement of those watching, including his two young friends, who are eventually brought onto the court too. Always the class clown. On Wednesday Kyrgios \u201ctanked\u201d a service point at the Shanghai Masters, which is clearly problematic, but as the match unravelled for him it also highlighted why we might resist caning the guy and perhaps just ask if he\u2019s feeling OK. Less than a week ago Kyrgios won his third ATP singles title at the Japan Open and appeared a world beater. Lleyton Hewitt said he should be setting his sights on the Australian Open trophy. Days later Kyrgios looks like he wants centre court to open up and swallow him. Those are pretty wild ups and downs for one young person in the space of a week. What\u2019s becoming clear is that Kyrgios is no more capable of handling the amplified emotional challenges of a life lived in the intense spotlight of pro tennis than any other person his age, and there\u2019s now a strong body of evidence to conclude that his coping mechanisms are really not up to spec. Yet he is also, I think, a realist and quite self-knowing. He said this after the match: \u201cYou want to buy a ticket? Come watch me. You know I\u2019m unpredictable. It\u2019s your choice. I don\u2019t owe you anything. Doesn\u2019t affect how I sleep at night.\u201d You\u2019d question the last sentence, because between checking his social media feeds and playing computer games, he rarely gets much sleep at the best of times, but who other than tournament organisers and integrity scrutineers can say Kyrgios actually owes them anything? His sponsors, perhaps? Maybe his family? He\u2019s certainly not representing his country when he\u2019s out there at a tournament like this. Even when he\u2019s falling apart he\u2019s more interesting than most players when they\u2019re playing well. Kyrgios says he can\u2019t grasp the frustration of fans. \u201cI can\u2019t really understand it at all,\u201d he said today. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through, so no, I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d They don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through. That\u2019s the excuse of a child, and a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s also true. It would be disingenuous of us to claim any understanding at all of what it\u2019s like to be him \u2013 all of that explosive talent and raw, childish emotion, but a total absence of the protective layer he needs to shield him from disastrous moments like this. If you ever find yourself at a tournament Kyrgios is playing at, don\u2019t just watch him on centre court \u2013 though that is definitely where his talent belongs \u2013 because there he is hemmed in at the sidelines by the suspicious, cynical and voyeuristic gaze of the mostly middle-aged audience who can afford seats close to the action.  Instead watch him on the practice courts, where you can see up close the full manifestation of his otherworldly talent, but also the internal forces that work constantly at cancelling it out; the darting eyes, the motor-mouth, the kiddish fragility and the inattentiveness.  Surrounding those practice courts, craning their necks, climbing fences and yelling out his name, you will also see an entirely different crowd, the one with whom Kyrgios most easily identifies and the one which sees the best and worst of itself reflected back almost every time he plays: children.

The diver survived, but the harrowing video shed light on a decades-old tourism industry that allows people to be within an arm\u2019s length of great white sharks, separated only by the sea and some metal bars.  \u201cThe truth, of course, was that the tourist got more than he bargained for, but on balance the shark came out the worse for wear,\u201d Samuel Gruber, a shark conservationist and founder of the Bimini SharkLab in the Bahamas, told the Guardian. \u201cClearly it was bleeding from the gills and from an area near the dorsal fin,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cIt is also clear to me that the shark was attracted to the cage for purposes of exciting footage.\u201d But Gruber said he did not oppose shark diving because he hoped it could \u201cturn those who hate and revile these magnificent creatures into ambassadors\u201d. He also emphasized that this incident was unusual, just like shark attacks. The diver, Chan Ming, was unharmed and said he was \u201creborn\u201d after the incident in a Facebook post that followed his viral fame. Chan had arrived home to Shanghai by the time footage of the incident was released on Thursday, racking up more than 9.5m views on YouTube. Chan said on Facebook that he did not blame the accident on anybody and called the diving vessel\u2019s team his \u201cheroes\u201d. \u201cNo one need to take responsibility,\u201d Chan said. \u201cThe boat teams are professional.\u201d Seconds after the shark entered the cage, the crew opened the cage\u2019s top hatch, allowing the shark to push out of the water and dive back into the ocean.  Being trapped in a metal cage is a particularly difficult situation for sharks, since they cannot swim backwards. Also, when great white sharks attack prey, they briefly close their eyes, creating a moment of unpredictability \u2013 even for the animal.  Jorge Cervera Hauser, a managing partner of Chan\u2019s diving vessel, Solmar V, also said in a statement that the incident was \u201cvery rare and unusual\u201d.  \u201cThe diver was completely unharmed after the incident, and the shark did not suffer any serious injuries,\u201d said Hauser. \u201cIt is also important to note that shark breaches of this magnitude are a one in a million occurrence.\u201d  Hauser said the vessel had been an injury-free operation since opening in 2004 and that the operation had also inspected and reinforced its cages. When the incident occurred, the vessel was off Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, one of two hotspots for great white shark cage-diving in the world along with Gansbaai, South Africa.  Depending on the location and length of time spent on the boat, trips can cost between $100 and several thousand dollars.  Chan was not the first person to get closer than he planned on one of these extreme encounters. In November 2007, Patrick Walsh was on a tour in Isla Guadalupe when a shark wedged itself through the bars of the cage. Walsh, like Chan, used an escape hatch to exit the cage while waiting for the shark to get out.  \u201cIt just snapped this cage to pieces, it was like it was made out of balsa wood,\u201d Walsh told Animal Planet.  Yet Walsh said the incident would not deter him from his love for sharks. \u201cI was back in the water 15 minutes after the accident,\u201d he said.  Chan had a similar reaction.

As with all of Koffmann\u2019s creations he has distilled his methods to their essence. The philosophy goes like this: \u201cI am a typical French chef. I work like any chef; I am hard to work for. I want the task done the way it should be. It is all about using few but the right ingredients. You have to be in love with cooking. You must enjoy eating. Oh, and you need a bit of luck!\u201d That\u2019s all. The secret, he insists, is that there is no secret. Koffmann is now 68. In the kitchen most days for the past 50 years he has applied himself to these principles every lunch and every dinner. He made his name at the Roux brothers\u2019 Riverside Inn at Bray, then at his own restaurant, La Tante Claire in Chelsea where, in 1983, he became the second chef in Britain to be awarded three Michelin stars. At La Tante Claire he was both mentor and occasional tormentor of a generation of chefs who watched him at work and learned: Marco Pierre White, Bruno Loubet, Tom Kitchin, Jason Atherton, Helena Puolakka and Gordon Ramsay all passed through his kitchen. These days they fall over themselves to credit him with all sorts of muscular praise. Kitchin says working with Koffmann was \u201clike I was on a bridge. I could have gone back to where I was nice and comfortable. But instead I crossed the bridge, and nothing scared me after that. It gave me mental strength.\u201d Puolakka, who was his sous chef at Tante Claire for five years \u201cstill gets goosebumps\u201d thinking about his impromptu mid-service tasting menus. White suggests that \u201cPierre influenced me on the plate more than any chef I have ever worked with\u201d and cites Koffmann\u2019s signature pig\u2019s trotters with morels and veal sweetbreads as his favourite ever dish. Back then they knew him, for his style, for the way he attacked each service, as \u201cthe bear\u201d.           The Frenchman who taught the British how to cook    Sitting at a table in his culinary home of the last decade \u2013 Koffmann\u2019s at the Berkeley Hotel \u2013 the moniker is hard to credit. He is courteous, charming, quick to laugh. But he insists it was well-earned. Before he was a chef, Koffmann was a rugby player \u2013 a lock forward or a number eight \u2013 in his native Gascony in the south of France. He played for his home town Tarbes, and for Toulon, before decamping to London \u2013 initially to watch a rugby match at Twickenham \u2013 and the ruck and maul of the kitchen. \u201cI always thought of being in the kitchen like being a captain of a rugby team,\u201d he says. \u201cI liked to think I was Jean-Pierre Rives [the buccaneering France skipper of the 70s] at the stove. It\u2019s the same in that you want your chefs to follow you into war each day. I looked after them well, but there had to be that intensity. Always a very small team. Even at Tante Claire we had never more than seven or eight in the kitchen including myself.\u201d    In the kitchen you have to be prepared to be a shit sometimes    It was, too, about always being at the top of your game. Koffmann stressed the importance of rest. \u201cWe were closed Saturday and Sunday. We started quite late and I insisted they went off and relaxed or slept for a couple of hours each afternoon. We had two weeks off at Christmas, two at Easter and in August. But when we were there, I expected a great deal.\u201d Times have changed a little for Koffmann now, but he still feels, with a grin that \u201cin the kitchen you have to be prepared to be a shit sometimes. I always wanted pressure. I think you do your best work when every service is a kind of a fight.\u201d He fears, with a laugh, he is becoming a grumpy old man. Or at least after a day on his feet his joints make him feel like that. \u201cOtherwise it is like yesterday.\u201d His routine hasn\u2019t changed much, though he can only really manage to eat one good meal a day now. He is proud that his disciples have mostly gone on to fame and fortune, but the attractions of having restaurants bearing your name in Shanghai and Qatar are lost on him. \u201cMy quality is to stay in one restaurant and cook every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is your job to know the quality of everything.\u201d For the first eight years of La Tante Claire that was literally the case. Even in 1985 Koffmann had to get all his food from France because the markets in London didn\u2019t offer what he needed. \u201cI had a guy who drove up on a Wednesday, delivering 20 poulet de bresse, pigeons, foie gras, mushrooms, everything. I used to go through everything by myself. One day Marco said, \u2018I\u2019ll do it for you\u2019 \u2013 and he did it as good as me. The first one.\u201d Despite his insistence that it was mostly perspiration not inspiration, I argue that there must have been magic moments. Did he often surprise himself?   Related: Pierre Koffmann: interview    Sometimes, he says, and he recalls not a dinner at Tante Claire but a Sunday on the beach in Wales with his family. \u201cThe kids went crab fishing, we had a bucket, you know, full of these little crabs, and the English idea is to throw them back. I cooked them instead, made a soup. I don\u2019t know why but on that day the soup was just perfect, the freshness of the crab just out of the sea. I could never make it again. So I remember that.\u201d Koffmann doesn\u2019t feel the need to reach for Michelin stars these days, but he is as determined as ever to keep exploring and refining and recreating the tastes he learned in his childhood. He has a theory that most great chefs learn from their grandmothers \u2013 they have more time to teach. His mother ran a cafe in Tarbes but it was on summer holidays on his grandparents\u2019 farm that his passion began. It was only a small place, but apart from some tripe or maybe some foie gras his grandmother would get in the village, everything they ate came from the farm: a lot of rabbit, chicken, duck. His grandmother never came to London but when he opened La Tante Claire she offered to send him two dozen chickens \u2013 \u201cI had to explain you couldn\u2019t just send live chickens from Gascony to London.\u201d After his grandparents died the farm was sold. He can hardly bear even to drive past it when he visits now. I wonder if he imagines retiring to France, but he suggests not. In fact, he has no plans to call it a day. It\u2019s strange because from the age of 25 he says he thought about retirement. \u201cWhen I was young I took a good insurance,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you are 25 you cannot imagine what it might feel like to be 45, so I thought that was a good age to retire. One day I was 45, and I thought I will go another five years.\u201d Koffmann\u2019s first wife died when he was 50 and he moved La Tante Claire from Chelsea to the Berkeley. \u201cThen at 55 I thought, OK, I need to stop now, take advantage of my insurance.\u201d For the first year he went travelling in search of tastes \u2013 to Japan, China. Then, back in London he would spend the morning wondering where to have a morning cappuccino, then where to have lunch, \u201cand I then trying to work out what to do with the rest of the day. A little siesta. Then maybe see my then girlfriend \u2013 now my wife \u2013 and I would be in bed by 9pm or 9.30pm. I lay there one time and said: \u2018Pierre, if you keep on this way, you will be dead of boredom in a year.\u2019\u201d He first was asked back to do a pop-up restaurant at Selfridge\u2019s for a week. In the end he did eight weeks: 120 seats sold out; 3,200 pigs\u2019 trotters. \u201cWhile you work, you are like a machine, a car,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything moves like it has always done. Then the moment service was finished my legs were like two broomsticks.\u201d He couldn\u2019t resist the challenge of another restaurant, though. And the appetite persists. \u201cYou go to market and you see the first asparagus, or the first peaches and it gives you ideas. If you are not excited by the product then you must stop. That hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d The next change is being forced upon him. Koffmann\u2019s at the Berkeley is closing at the end of the year because of a two-year renovation. Koffmann is weighing his options. \u201cI am not ready to retire again,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I need to find a little place to cook. Everything changes, you have to adapt.\u201d He might take some time off to take stock, he says. But ideally not longer than a fortnight.

Related: More than 4,000 arrested over illegal gambling on Euro 2016    The arrests follow a crackdown announced by China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security last year on foreign casinos targeting Chinese citizens. Gambling is illegal in mainland China, except through state-sanctioned lotteries, creating a market for casinos overseas to lure high-rollers to their shores. When the crackdown was announced, Hua Jingfeng, a deputy bureau chief at the Ministry of Public Security, said casinos in countries like Australia saw China as \u201can enormous market\u201d. \u201cA fair number of neighbouring countries have casinos, and they have set up offices in China to attract and drum up interest from Chinese citizens to go abroad and gamble,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis will also be an area that we will crack down on.\u201d According to Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Chinese authorities have three days in which to notify the government of the detention of the Australians, according to the terms of a bilateral consular treaty.  \u201cWe are aware of reports of the possible detention of a number of Crown International Group employees across China overnight on 13-14 October, including three Australians,\u201d a department spokeswoman said.  \u201cConsular officials will seek to offer appropriate consular assistance to the detained Australians in accordance with the consular services charter.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted China\u2019s foreign ministry for comment.  In a statement, the foreign ministry would only say the group was being detained for \u201cgambling crimes\u201d. Charles Livingstone, a gambling researcher from Monash University\u2019s department of health social science, said while he did not believe the Chinese government crackdown would affect casinos in Australia, it was \u201cpretty ominous\u201d for Crown group\u2019s casino in Macau.Macau is the only territory in China where casinos are allowed, and James Packer\u2019s Crown group has two resorts there. \u201cThe Chinese government periodically cracks down on gambling as it sees it as an outlet for corrupted funds,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cA lot of high-ranking officials and business people use it as a way of laundering money and showing off prestige and wealth.

In the narrow hutongs, their tones echo alongside the boisterous conversations of residents, the thick Beijing accent unmistakable anywhere. But these oases are never far away from wide-scale chaos: bad urban planning from the Mao era means that huge roads cut across the fabric of the city, so the sound of cars is a constant in the capital.  Best building     Gives you goosebumps \u2026 Zhengyici wooden theatre    Hidden in the southern part of the historical area of Qianmen, is one of the most wonderfully preserved wooden theatres in China, Zhengyici, built in 1688. The outside, in keeping with Beijing\u2019s traditional courtyard home style of siheyuan, is inconspicuous. But inside, it\u2019s a two-floor space with fantastic acoustics for classical performances, and fewer than 100 seats. The roofed stage, when flooded with light, flushes bright red \u2013 so atmospheric it can give you goosebumps. The theatre has hosted Beijing Opera from masters such as Mei Lanfang, and today it puts on some of the most original performing arts you\u2019ll see in the city, doing \u201cclassical with a contemporary twist\u201d very well indeed. Worst building     Even worse than the big underpants \u2026 housing blocks in the hutongs. Photograph: Yuan Ren    The ugliest building in Beijing isn\u2019t Rem Koolhaas\u2019s controversial CCTV tower, known commonly as the \u201cbig underpants\u201d due to its shape. More repulsive are a series of residential apartment blocks \u2013 bland, occasionally communist in style and akin to the UK\u2019s giant housing estates \u2013 which can be found bang in the city centre.  These blocks were built in the 90s and 00s after the one-storey housing in the hutongs was torn down for being too \u201cold\u201d, ironic given that many of their rapidly erected replacements have already fallen into disrepair. The complexes on the west side of Beixinqiao station, as well as Min An Xiaoqu nearby, are particularly oppressive.  Biggest controversy A year ago it was used to be pollution. But since hazy skies are less of a pain in the backside now, everyone is talking about how unaffordable the city has become. Housing prices in Beijing have skyrocketed in the last decade, and continue to soar inside the fifth ring road. Prices are closing in on those of London and New York; completely absurd given that the average salary in Beijing is merely a fraction of what it is in these cities (around \u00a3500 a month). Only residents with a Beijing household registration, known as a hukou, or who have paid taxes and national insurance for at least five years, can even think about buying. For the migrant workers that prop up much of the labour industry, many don\u2019t even get basic social benefits and are in danger of being kicked out. Young people from outside Beijing often rent shared rooms, or even dormitory housing (as cheap as \u00a330 or \u00a340 a month), some of them in illegal underground basements. Laws imposing higher taxes and deposits on second homes have seen buyers circumventing regulations by getting fake-divorced \u2013 a privilege given many don\u2019t even have the right to buy property in the capital. Homegrown talent            There\u2019s not much in the way of English-speaking talent, but Papi Jiang has become China\u2019s biggest internet sensation after her satirical rants on topics of popular culture went viral on Youku (A Chinese version of YouTube) earlier this year. In her classic \u201csurvival guide for males\u201d, she enacts what Chinese women really mean when they say reply \u201cnothing\u201d to their partner\u2019s questions, including the line: \u201cYou don\u2019t know my menstrual cycle and you dare say you love me?\u201d  Although she\u2019s originally from Shanghai, the capital is where Papi Jiang learnt her trade, honing her performance skills at the prestigious Central Academy of Drama, where she returned for graduate studies. Papi Jiang doesn\u2019t do live shows \u2013 the whole point is that she\u2019s a web celebrity.

While the nation is slowly coming round to the idea of less is more \u2013 Beijing is at the forefront of the transition.  Long, drapey but slightly old-fashioned dresses are a popular style; for colder days, skinny jeans and sports trainers is a favourite combination with young women. In the summer, \u201clegs out\u201d is go-to for girls \u2013 thigh-gripping jeans shorts paired with platforms or high heels (with socks) are everywhere. But while high on the leg is OK, low cuts on top will still get you a stare.  What is your city\u2019s most under-rated location?     Haunting \u2026 the former Duan Qirui government building. Photograph: Jens Schott Knudsen    Next to Zhangzizhonglu underground station is a complex that is mysterious and spectacular. The Duan Qirui Former Government Building, constructed in the early 20th century, is unkempt. Many of the buildings are disused, with the back ones acting as dormitories for Beijing\u2019s Renmin University (a bit underutilised, you would think, given the historical value of the site). Anyone can stroll in, although the complex is gated \u2013 say you\u2019re visiting Peanut Cafe and keep striding along. What does Beijing do better than anywhere else? The Jianbing. These are crispy folded pancakes with an egg cracked on to them and spread out with a wooden spatula, all on a flat round pan. A layer of deep fried crispy dough is later added in the middle, sprinkled with hot and savoury sauces, spring onions and coriander, and then folded over. Different types of pancakes are often on offer, including wholegrain, purple rice and buckwheat rice.

He likes to shoot early or late in the day, when Beijing \u201cfeels like a different world\u201d, he says. \u201cAt 6am it\u2019s quieter, less crowded, but there is still a lot of life on the streets \u2013 from sleepy eyed workers to school children lining up for breakfast snacks.\u201d How green is your city? Not very. Beijing is known for its smoggy days, but things are improving since the government decided something had to be done \u2013 all the news coverage from abroad was becoming an embarrassment. There has been an effort to shut down polluting industries around the city since, or at least move them elsewhere.  While no congestion charge exists, different digits on vehicle number plates are banned from the roads on different days of the week. The city that was once home to \u201ca million bicycles\u201d is forgoing them for public transport and cars though.  And to shortcut the route of cleaning up pollution, the city has plans to literally \u201cblow away\u201d urban smog, particularly in winter when it\u2019s worse, by creating \u201cventilation corridors\u201d, channels for the wind through the city\u2019s green spaces.   Moment in history             Beijing was a fortified city with an extensive system of inner and outer city walls, gates, watchtowers and defence that was not just mechanically advanced, but architecturally spectacular.  That all changed in 1949 when, with a view to making Beijing the next Moscow, Mao ordered the tearing down of Beijing\u2019s city wall, which ran in a circle along what is now the inner ring road. With the city\u2019s defence destroyed (it took decades to pull down), much of the inside also underwent reconstruction in the 90s \u2013 historical areas were heavily rebuilt and turned into featureless apartment blocks. Parts of the inner city have since become heavily commercialised, such as the area near the Drum and Bell tower \u2013 the old clock towers of Beijing; Nanluoguxiang alley close by has been made into a famous \u201csnack street\u201d that is now forever chockablock with people and waste \u2013 a no-go area for locals.

The streets surrounding it are where locals go for snacks (xiao chi); Huguosi Xiaochi is a popular joint, as well as many other restaurants on the same stretch. There used to be a huge market, but when it was shut down in recent years, many of the stalls spilt on to Mianhua Hutong, which now overflows with food vendors and fresh produce.

In the end, it is not about you, me or the paying punters he so disrespected with his shameful exhibition of indolence against Mischa Zverev in Shanghai last week, the sheer egregiousness of which compelled the ATP to slap Kyrgios with a suspension that has been a long time coming. Those of us who enjoy the theatre of Kyrgios at his best, having thrilled at the insouciance of his breakthrough victory over Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon two years ago, would find it immensely disappointing to watch him fade away, but we would soon move on with our lives. Ultimately it is up to the rebellious Australian to decide whether he is willing to make the necessary sacrifices to reach the top, to discover whether he truly loves the sport that has turned him into a star with the potential to conquer the world and earn millions.   Related: Nick Kyrgios suspended until mid-January by ATP over Shanghai conduct    One can have sympathy for a 21-year-old who is struggling to cope with fame and responsibility without failing to recognise that he is letting himself down, assuming that tennis is what he is supposed to excel at for the next 10 or 15 years. While Kyrgios is unsure, he has said that he does not know how to exist without tennis. It is both a blessing and a curse that he is a flawed genius with a racket in his right hand. It is easy to understand why the ATP, almost acting out of a duty of care, has banned and fined Kyrgios until 15 January for his conduct in his 6-3, 6-1 loss against Zverev. The lack of effort Kyrgios put into his serve and groundstrokes could be seen as a cry for help and given that he has been accused of tanking in the past, the ATP had no choice but to act. The decision was not remotely controversial. For his part, Kyrgios apologised on Monday and there are indications that he will accept professional advice, with the ATP saying that his suspension will end on 7 November if he accepts the help of a sports psychologist. That would be a step in the right direction. Some of Kyrgios\u2019s critics see a spoilt brat who has been given too much too soon. Some of his antics have been in dismal taste, such as the slur he aimed at Stan Wawrinka and the Swiss player\u2019s girlfriend, Donna Vekic, last year. Others have been those of a young man melting in the spotlight. Tennis is mentally punishing. All alone on the court, watched by thousands but unable to lean on any of them in the toughest moments, many players suffer and wilt in the heat of battle. No one is immune, even the very best. Novak Djokovic has slumped since completing the career slam at the French Open in June, a crucial dip in intensity denting the world No1\u2019s aura in the past few months. Who wants it more? It sounds like a cliche but it applies here. Sometimes, the top players sneak over the line thanks to their stubbornness. Kyrgios looks ill-equipped to succeed in such a demanding environment, hopping from one country to the next for yet another tournament, and he has often sounded racked by self-doubt while discussing whether he likes tennis. \u201cI don\u2019t have a doubt that if I wanted to win grand slams, I would commit,\u201d he told the New York Times before the US Open. \u201cI\u2019d train two times a day, I\u2019d go to the gym every day, I\u2019d stretch, I\u2019d do rehab, I\u2019d eat right. But I don\u2019t know what I want at the moment.\u201d What does Kyrgios actually want? This is a professional athlete who warmed up for his defeat to Andy Murray at Wimbledon by playing computer games before admitting that his performance was pathetic. He called himself soft. His words hinted at a contradiction: his preparations were slack, but it was possible to detect disgust at the way he rolled over against Murray, which at least suggested that he does take pride in his output on the court. The ATP\u2019s tough love could be a turning point for Kyrgios. Only last week, however, he was rubbishing the idea that he would ever employ a coach who might be able to improve his focus. That, after all, does sound a lot like hard work. But a steadying influence is what Kyrgios needs and the situation is likely to become chronic without one. Maybe it makes no difference. Maybe tennis is not for him. Whatever path Kyrgios chooses, all we can do is hope that he does not end up with regrets.", "tags": ["Nick Kyrgios", "Australia sport", "Tennis", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-10-17T17:21:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/18/crown-resorts-meets-with-officials-to-try-and-establish-fate-of-casino-staff-arrested-in-china", "sentences": ["In a statement issued on Monday evening, the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said: \u201cConsular officials in Shanghai are making arrangements to visit the Australians to offer appropriate assistance, all of who have legal representation provided by their employer.\u201d While Chinese authorities have yet to declare what the detainees have been charged with, Fairfax Media reported that charges were expected to be laid on Tuesday."], "title": "Crown Resorts meets with officials to try to establish fate of casino staff arrested in China", "article": "Crown Resorts has met with staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as it tries to establish the fate of 18 of its staff arrested four days ago during raids in China.

Born in Hong Kong, she went, as a young woman, to study in Melbourne, where she met my father and fell in love. They settled in Malaysia but, a decade later, emigrated to Canada; by then, they had two small children and my mother was six months pregnant with me. She was not yet 30 years old. She arrived with little, and for the next 30 years would work multiple jobs to keep us all afloat. She told me she wanted to see the Three Gorges before the building of the massive hydroelectric dam, when the waters would rise by 175 metres, submerging nearly 1,500 villages. We planned our trip for 2003, but she died suddenly, at the age of 58, three months before we were due to depart. I didn\u2019t cancel our trip. Speaking almost no Mandarin, I set out on the journey she had imagined, and travelled from Hong Kong to Shanghai, from Xi\u2019an to Luoyang to Beijing. As I went, rumours of an epidemic, which would turn out to be Sars, shut the country down behind me. I felt my life had already been overturned by losing my mother and didn\u2019t realise, until years later, that this three-week solitary journey marked another tumultuous change.     Madeleine Thien: \u2018To write a novel is to find many other ways of being alive.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    There was so much about China I didn\u2019t understand. And yet in the encounters I had, which ranged from comic to astounding to absurd to soul-shifting, I felt that there was much I could understand, but only if I was attentive, open and utterly myself. In more than a decade of returns to China, I learned a necessary lesson: how to absorb a place with humility, and in the process how to live with myself \u2013 the ways I felt I had let my mother down, the failure to change her ending, all the complex, contradictory desires that I felt. Do Not Say We Have Nothing begins with a mother and daughter in the Vancouver where I grew up. From there it spirals out to a world of imagination interleaved with history. I wanted to write a novel about the conditions left behind by a century of political revolution, and about a present moment that is as intricate as a single lifetime. I immersed myself in the expressive worlds of music, the filial act of copying, survival in an age of destruction, in the effort to understand how a person tries to be free. Bach\u2019s Goldberg Variations played in my head and on the page, showing me how structural constraint \u2013 limitations on freedom \u2013 might provoke artistic creativity, individuality, resonance. To write a novel is to find many other ways of being alive. I wanted to bring to life not myself and not my mother, but the imaginary and forever incomplete world between us. This is my fourth book and the one, for reasons I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever know, in which I felt unafraid and free. \u2022 Published by Granta.

David Szalay All That Man Is      I knew I didn\u2019t want to write a conventional novel. What I actually did want to write was of course harder to say. As so often happens, I stumbled into it by chance. In the autumn of 2012, I wrote a 30-page story for Granta. It was called \u201cEuropa\u201d and it was about a Hungarian prostitute and her male minders, one of whom is also her boyfriend, travelling to London for a week of high-end money-making. At the time I was disenchanted with the whole enterprise of writing fiction, and this simple, self-contained little tale was a way of feeling my way back to some sort of enthusiasm for it. In that respect, it certainly succeeded, because I found that by the spring of 2013 I had a definite appetite for writing more. Specifically, I had this idea of a book of stories that would speak to each other somehow, that would work together to express things that none of them would be able to express on their own. Such a book would need some kind of unifying scheme or structure. The first idea was that it would be a book about Europe \u2013 that each of the stories, like \u201cEuropa\u201d, would be about a person or a group of people from one European country travelling, for some reason, to another European country. It would be a book about the extreme human fluidity of contemporary Europe. (This was, remember, three and a half years ago, and the word Brexit didn\u2019t even exist \u2026) These ideas, of a Europe in motion, are of course there in All That Man Is, but it was quickly clear to me, as I pondered my unwritten book back in 2013, that the European theme was really just that \u2013 a theme, not a structure. It was simply not strong enough to fuse the disparate stories (only one of which had then been written) into a single, unified, indivisible work. Something more was needed.     David Szalay: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to write a conventional novel. What I did want to write is hard to say.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    I found that something in a dreadful sonnet I had written a year or two previously. During my disenchantment with fiction, I had spent a while tinkering ineffectually with traditional verse forms, and one of the very worst poems I had written was a sonnet on the subject of the three ages of man. Happening to reread it one afternoon, I had one of those rare, clarifying moments that all creative artists are so grateful for \u2013 those moments when the door that you have been battering yourself against for weeks or months just swings open of its own accord. The book would be a series of stories about progressively older male protagonists \u2013 starting in adolescence and ending in retirement \u2013 and their stories would embody the massively simple and seemingly timeless notion of life as three stages: youth, maturity and old age. I then just wrote the stories. Initially there were seven, a nod, perhaps, to Shakespeare. Later I expanded the number to nine, first of all to smooth over a couple of jumps that seemed too abrupt \u2013 I was very keen for time to sneak up on my men, as it does in life \u2013 \u201cAh! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,/ Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived\u201d \u2013 and also to achieve the pleasing symmetry of three stories for each of the three ages. All of the stories, with the exception of \u201cEuropa\u201d, were conceived specifically to fit into their place in the structure of the book: this was not a collection of disparate material organised opportunistically into book-form; it was the form of a single book organising the material of reality into conformity with its conception. \u2022 Published by Vintage.

Deborah Levy Hot Milk      I wanted to write a novel about hypochondria. This is a massive, daunting subject, and I did not know where it would take me. However, I knew from the start that I would call it Hot Milk, for the many queasy associations this title triggers. A mother and daughter would embark on a modern pilgrimage to seek a cure for a mysterious and undiagnosed illness. It would be set in an ideologically turbulent and fragile Europe \u2013 but where? In the end I decided to land my characters in a fishing village in the semi-desert of southern Spain, a landscape I know well. Over the years, I had observed how the desert is never silent and never still \u2013 the cries of small animals at night, the shrubs that vibrate with invisible insects, all of this had got under my skin. I wanted to use this parched, vast terrain to write about a young woman in her 20s who is ashamed of her small life and of her own despair. She would be the main carer for her mother, who perhaps (this was not set in stone) uses her various aches and pains as a means to control her daughter and keep her by her side, way after she should have left home. The theme of hypochondria offered a rich menu to explore the ways in which the body speaks for us. It\u2019s a strange language, this grammar made from mysterious symptoms that apparently defy diagnosis. It\u2019s as if the hypochondriac wants to mess up the story a physician might offer her, a bid to not be pinned down to a single narrative. Likewise, it\u2019s hard to pin down Hot Milk to a single storyline; there are multiple stories about the contemporary world within the main daughter-mother relationship. Yet, I was very taken by a deceptively simple quote from H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous: \u201cWe live in a history not a story.\u201d The history of the daughter in Hot Milk, Sofia, is that she has witnessed how her mother\u2019s wishes and hopes for herself have been lost in the winds and storms of a world that is not arranged to her advantage.     Deborah Levy: \u2018I wanted to write about hypochondria. But it\u2019s a massive subject and I didn\u2019t know where it would take me.\u2019 Photograph: Leonardo Cendamo/Writer Pictures    Sofia fears this will be her fate, too. She wants to transcend this history, to make another plot. In this quest, it was important to me to honour and give value to the more radical dimensions of human experience \u2013 the ways in which we are irrational, chaotic, superstitious, recklessly brave and hopelessly vulnerable. Hot Milk is written in the first person from Sofia\u2019s point of view. The novel is her anthropological gaze on everything. To my surprise, the Medusa myth and her monstrous gaze began to tiptoe lightly through my book. Hot Milk puts the Medusa to work to ask Sofia a question: what is so \u201cmonstrous\u201d about a young woman, who constantly has to endure the violence of the ways in which she is societally gazed upon, returning that gaze full-on? What would it take to insert her subjectivity into the world, instead of looking away? \u2022 Published by Hamish Hamilton.

In some ways it\u2019s an incantation, an attempt to recreate the spellbinding warmth of the Santa Ana winds, the weightless days spent bodysurfing at Santa Monica beach, the joy of chasing Butch \u2013 the family dog \u2013 around the backyard peach and lemon trees. It\u2019s racing home after school to drink ponche [fruit punch] and watch The Little Rascals on TV with the Chacon family. After which, me and the boys Jerry, Charlie and Billy, and sometimes Ronald Keaton, would beg the neighbourhood celebrity, Eddie Smith, founder of the Black Stuntman\u2019s Association (he\u2019s one of Clubber Lang\u2019s cornermen in Rocky III), to fulfil his promise of putting us in the movies once we got our work permits. Conversely, The Sellout is also a talisman, a vain effort to ward off and mollify the curse and contradictions of being working class and coloured in the mostly white Westside Los Angeles and, by extension, America. All the running we did from the police, the local bullies and stray dogs. The saccharine smell of angel dust [PCP]. The beatings. The fear. The local suicides. The Bob\u2019s Big Boy massacre, and despite the rising crime rate, the market value of my mom\u2019s nondescript three-bedroom home skyrocketing during the housing boom because it\u2019s West LA dammit! It\u2019s Ralph Nader, a hero of mine, pondering whether president-elect Barack Obama would be Uncle Sam or Uncle Tom. Two black American cabinet members, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, championing an obviously frivolous and unjust war. But if I really think about it, the closest thing to a true genesis is a drive I make whenever I go home to LA. At a 100-mile round-trip, it\u2019s a night-time cruise that usually starts by embarking north on Robertson to Sunset Boulevard, then west toward the Pacific Coast Highway. Hard to put into words how important this drive is for me. I leave drab art deco LA for the palatial beauty of Beverly Hills and the Palisades, the seascapes of Malibu and Zuma, and my childhood memories morph into imaginings of who I would be had I never left the city.     Paul Beatty: \u2018The Sellout is a vain effort to mollify the curse and contradictions of being working-class and coloured in LA.\u2019 Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images    The black, treasure hunting, surf bum I still hope to become, passing my metal detector over the sand looking for doubloons and jewellery left behind by Spanish tourists from the 18th and 21st centuries. Always smoothly paved, when the traffic is light, it\u2019s as close as California gets to the autobahn, and speeding toward the stars, one hand on the wheel, the other trying to keep the jazz signal for KLON (now KKJZ) tuned in, is where I \u201cwrote\u201d this book. Thinking about the one good memory of my dad \u2013 me age six, in his lap \u201cdriving\u201d the Karmann Ghia along the coast and into the wind \u2013 about what it means to call a city I don\u2019t really know home, and the countless hours of research I\u2019d have to do to figure that out, in addition to the mysteries of the LA transportation system, surf breaks, and what it means to be black. Recently, in a BBC interview, George the Poet asked me if I was a pan-Africanist, and this book is me shrugging my shoulders in bewilderment, because I\u2019m not even a pan-Paul Beattyist. \u2022 Published by Oneworld.

Ottessa Moshfegh Eileen      Within a few weeks of moving to Los Angeles in the fall of 2011, I met a young film-maker who was in the middle of shooting a documentary about juveniles sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. One story he told me will be lodged in my mind and heart forever. It involved a boy whose father had sexually abused him for years, and whose mother had been complicit in the abuse. The boy killed his father, and will live the rest of his life in prison. A year later, when I set myself the task of writing a novel, that story resurfaced in me: why do we hurt the people we love? Why is denial so powerful? Can we ever escape the identity we\u2019re born into? What does it mean to be free? To be honest, the answers to these questions frightened me. I was scared to confront my optimism for fear that it would be shot down with painful truths such as \u201cThere is no such thing as altruism,\u201d and \u201cViolence and trauma are basic elements of life on Earth,\u201d and \u201cThere is no escaping who I am,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll only be truly free when I\u2019m dead.\u201d That fear was the flare that lit the path to discovering my narrator, Eileen Dunlop, and ways by which she could narrate through these complex and disturbing issues. Eileen was to be my first novel, and I wanted it to appeal to a wide range of readers, from those literary types who had known me as a short-story writer, to travellers who might be browsing through the airport bookstore looking for a quick read on a flight. I decided to take a traditional novel structure and see what would arise if I followed certain narrative cues (plot points, you could say). I even bought a book called The 90 Day Novel to educate myself about the stylistic and structural conventions of mainstream fiction. I laughed at how simply the three-act structure of the novel was laid out, as though art could be made by plugging random variables into an algebraic formula.     Ottessa Moshfegh: \u2018Why do we hurt the people we love? Why is denial so powerful? What does it mean to be free? These are the questions that frightened me.\u2019    I saw that the structure existed as a distillation of works over the past century, what we\u2019ve come to understand as \u201cclassics\u201d. The structure is very much like the three-act structure used as a template in Hollywood films. I liked the idea of a reading experience that played with a reader\u2019s canned expectations. So I took the traditional form and said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d I thought it would be an interesting creative experiment, sure, but I also knew it was the perfect architecture to house the larger question at hand: can you be free within the confines of a system? I discovered that I could not, but that limitations can sometimes lead to ingenuity. So I invented Eileen. She is a single woman in her early 20s in a small town in coastal New England. She works at the juvenile prison and cares for her alcoholic father, a retired cop. I chose to set the book in 1964 because America was on the precipice of a great cultural transformation at that time, and I envisioned Eileen\u2019s story as a transformation, too. I decided to make Eileen\u2019s story run in tandem with the inspiring story of the young man in prison; his was not my story to tell, but Eileen\u2019s felt very close to my own, at least emotionally. Lastly, I envisioned the book as a satire, which gave me permission to push the narrative into awkward extremes. Why did I not take a straightforward approach? When you look directly into the eyes of the beast, it attacks you. It is best to come around from the side. More is revealed to you that way. \u2022 Published by Vintage.

Graeme Macrae Burnet His Bloody Project      On 3 June 1835, a French peasant named Pierre Rivi\u00e8re murdered his mother, sister and brother \u2013 this act ostensibly carried out to free his father from what Rivi\u00e8re saw as his mother\u2019s tyranny. What made the case exceptional, however, was not the violence itself, but rather that Rivi\u00e8re then wrote an eloquent account of what he had done. In 1838, a Stornoway tenant farmer named Malcolm MacLeod strangled his wife Henrietta. A relative testified that he \u201chad a peculiar temper owing to some strange notions he had formed in his head\u201d; yet in a letter to his brother written from prison, MacLeod was capable of writing this: \u201cWhat can I say to you but I have a low eye and a trembling heart and a low hope that the Lord have mercy on me, a poor cursed man.\u201d This idea of an individual capable of an act of terrible violence yet also able to write articulately about what they have done fascinates me, and was the initial spur for His Bloody Project. My research led me to the concept originating in 19th-century criminal psychology of \u201cmania without delirium\u201d or \u201cmoral insanity\u201d, a condition whereby an individual might be seized by \u201cparoxysms of maniacal fury\u201d, yet at all other times appear to be fully in possession of their reason. My protagonist, Roddy Macrae, a 17-year-old crofter who kills three people in the tiny village of Culduie in 1869, began to form in my mind. It was quite natural for me to set my story in the barren but stunning landscapes of Wester Ross. My mother\u2019s side of the family comes from there and I have been visiting the area all my life. The Scottish Highlands, however, is not the rural idyll imagined by the Victorians. It has a dark history of clan warfare and later of the brutal \u201cclearances\u201d, when crofters were forced off the land to make way for the more profitable ventures of sheep farming and gaming estates. An inventory of 25 regulations governing the lives of crofters in Lewis in 1881 brought home to me the draconian nature of the regimes under which the native population lived. The cropping of heather from the hills, taking fish from the burns, harvesting shellfish or even seaweed from the shore: all were outlawed. Thus, the feudal conditions under which Roddy Macrae lives form a backdrop to his crimes.     Graeme Macrae Burnet: \u2018I was fascinated by the idea of an individual capable of terrible violence, and also writing articulately about it.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian    But historical research and abstract ideas alone will not bring a novel to life. As a reader, I want to feel immersed in the milieu of a novel; I want to feel I am inside the head of the protagonist. And these are the challenges I set myself as a novelist, to evoke the setting of the book vividly and burrow deep into the psychology of my protagonist. The \u201cfound document\u201d structure of His Bloody Project, in which readers are presented with a range of conflicting viewpoints on the events of the narrative, is an invitation to play detective; for readers to decide for themselves the truth of what has occurred. Or else to conclude that it is not possible to determine an objective truth about any event, either recent or historical. \u2022 Published by Saraband.

CHAMPIONS TROPHY TICKETS There were 417,000 applications from 60 countries for the first tranche of tickets for next year\u2019s ICC Champions Trophy, which takes place across England and Wales in June. Disappointed fans, and there are likely to be many with 11 of the 15 matches already subject to a ballot for places in certain price bands, have another shot at attending when the remaining tickets go on sale on Thursday at 2pm from www.icc-cricket.com/ticket. There is still availability at the following games: New Zealand v Australia at (Edgbaston, 2 June), Sri Lanka v South Africa (The Kia Oval, 3 June), Australia v Bangladesh (The Kia Oval, 5 June), England v New Zealand (Cardiff Wales Stadium, 6 June), Pakistan v South Africa (Edgbaston, 7 June), India v Sri Lanka (The Kia Oval, 8 June), New Zealand v Bangladesh (Cardiff Wales Stadium, 9 June), Sri Lanka v Pakistan (Cardiff Wales Stadium, 12 June), semi-final A1 v B2 (Cardiff Wales Stadium, 14 June) and semi-final A2 v B1 (Edgbaston, 15 June). The first batch of tickets for the 2017 women\u2019s World Cup, taking place in England in late June to July, are also now on sale at the ICC website, with the ballot to apply for places at the final open until 1 November. MURRAY TIE-BREAKER On a ten-match winning streak after taking titles in Shanghai and Beijing, Andy Murray continues his attempt to become world No1 on Sunday but in a shift from the full game at the tennis equivalent of Twenty20. He competes in the Tie Break Tens event in Vienna (Sky Sports 4, 6pm), where players face off in a first-to-ten-points tie break format with a $250,000 prize on offer. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Dominic Thiem and Tommy Haas are drawn in one group, with Murray facing the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic and Britain\u2019s Marcus Willis, who while ranked No 772 in the world earned great acclaim this summer by winning seven matches to meet Roger Federer in the second round at Wimbledon. He is pleasingly optimistic about the tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s 10 points. Accrington Stanley would lose to Manchester United over 90 minutes, but in a 10-minute match they would stand a chance. I think it will suit my game,\u201d he said. GOLF FINALE The last round of the World Golf Championship begins on Thursday (Sky Sports 4, 4am) and has attracted a remarkable entry list. Forty-three of the top 50 players will be competing, including eight of the top 10. All four of 2016\u2019s major winners will be there, from the US Open, Dustin Johnson, who won the 2016 PGA Tour Player of the Year award last week, the Open champion, Henrik Stenson, the Masters Champion, Danny Willett, and the US PGA winner, Jimmy Walker. Rory McIIroy also joins the party, all looking to topple the defending champion, Scotland\u2019s Russell Knox. LOOK OUT FOR \u2026A TEMPEST IN STRATFORD We\u2019re previewing Shakespeare now? The other Stratford. The east London one, where locals are battening down and tensing up before this week\u2019s EFL Cup tie: West Ham v Chelsea at the Olympic Park. That could be lively. That\u2019s the fear. It\u2019s not a draw the stadium operator needed \u2013 Chelsea weren\u2019t due to visit until March next year. As it is, they\u2019re coming on Wednesday, and the \u201csecurity fears grow\u201d headlines are everywhere. These tough stories for West Ham just keep coming. They do. They\u2019ve been collecting controversies like Panini stickers since the summer. Ticketing complaints? Got. State-aid accusations? Got. Safety concerns? Got. Crowd trouble? Got. Atmosphere complaints? Got. A sense of optimism and belonging? Need. Still not feeling like home then? Fans have spent most of their time in the new ground singing: \u201cWe should have stayed at the Boleyn\u201d, and \u201cStratford\u2019s a shithole, we want to go home.\u201d So no, not really. How are the club preparing for Wednesday? The focus is all on the stewarding, as provided by the landlord. Stadium staff have struggled this season at low-risk games with only 3,000 away fans \u2013 this week there will be 5,182 from Chelsea. And the police, hampered by the ground\u2019s Airwave radio system not working, will be staying outside \u2013 although, they say, will enter if called on \u201cin an emergency or where crime and disorder occur\u201d \u2013 with \u201ctactical measures taken to meet operational communication requirements\u201c. In essence, though, what happens inside the ground on Wednesday is up to the stewards. They need to be organised. Any other measures in place? Plenty \u2013 including efforts to stop Chelsea fans buying seats in home sections by only selling to fans who have bought tickets in the last five years; attempts to improve segregation; and bans for fans involved in disorder this season. But there have been some mixed signals from the club, too. Co-owner David Sullivan says the problems have been overstated and most fans have been \u201cbehaving impeccably \u2026 I\u2019m increasingly fed up with negative campaigning against the stadium by some sections of the media\u201d. What are the home fans feeling about the game? Hard to be sure. \u201cSections of the media\u201d reported last week that lots have decided to skip it, describing \u201cthousands of cut-price seats unsold\u201d.

Related: Farming families confirm rival offer to Gina Rinehart's bid for S Kidman and Co    It is seeking to outgun a $365m bid by the Gina Rinehart-led joint venture company Australian Outback Beef (AOB), in which Hancock would own 67% of S Kidman and Co, with the Chinese-owned Shanghai Cred to hold the other third.  Buntine said if BBHO\u2019s bid for the company were successful, the S Kidman brand would continue, with its herd of 150,000 cattle jumping to more than 550,000, but some of the land would be split.  \u201cSome of the properties will be kept in this S Kidman and company, [with] those properties that are most strategic to go into the marketing and distribution business,\u201d Buntine told the ABC. \u201cBut the other properties which will be 80-90% of those properties will drop back into the individual syndicate families\u2019 individual companies.\u201d The Kidman company had previously indicated its preference was for the properties to stay in one parcel. Buntine said he did not consider the breakup of land between the four families to be a problem, given that they were Australian grazing families. The $386m BBHO offer also includes the Anna Creek station, which has an area up to 26,000 hectares adjacent to the Woomera weapons testing range.    Related: UK and US dwarf China as top foreign investors in Australian agricultural land    AOB\u2019s $365m bid does not include Anna Creek, which means the two bids are of similar value.  The offer by Rinehart-AOB secured it \u201cpreferred bidder\u201d status. It would require Foreign Investment Review Board approval, but it would represent a 1% lower foreign ownership than is now the case. In April the treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a majority Chinese-owned consortium because it could have been contrary to the \u201cnational interest\u201d. Kidman\u2019s assets comprise 101,411 sq km \u2013 2.5% of Australia\u2019s agricultural land or 1.3% of its land mass, stretching across Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.  Last week, when news of the BBHO bid broke, Hancock Prospecting\u2019s chief executive, Garry Korte, said the 18-month sales process had been extensive and exhausting. \u201cIt is a pity that one party chose not to meet those minimum requirements and is now seeking political favours to change the rules after the siren has sounded,\u201d Korte said.  But Buntine, who held a press conference in parliament last week, said BBHO was not asking for \u201cpolitical favours\u201d.  \u201cWe hope that there is more money on the table and there is a lower execution risk, we hope that will give us the win on this,\u201d Buntine said. A spokesman for S Kidman and Co confirmed the BBHO bid had been received but would not discuss the details of any bids. \u201cAs we have already indicated, Kidman\u2019s status as a public unlisted company with more than 50 shareholders means that under-bidders or parties not directly participating in the sale process still have an opportunity to submit a takeover offer,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cAt any time throughout the process until the takeover offer closes, parties can submit a superior counter-proposal for acquisition of the company.\u201d The spokeswoman said if a superior counter-proposal were received, it would be assessed by the Kidman board. Under its agreement with Kidman, AOB has the right to match the bid.     There isn\u2019t a level playing field if you are 100% Australian consortium that is putting up a credible alternative bid  Nick Xenophon     \u201cIf it is judged to be a superior proposal, and AOB do not exercise their matching right under the bid implementation agreement, directors have a duty to put that superior proposal to shareholders,\u201d the spokeswoman said. S Kidman and Co, founded in 1899 by Sir Sidney Kidman, remains Australia\u2019s largest private landholder. The company operates 10 cattle stations, a bull breeding stud farm and a feedlot.  Given that 98% of the land is held under pastoral lease, the bid would require state government approval for the transfer of leases to the new owners. BBHO has submitted its bid for 100% of the Kidman shares and is conditional on acquiring at least 90% of shares.  Nick Xenophon said there was a fundamental flaw in the Foreign Investment Review Board laws, which were blind to any local bids which might be on \u201cequivalent terms\u201d.   Xenophon said the BBHO bid was unconditional and in excess of the ABO bid \u201cso you would think it was in the box seat\u201d.  He added: \u201cThe concern here is that the Foreign Investment Review Board could wave the Rinehart-Shanghai bid through despite that there is a credible alternative bid that is 100% Australian.

The reputations of Asian universities, and Chinese universities in particular, are on the rise.

After two decades in which China has been largely an exporter of students to Australia, Canada, the US and the UK, it is now increasingly attracting international students to study at its universities. And what is true of China is true of other countries too. Global flows of students are an increasing feature of the world\u2019s higher education systems.

In recent years, students have been encouraged to enrol in four AS-levels in their first year in sixth form, then to abandon their weakest subject in their second and pursue their three best to A2-level.   Related: 'It's a crying shame': teachers on scrapped A-level subjects    But a survey by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) found that just 10% of colleges are planning to offer the traditional four subjects in lower sixth and three in upper from September 2017. The rest will offer three A-levels as standard in both years, with only the higher-achieving students considered for four, raising concerns that the curriculum will become narrow for the majority of pupils. The cut in A-levels is part of a wider picture of cutbacks in the sixth-form sector, which has been particularly hard hit by funding constraints in recent years. The SFCA report, published on Thursday, also reveals that two-thirds of sixth-form colleges have had to drop courses to reduce expenditure. Over a third of colleges (39%) have axed courses in modern foreign languages, including A-levels in German, French and Italian. And almost six out of 10 colleges (58%) have reduced extracurricular activities including educational visits, music, drama, Duke of Edinburgh award schemes and sport \u2013 or cut them altogether. Bill Watkin, SFCA chief executive, said: \u201cA combination of funding pressures and cost increases is forcing more and more colleges to offer only three subjects at A-level, instead of the established four. This narrowing of the post-16 learning experience is at odds with the government\u2019s principle of establishing a broad and balanced GCSE curriculum at 16. It is also out of step with what is happening in other high-performing education systems around the world.\u201d   Related: The Guardian view on A-level changes: loss of civilisation | Editorial    The government\u2019s decision to \u201cuncouple\u201d AS levels from A-levels, so that they no longer contribute to the final mark, has also played a part in the trend towards three A-levels throughout sixth form. Daveth Frost, principal of Holy Cross, a high-performing sixth-form college in Bury, Lancashire, said that of his 2,100 students, only few would now be allowed to study four A-levels in their first year \u2013 those who needed to in order to be considered for particular university courses.  \u201cOver the last two years, we\u2019ve been gradually bringing it down. Generally people are going to start with three now,\u201d he said. The risk is that students decide that they don\u2019t like one of their choices and drop from three to two, then have to find a speedy alternative for their final year. But the cut in the number of A-levels has saved Frost money and he has been able as a result to protect minority subjects \u2013 including German and dance \u2013 as well as extracurricular enrichment activities, which many other sixth forms have had to cut. Class sizes, however, have had to increase.   Related: Goodbye art history A-level, you served the elite well | Jonathan Jones    Since he started at Holy Cross eight years ago, Frost says he has seen a 20% decline in funding. Sixth-form pupils attract less funding than those in secondary school, and recently sixth forms have struggled with the same rise in pension and national insurance contributions as secondary schools. According to the SFCA funding impact survey, 84% of colleges are teaching students in larger class sizes, while nine out of 10 colleges are concerned about the financial health of their college, with just under a third (31%) reporting that it is likely their college will cease to be financially viable in the next three years. Bill Watkin said the report was a wake-up call to government. \u201cMore investment from government is essential if sixth-form colleges, school and academy sixth forms are to continue providing young people with the high-quality education they need to progress to higher education and employment.  \u201cA review of sixth-form funding is urgently required to ensure it is linked to the realistic costs of delivering a rounded, high-quality curriculum. Failure to do this risks turning sixth-form education into a narrow and part-time experience. That would be bad for students, bad for society and bad for the economy.\u201d The SFCA represents 90 sixth-form colleges in England, educating 160,000 16-18-year-olds who sit more than 20% of the A-levels taken in England each year. But the financial plight of stand-alone sixth form colleges is similarly evident in school sixth forms.   Related: When exams are part of a rigged system, financial rewards can work | Deborah Orr    Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe level of funding provided by the government is simply inadequate and the situation is dire.

We are already hearing of school sixth forms being closed and unless funding is increased, several further closures will follow.  \u201cThis is a critical time in the lives of young people which determines their higher education and career options and thus their life chances.

They are very quick to adopt and capitalise on new technologies. There are government policies in place, the private sector is moving quickly, there\u2019s evidence of a lot of technology uptake and the education systems are responding.\u201d Singapore is training a workforce ready to tackle technological innovation. Its students are among the world\u2019s top performers in science and maths, according to the 2012 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings, which tested 15-year-olds in more than 60 countries. Other high performers were Taiwan, Korea, Finland, Switzerland, and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China. Countries that are lagging behind, or could do better \u2013 such as Australia \u2013 are desperate to improve their performance in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects to fill what has become known as the STEM skills shortage. Those countries that perform well in STEM have several attributes in common, according to the Australian Council of Learned Academies, which reported to the Prime Minister\u2019s Science Engineering and Innovation Council on STEM country comparisons in 2013.  These include:  Highly esteemed, well-paid teachers Compulsory disciplinary content Reform to encourage more engaging, problem/inquiry-based learning, and critical and creative thinking Prestige attached to careers in science Strategic bipartisan national STEM policy frameworks Targets to motivate collaborative action  The US came up with just such a target in 2012, when it announced its aim to have one million additional college graduates with STEM degrees in 10 years in a bid to fill labour shortages.

Photograph: Chinnaphong Mungsiri/Getty Images    A cultural push Professor David Wilkinson, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Corporate Engagement and Advancement) at Macquarie University, points to Israel as an example of a country that is leading the way in terms of digital transformation. Israel is known \u201cthe Start-up Nation\u201d. With astonishing rates of R&amp;D expenditure, venture capital and start-ups per capita, and an extremely high proportion of scientists and engineers, Israel has become the nearest thing to Silicon Valley outside California. So much so that the Israeli tech scene is sometimes called Silicon Wadi (Hebrew for valley). In 2010 Israel raised 20 times more venture capital, per head of population, than Australia, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Multinationals including Intel, IBM and Microsoft are among almost 300 foreign companies to have R&amp;D centres in Israel, according to the City of Tel Aviv. And a country with a population of just 8.5 million has an estimated 3000 to 5000 start-ups and 300,000 people employed in high-tech industries. Long-standing strong government support for commercial R&amp;D has played a big role in Israel\u2019s ongoing tech innovation success. But there\u2019s also something about the Israeli character \u2013 chutpaz, perhaps \u2013 that helps people make the leap into start-ups, says Ben Lang, co-founder of the start-up community, Innovation Israel. \u201cThe culture plays a big part,\u201d Lang says. \u201cIt has a lot to do with the personality of the entrepreneurs. It\u2019s something very unique to the ecosystem here.\u201d The fact that everyone does national service also helps, Lang says. \u201cSo much of the start-up community is influenced by their service in the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces]. What unit they served in, people they know. Since everyone is required to serve in the army, that\u2019s where the networking and lots of learning occurs.\u201d But while some countries are obviously managing digital change better than others, Professor Wilkinson says innovation can be found all over the globe, sometimes in surprising areas. \u201cI have a deep personal interest in Africa, for example, and know of many hubs of innovation, incubation and digital disruption there,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. \u201cOf course many such settings don\u2019t have much depth and breadth, but once the change takes hold, it will spread.\u201d   Related: The age of collaboration    From the States to Spain Inspiration can be found everywhere. In the US, the Brookings Insitution, a non-profit public policy organisation, describes innovation districts as the \u201cultimate mash-up of entrepreneurs and educational institutions, start-ups and schools, mixed-use development and medical innovations, bike-sharing and bankable investments \u2013 all connected by transit, powered by clean energy, wired for digital technology, and fuelled by caffeine.\u201d Economic, physical, and networking assets combine with a supportive, risk-taking culture to create what Brookings calls an innovation ecosystem: \u201ca synergistic relationship between people, firms and place (the physical geography of the district) that facilitates idea generation and accelerates commercialisation.\u201d Brookings\u2019 work has helped inform Macquarie University\u2019s ongoing development of its own innovation district in Sydney\u2019s Macquarie Park. \u201cBrookings has characterised and codified the model beautifully,\u201d Professor Wilkinson says. He says the Brookings model or \u201cplaybook\u201d is clear, and can be adjusted for each setting. \u201cThere is also a very useful audit and evaluation framework,\u201d he says. \u201cI have visited many innovation districts and the key principles play out in each \u2013 but being sensitive to local needs is essential.\u201d Meanwhile, as the Spanish economy recovers from its years in the doldrums, the Barcelona start-up scene is an exciting place to be, says Scott Mackin, the American founder of Barcinno, a community-driven English-language platform that shares news of the local start-up scene as well as hosting events and workshops and helping inbound companies settle in the city. \u201cBarcelona is poised for exponential growth in the next five to 10 years.\u201d Mackin says. \u201cOn the whole, we\u2019re still a very young and immature start-up ecosystem, but that is rapidly changing\u2026 investors are coming in from all sides to get a piece of the action.\u201d As an English-language platform, Barcinno helps Spanish start-ups reach an international audience. Mackin describes it as \u201ca two-way bridge of talent, capital and information between Barcelona and the global business community\u201d. The Spanish Government has done a good job in supporting entrepreneurship, City Hall has been active in branding Barcelona an \u201cinnovation capital\u201d, and the city has world-class business, polytechnic and research facilities, which together makes a potent combination, Mackin says.     The City Hall in Barcelona, a city in which the start-up scene is an exciting place to be Photograph: Oscar Valencoso    Where does Australia fit in? \u201cCould do better\u201d sums up Australia\u2019s report card at this stage of our digital transformation.    (In Australia) all happening and will happen more and more, whatever government does or does not do  Professor Wilkinson     Hajkowicz says Australia is lagging behind the rising economies of Asia, particularly in areas such as high-speed broadband connectivity and having a workforce qualified to take on the digital age. The Government acknowledged the need for action last December, when it launched the National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA), a $1.1 billion, four-year program to incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship, reward risk taking, and promote science, maths and computing in schools.  Launching the agenda, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull noted that Australia has some good things going for it: strong economic fundamentals; direct access to Asia; a global reputation for goods and services; and quality scientific research organisations.  But it also has obstacles: a low appetite for risk, which can make it hard for start-ups to attract capital; declining participation in science, maths and computing at high school; and a consistent ranking of last or second last among OECD countries for business research collaboration.  \u201cIncreasing collaboration between businesses, universities and the research sector is absolutely critical for our businesses to remain competitive,\u201d the Prime Minister said. Hajkowicz welcomed the initiative.  \u2018It\u2019s a really important agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cEssentially Australia has to make a transition in its economy from where we are now to a much more advanced hi-tech economy that is much better plugged in to the Asian economies around us.  \u201cThe NISA package is a key policy tool instrument to help us make this leap. But there is still a how-to factor to building an innovative economy that we haven\u2019t resolved. We don\u2019t really know how to do it.  \u201cDo we just build infrastructure and hope they will all come? Or do we pick winners and choose industries?

Henrik Stenson and Daniel Berger shared second, the Open champion closing out with a 65. As Matsuyama celebrated his win, Rory McIlroy confirmed he has withdrawn from the Turkish Airlines Open this week. Amid fears over security McIlroy answered: \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious,\u201d when asked why he will not participate in Turkey. Player unrest over the safety of the event has been known for some time, with regular promises made over the levels of security that will be on hand at the Regnum Carya Resort near Antalya. Clearly McIlroy has not been suitably convinced. The Northern Irishman added on Sunday that he had \u201cslept much better\u201d since removing his name from the entry list. This marks both a blow to the event itself, which had earlier lost Tiger Woods for different reasons, and to the European Tour as it looks to promote its end-of-season final series. The field for Turkey is now notably weak. \u201cWe respect all decisions made by our members in relation to competing in tournaments,\u201d a European Tour spokesperson said. Speculation on Sunday surrounded the potential for further players to withdraw, with Patrick Reed among those thought to be considering their options. The Ladies European Tour cancelled a tournament in Turkey in June and that was still a live option for the men\u2019s equivalent, which has a $7m prize fund, as recently as the end of last week. McIlroy\u2019s core status aside, his move is even more striking as it could cost him the chance to defend successfully the European Tour\u2019s order of merit, the Race to Dubai. With three events of the season left \u2013 of which McIlroy will play only one \u2013 he lies behind Stenson and Danny Willett in the rankings. \u201cThe fact I\u2019ve won the FedEx Cup this year and won the Race to Dubai before made the decision a little easier,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s out of my hands. \u201cI took the decision not to go to Turkey next week. Those boys can battle it out. If I have somewhat of a chance going into Dubai, that\u2019s great. If not, they\u2019ve had big wins over the course of the season.

Typical in striking a pose, Byron was an aggressive Oxford aesthete of the \u201cBrideshead generation\u201d, a homosexual wanderer whose precocious career as a travel writer and art historian can be traced through a succession of prewar gems. (Robert Byron by James Knox, published by John Murray in 2003, remains the principal biographical source.) Byron wrote The Station, aged 22, after a visit to Mount Athos on a mule, Fortnum &amp; Mason saddlebags bursting with a soda siphon and chicken in aspic. This was followed by The Byzantine Achievement (1929) and The Birth of Western Painting (1930). In 1933, the publication of First Russia, Then Tibet confirmed Byron\u2019s reputation as a traveller and connoisseur. In the same year, accompanied by his friend Christopher Sykes, but tormented by his unrequited love for Desmond Parsons, Byron set out on a journey to Persia and Afghanistan, by way of Jerusalem, Damascus and Baghdad, in search of the origins of Islamic architecture. After many vicissitudes, The Road to Oxiana (the remote northern borderland of Afghanistan) became the record of his 11-month journey, a fabulous and intoxicating weave of surreal vignettes, journal entries and odd playlets. In these gorgeous pages, poetry, gossip and scholarship become braided into an exotic tapestry that dazzles as much today as it did on publication. As many critics have noted, unlike his contemporaries, such as Peter Fleming and Norman Douglas, Byron has not dated. An enthusiastic literary critical response ranged from Graham Greene, who admired Byron\u2019s demotic, conversational brilliance, to the rivalrous Evelyn Waugh, who had to concede the book\u2019s high spirits, via the Sunday Times, which linked Byron to his namesake (no relation) and declared him \u201cthe last and finest fruit of the insolent humanism of the 18th century\u201d. Today, widely considered to be Byron\u2019s masterpiece, The Road to Oxiana stands as perhaps the greatest travel book of the 20th century.    His best passages are strikingly joyous and carefree, in prose that\u2019s lambent, simple and brilliantly observed    It\u2019s a title that continues to inspire hyberbole. The American critic Paul Fussell, writing in Abroad, his important 1982 study of interwar literary travelling, has judged that \u201cwhat Ulysses is to the novel between the wars, and what The Waste Land is to poetry, The Road to Oxiana is to the travel book\u201d. This extravagant claim is supported by writers as varied as Bruce Chatwin, Colin Thubron and William Dalrymple. In their different ways, each shares a veneration for The Road to Oxiana. Chatwin, whose debt to Byron was profound, declared it to be \u201ca sacred text\u201d, and campaigned to get the book back into print with Picador in 1981, after almost 50 years of obscurity. Byron starts his quest, in medias res, with himself as a \u201cjoy-hog\u201d in Venice, immersed in the sea at Lido. The bathing, on a calm day, must be the worst in Europe: water like hot saliva, cigar ends floating into one\u2019s mouth, and shoals of jellyfish. Once he is joined by Christopher Sykes, Byron begins to hit his stride as as an aphorist: \u201cThe King David hotel is the only good hotel in Asia this side of Shanghai.\u201d Lines such as these will remind Byron\u2019s readers that when, on a visit to Soviet Russia, he had encountered an Intouristguide, a Shakespeare-denier who insisted that the plays could never have been written by a grocer from Stratford, Byron had cheerfully replied: \u201cThey are exactly the sort of plays I would expect a grocer to write.\u201d In the same spirit, Byron was untroubled by the perils of his trip. Crossing into Persia, his companion Sykes nervously rebukes him for disrespecting the shah out loud. He suggests: \u201cCall him Mr Smith.\u201d   Related: Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter    \u201cI always call Mussolini Mr Smith in Italy.\u201d \u201cWell, Mr Brown.\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s Stalin\u2019s name in Russia.\u201d Further debate establishes that \u201cJones\u201d is no good either. That\u2019s what Byron calls Hitler in Germany. (In 1938, together with Unity Mitford, Byron would attend the last Nuremberg rally.) Eventually, the two travellers settle on \u201cMarjoribanks\u201d for the shah (\u201cMarjoribanks\u201d will recur throughout the subsequent pages of Byron\u2019s journey). Quotation from Byron hardly begins to do justice to the pleasures of his writing. The Wildean mix of scholarship and irreverence becomes addictive, as in this typical passage about the Lutfullah mosque from Byron\u2019s visit to Isfahan: \u201cI have never encountered splendour of this kind before. Other interiors came into my mind as I stood there, to compare it with: Versailles, or the porcelain rooms at Sch\u00f6nbrunn, or the Doge\u2019s palace, or St Peter\u2019s\u2026 . All are rich; but none so rich. Their richness is three-dimensional; it is attended by all the effort of shadow: in the mosque of Sheikh Lutfullah, it is a richness of light and surface, of pattern and colour only. The architectural form is unimportant. It is not smothered, as in rococo; it is simply the instrument of a spectacle, as earth is the instrument of a garden.\u201d Byron was often as daring as he was witty. To enter the forbidden mosque of Goharshad, he disguised himself by blackening his face with charcoal. From Herat to Mazar-i-Sharif, he and Sykes were the first Englishmen to undertake what was, and remains, a highly dangerous route. Byron was insouciant towards the risks he took. Many of his best passages are strikingly joyous and carefree, in prose that\u2019s lambent, simple and brilliantly observed, as in this conclusion to a sunset at the shrine of Niamatullah: \u201cWhile the cadent sun throws lurid copper streaks across the sand-blown sky, all the birds in Persia have gathered for a last chorus. Slowly, the darkness brings silence, and they settle themselves to sleep with diminishing flutterings, as of a child arranging its bedclothes.\u201d   Related: Jan Morris at 90: she has shown us the world    Byron\u2019s grand journey plans were frustrated. He would never get further east than Afghanistan. The dividend, for his readers, is that he plunges himself into his Afghan adventures with infectious brio: in April, he\u2019s arrested for an \u201cincident\u201d; in May, we find him as a guest at the consul\u2019s ball; various kinds of transport break down or fail. Somehow, and very entertainingly, Byron ends up in Kabul. \u201cA winding hill road brought us down from the Charikar plateau to a smaller plain inside a ring of mountains; running water and corrugated iron glinted among its trees. At the entrance to the capital the police deprived the vicar and the curate of their rifles, to their great distress; but being in turbans, no one would believe they were government servants.\u201d There were still a few bizarre, comic encounters to record: \u201cThis morning at the Legation I met a Colonel Porter, who asked what my share in the world\u2019s work was. I said I had been looking at Mohammadan architecture. \u2018Mind you,\u2019 he replied. \u2018I can tell you the key to the problem, if you like.\u2019 \u2018Really. What is it?\u2019 \u2018The whole thing\u2019s phallic,\u2019 he uttered in a ghoulish whisper. I was surprised at first to note the influence of Freud on the north-west frontier, but soon discovered that for Colonel Porter the universe itself was phallic.\u201d After the thrills of Kabul and the Khyber Pass, England looked \u2013 as it always looks upon that inevitable return home \u2013 \u201cdrab and ugly from the train\u201d. Suddenly deflated, Byron confesses to feeling \u201cdazed at the prospect of coming to a stop, at the impending collision between 11 months\u2019 momentum and the immobility of a beloved home\u201d. Laconic, he writes: \u201cThe collision happened. Our dogs ran up. And then my mother \u2013 to whom, now it is finished, I deliver the whole record.\u201d Finally, Byron\u2019s journey of heart and mind reverts, poignantly, to its source, where no artifice or extravagance will seduce that all-consuming first reader. \u201cWhat I have seen she taught me to see,\u201d he writes, \u201cand will tell me if I have honoured it.\u201d Byron was lost at sea on 24 February 1941, aged 35, when the Egypt-bound ship on which he was sailing was torpedoed by a German U-boat off Cape Wrath. A signature sentence \u201cBelow the gleaming silver crags and stunted green-feathered pines, the mountain fell 3,000 feet to the coastal plain, an endless panorama of rusty red speckled with myriads of little trees and their shadows, beyond which, 60 miles away across the blue sea, appeared the line of Asia Minor and the Taurus Mountains.\u201d Three to compare Eric Newby: A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush (1958)Bruce Chatwin: In Patagonia (1977)Rory Stewart: The Places in Between (2004) The Road to Oxiana is published by Vintage (\u00a38.99).

The theatre was also doubling its audience and winning awards. George, who has died aged 87, was one of the postwar generation of British directors who moved theatre on from fortnightly rep in \u201cthe provinces\u201d to more adventurous productions that could compete with television drama and the West End stage. A quietly spiritual man \u2013 he became a Quaker \u2013 he was also a theatre visionary, founding the Crucible\u2019s education and community company, Theatre Vanguard. It made Sheffield only the second rep in the UK to produce work for schools and young people. George was born in Pembroke Dock, south-west Wales, the son of Edward George, a Congregational minister, and his wife, Helen (nee Sandercock). He attended Caterham school in Surrey, and after national service studied English at University College, Oxford, where he was heavily involved with the Oxford University Dramatic Society. On graduating, with Peter Hall, John Barton, Paul Almond and Toby Robertson in 1952 he formed the Oxford and Cambridge Players, which became the Elizabethan Theatre Company. Its Henry V, in which he took the title role, was televised.     Colin George in Othello.    He joined Birmingham Rep as an actor in 1956 before going in 1958 to the old Nottingham Playhouse as associate director \u2013 a move influenced by fears that a troublesome lung might not stand up to an acting career. There, in 1964, he directed Alastair Sim as Shylock and Gemma Jones as Portia, and the theatre\u2019s artistic director, John Neville, in Sophocles\u2019s Oedipus the King. Steeped in the classics, he would direct Oedipus again in a memorable Sheffield production using masks; a \u201cfascist\u201d Macbeth followed in 1970 with Nigel Hawthorne establishing himself as much more than a light comedian. George took over from Geoffrey Ost as artistic director of Sheffield Playhouse in 1965, and introduced the city\u2019s audiences to Harold Pinter, Bertholt Brecht, John Osborne and John Arden. While these writers did not fill the 560-seater converted temperance hall, the play about the \u201cSheffield outrages\u201d \u2013 murderous attacks on exploitative non-union employers a century before that led to the first trade union regulation \u2013 which he commissioned from the actor Alan Cullen most certainly did. Called The Stirrings in Sheffield on Saturday Night, and with music by Rod Horn using traditional material, the play entered the city\u2019s bloodstream and there are hundreds of Sheffielders today who can still make a fair stab at To Be a Sheffield Grinder, the show\u2019s hit song. The production featured Dorothy Vernon, a former Sheffield teacher turned actor, whom George married in 1967. In 1966, much to his astonishment, the city\u2019s Labour council asked George where he wanted his new theatre. The Playhouse was to be demolished to make way for a ring road. A site was found, within a stone\u2019s throw of the old Edwardian Lyceum theatre. A proscenium arch with a large forestage was planned for the new building. But in October 1967 the director Tyrone Guthrie visited Sheffield to give a talk. Something of a maverick, he had discovered the \u201cthrust\u201d configuration in Edinburgh when, working with Laurence Olivier, a production had to be moved into a hall with seats arranged on three sides.     Colin George in rehearsal. Photograph: Crucible Theatre    He persuaded George to visit the US and Canada and look at the thrust stages in Stratford, Ontario, and Minneapolis. Henry V, and the prologue\u2019s speech asking the actor to \u201cascend the brightest heaven of invention\u201d came into George\u2019s head as he walked up the tunnel to the stage of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. It was a road-to-Damascus moment. The 1,000-seater Crucible opened in November 1971 with Fanfare, a compilation show featuring Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge in Chekhov, a brass band and Sheffield children singing Consider Yourself from Oliver!. All well and good but not yet the real thing.Guthrie died before he could direct the first play, Aeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon. George staged Peer Gynt instead, but the energy needed to get the theatre built had taken its toll. With many theatregoers already sceptical about the thrust stage, this was not the moment for a somewhat underpowered Ibsen and an even less well-known play, in Thomas Dekker\u2019s The Shoemaker\u2019s Holiday. But when he revived Stirrings in 1973 things looked up. He left Sheffield on a high a year later with Calamity Jane, featuring Lynda Marchal \u2013 now better known as the writer Lynda la Plante \u2013 as a wonderfully feisty and funny lead. George worked in turn at the State Theatre Company of South Australia and then the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, where he was dean for 11 years. In Australia, he gave Mel Gibson and Judy Davis their first stage roles as the leads in Romeo and Juliet, and from Hong Kong he toured a Chinese production of Euripides\u2019 The Bacchae to Shanghai and Beijing. Returning to Britain he devised his own one-man-show in the person of Shakespeare\u2019s father and in 1994 joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. In the company was Daniel Evans, who later became artistic director of the Crucible. In 2011, in the theatre\u2019s 40th anniversary production of Othello with Dominic West and Clarke Peters, Evans invited George back to play Desdemona\u2019s aged father. It was George\u2019s last role, in a theatre he loved and which was now garlanded with awards. And it was a full house. George\u2019s first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Sue Spanner, whom he married in 1992, by the four children, Gwendolyn, Caroline, Lucy and Edward, of his first marriage, and by 14 grandchildren. \u2022 Colin George, actor and director, born 20 September 1929; died 15 October 2016", "tags": ["Theatre", "Sheffield", "Stage", "Wales", "University of Oxford", "Hong Kong", "Australia news", "Royal Shakespeare Company"], "publicationDate": "2016-10-31T17:37:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/01/novak-djokovic-andy-murray-paris-masters", "sentences": ["But now I\u2019m interested in learning about how the brain works, rather than being told how to count to 10, or whatever it is, to calm yourself down \u2013 which, for me, didn\u2019t help.\u201d   Related: Novak Djokovic loses cool and Shanghai semi-final against Roberto Bautista Agut    Now, in a not altogether surprising development for those who know him, Djokovic, the king of gluten-free eating and devotee of experimental training methods, has turned to a Spaniard who once earned a meagre living from tennis but latterly is a life coach who preaches \u201camor y paz\u201d \u2013 love and peace \u2013 to unlock the inner self."], "title": "Novak Djokovic turns to love and peace in a bid to end Andy Murray\u2019s dream | Kevin Mitchell", "article": "Rarely have the strengths and frailties of modern athletes been so cruelly exposed as in the major tennis stadiums of the world over the past decade or so.

If Murray wins the Paris Masters final and Djokovic does not get out of the semi-finals, the prize will swing from Belgrade to Dunblane, an achievement before the ATP World Tour Finals in London this month that should all but ensure the Scot a knighthood in the New Year honours list. Murray has had the season of his life. He won Wimbledon and the Olympics for the second time and, after running on empty in the Davis Cup semi-finals, went on an-end-of-season rampage in Asia and Europe that should also secure him a third BBC Sports Personality of the Year award. His self-belief can never have been higher.   Related: Andy Murray closes on world No1 Novak Djokovic with Vienna title    But can Murray hold his nerve?

Has he got the mental as well as the physical fortitude to hold at bay an opponent who, although suffering a rare dip in form and confidence since his early exit at Wimbledon, has beaten him 24 times out of 34? In the early days of their rivalry, the examination of wills was predominantly physical rather than cerebral, battles of endurance rarely embroidered by the nuances of the sport. However, since Djokovic rose alongside Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to dominate the game, and Murray broke through to join him in an engaging quartet, that battle is now mental, too. Djokovic more than once has infuriated Murray in big finals with what the long-time world No2 has hinted were mind games, seeming to fake a collapse then recovering to blitz him at the finish. It appeared to spook Murray to distraction and, before last year\u2019s Wimbledon, he admitted he had been to see a psychiatrist, not for treatment but for enlightenment. \u201cI used a lot of sports psychologists when I was younger,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cSometimes it helped and sometimes it didn\u2019t feel like it did.

Novak Djokovic preaches importance of love and harmony \u2013 video    A two-hour video of a session involving Djokovic, his spiritual guru, Pepe Imaz, and others in front of a spellbound audience, first revealed in the Daily Mail on Tuesday, is the talk of tennis. While it sometimes takes on the mood of a s\u00e9ance, it ought not be ridiculed as a comic turn; just as Murray and others have sought help away from the court (Murray keeping notes courtside in his kitbag), so Djokovic, who admits to \u201coff-court issues\u201d, is looking for a light in his life. It might well bring him the sort of perspective that marriage and fatherhood have delivered to Murray. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are in sports,\u201d Djokovic tells the gathering. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter in which profession you are in life. Essentially we are all the same.\u201d That is not a sentiment likely to be shared by any of the 59 players he has beaten in 66 matches this year. But Djokovic\u2019s life mission seems more profound now, going beyond mere sport. It is a voyage that will either dilute his ambitions or bring him such peace he becomes even more formidable than he has been in winning 12 majors, two of them this year, both at Murray\u2019s expense. For all that modern players ooze physical strength, mentally they are riding a wild wave. The less confident among them \u2013 such as Tomas Berdych, who clings to a slim hope of getting to Greenwich \u2013 tend to crash spectacularly now and again, as the 6ft 5in Czech did not do here on Tuesday, when he beat the frustratingly unfulfilled Portuguese Joao Sousa 6-3, 3-6, 7-5. It was an enthralling fight that took just under two hours. This is Berdych\u2019s first week outside the world\u2019s top 10 in six years, uncomfortable territory for someone who has not always made the most of his gifts, but, in the parallel rankings for the Greenwich finale, he is just behind Dominic Thiem and Marin Cilic.

In wins of vastly contrasting style and rhythm here on Wednesday the two best players in the world went through to the third round of the Paris Masters, but it is the Serb who will feel more energised and confident. Murray went to the limit of his resources to beat Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-7, 7-5 in 2hr 28min to set up what may be an equally difficult match against Lucas Pouille.

He now plays Grigor Dimitrov, who rarely troubles him.   Related: Johanna Konta returns to form by beating Sam Stosur in WTA Elite Trophy    In Djokovic\u2019s absence from the Tour Murray was racking up win after win to move tantalisingly close to him in the ATP rankings; he would displace Djokovic as world No1 if he won the final and Djokovic were to fall in the semis. That scenario is now very much up in the air. Gilles Simon, who beat Agut in three sets on Wednesday, disagrees, even though he struggled to stay on level terms with Murray in Shanghai and last week in Vienna. \u201cI think it is possible for him to become world No1 but I sense he is a bit tired \u2013 not so much on his level of play or physically,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is showing signs of tension.\u201d Murray has a most welcome ally in his former coach, Amelie Mauresmo. \u201cI\u2019m happy for him,\u201d said the Frenchwoman, who split with Murray in the spring. \u201cHe\u2019s been second for a long time, so if he\u2019s not first at the end of the year, I hope it\u2019ll be next year. It would be deserved. He\u2019s one of the most gifted player of his generation, he\u2019s a huge worker, Physically, he\u2019s a rock.\u201d He needed to be. Murray, exhausted and relieved, said courtside: \u201cIt was tough. He was going for his shots, serving huge. When he was behind and even when I was getting the return back, there often wasn\u2019t enough on it. He was hitting a lot of winners, taking a lot of risks, hitting a few lines. I fought hard enough to get the win. \u201c[The Pouille match] will be kind of similar to today, although he\u2019s a right-hander and is improving all the time. He will have home support which might help him, but I have enjoyed playing here in this atmosphere.\u201d It did not always seem that way. Murray did well \u2013 as he has done so often \u2013 to overcome his opponent and, briefly, the crowd, who booed him near the end when they judged his yell of \u201ccome on\u201d to have unfairly put Verdasco off. Murray broke for 5-3, served out the first set in 36 minutes and it was looking like another easy assignment against a 32-year-old opponent he had beaten 11 times out of 12 and who was languishing 44 places below him in the world rankings. However, when Murray had to save two break points at the start of the second and then failed to handle the Spaniard\u2019s sharp change of direction to fall behind 1-3, there was insurrection in the air. It was classically perverse Murray, who always digs plenty of holes for himself. For the next hour or so Verdasco played some of the best tennis of his long career, threatening to embarrass the world No2, who he almost put out of Wimbledon in the quarter-finals in 2013, the year Murray went on to beat Djokovic in the final. Murray broke back for 4-5 and by the time they got to the tie-break, he had regained some of his composure; but he buried a backhand at 5-6 and they went to a deciding set. Murray saved two break points in the 10th game for 5-5, held serve, just, and broke to love when he forced a final overcooked forehand out of his formidable foe. He will have diminished support against Pouille, who slid 21 aces past Feliciano L\u00f3pez and was gifted the result, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, when the Spaniard double-faulted on match point after two hours of a very tight contest. Djokovic returned from his enforced sabbatical admitting: \u201cThe last couple of months were not easy. Mentally, I\u2019ve had to redefine my goals and things that are happening on and off the court, and just make sure that I\u2019m in a good place.\u201d   Related: Novak Djokovic turns to love and peace in a bid to end Andy Murray\u2019s dream | Kevin Mitchell    Rarely can the words \u201coff the court\u201d have been more loaded. Physically, he seems fine again but the extent of his efforts to repair his bruised spirit surfaced this week.

After his routine win Djokovic was handing out little love to those he reckoned were unfairly depicting Imaz as a weird guru. Djokovic, in stark contrast to Murray\u2019s struggle, played well within himself to overcome the artful challenge of M\u00fcller, acing the Luxembourg veteran for the second time in the match to win 6-3, 6-4. There are as many locker-room opinions about Murray\u2019s chances of overtaking Djokovic as there are among commentators on the US presidential puzzle. A lot of players and former Tour veterans think he can do it, including Roberto Bautista Agut, who reached his first Masters final in Shanghai only to meet Murray at his most obdurate.

The CEAPA (which represents 12,000 parent/teacher organisations) is organising protests against what it claims is too much homework set by schools. A recent survey revealed that 82% of parents asked believed it was too much or excessive. Over half thought it harmed family life. And with a few caveats, I couldn\u2019t agree more with their complaint. Interestingly, compared with other countries, the estudiantes have it relatively easy. In 2014, the OECD recorded average weekly homework assigned to 15-year-old students across various countries, and it turns out Spanish students don\u2019t know how lucky they are, with a mere 6.5 hours. Finnish pupils dodge the bullet with a skinny 2.8 hours. Shanghai clobbers its students with 13.8 hours (so they know what it feels like to be a teacher, I imagine). The UK doles out a comparatively palatable 4.9 hours.

Related: Theresa May\u2019s grammar school nostalgia is heartfelt - but wrong | Jonathan Freedland    So what does the research say about it? A 2001 meta-study by the National Foundation for Educational Research concluded that there was \u201ca positive relationship between time spent and outcomes at secondary level\u201d but \u201cevidence at primary level is inconsistent\u201d. And even at secondary, homework \u201cexplains only a small amount of variance in pupils\u2019 achievement\u201d. More recently John Hattie\u2019s seminal Visible Learning study concluded that homework overall had an effect size of 0.29 \u2013 in other words, a very small impact. He too noted a difference between the effect on young pupils (0.15, minuscule) and older children (0.64, significant). Other studies concur. So if there is at least some utility, are the Spanish parents right to rebel? Si. Because there is a huge variance between the effect different types of homework have on students. And homework differs from classwork in many ways. It\u2019s normally done independently of supervision; it requires that the task is understood, and that all resources to complete the task (from IT to prior, understood knowledge) are availableThe student needs uninterrupted time and space to finish it, and the qualities of character to complete it. Obviously, mileage varies enormously in all of these categories. In a classroom you can attempt to create a controlled environment where conditions are optimised for everyone\u2019s benefit. But setting homework is an act of faith about what will return; a boomerang thrown into the darkness.     Homework by candlelight in San Cristobal, Venezuela. Photograph: Carlos Eduardo Ramirez/Reuters    Plus, some homework is useful, and some is not. One thing that amazed me when I entered teaching was how much homework appeared to be entirely mad, and set for little purpose beyond bureaucracy. Writing a poem about how you felt about litter was one of my favourites, but there were countless other examples. Writing a letter from Jesus about what it was like to be on the cross. Making \u201cwanted\u201d posters for Mr Hyde for English teachers. Colouring in the Great Fire of London for history. Writing scripts for roleplays about Greek medicine. Building volcanoes out of papier mache for geography. I mean, come on. These kind of activities indicate a purposelessness that we need to say goodbye to for ever in teaching. Set meaningful homework, or not at all. It\u2019s their time you\u2019re wasting. For example, asking pupils to read independently is great, and useful at most ages, although by itself it won\u2019t help someone struggling with the basics. It demonstrates what is called the Matthew effect: to those that already have, shall be given. In other words it\u2019s the children with poor background knowledge or difficult home environments who benefit least from it, and the most fortunate who get any effect at all. Which isn\u2019t an argument against homework, but a reminder that when you set it, you have to be aware of the different impacts it can have.   Related: 'My son works until midnight': parents around the world on homework    Of course the teacher\u2019s lens is important here too: homework produces marking. And if you set it, the student deserves constructive feedback. But if you see 200+ children as a secondary humanities teacher every week, weekly marking becomes a Sisyphean task. Even flicking and ticking the toils of that number of pupils becomes an extra day out of your week. And the effect of such minimal feedback is microscopic at best. Given that this might burn anything up to 25% of your notional working life, it\u2019s heart-breaking, not to mention pointless. Finally, the parents\u2019 view: homework steals family time that doesn\u2019t get refunded elsewhere in the week. And that is indisputably true, and the theft is compounded when the return is so small in general. Those few hours between getting home and closing your eyes are precious to the inter-family relationship. If you\u2019re going to steal any of that, you better be damn sure that the reward is greater than the loss. And for a lot of homework, for a lot of children, it just doesn\u2019t add up.

Dick Clark Productions is the Chinese conglomerate\u2019s first foray into television, according to the Wanda Group, which noted the firm\u2019s ownership of the Golden Globes, the American Music Awards and the eponymous New Year\u2019s countdown event. The company had fallen from its prominence in decades past, however, when Clark hosted variety shows, such as American Bandstand, to consistently strong ratings. Industry sources told Variety magazine they were surprised by the deal, with two people calling the $1bn sale \u201cnonsensical\u201d and \u201cunreal\u201d. The Chinese firm said the American company\u2019s management \u201cwill remain in its entirety\u201d and that Wanda \u201chas signed a long-term operation target agreement with the management\u201d.

In October, representatives asked the justice department to review the company\u2019s potential ties to senior members of China\u2019s communist party.  Wang has called himself an \u201cangel\u201d investor in struggling US entertainment companies, and said that his pursuit of American companies will help them profit in the huge Chinese market. He has also said that he hopes the group will control 20% of the world\u2019s movie theater seats by 2020, up from the 13% it currently owns in China, the US and Europe, after recent purchases of Odeon and UCI Cinemas.

It will make us better and stronger in managing the process of building and retaining playing talent at all age groups. Development is so important and it makes sense to have a position, within the football structure specifically, that focuses on where we can improve. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret I like the concept of a sporting director and having worked under this model previously I have found it to be nothing but positive and forward thinking. Michael is absolutely the right person for this. He has the knowledge, expertise and personality to flourish in the role and I was delighted when he told me he would be accepting the position. Importantly, he also has a fantastic team of people around him, who have all played a significant role in putting together the talent we currently have in the first team, development squad and at even younger age levels.\u201d Klopp confirmed the new management structure would not change his influence on transfers and that he would retain the final say on signings. He said: \u201cIf somebody is not happy with whatever and you ask: \u2018Is that your player or his player?\u2019 It\u2019s always my player. I can\u2019t blame anyone for anything. I can take the pressure. In this business, the manager is not allowed to be a one-man show. I\u2019m a specialist in football things, I know a lot, but not everything like finances.

Murray, enjoying the season of his life, beat Tomas Berdych 7-6 (11-9), 7-5 in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters and will replace Djokovic as world No1 if wins his semi-final on Saturday against Milos Raonic. That would erase the 235 points between himself and the Serb and move him past the man who has been his master for most of their parallel careers \u2013 but who earlier succumbed to the world No10, Marin Cilic, for the first time in 15 encounters over eight years.   Related: Novak Djokovic\u2019s defeat by Cilic opens door for Andy Murray to be world No1    The Croatian\u2019s 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) win in an hour and 44 minutes stunned a struggling Djokovic, who saved two match points despite nursing an injury to his right arm that has troubled him for months, and handed Murray the chance he has worked so hard for, not just the past month or so while collecting titles in Beijing, Shanghai and Vienna but for much of his 11 years on the Tour. Murray said: \u201cMaybe there were a few more nerves before but, once I got out there, no. It was a great atmosphere. It didn\u2019t really bother me. I don\u2019t know [how he will handle the pressure on Saturday]. I\u2019ve never been in this position before. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll deal with it. Normally in big matches, when you got on court, you feel fine. If I wasn\u2019t to get to No1 this year, I was looking to next year. If it happens, great. It\u2019s been a great few months for me and I\u2019ll try to finish this week the best I can.\u201d \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t my goal at the start of the week. It wasn\u2019t my goal two or three weeks ago. This is a long-term thing. To get to No1 is not about one match. It\u2019s about a whole season that you put together and 12 months of work. If it doesn\u2019t happen tomorrow, it can still happen in a few months. That is when I [originally] thought I\u2019d have a better chance of doing it. But I\u2019m not putting any extra pressure on myself.\u201d He also paid tribute to the incumbent. \u201cHe\u2019s not just the No1 player just now. He\u2019s one of the best players that\u2019s ever played \u2013 just like Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal] have been, as well.\u201d He said of a dramatic first-set tie-break against Berdych: \u201cI played some good ones, he played some bad ones on the set points, and I just fought as hard as I could. I served pretty well in those moments, better than him. There were a few net cords that went my way. I dealt with the double-fault well. It didn\u2019t affect me.\u201d His win was littered with the usual sprinkling of magic and angst over nearly two hours on Court Central. In a tie-break that will make any highlights reel of the season Murray came from 6-1 down, saved seven set points, double-faulted with the most horrendous second serve for 8-9, watched a nailed-on Berdych winner drift long after banging the tape and allowed himself a huge, puffed-cheek gasp of relief when a double-fault give him set point at 10-9, on serve. After a shootout that lasted a quarter of an hour Murray put away an angled forehand to leave the Czech rooted to the baseline. Having constructed a mental mountain for himself after a first set of the highest quality, Berdych, not always the most resilient of players, dropped serve at the start of the second. But, steeling himself to the task, he broke back when Murray, serving for the match at 5-4, thrashed a forehand into the net. The Czech, who had gone for his shots all night, could not sustain the fightback, however, belting his sixth double fault. At the second attempt Murray had a match-winning serve wrongly overruled at 40-15, battled to deuce and put it to bed with consecutive aces, his fourth and fifth of an excellent match. Defeat was doubly painful for Berdych as it put him out of contention for the eighth and final place in the ATP World Tour Finals that start in London on Monday week. Djokovic could not have been more gracious afterwards, acknowledging that Murray, whom he has beaten 24 times in 34 matches, would be a worthy successor as the game\u2019s best player. \u201cIf he gets it, which he is in a very good position to do, he\u2019s definitely a player who deserves that,\u201d Djokovic said, as Murray\u2019s match against Berdych was playing out on TV screens all around him. \u201cUndoubtedly much respect for what he has done. We have known each other since very early days. We were 11 years old when we first played against each other. And to see how he has raised his level in the last 12 months is quite extraordinary. All I can say is that he\u2019s deservedly in the position he\u2019s in at the moment.\u201d Djokovic, who had looked so solid as he completed a career grand slam at Roland Garros in the summer, has seen his game slowly fracture around the edges under pressure on and off the court. He was as honest as he ever has been in addressing his dilemma. There are growing rumours he may soon part company with one of his coaches, Boris Becker, and Djokovic did not provide any evidence to the contrary. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s early to talk about it but the team that\u2019s there is there. I\u2019ll see what\u2019s gonna happen for next year.\u201d As for his own game and ambitions, Djokovic was equally candid. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to feel [after finally winning the French Open, beating Murray in the final]. At a certain point I had to reach this kind of phase where I had to reflect and say: \u2018OK, I have played on the highest possible level for that much time.\u2019 The drop of form is normal in sports. I\u2019m not too concerned about how the future will go for me. I\u2019m just living in the moment and that\u2019s all.\u201d He added: \u201cIt would be disrespectful to all the players that I only talk about myself or Andy, even though we are in two top spots in the world at the moment. There are guys like Marin Cilic, for example, or Stan Wawrinka who are right behind. They keep on pushing, keep on fighting. This is sport. You can\u2019t always expect to win. In terms of what the future brings to me, that\u2019s not in my hands. I\u2019m going to keep playing at this level as long as I feel like that\u2019s the right thing for me.\u201d But this is Murray\u2019s moment. If he gets to the top of the mountain, he will be the oldest player to do so since John Newcombe, then 30, in 1974, and would join the 25 illustrious players who have ruled since the ATP introduced the ranking system in 1973.

Especially at this stage of my career, as well \u2026 so it\u2019s more satisfying in some ways. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a difficult thing to do because of how good the guys ahead of me have been. Even this year, to even be there for one week and be 20 points ahead, or whatever, I have had to win so many matches and get to the latter stage of pretty much every tournament I have played. \u201cThey [Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal] are three of the best players that have ever played the game. Some of the years that they have had in that period have been ridiculous, really \u2013 three slams, double slams and many Masters series, as well. So it\u2019s taken a great year to get there.\u201d Murray said he spoke to his mother, Judy, and his wife, Kim, and the former British No1 Tim Henman, but had not had time to go through any other messages of congratulations. With another prized bauble to go alongside his three majors, the new world No1 will reach for one more title in the final on Sunday, against John Isner, who beat Cilic 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and 11 minutes \u2013 quite a turnaround for the Croat, who put Djokovic out of the tournament to provide Murray with a smooth path to the summit of his sport. It is fair to say a semi-final against a fit Raonic would have been tougher than will be the final against Isner, whom Murray has beaten in all of their seven matches. As Murray said, jokingly: \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is right in the rules but, if I get defaulted in the match tomorrow, I don\u2019t think I get the points from this week. So I need to make sure I\u2019m on my best behaviour, keep my racket in my hands, and all will be well on Monday.

Photograph: Michel Euler/AP    \u201cI need to reset what it is I\u2019m trying to achieve. Hopefully, I\u2019ll feel good for that. I had a similar experience last week in Vienna with [David] Ferrer withdrawing before the final.\u201d Murray said that Raonic told him \u2013 and totally by accident \u2013 about pulling out. \u201cI was in the locker room watching some videos of Milos\u2019s match yesterday when he came into the room where we were. I kind of, like, quickly closed the iPad. Then he told us he had hurt his quad and he wasn\u2019t going to be able to play. \u201cI felt quite calm, just because of the nature of how it happened. I didn\u2019t really react. My team were a bit different, gave me a hug and chatted about it.\u201d Whatever his sympathies for Raonic, Murray will take the break anyway it comes. \u201cI never expected to do what I had done after the French Open,\u201d he said, reflecting on his loss to Djokovic in the final. \u201cI was really down after I lost that match. But things can turn around quickly in sport. You had Novak losing yesterday to a guy he won 14 times in a row against. And then John beating Cilic today who he\u2019d lost six in a row against.\u201d Raonic, who lost to Murray in the final of Wimbledon this year, said: \u201cYesterday at 4-2 in the first set I started feeling some pain in my leg. This morning I had trouble waking up and getting out of bed. So I did some tests, an MRI. They found that I have a grade one tear in the right quad.\u201d    Congratulations @andy_murray for reaching the pinnacle of our sport- #1!!!

I still have the possibility of making it, but I was told five to 10 days. So I\u2019m on the borderline for that.\u201d If, as seems almost certain, Raonic does not make it to the starting line at the O2 in north Greenwich, Tomas Berdych, whom Murray beat on Friday, will join the final eight.

Unfortunately, this is football, land of the absurd, and it all fits into the narrative to learn that Coventry City, under the permanently bewildering Sisu regime, briefly discussed the idea \u2013 no kidding \u2013 of being the first club in England to introduce a \u201ctext\u2011a\u2011substitute\u201d option during matches. Supporters would be given a number they could text, at premium rates, to say who the manager should take off and who should come on. An announcement would be made at the appropriate time about the most popular vote and the manager, the poor patsy, would be under instructions to comply with the crowd\u2019s wishes.   Related: The London Stadium: an unloved venue resulting from expensive mistakes | Owen Gibson    To be fair, the idea did not get far, but it does you give you an example of the boardroom buffoonery that is prevalent within the sport and it did make me wonder whether the supporters of Southampton, experiencing the kind of joys the modern-day Coventry can scarcely imagine, ever contemplate how life might have been entirely different but for one of those Sliding Doors moments that has sent the two clubs in their respective directions. When the story of Southampton\u2019s success is told, it tends to be forgotten that Sisu, the hedge fund that has brought Coventry to their knees, was once on the brink of buying the south\u2011coast club and closing a deal that, 125 miles north, would have spared another club the distress it has endured over the last nine years. How close was it to happening? Very close. On 19 October 2007, the directors of Southampton Leisure Holdings, the club\u2019s parent company, voted 5-2 in favour of accepting the \u00a340m deal that Sisu had put forward. Everything was in place until the proposals were rejected by three of the major shareholders \u2013 Rupert Lowe, Michael Wilde and Leon Crouch \u2013 to spark a falling-out that eventually split the board in two. The announcement of Sisu taking control at Coventry came eight weeks later and within three days Southampton\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hone, the chairman, Ken Dulieu, and the commercial director, Andy Oldknow, had quit, blaming \u201ca major difference of opinion between them and certain major shareholders\u201d. Knowing what we do now, we can all probably agree which club made the wiser decision, and who was offering the best advice, even if Southampton did have to endure some prolonged pain, including a spell in administration and relegation to League One, before Markus Liebherr\u2019s 2009 takeover began the recovery we see now. Dulieu was so embedded to Sisu he turned up at Coventry proclaiming himself to be the man who would save the club and announcing he used to \u201clook after security operations in Northern Ireland\u201d. Orange Ken, as he became known because of his perma\u2011tan, became chairman, then head of football operations, and started attracting suspicion when he ordered himself a training kit bearing his own initials. He invited himself into the dressing room when the manager, Andy Thorn, was giving his team talk and watched one game from the dugout, apparently living out some childhood fantasies, before the stink it caused led to his resignation. He left Coventry in the Championship\u2019s relegation zone, proudly claiming to have \u201cturned the club around\u201d and, unless someone can tell me otherwise, he has not worked in football since. It is amazing the kind of people this sport attracts and, unfortunately for Coventry, they have suffered more than most when it comes to the list of those passing through with big ideas, little expertise and the general sense that they think running a football club must be a doddle. Another was Leonard Brody, a Canadian entrepreneur and social media guru, who joined Coventry at the same time as Dulieu, forming part of the club\u2019s \u201cbest-ever board\u201d and in one meeting announced he had a master-plan to stop the club haemorrhaging so much money. The details are recounted in A Club Without a Home, a splendid new book telling the story of the Sisu years in the words of Simon Gilbert, the Coventry Evening Telegraph\u2019s award-winning chief reporter. \u201cLeonard Brody said he had 10 ideas, so I said: \u2018What is your best idea?\u2019\u201d Gary Hoffman, the former vice-chairman, tells the author. \u201cThat was when he talked about \u2018text a substitute\u2019. I said even if that was allowed under Football League rules, how do you think that\u2019s going to transform the revenues of Coventry City?\u201d Another idea was to make a Sky Blue Rolls-Royce available for wedding hire. Then, at the end of the meeting, someone asked if there was any other business and Hoffman remembers Sisu\u2019s representative, Onye Igwe, raising his hand. \u201cOnye said: \u2018Yes, I want to raise the subject of our mascot.\u2019 The club was going bust and he said: \u2018I think Sky Blue Sam is too fat and it\u2019s not setting a good example for children.\u2019 That\u2019s when Ray Ranson [the former chairman] said: \u2018Onye, it\u2019s a fucking elephant.\u2019\u201d We are all probably aware of what has happened to Coventry since and why Southampton should thank their lucky stars that Sisu (who also expressed an interest in Derby County and looked at Manchester City before Thaksin Shinawatra\u2019s takeover) ended up somewhere else. On the one hand, there is a Southampton side that have just beaten Internazionale to show, again, why they should be regarded as the prime example of what can happen at a medium-sized club that applies common sense, a sound business structure, makes shrewd appointments and understands what a football team means to the local community. On the other hand, there is a desperate, grieving club where the supporters old enough to remember the crumbling terraces of tatty, homely Highfield Road must pine for more innocent times and the scandal runs so deep John Sillett, one of the great names from Coventry\u2019s past, has shed tears while talking about it publicly. Coventry have already suffered the indignity of a 68-mile round trip to Sixfields, Northampton Town\u2019s ground, to play their \u201chome\u201d matches and the really galling part is that however much the supporters protest, however many frothy column pieces are written, and whatever you or I might like to do about it, the owners still continue with the same cold detachment. The club have no stadium agreement beyond next season, the training ground could be sold off for housing and their academy is at risk of closure. Coventry look like they have been dragged through a hedge fund backwards and the scary thing is it might get even worse. The club, in Gilbert\u2019s opinion, face the \u201cvery real possibility of dropping out of the Football League completely in the coming years unless something dramatic happens to change their fortunes for the better\u201d. When we spoke on Friday it was the morning after Southampton had beaten Inter, six years to the week since the south-coast club faced Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in League One. \u201cMost supporters probably thought Coventry City had got one over on Southampton by attracting Sisu,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cIn reality, Southampton dodged a bullet.\u201d It all feels incredibly sad and unsatisfactory when next May ushers in the 30th anniversary of that sun-drenched FA Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, Keith Houchen\u2019s diving header, Brian Kilcline\u2019s wild hair and Sillett swigging imaginary champagne, back in the days when it felt like that competition meant everything. There are Coventry supporters of a certain generation who can remember when it was their team making similar headlines to the ones Southampton now attract and, in 1970, winning 2-1 against Bayern Munich in the Inter\u2011Cities Fair Cup, the equivalent of the Europa League (albeit having lost 6-1 in the first leg). These days, however, they are just trying to make sure \u201cplay up, Sky Blues\u201d is not heard in the fourth tier next season. The fitness coach, it transpires, had to find a lawnmower and cut the grass after the team arrived for one match at the Ricoh to discover nobody else had bothered. And a once-proud club must look back at the day the deal was signed with Sisu and wish, desperately, it had been another way. United put beds ahead of football  Three years have passed since Ed Woodward, Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, said he would look at returning the words \u201cfootball club\u201d to the team\u2019s official badge and made it clear he did not agree with the decision, taken during the Peter Kenyon years, to remove it in the first place. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that change of badge,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cJoel [Glazer] didn\u2019t like that change. We will look at that and have a think about that. We are a football club, not a business.\u201d The two can go hand in hand, of course, but if United were serious about changing it back they appear to have quietly abandoned the idea and it is tempting sometimes to suspect their priorities might be somewhat blurred when they do not even hold a press conference after making Paul Pogba the world\u2019s most expensive footballer but arranged one last week to plug a bedding company from Shanghai. Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Luke Shaw looked absolutely thrilled, as you can imagine, to go through their carefully rehearsed lines about \u201cthe cutting-edge technology\u201d of the mattress that had just been lugged on stage and I have it on good authority the players, as a whole, have been complaining behind the scenes about the increasing amount of time they are expected to devote to these kind of commercial events. They get paid well enough, you might think, to suffer in silence but equally they probably have a point when they returned from one night game in London in the early hours and, rather than resting, had to clock in the following morning to film a go-kart race outside Old Trafford, driving a fleet of miniature Chevrolets. Andrew\u2019s elbow met by silence The video footage of Calvin Andrew elbowing an opponent to the side of his head is the most brutal piece of violence I have seen on a football pitch since the night, in 2006, when Ben Thatcher appeared to overdose on his own testosterone and delivered the forearm smash that left Pedro Mendes unconscious on the side of Manchester City\u2019s pitch. Andrew\u2019s assault on Peter Clarke while playing for Rochdale against Oldham Athletic last weekend has left him with a 12-match ban, one of the longest punishments ever meted out by the Football Association. It was a pity, though, that the announcement was not accompanied by any statement from his club making it clear what they thought of his behaviour, or any form of public contrition from the player, and it hardly reflects well on Andrew that he admitted the charge of violent conduct but also had the gall to argue it did not deserve more than the standard three-match ban.", "tags": ["Coventry City", "Southampton", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-05T20:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/marks-spencer-chequered-history-global-expansion-overseas-stores-timeline", "sentences": ["In November M&amp;S opens its first store in China in Shanghai."], "title": "M&S's chequered history of global expansion \u2013 timeline", "article": "Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s decision to close stores in 10 countries is the latest move in a chequered saga of international expansion and retrenchment dating to the 1970s. 1972 In its first foray abroad, M&amp;S opens a store in Canada and soon after buys three local chains: Walker\u2019s clothing stores, the women\u2019s clothes retailer D\u2019Allaird\u2019s, and Peoples, a general goods retailer.   Related: M&amp;S culls clothing business as major overhaul curtails global ambition    1975 M&amp;S opens in France with branches in Paris and Lyon.

It opens two stores in Hong Kong and moves into the US with the purchase of the New Jersey-based Kings grocery chain and Brooks Brothers, the preppy men\u2019s clothier, for almost $750m. 1992 M&amp;S, by now run by Richard Greenbury, sells Peoples in Canada but continues foreign expansion.  1996 The company opens its first German store in Cologne. By this time M&amp;S was adding countries rapidly through franchises in Denmark, Hungary, Malaysia, Turkey and other countries and ramping up its own operations in France and Spain.

M&amp;S announces plans to spend more than \u00a32bn on international expansion to make a quarter of revenues overseas by the early 21st century.  2000 M&amp;S sells its remaining 38 Canadian stores after the loss-making operation fails to shake off its dowdy image. 2001 New Belgian chief executive Luc Vandevelde announces a total withdrawal from mainland Europe to concentrate on rebuilding M&amp;S\u2019s ailing UK business. In the US, M&amp;S sells loss-making Brooks Brothers for $225m \u2013 less than a third of the price it paid 15 years earlier. 2006 M&amp;S cuts its final tie with the US by selling Kings after 18 years of ownership but Stuart Rose, who took over as chief executive in 2004, announces plans to open 150 mainly franchise stores overseas. Rose says M&amp;S was wrong to pull out of Europe under Vandevelde. 2008 Rose takes control of M&amp;S\u2019s franchised operations in eastern Europe and announces plans to open more stores in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. In November M&amp;S opens its first store in China in Shanghai. 2009 Another chief executive, Marc Bolland, announces his goal to be an international retailer. With emerging markets in favour, India and China are high on his list. 2011 Bolland takes M&amp;S back into Paris a decade after Vandevelde\u2019s withdrawal by opening a flagship store on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. 2014 Bolland announces plans to open 250 stores around the world with further expansion in France, Spain and Italy.  2016 Steve Rowe, Bolland\u2019s successor, abandons pretensions to be a global retailer, announcing he will close 53 overseas shops in 10 countries, including the Paris store.

Different country. Much, much bigger implications. That\u2019s the economic message from Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the year of shocks. By comparison, Brexit was a sideshow. If 1989 was the year that marked the beginning of the global age, 2016 has been the year when the basic tenets of globalisation have been challenged \u2013 first in the UK and now in the US. The wall came down in Berlin on a November night 27 years ago. The question now is whether they start going up again. It\u2019s not that there have not been beneficiaries from globalisation. The past quarter of a century has seen the development of a massive new middle class that has done well out of trade and the free movement of capital.   Related: Markets reassured by Trump victory speech after initial losses - live updates    But that middle class has been in Shanghai and Mumbai. Working people in the north of England and the rust belt of America think they have had a raw deal from an economic system that has favoured the well educated and the better off. Just like Brexit, Trump\u2019s victory is a rejection of the status quo \u2013 of multinational companies that don\u2019t pay their taxes, of trade deals weighted in favour of the boardroom rather than the workers on the shop floor, of year after year of squeezed living standards, of rising inequality, of being ignored and patronised. It is, of course, ironic that Americans have chosen a billionaire who doesn\u2019t appear to have paid much tax for the past couple of decades to be the next occupant of the White House, but in this race Hillary Clinton was the candidate of the establishment \u2013 the choice of Goldman Sachs and the Washington elite. Trump marketed himself as the outsider. So what are the implications of his victory? Financial markets seemed reassured by the president-elect\u2019s victory speech and the hope that Trump might not be as bad as feared meant the initial reaction on stock markets and on the foreign exchanges was muted. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Trump has threatened to build a wall across the Rio Grande and to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the biggest early casualty was the Mexican peso.           How the 2016 US election night unfolded    There are though potentially far-reaching medium and long-term implications of a Trump victory. The first involves the Federal Reserve, America\u2019s central bank. Janet Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, is now living on borrowed time. As an unabashed Clinton supporter, her term lasts until 2018 when she would almost certainly be replaced. Yellen may jump before she is pushed. If she does, Trump will bring in someone who is less keen on quantitative easing, the money-creation programme used by the Fed and other central banks since 2008 in order to boost economic activity.   Related: Will the US election mean the end of free trade?    Markets have already started to assess whether the Fed will now go ahead with the interest-rate rise it has signalled for December. US borrowing costs are likely to stay lower for longer. Trump\u2019s views about fiscal policy \u2013 tax, spending and the budget deficit \u2013 are not entirely clear, but he seems to want lower taxes, higher spending on America\u2019s clapped-out infrastructure and defence, and less federal borrowing. The prospects of cheaper borrowing and fiscal easing should lead to stronger growth in the short term. Financial markets are more concerned about the structural changes Trump is planning for the US economy. He has threatened to brand China a currency manipulator, a decision that could easily prompt a full-scale trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. The two trade deals Barack Obama has been negotiating \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) are dead in the water. Trump is no fan of the World Trade Organisation, the body that polices global trade and was created in the first flush of post-cold-war globalisation euphoria. The last time American economic policy was this protectionist was in the 1930s. Wall Street might not like that but it only has itself to blame. Globalisation resulted in massive and disruptive movements of capital around the world, which made some people at the top unbelievably rich but culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The impact of that crisis is still being felt, not just in poor economic performance but in political disenchantment. Trump is one result of the festering anger. If the year of shocks continues into 2017, Marine Le Pen may be another.

Mexico     A Mexican man reads a paper emblazoned with news on Donald Trump. Photograph: AFP/Getty    America\u2019s neighbour to the south has most to lose from the new Republican president. Trump\u2019s message to blue-collar voters in the rust-belt states was that US manufacturing jobs have migrated across the Rio Grande as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Bill Clinton in the early 1990s. Trump has said that if he cannot renegotiate Nafta he will pull out of the free trade deal altogether. He has threatened to put a 35% tariff on some Mexican goods and pledged to close the \u201csweatshops in Mexico that undercut American workers\u201d. In addition, he has said he would round up and send home up illegal immigrants living and working in America, 5 million of whom are thought to be Mexican. If implemented in full, the impact on the Mexican economy of these policies would be profound. Trade between the US and Mexico would slow, factories would close, foreign direct investment flows would dry up and millions of repatriated workers would have to be absorbed into the Mexican workforce. US consumers would see the price of some goods rise. Mexico is not the only central American country at risk. Claudia Calich, fund manager at the M&amp;G emerging market bond fund, says remittances from people working illegally in the US are worth 5.6%, 8% and 13.2% of GDP to the economies of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras respectively.  China     Zheng Gao, from Shanghai, China, takes a picture of the front page of a newspaper featuring Donald Trump. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    Some of Trump\u2019s economic manifesto has been hazy but his attitude to China could not have been clearer. He will instruct his Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, he will bring cases against Beijing to the World Trade Organisation, and he will consider imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports into the US to make it easier for American companies to compete. The US is the biggest single market for Chinese exports, accounting for about 20% of the total. There would be a risk that aggressive US trade policy could result in a marked slowdown in China\u2019s growth and a loss of manufacturing jobs. Faced with that possibility, Beijing would have two choices. It might take an emollient line, promising to increase direct investment into the US as a way of supporting Trump\u2019s attempt to rebuild the American economy. More likely, though, China would adopt an aggressive, nationalistic stance. Beijing is not without economic weapons, since it has amassed a vast stock of US Treasury bonds in recent years, the proceeds of its trade surplus with America. Beijing could meet Trump\u2019s threat with one of its own: to dump US assets. A tit-for-tat trade war, in which China puts tariffs on US exports, could not be ruled out either. The rest of Asia     Reaction to the US presidential election results in a bar in Tokyo. Photograph: Deletree/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock    Barack Obama has shifted the focus of US foreign policy. For most of the postwar period, Washington has looked eastwards across the Atlantic. Since the collapse of communist Russia and the rise of China, its gaze has been westwards across the Pacific. This has been reflected in all three manifestations of American power: military, diplomatic and economic. Obama saw the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a way of keeping countries such as Japan, Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia out of Beijing\u2019s orbit. All these countries have an export-led model of growth and Obama\u2019s plan was to create a US-led free trade zone that included all the major economies of the Pacific apart from China. That plan now lies in tatters. There will be no TPP under a Trump presidency and all the signs are that countries such as South Korea and Taiwan will be subject to the same protectionist strictures as Mexico and China. This would result in slower growth across Asia as exports and investment weaken. Japan, which has been in the doldrums for a quarter of a century and which remains on the brink of deflation, appears to be most at risk, but it is not alone in being anxious about the impact of Trump. In geopolitical terms, a tough US trade stance provides China with the opportunity to increase its influence in the region, bolstering economic ties and making countries of the Pacific rim less dependent on the American market. Europe excluding Britain     A broker reacts as President-elect Donald Trump appears on a television screen at the stock market in Frankfurt, Germany. Photograph: Michael Probst/AP    The main short-term risk to Europe looks to be political rather than economic. Matteo Renzi\u2019s left of centre government may struggle to win a referendum on constitutional change in Italy next month. There are elections next year in Germany, France and the Netherlands where parties of the right will be looking to surf the populist tide that carried Trump to his win. There will be nervousness in the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia about the possibility that Russia will be emboldened by Trump\u2019s apparent isolationism. There are, however, economic and financial implications for Europe. Like Asia, the eurozone is heavily reliant on exports as a source of growth. These could be affected in two ways: through a more restrictive US trade regime and if a weaker dollar drives up the euro on the foreign exchanges.  Completing negotiations for the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) always looked like an uphill struggle because Trump was against the concept in principle and Hillary Clinton \u2013 despite being a free trader by instinct \u2013 was not prepared to spend any political capital pushing for a deal. TTIP will never happen. The relative calm of financial markets immediately after Trump\u2019s victory will come as a great relief to European banks, which look highly vulnerable to a sustained bout of jitters. For months, there have been rumours about the health of the Italian banking system and one of Germany\u2019s leading banks, Deutsche. Plentiful supplies of cheap money from the European Central Bank and relatively benign conditions in recent months have kept the problems hidden from sight. For now, at least. Britain     Political artist Kaya Mar shows a US election-themed artwork at College Green, Westminster. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock    The UK will not be immune from any slowdown in the global economy that might result from a Trump victory. Britain is the second biggest exporter of services in the world and America takes more of them than any other country. But Trump\u2019s protectionist measures are targeted at cheap manufactured goods, rather than the high-end services Britain provides, so at present there seems little reason to fear that any new barriers will be erected for UK firms. Trump has said the UK will be at the front of the queue for a new trade deal, which suggests negotiations on a bilateral TTIP-style deal could get under way between Washington and London. This would be helpful to Theresa May, who has been struggling to show that the UK can clinch its own trade deals after it leaves the EU. Her bargaining position with the other 27 members of the EU will be strengthened if she can show that she can do business with Trump, even though the stalled state of the current TTIP negotiations suggests that starting talks will be a lot easier than concluding them. In the short term, Trump\u2019s win helps take the pressure off the pound. Sterling has been sold heavily against the dollar since the EU referendum, partly because of uncertainty about what the UK will look like after Brexit.

The site, about 100km north of the Arctic Circle, serves as a major reindeer migration route \u2013 an increasingly rare natural phenomenon \u2013 and is one of the very few centres of plant species richness in the Arctic. Virtually untouched by human influence, this isolated mountain range includes pristine forests and cold-water lake and river systems. The lakes are characterised by elongated, fjord-like shapes, such as lake Ayan in the upper-central part of the image. Zooming in on the lake we can see that it is mostly ice-covered, with small patches of water peeking through around its lower reaches. Another feature of this area are the flat-topped mountains, formed by a geological process called \u2018plume volcanism\u2019: a large body of magma seeped through Earth\u2019s surface and formed a blanket of basalt kilometres thick. Over time, cracks in the rock filled with water and eroded into the rivers and lakes we see today.      Once clouds have cleared away, the effects of major storms can often be viewed from space for days and weeks. This photograph shows roughly 20km (12 miles) of coastline and islands on the northwest coast of Australia. The tan and white swirls in the sea are sediments that washed out after an unusual rainfall event during the dry season. Rain fell inland about five days before this image was taken, and the sediment was channelled down local rivers and out into Collier Bay. Long, narrow patches of sediment also show the direction of the local ocean current, which runs from east to west (lower right to upper left). The biggest islands \u2013 Traverse and Woninjaba \u2013 have the biggest sediment patches. The Kimberly region of Western Australia is so remote that boat and helicopter are the usual means of moving through this wilderness area. Tourists are drawn to the natural beauty of the mountainous scenery.      Fall in northern Sweden is a brief but spectacular affair. For a few weeks in October, alpine forests in this remote part of Swedish Lapland turn blazing shades of yellow and orange. Birch forests growing along stream valleys are probably the source of most of the colour, though other deciduous shrubs and understory plants surely contribute as well. Some of the hills have a dusting of snow. The southern sun\u2019s low angle above the horizon draws long, dark shadows across the landscape. In Lapland, the local name for leaf peeping season is ruska, the time of year when Scandinavians head outdoors to savour nature\u2019s display before the long, dark winter descends.      This image of Hurricane Matthew shows the massive storm converging on the Florida coast  On 4 October, Hurricane Matthew made landfall on south-western Haiti as a category-4 storm \u2013 the strongest storm to hit the Caribbean nation in more than 50 years \u2013 bringing 145mph winds and torrential rains that killed almost 900 inhabitants, destroyed thousands of homes, displaced tens of thousands of people, ruined plantations and drowned animals. Earlier on 4 October, temperature data collected by Modis on Nasa\u2019s Aqua satellite revealed that the cloud tops around Matthew were very cold (at least -57C). Cold cloud tops are known to produce heavy rainfall. The National Hurricane Center called for 380 to 500mm of rain in southern Haiti and in the south-western Dominican Republic.       October is a month of transition for weather patterns over the Arabian Sea. In the summer, winds blow from the sea toward land. In the winter, the winds reverse and blow over the Arabian Sea from the northeast. During October, between the summer and winter monsoons, the prevailing wind direction varies. This image on 26 October shows northeasterly winds blowing dust plumes off the coast of Iran and Pakistan.       The Chinese city of Shanghai is the country\u2019s most populous city \u2013 with over 24 million people. It is also the site of the world\u2019s busiest container ports owing to its strategic location on the Yangtze river delta. If we take a closer look at the Yangtze along the top of the image, we can see multiple ships in its waters, as well as in the smaller tributary \u2013 the Huangpu river \u2013 flowing through the city centre. Shanghai\u2019s famous skyline is located on a peninsula on the east side of the river near the centre of the image. What was mainly farmland and countryside until about two decades ago is now home to Shanghai\u2019s skyscrapers, including the Oriental Pearl Tower. Another noticeable feature in this area are the brightly coloured rooftops of housing projects in red and blue. The city\u2019s historic centre sits on the opposite side of the Huangpu River, appearing darker in colour owing to its dense population. Half of Shanghai\u2019s residents live in this district. The Sentinel-2 mission monitors our changing lands and cities, tracking urban expansion to assist urban planners to ensure the sustainable management of densely populated areas.   Rupert Bay in northern Quebec   In remote Rupert Bay in northern Quebec the majesty of fluid dynamics is regularly on display. With several rivers pouring into this nook of James Bay, the collision of river and sea water combines with the churn of tides and the motion of currents past islands to make swirls of colourful fluid. As they wind through the boreal forests and wetlands of Northern Quebec, the rivers that flow into Rupert Bay often carry water stained brown with tannins and lignins \u2013 chemical substances found in plants and soil that can leach into the water and give it a yellow, brown, or even black colour. (The same process gives tea its dark colour.) This image captured tannin-stained (dark brown) river water flowing into the bay at the same time that turbid seawater appeared to be pushing in due to the rising tide. Note that the coloured plumes and intricate vortices around the islands are pointing inland indicating that the tide was likely coming in or that northwesterly winds were affecting the flow of the water.       Myriad, overlapping river channels distinguish what is known in Australia as the Channel Country. This photograph of northwest Queensland shows the channels flowing south toward lake Eyre. The floodplain includes hundreds of channels, as the Georgina, Burke, and Hamilton rivers merge into the very broad floodplain of Eyre creek (more than 30km across). Landscapes in the Channel Country are generally very flat and drainage is poor, which encourages wetlands to form. The densest vegetation and the concentrated channels form a semi-permanent wetland at the meeting point of the rivers. These wide Australian floodplains are unique on the planet. Scientists think they are caused by the extreme variation in water and sediment discharges from the local rivers. In many years there is no rainfall at all, so these rivers are effectively non-existent. In years of modest rainfall, the main channels will carry water, with some neighbouring channels carrying minor floodwater. (That water can remain for months in narrow waterholes known as billabongs.) But every few decades, the floodplain needs to carry extremely high discharges of water. These heavy floods come from tropical storms to the north and can inundate the entire width of the floodplain. On such occasions, the floodplain appears as series of brown water surfaces with only tree tops indicating the location of the islands.       New Delhi\u2019s geometric patterns \u2013 designed by British architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker \u2013 contrast sharply with Old Delhi (top) and eastern Delhi (right). The Rajpath (King\u2019s Way) is a wide boulevard that links the hexagonal India Gate Circle with the Rashtrapati Bhavan (president\u2019s house) to the left. A third landmark, Connaught Circus, creates the northern point of an equilateral triangle.      A heavy blanket of smoke filled the air south of the Himalayas as dozens of actively burning fires speckled the landscape in northwest India in mid-October. Most of the red hotspots, which mark actively burning fires, cluster in the state of Punjab. Known as India\u2019s \u201cbread basket\u201d, Punjab is a rich agricultural region, growing about 20% of wheat produced in India and 10% of the rice. Many farmers use fire to clear leftover plant debris and ready fields for the next plantings, a practice known as stubble or paddy burning. The smoke contains particulates and chemical compounds which are respiratory irritants and can damage the health of people and livestock. In some areas of the world the smoke from agricultural fires disperses over a wide area, minimizing the effect in any one locale. In northwest India, however, the tall Himalaya mountains form a formidable barrier to smoke dispersion, resulting in heavy layers of thick smoke hanging over the valleys south of the mountains. In this image the smoke east of the Punjab region is so thick that the ground is obscured from view.      Strong winds kick up a spectacular dust storm off of Alaska, with northerly winds blowing dust from the Copper river delta. The iron- and feldspar-rich dust has been created by the grinding of glaciers against underlying bedrock and appears grey and grainy in this image. The silty powder is also called \u201cglacial flour\u201d or \u201crock flour\u201d and can find its way into rivers and lakes, especially during springtime snow melt when the water levels are high. Glacial flour in flowing rivers can be carried far downstream before settling out on dry land when river levels drop. Once dry, the flour can be easily lifted by winds and carried long distances. The Copper river forms a broad delta, about 80 km wide, where the waters flow into the Gulf of Alaska. Glacial flour accumulates along the course of the river, as well as in the delta, making the valley a rich source of spectacular dust storms.

The Galapagos Islands are situated in the remote Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 km from Ecuador. Their geography and location at the confluence of three ocean currents create a unique and biodiverse environment \u2013 both on land and underwater. The islands first became famous after Charles Darwin visited in 1835 and created his theory of evolution by natural selection after studying the unique adaptation of species to various environmental niches found on the islands. The Galapagos archipelago is made up of 127 islands, islets, and rocks, 19 of which are large and only four inhabited. The islands are volcanic in origin and the volcanic processes of island formation are continual. Isabela and Fernandina Islands are young islands, less than one million years old. The oldest islands are aged somewhere between three and five million years old. Wolf Volcano, located on the northern end of the reversed-L-shaped Isabella Island and straddling the equator, is an active volcano. The rocky nature of the islands can be seen in the large amount of greys and tans in the landscape. Bright green vegetation is evident, particularly inland. The largest four islands seen in this image are, from west to east: Fernandina, Isabela, Santiago, and Puerto Ayora.      September 2016 was the warmest September in 136 years of modern record-keeping, according to a monthly analysis of global temperatures by scientists at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York. This map of the September 2016 LOTI (land-ocean temperature index) anomaly, shows that much of the warmer temperatures occurred in the northern hemisphere.  The record-warm September means 11 of the past 12 consecutive months dating back to October 2015 have set new monthly high-temperature records. Updates to the input data have meant that June 2016, previously reported to have been the warmest June on record, is, in GISS\u2019s updated analysis, the third warmest June behind 2015 and 1998 after receiving additional temperature readings from Antarctica. The late reports lowered the June 2016 anomaly by 0.05 degrees Celsius to 0.75. \u201cMonthly rankings are sensitive to updates in the record, and our latest update to mid-winter readings from the South Pole has changed the ranking for June,\u201d said GISS director Gavin Schmidt. \u201cWe continue to stress that while monthly rankings are newsworthy, they are not nearly as important as long-term trends.\u201d      Large chunks of broken ice float in east-central Kazakhstan\u2019s Alakol lake. This salt lake usually freezes for about two months at the end of winter, and breaks up in early spring \u2013 as we can see happening here. The lake\u2019s mineral-rich water and mud is considered to be therapeutic, and tourists often visit the lake\u2019s northern shores to remedy skin ailments. Alakol means \u2018multicoloured lake\u2019 \u2013 and we can clearly see varying shades of green and blue depending on the depth, sediments flowing in from rivers and streams and phytoplankton. The two smaller, shallower lakes to the northwest are Kosharkol and Sasykkol. The Alakol\u2013Sasykkol lake system is both a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance and a Unesco biosphere reserve. It is an important migratory stop and nesting area for a variety of water birds, including the Dalmatian pelican and greater flamingo.      The Chesapeake and Ohio canal runs for 297km from Georgetown in Washington, DC, to Cumberland, Maryland, generally following along the north bank of the Potomac river. Constructed over a span of 22 years starting in 1828, the canal historically played an important role in transporting goods, primarily coal. The canal, towpath, and surviving system of locks and structures, are now a national historic park. This image shows the stretch between Hancock and Cumberland, Maryland. where one of the more infamous delays occurred in building the canal, near Paw Paw, West Virginia. Here the Potomac takes on a sinuous shape (seen in the centre of the image). Meanders along the rivers and streams in this region are not uncommon but the Paw Paw bends curve to such a degree that engineers determined they would save 10km of canal by bypassing four of the bends incised deep in the bedrock. They decided instead to route the canal through the ravine of a tributary, and then excavate through shale rock to construct a 950-meter-long tunnel (3,118ft), the largest structure along the canal. Work started in 1836 and was completed 14 years later, 12 years longer than first planned.      Oil fires, gas flares, and fires across the Middle East, seen as red hotspots in the image. Hotspots can be caused by a variety of heat sources\u2013 hotspots combined with grey smoke indicate an actively burning vegetation fire. Several such fires can be seen in the northern section of the image, scattered in the light green areas of Turkey and northern Iran. Further south, thick, oily-black smoke, typical of oil fires, rises from a number of hotspots north of Thertar Lake in Iran, where a number of oil wells and storage facilities are located. Oil fires have significant impact on human health and the environment, and have become all too common in oil-rich regions suffering violent conflicts. These fires cluster northwest in an area where war rages as Iraqi Security Forces and an International Coalition (CJTR-OIH) attempt to retake the area from Isis. Oil facilities have become targets in war, and also can be unintentionally damaged. In the south of the image, small hotspots can be seen aligned in a linear fashion north of the Persian Gulf. There is no visible smoke from these hotspots. While it is difficult to know for certain, these are likely gas flares. These are flames produced by a device that allows the burning off of flammable gas produced by pressure relief valves or planned, controlled, combustion. Such fires burn in small areas, do not spread (as natural fires would as they consume fuel) and produce almost no smoke.", "tags": ["Environment", "Space"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-10T12:23:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/10/nts-radio-comes-to-los-angeles-henry-rollins-london", "sentences": ["The station, which has a reputation for eclectic shows that run the gamut of underground dance music, jazz and hip-hop, has expanded from its east London home before with studios in Manchester and Shanghai.", "Related: Neneh Cherry launches The Guardian Radio Hour series \u2013 hear the show    A statement read: \u201cAfter opening permanent studios last year in Manchester and Shanghai and running regular programming from Berlin and more than 20 other European cities, NTS are officially coming to America.\u201d The station, which began life five years ago, will broadcast every Thursday and Friday from 9am to 12am, and begins with a breakfast show from DJ Lance Rocks."], "title": "NTS radio comes to Los Angeles with two-day-a-week programme", "article": "London\u2019s NTS radio station will begin broadcasting from Los Angeles two days a week from Thursday 10 November with hosts including former Black Flag frontman Henry Rollins, Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Alessandro Cortini and British electronic producer Bonobo.

Out on the stump, there was no doubt which country Donald Trump held most guilty for the loss of American jobs and saw as the major obstacle to making America Great Again. But going head to head with China would involve a nexus of problems that a business-savvy chief executive should wish to avoid. So will Trump\u2019s natural combativeness and the pumped-up feelings of his core supporters prevail, or will reason force itself on him?    Going head-to-head with China would involve a nexus of problems that a savvy chief executive should wish to avoid    The China conundrum is emblematic of the huge uncertainty surrounding the president-elect. We know the campaign rhetoric about slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese goods. We know that he accuses Beijing of being a currency manipulator and using America as a \u201cpiggy bank\u201d. We know the person he endorses as \u201cright on\u201d about China, university professor Peter Navarro, sees war with the People\u2019s Republic as \u201cvery likely\u201d, argues that \u201cBill Clinton sold America down the Shanghai River\u201d, and urges the US to fight China\u2019s mercantilism by being tough on trade and taxing China\u2019s exports. But President Trump would be well advised to steer away from the rhetoric of Candidate Trump in dealing with the world\u2019s second biggest economy and the rising superpower, accepting the all-important nuances of the world\u2019s single most important relationship. When Deng Xiaoping perceived at the end of the 1970s that the way to make China great again and to save the Communist party from implosion was to pursue economic growth, he turned to exports. The bargain that emerged suited everybody, and led to the entry of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. China got its growth from selling cheap goods abroad, and attracted foreign investment and technology. Rich countries, led by the US, got cheap imports that kept down inflation and satisfied consumers. The deal got even better when Beijing recycled its earnings into US government bonds, providing capital to help fuel a credit binge. That changed in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Barack Obama skirted round the China question as best he could. Now Trump has to decide how to proceed. It is no longer simply an economic issue. Abandoning Deng\u2019s advice to keep a low international profile, Xi Jinping aspires to walk tall beside any president from across the Pacific. Though far behind America in terms of overall military strength, the PRC has been building up its forces and asserting its presence in the South China Sea. Forecasts that it will rule the world are confounded by a host of political, economic, social and strategic factors. But, for a president who aspires to make America the unchallenged world champion, the presence of a country intent on becoming equal geopolitical number one can only be troubling. There is no shortage of issues on which to confront China, stretching from trade through intellectual property rights to the mainland\u2019s reef-building programme in the South China Sea and its unwillingness or incapacity to bring North Korea to heel. One might even add human rights, if they seemed a matter of concern to any of the presidential candidates. But if Beijing comes under pressure on one front, it is likely to react on another. The economic story is interconnected; slapping tariffs on products made in China may play well in depressed manufacturing areas, but there would be a big negative effect on US firms with plants on the mainland, or which assemble goods there \u2013 and Chinese retaliation would hit their important mainland revenues. Beijing is making the most of the electoral outcome, its media warning that this is what democracy brings. It will seek to exploit doubts about a Trump administration\u2019s engagement in the fraught situation in east Asia \u2013 not only over Korea and the South China Sea, but also with animosity between China and Japan, the unresolved matter of Taiwan and growing the way the US urged governments to participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and then repudiated the trade deal. Trump\u2019s talk of changing the relationship with allies adds to the discomfort. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, quickly booked himself a meeting with the president-elect, who is said to regard treaties as akin to contracts open to renegotiation. Four decades on from China\u2019s economic opening-up, there is little mutual trust between it and the US, but each knows it needs the other. A grand deal between Washington and Beijing remains highly elusive. If Trump were to aspire to seek it \u2013 in a new, realpolitik framework \u2013 he would have to turn his back on core voters and manage a multifaceted strategy at odds with the simplicity of his campaign and his isolationist tendencies. Hence the importance of the test \u2013 and the probability that each side will continue to prefer to rub along with the other.", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "China", "Asia Pacific", "US economic growth and recession", "Economics", "Business", "World news"], "publicationDate": "2016-11-11T08:30:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/13/america-trade-deals-donald-trump-nafta-isolationism", "sentences": ["Drive round the ailing industrial towns of south Yorkshire or Ohio and compare the economic and social landscape with that of D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich, Shanghai or Shenzhen."], "title": "Trade is the lifeblood of humanity. Closed doors lead to closed minds | Will Hutton", "article": "For 70 years, the US and Britain have underwritten the open global trading system, partly because of a stubborn and correct belief in the merits of free trade, partly out of self-interest as beneficiaries of globalisation and partly because, strategically, it spreads democracy, peace and capitalism. They have spearheaded successive rounds of tariff cuts and multilateral trade deals and stood by, first, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and its successor, the World Trade Organisation, to keep the system honest. They have cut regional trade bargains, promoted the European single market and, above all, kept their markets open despite other countries, notably China, gaming the system for their own narrow advantage. The consensus in both countries was that the wider gains transcended any localised pain. No longer. The Americans voting for the anti-trade, America first Trump have consigned all that to history and the unintended consequence of Brexit will mean the same for Britain. The system that underpinned our collective prosperity is about to be trashed. It brought national and international benefits, including an avalanche of inward direct investment into both countries, powerful international financial and business service sectors, rising global living standards and the economic and democratic transformation of Asia. But both countries\u2019 manufacturing sectors have taken disproportionately heavy hits. Drive round the ailing industrial towns of south Yorkshire or Ohio and compare the economic and social landscape with that of D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich, Shanghai or Shenzhen. Decade of consistent manufacturing trade deficits have exacted a cruel toll. This year, working-class voters across America and Britain\u2019s rotting industrial heartlands delivered their verdict. No more plants moving abroad. No more closures because of cheap imports. No more sales of great companies to foreigners. No more stagnating blue-collar wages. No more immigration. It may be that there are jobs and great prospects aplenty in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global trade, but they don\u2019t care. They are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them. The votes for Trump and Brexit mark the end of an era and a new dark age of closure, protectionism and nationalism. Leading Tory Brexiters will insist that this is a travesty of their position; they want Britain to access more global trade and not be imprisoned, they crazily claim, by the confines of the slow-growing European Union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world. They live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than Europe, while EU membership did not hold back Germany from being among the world\u2019s major exporters. In any case, apart from the promised closure of borders to immigrants, that is not what their voters want, as Nigel Farage always better understood than any of his Tory allies he cordially despises. Working-class voters in south Yorkshire and the West Midlands want the same as their counterparts in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. After all, it was those three states, with their tiny 100,000 vote margin, which gave Trump the electoral college votes for victory. He might be a billionaire, but he is, or at least styles himself, a \u201cblue-collar billionaire\u201d. Blue-collar (post-)industrial workers don\u2019t benefit from free trade and immigration, as he has consistently said for 18 months, in the teeth of opposition from the Republican mainstream who remain free traders. His movement, as he called it, wants to stop both.    Trade, exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of humanity    \u2018Build that wall\u201d \u2013 along the US-Mexican border \u2013 was one of the most insistent chants at his rallies, along with the forced deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants. But more importantly for the international trading system, Trump wants to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico, which he casually dismisses as the \u201cworst trade deal in history\u201d. He also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the Transatlantic and Trans-Pacific trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing 45% tariffs, against the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) from which he is prepared to \u201cwalk away\u201d, on Chinese imports, which account for half of the US\u2019s trade deficit. Thirty-five per cent tariffs are promised on Mexican imports. The remaining 20 free-trade agreements the US has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated. Cumulatively, the impact would be devastating, killing multilateralism by exposing the already enfeebled WTO as helpless, inciting Chinese and Mexican trade retaliation and destabilising the entire global system of trade and finance. Optimists say that Trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than Trump the campaigner: his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced agreements, not a tearing up of the world system. Maybe. But there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy. He believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution. Not Dan DiMicco, his senior trade adviser, who has promised a potential withdrawal, in the first six months of the Trump presidency, from every major US trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the US. \u201cThe era of trade deficits is over,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be: let\u2019s talk, but otherwise we put tariffs on.\u201d Another intimate, Walid Phares, has said Trump will go \u201cback to ground zero\u201d on every trade deal, such as the one with South Korea that the president-elect described as \u201cjob destroying\u201d and wants to revoke. Trump has already given a commitment that on day one he will declare China a currency manipulator as a precursor to introducing up to 45% tariffs on Chinese imports. These positions are not posturing: they represent a deeply held view that the US does not need trade except on terms that put America first. The idea that successive American administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the US interest is impossible to concede. Because how else would he explain the rust belt? Equally, there can be no concession that blue-collar jobs are disappearing with or without trade because of robotisation and automation. The America of the 1940s and 50s has disappeared for ever and destroying the international trading system is not going to bring it back. None of that cuts any ice with a demagogic populist. Trump has promises to keep to a \u201cmovement\u201d that expects no less. The last time a Republican president and his party controlled both the House of Representatives and Senate with the same convictions on America first trade was 1928. There were warnings that introducing the Smoot-Hawley tariffs on American imports in 1930 would trigger a slump, but America first Republicans could not help themselves and the Democrats were too weak to stop them. The Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington predicts that if Trump raises tariffs on China and Mexico, and they retaliate, then US growth will stop in its tracks for at least two years. The prospects could be even worse if Trump goes further. Already world trade growth over the last year has been the slowest for the last 15. Even introducing the mildest of Trump\u2019s measures must presage a further deceleration and if he goes as far as he promises \u2013 walking away from the World Trade Organisation, withdrawing from multiple trade agreements and freely imposing tariffs \u2013 then the prospect of a 1930s-style implosion is all too real. In this context, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, babbling alongside other Brexiters about the opportunities for trade deals with the US is surreal. To exit the EU, the one continent pledged to open trade, in order to plunge into a world trade system threatened by collapse is the height of folly. If British voters had known Trump was going to be president in June \u2013 and known of his attitude to trade \u2013 Remain would have won comfortably. Parliament may find it has a duty to veto the application to exercise article 50 before the end of March; the referendum was only ever advisory and Trump\u2019s attitude to trade changes everything. One of the many tragedies of the rise of neoliberalism is that the promotion of international trade has been able to be portrayed by some on the left as part of the same portfolio of policies as austerity, privatisation and assaulting trade unions. Wrong. Trade is the essential ingredient of growth and prosperity. The rise of Egypt, Greece and Rome was because the Mediterranean promoted seaborne trade. The rise of maritime Europe after the middle ages was because of Atlantic trade. China has grown so explosively since 1978 because of its opening to trade. Autarchy, protection and closure to immigration have always meant economic stagnation and, lacking the stimulus of other cultures and ideas, a parallel freezing of innovation and cultural vitality. Trade, exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of humanity. Of course trade brings losers, and the rise of contemporary Conservatism, with its ferocious enmity to state action to support the incomes, skills and life chances of working-class men and women, in a period of great economic change, laid the foundations of huge anger. It has been two rightwing demagogues \u2013 Trump and his British echo, Farage \u2013 who have been the first beneficiaries. But as this drama plays out in recession, nationalism and perhaps even forms of inter-state conflict, there will be a rediscovery of ancient verities.

The pressure on him now, as he seeks to win his fifth ATP World Tour Finals in a row and reclaim the rankings crown he lost to Andy Murray in Paris 10 days ago, is unlike everything else he normally goes through. Djokovic knows when he steps on court that he wins eight times out of 10, whoever he is playing. That certainty has been dented.   Related: Kei Nishikori beats Stan Wawrinka in ATP World Tour Finals opener    Against Murray he is 34-10 win-loss over the course of their near-parallel careers. They cannot meet for a 35th time until the semi-final on Saturday at the earliest, and that would provide as rousing a finish to the season as we have seen in a long time. Murray does not want to be a two-week wonder at the head of the rankings. Against the other three players in his group at this tournament, Djokovic is 24-0 after surviving an edgy first set to beat the nothing-to-lose young Austrian Dominic Thiem on his London debut on Sunday afternoon. On Tuesday night, Djokovic looks for victory No25 against the trio ranged against him, this time taking on Milos Raonic, whose torn right quad forced his retirement in Paris but who looked near to his powerful best beating Ga\u00ebl Monfils in straight sets on Sunday night. However, Djokovic\u2019s hold over him is total: 7-0, the most recent win coming in two quick sets on the Madrid clay in the summer. Yet it has invariably been in defeat that Djokovic has spoken most movingly and with the sharpest insight about himself and his sport. After a loss to Marin Cilic in the last Masters 1000 tournament of the year handed Murray his ranking supremacy after a reign of 123 weeks [when the Scot then was prematurely crowned after Raonic pulled out of their semi-final], he was considerably more measured than when he snapped in victory over Thiem. He responded with undisguised impatience on Sunday when asked if hitting the ball into the crowd at the end of the first set was part of a worrying pattern of behaviour and whether or not he was comfortable with his \u201cmindset\u201d, which he earlier in the year admitted had been disturbed by events on and off the court. It was a reasonable question to ask a player with the highest profile in his sport. \u201cYou guys are unbelievable,\u201d Djokovic said, before retreating to what probably was the relative comfort of more amenable questions from the Serbian media. They have been loyal allies and remain defensive about any criticism of their country\u2019s best and most famous athlete, as a cursory glance at social media will reveal. Yet Djokovic\u2019s Parisian take on life and tennis could not have been more candid. \u201cI\u2019m aware that I\u2019m not the only player in the world who wants to win when he gets out on the court,\u201d he said in defeat 10 days ago. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep playing at this level as long as I feel like that\u2019s the right thing for me. I have to get to that state of mind where I\u2019m able to perform as well as I want to, match after match. I was not able to find that level for the last couple of months.\u201d He added: \u201cA lot of things are coming out, a lot of things, a lot of emotions went through my mind and body in the last two years. It took a lot out of me.\u201d Yet it is when Djokovic is wounded, physically or spiritually, that he has found the iron will of a champion. In the ATP\u2019s Under Pressure ratings, he leads Andy Murray 271.1 to 257.5 over the past 52 weeks - although his stats will have taken a light hit since he lost to Sam Querrey in the third round at Wimbledon. In the subcategories of the rankings, Djokovic has converted 42.4% of break points (Murray 45.1), saved 67.9 (65.8), won 73.9% of tie breaks (70.4) and, most pertinently, 87.5% of deciding sets, to Murray\u2019s 76.2%. All of those numbers are impressive for both players, who they lead Kei Nishikori, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, Thiem, Raonic, Lucas Pouille, Richard Gasquet, Viktor Troicki and Florian Mayer in the aggregated rankings. None of which will invade Djokovic\u2019s thinking when he steps out against Raonic. He knows his resilience under the cosh has wilted a little. He does not need reminding that the latter part of the season has been his most uncomfortable spell in a long while. Although he says his troubles began at Wimbledon, he won the Rogers Cup in Toronto without dropping a set. After that, it got seriously tough: Del Potro put him out of the Rio Olympics in the first round, inducing a tearful exit; Stan Wawrinka beat him at the end of a bizarre US Open, where a walkover and two retirements helped him into the final; world No19 Roberto Bautista Agut beat him for the loss of eight games in the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters; and Cilic, who had not beaten him in 14 attempts, completed the misery for him in Paris. The reality of battle consumes Djokovic. It delivers him the inner animal that resides in all great champions. If he is fit, he should beat Raonic, although it might take three sets. After that, he has the unique challenge of the unorthodox Monfils, who briefly confused him before losing in four crazy sets in the semi-finals at Flushing Meadows.

Next year they will transfer their show to Broadway, helped by one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. On Monday it was announced that Mischief Theatre company has partnered with JJ Abrams on a New York version of The Play That Goes Wrong, a show Abrams came across by accident in 2014 while he was filming Star Wars. The move continues the meteoric rise of Mischief Theatre, which has three productions being performed in the West End, one of which is due to be a highlight of the Christmas TV schedules.  It has been something of a rollercoaster, admitted Jonathan Sayer, who along with Henry Lewis and Henry Shields founded the company and came up with the idea for The Play That Goes Wrong, which joyously combines the physicality of silent movie slapstick with the \u201cplay what I wrote\u201d comedy of Morecambe and Wise. \u201cWe are in a wonderful position and have been given a wonderful opportunity,\u201d said Sayer. \u201cWe are amazed really and delighted.\u201d The Play That Goes Wrong imagines the efforts of Cornley Polytechnic amateur dramatic society putting on a clunky 1920s murder mystery. The acting is terrible, the script awful and everything does go wrong, but that is its joy. One newspaper reviewer wrote that he had never \u201cheard louder or more sustained laughter in a theatre\u201d. Sayer said there were several reasons for the show\u2019s success, not least the grim times the world is going through. \u201cWe are in a time where people really need some levity, some laughter and a bit of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that we really are having a huge amount of fun on stage communicates itself to the audience. Each show feels like an event,\u201d Sayer added. \u201cWe are very happy to be laughed at, not with. A lot of the work is about being embarrassed and humiliated and I think audiences really enjoy that. Everyone has been there, there is a global empathy for things going wrong in front of a group of people.\u201d The play, seen by more than a quarter of a million people, has been licensed to 29 countries and in the last year has been performed in Japan, France and Hungary. It is soon to open in Rome, Shanghai, Bucharest, Warsaw, Johannesburg, Cape Town and Melbourne. Audiences everywhere seem to laugh at the same bits, said Sayer. \u201cI saw it in Budapest and it was identical apart from being in Hungarian.\u201d The success of The Play That Goes Wrong spawned Peter Pan Goes Wrong, which has returned to the West End for Christmas and next month will be shown on BBC One. After that came The Comedy About a Bank Robbery, which opened at the Criterion Theatre this year. Lewis, Sayer and Shields are the youngest writers ever to have three shows playing simultaneously in the West End. The trio founded Mischief Theatre as an improv group in 2008 after they graduated from London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda). Like many young actors, they struggled and worked minimum wage jobs in a Gourmet Burger Kitchen, a call centre and behind a bar to help make ends meet.  But they persisted. The first performance of The Play That Goes Wrong, then called The Murder Before Christmas, was in front of four people at the Old Red Lion theatre pub in north London.  It transferred to the Trafalgar Studios and then Edinburgh and became a gradual word-of-mouth success, winning best new comedy at the 2014 whatsonstage.com theatre awards, which are decided by the voting public rather than panels of experts.  When it transferred to the Duchess it was seen by audiences including Joanna Lumley, Tom Hardy, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. And then Abrams, in London filming his reboot of Star Wars. \u201cI was washing my hair in the sink when he came in, so I still had flour all over me,\u201d Sayer recalled.   Related: Am-dram, thank you ma'am: the rise of good-bad theatre    Abrams, best known for film (Star Trek, Mission Impossible III) and TV (Alias, Lost, Fringe), said he had been a fan of theatre all his life. He will co-produce the Broadway show. \u201cEmbarrassingly, I still have every playbill, from the very first shows my grandmother took me to,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw The Play That Goes Wrong on the West End, I hadn\u2019t laughed that hard \u2013 seen something as preposterously absurd or wonderfully hilarious \u2013 in ages. \u201cTo be part of the team bringing this inspired comedy to Broadway is a true honour. Whatever happens, I\u2019m saving the playbill.\u201d The original cast of the play, including Lewis, Sayer and Shields, will appear in the New York transfer. A UK tour of The Play That Goes Wrong is also planned for the summer of 2017. Doing things disastrously on stage has clearly taken over the lives of the three men, but Sayer said he would not have it any other way, and he did not lose sleep over not being able to deliver his Hamlet. \u201cI was brought up watching Morecambe and Wise with my family, watching Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin and going to comedy plays. I\u2019ve always wanted to do that, I\u2019m doing everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. I can\u2019t grumble.

Then in the past five years shining new trawlers appeared on the horizon, churned out by subsidised Chinese shipyards, earning their owners handsome subsidies if they travel outside China, where they run on subsidised fuel and exploit subsidised freight rates to get their frozen cargo back home. There seem to be unlimited funds available to buy licences to fish in ways that are far from transparent \u2013 and which have long been exploited by other Far East fleets and resourceful members of the European Union. China\u2019s distant water fleet is now the largest in the world, with about 3,400 vessels fishing in the waters of nearly 100 countries. Researchers estimate that nearly 75% of all the fish it caught came from African waters with almost 3m tonnes from west Africa. And there is, as far as we can see, a problem. Scientists working for the University of British Columbia, using a new way of estimating the size and value of catches, reported this year that just 9% of the millions of tons of fish caught by the Chinese in African waters is officially reported to the UN. All nations have to report annual catches to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation.  Once, if you wanted to understand how global trends in food consumption were affecting the health of the ocean, you would travel to different countries, stand on the fish dock and watch the boats come and go. Now you get a far better grasp of what is going on from a computer program that tracks fishing vessels by satellite. Focus in on west Africa and you will notice the extraordinary upsurge in the number of Chinese trawlers fishing there in the past four years. The program displays the routes of more than 400 industrial vessels, 220 of them from China \u2013 more than any other nation.     Chinese fishermen unload chub mackerels at Qingdao port Photograph: Hong Wu/Getty Images    Zoom in on the coast of mainland China itself and you will understand why the Chinese fleet ranges across the world from the south Pacific to the Caribbean to bring home the shrimp, sole and tuna for home consumption. Along the shoreline from Hong Kong to Shanghai no sea is visible beneath the blue triangles denoting fishing vessels with their automatic identification system (AIS) switched on. Scientists reported in 2013 that 30% of China\u2019s wild fisheries have collapsed and 20% were overfished. No one can blame China for trying to feed its 1.35 billion people. But the way it does it is coming under scrutiny, for there are persistent allegations that its fleet is involved in illegal, under-reported or unregulated fishing. In west Africa, some 1.2m tons of fish are caught by 274,000 artisanal fishermen, often in direct competition with industrial vessels. The result of this conflict is that stocks are in trouble all along the west African coast. Ghana recently had to propose a closed season of several months so fish could breed. The underlying problem is governance, or rather the lack of it. Under Ghanaian law, the beneficial owner of a fishing vessel is meant to be Ghanaian. The 60 licensed Chinese vessels in Ghanaian waters all fly the Ghanaian flag but the fish goes to China. Stephen Akester, co-ordinator of a World Bank programme designed to improve governance and fish-stock management from Mauritania to Ghana, says the source of the problem lies in the custom of fishing companies buying licences through trawler agents who make payments to politicians that see this as their main source of income. The agency system means more fishing capacity gets licensed than stocks can stand, local fishermen lose out and, if landings are not measured properly, government loses tax revenue. When confronted for buying licences illegally, a Chinese diplomat told Akester, who is British, \u201cYou had your turn, this is ours.\u201d     Fishing crew along Kokrobite beach Ghana. Photograph: Merten Snijders/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Images    The west African example brings home some of the difficulties the world faces in meeting UN sustainable development goal target 14.2, which aims by 2020 to \u201csustainably manage, and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience and take action for their restoration, to achieve healthy and productive oceans\u201d. The Overseas Development Institute has identified this target as one of the most difficult to achieve, because it requires a complete about-turn of current trajectories. On the bright side, some 6% of the world\u2019s oceans have now been proposed or designated as protected areas, mostly by developed nations in places far removed from large human populations.   Related: How can we reach an SDG target when we're moving in the wrong direction?    This target is a more challenging task on the west African coast, where it is often difficult to work out where bending the law ends and breaking it begins. Professor Percy Showers at the Institute of Marine Biology in Sierra Leone explains the impact of foreign fleets: \u201cThe stocks are being over-exploited and the situation is not getting better. There is a need for more caution in managing the stocks.\u201d Some fish species, such as the sea breams, are still holding up, but other species have almost disappeared. The enemy of both marine reserves and fish stocks is what is known as IUU, or \u201cillegal, unreported and unrecorded\u201d fishing. Global losses due to IUU fishing are estimated at between $10bn and $23.5bn (\u00a38bn and \u00a319bn) annually [pdf] and represent between 11 and 26m tonnes of catch. Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation, which has worked against overfishing and IUU fishing in Thailand, Indonesia and west Africa, said: \u201cIn order to achieve SDG 14, it is crucial that we put an end to IUU fishing. IUU fishing jeopardises the livelihoods and food security of some of the poorest communities in the world.\u201d Yet amid the gloom one example stands out and shows what can be done: Liberia. If you look at the computer program mentioned earlier, you will see that there are currently no industrial vessels currently at sea in Liberian waters. None at all. How can this be? Since it began working with the World Bank in 2011, Liberia has instituted a six-mile limit within which no industrial vessels may fish, along with fisheries monitoring that has reduced illegal fishing by 83% according to the ministry of agriculture and fisheries. The result has been that artisanal fishing communities have more than doubled their catch and some communities even report they are catching larger fish.     Fishing boat in Monrovia, Liberia Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images    This is a rare example of what Akester says should happen everywhere, the reallocation of natural assets to where they are needed most, in the artisanal fleet. The World Bank has worked with motivated politicians in Liberia and is helping to train a new generation of west African fishery managers who have not been contaminated by the agency system.    Liberian agriculture and fisheries minister Moses Zinnah says artisanal fishermen have praised the recovery in stocks    The Liberian agriculture and fisheries minister Moses Zinnah says artisanal fishermen have praised the tremendous recovery in stocks, which has put food on the table and increased income so they can afford to send their children to schools and hospitals. Tougher fisheries regulations may be in place and actually being enforced, but Liberia still intends to earn foreign currency by selling licences to foreign fleets to catch fish that its own fleet is not equipped to catch, such as tuna. So a five-year partnership agreement has been adopted by Liberia and the EU that will allow 28 purse seiners and six support vessels into Liberian waters under a strict surveillance regime.   Related: The e-waste mountains - in pictures    Are there any plans to admit the Chinese, who are hard at work in the other seven west African countries in the World Bank fisheries project? Liberia, Zinnah says, has no policy in place for discriminating against fishing vessels based on nationality. Currently 12 Chinese vessels have requested licences to fish in Liberian waters and these are being considered, provided they fish according to the same rules as EU vessels. Negotiations continue. \u201cThe rules are tough and we are not breaking the rules. It has been a bit tough for both sides,\u201d Zinnah observes. So sustainable use of the sea again hangs in the balance. If the UN goal for sustainable use of the world\u2019s oceans is to be achieved, examples like Liberia\u2019s must not only succeed but multiply.

Turkish officials said the vote was meaningless but that it raised questions about the entire partnership between their country and the European bloc. Germany, France and most other EU states back continued engagement. The EU and Turkey negotiated a deal in March of this year that halted the influx of refugees, particularly from Syria, into Europe in exchange for economic aid and a promise to grant visa-free travel to Turkish citizens within the Schengen zone. The latter clause has not been fulfilled. But relations collapsed after a failed coup attempt in July. Turkish officials say Europe has failed to show sufficient support in the aftermath of the putsch, and bristle instead at the repeated criticism of a purge of tens of thousands of civil servants, army officers and policemen accused of links to Fethullah G\u00fclen, a US-based preacher whose movement is widely believed in Turkey to have orchestrated the coup plot.

Can those old pictures of them riding unicycles and sharing ice creams, playing football, table tennis and computer games be real? When they first competed against each other they talked about how cool it would be if they ended up as team-mates in Formula One. Well, it\u2019s so cool now you can see a glisten on the frost.

Hamilton would mischievously persuade the rich young Rosberg to buy him sweets. Hamilton, said Chiesa, wanted to play more and fight more in those days. And he was the faster driver, even then. Rosberg, who once told me that \u201ceverything relates to physics and maths\u201d, had a serious side even then. Now he speaks five languages and reads the business pages; Hamilton does not. The pair were friends when they moved up to Formula Three, and friends still when they made it to F1 (Rosberg in 2006, Hamilton the following year). They even got on famously when Hamilton joined Rosberg at Mercedes in 2013, but that was the beginning of the big freeze.

Later that year, at Spa, the two crashed into each other. Mercedes later blamed Rosberg for the incident, which appeared to have a profoundly negative effect on his season.   Related: F1\u2019s age of chivalry, when drivers gave up cars for others, is a distant dream | Richard Williams    There was more ill-feeling last year, in Shanghai, where Rosberg accused Hamilton of compromising his race, and again in Austin, where Hamilton won his third title but annoyed Rosberg by aggressively forcing him wide at turn one to take the lead; that was followed by the infamous, pre-podium cap\u2011throwing incident. The two were \u201cplaying\u201d once more here earlier this week, sparring with each other in a special press conference, with the two men of the moment alongside each other. Hamilton was easily the more comfortable. Afterwards Hamilton, who topped both practice runs on Friday, said he had been amused by Rosberg\u2019s remark that he would continue to take one race at a time, \u201cbecause that\u2019s worked for me until now\u201d. Hamilton said: \u201cYeh, and some of my engine problems.\u201d Hamilton is a little obsessed with his engine difficulties and in truth he has had more bad luck than Rosberg this year. But he also had those flat weekends in Baku and Singapore. He has made five bad starts, which have cost him dear. They have won nine races apiece, with Hamilton leading the pole race 11-8. \u201cIf I was to win [the championship] it would by far be the greatest achievement of my career, for sure,\u201d he says.

Effluent from factories poured directly into its waters, which doubled as a public drinking well and sewer for the multi-generation families living on the sampans that crowded it from bank to bank. Cholera, typhoid, and dysentery were rampant. Now, what was once Asia\u2019s most notorious aquatic slum is poised to join the likes of Paris\u2019s Canal St Martin as an agreeable urban waterfront. A multi-million dollar redesign of 7\u00bd miles of canalside was recently awarded to Sasaki Associates, the Boston architect that collaborated on Chicago\u2019s applauded Riverwalk. \u201cThe idea,\u201d says Michael Grove of Sasaki, \u201cis that Suzhou Creek will be a place for visitors to stroll, as well as a corridor for commuters walking or cycling to and from the railway station.\u201d     Suzhou Creek from Broadway Mansions in 1935.

As a model, he points to the M50 art district, a warren of contemporary galleries in a disused textile mill further up the Creek.

Her grandmother, Elizabeta Moldovan, 80, was born in Bistrita, Romania. My grandmother was eight when the second world war passed through her village. With her father and brother fighting, soldiers swarming the village and bombs raining down, her mother decided to pack up their cow, pig, some clothes and polenta flour, and head for the nearby woods. They lived there, in the middle of a freezing autumn, for a month until the fighting subsided. \u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid,\u201d my grandmother tells me. \u201cI had a child\u2019s bravado and, more than that, my mind was occupied by something else: a calf that we\u2019d left on the farm. I remember feeling heartbroken that we\u2019d abandoned it, so I decided to go back to the village. It was an hour\u2019s walk. When I got there, all the windows in our house had been smashed and the floors were strewn with hay where soldiers had been sleeping. The calf was still there, weak and bleating. I dragged over as much feed as I could and a trough of water, then headed back. I tripped along, the ground shaking from the bombs, soldiers crashing through the fields to my left and right. I remember bullets hissing past, but I kept going. It never occurred to me that they might have hit me.\u201d I left Romania in 1993 and, though I\u2019ve always been close to my grandparents and make yearly pilgrimages to see them, I didn\u2019t know this story until last year. They often quizzed me about life and school, or, later, university, jobs, rents and career prospects, and I\u2019d answer, passively: \u201cFine, nice, expensive, difficult.\u201d It never occurred to me that I should show a similar interest in them.     \u2018This vision \u2013 of my grandmother, younger than I am now, feeling real despair, hopelessness \u2013 is sobering.\u2019 Photograph: Davin Ellicson for the Guardian    It\u2019s an attitude that\u2019s parodied in a particularly genius episode of US comedian Aziz Ansari\u2019s 2015 Netflix series Master Of None, called Parents. Sitting down to dinner with his family, he finally asks his Indian parents about their experiences. As well as poking fun at a particularly millennial brand of self-centredness, it portrays an epiphany that every immigrant\u2019s child has at some point in their life: compared with your ancestors, you will never work so hard, nor so long, nor face so many obstacles. In just half a century, the world has changed so definitively that my grandparents\u2019 experiences are almost unimaginable to me. And perhaps mine to them. \u201cDid anything ever make you anxious?\u201d I ask my grandmother. \u201cYou know \u2013 you can\u2019t breathe properly, your heart beats too fast?\u201d She looks puzzled. \u201cOK, is there anything that kept you awake at night?\u201d \u201cWell, my one great worry came when your mother was two [in 1970, when my grandmother was 34]. I got cancer. All I hoped for was that I\u2019d live for five more years, just long enough for her to remember who I was.\u201d There\u2019s a common refrain in Romania that goes something like, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter about anything else: as long as I have my health, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Having lived through the war, the communist regime, the revolution and the subsequent economic and ideological upheavals, my grandmother understandably subscribes to this school of thought. Career prospects, the cost of rent \u2013 those subjects that might keep me awake at night don\u2019t seem to have been as big a cause for concern. \u201cWhen I left school [aged 12],\u201d she says. \u201cI knew, for certain, that all I wanted was to get away from the village and that country way of life.\u201d \u201cIt seems as if every generation has that ambition,\u201d I say, \u201cto move away and do better.\u201d Walking with her mother one evening, my grandmother saw a man coming in the opposite direction, dressed in a navy uniform. He was freshly released from a four-year conscription. A mutual friend had told this man about her: a hardworking woman with dark hair and green eyes. A few days later, he turned up at her house, introduced himself and made a proposition: would she go with him to the city where he had the promise of a house and a job in a coalmine? \u201cAnd you said yes?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019d never met him before? You\u2019d never\u2026 had a chat?\u201d \u201cI knew him, a little \u2013 we had mutual friends \u2013 but no, we\u2019d never really spoken. My dad sat me down and said, \u2018You don\u2019t know this man from the next.\u2019 But I said, \u2018If even the wild animals in the countryside can work it out, I\u2019ll manage.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt seems\u2026 brave.\u201d \u201cYes, but if you\u2019ve got nothing to lose, it\u2019s easy to be brave.\u201d That man became my grandfather. \u201cI took a suitcase of clothes and Mum gave me a pan for cooking, and your grandfather and I went together. The house had a kitchen with a broken coal-burning stove and one other room. I walked in, and saw this miserable place with no furniture, and I sat down on my suitcase and cried. At 24, I saw myself for the first time as a poor woman.\u201d Laughably, I\u2019ve often seen myself as a poor woman, too \u2013 every 15th of the month, when the rent disappears from my account. But this vision \u2013 of my grandmother, younger than I am now, feeling real despair, hopelessness \u2013 is sobering. I may feel poor, but I buy lunch most days. And coffee. Despite my bank accounts sometimes running close to zero, my life seems somehow built on a more solid foundation. \u201cBut you had a house,\u201d I venture.     Elizabeta Moldovan at 28. Photograph: Davin Ellicson for the Guardian    \u201cYes, and in that respect I am luckier than you, maybe. It was a hard way of life, because at first there weren\u2019t shops where you could buy things, so I made everything myself [from cheese and butter to fabric from raw hemp]. But the communist system meant everyone had somewhere to live and everyone had work, even though the wages were low. Society generally isn\u2019t as nice as it was then.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? You think the capitalist system has made people less caring?\u201d \u201cYes. Now, everyone just wants to make money. Life has always been a struggle, no person has it easy. You have to pass through the fire and the water \u2013 as the saying goes \u2013 but somehow it seems better if there are people with you. It\u2019s why you should get married. When will you? You\u2019ve kept your boyfriend waiting long enough.\u201d My boyfriend and I have been together since university, and while there was a period when the thought of marriage appealed to me, that has long since passed. Nothing profound happened; it just stopped seeming important. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what I want.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t you want children?\u201d \u201cWell, I do want children, but I don\u2019t need to be married to have children.\u201d \u201cNo, but it\u2019s nice to have stability. Children need stability.\u201d At the heart of this small disagreement is that our understanding of stability doesn\u2019t quite align. To her, marriage is an immutable fact; my grandparents have been married for 56 years. For me, it represents a profoundly mutable life choice \u2013 a very special life choice, no doubt, but, like so many things nowadays, liable to change. \u201cOh, well, you shouldn\u2019t complicate it so much,\u201d my grandmother says when I explain this to her. \u201cYou pick a man and get on with it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re moving into a shared house soon, so I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re quite marriage-ready.\u201d \u201cWhy not just get your own place?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t really afford it at the moment.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re constantly going on holidays.\u201d \u201cYes, but what would you suggest? That I never see any of the world?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve seen more countries than I\u2019ve seen towns,\u201d she sighs. \u201cSave for a house. Get some nice furniture. What else do you need to see?\u201d Well, Japan, hopefully. But she\u2019s absolutely right, of course. Perhaps in my case, as with all first- or second-generation immigrants, the differences in our lives are a little starker. But I\u2019d venture that anyone who spends some time in conversation with an older family member will feel it: the dizzying sense of evolution in action. Generations of accidental encounters and near-misses \u2013 those bullets whistling through the corn \u2013 all leading, with haphazard precision, to you.

Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    Rowan Hisayo Buchanan, 27, is a writer who has lived in London, Norwich, New York, Tokyo and Madison, Wisconsin. Her grandmother, Jean, 87, was born in Shanghai and has lived in Hong Kong, Dallas and New York. At 87, my Shanghainese grandmother Jean resides alone on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. I lived in New York, drifting in and out of her apartment, until last autumn, when I moved to Norwich in England. I go to my windowsill with the best reception and ring her. I want to talk to her about the differences in our lives. I close my eyes, imagining I\u2019m in New York, listening to the pigeons that perch on her air-conditioner box. Is she picturing my little house that she has never seen and may never see? \u201cBy my age, you were married and had a baby, right?\u201d I ask. I have no child, no spouse, not even a cat. \u201cYou\u2019d been in America for seven years?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d she says, her voice lilting on the \u201cthis\u201d, then tells me how China was in the midst of a civil war. The communists had just taken over Shanghai and stopped all trains. When they decreed there would be one last run to Hong Kong, her mother bought her a ticket immediately. \u201cOn the train, there were families fleeing Shanghai. Little children, grandparents and so on. But I am 19; everything is something to look forward to.\u201d From there, she applied to Columbia University\u2019s MA programme, to study political science. In 1949, the college still did not accept women, but the graduate school did. Luckily, she\u2019d already got her degree. \u201cI graduated when I was 18 \u2013 that was when the communists came in. My class was the graduating class. The university sped up, gave us the test, gave us the diploma, and so we left. And later on, I learned my school president was executed.\u201d I, too, went to Columbia; by then, the college took women. Every summer, I lived with my grandmother. People said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice you\u2019re taking care of your grandma.\u201d In fact, she took care of me, buying me boxes of strawberries and rotisserie chickens. She was always offering to take me and my boyfriend out for sushi. \u201cYou met Grandpa at Columbia, right?\u201d He was a Japanese student getting his masters in international affairs. They met across a library desk and it turned out they took classes in common. \u201cInternational law and international relations.\u201d I say, \u201cThat seems appropriate\u201d, and she chuckles at my childish humour. On their first date, he took her to a Chinese restaurant, but it wasn\u2019t \u201cthe good one\u201d. She laughs. \u201cThere are all kinds of misunderstandings other than cultural.\u201d She saw a movie with a tandem in it and wanted to ride one. So he rented one. But she couldn\u2019t ride: \u201cNot a one-person bike or a two-person bike. I often have ideas that are\u2026 not reality.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why Mommy says I take after you.\u201d \u201cWell, I wish I write books, then I\u2019d be truly, truly your grandmother.\u201d Despite the \u201cnot reality\u201d, their courtship continued. \u201cI was living on campus in a graduate women\u2019s hall. We had a suite facing the street. In those days, the hall would close at midnight \u2013 no visitors, so everybody had to stay put. He used to buy hamburgers and throw them up to us.\u201d    By my age, you were married and had a baby, right?    They went out for pizza. \u201cWe had never seen a pizza before, and then one pizza place came and everybody was so excited. It had pepperoni on it and, of course, cheese. In those days, there\u2019s no choice of topping. Just one topping for all.\u201d After graduation, she worked for Scandinavian Airlines, preparing route maps. \u201cThey decided the different areas they are going into \u2013 it\u2019s just like connecting dots. You draw a line.\u201d She married and started her American family. \u201cDid you miss China?\u201d I ask. No matter where I live, I always manage to be homesick. \u201cNo. The Cultural Revolution came up. They drove my parents out of their place. My parents had no place to go. My mother had a stroke. I couldn\u2019t contact them for at least three years, because I don\u2019t know where they are. I probably would have lain down on the ground and given up, but then I had to take care of your mommy. If I don\u2019t take care of your mommy, where would you be? Right?\u201d     Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s grandmother, Jean. Photograph: Courtesy of Rowan Hisayo Buchanan    She raised my mother, and got a job at American Airlines using Sabre, the first industry-wide computer reservations system. At 50, she earned her MBA from Columbia and returned as a manager in the marketing department. Management or not, she was hands-on. When a programmer quit, she learned the programming language, Cobol, herself. \u201cWhen the computer malfunctioned, all the cards were just flying out.\u201d Feeling nervous, I ask what she thinks of my life. She says, \u201cThe world travels too fast. Any advice from anybody so old to anybody young is futile. By the time the advice spits out, it\u2019s from the past.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s scary,\u201d I say. \u201cFor me,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, too.\u201d She pauses, then adds gently, \u201cDo what you want \u2013 write. The only thing is, other than writing, what else would you like to do?\u201d I tell her I don\u2019t know, but that I would like to find a way to stop moving back and forth between places \u2013 to find somewhere permanent. \u201cWell, as I said to you one time, in China, as long as you are not married, the family is always there. I mean, you can stay as long as you want and you can leave any time you want.\u201d She pauses, and when she begins again, it is in an even softer voice, as if worried she\u2019ll upset me. \u201cBut, sooner or later, you have to have a more permanent thing. I mean, your own family, no?\u201d There is a person I love in London, but he and I are a long way from being a family. We are just two people who try to be kind to each other. My grandmother has not met him. I hope she will some day. I do not say this. Instead, I think of how young she married and ask how she was so certain: how did she know? \u201cI never know. The worst yet, I know what I want when it\u2019s too late. I did not appreciate your grandfather as much as I should until he passed away. But I\u2019m very happy he left me your mother.\u201d What strikes me is not how times or technology have changed, but how strong this woman is. If someone asks me about my life at 87, I hope I have so much to say. Rowan Hisayo Buchanan\u2019s novel Harmless Like You is published by Sceptre at \u00a314.99 \u2018My grandmother walked to school barefoot in Fiji\u2019     George Shankar with his grandparents Ram and Sarla. Photograph: Freya Najade for the Guardian    George Shankar, 23, was born in the UK. His grandparents, Sarla, 75, and Ram, 92, moved to England from their birthplace, Fiji, with his infant father and uncle in 1961. Sitting forward in his grey leather recliner, my aaja (grandfather) looks at me with almost boyish excitement. At 92, he has seen and done a lot and now he carefully chooses the moments when he wants to speak. Talking about life in Fiji, though, his exuberance returns. A smile plays on his lips as he tells me about my oldest uncle\u2019s birth. \u201cI used to go fishing every weekend. Your aaji [grandmother] was expecting Joey in 10 days\u2019 time and she kept telling me, \u2018Don\u2019t go this weekend, don\u2019t go. I think he will come when you\u2019re away.\u2019\u201d Aaji frowns, as if the story still annoys her 57 years on. He continues: \u201cI was fishing when he was born, would you believe it? \u201cHe turns his face to his shoes in mock penitence and laughs. \u201cI will never live that down.\u201d After a pause, Aaja lifts himself out of his chair and makes to leave the room. My grandma notices his high-waisted chinos are getting loose. \u201cYou have to put a belt on and wear your trousers a little farther down.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause you hike them up too much!\u201d My grandparents were both born under British colonial rule in Fiji. (Aaji and Aaja are Fiji Hindi for your father\u2019s parents.) They grew up on sugarcane farms, the children of indentured labourers from India. Their childhood couldn\u2019t have been more different from mine. I grew up in suburban Kent and went to grammar school, then straight to university; the only farming I\u2019ve ever done was during my gap year in Costa Rica, and I chose to do it. Aaji and I go to the kitchen to start preparing dinner. She moves around the kitchen with the grace of an experienced chef. She puts cloves and cinnamon in a pot with oil, adds onion, turmeric, paprika and her own blend of garam masala. Nothing is measured. I stir the spices in the pot. \u201cAt the age of 11, I was cooking for a lot of people,\u201d she says. \u201cI was watching like a hawk \u2013 just like you are doing now.\u201d She tells me that she used to wake up at 5am and cook breakfast for her whole family under a paraffin lamp. When I was small, my cousins and I would stand on a chair to help her make roti flatbreads. But when our grandparents bought a computer, we started playing Age Of Empires and stopped cooking roti. \u201cYour generation is spoilt with material things,\u201d Aaji says. \u201cWe used to make our own toys out of sticks and cloth. The first time we saw a gramophone or a radio, it was as though a miracle had happened.\u201d After preparing the chicken, I ask my grandparents to tell me about their school years. Aaji still bears a grudge against the teacher who prevented her from studying beyond middle school. Meanwhile, Aaja, studying to be a dentist, was moved around from Fiji to New Zealand, India and finally to Edinburgh on a Commonwealth scheme, before returning to Fiji. That\u2019s when he met Aaji. They settled on the north coast of Vanua Levu, Fiji\u2019s second largest island. They were poor: Aaja worked with pedal-powered instruments and people paid him with chickens and vegetables.    We used to make our own toys out of sticks and cloth    \u201cWhen we had the two boys, Atul and Joey, we had to decide,\u201d says Aaja. \u201cWe thought, \u2018We\u2019re never going to bring them up here, because they\u2019ll never get a good education.\u2019 There and then we decided to leave and came straight to the UK.\u201d Was it hard being immigrants in the 1960s? \u201cWe weren\u2019t immigrants,\u201d Aaji says. \u201cWe were British citizens. We were always British by birth, so although we were taught a lot of things about India, we never looked at it that way.\u201d They moved to London, made friends and set up a dental practice. Aaji adds: \u201cMy life began here, and we assimilated very well. Nobody called us names.\u201d I remember some of my dad\u2019s stories from his schooldays, and think perhaps Aaji is holding something back. While I don\u2019t remember any specific incidents of racism growing up, I was always distinctly aware that I was one of the only brown kids in school.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s why my parents took me and my sister to Fiji just after I finished my GCSEs. We met up with Aaji, who took us all to the school she went to when she was a girl; she used to walk there barefoot from the bus stop. Talking now, Aaji and I realise we are more alike than we knew. She was a second-generation immigrant in Fiji, just as I am in the UK. We\u2019re sensitive, opinionated; neither of us likes to admit when we\u2019re wrong. Above all, though, we\u2019re protective of our family; we both know how much they have shaped us. As Aaji looks at the photos that crowd the living room \u2013 her brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren and great-grandchild \u2013 she says: \u201cThat is the most important thing. Family.\u201d \u2018On the buses, they would chant, \u201cEnoch, Enoch, Enoch.\u201d It was terrible\u2019     Tenata Cuff and granddaughter Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff. Photograph: Freya Najade for the Guardian    Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, 23, was born in London and grew up in Edinburgh with her mother, father and her mother\u2019s twin sister. Teneta Cuff, 75, is her maternal grandmother, born in the parish of Saint Ann, Jamaica. \u201cWhen I first got off the plane I thought the country was filled with factories,\u201d my nanny laughs, \u201cThe smoke was high, high. But it was just chimneys.\u201d We\u2019re sitting in her house in St Albans, getting to know each other after many years of estrangement. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown woman,\u201d she scolds. \u201cYou should come visit your nanny. It doesn\u2019t take much to pick up the phone.\u201d Perched on a gold bed cover, she takes out a pink velveteen sack from her dresser and pours its contents on to the bed. Among pamphlets from relatives\u2019 funerals and old pictures, she finds it: the British-Jamaican passport she used when she moved to the UK. In the photo she looks happy and pretty: afro pinned back, small nose and wide mouth, wearing a spotty blouse and a coin necklace. I had always known my nanny, now 75, had left for England as part of the Windrush generation, the influx of immigrants who came to the UK from Caribbean Commonwealth countries in the mid-20th century. But, despite pressing my own mother for stories, I hadn\u2019t heard Nanny\u2019s memories of the move. She arrived at Birmingham airport on 5 October 1960. \u201cI left my parents behind, because they were too old,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I had four uncles here, and Uncle Appy said he was going to pick me up and I would stay with him. But when I came, he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cWere you scared?\u201d I ask. \u201cI wasn\u2019t, because I was with a group of girls,\u201d Nanny says. \u201cMy friend\u2019s brother-in-law had to go up and tell my relatives where I was after we were dropped off in Wolverhampton. I\u2019ll never forget his kindness in letting me stay the night. It turned out my uncle had been in hospital.\u201d A thread runs through our conversation: the importance of community and family, and how easily it\u2019s lost. Perhaps it\u2019s because, since my family moved up to Scotland when I was eight, I have only seen Nanny twice: once, aged 13, after the death of my paternal grandfather, and a second time last month, aged 22. Or perhaps it\u2019s that she has seen a lot of death (her husband, George Cuff, died before I was born), along with the steady decline of the Jamaican community in the UK. In 2001, the Caribbean population outnumbered Africans, but there has been a significant reversal due to mixed-race relationships (43% of British black Caribbean people were in a mixed-race relationship, compared with 22% of British black Africans in 2011) and lower rates of migration.

Photograph: Freya Najade for the Guardian    \u201cHe was a nice, kind man,\u201d Nanny says of George. \u201cHe always made sure he had sweets in his pockets for the children. When he came to the house, he would check them, and if the sweets weren\u2019t there, he would go straight back out again to buy some.\u201d Nanny and George, who met soon after she arrived, had four children in quick succession: the twins (my mother Jacqui and Auntie Pauline) in 1962, when Nanny was 21, after which they married; Sonja in January 1964; and George in December of the same year. \u201cHe always treated me right. When I was in hospital with the twins, he came and gave me Christmas money,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were a surprise, even though I was huge. They were tiny \u2013 2lb 10oz and 2lb 13oz, and in an incubator for months.\u201d     Charlie\u2019s mother Jacqui and her twin sister, Pauline. Photograph: Freya Najade for the Guardian    George had two other children back at home in the parish of Saint Elizabeth. He came over to the UK for work and found a job on the buses. When the children were still young, Nanny decided to join him, getting a job as a conductor in 1965. \u201cI dashed out to sit the test while he was at work, and when he came back, I said to him, \u2018I\u2019ve got a job, you know\u2019, and he asked me, \u2018What are you going to do with the children?\u2019 I told him, \u2018They\u2019re not mine, they\u2019re yours,\u2019\u201d she laughs. It was while working on the buses that she experienced racism. She tells me she was sometimes afraid of big, burly white men who didn\u2019t pay for their tickets and sat on the top deck. In 1968, Enoch Powell\u2019s Rivers of Blood speech inflamed national prejudices. \u201cOn the buses, they would chant, \u2018Enoch, Enoch, Enoch.\u2019 It was terrible,\u201d Nanny says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get myself involved \u2013 I would just do my job.\u201d I\u2019ve brought her a copy of gal-dem, the magazine by women of colour that I work on; we often write about our experiences of racism. She flicks through it, and tells me she thinks things are much better now. I leave her house with promises to visit and call more often. She\u2019s my only living grandparent, so the obligation is there, but now that I\u2019ve learned more about her life, I feel more comfortable about going to see her again. Getting to know your family can be like an ointment, I know now, soothing wounds and identity crises. I\u2019m glad to have her back. \u2018At an age when I was celebrating my barmitzvah, he was enduring a succession of concentration camps\u2019     Darren Richman with his grandfather, Zigi Shipper. Photograph: Freya Najade for the Guardian    Darren Richman, 32, was born in the UK. His maternal grandfather, Zigi Shipper, 86, was born in Lodz, Poland. When my grandfather was 51, he suffered a massive coronary. My grandmother was told to prepare for the worst. She told the doctor, \u201cThe Nazis tried to kill my husband for five years and he survived that; I\u2019m not too worried about this.\u201d On his next birthday, he\u2019ll turn 87. Grandpa Zigi, as he\u2019s affectionately referred to by just about everyone, was born to Jewish parents in 1930 in Lodz, Poland. Between 1940 and 1945, at an age when I was playing with friends and celebrating my barmitzvah, he was enduring hell on earth at a succession of concentration camps. Auschwitz never felt like textbook history at school, because this genial, optimistic man, a huge part of my life, had survived it. When I pop in to see him at his bungalow, undoubtedly the last home I\u2019ll visit without Wi-Fi, Zigi starts chatting away immediately: \u201cDo you know how long making a cup of tea used to take? How can people complain about things changing?\u201d I ask whether he ever feels envious of my generation: \u201cNot at all. It makes me feel so great to see my children, my grandchildren, the education they had. To see the third generation doing so well makes me happier than anything. You are my revenge.\u201d I\u2019ve never felt entirely comfortable with the description of myself as \u201cthird generation\u201d. I\u2019m sometimes called not just a third-generation immigrant but a third-generation survivor. But it feels insulting to consider myself a survivor of anything. When, as a child, I was first informed that Zigi had been to a camp for Jews when he was my age, I genuinely assumed it was similar to the ones I went to with youth groups. I couldn\u2019t compute the reality of what I was being told and, to a large degree, I still can\u2019t.    I had enough to eat and room where to sleep \u2013 why should I complain?    Yet the man before me, who witnessed first-hand some of the most horrific events of the last century, feels he has had a great life: \u201cI had enough to eat and room where to sleep \u2013 why should I complain?\u201d Seventy years in the country and his English might not be perfect, but the sentiment is. I ask what he makes of my decisions, such as the peripatetic nature of my work (writing about films and football), compared with his own half-century spent running a stationery shop. He\u2019s sanguine: \u201cDo whatever makes you happy. Life is too short.\u201d One surprising difference between us is our attitude towards Jewish dietary laws. Zigi was brought up in an extremely religious household, yet his experiences changed his attitude towards food. He loathes anyone in the family using the word \u201cstarving\u201d to denote hunger, and will eat just about anything. Despite being agnostic at best, I avoid pig and seafood \u2013 a superstitious hangover from my younger days, and one I seem unwilling or unable to shake. When I ask about God, he\u2019s diplomatic: \u201cI don\u2019t know one way or another. But at my age, it\u2019s probably best to keep Him on side, just in case.\u201d I share little of Zigi\u2019s optimism. Discovering an absence of milk in the fridge is enough to convince me the world is about to end. In July this year, my first child was born eight weeks early and spent the first few weeks of his life in intensive care. Fortunately, our son showed some of his great-grandfather\u2019s survival instinct and he\u2019s home now. The Nazis tried to reduce my grandfather to no more than a number: 84303. They didn\u2019t quite manage that, nor could they rob him of a family.

But Sweden normally gets the gold star. One of the first countries to implement a heavy tax on fossil fuels in 1991, it now sources almost half its electricity from renewable resources. The ruling coalition (Green and Social Democrat) has just announced plans to slash VAT on repairs to bicycles, clothes and shoes from 25% to 12%, in a big effort to drive sustainability. No wonder Swedes are regularly touted as the most sustainable nation. The only problem is, it\u2019s not necessarily true according to Johan Rockstrom of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, someone who knows who is, and isn\u2019t, overstepping the mark Rockstrom points to the fact that the much praised Swedish psyche that prizes responsibility doesn\u2019t actually add up to impressively low emissions. Two years ago, a World Wide Fund for Nature survey of ecological performance from 152 countries placed Sweden in the bottom 10 (ahead of the UK and behind Kuwait, that came first). Rockstrom confirms what other economists and sustainability experts have suggested: wealthy Swedes are bumping up their carbon footprint with endless holidays. Meanwhile the nation remains dependent on imports (with a lot of embodied carbon). It\u2019s not easy being green, or a Swede, and not at all easy being a green Swede.

Taiwan was very similar, we found a lot of similarities in our cultures,\u201d Simon tells Guardian Australia. \u201cLike, they couldn\u2019t talk to their sisters, and we can\u2019t talk to our sisters or mothers-in-law.

The band got everyone up and dancing at the festival, despite warnings that Taipei crowds might be a little less active, says Louise Partos, executive director of touring agency Artback NT. And there was a great connection with smaller indigenous communities that they visited in the days after the festival, where \u201cpeople got up and danced straight away\u201d. \u201cBoth B2M and that community performed their welcome songs and dances and thank you songs and dances. It was just beautiful to see how linked those communities were in terms of ceremonial practices and respecting each other,\u201d Partos says. \u201cThere was a building of relationships and a recognition of oneness that I hadn\u2019t expected.\u201d The Taiwan trip inspired B2M\u2019s new venture, Project Songlines, which involves mixing traditional ancient Tiwi chants with those of other indigenous cultures.

But Simon says \u201cthey\u2019re all for it\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see they understand that for our culture to survive in the new world it needs to be recorded and passed down in a different way. And from what we heard in Taiwan it\u2019s very similar there. But they are so into it, and very excited about it.\u201d B2M\u2019s positive messages around drugs and alcohol are nevertheless very important to them. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge problem, and not just for us,\u201d said Simon. \u201cHopefully someone can take over or pick up on it, because there needs to be songs about that on mainstream radio.\u201d   Related: Warumpi Band\u2019s Sammy Butcher: from Indigenous rock\u2019s young gun to its elder statesman    The band has a big following, particularly among Indigenous Australian communities, and feels a responsibility to the younger generations. \u201cWe\u2019re all fathers in the band, and kids are our main passion,\u201d says Simon. \u201cBack in 2004 there was time when we almost broke up but the kids are the ones that kept us going.

One book may not sound like much but it is in Maerdy, a former coalmining village along the main road that snakes up the Rhondda Fach valley, where a good house can be had for less than \u00a330,000. Ferndale has a lot riding on it. Local government spending cuts saw the school take over running the local library and swimming pool, to keep them open. And Nicholas is about to meet officials to discuss what more the school can do when the area\u2019s generous EU funding disappears, post-Brexit. But right now Ferndale carries even more weight for Wales\u2019s educational reputation, as one of the schools chosen to take part in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s triennial Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa), which tests core skills in maths, literacy and science.   Related: UK students stuck in educational doldrums, OECD study finds    Last year Ferndale\u2019s 15-year-olds sat the Pisa exams alongside half a million of their peers in 72 countries. The results will be published on 6 December. Governments worldwide use Pisa as the litmus test for their schools. It was Pisa that highlighted Finland\u2019s remarkable success within Europe, and then Shanghai\u2019s table-topping performance as a sign of China\u2019s development. In Wales there is concern about the latest set of results. While England\u2019s and Scotland\u2019s scores have been largely static, although slipping down international rankings because of new participants, Wales has seen its scores decline over the past decade, compounded by poor recent A-level results. Philip Dixon, a former director of the ATL Cymru teaching union, says Wales\u2019s poor Pisa results upended many assumptions about the world-class quality of its education system since devolution. \u201cPisa isn\u2019t perfect, but for all its faults it gives a reality check to governments. Being a small country, and not having a lot of checks and balances, we were a bit cocooned,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cWhen the first lot of Pisa results landed in 2007, there was consternation. And then when the second set arrived in 2010, which showed not only that we still weren\u2019t remotely near the best but that we were actually going backwards, that caused a tremendous shock.\u201d According to Dixon \u2013 who has just published a book on the subject entitled Testing Times \u2013 the cause was a \u201clost decade\u201d, in which Wales failed to upgrade its teaching or introduce prescriptive strategies for teaching such as those seen in Scotland or England.   Related: Wales A-level results raise concerns pupils falling behind rest of UK    The successive poor Pisa results set off alarms among policymakers in Cardiff, spearheaded by Leighton Andrews, Wales\u2019s minister for education from 2009 to 2013. \u201cThere were two options really,\u201d says Andrews. \u201cOne was to go into denial; the other was to say: this has got to be a turning point. And we obviously took the latter course.\u201d He recalls the Pisa results published in 2010: \u201cIt became the trigger for our school improvement programme, which kicked off in early 2011.\u201d First came banding, ranking schools into five levels of effectiveness, followed by new numeracy and literacy tests and frameworks, a new master\u2019s degree for newly qualified teachers, and efforts to amalgamate the 22 disparate and sometimes tiny local authorities responsible for school improvement. The 2013 results, published in 2014, saw Wales again lose ground in science and, in particular, maths, where its Pisa score fell further behind Scotland and England and slipped to 43rd in the international standings. But Andrews says the reforms introduced since 2011 have not yet had time to take hold, and so won\u2019t be reflected in the latest set of results. \u201cThe key question is whether you allow the policies you\u2019ve introduced to continue and to embed, or whether you twist and turn every time there is a problem,\u201d he says. Kirsty Williams, Wales\u2019s current education minister, has been in the job only since May, and is the lone Liberal Democrat in Cardiff\u2019s Labour-dominated government. But she agrees that the earlier reforms need more time to take effect \u2013 including the introduction of the pupil deprivation grant she championed, which funds schools directly for disadvantaged children, similar to the pupil premium in England.     Ferndale\u2019s head, Heather Nicholas, says Pisa has spurred Welsh schools to improve. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures    Whatever this year\u2019s Pisa results, Williams argues there is widespread support in Wales for reforming its education system, and points out the improvement in GCSE results seen this year. \u201cI believe we are in a better position than we have been in a long time. I think things are on the up in Wales \u2013 I detect an absolute commitment from parents, from educators, from our higher education institutions. It\u2019s a national mission. \u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that after all these years of devolution there\u2019s a disappointment that Welsh education isn\u2019t where we would want it to be. But there is a new sense of purpose, a collective understanding of what we need to do to move forward. There are some outstanding teachers, but we need make sure that quality is consistent no matter where you live in Wales, or what your background is.\u201d Williams\u2019s sense of a national mission is shared by Heather Nicholas at Ferndale. \u201cThe honest truth is, we\u2019ve not been doing well in Pisa. But I think it\u2019s generated a surge of support for improving the education process, and I think Kirsty Williams will find life a bit easier than Leighton Andrews when he first started, in that she\u2019s pushing at an open door now. \u201cI liaise with a lot of heads, and there are gripes and groans because it is quite high pressure and it\u2019s long hours. But there is a feeling that everyone is in it together,\u201d says Nicholas. In Maerdy, where the town\u2019s terraced houses can hide the deprivation behind their doors, that support often comes through the school. Nicholas talks of home visits, \u201cwith loving parents and a loving family but really deprived. Concrete floors, no white goods, no heating, children topping and tailing in beds. It\u2019s like the 1940s. It\u2019s much more commonplace than you would know.\u201d     Ferndale is in a former coalmining village, where unemployment is high. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena Pictures    The foyer of the school has a large photo of a coalmine. The caption reads: \u201cMardy Colliery \u2013 the last pit in the Rhondda (sunk 1875, closed 21 December 1990)\u201d. It\u2019s a grim reminder for a school in an area with high long-term unemployment, where 40% of its pupils receive free school meals and a substantial number have been in care. But while the mines are long gone, Ferndale has set to work polishing diamonds. Elsewhere in the foyer are happier news clippings that speak of record-breaking exam results and new achievements. Since Nicholas took over as head five years ago, she and her staff have taken Ferndale from the bottom of the Welsh government\u2019s five bands to the top. In summer 2016 the school celebrated 55% of its pupils getting five good GCSE passes, including English or Welsh and maths, compared with just 22% in 2010. A new system of discipline has seen exclusions fall and attendance rise, year on year. Now the school is buzzing thanks to a partnership with Google, bringing Silicon Valley technology to the Rhondda valleys, and it is soon to be the subject of a BBC documentary.   Related: Global school tests under attack as OECD accused of killing 'joy of learning'    One of Nicholas\u2019s innovations has been a \u201cFerndale promise\u201d: no matter what a child\u2019s background, says Nicholas, \u201cby the time they have left this school, they will have had a residential visit, they will have travelled abroad, if they want to\u201d. In return, pupils are expected to raise funds through sponsorship, or take part in tasks around school such as collecting litter. The promise extends to making sure every pupil has school uniform, and if they don\u2019t have a book, the school makes sure they are given one. It also runs two children\u2019s centres, engages parents and holds classes for adult learners. One overlooked detail from the last Pisa report was that pupils in Wales reported being happier than other parts of the UK. \u201cIf you picked any child out here and asked: \u2018what\u2019s the best thing about this school?\u2019, even the most grumpy, most truculent, if pressed, would say it\u2019s the sense of family, of care,\u201d Nicholas says. What is Pisa? (No, not that Pisa) The Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) is a set of test results published every three years by the OECD, with the aim of evaluating different education systems. Students aged 15 in randomly selected schools are tested on reading, maths and science. The results are widely reported and pored over across the world. The last Pisa results, assessing students in 65 countries, were published in 2013 and focused on maths. This year\u2019s results, expected on 6 December, will focus on science. The tests have become increasingly controversial. Some experts argue they encourage countries to engage in short-term fixes and to focus on a narrow curriculum and more standardised testing to climb the rankings. \u201cLack of progress on Pisa has led to declarations of crisis and \u2018Pisa shock\u2019 in many countries,\u201d wrote a panel of academics from around the world in an open letter to Andreas Schleicher, director of education for the OECD, in 2014. Others have complained it is not right to compare systems using average scores from random schools, and also that cultural differences make the tests unfair. French students, for example, are reportedly reluctant to guess multiple choice responses, preferring to leave a question blank \u2013 even though by guessing they would have had a 25% chance of being right. In addition, questions translated into different languages can be easily misinterpreted. There has also been criticism of Pisa, along with other international comparisons, for excluding children with disabilities.   Related: The Pisa methodology: do its education claims stack up?    Top performers in the last Pisa tables were Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore. Finland has been a consistent high performer since the tests began, though it slipped in the last round. The UK\u2019s results have been less than stellar. In the last round (tested in 2012 and reported in 2013) England was 21st out of 65 for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for maths. The UK as a whole came 26th in maths, 20th in science and 23rd in reading. In maths, Scotland ranked slightly higher than England. Northern Ireland was seven places further down the table and Wales was 12th from the bottom, 17 places behind England.

They rarely break out into global activity by themselves. Cities participate in collective movements or networks to take advantage of new conditions, and often their demise or withdrawal from a global orientation is also experienced jointly with other cities as circumstances change, affecting many at once. The world\u2019s first great market-driven cities were established more than 4,000 years ago in the early bronze age, and their rich history is only now beginning to be understood. An urban revolution was taking place, with most residents of what is today southern Iraq living in cities, and this process of urbanisation was accompanied by trade on a new scale. Farther east, the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, in modern-day Pakistan along the Indus River valley, were among the first cities with diversified economies and societies. They were located on trade routes that specialised in gemstones and spanned the whole of central Asia.   Related: The story of cities, part 1: how Alexandria laid foundations for the modern world    These cities formed the epicentre of a vast trade network based on a common cultural and linguistic community, and built infrastructure to provide good standards of living for residents. With their deep-rooted cultures and external orientation, they exhibited many of the hallmarks of what are now considered to be global cities. One important lesson to be drawn from the early waves of urbanisation and the long distance activities of cities is that prized assets and luxury possessions have often been drivers of interconnection and collaboration. As China began to expand its horizons, the trade in horses, silk, bamboo, rice and wine was vigorous and often used in diplomacy to guarantee peace between empires and cities. Silk even became an international currency. Within a few hundred years, the world had been effectively shrunk by the growing sophistication of the trade network. As historian Peter Frankopan, author of The Silk Roads, notes: \u201cWe think of globalisation as a uniquely modern phenomenon, yet 2,000 years ago it was a fact of life \u2013 one that presented opportunities, created problems, and prompted technological advance.\u201d The first European city to develop networks akin to those of a modern global city was Rome. Its empire came to consist of a federation of cities \u2013 stretching from Spain and Scotland in the west, to the Euphrates river in the east \u2013 each of which had a territory attached. Rome provided the administration, the stability, the monetary regime, and the tax structure for cities to thrive amid a huge spike in population mobility and mercantile activity.     Video by Max Galka   By the mid-Roman era, most contemporaneous historians perceived the world to have been globalised. Polybius in his Histories remarked that \u201cfrom this point onwards history becomes an organic whole: the affairs of Italy and Africa are connected with those of Asia and of Greece, and all events bear a relationship and contribute to a single end.\u201d Among the lasting features of this wave of globalisation of trading cities was a much larger and more diverse trading of goods across continents. This trade fuelled a new commercial zone in the Indian Ocean and direct trade with India. The Roman urban network also helped spread religion, and cities in the Roman system later became centres of Christian authority. This era was perhaps the first time that one city\u2019s power and influence became the fundamental driver of intercontinental trade.  But while the rise and fall of Rome as a global city is well documented, others have resumed global roles whenever the geopolitical opportunity has presented itself.  Istanbul, for example, has experienced many cycles of global exchange over the last two millennia because of its unique strategic location as a bridge between Europe and Asia. Formerly named Byzantium, the city was transformed by Emperor Constantine in the fourth century AD and renamed Constantinople because it was close to Rome\u2019s economic and political interests in the eastern empire.     Contemporary historians of the mid-Roman era believed that the word had been globalised. Photograph: Andrew Medichini/AP    Roman leaders needed an open city located close to Rome\u2019s supply market along the Silk Roads, across the Black Sea, through rich Anatolia and into the wheat producing areas of the Nile. As a result, Constantinople assumed command and control functions, and drew ambitious Roman citizens and traders from around the world. As a cultural melting pot, Constantinople facilitated the spread of Christianity across the Roman Empire. Despite the collapse of the western Roman empire, Constantinople later resumed its role as a vibrant trade hub in the eighth and ninth centuries. Under a tight system of state control over factories, workshops, wages and tariffs, the city processed trade from Russia, India, China and Africa, with merchants attracted by its gold and silk commodities. It transported goods to and from Venice, Pisa, Genoa and all over Europe, and at one point is said to have been home to 60,000 Italians. Much later, under the Ottomans, Constantinople became Istanbul. Its leaders grasped the new opportunities of European trade and actively invited the intelligentsia of the Islamic world. While Istanbul\u2019s influence has waxed and waned, its strategic position has repeatedly proved an asset to outward-looking leaders, and has created an enduring appeal to immigrant entrepreneurs and innovators. Europe\u2019s commercial wave A new wave of cities developing international roles took place in the 11th and 12th centuries, as part of what is sometimes called the \u201ccommercial revolution\u201d. As population and urbanisation grew, a two-pronged system of cities emerged: the lucrative trade in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea of Europe was gathering pace in some, while many Italian city-states were becoming prosperous through shipping, commerce and banking. This was a time when many systems of rule and governance coexisted. As cities grew, they became independent or semi-autonomous entities with their own military capability. This wave of globalisation was also characterised by a powerful merchant class that dominated the market economy and had an active role in city leadership.

Illustration: De Agostini Picture Library/Getty Images    Italian cities took advantage of geopolitical opportunity during the Crusades to expand their trading and banking services for the military campaigns. Venice in particular gained privileges in the Byzantine empire and extended relations with the pope. With Italian success came influence. By the late 1200s, Florence and Genoa were minting gold coins, and Florence\u2019s own currency became dominant in European commercial and financial markets. This wave marked the first time that so many regions and religions had come into sustained contact. In her book Before European Hegemony, sociologist Janet Abu-Lughod identified eight regional circuits in operation, stretching from north-western Europe all the way to modern-day Malaysia and Philippines. It was also a time in which cities achieved great cultural, artistic and intellectual advances, spawning both trade and knowledge exchange. The circuits Abu-Lughod described thus fostered interregional contact through cultural gateway cities such as Venice in the west and Malacca in the east. In between, the geopolitical opportunity for peace after the 13th-century Mongol invasions was also a catalyst for ports and caravan cities in the Middle East to develop and globalise.     The Blue Mosque in Tabriz, once described as the most cosmopolitan city in the world. Photograph: Alamy    One example was Tabriz, in modern-day Iran, which attracted a large number of European merchants and was described as the most cosmopolitan city in the world in the 13th century. It specialised in gold and silk cloth-weaving, and in trade in precious stones. Five hundred years later, the city was still noted for its independent merchant class. The Black Death devastated many of the leading cities in this wave, but the advanced network of the Hanseatic League and the globalising cities in southern Europe endured into the 15th century, brought together by a shared desire to conduct free trade. This wave is thus often seen as vital to the later spread and success of modern capitalism. The post-Columbus wave Beginning in around 1500, cities that had globalised in the previous wave began experiencing multiple and long-lasting setbacks. Agriculture was earning diminishing returns, and religious warfare gripped many cities. Italian and Iberian cities began to experience deindustrialisation, uncompetitive wages, and loss of market share to cities in the east. A shift in favour of northern European cities began to take place. Globalisation had taken on new characteristics, with new roles for cities in a system where sovereign states were stamping their authority. Advances in map-making and ship-building helped improve communications and reduce transaction costs for cities. One change was in the nature of consumption: a new class of consumers appeared with a shared goal to signal position and status, driving major growth in production and retail sectors.  Gradually a much better connectivity emerged, characterised by an enlarged and integrated global market, new notions of a single world, and a sense of cosmopolitan identity. Northern European cities profited the most from this wave of globalisation. At this point, the beginnings of what became known as the \u201cgreat divergence\u201d between Europe and Asia appeared. Many arguments have been put forward to explain it. One factor was that merchants and bankers in northern European cities were able to protect their investments by legal means and to separate their capital from personal risk, which was not possible in Asian cities. A higher pace of urban growth, greater self-government for cities, and a strong trade focus in urban public policy have all also been suggested as key factors explaining the divergence. European cities are often described as the globalising cities of this era, but Islamic conquests were also enabling a new group of cities to go global. From the early 1500s, northern Indian cities in particular were brought into a vast Muslim sphere of influence under the Mughal empire.     English grandee rides in an Indian procession, \u2018Company Style\u2019 (East India Company). Illustration: Universal Images Group/Getty Images    The unification of commercial practices, common customs and beliefs allowed cities such as Delhi to become tightly integrated into Eurasian trade routes, especially for the export of textiles. Ahmedabad and Agra also thrived, aided by factory investment from the English East India Company \u2013 and, along with Delhi, reached a peak population of 400,000 people. Meanwhile Surat, nearly 200 miles north of Mumbai, became possibly the world\u2019s largest port, home to 150,000 people and at one point the richest city in India. Many assessments place these Indian cities\u2019 output at least on a par with leading European centres of the time \u2013 of which Antwerp and Amsterdam stand out as the two foremost world cities in continental Europe during this wave of globalisation. Antwerp rose to prominence by cannily exploiting its gateway location at the heart of a rapidly expanding Habsburg empire. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 had weakened Venice and Genoa, and the Scheldt river made the city a gateway to navigable inland waterways reaching far into western Europe. When nearby Bruges\u2019 own port silted up, Antwerp\u2019s merchants made incremental gains in the wool and fabric trade, and Portuguese spices from the East Indies started passing through the port. By the mid-15th century, Antwerp had become a preferred trading hub between the Baltic, the North Sea, northern Italy, France, and the Holy Roman empire. A few decades later, the city\u2019s stock exchange and banking sector had become the largest in Europe. Antwerp benefited from geopolitical advantage when it was absorbed into the Spanish Hapsburg Empire. This gave the city privileged access to a large unified market, and it became an entry point for silver and other precious goods shipped from Spanish American possessions. At its height, 40% of the world\u2019s trade was channelled through Antwerp. It was Europe\u2019s truly global city, with an ambitious and enlightened merchant class. The phenomenal wealth generated saw urbanisation in the region reach 30%. The city\u2019s population peaked at 100,000 by the 1560s, but then the city suffered from Spanish insistence that Atlantic trade go through Seville \u2013 a way of diverting wealth to Spain. Entanglement in the Dutch revolt and religious conflicts saw the city sacked and repeatedly besieged. While it retained a merchant ethos, it never recovered its mantle as a global city, although its port is today resurgent.     In the late 15th century, Antwerp had built the largest financial centre in Europe. Photograph: Don McPhee for the Guardian    Amsterdam took over the mantle from Antwerp and Genoa as Europe\u2019s major commercial city during the 1600s, and it developed many of the technologies that underpin today\u2019s global cities. The overthrow of the Spanish elite, which had hampered the interests of powerful local merchants, granted more freedom to Dutch traders. Soon after, the blockade of Spanish Antwerp triggered a flight of capital and talented entrepreneurs to Amsterdam. The protestant city became prized for its safe port, political stability and access to inland waterways. It maximised its appeal by guaranteeing equal protection to all merchants, wherever they came from, while developing standardised institutional norms. A relaxed attitude toward interest-bearing loans spurred the development of modern finance in Amsterdam, including maritime insurance, making the city both the logistical hub and the trade financier of Europe. The establishment of the Dutch East India Company and a powerful navy helped Amsterdam secure control over trade routes and outposts as far away as Japan, Indonesia, India and the Americas. The city\u2019s shipbuilders pioneered new materials and produced cheap cargo vessels, which considerably lowered transport costs. Amsterdam gained sufficient leverage over supply chains to wage price wars, prioritising volumes over margins to eliminate weak competition and secure a monopoly over pepper, tea and sugar imports. The impact of European wars and the rise of British naval supremacy in the 18th century meant that London eventually took Amsterdam\u2019s mantle. However, much of the know-how and assets acquired during Amsterdam\u2019s era of supremacy remain relevant today. The industrial wave For many observers of urban history, the modern era of globalisation began with industrialisation, whose effects occurred at a pace and on a scale not previously seen. Although the globalisation of traded goods long preceded the industrial era, industrialisation really reshaped whole societies, not just the tastes of upper-income groups.     The trading post of the Dutch East India Company in Hooghly, now a district in west Bengal, 1665. Illustration: History Archive/Rex/Shutterstock    By this point in history, national governments had become much more effective at managing global trade and reducing the dangers involved in carrying it out, while transport was becoming ever more reliable. These were the preconditions for successive waves of cities to become substantially more global in their traded specialisations, to diversify their populations, and to increase their capacity for commercial innovation.   Related: Story of cities #9: Kingston, Jamaica \u2013 a city born of 'wickedness' and disaster    A turning point in globalisation occurred in the late 18th century owing to a confluence of geopolitics and technological innovation. The victory of Britain in the Seven Years\u2019 War enhanced British power in India, and a more comprehensive system of colonial government was installed. This situation favoured British industrial development, and in 1771 the first water-powered cotton spinning model was invented. At the same time, colonial disputes in North and Central America intensified. As a result, a new wave of cities globalised as part of the British Empire. The slave trade, managed from London, was undoubtedly critical in financing British imperialism and industrialisation, and cities such as Bridgetown, Barbados and Kingston, Jamaica became subject to the empire\u2019s needs. As the empire extended its reach east, Cape Town, Calcutta and Hong Kong all became globally engaged cities, with Calcutta (now Kolkata) subject to a system of mercantilism, while Hong Kong became an instrument for promoting free trade. In east Africa, Mombasa grew into an important trade entrep\u00f4t with strong maritime business links to India and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the long-distance caravan trade across east Africa. Another city that became open to global flows was Canton. The British empire likely had a greater impact on global cities than any of its rivals, and many of the cities enrolled in the imperial project remain highly influential actors on the global stage today. London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, Mumbai, Shanghai, Toronto, Cape Town and Boston each developed their global roles and reach within the British Empire.      During the 19th century, Manchester emerged as the world\u2019s first global industrial city. Photograph: The Art Archive/Rex/Shutterstock    Infrastructure connectivity was often the catalyst. One of the clearest examples of this was in New York. In 1825, a growth coalition between New York\u2019s city leaders and businesses began the construction of the Erie Canal, connecting the city to the Great Lakes and the US midwest. The availability of this water route resulted in a phenomenal surge in local manufacturing and trade and new financial and insurance industries supplying the growth of a young America. New York moved ahead of Philadelphia in financial power as a result of its enhanced connectivity. In Britain itself, cities such as Liverpool, Bristol and Birmingham prospered from having access to imperial markets and from the global reach they afforded. Manchester emerged as the world\u2019s first global industrial city, while London, the city at the centre of it all, surpassed Beijing\u2019s all-time population record, reaching two million by 1840. Across Europe, a wave of cities benefited from unprecedented urban growth and industrial expansion. The European cities that globalised in this wave had in common a specific set of assets: historical trading knowledge, locations on major rivers or seas, and the ready availability of natural resources such as coal, iron and water. Drawing on this asset base, places such as Bilbao, Bremen, Leipzig, Sheffield and Turin were able to build exceptional manufacturing economies, specialising in engineering, machine tools, ships and other industrial areas. They attracted a huge manufacturing labour force, and became pioneering cities in terms of their public services, education and civic institutions.  Economic globalisation expanded massively in the decades leading up to the first world war. One of the main groups of cities to globalise in this wave was in the United States. American cities became substantially differentiated and specialised at this time, with their own mix of industrial enterprises and the \u201csecond wave\u201d of immigration giving them very different social and cultural characters.     Two men survey the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge with Manhattan in the background, 1877. Photograph: Museum of the City of New York/Getty Images    New York specialised in advanced services and consumer products, Chicago became a centre for heavy industrial plants, while Los Angeles moved into oil and the creative industries. Diverse and entrepreneurial populations played an indispensable role: New York was the main US gateway for immigrant labor. Tens of millions of immigrants, mainly Europeans, came to the city, and many settled there in search of a better life, making New York a cosmopolitan city on a scale never previously seen. Infrastructure was a critical enabler for this wave of American city globalisation. The installation of canals, railroads, water systems, highways and sewerage systems helped to provide the conditions for a half-century of extraordinary growth. The postwar wave A major wave of cities taking on global roles unfolded in the aftermath of the second world war. Changing geopolitics and American investment support provided opportunities for many commercially minded cities to become highly specialised. Often benefiting from sound city leadership, cities in this wave of globalisation were successful in restoration and in planning ahead to avoid the worst in congestion.  Munich, Toronto and Tokyo are all prominent examples of cities in this wave. These cities were able to achieve intensive clustering and organisational modernisation in a supportive political environment among higher tiers of government. For this wave, it was key for corporate proficiency to partner with a strong knowledge platform in order to develop successful products for export. Cities in this wave of globalisation were prominent well into the mid-1970s, by which time they had acquired many of the core assets that make them competitive today. Although these cities have experienced slowdowns and setbacks in the last 25 years, they have successfully preserved a culture of knowledge and innovation to support specialisations with global reach.      Migrant workers on their day off in Singapore. Photograph: Tim Chong/Reuters    Perhaps the most remarkable example during this wave was Singapore, the only global city also to be a fully autonomous city-state. Prior to independence in 1965, Singapore\u2019s economic prospects were uncertain. Its traditional entrep\u00f4t trade industries had declined, manufacturing was stagnant, and housing and roads were in urgent need of modernization.   Related: Story of cities #27: Singapore \u2013 the most meticulously planned city in the world    But its first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, was not deterred by geographic limitations and immediately pursued a labour-intensive industrialisation policy that was open to overseas capital. Emphasis was placed on tax incentives for industrial investors, improved labour discipline, technical education and foreign expertise, in order to specialise in industrial technologies. Singapore immediately tried to build trade and connectivity roles by leveraging its position as a multilingual city, with links to east and west, and a strong western legal model. Since achieving global status, Singapore has continued to adapt to the global marketplace through state-led policies and programmes that encourage light manufacturing and high-tech research investment. Its economic development board and housing development board, in particular, have been able to leverage the scale of large public institutions to create effective systems at a citywide scale. The postwar wave of globalisation was also striking for the process of decolonisation, which saw many cities lose their imperial roles. In the past, many global cities fell along with the empires that spawned them. Indeed, for London, this period coincided with a challenging postwar process of deindustrialisation, port decline and outdated regulation in its stock exchange, banking and insurance sectors. Although London attracted immigrants from the Commonwealth diaspora, the city continued to lose population until the mid-1980s, when it resumed the journey toward becoming a quintessential global city. The IT-powered wave The decade after the 1973 oil crisis and the subsequent global slowdown was a period of great flux in the global economy. Older models became discredited and new ideas and solutions came to the fore. By the mid-1980s, a new wave of globalisation was under way, led initially by a small group of cities but with an increasing number of smaller cities also becoming globally engaged and globally oriented for the first time. For a small, elite group of financial centres, the mid-1980s started a wave of resurgence when these cities began to re-attract people, business and capital. London and New York began to reverse their population decline, and in London the 1986 \u201cBig Bang\u201d in financial services marked the start of a new generation of international banks and surrounding business services firms setting up shop.     The New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images    For Asian members of this group, such as Tokyo and Singapore, this wave was characterised by a more selective and tactical globalisation. It promoted internationalisation of financial and business sectors through liberalisation reforms, while also protecting against over-exposure to western cultural influences. In this wave of globalisation, cities also re-established themselves as information and media capitals in their respective regions. This period was notable for significant governance changes in some cities \u2013 such as the abolition and then the recreation of a metropolitan government system in London; the new \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy in Hong Kong, which sought to guarantee that it would maintain a capitalist system for 50 years after the 1997 British handover to China; and the increasing withdrawal of federal government from its role in New York City.    Related: Story of cities #39: Shenzhen \u2013 from rural village to the world's largest megalopolis    At the same time, the new wave of globalisation was showcasing a set of cities that until then had not been globally oriented. The global geopolitical context had changed considerably as a result of the fall of communism in Europe, the unification of Germany, the opening up of China beginning in 1980, and the Oslo peace accords, part of the Arab-Israeli peace process, in 1993. The agreements of new trade arrangements \u2013 such as the European Economic Area and the North American Free Trade Association, and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in 1995 \u2013 ushered in an era of multilateralism that allowed many countries and cities to globalise. These factors created a climate of opportunity for the growth of leading cities in the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the smaller Mints (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey) economies, as well as in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Australasia. Among the most notable cities coming to global prominence in this wave were Bangalore, Barcelona, Cape Town, Sydney, and Tel Aviv.  New tradable specialisations associated with the information and communications technology revolution precipitated the unexpected globalisation of many cities. Bangalore is one of the most striking examples: its electronics specialisation took off in 1985 after the arrival of Texas Instruments. This prompted other multinational firms to relocate and boosted the local software design environment, laying the platform for successive climbs up the value chain.     The Infosys Technologies headquarters in Bangalore, India\u2019s tech hub. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images    Another striking example of innovation driving a city\u2019s globalisation in this wave comes from Tel Aviv. This young city\u2019s spirit of commerce and entrepreneurial capitalism translated into an open and horizontal concentration of skills in finance, optics, communications, information systems, medicine, and software. This strong technological base was reinforced by the Israeli military\u2019s investment in the city\u2019s advanced defence industries, which produced a regular flow of highly proficient talent. With its tech cluster benefiting from a supportive early stage investor arrangement and a positive attitude to risk, Tel Aviv is noted for its numerous tech inventions. The city\u2019s leadership has since sought to reinforce this global potential by emphasising Tel Aviv\u2019s pluralism, tolerance and investment readiness.  This wave of globalisation was distinctive for a more intentional approach by city governments and the rise of strategic planning for globalising cities. For cities like Barcelona and Tel Aviv, city governments designed strategic approaches to infrastructure, quality of life, and architecture in order to build a profile that would attract global talent. Many also converted their commercial land into use by more innovation-led activity. In nearly all cases, these cities witnessed an unprecedented wave of population diversification, fuelled by immigration and mobile talent. By the climax of this wave in 2007-8, these cities had a totally different global proposition \u2013 and new problems that had appeared alongside growth.  The current wave The most recent cycle of globalisation has seen the start of a new wave of distinctive, specialised and globally aspirational cities. Many of them are higher-income cities within their respective regions and seek to leverage their efficient infrastructure, improved quality of life, and better security and environmental performance compared to the larger megacities. Cities in this wave are less likely to have major political or institutional functions. Rather, they are competing in more dynamic and fast-moving global industries where opportunities have arisen for greater market share. Among this group are Brisbane, San Diego, Shenzhen, Santiago de Chile and Stockholm. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and its impact on public sector finances, the ability of cities to find new sources and tools for investment has been a key enabler for globalising cities since 2008. Brisbane is an example of a city that has been able to globalise with the help of a large and financially astute city government, which has used the surplus from its recent commodities boom to erect a more international model of economic development.      Brisbane has been helped to \u2018globalise\u2019 by support from local government. Photograph: Jeff Greenberg/UIG via Getty Images    The Brisbane city council has pursued a wide range of joint ventures, sponsored business conventions and sporting events, and convinced its state government to prioritise Brisbane for road and rail infrastructure funding. It has also experimented with public-private partnerships and toll roads, with some success. Much of the city\u2019s investment attractiveness owes to its reputation in Asia, where its ambassadors programme has boosted expatriate investment connections and reached out much more successfully to Chinese, Japanese and Malaysian commodities firms. The ability to attract a new generation of immigrants and entrepreneurs has been central to many cities\u2019 success in this wave. The ability to convey opportunity and appeal to the world, whether to talent, investors, or visitors, has also been very important. London is an example of a city that has been successful in this area since 2008. Through a unified organisation, London &amp; Partners, it has delivered a consistent message to the world that it is open for business and investment and has made substantial strides in becoming a city that welcomes new technology and science industries. In medicine, media, and digital industries, the ingredients of leading sector innovations, combined with an open city with deep labour markets and cosmopolitan liveability, have created a winning formula. The city\u2019s advocacy organisations have helped maintain its appeal by successfully lobbying for a competitive business and tax climate. Lessons for future cities A comparison of the waves of globalisation in the last two centuries with the earlier waves shows clearly that the duration of each wave is becoming shorter. Where waves once lasted a century or more, they now appear to run their course in as little as 15-to-20 years, and in the future this duration may be even shorter. As the global economy becomes ever more integrated, globalising city waves increasingly come to resemble global economic cycles, and the windows of opportunity for cities to participate close quickly. Although there are vast differences between the networks of cities along the ancient Silk Roads and the 21st-century system of global value chains and competitive advantage, there are also striking parallels. Today\u2019s cities can learn much from how those in previous waves built and sustained their competitive attributes, and how to avoid becoming locked into unsustainable or unproductive cycles of development.   Related: A history of cities in 50 buildings \u2013 interactive    Not all of today\u2019s leading cities were destined to play key roles in the global economy. Many started out from an unpromising or uncompetitive situation because of either internal weaknesses or external disadvantages. Sometimes cities have endured long periods of global isolation, and begin to internationalise only when geopolitical changes occur and foreign investment arrives. This was certainly the case in the 20th century, and in the 21st century it is visible in many other cities outside the established west. Equally, the ebb and flow of cities\u2019 fortunes means that some cities we take for granted today as global will likely be much less globally oriented in future. History shows this is a risk if cities lose competitiveness in traded sectors, fail to embrace innovation or to project influence, are closed to immigration and entrepreneurship, or are unable to adapt to a changing geopolitical or geoeconomic centre of gravity. The ingredients of today\u2019s most successful cities are sometimes hard for other cities to emulate directly, and so alternative strategies and pathways to global engagement have arisen.

Fake news and Russian interference \u2013 either by influencing fake news sites, or by hacking or misinformation \u2013 are viewed as a serious threat to the democratic process, particularly since the US presidential elections. From rumours that Merkel was in the east German secret police, the Stasi, to others suggesting she is Adolf Hitler\u2019s daughter, Germans are also proving themselves susceptible to false information.    Suspicions are that the story was spread by Russian elements keen to undermine the refugee policy of Angela Merkel    The most blatant example of fake news to hit Germany so far occurred earlier this year over reports that a 13-year-old girl of Russian origin, known as Lisa F, had been raped in Berlin by refugees from the Middle East. The story received extensive coverage on Russian and German media who reported the allegations that she had been abducted on her way to school and gang-raped. The attack turned out to have been fabricated, as Berlin\u2019s chief of police was quick to point out. According to Berlin\u2019s public prosecutor\u2019s office the girl had spent 30 hours with people known to her, and a medical examination proved she had not been raped. But having been shared widely on social media and through Russian news sites, hundreds took to the streets to protest at the \u201cattack\u201d, along with far right and anti-Islam groups. Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister went so far as to accuse Merkel\u2019s government of \u201csweeping the case under the carpet\u201d, heightening suspicions in Berlin that the Kremlin was deliberately trying to cause trouble. There are suspicions that the story was spread in the first place by Russian elements keen to undermine the refugee policy of Angela Merkel. She is viewed as a key enemy to Russia over her tough stance on Ukraine. The ultimate aim is said to be to destabilise her domestically just as she has said she will stand for a fourth term in office.     Some suspect the false story of a 13-year-old\u2019s rape by refugees was designed to undermine the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Photograph: Markus Schreiber/AP    In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen \u2013 the head of the BfV, Germany\u2019s domestic security agency, \u2013 accused Russia of using KGB-style techniques of misinformation. Addressing the Bundestag on the subject last week, Merkel said: \u201cToday we have fake sites, bots, trolls \u2013 things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms, and we have to learn to deal with them.\u201d Fake news has also spread to neighbouring Austria and been used to discredit both candidates in this weekend\u2019s presidential election. Most startling have been the attacks on the Green-backed independent candidate Alexander van der Bellen, whose opponents have attempted to spread the news that he is suffering from dementia and is gravely ill.  Kate Connolly France Over the last 10 years, France has seen a sharp increase in the readership of alternative, far-right sites, blogs and social media operations, referred to collectively as the fachosph\u00e8re \u2013 (\u201cfacho\u201d is slang for fascist). Promoting views including anti-immigration, nativism and ultra-nationalism, these sites are run independently, rather than by a political party. But they feed into a mood of distrust of the traditional media, both on the far right and the far left.   Related: How to solve Facebook's fake news problem: experts pitch their ideas    Samuel Laurent, head of Le Monde\u2019s fact-checking section, Les d\u00e9codeurs, said: \u201cIn France, there isn\u2019t a wide presence of totally invented fake news that makes money through advertising, as seen in the US.\u201d But he said France was seeing increasing cases of manipulation and distortion, particularly during election periods.  One example, in the recent primary race to choose the French right\u2019s presidential candidate, was a campaign on the fachosph\u00e8re to claim the centre-right candidate Alain Jupp\u00e9 was linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. The accusation dated back to local elections in 2014 when distorted stories circulated on a far-right opinion website, accusing Jupp\u00e9 of wanting to build a \u201cMosque-Cathedral\u201d in Bordeaux, where he is mayor. The story grew and was embellished during the primary campaigns to portray Jupp\u00e9 as a Muslim Brotherhood-linked \u201cAli Jupp\u00e9\u201d. Jupp\u00e9 said a \u201cdisgusting campaign\u201d had been run against him.  Laurent said: \u201cI think the French presidential election campaign [next spring] will be fraught with this type of thing.\u201d In January, as the presidential election campaign prepares to kick off, Le Monde\u2019s Les d\u00e9codeurs will launch a database of questionable sites that portray themselves as information sites.    I think the French presidential election campaign will be fraught with this type of thing  Samuel Laurent, head fact-checker for Le Monde     The recent Paris terrorist attacks were also subject to conspiracy theories and distortions, including reports this summer that gunmen who killed 90 people at a rock gig at the Bataclan last November had mutilated their victims. These reports cited partial evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the attacks, without adding that the inquiry also heard officials deny that any mutilation took place. There is also an ongoing row over fake information websites about abortion in France. The lower house of the French parliament has approved government plans to ban fake abortion information websites which masquerade as neutral, official sites with free-phone helpline numbers but which the government said promote anti-abortion propaganda and pressure women not to terminate pregnancies.     French women\u2019s minister, Laurence Rossignol, has spoken out about fake abortion information sites. Photograph: Patrick Kovarik/AFP/Getty Images    The women\u2019s minister, Laurence Rossignol, told parliament on Thursday that anti-abortion groups in France were setting up sites \u201cthat appear neutral and objective\u201d and copy official government information sites but were \u201cdeliberately seeking to trick women\u201d. She said these sites often had helplines run by \u201canti-choice activists with no training who want to make women feel guilty and discourage them from seeking an abortion.\u201d  Angelique Chrisafis  Myanmar A Burmese friend recently put it like this: in the old days, people went to the tea shop to get their news. Now, they go to Facebook. After decades of isolation under successive military regimes, Myanmar\u2019s 51 million people began to come online rapidly in 2014 after telecoms reforms. They leapfrogged the era of dial-up and desktops, starting with mobile phones and social media. For many, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. With scores of voices clamoring to be heard for the first time, it\u2019s a dynamic, sometimes dangerous space.    For many in Myanmar, Facebook is synonymous with the \u200binternet    As well as \u201c#foreveralone\u201d statuses and a barrage of updates from staunchly Facebook-first media organizations, news feeds are crammed with fake content. Much of it is tinged with religious hatred. With tensions between the majority Buddhist and minority Muslim populations running high, many are ready to believe vitriolic nonsense about Islam and its followers, often propagated by nationalist accounts set up for the purpose. A Muslim journalist was recently the victim of a campaign by some of these accounts, when a widely followed nationalist posted pictures of him juxtaposed with images of an unknown Rohingya Muslim militant. The post claimed he was involved in attacks on border police and called for his immediate arrest.  Nothing happened \u2013 the post was eventually taken down, though not before more than 3,000 people shared it. But the episode was a hint of the frightening power that fake news can have in a context like Myanmar.  Poppy McPherson Italy  In Italy, the spread of propaganda has become such a worry for the government that a top official in prime minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s circle of advisers recently filed a defamation complaint against a mystery Twitter account \u2013 it has since disappeared \u2013 who tweeted under the name \u201cBeatrice di Maio\u201d and routinely took aim at Renzi\u2019s government.  In one example, the Twitter account showed a picture of Elena Boschi, the reform minister, on the phone. It suggested she was sharing insider information with her father, who was a top executive at Banca Etruria, a Tuscan bank. The bank was rescued by the Italian government in 2015 but there is no evidence that Boschi helped her father or committed wrongdoing.      People supporting the \u2018no\u2019 side on the upcoming constitutional referendum take to the streets in Rome. Photograph: Pacific Pres/Rex/Shutterstock    In Italy the attacks against Renzi have been stepped up ahead of the critical 4 December referendum. In some cases, news about Italy reported by Russian state-controlled website RT Today has been especially skewed against the prime minister. In one case highlighted by La Stampa, the Italian daily, the Russian website falsely claimed that a rally in Rome held by supporters of Renzi ahead of the referendum were actually his opponents. The story has since been removed.  Members of Renzi\u2019s Democratic party have complained that \u201cmud-slinging\u201d websites controlled by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which abhors traditional political advertising, are to blame for spreading false and defamatory news about the government\u2019s activities.  Stephanie Kirchgaessner China As reports emerged that fake news had influenced the US presidential election, China trumpeted its system of a \u201cinternet management\u201d, portraying freedom of speech as broken when it can affect the outcome of an election.   Related: The pedlars of fake news are\u00a0corroding democracy | Andrew Smith    \u201cChina is on its way to strengthening internet management,\u201d said an editorial in the Global Times, a tabloid affiliated with the Communist party mouthpiece People\u2019s Daily. \u201cThe western democratic system appears to be unable to address\u201d the problems and conflict unleashed by the internet, the paper added. The fake news that spread on Facebook in the run-up to the election even spread to China. Articles originally posted on pro-Trump websites, including Breitbart, were directly translated into Chinese and shared on the country\u2019s social media platforms.  Problems with fake news and fraudulent reporters have existed for over a decade in China, with people often presenting themselves as journalists and threatening companies with negative coverage in an attempt to extort money. In one high-profile case, a journalist was paid more than $70,000 to write negative stories about a construction equipment manufacturing company, sending its shares tumbling. But the authorities have seized on the phenomenon as a justification to censor a wide-range of content. In 2013, the government launched a crackdown on online \u201crumour-mongering\u201d targeting influential users on the Twitter-like website Sina Weibo, but it was widely seen as an attempt to stem criticism of the ruling Communist party.    A journalist was paid more than $70,000 to write negative stories about a company, sending its shares tumbling    More recently, Chinese authorities have clamped down on \u201cfake news\u201d they feel harms social cohesiveness, targeting \u201crumours\u201d that affected property prices in Shanghai or stories the government says increase antagonism between urban and rural residents.  Earlier this year China\u2019s cyberspace administration issued new rules designed to curb the number of stories using information culled from social media, stating \u201cit is forbidden to use hearsay to create news or use conjecture and imagination to distort the facts\u201d. News outlets cannot use information posted on social media without prior approval, it said. More recently a top official at the administration suggested there should be a database to identify internet users\u2019 true identities so they could be \u201crewarded and punished\u201d. China maintains extensive control over the internet and many foreign websites, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube, are all blocked by a government program known as \u201cthe Great Firewall\u201d.  The country\u2019s vast censorship system that imposes media blackouts on topics ranging from missteps by China\u2019s leadership to investigating corruption cases. A recent directive banned websites from live streaming coverage of the US election. Benjamin Haas Brazil Brazil has a growing problem with fake news and its importance has grown as political opinion polarized following the close re-election victory of leftist president Dilma Rousseff in 2014 and her controversial impeachment in August this year. According to a BBC Brasil report from April 2016, as the impeachment process that Rousseff and her supporters called a politically motivated coup began heating up, three out of the five most shared news stories on Facebook were false.  A story shared by the Pensa Brasil (Think Brasil) site that falsely said that federal police wanted to know why Rousseff had given 30bn reais ($9bn) to the giant meat company Friboi came third in the ranking with 90,150 shares.  Last year Brazilian journalist Tai Nalon left her job at the Folha de S Paulo, one of Brazil\u2019s leading newspapers, to found the site Aos Fatos (To The Facts) \u2013 Brazil\u2019s first fact-checking site.     A report found three out of the five most shared stories on Facebook were false as the Dilma Rousseff impeachment process intensified. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters    \u201cThere is a lot of false news,\u201d Nalon said in an email interview, \u201cbut I would be cautious about saying the problem is similar to what happens in the USA\u201d. Instead, she said there are politically motivated pages that reinterpret and distort existing stories from big news outlets and that much of what they share is more biased opinion than pure falsehood. But plenty of false stories do circulate on Brazil\u2019s garrulous internet.  The two-year investigation into the Petrobras scandal, called Operation Car Wash, was a key driver in Rousseff\u2019s impeachment. Although she has never been accused of graft, many in her party have been and the scandal prompted huge street demonstrations calling for her removal. BuzzFeed Brasil this month published this story about how more false news about the operation has been published than real. This year, the 10 most popular false news stories about Car Wash were shared 3.9m times, BuzzFeed said, citing Facebook data. The 10 most popular real stories were shared 2.7m times. Dominic Phillips Australia Fake news is not a problem of any scale in Australia: the media market, dominated by a handful of key players serving a population of just over 21 million people, does not seem fragmented enough.    Concerns over halal certification \u2013 often failing to completely mask rampant Islamophobia \u2013 flourished on Facebook    But Australia is not immune to issues with untruths spreading on Facebook. Over half the population (13.3 million as at end of June) is connected to the internet; of that number, more than half is believed to be active on Facebook. Some issues seem to be more of a lightning rod for untruths in Australia than others. The link between the halal certification industry and terrorism \u2013 repeated by politicians despite a lack of evidence \u2013 was so persistent that an inquiry was held late last year. Concerns over halal certification \u2013 often failing to completely mask rampant Islamophobia \u2013 flourished on Facebook, even after the inquiry found there was no basis to the connection.     Parallels have been drawn between Pauline Hanson, a fringe rightwing political figure in Australia, and Trump\u2019s election. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP    The Boycott Halal in Australia group has close to 100,000 members on Facebook. In November 2014, it shared a satirical news article, apparently under the impression it was true. The post was subsequently deleted, but the page is a hotbed for views that have no basis in fact, as is the page for supporters of the Q Society, which bills itself as \u201cAustralia\u2019s leading Islam-critical movement\u201d.   Related: Facebook\u2019s failure: did fake news and polarized politics get Trump elected?    Pauline Hanson, a fringe figure in rightwing politics who is outspoken against Islam, was re-elected to the senate in the federal election in July with support that surprised many pundits. Her One Nation party took four seats in the 76-strong senate this year and the party is expected to do well in the Queensland state elections. Parallels have been drawn between her return to politics and Trump\u2019s election: both have embraced social media, where they have significant followings, and are similarly unfazed by evidence. In August, research showed 62% of voters agreed with the statement: \u201cI might not personally agree with everything she says but she is speaking for a lot of ordinary Australians.\u201d She is active on Facebook, as are many of her supporters. She recently announced that the majority of her press releases would be released only on Twitter.  Elle Hunt India After India\u2019s prime minister announced the introduction of a new, 2,000-rupee note last month, phones around the country lit up with the news the bill would come installed with a surveillance chip, linked to a satellite that could track the notes even 120 metres underground. The claims, debunked by the country\u2019s reserve bank, nonetheless spread like fire over Whatsapp \u2013 which has more than 50 million users in India \u2013 and migrated into mainstream news. As in the United States and elsewhere, increasing numbers of Indians are getting their news from social media.  But the 2,000-rupee episode illustrates the deeper impact of fake news in a country where media is prolific, but journalistic standards, especially in regional media, can still fall short.  \u201cMainstream media in India is more impacted by the phenomena [of fake news] because they broadcast these kinds of stories without verifying,\u201d says Prabhakar Kumar, from the Indian media research agency, CMS. \u201cThere is no standard policy for TV news and newspapers about the process of researching and publishing stories.\u201d Police have arrested people accused of concocting false stories, especially when they run the risk of igniting communal tension. Administrators of Whatsapp groups have been warned they could be held responsible for the messages they oversee.  But social media has only enabled a much older reliance on rumour and innuendo, especially in India\u2019s villages. Two boys in Dadri village, near Delhi, didn\u2019t need Whatsapp last year to spread rumours a local man was storing beef in his freezer. They broadcast from the loudspeaker at the village temple. Mohammed Akhlaq, the 50-year-old labourer named by the boys, was lynched.

Activists have spent more than a decade campaigning to protect the Nujiang, or \u201cangry river\u201d, from a cascade of dams, fearing they would displace tens of thousands of people and irreparably damage one of China\u2019s most spectacular and bio-diverse regions.  Since the start of this year, hopes had been building that Beijing would finally abandon plans to dam the 1,750-mile waterway, which snakes down from the Tibetan plateau through some of China\u2019s most breathtaking scenery before entering Myanmar, Thailand and eventually flowing into the Andaman Sea. On Friday, campaigners said that appears to have happened after China\u2019s State Energy Administration published a policy roadmap for the next five years that contained no mention of building any hydroelectric dams on the Nu.  \u201cI am absolutely thrilled,\u201d said Wang Yongchen, a Chinese conservationist and one of the most vocal opponents of the plans, which first surfaced in 2003.  Wang, who has made 17 trips to the Nu region as part of her crusade to protect the river, said geologists, ecologists, sociologists and members of the public who had been part of the campaign could all take credit for halting the dams.  \u201cI think this is a triumph for Chinese civil society,\u201d the Beijing-based activist said.      Aerial view of the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river, the biggest such project on earth. Photograph: Stringer Shanghai/Reuters/Corbis    Stephanie Jensen-Cormier, the China programme director for International Rivers, said environmentalists were \u201cvery happy and very excited\u201d at what was a rare piece of good news for China\u2019s notoriously stressed waterways.  \u201cThe state of rivers in China is so dismal. Thirty years ago there were 50,000 rivers in China; today there are less than 23,000. Rivers have completely disappeared. They have become polluted, they have become overused for agriculture and manufacturing,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it is so exciting when a major river \u2013 which is a major river for Asia \u2013 is protected, at least where it flows in China.\u201d Jensen-Cormier said the shelving of plans to dam the Nu \u2013 which is known as the Salween in Thailand and the Thanlwin in parts of Myanmar \u2013 represented \u201ca great turning point for the efforts to preserve China\u2019s rivers\u201d.  \u201cIt is a really good indication that China is starting to look at other ways of developing energy, and renewable energies especially, that mean they don\u2019t have to sacrifice their remaining healthy river.\u201d  China is the world\u2019s hydro champion, having built tens of thousands of dams since the 1950s \u2013 including the Three Gorges, the world\u2019s biggest project of its kind. Hydropower is a key plank of the country\u2019s bid to reduce its dependence on \u201cdirty\u201d fossil fuels such as coal and produce 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.  And while dambuilding is set to continue in other parts of China, such as Tibet, activists highlight three key reasons as to why Beijing may have decided to ditch plans to dam the Nu.  One is the growing concern for the environment shown by China\u2019s leaders, after decades in which economic growth was given precedence over environmental protection. \u201cWe will make China a beautiful country with blue sky, green vegetation and clear rivers,\u201d President Xi Jinping promised in September when world leaders gathered in China for the G20. A second explanation is concern over the wisdom of building such mega-projects in China\u2019s seismically active south-west, where geologists warn of potentially catastrophic accidents were an earthquake to strike near such dams.      Water is discharged from the Three Gorges dam to lower the level in its reservoir in Yichang after torrential rain in 2010. Photograph: Stringer Shanghai/REUTERS    Third, and perhaps most importantly, is the economics. Waning demand for power, a consequence of China\u2019s slowing economy, and the difficulty of transmitting electricity from remote regions such as Yunnan to the rest of the country, means many believe large-scale dams no longer make financial sense. \u201cThere is already an excess of energy that is produced in Yunnan and can\u2019t actually be used and also it\u2019s not really financially viable either to be developing the river at this time,\u201d said Jensen-Cormier. Having, for now, turned away from plans to dam the Nu, local politicians are poised to push ahead with plans to develop tourism in the impoverished border region.  Speaking in March, Li Jiheng, Yunnan\u2019s Communist party chief, spoke of plans to transform a region some call \u201cChina\u2019s Grand Canyon\u201d into a world-class tourism destination that would surpass its namesake in Arizona.  Jensen-Cormier predicted that the influx of investors and tourists to the bio-diverse area, which scientists say is home to half of China\u2019s animal species and 6,000 species of plant, would pose a new set of challenges for environmentalists.  Wang Yongchen, who runs Green Earth Volunteers, one of China\u2019s oldest environmental groups, cautioned that while the decision to scrap plans for dams on the Nu was a significant triumph, it was not necessarily a permanent one. \u201cThey haven\u2019t said they will never build the dams, so we still need to carry on fighting.

But when Capello and his men looked around the dressing room before kick-off they usually found Terry was the only England player not frozen into silence, bowed with angst or \u2013 in the colloquialism used \u2013 \u201cshitting it\u201d under the weight of the England shirt. Terry was unafraid. He made the others less afraid. You can see it, can\u2019t you? No matter where you stand on the John Terry moral universe, he would still be a pretty good person to, say, come with you on the train to Birmingham to help give a PowerPoint presentation to an aggressively sceptical sales conference audience. Or to go out on a sky dive with, just the two of you up in some howling fuselage above the Arapaho National Forest, the japes, the backslaps, the emergency chute slung away \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t need it, mate\u201d \u2013 JT hurling himself out first into that screaming void still talking about Lewis Hamilton or The X Factor. \u201cI\u2019m coming, John. I\u2019m coming with you. Catch me. Catch me,\u00a0John.\u201d   Related: Football transfer rumours: is John Terry off to Shanghai Shenhua?    This ability to inspire from the front has been surplus to requirements during the current Chelsea run of seven league wins and six clean sheets. Just as for the first time in the Abramovich era, Terry\u2019s absence through injury for a game as big as Saturday\u2019s lunchtime trip to Manchester City is suddenly not really an issue, no longer a source of fretful speculation. The news this week is that Conte plans to \u201cphase out\u201d his captain, with the suggestion Terry could even be off to Shanghai Shenhua in January. In a bizarro-world twist, Shanghai Shenhua are managed by Gus Poyet, the player Terry replaced to make his Chelsea league debut against Southampton 18 years ago, a sign, perhaps, of some late 1990s Chelsea Valhalla out there in the glare of the new world. Maybe Jody Morris and Michael Duberry are also in town and everyone\u2019s off to Boujis later with Dane Bowers. Either way, the signs are clear enough. Terry will turn 36 this week. He is by five years the longest serving current player at any Premier League club. He\u2019s still out there: still leading, still captaining, still legending. But after 18 wild, glorious years the sense of an ending is now impossible to ignore.     John Terry, the centre of attention after the Champions League final win against Bayern Munich in 2012, for which he was suspended but put on his kit to claim the trophy. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images    Before we get lost in more formal goodbyes closer to the time, there are perhaps three things worth saying about the Terry years. First: hate him, loathe him or support Chelsea, this has been one of the great, unignorable English sporting lives of the current century. Terry has been relentlessly visible throughout the creation of a modern\u2011day powerhouse. Should Chelsea win another league title this season, they will be unarguably English football\u2019s premier force since 2004, when Terry became captain and they first began to spend in earnest. In total Terry has now been present for 64% of Chelsea\u2019s total accumulated silverware since the club were formed in 1905 as a fill-in for the empty Fulham Road stadium. This is in part Conte\u2019s challenge: a first trophy outside the main span of the Terry Supremacy. There has already been a change of tone and texture. The current three-man defensive wedge is mobile and aggressive. Whereas Terry has become more minimal with age, sitting deep, playing flatter, taking the air out of the game. In Chelsea\u2019s last title campaign, he committed 13 fouls all season in the league, and made just over one tackle per 90 minutes. He could perhaps have been a more striking, more expressive player in his best years. He might have used his ease on the ball to push his team forward: in 2011 Terry was rated the third most accurate passer in Europe; he still has more career goals than Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. Instead he has pared back his game, playing within his limits and becoming an irresistibly familiar presence, the one constant through Chelsea\u2019s modern triumphs those great, beaming hollering Terry features, victory sealed with the standard shots of triumphant post-match JT striding about shirtless, invariably cropped at the waist to give the unnerving impression of a man so committed to the cause he\u2019s just played the full 90 minutes bullishly, unapologetically in the nude.     John Terry with QPR\u2019s Anton Ferdinand during the Premier League match at Loftus Road in October 2011, which led to Terry\u2019s ban for using racist language. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA    So much for the good times. The second thing about Terry is, of course, his toxic mistakes, his wider unpopularity. The scrapes, the splashes, the priapism: this is no more than lurid detail. But the FA ban for using racist language during a match will remain an indelible stain. The court case alone provided an extraordinary glimpse into the dismal internal monologue of the professional game. Terry has apologised and admitted that his language was completely unacceptable He is at least right there. Beyond this, as the waters start to close above his head, the most striking thing about Terry is simply his basic presence in extraordinary times. In a way Chelsea have been a case study, an outlier for the eviscerating changes in English football. Billionaire ownership, the large-scale bartering of success, the bolting on of a new, aggressively burnished brand to our creaky old Victorian community centres: there is in principle something deeply odd and uncharted about this.   Related: John Terry describes Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as \u2018very best I have ever worked with\u2019    Just as being a billionaire is in itself inane \u2013 a process of being continually replete, existing within a sealed world of chinchilla\u2011skin helicopter rides and seven-star homogeneity \u2013 so the billionaire\u2019s project club is also an inane idea and entirely anti-sport, a sanding down of edges and imperfections and thrilling variables into cold, hard, cash\u2011bought certainties. This is not sport. It\u2019s not football. It doesn\u2019t actually have to work at all. Football can survive most things. But not the moment supporters stop caring about their club and its players. It is a challenge that is yet to hit but that always lurks just beyond the fringes and the fury. At Chelsea the age of Abramovich has worked so far, both as a spectacle and as a coherent whole that still feels like the same coherent whole. At times, at least in those raw early days, this has felt like it was in large part because of Terry\u2019s vividness, his persuasive spirit, a player who has been not so much the brains or the heart of his club as its bowels, the hard colonic centre that ensures Chelsea have through it all still smelt like a football\u00a0team.", "tags": ["John Terry", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-02T13:59:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/03/trump-bay-street-new-jersey-relied-on-immigrant-visa-funds", "sentences": ["': Trump Village residents aren't enthusiastic about their namesake    \u201cHis strong stance is against illegal immigration,\u201d said the former New York governor George Pataki at a forum in Shanghai soon after Trump\u2019s election in November."], "title": "$50m Trump-branded development relied on immigrant visa funds", "article": "The first residential Trump-branded development to open since Donald Trump\u2019s election victory last month opened for business in Jersey City, New Jersey, this week. The gleaming Trump Bay Street complex, a luxury rental project completed under the direction of Jared Kushner, son-in-law and would-be White House adviser to the president-elect, sits across the Hudson river, minutes from Manhattan\u2019s financial district by train or ferry.   Related: Trump's conflicts of interest: a visual guide    The project was built by the Kushner family\u2019s Kushner Co operation, which boasts of completing more than $7bn in acquisitions under Jared Kushner, its CEO, since 2007.  The 50-storey building is not lacking in Trumpian grandiosity. Renters are promised a top-hat-wearing concierge and furnishings chosen by the personal decorator for Ivanka Trump, Kushner\u2019s wife, in conjunction with the home furnishing superbrand Restoration Hardware. But critics say Trump Bay Street, which uses the Trump name under licence and is now leasing apartments starting at $3,100 a month, is also a showcase for something else: the misuse of an controversial immigrant visa program originally designed to promote economic investment to disadvantaged areas through the sale of visas that can ultimately be converted to citizenship.  Kushner\u2019s development, with its chefs, dining tables and elaborate health and sports facilities, was completed with upward of $50m raised through EB-5 financing, according to a slide presentation by US Immigration Fund. The EB-5 program is popular with Chinese nationals with $500,000 or more to invest in US development projects. In 2014, the most recent year for which records are available, the US issued 10,692 of these visas \u2013 85% to people from China, according to the Department of Homeland Security.  But Trump Bay could soon become a focal point not only of efforts to reform EB-5 but also of the incoming Trump administration\u2019s unresolved family business conflicts.  \u201cEB-5 is an extremely complicated, corruption-prone way to bring foreign investment into the US,\u201d says David North, a Fellow of the Center for Immigration Studies, \u201cand in this case it is part and parcel of the conflict of interest issues that are flying around the incoming administration.\u201d  North estimates that more than 60% of all EB-5 investment in the US comes into Manhattan and surrounding areas while the majority of applications originate in China.  In recent months, the EB-5 program has been the subject of bipartisan criticism in Washington, with opponents including Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, vowing to end the system when it comes up for renewal in Congress this month.  On the Republican side, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has described the program as \u201criddled with corruption and national security vulnerabilities\u201d. In August, a report issued by the Government Accountability Office said it could not be sure that the money used for EB-5 was not coming from \u201cthe drug trade, human trafficking or other criminal activities\u201d. Critics of the system say not only is the $500,000 investment threshold too low but the funds the program raises frequently go toward luxury developments in New York or Miami and not, as originally stipulated, to disadvantaged areas as the scheme originally intended. A New York University study found that EB-5 investment was largely financing luxury developments, including a Chinese-style casino in Las Vegas, a Waldorf Astoria hotel in Beverly Hills and the redevelopment of the Hudson rail yards in Manhattan.   \u201cIt\u2019s hard for smaller states and cities to compete with the glitzy hotels and luxurious condo projects,\u201d Grassley argued at a congressional hearing.  But supporters, including the Democrats\u2019 incoming Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, claim EB-5 has pumped almost $9bn into the economy and created more than 35,000 jobs since it was created in 1990. The future of the EB-5 program could now be coloured by Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises to crack down on immigration.  In September, Congress passed a resolution keeping the program alive to 9 December. Legislators will now have to agree on a reform for the program or let it expire.  But some believe Trump will not simply back maintaining EB-5 but expanding it.   Related: 'What election?': Trump Village residents aren't enthusiastic about their namesake    \u201cHis strong stance is against illegal immigration,\u201d said the former New York governor George Pataki at a forum in Shanghai soon after Trump\u2019s election in November. \u201cAnd EB-5 is a legal immigration program. He understands the need for capital, the need for investment.\u201d With Congress being lobbied to extend EB-5 indefinitely, one of the options open to the president-elect could be to back raising the investment bar and introducing reforms that ensure investment capital flows to disadvantaged areas at the expense of New York or other wealthy areas.  But North, for one, was not holding his breath for that.  \u201cThe way the program works now is as an asset transfer program for rich Chinese investors to line the pockets of rich New York developers. The administration could make the program less useful to the rich of New York and more useful for the rest of us.

Because they might be getting married again. I see. This 1980s revival is getting completely out of hand. It sure is. What makes you think they might be getting back together, anyway?

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s programme for international student assessment (Pisa) found a little-changed performance in reading, maths and science among 15- and 16-year-olds in England \u2013 but good enough to make it the best performing UK nation after a sharp decline in Scotland\u2019s performance.   Maths   In the 2015 election campaign, the Conservatives said they aimed to have England among the top countries in Europe by 2020 based on international rankings. But the steep improvement now required means the ambition is doomed after the latest results were almost identical to the OECD\u2019s 2012 tests. The Pisa exams are administered to more than 500,000 pupils in the 70 countries that paid to take part, with the three subjects examined worldwide at the end of 2015. At the top of the table, Singapore replaced Shanghai for all three subjects tested, with Shanghai\u2019s stellar maths effort in 2012 diluted by the addition of students from Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong this time, sending its results tumbling.   Reading   The UK\u2019s combined ranking in science rose six places to 15th despite a slight fall in pupil performances, illustrating the fluctuations of the Pisa league tables and why education experts prefer to look at a country\u2019s exam scores rather than international placings to gauge success. The UK\u2019s maths ranking fell by one place to 27th but its reading position rose two places, although in both cases the actual scores were barely changed from 2012\u2019s exam results. \u201cFor the UK as a whole this is not a bad result: essentially no change,\u201d said Robert Coe, professor of education at Durham University. \u201cNow that the political contexts of the education systems of the four UK nations are entirely separate, people will increasingly concentrate on the performance of those separate nations.   Science   \u201cAll three measures place England, Scotland and Wales in that order, and these gaps will no doubt be the focus of intense political attention and rivalry.\u201d While Shanghai\u2019s demise meant that the gap between the UK and the top of the table closed dramatically, the static results make it almost impossible for the British government to realise its aim in the 2015 Conservative manifesto \u201cto make Britain the best place in the world to study maths, science and engineering, measured by improved performance in the Pisa league tables\u201d. Nicky Morgan, the then education secretary, also said during the election campaign that England\u2019s schools were to be \u201cthe best in Europe for literacy and maths by 2020\u201d.   In the UK average performance in all three subjects has fallen in the past three years   The 2015 results place the UK among a group of similar European countries including France and Spain, and behind leading lights such as Finland, Estonia, Ireland and Germany. But ministers in London may be buoyed by England\u2019s better performance compared with the three other home nations. Scotland in particular suffered a poor set of results, with substantial falls in reading and science compounded by a fall in maths. England scored 500 in reading and 493 in maths, while Scotland dipped to 493 in reading and 491 in maths, a fall of 13 and seven points respectively from 2012.   Performance in science fell across the UK in 2015   Scotland\u2019s weak results left England as the highest scoring UK nation in both science and reading, and tied with Northern Ireland for the best result in maths. Labour\u2019s Scottish education spokesman, Iain Gray, said the SNP should be ashamed by the results. \u201cThese are terrible results after 10 years of SNP government. They must wake up to the fact that their cuts to school budgets, teachers numbers and support staff are damaging the life chances of Scotland\u2019s children,\u201d Gray said.  John Swinney, the Scottish education secretary, admitted the Pisa figures \u201cundoubtedly make uncomfortable reading\u201d but said its findings underlined the \u201cplain message\u201d that sweeping reforms of school education were needed. Those would include detailed attainment measures for each school \u2013 attacked by critics as new league tables, and devolving control to schools and communities. \u201cIt is by carrying through on these reforms \u2013 no matter how controversial \u2013 that we can make Scottish education world-class again,\u201d Swinney said. Wales also lost ground in science and reading. There was better news for reformers in Cardiff with a substantial improvement in maths scores. However, Wales alone of the UK nations fell below the OECD average in all three subjects.   In Scotland performance in reading had its largest fall, from a high in 2012   Kirsty Williams, Wales\u2019 education secretary, said the advice she had received from a recent OECD report was to press on with the government\u2019s school reforms. \u201cPisa may divide opinion but it is the recognised international benchmark for skills. It has never been more important to demonstrate to ourselves, and to the world, that our young people can compete with the best,\u201d Williams said.   Wales still underperforms in maths compared to the rest of the UK despite improvements in 2015   \u201cOther small, innovative nations have stolen a march on us in their reform journeys. But if Ireland and Estonia can do it, so can we.\u201d Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, said more grammar schools could boost future Pisa results for England: \u201cWe know that grammar schools provide a good education for their disadvantaged pupils, which is why we want more pupils from lower income backgrounds to benefit from them.\u201d   In Australia average rankings in all three subjects have fallen over the past six years but are still higher than in the UK   But Gibbs\u2019 view was disputed by Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, who said Pisa offered \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that early selection of pupils by schools did not narrow gaps in attainment. \u201cAny government serious about evidence-based policy must address this finding,\u201d Hobby said. John Jerrim, of the UCL Institute of Education, said the science results showed England\u2019s grammar school pupils to be among the best performers in the world. \u201cThese figures do not provide any evidence as to whether grammar schools are more effective than other school types, as differences in the demographic characteristics of pupils and their prior achievement has not been taken into account,\u201d Jerrim said. Andreas Schleicher, director of education for the OECD, said the Pisa data showed \u201cclearly and consistently\u201d that selection by ability at a young age led to middle class students doing better at the expense of the more disadvantaged. \u201cAs you make a system more selective, you have to redouble your efforts to mediate its impact on social backgrounds. That is really important,\u201d Schleicher said. Schleicher also said that the spate of school reforms in UK nations were yet be felt.  \u201cWhen I look at Wales, I think the really interesting reforms are too recent to show any impact. I actually think they have a lot of promise but you can\u2019t see them now,\u201d he said. \u201cScotland is more of a surprise to me, I would have hoped and expected that some of the efforts they have made would have come out. But in the data there is no evidence, rather the opposite.\u201d In England, with the advent of academies and greater school autonomy, \u201cyou\u2019d have hoped that, certainly at the top end, England would be more prominent than it is. Maybe it\u2019s too soon,\u201d Schleicher said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t see improvements it\u2019s important to revisit maybe not the design but the implementation. It\u2019s important to keep a careful eye on that,\u201d Schleicher said. Singapore\u2019s success, topping all three tables in mathematics, reading and science, has been seized on by enthusiasts of the \u201cmastery\u201d approach to maths, deployed to great success in Singapore and east Asian countries at the top of the OECD tables and in other recent international maths tests.   In the US the average ranking for maths fell to 470 in 2015   The mastery approach aims to deepen pupils\u2019 conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts, covering fewer topics but in greater depth. The UK government has developed a teacher exchange programme with Shanghai and wants to roll out the mastery method in England\u2019s classrooms. So far, more than 360 schools have implemented the mastery method, reaching 3,000 teachers and almost 100,000 primary and secondary pupils. Helen Drury, executive director of the mathematics mastery development programme, said the UK remained in \u201ca frustratingly average position\u201d in the Pisa tables but the results were a reminder of what can be learned from high performing countries. British teachers should be given time for high-quality professional development throughout their career, as is standard in Singapore and Shanghai, Drury said. Details from the report showed a high percentage of head teachers in the UK complained about staff shortages, while truancy was higher than many other OECD countries. Why do you think schools in some areas perform better than others? In the UK, England\u2019s results are now better than Scotland and Wales, and in Europe, Finland, Estonia, Ireland and Germany lead the top of the table with their results.

Sample Pisa exam questions \u2013 science Q: Most migratory birds gather in one area and then migrate in large groups rather than individually. This behaviour is a result of evolution. Which of the following is the best scientific explanation for the evolution of this behaviour in most migratory birds? A: Birds that migrated individually or in small groups were less likely to survive and have offspring. B: Birds that migrated individually or in small groups were more likely to find adequate food. C: Flying in large groups allowed other bird species to join the migration. D: Flying in large groups allowed each bird to have a better chance of finding a nesting site. [answer: A]   Q: Rocks in space that enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere are called meteoroids. Meteoroids heat up, and glow as they fall through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Most meteoroids burn up before they hit Earth\u2019s surface. When a meteoroid hits Earth it can make a hole called a crater. As a meteoroid approaches Earth and its atmosphere, it speeds up. Why does this happen? A: The meteoroid is pulled in by the rotation of Earth. B: The meteoroid is pushed by the light of the Sun. C: The meteoroid is attracted to the mass of Earth. D: The meteoroid is repelled by the vacuum of space.

Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, announced that Liverpool\u2019s World Museum would be the next destination for the spectacular treasures which China\u2019s first emperor, Qin Shihuangdi, had made to accompany him into the afterlife. Bradley is in China on a cultural bridge-building mission. She said: \u201cThe terracotta army represents one of the most significant archaeological excavations of the 20th century, and I am delighted that a selection of the warriors will be coming to Liverpool for the first time in 2018. I am sure that the exhibition will be very warmly received by the people of Merseyside and beyond as Britain welcomes back the terracotta warriors. \u201cThe exhibition will also encourage an ongoing cultural exchange between China and Britain, further progressing the relationship between our two nations and strengthening lasting ties.\u201d The warriors were last in the UK in 2007 for what was the British Museum\u2019s second most successful exhibition ever after the Tutankhamun fever of 1972. That show was seen by 1.7 million people, while the terracotta army was seen by 850,000. Before that the warriors were last in the UK in 1985, at a much smaller exhibition at the City Art Centre in Edinburgh. Liverpool expects the blockbuster show to be on a similar scale to London, with visitors from across the UK and Europe. About 120 objects or sets of objects will be on display, some of which have never been seen in the UK.  Unlike the London show, it will cover the the pre-unification Qin kings (307 to 221BC) and the first emperor\u2019s legacy in the Han Dynasty (206BC to AD220). David Fleming, director of National Museums Liverpool, said the organisation was \u201chugely excited\u201d to have signed a memorandum of understanding to bring the warriors to the city. The show will run for six months from February to October 2018. \u201cFollowing the success of our Mayas exhibition in 2015, and the reopening of our Ancient Egypt gallery in 2017, this is a significant time for World Museum and National Museums Liverpool. It is really important that we stay in healthy dialogue with our international colleagues.\u201d Fleming said it would be a particularly proud moment for the city as Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe. \u201cWe are proud to be strengthening the city\u2019s connections with other cultural organisations in China and creating an exhibition programme that continues to excite and inspire visitors from across the globe,\u201d he added. It was 1974 when a man digging a well struck upon one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries the world has seen. Since then, more than 8,000 lifesized terracotta warriors \u2013 with individual clothing, hair and facial features \u2013 have been discovered near the city of Xi\u2019an.  They tell a remarkable story about an emperor who put an end to 350 years of warring states in the late third century BC and wanted to extend his rule into eternity. The vast army of clay warriors was there to protect him forever. This week, Bradley is leading a delegation of the UK\u2019s cultural industries to China, the latest attempt to build bridges after the damaging row earlier this summer over Hinkley Point C. Last month Theresa May talked about a \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations between the two countries as she met Ma Kai, one of China\u2019s vice-premiers. The UK has been using culture as a soft power tool in China for a number of years. This year, for example, the Royal Shakespeare Company embarked on its first major tour of China and the British Library has organised exhibitions with literary treasures such as Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio and Charlotte Bronte\u2019s fair copy manuscript to Jane Eyre.

On Friday Scott Morrison announced he had approved the bid from Australian Outback Beef, which is 67% owned by Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Beef and 33% owned by Shanghai CRED. The largest station in the Kidman group, Anna Creek in South Australia, and its outstation The Peake, will be bought by the Williams family, a local farming family with adjoining properties. The rest will be sold to the joint venture. Morrison said the deal increased Australian ownership in the properties currently part of the Kidman group from 66.1% to 74.7%.   Related: Families bidding for S Kidman and Co confirm they would divide up most of land    Rinehart said the purchase would put her company in the top three beef producers in Australia, with a combined herd size growing to about 300,000 head.The company planned to invest in technology and infrastructure with the potential to create 100 jobs in regional communities. \u201cThe treasurer\u2019s approach to the sale of Kidman enabled a local Australian company to pay a fair market price and retain Kidman in Australian control,\u201d she said. The Australian-owned Hancock will control the board and day-to-day operation of the business, which will remain incorporated and headquartered in South Australia. Existing environmental and other commitments will be honoured. \u201cConsistent with the recommendation from the foreign investment review board (Firb), I have decided that the acquisition of Kidman as proposed would not be contrary to the national interest and will be permitted to proceed as proposed,\u201d Morrison said. The treasurer said the sale process had been \u201cextensive and heavily scrutinised\u201d, referring to two decisions blocking the sale to foreign investors on national security grounds first in November 2015 then to a Chinese-owned consortium in April. Security concerns that influenced the earlier rejections had been mitigated by excising Anna Creek, the largest single property holding in Australia, from the sale. Part of Anna Creek is in the Woomera protected area in South Australia. In October the joint venture knocked out a syndicate of Australian graziers by increasing its bid to $386.5m. Greg Campbell, Kidman\u2019s managing director, said staff and management were excited about entering into a \u201cnew and transformational phase\u201d of the business. \u201cI know I speak not only for myself but for many Kidman employees when I say we are pleased that Hancock, a highly respected Australian company, leads the joint venture that has received key approvals to acquire Kidman,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMrs Gina Rinehart is a prominent Australian and we appreciate her desires to further invest and grow the business.\u201d The company also welcomed the commitment to keep the Kidman head office in Adelaide. Kidman is one of Australia\u2019s largest beef producers, with pastoral leases covering 101,000 sq km across South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland. There are 19 individual properties operated as 12 enterprises \u2013 10 cattle stations, a bull breeding stud farm and a feedlot. The divestment of Anna Creek and The Peake stations will reduce the land area bought by Outback Beef to 77,700 sq km. The approval of the sale is likely to win support from One Nation which had welcomed the Hancock-Shanghai joint venture. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, told the ABC in October: \u201cI would rather Australia have two-thirds in Kidman station, rather than the total ownership and control by the Chinese or any other foreign investor. \u201cCongratulations to Gina Rinehart for actually taking up and buying Kidman.\u201d But independent lower house MP Bob Katter expressed outrage on Friday, accusing the treasurer of selling out the country by approving the deal. \u201cDoes anyone seriously think that Shanghai CRED, with its parent company having put in a bid for the whole lot, [are] going to settle for a third?\u201d Morrison said any future changes in ownership, including any increase in interest by Shanghai CRED, will require subsequent Firb and treasurer approval.

The arts must be in the equation | Kester Brewin", "article": "As a long-time maths teacher, the latest assessments by the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and Programme for International Student Assessment make for tough reading. They indicate that there is little evidence of real gains having been made in maths and science in England over the past four years.   Related: UK schools fail to climb international league table    Now that the government\u2019s policy to emphasise Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) appears to have borne meagre fruit, I\u2019m wondering whether it has been worth the effort. Almost silent on the issue so far, ministers in England might want to claim that these reports show the nation pretty much holding its own; but the real picture is more worrying. The Timss assessment saw England\u2019s ranking in science for 13 and 14-year-olds move up from 9th to 8th, but this was mostly put down to Finland not entering for that age group. There were slight improvements in performance in maths, but not on the level of gains seen by Kazakhstan, pushing England down from 10th to 11th place. Released this week, the Pisa study saw pupils in England get lower scores than previously, but, because of variations in the participating nations, it was accompanied with a shift up in ranking. What, then, do we have to show for the past few years\u2019 vigorous emphasis on Stem? Not a great deal \u2013 and I believe that rather than pushing schools towards narrowing curricula to give more time to maths and science, ministers should be encouraging them to restore the arts to their proper place. In my own south-east London school there has been pressure to add more maths lessons. As a department we have resisted because we felt it right that the school continued to offer a broad and balanced curriculum, with music, art and drama given proper space in the timetable. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t always the case elsewhere. My son \u2013 in Year 8 at a large boys comprehensive \u2013 has a compacted Key Stage 3, squeezing everything into Years 7 and 8 and beginning GCSE courses in Year 9. With more time given to science and maths, instead of three years of art and different aspects of design technology, he gets two terms of each, spread over two years.    Continuing to ask more from teachers, while giving them less to do it, is a recipe for disaster    The focus on Stem was meant to deliver a narrowing of the achievement gap between UK pupils and those in the Pisa league-topping Asian countries like Singapore and South Korea. \u201cSingaporean maths\u201d have been the buzzwords over the past few years, but is matching their students\u2019 achievements in maths and science a worthy aspiration for us in the UK? A typical day for a pupil in Singapore involves hours of intense private tuition late into the evening. This is an educational culture massively focused on Stem achievement, and one that creates very high stress and anxiety. In chasing this elite group at the top of the Pisa rankings, are we prepared to have our teenage suicide rate doubled to match theirs too? Of course, there are things we can learn from the way that maths and science are taught in high-performing nations. Yet the league table that few in the Department for Education are prepared to talk about is the one that shows the average UK teacher spending 4 days per year receiving professional development, while teachers in Shanghai receive 40 days annually. In terms of the time we are investing in helping teachers become more skilled professionals, we rank 30th out of 36 developed nations. Continuing to ask more from teachers, while giving them less to do it, is a recipe for disaster \u2013 not just for league table positions, but for the wellbeing and mental health of staff, and thus the progress of pupils too. If we really want our students to do better, we should invest properly in our teachers. Decisions on educational priorities are about the sort of nation we want to become. The UK already ranks second in the list of most Nobel laureates \u2013 with the majority of these prizes coming in science and medicine. In forcing an ever more efficient production line of high-performing school-level mathematicians and scientists, we risk strangling the creative arts. My hunch is that British strength in the arts is integral to understanding why we have so many Nobel prizes: breakthroughs in science and technology always need a spark of creativity, too. Science and engineering aside, from a purely economic standpoint the UK\u2019s creative industries have been growing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the economy, as the government\u2019s own figures show. In a world rankings for playwrights, bands, designers and artists, I\u2019d bet that we leave those currently at the top of Pisa far behind. We do need to reaffirm the significance of science and maths to our technological prowess; but we must never forget the huge importance of teaching the arts to our future economy and cultural heritage.", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "Mathematics", "Science", "Science", "UK news"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-09T07:30:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/10/crazy-for-sure-stars-musically-max-harvey-mills", "sentences": ["Launched in Shanghai in 2014, it began to take off last year and has quietly hit the phones of more than 140m users.", "Musical.ly, which has about 120 staff in Shanghai and Los Angeles, estimates that half of all American teenagers now have the app."], "title": "'It's crazy, for sure': meet the stars of Musical.ly", "article": "Paul Mills is using his phone to live-stream footage of his twin sons while they record their first music video.

Photograph: Mark Chilvers for the Guardian    Max and Harvey are Britain\u2019s biggest Musers, the name given to the users of Musical.ly, an insanely popular social music app. Launched in Shanghai in 2014, it began to take off last year and has quietly hit the phones of more than 140m users. That\u2019s almost half the number of people who use Twitter, which took three years to build up a comparable following. At its simplest, Musical.ly is a music video maker combining features of Snapchat, Instagram and Vine. Its founder, Alex Zhu, came up with the idea after spotting teens on a train filming themselves listening to music on headphones. In the app, Musers choose from a library of more than a million songs, select a 15-second snippet, then lip-synch to it exuberantly while filming themselves, typically in selfie mode. Increasingly, people perform comedy skits, dances or lip-synchs to film dialogue. Some, such as Max and Harvey, sing for real as well as lip-synch. They can add filters and Snapchat-style face adornments (selecting \u201cswag\u201d adds a gold chain and a black cap). Musical.lys, as the looping clips are known, are then shared with followers. Live.ly, launched in June, a live-streaming sister app, gives Musers the freedom to broadcast anything, for 20 minutes at a time on average. The twins lead a tribe of 2.5m Musers in the UK, most of them aged 13 to 24. At the time of writing, their joint account has 2.48m followers (they gain about 10,000 new fans a day). They never drop off the top of the UK leaderboard, and routinely feature in the global top 10. In the US, home to half of all Musers, the biggest stars have more than 10m fans. Musical.ly, which has about 120 staff in Shanghai and Los Angeles, estimates that half of all American teenagers now have the app. Teen by teen, it is holding up a mirror to a new generation of digital natives, and changing the music industry.         Max and Harvey\u2019s mashup of Treat You Better and Stitches.     Musical.ly features videos it likes on the app\u2019s homepage; the sudden exposure means Musers can get very big, very quickly. The app\u2019s biggest stars now have agents, merchandise and, in some cases, record deals. It\u2019s why Max and Harvey, who signed up in March, are making a real-life music video, with their own voices \u2013 they want to take their success to the next level. Today\u2019s shoot, and a session in a recording studio yesterday, have been arranged by Cassie Petrey, who runs Crowdsurf, a digital marketing firm in Los Angeles, and Tim Byrne, the British former creative director at Syco Entertainment, Simon Cowell\u2019s label (Byrne now runs Fandom Management, also based in LA). When Petrey was 12 and at school in Kentucky, she made an online Backstreet Boys fanzine. Years later, while working for record labels in Nashville, she alerted executives to a new website called Myspace, and ran pages for artists. Now 30, but \u201cstill a fangirl at heart\u201d, she looks for talent on Musical.ly. She says the app is changing the game. \u201cMax and Harvey did a Live.ly a couple of days ago, and there were, like, 50,000 people watching it at once,\u201d she says by phone (the boys were fooling around at Alton Towers). \u201cI\u2019ve never seen live-streaming figures like that on any platform.\u201d Musical.ly also has a uniquely young audience, which partly explains the sense, outside the app, of a quiet rise to prominence. \u201cI see kids commenting all the time that they can\u2019t follow talent on other platforms, because their parents only let them use Musical.ly,\u201d Petrey says. Max and Harvey had about 150,000 followers when Petrey spotted them. She says she knew immediately that they could be stars. Her job now is to work on their digital output beyond Musical.ly (they need no help there). They now have almost 10 social media profiles, including a YouTube channel (3.9m views and counting). Engagement is the buzzword in this world, and Musical.ly succeeds by appearing to blur the line between idols and idolisers. Popular Musers are part of the community that sustains them, and a couple of featured clips can be all it takes for anyone to make it big. Really big.     Baby Ariel: \u2018Before social media, I didn\u2019t know who I was or what I wanted to do. Now I do.\u2019 Photograph: Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images    First came YouTube, where Justin Bieber put up his first video almost a decade ago, then Vine. \u201cNow people are saying, \u2018I want to be a Muser\u2019, and we have the resources to make that happen,\u201d says Tiffany Au, 28, director of communications at Collab, a \u201cdigital talent network and entertainment studio\u201d in LA. The firm helps about 400 digital creators, including Ariel Martin, better known as Baby Ariel. She is from South Florida, has just turned 16 and is by some distance Musical.ly\u2019s biggest star with \u2013 let\u2019s just check the latest figure \u2013 15m fans. She got the app a little over a year ago, after a friend showed it to her. In those early days, Musers were uploading static lip-synchs. \u201cI was like, how do I make this interesting,\u201d Baby Ariel says, \u201cso I decided to use hand motions and thought, oh, this is actually pretty cool.\u201d She has turned phone holding into an art form, and has been imitated by millions of Musers. In one recent clip, she lip-synchs to the Chainsmokers\u2019 hit Closer (it ambitiously rhymes \u201cback seat of your Rover\u201d with \u201ctattoo on your shoulder\u201d). Turning her phone into a choreographic aid, she makes it move around her face in time with the music, like a hummingbird sizing up a flower. While she chews gum through an exaggerated smile, mouthing the words \u201cso baby pull me closer\u201d, she uses her free hand to draw the camera in. She says her clips can take between 20 and 90 minutes to create. Before long, Baby Ariel was getting recognised. \u201cThis girl came up to me in Old Navy and I was like, \u2018No way, this is crazy. This is not a real thing\u2019.\u201d She later left school to study online, so that she could devote more time to Musical.ly, alongside her mother Sharon. She is now a \u201csocial media influencer\u201d with aspirations to act. She speaks to me from LA between auditions at Disney and Nickelodeon. She is also in town to join Jacob Sartorius on his US tour. Sartorius, 14, has more than 12m fans, and now records original music. Sweatshirt, his first single (\u201cGirl, you can wear my sweatshirt, \u2019cause you\u2019re the only one I hold, And I don\u2019t want you to be cold\u201d) made the iTunes top 10 and has more than 35m YouTube views. At the Troubadour club in Santa Monica, where, in 1970, Neil Diamond introduced Elton John to America, Baby Ariel DJ\u2019d while Jacob Sartorius of Oklahoma performed Sweatshirt to a sellout crowd. Fans are desperate to meet star Musers \u2013 and each other. When 17-year-old Violet Summersby noticed this in comments, she arranged a meet-up in New York. A dozen or so big names mingled with about 300 fans. Fifteen free events followed in cities across the US. Now the co-founder and CEO of Muser Movement, Summersby hosted the first ticketed meet-up in LA in November. As well as encouraging engagement, she believes the app reflects a healthier relationship between young people and social media. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you look like,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re funny or you\u2019ve got something to say, you can put it out there. Social media is changing now. There was this idea that you had to look like Kim Kardashian to be famous. That\u2019s not the case any more. You can be whoever you want to be, and that\u2019s now acceptable. It\u2019s not acceptable to be something that you\u2019re not. People want to see your true self.\u201d     The twins film their new video. Photograph: Mark Chilvers for the Guardian    It\u2019s a stirring vision, but it doesn\u2019t immediately square with the high proportion of telegenic, zit-free teens among Musical.ly\u2019s upper ranks, or with concerns about safety and privacy on the app. It is also clear that a significant proportion of Musers are younger than 13, the minimum age for app store downloads. There have been sporadic reports of attempted grooming via the app, and concerns about inappropriate lyrics and content; at least two UK police forces have reportedly investigated complaints by parents. But Musical.ly encourages parents to monitor use of the app, and says it removes inappropriate content within 15 minutes; it adds that concerned Musers or their parents should consider sacrificing potential fame and make their accounts private. All those I speak to, however, report seeing less nasty stuff, if any at all, on Musical.ly than elsewhere. Moreover, even if the top Musers resemble the glossy Mickey Mouse Club stars of yore, they believe that, for now at least, Musical.ly offers a freedom of expression and control that would have been alien to Britney Spears. \u201cMusical.ly has allowed me to find who I am as a person,\u201d Baby Ariel says. \u201cBefore social media, I didn\u2019t know who I was or what I wanted to do. Now I do.\u201d    Six months ago, no one would have ever approached us unless they were asking for directions    Where Musers find freedom and community, the music industry sees dollar signs. All the major labels make their tracks available on the app, which mobilises a bedroom battalion of promoters. In August, the label Republic reported a 23% increase in sales of Hailee Steinfeld\u2019s Starving after a promotion on Musical.ly. In the UK, Olly Murs of X Factor fame launched a #Challenge, another popular feature of the app, to promote a single on his new album 24 HRS. He lip-synched to Grow Up while wearing face filters, including a teddy bear\u2019s nose. \u201cCreate your own \u2018Grow Up\u2019 lip-synch video &amp; you could win a signed copy of 24 HRS,\u201d he wrote under his Musical.ly. Thousands of Musers have done so, adding the #GrowUpChallenge hashtag to their own clips and multiplying Murs\u2019 audience. At the time of writing, Max and Harvey have made the most-liked clip. The established stars courting Musers are at risk of being outshone. Baby Ariel now has almost 2m subscribers to her YouTube channel, roughly the same as Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes, perhaps the biggest conventional singers going for the same demographic. \u201cWe had an event at Disney, and all these Disney stars were there on the red carpet, but all the fans were around Baby Ariel,\u201d says Alex Hofmann, Musical.ly\u2019s German-born head of operations in North America. In October, Ariel made the cover of Billboard magazine. Thanks to Live.ly, the live-broadcast app, Musers are also cashing in. Those who stream footage through the app can receive special gift emojis that fans buy for cash as in-app purchases. iTunes and Musical.ly get a cut; the rest goes to the recipient, who may reward the gift with a BFF (best fan forever) award. According to the company, the top 10 Live.ly users have each made $46,000 on average over a two-week period. \u201cPeople are quitting jobs to do it full-time,\u201d Hofmann says.     Max and Harvey with superfan Milly Fincher. Photograph: Mark Chilvers for the Guardian    Back on the banks of the Thames, Max and Harvey have moved location to the London Eye. Another superfan turns up. Milly Fincher, 13, is shaking with excitement. She had been watching the skate park Live.ly at home and begged her dad, David, to bring her into London from Surbiton. During a break in filming, she meets her heroes and is speechless. They greet her like pros. \u201cSo your name\u2019s Milly, yeah?\u201d Max says. She nods. \u201cAwesome. How old are you?\u201d She tells them. \u201cAwesome. Would you like a picture?\u201d They pose together. Milly posts the picture to her Instagram later: \u201cSo this happened, and I\u2019m gonna be in a newspaper with them!\u201d she writes, adding five screaming emojis. \u201cIt\u2019s still crazy, for sure,\u201d Max says while considering fame on the way to Wagamama for a lunch break (they wanted Nando\u2019s, but it\u2019s a bit of a walk). \u201cSix months ago, no one would have ever approached us unless they were asking for directions,\u201d he adds, while Harvey plays Pok\u00e9mon Go, occasionally glancing up to check for obstacles. \u201cNow, people are asking people for directions for where to find us.\u201d         A compilation of this year\u2019s Max and Harvey\u2019s musical.ly videos    Fame has started to change family life, even if the money hasn\u2019t \u2013 yet.

But the boys are way ahead. I ask where they\u2019d like to be in five years, at 18. \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably when we\u2019d like to be touring globally,\u201d Max says.

It says much about the Italian\u2019s reinvention of this team over recent months that the subject of Chelsea\u2019s captain of 15 years had rather faded from the news agenda. There had been talk of the England setup using the defender as a mentor for younger players, or of coaching opportunities ahead, and almost an assumption his playing days are all but over. Conte was not quite having that. The centre-half is still recovering from a muscle problem in his buttock, ruling him out of the visit of West Bromwich Albion to Stamford Bridge, and has played six minutes since mid-September, but he has a role to play if this team are to extend their winning run. \u201cHe\u2019s still a footballer who is just injured at the moment, but he\u2019s continuing to be a leader in the changing room,\u201d Conte said. \u201cJohn asked me if he could come with us to Manchester City and stay with us before and during the game. That was important for me: John is our captain and you are a captain if you play or not, or if you are injured or not. He\u2019s showing great commitment at the moment, and I\u2019m pleased with this.\u201d   Related: Love John Terry or loathe him, an unignorable career is winding down | Barney Ronay    That is a very different role to organising and inspiring, barking orders and summoning tackles on the pitch, but it is one the 35-year-old has embraced. He is still there cajoling and encouraging, attempting to coax progress from Kurt Zouma after his own long-term injury problems or offering Nathaniel Chalobah advice on making his mark. The veteran is studying for his Uefa coaching badges and has been spied, stopwatch in hand, overseeing the unused substitutes\u2019 post-match warm-down sessions during his absence from the first team. The interest from abroad that will surface formally in January as his contract enters its final six months \u2013 led most likely by his former team-mate Gus Poyet pushing Shanghai Shenhua to offer the player terms \u2013 will not distract him. Terry feels he still has a role still to play in this club\u2019s title challenge and that will be his focus. His absence from the team has created a void into which Conte hopes others will now step. Chelsea are not blessed with the same imposing characters of the recent past, when Petr Cech and Frank Lampard, or Didier Drogba and Terry, would maintain standards and drive the team on. The manager has conceded it is time for some to grow. \u201cIt\u2019s important to increase the leadership qualities in the other players,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to see this and I ask it of my players, but we are improving on this aspect.\u201d And they are coming from unlikely sources. Gary Cahill is a player reborn in Conte\u2019s back three, and a centre-half who is benefiting from David Luiz\u2019s charisma and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s consistent excellence at his side. Eden Hazard has publicly admitted he has to raise his team-mates with pure skill on the ball rather than any tub-thumping in the dressing-room. \u201cI will never be like John Terry in that respect,\u201d he said recently. \u201cBut I can still be a leader in my own way.\u201d The same might apply to Diego Costa. The striker joined his manager and team-mate Pedro Rodr\u00edguez in claiming a personal award for his performances for November \u2013 Chelsea have the manager and player of the month for the second time in succession, while Pedro scored the most eye-catching goal to complete the clean sweep \u2013 and has arguably become the biggest inspiration of all. Costa used to be trouble. His was such a surly presence for most of last season and disquiet has now surfaced from within his camp over successive summers suggesting he still pines for life back at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Yet, from the petulant figure waving his arms in frustration at Conte during the victory over Leicester City in mid-October early on in the team\u2019s revival, he has suddenly become an example for all to follow. He still bullies his markers brutally, as Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi discovered so uncomfortably at the Etihad Stadium, but his weight of goals \u2013 43 in 68 Premier League games, even with one largely duff season incorporated \u2013 sets him apart. Just as significantly, he no longer appears a player at war with the world. He has gone nine games without a caution, a fourth of the term for some industrial language directed at the referee, Michael Oliver, at Arsenal when Chelsea last lost in the league. The striker has never gone so long without a card in his 11-year professional career. Conte could not really pinpoint what he has done to curb Costa\u2019s inner fury while maintaining an acceptable level of aggression in his approach. \u201cDiego is a real warrior and good for the team, because every game is a battle \u2013 a sporting battle \u2013 and it\u2019s important to have warriors in your side. He\u2019s improving a lot and putting his passion in the team in the best way.\u201d Even the manager had to fight to suppress his incredulity at recalling Costa the peacemaker during the melee, sparked by Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s lunge on David Luiz, at the end of the victory at Manchester City. \u201cDiego is showing his best side now. Before, all we heard was he was showing \u2018bad passion\u2019. Now he\u2019s showing his real character.\u201d All the frustration that would leave him a raging bull surrounded by opposition defenders has been channelled, his focus now on movement, strength and maintaining a goal tally swollen already to 11 in 14 league games. \u201cIn every game I ask the same things of my players: to be focused on the game, be focused to play football, only this,\u201d Conte said. \u201cThe other situations don\u2019t matter. Is Costa the best striker in England now? Yes, but I\u2019d always talk up my players. If you ask me the best goalkeeper or the best defender, I say my players. My players. I trust in them.\u201d There were times last season when Chelsea could not place such trust in a loose cannon of a forward, but now they take reassurance from his presence. The Brazil-born Spain international is not the same kind of driving force as Terry, and the club\u2019s natural born leader will always be missed, but this team are filling the void.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "John Terry", "Antonio Conte", "Diego Costa", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-10T22:30:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/11/best-thing-i-ate-2016-nigella-lawson-nadiya-hussain-rene-redzepi", "sentences": ["But the best single food item has to be the whole peking duck at Alan Yau\u2019s homage to the famed dinner-dance clubs of Shanghai, Park Chinois, just off London\u2019s Berkeley Square."], "title": "The best thing I ate in 2016", "article": "Fat chips with feta at Gazi, Melbourne:chosen by Nigella Lawson, food writer and broadcaster If I tell you that the best thing I ate this year was in January, please don\u2019t think that the rest of my eating year has been a disappointment: know that I would never allow that to be the case. I have a big thing about chips. Whenever I go out, I ask if the chips I see on the menu are hand-cut. I\u2019m nearly always told they are; they invariably aren\u2019t. That\u2019s no good \u2013 I\u2019m not interested if they\u2019re triple-fried in goose fat if they\u2019re not hand-cut. It\u2019s all about the rough edges, you see. Now, I have to say I didn\u2019t oversee how they cut the chips at a restaurant called Gazi in Melbourne when I was there in January, but they taste like the real thing \u2013 but different. They\u2019re fat chips that are halfway to potato wedges, fried in intensely garlicky oil and, once crisp and golden, tossed in a bowl with proper Greek dried oregano and crumbles of sharp feta. It\u2019s impossible not to eat well in Melbourne (well, in Australia generally), but these chips were absolutely worth flying the 10,496.05 miles for. Scallops with truffle puree at the Clove Club, LondonGregory Marchand, chef-patron, Frenchie, London This was really fresh, really beautiful and really, really tasty. The scallops came with a dashi jelly, mandarin juice, chopped hazelnuts and a brown-butter dressing, with some raw chestnut mushrooms shaved on top. Everything in the meal was stunning \u2013 the duck with fermented red cabbage puree was another standout \u2013 but this was the dish with the biggest wow factor. I still remember the experience of eating it. Cured past\u0131rma fish at Ismet Baba, IstanbulMarianna Leivaditaki, head chef, Morito Hackney Road, London Earlier this year, a few of us from Morito went to Istanbul. We had some amazing food but the most interesting thing was a dish we ate at a fish restaurant in Uskudar, right next to the Bosphorus, called Ismet Baba. The dish is bal\u0131k past\u0131rmas\u0131: swordfish cured with past\u0131rma spices, so lots of fenugreek, chilli flakes, cumin and caraway. Even though I cure fish myself, I had never eaten it in this way before. Then, a few months later, I went to Crete and had a very similar dish. I couldn\u2019t believe the coincidence. So I got to work and tried to replicate it \u2013 and I did it quite successfully. Now it\u2019s on our seafood menu. I\u2019ve turned it into a salad with capers, cherry tomatoes and some boiled baby potatoes, but in Turkey and Crete they just served it on its own with a little olive oil. Squid bolognese at Koffmann\u2019s, LondonTom Kitchin, chef-patron, The Kitchin, Edinburgh I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a nostalgic thing, because his restaurant is about to close, but the best thing this year was Pierre Koffmann\u2019s squid bolognese. It\u2019s a mindblowing dish. He\u2019s taken the idea of spaghetti bolognese, but there\u2019s no pasta involved. What you do is freeze the squid in a vacuum pack bag in one big block, then slice it very thinly on a meat slicer, which creates a kind of tagliatelle effect. The bolognese is the tentacles cooked in a rich tomato sauce. Some of the most ingenious things in life are the simplest. You can\u2019t take it out of the man, he just keeps creating. Jackfruit curry at Samakanda, Sri LankaMeera Sodha, food writer, author of Fresh India In January, I went to Sri Lanka and stayed at a tropical plantation in the south called Samakanda. One evening some local chefs climbed the trees in the garden, harvested some coconuts and tender baby jackfruit and made a curry. I\u2019d never eaten jackfruit before and I\u2019d been staring at these spiky green fruit in the sky wondering what they\u2019d taste like. They cooked the jackfruit in a clay pot over an open fire with onions, ginger, spices, coconut milk and a very sour ingredient called goraka. As you never just get one dish in Sri Lanka, we also had an aubergine and mustard pickle called brinjal moju, a cashew-nut curry, sambal and spiced rice, all washed down with an arak sour. But the jackfruit curry stood out: the sticky sweetness of the fruit was balanced by the sourness of the goraka, and together they cut through the creaminess of the coconut. It was a sensational dish.     Jackfruit curry chosen by Meera Sodha.

We thought they might go for something over-sleek but they haven\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not frou-frou and the food was really simple. They did this smoked jowl which was literally the piece of meat on a plate, with a lick of puree. It was proper proud cooking, as if to say, we know we can do this amazingly well so you don\u2019t need anything else. And it was fun to see people being really creative with smoke. Petit-beurre cakeTomer Amedi, head chef at the Palomar, London My wife made me a cake for my birthday in April. It\u2019s called a petit-beurre cake, after the French biscuits (which are very popular in Israel), and it\u2019s the most delicious thing in the universe. I used to have it when I was little. My wife knows it\u2019s one of my kryptonites: she made me a whole tray and I ate half of it by myself. It\u2019s basically a layer cake with vanilla cream and these biscuits, then you add shaved chocolate on top and then the biscuit becomes all mushy and nice. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s trashy, but it\u2019s so good. Cochinita pibil in Yucat\u00e1n, MexicoRen\u00e9 Redzepi, chef-patron, Noma, Copenhagen This summer, I went to a tiny little Mayan village called Yaxuna in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and had cochinita pibil. It\u2019s a very traditional dish made with a little pig, usually wild, that they hunt and then marinate in the seed of the achiote tree mixed with sour orange juice. It\u2019s then folded in banana leaves and cooked in a pit. We ate it in 35-degree heat with fresh tortillas, which Mayan women made on hot stones, accompanied by pickled onions, fresh coriander and habanero chillies (as a pale gringo, I could only have a few drops of the chilli marinade). The meat was moist and juicy and the acidity was just incredible. It was such a perfect mouthful \u2013 the best Mexican food I\u2019ve ever had. Bone-marrow arancini by Jacob Kenedy at the Oxford Symposium on Food and CookeryBee Wilson, food writer and historian At the Oxford Food Symposium, which I\u2019m the chair of, we always have themed meals, and this year the theme was offal. A lot of people thought it was going to be dreadful, but Jacob Kenedy, chef-patron at Bocca di Lupo, put together a total feast \u2013 one of those meals I\u2019ll remember all my life. The level of thought he put into it was just extraordinary. There was a lot of wordplay on the menu: it included ox-heart tomatoes, marrow-fat peas and kidney beans. He served red mullet livers, which he\u2019d been stockpiling for months at the restaurant, with bruschetta and peas. He made coda alla vaccinara, or Roman oxtail stew, and an extremely spicy stew of innards called u morzeddhu. But the thing that really stood out for me was an arancino (stuffed rice ball). I\u2019m not often a fan \u2013 I think they can be quite dry and disappointing compared to risotto \u2013 but this was a beautiful golden sphere, so saffrony, and when you opened it up it had bone marrow in the middle. It was so unctuous \u2013 sort of like having risotto Milanese with osso bucco all in one tiny, perfect element. Black rice with squid ink at El Pirata of Mayfair, LondonFred Sirieix, general manager, Galvin at Windows, London El Pirata of Mayfair is a lovely Spanish restaurant next to where I work. It\u2019s a traditional, no-frills tapas place that\u2019s been open for 22 years \u2013 if it were French it would be a bistro. The dish I love there is black rice with squid. They cook the rice in squid ink and a little bit of fish stock and it has a very delicate round flavour. I love the langoustine with tomato sauce, too, and breaded monkfish \u2013 oh, it\u2019s delicious. And such good value. I said to the manager, \u201cAre you mad?\u201d He said, \u201cFred, people like these prices and we\u2019re happy, too, we don\u2019t need to put the prices up.\u201d OK, fine by me. Oh, and the ham, I think it\u2019s the best that you can find in London. Don\u2019t take my word for it, go and try it out.     Squid chosen by Fred Sirieix. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Pan-fried cep with celeriac puree and shaved truffle at Timberyard, Edinburgh  Gill Meller, Head chef at River Cottage and author of Gather Timberyard is a family-owned restaurant \u2013 the father, mother, daughter and two sons are all involved and they were incredibly welcoming. One particular dish in the six-course lunch bowled me over. The chef had received a delivery of fresh ceps that morning. He\u2019d taken a thick slice from the middle of the mushroom and pan-fried it on both sides with salt and pepper, then served it warm with a tiny bit of celeriac puree and shaved truffle. Every mouthful was exceptional, partly because the mushroom was so fresh and pristine. It was the simplest dish you could imagine, but the way it was executed was just perfect. Watermelon in BeijingMichael Zee, author of Symmetry Breakfast In September, I went to stay with my sister who lives in Beijing. She was obsessed with watermelons, which are absolutely gargantuan in China \u2013 bigger than a beach ball. They\u2019re so big, you need help in the supermarket to put it into the trolley, and we had to carry our one home in a pram. The heart of the watermelon is the best bit. It was such a different texture to anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in the UK or America: the flesh was like sugar crystals. I just chopped it up and ate it by itself. It was so sugary and sweet, I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Duck breast with blackcurrant at Birch, BristolStephen Terry, chef-patron of the Hardwick, Abergavenny The couple who run Birch, Sam Leach and Beccy Massey, are young and very passionate. They grow a lot of the produce themselves, make their own bread, do their own butchery. The food is very simple and the place is unpretentious, which appeals to me \u2013 they\u2019re clearly putting their money into quality ingredients rather than fine china. We went in the springtime and every dish was a celebration of the season: we had some early rhubarb, we had snails. But the best thing was duck with blackcurrants and roasted carrots. It was the most amazingly cooked duck breast I\u2019ve had in my life. I asked if he\u2019d cooked it in a water bath and he said, no, just in the pan. It was beautiful. Sp\u00e4tzle at Rotstockh\u00fctte, Gimmelwald, SwitzerlandTrine Hahnemann, food writer and cook This summer I went hiking in the Swiss Alps. One day we walked for 12km, a lot of it uphill, and then came down into a valley where we found a little cafe that looked a bit like a shed. They made just a few dishes and one of them was homemade sp\u00e4tzle with cream, bacon and local cheese. I had it with a big glass of beer. Maybe it was the circumstances \u2013 I was really hungry from the long walk \u2013 but this dish was so good. It wasn\u2019t a foodie thing at all: it felt like the world hadn\u2019t touched this place for a long, long time. But it made me really happy. Veal brain at Le Baratin, ParisDominique Ansel, owner, Dominique Ansel Bakery, London It was in Paris this spring, at a small bistro called Le Baratin, that I had the best dish ever: veal brain, poached and seared, with lemon sauce and some small boiled potatoes. I love simple, home-cooked food and this was just spot on \u2013 unbelievably delicious and cooked to perfection. Le Baratin is a tiny place in Belleville, not fancy at all. There\u2019s an open kitchen and you can see the chef [Raquel Carena] working away, with just one other cook, while her husband manages the bar and front of house. She makes the kind of food I want to eat every day. I\u2019d like to go back very soon. Pumpkin tortelli at Dal Pescatore, Canneto Sull\u2019oglio, ItalyMassimo Bottura, chef-patron, Osteria Francescana, Modena, Italy None of the best things I ate this year involved luxury ingredients but they all had an emotional quality, which is very important to me. A few months ago I had a pumpkin tortelli at Dal Pescatore, not far from Modena, which reminded me of my youth and the flavours of my grandmother\u2019s cooking. It is savoury, spicy and sweet, so you have this feeling that you\u2019re almost eating a dessert at the pasta course. Maybe the pasta was more refined and the plate more elegant, but otherwise it was exactly like my grandmother made it. As soon as I tasted it, I was so emotionally touched, because it took me back to the memory of my youth. It was unbelievable: I almost cried.     Pumpkin tortelli chosen by Massimo Bottura. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Grilled starfruit in Sylhet, BangladeshNadiya Hussain, food writer and broadcaster My dad has a starfruit tree in his backyard in Bangladesh and when we were over there last month it was in season, which I was very excited about. My relatives were all laughing at me because they think starfruit is a nuisance \u2013 they don\u2019t really eat them because they\u2019re so tart, and when they become sweet they disintegrate very quickly. But it was such a treat to see them growing in abundance, and for the kids to pick them. They couldn\u2019t see where the star was, but then we sliced one up and they saw it and were like, \u201cAh, that\u2019s really cool.\u201d I\u2019d never cooked with starfruit before, but me and the kids dug a hole in my dad\u2019s front garden (which he doesn\u2019t know about because we filled it up afterwards) and took an old piece of metal mesh from my uncle\u2019s building site and built a fire. Then we grilled the starfruit with cinnamon and sugar, and ate it with all the kids in the village. We were just making it up as we went along, using whatever we had in the cupboard, but it was so good. Grilled starfruit, I can tell you, is really delicious. Roast Dexter ribeyeApril Bloomfield, chef-patron, the Spotted Pig and the Breslin Bar &amp; Dining Room, both New York Few things blew my mind this year, but one that did was this lovely beef I had at my friend Charlie Hart\u2019s farmhouse in Cornwall. He cooked us a Dexter ribeye roast with all the trimmings \u2013 lots of roast potatoes and vegetables \u2013 and it was all delicious, but the joint was the standout. Boy, was that thing beefy: the fat was the colour of good butter and the meat so tender and tasty. It was one of those moments where you have a connection with what you\u2019re eating \u2013 it kind of grabs you, stops you in your tracks, and makes you go, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s perfection!\u201d Fried reindeer moss sprayed with chocolate at Noma, CopenhagenSat Bains, chef-patron, Restaurant Sat Bains, Nottingham Take a snapshot of \u201cNordic\u201d cuisine right now, and people are still doing the kind of stuff Ren\u00e9 Redzepi was making five or six years ago. But what the guy himself is cooking these days, you can\u2019t call it Nordic. It\u2019s unique. This dessert blew my mind. I had it in August, when I was in town for the Mad festival, and, like all Ren\u00e9\u2019s food, it looks stunning. It comes on a bed of moss with slices of chocolate-covered dehydrated cep, which were amazing in their own right, but this lichen was something else: it\u2019s deep-fried, sprayed with chocolate and flavoured with, at a guess, pine oil. The first thing that hits you is the texture \u2013 it\u2019s like the most delicate Shredded Wheat imaginable \u2013 then all these flavours hit you all at once. It\u2019s incredible. I went back six weeks later, just to have it again. Scallops at F\u00e4viken, SwedenClare Smyth, chef I went to F\u00e4viken at the end of the summer and the whole dining experience was incredible. First, we sat at a log fire for aperitifs and snacks. Then we went upstairs and had a procession of courses \u2013 we probably ate 30 different things, though it didn\u2019t feel like a heavy meal. Everything was good but there were a few standouts. One was the most amazing plump scallop that was cooked on a big wood fire in the middle of the kitchen. They remove the skirt, then pour the juice back into the shell and serve it on some juniper wood. It\u2019s just a scallop \u2013 so simple \u2013 but it was the most succulent sweet thing. Towards the end, we went back down to the fire and they handed out a wonderful selection of sweets, petit fours, coffees and homemade drinks. Afterwards, we went out to a tipi to smoke cigars and drink cognac. Whole peking duck at Park Chinois, LondonJay Rayner, Observer restaurant critic The best all-round eating experience remains Riley\u2019s Fish Shack in Tynemouth and, having come so late in the year, it\u2019s unlikely to be beaten. But the best single food item has to be the whole peking duck at Alan Yau\u2019s homage to the famed dinner-dance clubs of Shanghai, Park Chinois, just off London\u2019s Berkeley Square. Is it cheap? God no. It\u2019s \u00a385, though that\u2019s for two at least. But blimey, it\u2019s good: crisp lacquered skin, the perfect thin layer of fat, sweet yielding meat. It\u2019s been said that the Chinese are the best at roasting duck. And this is quite simply the very best of the best. It could be more expensive. For \u00a3280 they\u2019ll bung on 50g of beluga caviar, but I really wouldn\u2019t bother.     Peking duck chosen by Jay Rayner. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Gaeng ki lek (beef and cassia leaf curry) at Bo.lan, BangkokAndy Oliver, chef/co-owner, Som Saa, London Before we opened the new Som Saa, the team went on a research trip to Thailand. For me, the meal at Bo.lan was the highlight of the entire visit, and this curry stood out even among all the other sublime dishes. It had sweetness from fresh coconut cream and this amazing artisan palm sugar that tastes a bit like a combination of butterscotch and honey, and that\u2019s balanced by the slight bitterness of fresh cassia and the fragrance of fresh makrut lime leaf. The beef was pretty special stuff, too \u2013 aged rump grilled until it was all smoky. When you\u2019re just off a flight from the UK and eat here, it smacks you square in the face \u2013 all those familiar Thai tastes and ingredients are turned up to 11, because they\u2019re fresh from the market that morning. Cuttlefish with summer truffle at Bak\u00e8, Torre dell\u2019Orso, ItalyJane Baxter, chef/co-owner, Wild Artichokes, Kingsbridge, Devon Bak\u00e8 is the kind of place that proves you shouldn\u2019t judge on appearances. It\u2019s behind a semi-deserted shopping centre on the outskirts of a quiet seaside town in Puglia \u2013 the only thing missing is tumbleweed \u2013 but you walk in and the place is packed: they had to bring in an extra table and move everyone around to make room for us. The owner\u2019s a bit of a local celeb \u2013 he invented the pentolo pan, for cooking large amounts pasta \u2013 but he\u2019s best known round these parts as a truffle hunter. It\u2019s a short menu: three or four pastas, a few mostly fishy mains, and a selection of antipasti, of which this dish was one. It\u2019s so simple: incredibly fresh cuttlefish sliced very thinly, then flash-fried and dressed with brilliant olive oil and summer truffles. The combination was staggering. Reuben sandwich at Black Axe Mangal, LondonTim Siadatan, chef/co-owner, Padella and Trullo, both London I\u2019ve eaten at Black Axe Mangal a lot in the past year \u2013 well, it is just 20 metres down the road from Trullo. Everything Lee Tiernan and the BAM team cook is excellent, but their take on the Reuben is the best I\u2019ve ever had. Everything in it \u2013 and I mean absolutely everything \u2013 is made in-house: the smoked pastrami, the brisket, the welsh rarebit mix for the cheese, the sauerkraut, the pickles and even the mustard. And it\u2019s all served in a homemade flatbread with a side of homemade crisps. It\u2019s totally awesome. Nathan Outlaw\u2019s lobster roasting juicesTom Adams, chef-patron, Pitt Cue, London, and Coombeshead Farm, Lewannick, Cornwall What with opening the new Pitt Cue and Coombeshead in 2016, I haven\u2019t had many meals out this year. Even so, there have been many memorable morsels along the way, and perhaps the most satisfying came during a dinner we held at the farm with Nathan Outlaw. I hadn\u2019t eaten much all day, and was running mostly on fumes and the occasional Malteser. After we sent out the main courses, there was a short respite before dessert, so I nipped out to the prep area, where we\u2019d moved the spent roasting trays. Some of Nathan\u2019s sweet, buttery, smoky lobster roasting juices were still in the trays, so I liberated a few slices of bread and took care of things. Roasting and resting juices are my holy grail, and these were some of the finest. Curried calves\u2019 brains, Farokh Talati pop-up, LondonGary Usher, chef-owner, Sticky Walnut, Chester; Burnt Truffle, Heswall, Wirral, Hispi, Manchester Farokh\u2019s day job is at St John Bread &amp; Wine in London, but on the side he runs these brilliant Persian and curry pop-ups \u2013 he\u2019s done a couple for us up at Sticky, but I\u2019m on-duty there, so only get a small taste. I had these brains in October, when he did a guest night at Black Axe Mangal in Highbury. He serves everything family-style, and you just dive into this amazing feast. These massala-spiced brains came with a wonderful tarragon mayo, and I must have eaten at least five of them all by myself \u2013 and I mean whole ones. We sometimes have brains on the menu at our places, but Farokh\u2019s spicing takes them to another level. Coffee ice-cream at Grom, MilanRuby Tandoh, food writer In May, I went to Italy with my girlfriend for five weeks and we must have had two ice-creams a day while we were there. We went to a couple of off-the-beaten-track places that were highly recommended, with an old man crushing pistachios with his bare hands or whatever, and to be honest they were underwhelming. The best was at a chain called Grom. I know being into a chain is very anti-foodie, but it was really amazing ice-cream. The one I remember most clearly was the first one I had: coffee and pistachio in a branch in Milan. I couldn\u2019t believe that a coffee ice-cream could taste like that \u2013 so dark and bitter but sweet as well. It was wonderful. In every town we went to after that, we\u2019d go to Grom.     Coffee ice-cream chosen by Ruby Tandoh. Illustration: Sarah Tanat-Jones    Lamb barbacoa at Rancho Seco, Malinalco, MexicoNieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho, head chef, Barrafina, London In September, I went to Mexico for a week, and spent three days in Malinalco learning about barbacoa \u2013 and no, it\u2019s not the same as barbecue. The guy smeared a glorious paste of herbs, spices and about 10 types of chilli all over half a lamb, then laid it on a rack over a big pot filled with chickpeas, carrots, tomatoes, onions, herbs, spices, chillies and water, so the fat would drip through. He covered the meat with agave leaves, put the pot in a hole filled with smouldering charcoal, covered everything with hay and left it. The next day, about 16 hours later, we had the soup from the pot, then the lamb with tacos and \u2026 Oh my god! Even though I was full, I just couldn\u2019t stop eating. It was my idea of heaven. And the guy still refused to tell me what was in his paste. Anchovy cicchetti at All\u2019Arco, VeniceAngela Hartnett, chef-patron, Murano, Cafe Murano and Merchants Tavern, London A few months ago, Russell Norman (Polpo) took a bunch of us over to Venice for a few days. We went to All\u2019Arco the morning after a lovely, but very long, night on the town. It\u2019s a bacaro near the Rialto, and while the others were chatting away over yet more drinks, I sat quietly at the bar and got stuck into the cicchetti. My memory\u2019s a little hazy, for obvious reasons, but three stood out: one topped with sea bass ceviche with oil and chilli, another with fontina, prosciutto and swiss chard, and these little squares of bread spread with glorious butter and topped with a single salted anchovy. That\u2019s all there was to it, but it was just the best. Soba noodles dipped in duck broth at Kanei, KyotoErchen Chang, chef/co-owner, Bao, London Kanei is in an unassuming house in a quiet residential neighbourhood. We were lucky, because we got to the front of the long queue just before they shut the doors \u2013 there are only 16 or so seats on the tatami, so it\u2019s pretty cosy. The four schoolboys next to us all seemed to know what they wanted and ordered straightaway, while this old guy sat behind us told me he\u2019d been eating here for 10 years. We had cold soba noodles with a rich, hot duck broth with three slices of pink duck breast floating in it. You dip the super-bouncy soba in the broth, and slurp. This dish was so simple, yet every part of it hit the spot and was so elegant. OFM Steamed flower crab, Tasting Court, Hong KongcorrectFuchsia Dunlop, cook and writer of Land Of Fish And Rice My dish of the year was steamed flower crab with golden chicken oil and Shaoxing wine, served on a rippled bed of smooth rice pasta. It was part of an exquisite Cantonese feast arranged by friends. Every dish was prepared with consummate artistry, among them lion\u2019s head meatballs and a perfect rendition of an old classic, braised pomelo skin with dried shrimp eggs. I think it\u2019s the best Cantonese meal I\u2019ve ever had, and the steamed crab was the highlight. Unforgettable. Chicken rice, Wee Nam Kee, SingaporeClaus Meyer, Food writer and co-founder, Noma Last winter, during a trip to Singapore, I had the best chicken in my life. The chicken itself was a 2kg free-range chicken of the very best quality. It was poached for 30 minutes in a gigantic pot full of chicken stock that I suspect had been cooking for decades and had been passed on from chef to chef, just like a sourdough is passed on from one generation to another. After 30 minutes, the chicken was taken out of the stock and put straight into water with ice to seal the melted fats and juices under the skin. The chicken was then kept at room temperature. The rice itself was cooked in chicken fat and then in chicken stock, and served with a black thick soy-like sauce and a chilli sauce made from freshly pounded chillis, ginger juice, garlic, lime juice, sesame oil and sugar. When the chicken melted in my mouth, tears came to my eyes.", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Restaurants"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-11T09:00:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/11/best-food-books-2016-observer-food-monthly", "sentences": ["Best of the rest Land of Fish and Rice Fuchsia Dunlop Bloomsbury, \u00a326An introduction to the food of Shanghai and the Lower Yangtze region brought to you by a gifted scholar and recipe writer.", "Beautifully written, brilliantly curated, a perfect present for an adventurous cook keen to expand their recipe repertoire.Buy it for: Shanghai red-braised pork with eggs."], "title": "The 20 best food books of 2016", "article": "Book of the year Sweetbitter Stephanie Danler One World, \u00a312.99 A coming-of-age novel that\u2019s as much about falling in love with the restaurant industry.

Related: Football transfer rumours: Cesc F\u00e0bregas to leave Chelsea for Roma?    The right-footed defender, capped 18 times by Spain, has been a consistently impressive performer in both full-back roles and more recently, as a third centre-half, with successive Chelsea managers having grown to depend upon his steady influence. Azpilicueta, who was signed from Marseille and has since won the Premier League, League Cup and Europa League with the club, has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract which commits him to the Blues until 2020. He is expected to play his 200th game at Sunderland on Wednesday as Conte\u2019s side seek a 10th league win in a row. \u201cI\u2019m pleased, and I\u2019m pleased for him,\u201d said Conte when asked about the defender committing his future to the club having been linked to Barcelona last summer. \u201cHe\u2019s impressed me a lot with his commitment, his work-rate, his ability to play also in different roles. He\u2019s a good professional and I\u2019m pleased for him, and above all the club and the fans. A really good player has signed. \u201cLook back, it was a good piece of business [bringing Azpilicueta in from Marseille] for us, for Chelsea. \u2018Azpi\u2019 is a really good player. Now, I think, his valuation is very high. He\u2019s an important player who can play in different roles, so it was a good affair for the club.\u201d The 27-year-old, a graduate of Osasuna\u2019s youth system and now a mainstay of Conte\u2019s team, expressed his delight at securing his future. \u201cSince I arrived here my target was to progress as a player and win trophies,\u201d he said. \u201cThis new contract gives me the chance to continue my relationship with the club. That\u2019s what I wanted and obviously I\u2019m really happy here. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really good moments this season. From day one, we started working very hard. We have a new manager with new ideas and I\u2019m really happy to be working with him. Obviously we can still improve but the long-term aim for us is to win trophies, that is what we all want, the players, manager and fans.\u201d Chelsea will not address John Terry\u2019s future until much later in the season, with talks yet to take place over whether the injured captain prolongs his stay by a further 12 months. The 35-year-old is expected to rebuff interest from Chinese Super League clubs, led by Shanghai Shenhua, during next month\u2019s window to play his part in the title challenge. \u201cJohn is our captain and I think he\u2019s doing a great job when he played,\u201d Conte added. \u201cNow that he\u2019s not playing, he\u2019s helping me a lot in the changing room, to send the right message to the players.

The Premier League leaders accepted that bid on the day they were fined \u00a3100,000 by the Football Association for the part they played in the touchline melee in stoppage time at Manchester City this month. The level of that sanction reflected the reality it was their fifth charge of failing to control their players within 19 months \u2013 City, who had two players sent off, must pay only \u00a335,000 \u2013 but did mean Chelsea avoided a points deduction for repeated breaches of rule E20a. The incident has, however, served as a reminder to Antonio Conte\u2019s side that the threat of the more severe punishment is real as they seek a 10th successive Premier League win, at Sunderland, on Wednesday. They are expected to be without Oscar for that game on Wearside, with the Brazilian understood to have told his team-mates he will leave at the end of the month. The 25-year-old had started the first five Premier League games of Conte\u2019s tenure, but has been reduced to a bit-part role since and has played 36 minutes, encompassing four substitute appearances, of the nine-match winning run.   Related: C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta extends Chelsea stay but Terry\u2019s situation stays on hold    Villas-Boas, who endured an unhappy eight-month spell in charge at Stamford Bridge, is a long-time admirer and had first attempted to sign the attacking midfielder, then with Internacional, for Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 2012 only for the Brazilian to opt to move to Chelsea in a \u00a319.5m deal. He has made 99 Premier League starts in the period since and won the Premier League, Europa League and League Cup. But, having grown frustrated on the fringes at Chelsea of late, he will now take up the lucrative new challenge in China. Both Guangzhou Evergrande, coached by another former Chelsea manager in Luiz Felipe Scolari, and Jiangsu Suning, who made their own interest known last summer, had continued to track Oscar, but Villas-Boas is confident he will be able to deflect any late rival bids and secure the player. Oscar will join his compatriots Hulk and Elkeson at Shanghai SIPG and expects to double his wages in China. Hulk, who is believed to earn more than \u00a3300,000 a week, is currently the club\u2019s record signing at \u00a348m, though that fee will now be eclipsed by the offer submitted for Oscar. It will be the second January in succession that Chelsea generate a substantial fee for one of their Brazilian contingent, having sold Ramires to Jiangsu Suning in last season\u2019s mid-winter window. That deal was worth in excess of \u00a320m, with the player signing terms worth around \u00a3200,000 a week. This sale would grant Conte considerable leeway in the market as he seeks to reinforce his squad, with interest likely to be expressed in the Southampton centre-half Virgil van Dijk. That potential move is more likely to progress at the end of the season, with the Dutch defender\u2019s club reluctant sellers. Regardless, the sale of Oscar will rule out any transfer for Cesc F\u00e0bregas mid-season, with Conte having reiterated on Tuesday that the Spaniard remains \u201can important player\u201d. Conte, more used to Italy\u2019s winter break, is about to experience his first festive programme of matches, with the Sunderland game a first of five in 22 days. As part of his preparations for that period he will seek to dissuade his squad from arranging a formal Christmas party amid the cluttered schedule, though he has revealed he is more than happy for his players to enjoy a beer immediately after games. David Luiz posted a video on Instagram on Sunday of the post-match celebrations in the dressing room at Stamford Bridge after the hard-fought 1-0 win against West Bromwich Albion, with the footage showing Costa dancing with a beer in hand. The head coach has apparently sanctioned one post-match drink, when players are still effectively burning calories after their exertions out on the pitch. \u201cAfter the game, for rehydration, you can drink Coca-Cola, or one beer,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for recovery. But one. Not a lot. And, after you finish the game, you must drink it quickly, not an hour after the end.\u201d Yet, while the club organise a festive event for the players and their families, Conte is more circumspect over his squad conducting their own pre-Christmas outing, conscious that focus must be on retaining the team\u2019s current momentum. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have great professionals in my players so, with that the case, I don\u2019t think a coach or a manager can say: \u2018Do this\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t do this\u2019,\u201d said the Italian, who will train his players on Christmas Day. \u201cI have great professionals and I know they will have the better attitude and behaviours in this situation. But, I must be honest, I\u2019d prefer they stayed at home and celebrated with the family. Not [have] a great party. \u201cWe are preparing to celebrate with our families during the week before Christmas, to stay together with our children, with our families, and on the 26th we play the game [against Bournemouth], a tough match. So maybe a glass of red wine \u2013 one \u2013 on Christmas Day is good.\u201d", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Antonio Conte", "Manchester City", "The FA", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-13T16:59:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/14/tough-draws-for-a-league-sides-in-asian-champions-league-group-stage", "sentences": ["To get into Group E, Brisbane will have to win at Shanghai Shenhua.", "Tony Popovic\u2019s side will also expect Shanghai SIPG, with coach Andre Villas-Boas and striker Hulk, to come through the play-offs."], "title": "Tough draws for A-League sides in Asian Champions League group stage | John Duerden", "article": "The Hilton Hotel in Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur, can be seen from the local LRT station but negotiating your way through car parks, government complexes and Malaysian back streets to actually get there can be tricky. It is a feeling familiar to Australian club officials who attended the draw for the 2017 Asian Champions League at the hotel on Tuesday. Brisbane Roar, Western Sydney Wanderers and Adelaide United know where they want to go but getting there is a different matter entirely.   Related: Adelaide United to face reigning champions Jeonbuk in ACL group stage    For Brisbane, entering the group stage is the first priority. To do that, the team will take on either Singapore\u2019s Tampines Rovers or Global from the Philippines, coached by former Crystal Palace goalkeeper John Burridge. The Queenslanders should be able to get through that initial play-off at home to book a one-off trip to China. To get into Group E, Brisbane will have to win at Shanghai Shenhua. John Aloisi could ask Tim Cahill for some inside info about his former club, although the obvious tactic of keeping Demba Ba, if he is fit, and Carlos Tevez, if he is signed, quiet is hardly a secret. It is a tough route to what is a decent group. Japanese champions Kashima Antlers (who actually finished third, 15 points behind Urawa Reds) are beatable and the same can be said of Thai title holders Muangthong United. The likely addition of the inexperienced, in continental terms, Jeju United is not a scary one either. Adelaide may be safely in their group already but getting out will be tough. After winning the A-League grand final earlier this year, excitement was high over a return to Asia given the 2008 finalists\u2019 special relationship with the continental competition. However, if sitting rock bottom of the A-League with a third of the season gone was not painful enough, now being placed in what could be the toughest group of all eight adds another challenge to an already stressful season for the Reds. United will not be the favourites to progress after being paired with the defending champions and one of the biggest spending and most ambitious clubs anywhere in the world. Jeonbuk Motors have played more games, won more games and been in the knockout stage more than any other team in the Asian Champions League. In November, the South Koreans added the 2016 title to their 2006 triumph and will be a force once again. Not quite as successful in continental terms but a bigger draw these days is Jiangsu Suning. This is a club that spent more in last winter\u2019s transfer window than any club of the big European leagues, except for England\u2019s top tier. There was around $100m spent on Brazilian stars Ramires from Chelsea and Alex Teixeira from Shakhtar Donetsk; and then former Manchester City striker J\u00f4 and Socceroo Trent Sainsbury did not come cheap. Such signings, especially the impressive Teixeira, took Jiangsu to second behind Guangzhou Evergrande, who won a sixth successive domestic title in October. Midway through the season, the team swapped coach Dan Petrescu for Choi Yong-soo of FC Seoul. Seoul themselves will face Western Sydney but is not quite the same soulless side that Wanderers faced in 2014 and 2015. This year, the Koreans were the top scorers in the group stage thanks to the striking prowess of Adriano and Dejan Damjanovi\u0107. Tony Popovic\u2019s side will also expect Shanghai SIPG, with coach Andre Villas-Boas and striker Hulk, to come through the play-offs.

This might seem like a fairly standard introduction to science fiction, but Liu read it under exceptional circumstances; this was at the height of the Cultural Revolution, in his native China, and all western literature was strictly forbidden. Now 53, Liu (western publishers present him as Cixin Liu to make it easier for readers to find his family name on the shelves) is a science-fiction writer of some renown, both in China and in the English-speaking world. His novel The Three-Body Problem won a Hugo award in 2015 and is currently being adapted into a movie, due in 2017. His sequel, The Dark Forest, was published in English in 2015, and the third book Death\u2019s End, has just been translated and released in the UK. But more than 40 years ago, growing up in a coal-mining city in the Shanxi province, a young Liu found the book that would alter the course of his life, hidden in an old box that once belonged to his father. \u201cNo science-fiction novels were published, and people did not have any notion of scientific imagery,\u201d Liu recalls. \u201cAt the time, almost all the translated novels from the west were strictly banned, so I had to read it in secret. This very book turned me into a sci-fi fan.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the late 1970s, when China experienced economic reform and the strictures on western literature were relaxed, that science fiction was translated widely into Chinese. With this came a sudden surge of Chinese authors writing in the genre \u2013 and Liu wanted to be one of them. But instead of studying literature, he got a job as a power-plant engineer in Yangquan. But what looks like a career diversion was entirely strategic: the stability of his career meant he could write, he says. \u201cFor about 30 years, I stayed in the same department and worked the same job, which was rare among people of my age. I chose this path because it allowed me to work on my fiction,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my youth, when I tried to plan for the future, I had wished to be an engineer so I could get work with technology while writing sci-fi after hours. I figured that if I got lucky, I could then turn into a full-time writer. Now looking back, my life path has matched my design almost precisely. I believe not a lot of people have this kind of privilege.\u201d     A cyclist passes in front of a factory in the Chinese town of Yangquan. Photograph: Reinhard Krause/REUTERS    His first novel, The Devil\u2019s Bricks, came out in 2002, but it wasn\u2019t until 2006 that he had his breakthrough, The Three-Body Problem. Initially serialised in the Chinese magazine Science Fiction World, the novel takes its title from a physics question in orbital mechanics and contains three intertwining plots, set respectively during 1971 in the Cultural Revolution, in the mid-2000s and on a distant world in a three-sun system.    Technological and social changes that took centuries in the west have been come in two generations in China  Ken Liu     The success of Liu\u2019s novel is credited with inspiring a new surge in sci-fi writing; in 2012 alone, nearly 200 new titles were published in China. Seven years after its initial publication, The Three-Body Problem was brought to a western audience by Tor Books in New York in 2013. It was translated by the Boston-based author Ken Liu (no relation). In his translator\u2019s note, Ken writes: \u201cThe act of translation involves breaking down one piece of work in one language and ferrying the pieces across a gulf to reconstitute them into a new work in another language. When the gulf separating the two is as wide as the Pacific Ocean \u2026 the task can be daunting. The Chinese literary tradition shaped and was shaped by its readers, giving rise to different emphases and preferences in fiction compared to what American readers expect.\u201d What western readers expect of Chinese science fiction is a curious issue. Western eyes have a tendency to view China as a dystopia, or full of \u2018eastern\u2019 mysticism. But Ken says it\u2019s a mistake to read Chinese SF in this way; if there\u2019s one common theme in Chinese SF, it is \u201cimbalance\u201d. \u201cContemporary China is a complex society in transition. The kinds of technological and social changes that took societies in the west centuries to move through have sometimes been experienced by a mere two generations in China,\u201d he says. \u201cThe anxiety of careening out of balance, of being torn by parts moving too fast and too slow, is felt everywhere. While entrepreneurs, researchers, and megacorps in Beijing and Shanghai are pushing the boundaries of advanced technology \u2026 at rates sometimes far ahead of the west, just a few hundred miles away, children left behind in rural villages by parents who have gone to the great cities in search of low-wage jobs grow up on bare concrete floors without toys, without books, without basic nutrition, without even the support of crumbling traditional extended families and folk beliefs.\u201d     Ken Liu, writer and translator. Photograph: Lisa Tang Liu    Liu says it\u2019s a mistake to think that Chinese SF doesn\u2019t share common tropes with its western equivalents. \u201cWe can safely say that all themes once explored in the American and European sci-fi genre have found their manifestation in the Chinese counterpart \u2013 things like space exploration, alien contact, artificial intelligence, and life science. Problems of modern development are also addressed, like environmental hazards and the negative effects coming from new technologies. Yet Chinese sci-fi does have its own unique themes as well, such as the attempt to re-deduce and re-display the ancient history of China from a sci-fi angle.\u201d The Three-Body Problem was the first full-length Chinese SF work to be translated into English, just two years ago. But a wide and burgeoning school of SF writing dates back to the end of the Cultural Revolution, arguably as far back as 1978, with the publication of short story Death-Ray on the Coral Island by Tong Enzheng, in China\u2019s prestigious literary magazine People\u2019s Literature. Liu says that a national obsession with sci-fi began around 1983. \u201cSome of the works even sold as many as four million copies. There were even debates on whether sci-fi ought to belong to the domain of science or of literature; Chinese authors made effort to pull it back to its literary origin, attempting to change the way that sci-fi had been treated as a mere tool for disseminating scientific knowledge.\u201d While the harsh reality that saw the young Liu having to read Jules Verne in secret is four decades gone in China, there is still the ever-present shadow of government censorship. Liu says he and his publisher were concerned about potential issues with The Three-Body Problem, which deals with the Cultural Revolution itself. \u201cIt was a sensitive topic and therefore we were worried about related contents causing trouble. However, the book has been out for 10 years now, and we have never had any censure from the authorities,\u201d he says. \u201cMany government officials have read the book.\u201d So far, Liu has \u201cnever encountered pressure or intervention from the government during my writing process and the publication of my stories\u201d; its attention is reserved for films, he says. And with next year\u2019s movie version, Liu\u2019s star is set to rise even further. \u201cThis will be the first big-budget sci-fi film in China,\u201d he says. \u201cMany people hold high expectations for it, hoping that it will become China\u2019s 2001: Space Odyssey or Star Wars. But personally I feel that such an expectation for the first attempt of the nation\u2019s film industry might be unrealistic. I\u2019d rather watch this process unfold with a calm attitude, treating it like a positive start for China\u2019s sci-fi films.\u201d He remains mildly surprised by the success of The Three-Body Problem outside China. \u201cAll we had hoped for was just to let American readers become aware that there is sci-fi in China. Now that it has been embraced by readers in the UK and the US, it supports an idea I once had: sci-fi as a literary vessel is the most global, the most universal [storytelling], with the capability to be understood by all cultures. Sci-fi novels are concerned with problems faced by all of humanity. Crises in sci-fi mostly threaten humanity as a whole. This is a unique and treasurable trait inherent in the genre \u2013 that the human race is perceived as a single entity, undivided.\u201d  Death\u2019s End, the third book in the Three-Body Problem series, is published in the UK by Head of Zeus, priced \u00a318.99. It is available from the Guardian bookshop for \u00a315.17, including free UK p&amp;p. Invisible Planets, edited by Ken Liu, is out now from Head of Zeus.

I lived there for 25 years and would often take a short nap and go out at midnight to enjoy a sleeping city filled with atmosphere, deserted spaces, panoramic vistas, foggy and forlorn images of trees and distant expanse of water. Time was different at night in sleeping San Francisco.  The city was so crowded during the day I could not enjoy it, I had no sense of presence. At night the real city is laid bare, seemingly forgotten and empty, even while occupying the same physical space of the daytime city.

These were often out of necessity as late night transport was pretty much non-existent at the time, and I was young and too impoverished to pay for a taxi or minicab. I lived off Ladbroke Grove and these walks would usually take me through the squares of Bayswater or Holland Park \u2013 the trees luminescent in the streetlights or along the edge of Hyde Park with the dew starting to fall. These walks stay with me today \u2013 probably some of my happiest times ever.

(SuperbMeteor) \u2018Walking through Athens at night is very peaceful\u2019 I walk miles in Athens at night and love it. Especially around the Acropolis, through Plaka and Thissio. There is a dirt track between the two agoras which hardly anyone uses at night. It\u2019s very peaceful, and Athens is a very safe city. Walking in the daytime here can be a nightmare. I still love this city though, and walking through it at night is one of my favourite pastimes \u2013 especially in winter when the streets are so very quiet.

The night smells different. You can sometimes hear underground streams flowing. It\u2019s nice to be rewarded with the discovery of new places even if it\u2019s only an all-night cafe. Wildlife is everywhere, particularly foxes but also urban owls, badgers and deer. I am something of an insomniac. My sleep pattern is very disrupted but I just embrace it.

(koelner) \u2018Night walks are an excellent break from our increasingly digital lives\u2019 When I first moved to London, I worked as a bartender in Shoreditch, usually until 1 or 3am. The noise left my veins tingling, my head buzzing for hours afterwards. Sober, the night bus felt like a continuation of the night shift, a busman\u2019s holiday full of late night drinkers and cans of lager. So, although it took almost an hour, I often walked home to unwind from the buzz of London\u2019s nightlife \u2013 to decompress, to breathe.  Walking from Shoreditch to Upper Clapton, I discovered a different side to my new city, a quieter side. A London of sleeping tower blocks, peaceful parks, street lamps twinkling in the night. In its own way, the commute was actually quite a privilege. Few people are able to walk home from their jobs, and London at night is infinitely more beautiful than a view of someone\u2019s armpit on the Tube.  Night walks are an excellent tonic for the stress and busyness of London, and a break from our increasingly digital lives. Approached with curiosity and openness, a night walk can be just as compelling as a TV box set before bed, and more nourishing than your smartphone\u2019s news feed. Night walking gives me a fresh perspective on a city that has now become familiar, and when I make time for it, I always sleep better.

I love that the light is beautiful, even on a bright Scandinavian summer night; that you feel outside of the world. I have worked as a tram driver in Oslo, working until 1.30am or starting at 4.30am. I have seen the city go to sleep and awake many times. I\u2019ve seen people going for their morning run in complete darkness, and the birds eating kebab leftovers on Sunday morning before the street cleaners arrive; I\u2019ve seen tired people coming home from late evening shifts, watching warily out of the window. I have seen many beautiful sunsets and sunrises at wildly different times. (Anonymous) \u2018In the midst of all the activity, there is calm\u2019 I love the neon whirl of Shanghai during a night stroll through older parts of the city just west of the Bund, teeming with old neighbourhoods winding down for the evening. In the midst of all the activity, there is always this sense of calm. (Gordon Steel) \u2018I\u2019d hate to only know a city based on experiences during the day\u2019 I fall in love with London more and more when exploring at night. In my teenage years, London at night was how I discovered it independently for the first time \u2013 how I really made it my city. At night you\u2019re free to walk to places you otherwise wouldn\u2019t go \u2013 because fewer people means more space, and partly because you\u2019re not being watched. You have to find your own entertainment at night when everything is closed, and so you explore more. In some ways I can appreciate cities more once I know about them at after dark. Daytime London (or any other city) is only half of what the place has to offer. It\u2019s a giant playground after dark \u2013 especially in the early hours. I\u2019d hate to only know a city based on experiences during the day. (Bmorris)     \u2018I love the neon whirl of Shanghai during a night stroll\u2019: pedestrians on the Bund. Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters    \u2018The night reveals a fantastical Amsterdam\u2019 After sunset at Amsterdam\u2019s phantasmagorical Leidseplein the throngs of nocturnal revellers bask in the neon glow radiating from various bars and coffee shops. To wade into this mass, to pass through, offers the nocturnal walker solitude in a sea of strangers. One can hide in plain sight. The night reveals a fantastical Amsterdam. If the night owl was to walk 10 minutes away from Leidseplein, to banish the bright lights to the rear view mirror, they would be greeted with canals and beautiful houses. Over water, humped bridges arch, bejewelled with delicate lights while spanning the murky straights. By day, brown, by night, black and silver, the water of Van Gogh. The interplay of the soft light with the last vestiges of autumnal foliage drastically alters the old city\u2019s essence, transporting the night walker to a different Amsterdam. The night walk is a free experience, and one out of the ordinary in the environment where capital rules all. For one to turn a corner and witness the unfurling of a canal, touched by the moonlight, soundtracked by a keen breeze, is an experience that warms the soul on cold winter nights.

We entered everywhere we found a door open or someone awake and weird enough to let us in. On the longest night we got sequestered in a newspaper\u2019s office by a limp guard who threatened us with handcuffs. He ended up making us sandwiches in exchange for stories about Che Guevara.

The deep shadows cast by overhead lamps turn the most ordinary scene into a Cartier-Bresson magical print, eerie and atmospheric. I can walk against the cold night air, becoming a character from a movie; my high heels click and echo against the closed doors and windows, my thoughts my own. I can become anyone, anywhere, observing, reciting poetry in my head, looking at the stars. I don\u2019t have to be cold and lonely inside. At night I can walk by myself and be anyone.

Yes, among the tenements, villas and the large Riegrovy Sady Park, reside two large panthers beside a tennis court. Sometimes you can meet them on the street being walked and at other times, in the pure still of the night, just a few hundred metres from the centre of the town, the silence is ripped apart by a large throaty panther scream. Got to love that! (Andrew Mann)     \u2018Cities reveal themselves differently at night.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy    \u2018The darkness is kind to me and my anxieties\u2019 I continue to wander the streets of my city at night, despite warnings that I could be putting myself in danger. I feel absolutely safe by myself in the darkness. On the rare occasions I do come across another nocturnal wanderer, we seemingly glide past one another, each in their own safe and soft cushion of darkness. The darkness is kind to me and my anxieties. It is not ostentatious, but subtle and unobtrusive. (Anonymous) \u2018At night the city is more imaginative\u2019 Cities reveal themselves differently at night than they do during the day. The day brings cities and their full agglomerative forces out to bare, and can overwhelm as much as fascinate. Details get lost in the fullness of the city. At night, the city is clothed, austere, and, in some ways, just as we are at night, more playful and imaginative. The stillness of the post-bar, pre-cafe hours amplifies the scale and ambitions of urban life. Only when absent of population can one understand cities truly are mankind\u2019s greatest invention.  I lived for sometime in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. There \u2013 outside of a few drinking dens \u2013 the nightlife revolves around roadside food and tea stalls, roaming men with guitars, and motorbikes. Strict residential gender segregation forces amorousness into the city\u2019s public spaces. Food can be found throughout the night, and any local student has a thick mental map of what time, and how spicy, the food stalls open at 3am are.   Related: 'A good wander unveils the wonder of a city': readers on urban walking    Last summer, I delivered the weekly alternative newspaper from the hours of 2.45am until 6am on Wednesday mornings in downtown Portland. Using my nauseous and sleep-deprived body in the crisp summer air, I would work myself into a strange funk of constant menial mental calculations, routing strategies, and memory excavations. For those few hours, the world was just the city and me and my memories. In our distracted and efficient and busy city life it\u2019s amazing how many memories we all have across urban landscapes that get lost under posts, emails, and Google map suggestions. And how much can shine through, come out of nowhere, and smack you \u2013 if you let it. Working at night made me see the city in a way I hadn\u2019t since I begrudgingly accepted other people existed, at about age seven. Cities excite me in their vibrancy, diversity, density, and exaggerations of human capability. But, I love most their potential for fleeting and totally thrilling, solitude.

Which was an odd choice, since Patterson won a gold medal at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952 and the heavyweight championship of the world, twice. But then a champion\u2019s legacy can be defined by the few contests he lost as well as the many he won. And Patterson was beaten twice by Sonny Liston, in the defining fights of his life, and twice more by Muhammad Ali. He was a great boxer who had the bad luck to live in an era when others were greater still. Talese\u2019s profile was a study in defeat, of what happens to a champion when he runs into an opponent just that much better. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to do anything in victory,\u201d Patterson once said, \u201cit\u2019s in defeat that a man reveals himself.\u201d If Andy Murray\u2019s career had ended in the summer of 2013, he would still have gone down as one of the greatest of all British sportsmen. Like Patterson, he was an Olympic champion, and he was the first British man to win Wimbledon since Fred Perry in 1936. But having scaled those heights, Murray travelled on in search of peaks beyond. And he found himself, like everyone else, chasing after Novak Djokovic. Murray beat Djokovic in the final when he won Wimbledon in 2013, then lost 12 of their next 13 matches. The one victory was at the Canadian Open in 2015, in the middle of a good year for Murray. He won his first clay court titles, in Munich and Madrid, led Great Britain to victory in the Davis Cup, and finished the year as the world No2. Trouble was, it was an even better one for Djokovic, who won the Australian Open, Wimbledon, the US Open, six Masters events, and lost only five matches all year. The question for Murray at the start of 2016 was what he could do to narrow the gap between himself and the player many reckoned to be one of the best of all time. And at first, he did not seem to have a ready answer.   Related: Andy Murray's path to becoming world tennis No 1 \u2013 in data    In January Djokovic beat Murray in straight sets in the final of the Australian Open, a match Murray described as \u201cthe worst I\u2019ve ever played\u201d. It seemed, Kevin Mitchell wrote, \u201cthat Djokovic does everything Murray does only better.\u201d Murray had a lot on his mind. It had been a difficult fortnight. His father-in-law, Nigel Sears, had collapsed while he was watching a match on Rod Laver Arena. Murray spent a night beside him in hospital, and would have withdrawn if Sears had not recovered as well as he did. All the while his wife, Kim, was back home, pregnant with their first child, who was born in early February. It got worse. Murray lost to Federico Delbonis in Indian Wells, and Grigor Dimitrov in the Miami Open, when he smashed his racket on court. There was talk he had fallen out with his coach, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo. He denied it but they split after Murray lost to Djokovic again in the final of the Madrid Open. The fallout lingered until the French Open, when Mauresmo spoke about Murray\u2019s grumpy manner on court, and left everyone trying to make sense of what had gone on between them. In the meantime, Jamie Delgado took over as his coach. And at the Rome Masters, he helped Murray get some revenge. He beat Djokovic, 6-3, 6-3, in an hour and 35 minutes. Djokovic had played a three-hour semi-final the night before, and was furious about the state of the court. But still, here was some hope. Swiftly extinguished at the French Open, when Djokovic beat him again, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. Murray had recently said \u201cif the top players win the first set they\u2019re winning 95% of the time\u201d, but this was one of the rare exceptions. He seemed feverish all through the tournament, was pushed to five sets by Radek Stepanek in the first round, then again by the world No164 Mathias Bourgue in the second. It was around this time he was memorably described as \u201ca walking existential crisis\u201d by Louisa Thomas in the New Yorker.     Murray celebrates beating Tomas Berdych at Wimbledon. Photograph: Steve Paston/PA    Murray asked Ivan Lendl if he was interested in working together again. Soon Lendl, inscrutable as rock, implacable as the tide, was back in Murray\u2019s box. He won his next 22 matches, a run that saw him sweep to a fifth victory at Queen\u2019s, win his third grand slam and his second Olympic title. At Wimbledon, everything changed on the middle Saturday, when Djokovic lost to Sam Querrey. A different kind of pressure came down on Murray. For the first time in his life, he started the second week of a grand slam as the favourite to win the title. He was ready for it. He needed five sets to beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga but only three apiece for Tomas Berdych and Milos Raonic.   Related: Johanna Konta: Juan Coto is still very much a part of everything I do    In Rio, Murray carried the Great Britain flag at the opening ceremony, and spoke about how much he loved to play for his country. \u201cIt\u2019s brought the best out of me throughout my career,\u201d he said. And it did again. Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro had seen off Djokovic in the first round. Then Murray beat Del Potro in the final, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 over four hours of absorbing play in front of 10,000 raucous fans. He hardly had a chance to celebrate but sped from the stadium to the airport, muttering apologies that he had to catch a flight to Cincinnati. There he lost to Marin Cilic in the final, his first defeat since the French Open final. Then in New York the following week he was beaten in five sets by Kei Nishikori, his 27th match in 57 days. Del Potro got his own back in the Davis Cup, when Great Britain were knocked out in the semi-finals. Murray took a short break, and then set off again, his mind fixed on overhauling Djokovic in the world rankings. He was in second place but almost 5,000 points behind, which meant he was closer to sixth-placed Raonic. Most felt he would not be able to catch up till next year. But from October through to December, Murray was unbeatable. He won the China Open, the Shanghai Masters, the Vienna Open, and the Paris Masters, where he overtook Djokovic and became the world\u2019s top-ranked tennis player. Finally, at the ATP World Tour Finals, Murray beat Cilic, Nishikori, Wawrinka, Raonic in short order and, at last, Djokovic himself, 6-3, 6-4. It was his eighth title of the year, and his fifth in a row. Twelve months earlier, Murray had been asked what he could possibly do to beat Djokovic. Not much, but \u201cmaybe he\u2019ll have a drop off,\u201d Murray said. And Djokovic did. Murray spotted the opening and pursued it mercilessly, with the best tennis of his career. He is a great fight fan himself, and would appreciate the way Patterson put it all those years ago: \u201cThey said I was the fighter who got knocked down the most.

Especially if the offer is amazing. And, for sure, this market is an incredible market.

Sometimes it\u2019s very difficult to face this situation. But I think, also, that we are in the best league. Now, to arrive in the Premier League is a great opportunity for players and for coaches, to fight for the title against fantastic players and coaches.

In this league, if we\u2019d arrived here today without the right concentration and focus, the will to fight and go into battle with our opponents, we\u2019d have lost this game for sure.

Pell\u00e8 will apparently earn \u00a334m in two and a half years, which breaks down to \u00a3260,000 a week, reputedly putting him in the top five best-paid footballers in the world, while leaving the firm impression that whoever runs Shandong hadn\u2019t noticed the second L in his surname.

It is the same now in China and it did raise a smile when Ramires, on his way out of Chelsea earlier this year, insisted the huge financial incentives had not underpinned his transfer to the Chinese Super League. No, presumably every young boy from Rio de Janeiro grows up dreaming of playing for Jiangsu Suning, in the nation that has just lost a World Cup qualifier at home to Syria \u2013 a country, you might imagine, that has other things on its mind than putting out a football team. Oscar, an increasingly peripheral figure at Chelsea, is the latest to be tempted and, however much his impending \u00a360m transfer to Shanghai SIPG is dressed up, it is difficult not to think it deeply unsatisfying to see someone of his age abandoning any real sense of ambition and, without wishing to be too cruel, a certain amount of respectability. At 25, he is approaching what should be the greatest years of his career, even if it seems apparent they will not be with his current club. He is also exceedingly rich already, most people would assume, after four and a half years on Chelsea\u2019s payroll, and surely talented enough to attract potential buyers from Europe\u2019s top leagues. Good luck to him, I suppose, but however many noughts are added to his salary, I do wonder how much job satisfaction there can be for a footballer with his gifts at a level several rungs down even from Major League Soccer.   Related: Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte: Chinese Super League is a danger to all teams    If that sounds slightly harsh, the reality is we are probably just going to have to get used to players heading that way, judging by the mind-boggling amounts on offer, and presumably it won\u2019t be too long before a high\u2011profile English footballer is added to the number. Wayne Rooney has already had one offer and, though it didn\u2019t get very far at all, he hasn\u2019t completely ruled out the idea of China even if, money aside, he hasn\u2019t heard too much that is appealing. Rooney\u2019s advisers went on a fact\u2011finding mission to China last spring and reported back that the pitches were appalling, the standard as bad as everyone thought, and the referees even worse, in a league blackened by tales of match-fixing and bribery. Rooney might also remember Manchester United\u2019s pre-season friendly against FC Shenzhen in Macau in 2007 and what came out, four years later, about the referee taking 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (roughly \u00a38,000) to fix the coin toss. Yet the key detail is what a climb-down it would be, football-wise, for someone whose career has been spent at the high end of the Premier League. The money is sensational but, to remember the old Rodriguez song, a monkey in silk is still a monkey. The difference between Rooney and Oscar is that one is skidding towards the end of a rapidly decelerating career whereas the other should be five or six years away from the point where he might be thinking about one last payday. That is the shame of it all, why Jamie Carragher has called it embarrassing and why, unless there is a late change of heart, it feels like such a waste that a super-rich footballer would follow the yuan rather than stay in Europe and play in the competitions that really matter to the people in his profession.   Related: Graziano Pell\u00e8 and glory v money: would you turn down \u00a334m in his position? | Nick Miller    Yaya Tour\u00e9 is often accused of being driven by ego and money \u2013 mostly, it ought to be said, because of a particularly dislikable agent, rather than the player himself \u2013 but it is not widely known the Manchester City midfielder turned his back on one offer from China last summer that would have earned him, after tax, \u00a3360,000 per week. Tour\u00e9 simply decided he was already an extremely wealthy man, that he would earn huge wages anyway and that, at the age of 33, he still wanted to be involved in a competitive league rather than one where its star imports counted their dosh but, in sporting terms, found little satisfaction. Rio Ferdinand was the same when he left Manchester United and had money-spinning offers from teams in China, the Gulf and the United States. He opted for QPR and hopefully Alexis S\u00e1nchez will also decide that life in London is preferable for a category-A footballer now he is a target of China. S\u00e1nchez could feasibly earn \u00a3400,000 a week but it would be disappointing, in the extreme, if it turns out we have misjudged him and he decides the higher salary would be better for him, career-wise, than earning millions with Arsenal instead. To give him his due, there is nothing to suggest that is the case, but not everyone thinks the same, plainly. Alex Teixiera could have moved to Liverpool before pitching up at Jiangsu Suning. Gervinho, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Demba Ba, Papiss Ciss\u00e9, Jackson Mart\u00ednez and Hulk all now play in the country where Paul Gascoigne once had a two-week trial at one club \u2013 \u201cThe name escapes me now,\u201d he wrote, rather brilliantly, in his autobiography \u2013 and a brief spell at Gansu Tianma. In Oscar\u2019s case, he has clearly been shunted to the edges at Chelsea since Antonio Conte took control, and the natural comeback in these kind of debates is to ask how many people in any walk of life would say no to trebling their wages \u2013 for the Brazilian, increasing his salary to \u00a3350,000 a week.   Related: Antonio Conte wants special future after Chelsea beat Crystal Palace    All the same, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger made a good point recently, discussing Arsenal\u2019s contract negotiations with Sanchez, when he said the Premier League\u2019s top players were hardly on a pittance anyway and needed to be careful about getting their priorities in the wrong order. \u201cI believe personally, and maybe I am a bit naive, that it\u2019s more about getting to meet the player\u2019s needs \u2026 the way the club has values, the way the club has ambition, the way the club respects the players,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThe money is good everywhere for everybody.\u201d Maybe I am a bit naive, too, but I cannot help agree. Oscar is too good for China. It is no place for any footballer with genuine ambition and surely, if he has to leave Chelsea, he could find another club that allows him to be a multimillionaire, with everything done for him and all the superstar\u2019s accessories, in a country where the sport is not a national embarrassment. China\u2019s defeat to Syria in October finished with swarms of people protesting on the streets, just as they did in 2013 after the national team lost 5-1 against a Thai youth side and their Spanish coach, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho, resigned in disgrace. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has made it clear he wants to start the country\u2019s rise as a football power, meaning the sport is now a compulsory part of the national curriculum and tens of thousands of new pitches are being created, but it will take many years before they catch up. The wages are out of this world but they probably have to be because any top-level player heading to China might just find this is the point when the rest of football stops taking their careers seriously. Clarke redefining transparency Greg Clarke, chairman of the Football Association, did not make any attempt to downplay the seriousness of the child sexual-abuse scandal and the potential repercussions for the relevant clubs and, indeed, his own organisation. Everybody at the FA knew the importance of getting this one right, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the biggest crisis I can remember and we\u2019re trying to be completely transparent.\u201d Clarke was formerly the chairman of the Football League and you might remember him promising transparency back then, too. \u201cI have a propensity to think that transparency is a wonderful thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see countries and companies who are not transparent, terrible things happen.\u201d Absolutely. And now here he was again, in his new role, promising everything would be out in the open and the FA, conducting its own inquiry, would keep us all in touch. \u201cWe will bring information to the public domain as quickly as possible,\u201d he added, reassuringly. Except this was 29 November and, as we know now, four days earlier the FA suspended Dario Gradi, director of football at Crewe Alexandra, from all football-related activities. Clarke, promising transparency and an open line of information, had stood in front of the television cameras and somehow failed to mention it once. On 6 December I wrote that the FA intended to interview Gradi about what he knew and, before and after publication, had several conversations with the governing body. Again, no mention was made that Gradi, by that stage, was 11 days into his suspension. In fact, the FA still hasn\u2019t uttered a word on the subject \u2013 not even a one-line confirmation \u2013 despite it being reported everywhere and even though Crewe, possibly the least transparent club I have ever dealt with, have put out a brief statement. Is this the FA\u2019s idea of transparency? It feels more like a deliberate attempt to hush everything up, which is precisely what the FA promised it would not do. Perhaps Clarke thought nobody would notice when Gradi stopped turning up for matches but more fool us, I suppose, if we were daft enough to believe the FA might actually mean it this time. For the time being, it feels about as transparent as a pint of Guinness and, on a similar theme, it would be appreciated if the FA could be good enough to explain what a suspension from all football\u2011related activities actually entails. Sorry to be pedantic, but it does feel like a relevant question when the man who has supposedly been told to keep away from the sport is filmed going in and out of his club\u2019s ground. Rowett\u2019s swings and roundabouts   Related: Gianfranco Zola in last chance saloon but relishing challenge at Birmingham    Gary Rowett has had a lot of sympathy, understandably, over the last few days, bearing in mind the nature of his sacking at Birmingham City and the announcement of Gianfranco Zola\u2019s appointment with barely enough time in between for the last man to clear out his office. It is a cut-throat business and, not for the first time, it makes me wonder whether the League Managers Association, so quick to criticise clubs for the speed at which they hire and fire, should remember its own members can be pretty ruthless, too. At the same time, it is probably worth pointing out that when Jos\u00e9 Riga was at Blackpool, already suffering the excesses of the club\u2019s ownership, Rowett not only spoke to the Oyston family about nabbing his job but also cheerfully announced as much on the website of Burton Albion, his club at the time. That was the first time Riga found out that interviews were taking place for a job he had not even vacated.

Vladimir Putin in Russia, Xi Jinping in China, Narendra Modi in India and Donald Trump in the US. What explains the rise of the strongman, or woman? Why is liberal democracy being tested in so many countries by rightwing demagogues who seem to care very little for the liberal part. Hungary and Poland can no longer be called liberal democracies. Forthcoming elections in France and the Netherlands will show whether an autocratic one-man party (Geert Wilders\u2019s Freedom party), or an illiberal far-right party (Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National), will cause upsets in western Europe. The claim that people have the governments they deserve has always struck me as a little unfair. Russians didn\u2019t choose Stalin. Chairman Mao was never elected. Opposition against Putin never had much chance. Nonetheless, the number of people craving a strongman may be larger than nice liberals, such as myself, like to admit. There might be a parallel to be drawn with the common desire for organised religion, which waxes and wanes but never disappears. Not that every form of religious faith is inherently authoritarian. But most religions offer safety in numbers, a sense of belonging, a dream of salvation, if not in this life, then in the next, and the patriarchal reassurance that our future is in the good hands of wise deities and their representatives on Earth. Strongmen and populist leaders rely on charisma more than expertise and well-thought-out policies. In times of stress, when large numbers of people fear the future for whatever reason, such leaders offer the same kind of reassurance that religious authority does. Expertise becomes at best an irrelevance and at worst a dirty word. Sometimes, typical strongmen harness traditional religion to their causes. Modi came to power in India riding a wave of Hindu chauvinism. When he is not riding horses without his shirt on, Putin presents himself as the champion of Russian orthodoxy doing battle with the decadence of a degenerate west. Xi\u2019s references to Confucianism may be half-hearted, but he too claims the mantle of a traditional Chinese ruler purging his country of noxious influences from the barbarian world. Misguided western policies \u2013 pushing the borders of Nato too far, too soon \u2013 might have contributed to the successful branding of Putin as a national saviour. And western intervention (Iraq), or possibly lack of intervention (Syria), has made a bloody mess of the Middle East, where dictators still thrive. The rise of China would have happened, whatever the western powers might have done. Of all forms of modern autocracy, the Chinese is perhaps the most insidious, because unlike the Soviet Union, it is so successful, at least in a material sense. Even some provincial Chinese airports make JFK in New York City look like a relic of the developing world. Now that the US, under Trump, is likely to lose both the will and the credibility to protect its democratic allies, China\u2019s domination, at least in Asia, will be unstoppable. To the Chinese, this is no more than a natural reversion to the old order, when peripheral people and barbarians needed to pay deference to the Middle Kingdom\u2019s rulers. Some dictators \u2013 Hitler, Mao \u2013 became the gods of their own cult as a substitute for traditional religions. They, too, loathed educated experts and critics, who were treated as infidels to be burned at the stake, as it were.     Shanghai, a symbol of China\u2019s material success. Photograph: Alamy    The decline of the western order has coincided with western democracies being managed by a variety of experts, or technocratic elites, who were less interested in projecting dreams of the future, let alone salvation, than in finding bureaucratic solutions to immediate problems. The European Union, it is true, rests on a postwar dream of peace and brotherhood, but it, too, is largely run by well-meaning bureaucrats who are failing to reassure anybody. In a state of anxiety, many people no longer trust the experts. They want the comfort that only charismatic leadership can provide, the powerful father figure, the man of dreams, the anti-establishment utopian who promises greatness once again. On the right, such leaders usually promise to purge the infidels too, not just the elitists and annoying critics, who think they are better than us, but unpopular minorities who are not like us. Religion plays a role here too. In his study of American democracy in the 19th century, Alexis de Tocqueville observed that political freedom could only work in tandem with Christian morality. But only as long as organised faith was kept separate from political authority. This arrangement has worked for quite a long time. Organised religion provided an institutional source of solace, belonging, and hope, even \u2013 or especially \u2013 for the least privileged members of society. But this is now diminished. Hence, perhaps, the dangerous tendency to project the needs once catered to by religious faith on to secular leaders. Religion still plays a more important part in most American lives than is common in Europe, to be sure. A US president still has to pretend to care about religion, even if he doesn\u2019t really give a damn. And yet, even there, the rage against the elites, as arrogant, corrupt, and soulless (a common image of Hilary Clinton), has gathered such force than even religious people seek a kind of salvation in ecstatic mass rallies worshipping a shady business tycoon who has married three times, and \u201cgrabs pussy\u201d. He may be a sinner, but he promises glorious things that no technocrat can offer. That so many people have fallen for it shows how deeply we have sunk.

He said the One Nation leader Pauline Hanson\u2019s public criticism of him had been accompanied by demands for his resignation and control over his diary and office by Hanson and her chief of staff, James Ashby. Hanson told Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise that Culleton had failed to attend party room meetings and was quitting because One Nation refused to pay his legal bills in the high court and bankruptcy proceedings. \u201cRod Culleton is a pain in my backside.

In the statement, Culleton said policy decisions had been \u201crun in morning media, with no consultation, discussion or agreement from the party room\u201d. \u201cPersonal attacks and undermining, un-Australian behaviour towards myself and my team, [have] been ongoing and terms dictated to the team.\u201d Culleton did not regularly attend One Nation party-room meetings, citing other business and preparation for his high court case, and at times was unaware of policy changes including the party\u2019s willingness to accept a backpacker tax of 15%. He said the backpacker tax was a \u201ccase in point\u201d of lack of consultation because the 15% compromise, first reported by Guardian Australia, was \u201cdictated\u201d to him despite his clear intent to match New Zealand\u2019s level of 10.5%. Hanson said it was \u201ccompletely incorrect\u201d that there had been no consultation on policy. Describing the party\u2019s daily meetings, she said staffers and parliamentarians discussed upcoming legislation and \u201cwe are briefed on which way we\u2019re going to go on that legislation\u201d. Culleton said he had been \u201cconsistently committed\u201d to One Nation policies, including supporting the Australian bid for Kidman station. Hanson backed the successful Gina Rinehart Shanghai CRED joint venture. \u201cI can no longer tolerate the lack of party support for my positive initiatives, including the recent abandonment of One Nation\u2019s pre-election commitment to a banking royal commission,\u201d he said. Hanson announced she had negotiated with the government for a Senate inquiry to include banks\u2019 repossession of agricultural land due to loan defaults, a key plank of Culleton\u2019s mooted royal commission. She said she had negotiated the inquiry to help farmers now and \u201cfurther down the track\u201d would get a full royal commission. She accused Culleton of \u201cbullying the prime minister\u201d by being \u201cdemanding\u201d and \u201cover the top\u201d in a meeting about the banking sector.

Pauline Hanson says she can\u2019t work with One Nation\u2019s Rod Culleton    The senator, who had been convicted of larceny in his absence at the time of the election but the conviction was later annulled, said One Nation had approved the referral \u201cwithout evidence\u201d. He said when Hanson recruited him, she promised One Nation would be different to the major parties, and allow its members to vote on conscience. \u201cOne Nation promised to be different but in practice has failed to deliver on this and many other fronts.\u201d Culleton said he remained committed to represent his constituents to the best of his ability, and would deliver the \u201cbest outcome for Australians\u201d. \u201cIn supporting One Nation policy, I would have thought it reasonable to expect some measure of support or at the very least, some discretion and respect from the party leader and my party colleagues \u2013 there has been none,\u201d he concluded.

On Monday he told Guardian Australia Hanson had \u201cthrown Culleton under a speeding locomotive\u201d. \u201cHe is very valuable to us,\u201d Katter said. \u201cIn the cause of fighting the banks, to have someone in the Senate who will move resolutions to get a royal commission, is extremely important to us.\u201d He confirmed he had held discussions about whether Culleton should join his party but said his only consideration was whether it would help Culleton\u2019s survival \u2013 and he had concluded it would not. Instead, Katter said, he had spent \u201ca bloody long time trying to rescue the bloke\u201d in the past month. He attended both Culleton\u2019s high court hearings, offering moral support and even comparing him to Jesus in a handwritten note to his wife, Ioanna. \u201cWe would regard it as great honour to have Rod [Culleton] join, he\u2019s been a great fighter against the banks,\u201d he said.    Related: Rod Culleton and the associates who claim 50 years of Australian laws are invalid    Katter said Culleton had been \u201con the side of the angels\u201d in the four great battles of the 45th parliament. These were opposing the government\u2019s agenda to \u201cbash up the workers\u201d with its two industrial relations bills, lobbying for a lower backpacker tax, calling for a bank royal commission and supporting the Australian bid for Kidman and Co. He said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand\u201d Hanson\u2019s positions on those issues. \u201cIf One Nation stood for anything, I would\u2019ve thought it would be the Australian way.\u201d Hanson told reporters in Brisbane on Monday that she was aware that if the high court found Culleton ineligible for the Senate, it was his brother-in-law, Peter Georgiou, who was in line to take the seat as One Nation\u2019s second candidate. But Hanson said she was also \u201chearing rumours\u201d that Culleton\u2019s brother-in-law \u201cmay be a guarantor for him\u201d in bankruptcy proceedings heard in the federal court in Perth on Monday. \u201cSo if that be the case, his brother [sic] may not be eligible to stand. So if that be the case, the seat will then come back to the party to determine who goes into the seat,\u201d she said. Hanson said she was eyeing a \u201cloyal\u201d candidate who had been involved with the party more than 25 years, but did not name the person.           \u2018A pain in my backside\u2019: Pauline Hanson on Rod Culleton\u2019s resignation    Katter said Hanson wanted to \u201ckeep her puppies on a leash\u201d and had pushed Culleton out of the party because he had said she was doing \u201cthe opposite\u201d of what the party believed in with respect to \u201cthe ownership of Australia\u201d. Other parties were circling Culleton\u2019s Senate position \u201clike carrion\u201d, Katter said, raising the prospect one of the major parties could take the seat in a recount if the high court found he had been ineligible to stand. On Monday Hanson complained that she had no say over Culleton\u2019s replacement. She has previously said if Georgiou was elected the party would be on \u201cthe same merry-go-round\u201d.", "tags": ["Rodney Culleton", "Bob Katter", "One Nation ", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "Pauline Hanson"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-19T01:03:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/18/andy-murray-wins-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-2016", "sentences": ["Instead he raced around the world, racking up a series of titles in Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna and Paris before, finally, beating Novak Djokovic in the ATP Tour final to take his No 1 crown."], "title": "Andy Murray wins BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2016 award", "article": "Andy Murray capped a glorious year, in which he lifted the Wimbledon title, stormed to Olympic gold and became the first British tennis player to reach No 1 in the world, by winning Sports Personality of the Year for a record third time. Murray, a massive 1-7 on favourite with bookmakers beforehand, beat the gold medal-winning triathlete Alistair Brownlee into second place, with 58-year-old showjumper Nick Skelton, who became the oldest British gold medallist since 1908 in Rio, in third. Speaking from his training camp in Miami after being presented with his award by former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, Murray paid special tribute to his wife, Kim, and daughter, Sophia Olivia, but added: \u201cI\u2019ve got a bone to pick with my wife, who told me an hour ago she had voted for Nick Skelton! It\u2019s not smart of her with Christmas coming up. But I appreciate everyone\u2019s support. It\u2019s been an amazing year for British sport and I\u2019m proud to have played a part in it.\u201d Skelton said he was grateful for the support of Murray\u2019s wife but added: \u201cShe didn\u2019t vote enough!\u201d Murray, who won nine titles and reached the final of 13 of the 17 tournaments he entered in 2016, described it \u201cas the best year of my career and a great year for British tennis\u201d. He added: \u201cJo Konta finished in the top 10, my brother was No 1 in the doubles and Gordon Reid and Andy Lapthorne did well in the Paralympics, so I\u2019m proud to be a part of that.\u201d Murray, who became a father for the first time this year, said his parenthood had been a big influence on his success. \u201cI\u2019ve loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a challenge at the start but it made me realise there was more to life than just my sport. It\u2019s obviously helped my performances on the court.\u201d He also revealed that top half of the trophy was broken \u2013 and he had been worried about it falling apart on TV. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me how it got broken, but I was told that if I won I had to hold it close to my body so it didn\u2019t fall over on the camera,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the problems that Lennox and I the last time we did this [when there was botched handover in 2012, when he came third], I listened to them.\u201d It would have been entirely understandable if Murray had eased up after winning the Wimbledon final in July and Olympic gold a month later. Instead he raced around the world, racking up a series of titles in Beijing, Shanghai, Vienna and Paris before, finally, beating Novak Djokovic in the ATP Tour final to take his No 1 crown. But Murray warned it would be tough to remain on top in 2017. \u201cI\u2019m going to give it my best shot but it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d he added. Sports Personality was once regarded as mildly diverting pre-Christmas froth but this year it was bigger than ever, with a record 16-strong shortlist and a running time of more than two hours. There were also 12,000 paying spectators at the Genting Arena \u2013 at one point the queue to get in snaked all the way back to Birmingham International train station. Such was the strength of the shortlist, which included 13 Olympic and Paralympic gold medallists, that the triple Tour de France winner Chris Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins, whose exploits in Rio made him the most decorated British athlete in Olympic history, missed out. The heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua also failed to make the grade, as did Alastair Cook, who became the first Englishman to hit 10,000 Test runs. Murray got 247,419 votes \u2013 more than double that of Brownlee, who won 121,665 votes, and Skelton who had 109,197. Mo Farah, who won Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m gold, was fourth with 54,476 votes. Meanwhile, the other big winners on the night were Leicester City, who were rewarded for their stunning Premier League title victory with two awards \u2013 team of the year and coach of the year for Claudio Ranieri.

All the votes were added together to give a raw score. \u2022 To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score. \u2022 A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify for the list. \u2022 If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. \u2022 The individual voting breakdown will be published when the full list has been revealed. Voting disclosure \u2022 We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating in this project. \u2022 To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records will be anonymised in the full breakdown of scores. \u2022 Voters are identified only by their category and a number chosen at random.

It\u2019s hard not to be cynical when efforts to engage Chinese audiences usually seem to involve such screenwriting masterstrokes as getting your giant robots to lay waste to Shanghai instead of San Francisco, or some lantern-jawed action hero displaying an unlikely taste for hanzi-labelled soy milk. The world of cinema is supposedly bracing itself for complete realignment, but you could be forgiven for thinking the only people benefiting at the moment are washed-up American directors on the funding trail and Chinese stars you\u2019ve never heard of looking to raise their global profile. But it\u2019s time to look closer \u2013 billions of dollars and soft-power pre-eminence are on the table. Here are 10 parties with big stakes in Hollywood\u2019s drive eastwards: 1. Wang Jianlin   Related: Wang Jianlin: does China's richest man have a plan to take over Hollywood?    Hollywood\u2019s involvement in China is not a one-way street. Looking for finance doesn\u2019t just mean via box office \u2013 especially with China\u2019s top media players keen to invest directly in the American industry. At the front of the queue is Wang Jianlin, Asia\u2019s richest man and chairman of the Dalian Wanda conglomerate, which now owns AMC (second largest cinema chain in the US), Legendary Entertainment (producers of The Dark Knight and Jurassic World) and Dick Clark Productions (responsible for the Golden Globes). Some believe his conflicting interests in film production and exhibition might put him in breach of the 1948 antitrust ruling that broke up the studios\u2019 monopoly.  With Wang only one of a number of big-walleted Asian investors bankrolling Hollywood, 16 US congressmen recently called for an inquiry into growing Chinese influence. But with the US industry looking to learn Chinese, how can they not expect the opposite to also be true? 2. Struggling franchises  Warcraft \u2013 which took $47m (\u00a338m) in the US and $221m in China \u2013 is the latest, greatest example of a teetering piece of IP that came good thanks to a last-gasp top-up from the eastern hemisphere. Pacific Rim (US: $101m/China: $111m) and Terminator: Genisys (US: $89m/China: $113m) also shored up disappointing American showings this way (possibly because sci-fi is still a novelty for Chinese audiences). But this dubious insurance policy is likely to expire soon. Hollywood\u2019s dirty secret in the noughties, after DVD sales declined, was dumping substandard product on overseas territories and aggregating the numbers to break even. With Chinese filmgoers increasingly expecting quality, they\u2019re likely to be one of the first markets to rebel. 3. Zhang Yimou   Related: The Great Wall review \u2013 Matt Damon epic delivers spectacle but not soul    With other Chinese directorial names such as Feng Xiaogang and Stephen Chow struggling to have impact outside their country, Zhang is the one best placed to benefit from the Hollywood presence. Originally part of the iconoclastic \u201cFifth Generation\u201d, he is now firmly an establishment figure and already has international clout thanks to Hero and House of Flying Daggers. His 2011 film Flowers of War, an account of the Nanjing massacre starring Christian Bale, was one of the first big-scale US-Chinese co-productions \u2013 but was a dud in the west. His $160m The Great Wall, released recently in China and due for release in the UK and US in spring 2017, will be looking to finally perform the great crossover trick so fervently sought by Hollywood: a blockbuster with integral Chinese elements that doesn\u2019t alienate the rest of the world. Hence the contentious (in the west) casting of Matt Damon in the lead, opposite a raft of Asian stars (Hong Kong favourite Andy Lau; boyband fodder Eddie Peng and Lu Han; the up-and-coming star Jian Tian \u2013 who is also lining up for Kong: Skull Island and the Pacific Rim sequel). 4. Marvel     Tilda Swinton in Hong Kong to promote Doctor Strange. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images    The Middle Kingdom has been an integral part of Marvel\u2019s dazzling success over the last decades \u2013 hence why Doctor Strange chose not to utter the T-word. Before The Avengers in 2012, the company\u2019s Chinese grosses were negligible, with little or no culture of superhero films there. Since then, every Marvel release apart from the second Thor film has made at least 10% of its final box office in China. With its cross-fertilising cinematic universe able to spark interest in even marginal first-time properties such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, the company has conducted a masterclass in creating and nurturing brand recognition in an ostensibly arid cultural climate; far more so than fellow Disney stablemate Pixar, which has struggled there. So China will continue to be an integral part of its strategy \u2013 even if it means that T now stands for Tilda, not Tibet. 5. China Film Group China might be the new box-office Klondike, but that doesn\u2019t mean Hollywood is walking away with all the nuggets. Only 34 foreign films are allowed into the country each year under the quota system \u2013 and the studios receive only 25% of the profits under a revenue-sharing scheme (around half of their takeaway elsewhere). China Film Group, the state-film behemoth, is the only sanctioned film importer and takes about 22% of the proceeds for the pleasure.  So what\u2019s good for Hollywood is good for the local coffers. Especially in 2016: the mostly poor performance of local films has seen box-office projections flag well behind the $7.5-9bn range projected at the start of the year. Meaning China Film Group has sneakily extended this year\u2019s quota to 38; a permanent expansion is expected in 2017. 6. Donald Tang When two culturally far-flung entities such as Hollywood and China sound each other out, it\u2019s the hour of the intermediary. Beijing-based media agency DMG made a name early as \u201cgatekeeper\u201d to culturally tone-deaf LA newbies, and had a hand in Iron Man 3, Looper, Transcendence and the Point Break remake. But investment banker Donald Tang is shaping up as perhaps the most significant broker between worlds. The Shanghai-born former head of Bear Stearns Asia is now based in California; he helped shape Dalian Wanda\u2019s AMC coup, secure Chinese financing for hyped startup STX and has connections to most of the big Chinese moguls. Now, with his company recently acquiring the mini-studio IM Global (responsible for Martin Scorsese\u2019s forthcoming Silence), he\u2019s getting his hands dirty. Proof, in this cross-border world, of how a flap of a banker\u2019s chequebook in Beijing can start the cameras rolling elsewhere. 7. Scarlett Johansson           Ghost in the Shell: trailer for Scarlett Johansson anime adaptation    Chinoiserie was a popular style of western 18th-century decoration in which ceramics, interior design and gardens were given an oriental veneer. It\u2019s still working for the 21st-century blockbuster industry as a quick-fix means of appealing to both east and west: Pacific Rim appropriated Japanese kaiju destruction, and Big Hero 6 took place in the fusion city of San Fransokyo. Both were big hits in China. After scoring decently there with 2014\u2019s Lucy, set in Taipei, Scarlett Johansson is fully embracing multiplex chinoiserie by putting a Caucasian face on an iconic Japanese character: the cyborg The Major in the live-action version of Ghost in the Shell. The cries of yellowface will only be worth it if the film gets a Chinese release, and a chance at cementing Johansson\u2019s stardom on that epic playing field. 8. Fan Bingbing China\u2019s biggest female box-office draw, and the \u201cflower vase\u201d (as locals dub stars opportunistically cameoing in Hollywood films) currently most likely to break through. When Tony Stark turned to Chinese medicine to get his chest shrapnel removed in Iron Man 3, she was the wonky-eyed beauty in the operating theatre; she also had a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it part in X-Men: Days of Future Past (literally \u2013 she played the mutant Blink). Her English still isn\u2019t fluent enough to fully leap the language barrier that has hindered most Asian actors, but she has more momentum than the old generation of bilingual Hong Kong stars and peers such as Zhang Ziyi who may have already spent their Hollywood currency. Getting sandwiched between Jackie Chan and Johnny Knoxville in this summer\u2019s Skiptrace, one of the few big local hits of the year, will only have enhanced her crossover credentials. 9. Qingdao Movie Metropolis     Matt Damon promoting The Great Wall. Photograph: VCG/VCG via Getty Images    Another way in which China is trying to out-Hollywood Hollywood is by establishing itself as a production base to entice the \u201crunaway productions\u201d that have spurned Los Angeles over the past 30 years. Recently fanfaring a massive 40% tax rebate for foreign productions, this Wanda-owned complex will be the world\u2019s biggest studios when it opens in 2018. The Great Wall filmed scenes on the existing facilities, and Legendary\u2019s forthcoming Godzilla and Pacific Rim sequels will line up there, too. But they\u2019ll need to pack in more than in-house productions to give Qingdao that international lustre to match LA, Mumbai or even, hundreds of miles to the south, the fading glories of Hong Kong. Which means pulling in Hollywood blockbusters. 10. Cao Cao   Related: 'No ghosts. No gay love stories. No nudity': tales of film-making in China    As Hollywood tries to pack China with its wares, one man has made the most of a highly specialised niche that remains outside its sphere of influence. Jonathan Kos-Read, 43, is the go-to guy for the token foreigner role in domestic Chinese films. With more than 100 appearances since the late 90s, Cao Cao \u2013 as locals know him \u2013 is the most recognisable white actor working in the country. Totally unknown in the west but handsomely capitalising on a parallel cinematic dimension that exists in Hollywood\u2019s shadow, you won\u2019t know him for such iconic parts as corrupt British copper in Ip Man 3 and zombie lawyer in last year\u2019s No 3 Chinese film Mojin: The Lost Legend.

With Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the spin-off tale of the mission to steal the plans for the Death Star, taking almost $300m (\u00a3323m) globally on its opening weekend, Disney has easily shot past the previous $6.9bn annual ticket sales record set by rival Universal last year with hits including Jurassic World and Furious 7. With almost two weeks of the year left, the momentum generated by the most famous sci-fi franchise in the world and the popularity of the studio\u2019s animated film Moana ($282m and counting) is likely to push Disney\u2019s overall takings closer to $8bn. Disney has already released the four top-grossing films of the year so far with Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory and Zootopia taking more than $1bn at the global box office, while a live-action version of The Jungle Book fell just short. Doctor Strange, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, released in November, has made more than $650m to date.     Finding Dory grossed more than $1bn at the box office in 2016. Photograph: Disney/Rex/Shutterstock    The record haul is the crowning achievement of a decade long strategy to reinvigorate Disney\u2019s film division by buying up blockbuster franchises, characters and talent. In 2006, Disney spent $7.4bn buying Apple founder Steve Jobs\u2019 Pixar, the hit factory behind Finding Nemo, its sequel Finding Dory, Toy Story and The Incredibles, to help revive its once proud tradition of producing hit animated films. This was followed in 2009 by the surprise $4bn purchase of Marvel Comics\u2019 superhero universe, bringing in characters including X-Men, Iron Man and Captain America, which took Disney into new live action territory. The third transformational deal was snapping up George Lucas\u2019 Lucasfilm, maker of Star Wars and the Indiana Jones franchises, in a $4bn deal in 2012, with a plan to vastly expand the sci-fi franchise starting with 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens. The $15bn of deals, which were in each case criticised by City investors as overpriced, were the brainchild of Bob Iger, Walt Disney chief executive. \u201cIt was almost standard practice to say five and 10 years ago that Disney overpaid, but you see from the performance of the films from those divisions that they were essential to the company\u2019s success,\u201d says Guy Bisson, research director at Ampere Analysis.  When Iger took the helm in 2005 Disney was still licking its wounds, having fought off a hostile takeover attempt by cable TV company Comcast, which went on to take a stake in studio MGM and buy NBC Universal and DreamWorks. Its animation-led film operation was struggling. That year the company managed to get just one film in the global top 10, The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. And its studio was ranked fourth among the top five in the world\u2019s biggest market, the US. Fastforward to 2016 and Disney accounts for five of the top 10 grossing films this year. Star Wars: The Force Awakens has been Disney\u2019s single biggest hit, raking in $2.07bn, spread across two calendar years of box office takings as it launched in December 2015. Rogue One looks set to also break $1bn but will also see its box office take split across two calendar years. \u201cManagement had a vision that proved to be correct,\u201d says Bisson. \u201cThey focused on strong characters that work across all their business lines \u2013 toys, merchandising and theme parks; and it has been very advantageous that the franchises breathe sequels and spin-offs very naturally, and they are also very popular among the key audiences of millennials and the younger generation.\u201d     Artist\u2019s impression of the new Disney theme park Star Wars Land. Photograph: Disney/Lucasfilm    Disney is currently constructing a Star Wars Land at its flagship US theme parks, which will include a ride where visitors take control of the Millennium Falcon, and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which spawned the Johnny Depp mega-franchise, has recently been expanded to its Shanghai Disneyland. Another Disney blockbuster, Frozen, is reportedly the biggest merchandise moneyspinner of all time, with sales of more than $107bn. Hollywood\u2019s movie secret, which Disney happens to have mastered the best, at least for now, is that bigger is better and less is more. In 2005, the top five studios released 173 films, with Disney launching 31, according to Box Office Mojo. In 2016 that number has dropped to 118, with Disney down 60% with just 13. \u201cSince the financial crash studios had to rework the way they did things and cut their slates back,\u201d says David Hancock, director, head of film and cinema, at IHS Markit. \u201cVery few, very big films drive the box office upwards.\u201d The question is whether, or how long, Disney can keep its box office crown. The studio will get a running start with about two-thirds of Rogue One\u2019s global ticket sales counting toward\u2019s next year\u2019s tally.  And with a big titles including the second Guardians of the Galaxy movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Thor: Ragnarok, Disney is banking on another sequel-tastic year of blockbusters.     Disney will release a sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy in 2017. Photograph: AP    The 65-year old Iger, whose contract at Disney runs until 2018, will also be looking to the force for box office gold next year. Disney will be banking on once again trouncing rivals with the hope that Star Wars: Episode VIII will join just Avatar, Titanic and The Force Awakens in the exclusive $2bn-plus box office club.  \u201cThe next film in the Star Wars saga has the potential to claim the title as the biggest movie of all time,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a film analyst with comScore.

Oscar\u2019s club-record sale to the Chinese Super League side should be confirmed before the transfer window opens and, while Chelsea always anticipated being active in the market, the money will be ploughed back into the side. Antonio Conte has seen his team move six points clear at the top of the Premier League but will hope to add at least two players to bolster his options and maintain momentum.   Related: Oscar will get to count Chinese cash but he will pay a heavy price | Daniel Taylor    The manager accompanied the Chelsea technical director, Michael Emenalo, to France this month to watch Monaco\u2019s Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko and Djibril Sidib\u00e9 in the Champions League against Tottenham Hotspur. Prising either player away in January may be difficult given the Ligue 1 club are involved in the Champions League \u2013 they play Manchester City in the knockout stage \u2013 but both are aware of the interest. Fenerbahce\u2019s Simon Kjaer and the Roma pair Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Radja Nainggolan have been heavily scouted. Another player of interest to Chelsea, Leonardo Bonucci, has signed a contract extension at Juventus. Chelsea have won 11 Premier League games in a row, equalling the club record, but Conte has spoken regularly with Emenalo and the hierarchy about their strategy in the transfer window. \u201cWe must be very pleased with the side and with the achievement we\u2019ve reached now, and I\u2019m happy to play with these players,\u201d said Conte after Saturday\u2019s 1-0 win at Crystal Palace. \u201cBut it\u2019s logical that I have to speak with my club, to try to find the solution and make sure we arrive in a good position at the end of the season. I don\u2019t know what will happen in January, but it\u2019s important to talk to the club. We have a fantastic relationship and I have my ideas.\u201d Talks with Costa\u2019s representatives are to take place in the new year aimed at tying the 28-year-old to a deal worth \u00a3200,000 a week. The striker\u2019s contract expires in 2019 but there is a desire to extend the stay of a player who has scored 13 times in the league this season. Costa has cut an unsettled figure at times since moving to Stamford Bridge from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2014 but is as settled now as he has ever been. He is in Brazil on holiday having accrued a fifth yellow card of the season at Selhurst Park \u2013 his first caution in 11 matches \u2013 and, whereas the rest of the squad returned to training on Wednesday having had three days off, the forward has been granted an extra 24 hours away given he cannot play again until Stoke City visit Stamford Bridge on New Year\u2019s Eve. The Belgium forward Michy Batshuayi is expected to start in the Premier League for the first time against Bournemouth on Boxing Day, deputising for Costa. Eden Hazard has had treatment on the knee injury sustained against West Bromwich Albion but, having impressed at Palace, should be fit enough to start on Monday. The Football Association has confirmed Chelsea\u2019s first-team assistant first-team coach, Steve Holland, will join Gareth Southgate\u2019s coaching staff on a permanent basis at the end of the season. The 46-year-old has worked with Southgate since 2013, initially with the national set-up\u2019s Under-21s and, more latterly, with the seniors during October and November. He will continue to combine his duties with those at Chelsea for the remainder of the season before joining the FA on a full-time basis. \u201cI am delighted to have Steve as my assistant manager,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cWe have worked very closely for three years and I have upmost respect for the way that he works, his professionalism and the detail of his preparation. Our aim at the start was to encourage a young England team to play in a certain style and to develop a winning mentality; I think we certainly got a long way down the road to doing that with the under-21s. The challenge with the seniors is a greater one but Steve\u2019s experience of working with elite players and coaches at Chelsea means he knows what a world-class team needs to look like. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank Chelsea for allowing Steve to join up with us over the last three years. It\u2019s great that Steve is able to work with us on the March camp [for the World Cup qualifier against Lithuania and friendly in Germany] but getting him on a full-time basis is very important and I was more than prepared to wait until May for that to happen. If we want to be successful then we have to employ the best people and for me, Steve is the best.\u201d Martyn Margetson, who had joined the national team as Sam Allardyce\u2019s goalkeeping coach, will retain that role under Southgate, combining his duties with those at Cardiff City.", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Diego Costa", "Antonio Conte", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-21T22:30:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/dec/22/cities-instagram-best-shots-2016-from-seoul-sao-paulo", "sentences": ["#guardiancities A photo posted by GuardianCities (@guardiancities) on Feb 21, 2016 at 8:10am PST    Shanghai, China       @panvelvet lives in #Shanghai, where he likes to capture images both on the ground and above the city, particularly in the Bund area.", "&#34;I&#39;m really in love with Shanghai, I can\u2019t stop exploring new areas ..."], "title": "Cities on Instagram: the best shots of 2016 \u2013 from Seoul to S\u00e3o Paulo", "article": "The @guardiancities Instagram account curates the best urban photographers from around the globe, and this year we\u2019ve seen an amazing array of images from IGers who love to capture their city \u2013 including those who participated in our live weeks in Jakarta, Lagos and Canada.

Cutting through the heart of this booming city, where construction cranes are the most persistent feature of the skyline, is the Addis Ababa Light Rapid Transit (AALRT) network. It rears up suddenly at Meskel Square, which until 2013 gazed out onto an expanse of chaotic traffic. The traffic now bustles beneath the shadow of what is only the second metro ever built south of the Sahara. On the back of the green and white trains that trundle up and down the line are not one, but two logos: the Ethiopian Railways Corporation, and, next to it, the logo of the giant state-owned China Railway Group (CREC). How did China get involved in developing an African metropolis that westerners tend to associate with famine and death? And this is just one project among many across the continent. In 2014 alone, China signed more than \u00a356bn in construction contracts across Africa. Since the turn of the century, Chinese firms have built stadiums, highways, airports, schools, hospitals and, in Angola, an entire city that still stands empty. China has pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into African governments and infrastructure. In return, it has reaped hundreds of billions in commodities.    Related: Why does it still take so long to drive across Africa? | Tunde Kehinde    Few in Africa are certain that there is fair quid pro quo at play here. Is this the dawn of a new colonialism, they wonder, a new scramble for Africa in which the continent is once again left in tatters? Or is it the beginning of an era during which Africans shake off old colonial masters and look elsewhere for direct investment and aid?  The Light Railway goes some way to answering these questions. The project dates back to December 2011 when the idea for a 34.25km electrified light railway secured funds from Exim Bank of China. Construction for the 39-station project began in 2013 and the metro opened in September 2015, well ahead of schedule. The line has cost $475m, 85% of which was loaned by Chinese policy banks or enterprises. The project was a collaboration between CREC and the Ethiopian Railways Corporation, the junior partner, while the Shenzen Metro Group and CREC will serve as operations managers for the next five years until a planned handover to the local rail authorities.     Nova Cidade de Kilamba, a Chinese built city in Angola, acquired a reputation as a ghost town after it was largely unoccupied for several years. Photograph: Santa Martha    The metro moves about 15,000 people per line per day and costs about six birr (10p) a ride. But describing it as an outright success would be a stretch. The construction often looks slapdash \u2013 a standard complaint about Chinese construction projects across the continent. At St Estfanos station, an empty USAID wheat sack serves as a garbage bag. This serves as a neat analogy of the competing interests in Ethiopia, and also of the different approaches. For the West, the country has always been a basket case, or alternatively, a bulwark against Islamist extremism. For the Chinese, it represents a vast, untapped market: a country of almost 100 million people, 90 percent of whom are unbanked, primed to roar through the remainder of the century as a force in Africa, and beyond. The beginning of a \u2018win-win\u2019 relationship?  In 1971, during the Cultural Revolution, a young Chinese man called Gau \u201cVictor\u201d Hau had just finished a two-year stretch in an agricultural re-education camp. His first assignment from the Chinese Communist Party was in Tanzania as a translator on the most sizeable and important project ever undertaken by the Middle Kingdom on foreign soil. Now Gau is a career railway adviser for the massive state owned entity, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited (CRCC). But in 1971 his ability to speak English was crucial to a huge railway project planned between Tanzania and Zambia. In the late 1960s, Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had entered into an agreement with Tanzanian liberation hero Julius Nyerere and his Zambian contemporary Kenneth Kaunda. They would build a railway line from the Tanzanian port city of Dar es Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi, located in Zambia\u2019s copper belt. For Kuanda, the railway was an existential necessity: surrounded by white supremacist regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa, there was no way for him to export his primary resource to the sea. Hence, the Uhuru (Kiswahili for \u201cfreedom\u201d) Railway. For the CCP, the project was no less vital. Prior to rapprochement with the Nixon administration in 1972, and during Mao\u2019s lengthy enmity with the Soviet Union, China was subject to diplomatic purdah. To secure enough votes to become reinstated on the UN Security Council Beijing required allies, and hoped to find the necessary support in Africa. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara) line, to be paid for in full by the Chinese, was the beginning of what Beijing promised would be a \u201cwin-win relationship\u201d, a kinship based on mutual need to fend off shared antagonisms.     Tazara crossing bridge in Zambia. The line was paid for in full by the Chinese. Photograph: Richard Stupart    But there was a second, perhaps even more pragmatic, reason to build the railway. \u201cWe have to rely on importing natural resources from other countries,\u201d Gau said, seated behind a desk in his large Beijing office. \u201cIf China was to keep up sustainable development for many years, China has to secure a supply of natural resources and minerals to feed our industries.\u201d Tazara, with a $400m price tag, was blindingly expensive, especially for a country mired in poverty and still reeling from the chaos of Chairman Mao\u2019s revolutionary exertions. Gau says the railway\u2019s real cost was likely $1bn (at least $6bn in today\u2019s money), with a further $1bn in maintenance over the years. It was an immensely difficult engineering challenge. The track cut through 1,860km of bush and mountain ranges, with more than 300 bridges, 22 tunnels, 96 stations, and about 400,000 sq m of support structures. Almost 50,000 Chinese engineers, translators, project managers and labourers were contracted to the project, with a further 100,000 Zambian and Tanzanians filling out the workforce. All of this was funded by China with an interest free loan, to be paid back over 30 years, with a 10-year grace period.   Related: Four myths about slums: 'Don't assume people want to leave'    Although the project was completed two years ahead of schedule in October 1975, and jump-started a multilateral relationship between the People\u2019s Republic and dozens of African countries, neither Tanzania nor Zambia would pay anything close to their share \u2013 this was less a \u201cpartnership\u201d than a gift, Gau pointed out. And Tazara\u2019s success, like that of the AALRT, ended up as a mixed bag. According to Gau, China did not train enough local people to maintain the tracks and the equipment, and the railway now operates at a loss, beset by delays and inefficiencies. Indeed, the line is little more than a sop to industrial development: TAZARA\u2019s gauges don\u2019t even match up with that of Tanzanian Railways Limited, meaning that it exists in its own infrastructural universe.  But if the project wasn\u2019t a dazzling leap forward for east Africa\u2019s economy, it was brilliant geopolitics. \u201cAt that time China was mainly concerned with the political significance of the railway,\u201d says Gau. \u201cWithout Tazara, China would not be so easily rehabilitated with a UN seat.\u201d If Tazara represented the first and most significant attempt to forge a lasting south-south engagement, it remained for almost three decades an isolated and anomalous project, its lustre fading as soon as the inaugural trip had been undertaken. This was mainly a result of China deciding to double down on development at home \u2013 the recovery from the Cultural Revolution precluded any further costly adventures abroad. But as the 1970s melted into the 1980s, and gave way to a resurgent 1990s under Deng Xiaoping\u2019s mandate of \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d, when \u201csome would get rich first\u201d, the single greatest push for growth in the country demanded strong international partnerships if it were to succeed. In order to properly hit the diplomatic reset button, in October 2000 the Chinese hosted the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Four African heads of state made the trip to Beijing, at the invitation of the Chinese, who hoped to build an extensive and lasting multilateral partnership with the continent. By the time of the third FOCAC, six years later, 44 African leaders attended. Billions of dollars of development money was promised, and a new age had begun. Chinese priorities change: from politics to minerals Over the course of the commodities super-cycle, the boom market for natural resources such as oil, steel, gold, manganite and platinum, lasting roughly from the turn of the century to 2013, China and sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s economies were effectively coupled: when graphed, they mirrored each other. China purchased raw materials to fuel development at home, while massive state-owned organisations entered the African market, alongside Chinese-made goods and half a million Chinese migrants. Did this epochal encounter between 1.3 billion Chinese, and 1.1 billion Africans \u2013 nearly a third of the planet\u2019s population \u2013 maintain any of the coherent strands of \u201cwin-win\u201d friendship that ballasted the Tazara project? Was the relationship still guided from above by bureaucrats in Beijing\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs who knew exactly what they wanted, and could easily benchmark the outcomes? Not at all. Since Tazara, the Sino-African phenomenon has become much more sophisticated and highly fragmented and is no longer stage-managed by governments. Nowhere is this better shown than by a project announced in Johannesburg in 2013. That year, the South African press began reporting on a vast \u00a34.8bn real estate development in Modderfontein, north-east of the city, continually citing that fact that it would be financed and constructed by \u201cthe Chinese\u201d. The press was never clear on what was meant by \u201cthe Chinese\u201d. The details were surprising: the Modderfontein New City endeavour was headed by Zendai Group, a Hong Kong-listed company run by an eccentric, goateed entrepreneur named Dai Zhikang. Most of the group\u2019s more successful projects were undertaken in Shanghai. The plan was that the South African community, stretching over tens of thousands of hectares, would include \u201call the functions of a city, such as finance, trade, logistics, commerce, technology, education, health care and housing\u201d. Modderfontein New City, the company\u2019s website insisted, would become \u201cthe New York of Africa,\u201d with twisty postmodern skyscrapers and gigantic retail outlets, all operating on a green grid. Was this a nothing more than an old-school land grab, orchestrated by Beijing in a tidy neo-colonial manoeuvre? That was certainly the implication of the earliest news coverage. But on closer inspection, Modderfontein was just an ambitious real estate play that required big injections of private equity from South Africans. Zendai purchased an initial 1,600 hectares of land for about \u00a357m, and put another \u00a322m into infrastructure. The idea was to attract partnerships and other dealmakers, who would in turn attract others \u2013 a growth strategy based largely on the same real estate agent spin encountered anywhere in the world.   Related: Why aren\u2019t we designing cities that work for women, not just men?    Setting aside the big numbers, the big ideas and the big anxiety, there was nothing sinister about Modderfontein New City. Indeed, three years after the initial purchase Dai seems to have lost interest in real estate, and has dived into the Chinese art market. His South African arm, Zendai Development SA, is trucking along with the project. Whether the New City becomes a reality is anyone\u2019s guess. This is the way of things in these latter days of the Sino-African encounter. Without question, the Chinese are major players, engaged in hundreds of projects across a continent that desperately needs infrastructure and development. But not all of these projects are government-driven: some are worth only a few thousand pounds, and are negotiated between Africans and Chinese migrants in distant desert communities in remote Chad or Niger. Nonetheless, as American and British populists prepare to close their doors to the outside world, and as Western influence dims across the continent, China may well be the catalyst Africa has required to leap forward into the future. But with the pros come some serious, unanticipated cons.  Addis Ababa\u2019s light railway, while it hasn\u2019t quite made beaten up Lada taxis obsolete, has so thoroughly transformed the city that it counts as a work of urban alchemy. But the social cost may yet prove immense: as Addis expands and explodes, the city\u2019s borders push into land belonging to the Oromo people, causing social ruptures and violence. Ethiopia is facing its own muted version of the Arab Spring.  The fall of the regime in Ethiopia seems unlikely, but 2016 has taught us the limits of unlikelihood. Would a new government be as amenable to the Chinese, who were themselves so amenable to the previous oppressors? These questions abound in Africa, as certain regimes teeter, others tumble, and still others harden into lengthy runs at the helm. If the Chinese were once hoping for a comprehensive, mandated south-south axis, they have ended up with something more and less than that: an economic, cultural and social encounter that is changing the world, one railway line at a time.

The concern for Chelsea\u2019s manager Antonio Conte and Arsenal\u2019s Arsene Wenger is that there will now be an exodus of Premier League talent to Chinese clubs.  Observers of China\u2019s economy are worried about the transfer deal for a different reason. Buying up \u201ctrophy\u201d assets is the hallmark of a bubble economy and when the prices paid start to look silly it is a sign that the bubble is about to burst. Some might say that paying more than \u00a350m for a player who can\u2019t get a game in Chelsea\u2019s first team and offering him \u00a3400,000 a week in wages falls into the silly category. Dhaval Joshi, senior vice-president at BCA Research, said: \u201cOne defining feature of the last 40 years is a steady sequence of private sector credit booms which have inevitably turned to busts: notably, Japan in 1990, the Asian \u201ctigers\u201d in 1998, the US in 2007, and the UK, Spain and other European countries in 2008. \u201cIn this defining feature, China\u2019s is the last of the major credit booms that hasn\u2019t turned to bust \u2013 yet.\u201d The pricking of an asset-price bubble is always the last chapter of a story that starts promisingly. By the time Japan\u2019s property boom peaked, the value of the grounds of the imperial palace in Tokyo was allegedly greater than that of the whole of California. Yet the bubble was the culmination of a prolonged period of strong growth that saw Japan\u2019s economy rebuilt after the devastation caused by the second world war. Similarly, there was an explanation for the bidding up of technology stocks during the Dotcom bubble of the 1990s. There were real digital breakthroughs happening, but easy credit meant the boom got out of hand. China\u2019s economic transformation since the reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s has been remarkable. According to the World Bank, growth has averaged 10% a year and more than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Fortunes have been earned, with Deloitte noting that there are now more billionaires in Beijing (100) than in New York City (95). After three decades of rapid expansion, China\u2019s economy was showing signs of overheating when the financial crisis began in 2007. But its export-dominated economy was vulnerable to the collapse in trade and industrial production that followed the demise of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The government in Beijing, fearful that economic hardship would lead to political unrest, eased policy aggressively. Banks were flooded with cash and there was an extensive programme of public works. Not all the money was well spent. Roads were built that were not needed, ghost towns were constructed, factories that were unprofitable were kept open. And with fewer good bets to back in the real economy, investors awash with cash discovered the joys of asset speculation.  They have developed a penchant for western brands. In the UK Chinese investors have snapped up prestige names including Sunseeker motor yachts, Hamleys and House of Fraser store groups and the Odeon cinema chain. In recent days they have agreed to hand over \u00a397m for the loss-making Aquascutum label and earlier this month a Chinese government-backed investment group, Sinofortone, bought the Plough at Cadsden \u2013 the Buckinghamshire pub where David Cameron once shared a pint with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. Four Midlands football clubs are already owned by Chinese investors \u2013 West Brom, Wolves, Birmingham City and Aston Villa \u2013 while Sinofortone has been linked with a possible bid for Liverpool FC. By 2013, the limits of China\u2019s \u201cexpansion at any cost\u201d approach had been reached. Beijing started to restrict credit growth and the focus shifted towards the need for slower but better-balanced growth. But since then, policy has zigzagged as policy makers have tried to get the balance right. Laura Eaton, an economist at the consultancy Fathom, said that earlier this year the authorities \u201cthrew in the towel\u201d when the economy slowed by more than expected and reverted to stimulus. But the policy shift was relatively short-lived because Beijing is worried by the risks associated with another boom. Bank lending growth has peaked, the property market has slowed, and fiscal policy has become less supportive. Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics says this should result in economic growth slowing from around 6% in late 2016 to an average of nearer 5% in 2017 but he doesn\u2019t expect a \u201chard landing\u201d. Joshi\u2019s analysis suggests that Premier League managers should not worry too much about a mass exodus of their star players, pointing out that Beijing\u2019s balancing act cannot go on for ever.  \u201cAdmittedly, the ability of the Chinese authorities to \u2018extend and pretend\u2019 is probably greater than elsewhere in the world, and this might prevent another violent tipping point. \u201cIrrespective, the debt super cycle is over when the cost of malinvestment and misallocation of capital outweighs the benefit of good credit creation. With private sector indebtedness (including state owned enterprises) now at, or beyond, the level where every other credit boom peaked, China appears to be approaching this point.\u201d", "tags": ["China", "Global economy", "Chelsea", "Premier League", "Asia Pacific", "Business", "Economics", "Football", "Sport", "World news", "Chinese economy"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-23T14:58:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/25/chelsea-antonio-conte-michy-batshuayi-bournemouth", "sentences": ["If Michy is here, it\u2019s because he deserves to stay here.\u201d   Related: Chelsea agree \u00a352m fee with Shanghai SIPG for transfer of Oscar    Chelsea have made clear to West Ham United that any attempt to sign the player on loan will be swiftly rebuffed and they are keen to grant him game time in the Premier League in case they need to rely upon him more regularly over the second half of the season."], "title": "Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte may start Michy Batshuayi against Bournemouth", "article": "Antonio Conte has backed Michy Batshuayi to make his mark in the long term at Chelsea as he considers handing the Belgian his first Premier League start in place of the suspended Diego Costa for the Boxing Day visit of Bournemouth.

If Michy is here, it\u2019s because he deserves to stay here.\u201d   Related: Chelsea agree \u00a352m fee with Shanghai SIPG for transfer of Oscar    Chelsea have made clear to West Ham United that any attempt to sign the player on loan will be swiftly rebuffed and they are keen to grant him game time in the Premier League in case they need to rely upon him more regularly over the second half of the season. But Conte has been acutely aware of the toils endured by his compatriot Simone Zaza, a member of his Italy squad at Euro 2016, at West Ham this season and is anxious Batshuayi does not suffer the same teething problems. He is convinced the forward has improved merely by training alongside players such as Costa and Hazard. \u201cI think every single player, every forward, is different for characteristics, so Michy is different if you compare him to Diego,\u201d Conte said. \u201cAbove all because, first of all, he\u2019s a younger player. He can improve a lot. For sure, to stay close to Diego, you can learn a lot to improve your experience and improve your skills.

Companies from China ramped up their spending on overseas assets during the year, as a weakening domestic economy saw investors turn their attention overseas. A diverse array of targets included the maker of Godzilla, Aston Villa Football Club and the pub in which former prime minister David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping once shared a pint. The spending spree boosted non-financial overseas investment 55% in the first 11 months of 2016, putting Chinese companies on course to spend \u00a3130bn this year, compared with \u00a386bn in 2015, said commerce minister Gao Hucheng.   Related: Oscar's \u00a352m move to Shanghai is worrying for Chelsea FC \u2013\u00a0and China    While foreign investment has soared, the amount of money flowing into the country is set to remain broadly flat at \u00a392bn. This means the difference between investments abroad and those coming into China has reached an unprecedented \u00a339bn. The widening gap has triggered concerns about capital flight, where investors send their money out of the country rather than investing it to spur domestic growth. Gao signalled that Beijing would move to address the investment gap by reining in Chinese firms\u2019 overseas spending and making it easier for firms from abroad to access the Chinese economy. He said the government would \u201cpromote the healthy and orderly development of outbound investment and cooperation in 2017\u201d, in remarks at a conference that were published on the commerce ministry\u2019s website. In November it was reported that China was preparing a clampdown on non-Chinese mergers and acquisitions.  Separately, the ministry said on its blog that China would sharply reduce restrictions on foreign investment access in 2017 to make it easier for overseas firms to spend their cash in the People\u2019s Republic. No details were given on what restrictions would be changed. Major Chinese investors have spread their investment around the world and across multiple sectors during 2016. One of the most high-profile purchases was part of a multi-billion dollar bet on high-end US real estate by Chinese buyers. Insurer Anbang spent $6.5bn (\u00a35.3bn) on luxury group Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts from private equity group Blackstone, continuing a flood of Chinese money into prime US property. The deal came two years after the same firm paid Hilton Hotels $1.95bn for the Waldorf Astoria in New York, a landmark art deco building ranked among the world\u2019s most fabled hotels. British assets have also proved tempting for Chinese firms and wealthy businessmen looking to add to their already sizeable clutch of UK investments. State-backed China General Nuclear took a 30% stake in the \u00a324bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, helping France\u2019s government-owned energy group EDF fund the project. While Hinkley was the highest-profile Chinese foray into the UK, its investors have also showed they are partial to English football clubs, particularly those from the West Midlands. Entrepreneur Guochan Lai bought West Bromwich Albion for a sum thought to be between \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m earlier this year. Businessman Tony Xia spent \u00a376m to buy Aston Villa, even after the club had been relegated from the Premier League, vowing to restore the club to its former glory. Investment group Fosun International paid \u00a345m to gain control of Wolverhampton Wanderers.     Chinese businessman Tony Xia bought Aston Villa for \u00a376m earlier this year. Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC via Getty Images    Among the larger British acquisitions by Chinese firms in 2016 was the \u00a31.4bn that travel firm Ctrip.com paid for flight comparison website Skyscanner. The takeover was announced just a day after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised to stem the flow of British firms being sold to foreign investors before reaching their full potential. Government-backed SinoFortone sealed a much smaller but diplomatically significant deal when it bought a 16th-century Buckinghamshire pub for an undisclosed fee. The Plough at Cadsden, Buckinghamshire \u2013 a rural tavern near Chequers, the official country retreat used by British prime ministers \u2013 hosted former PM David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping during a diplomatic visit that saw them set the world to rights over a pint of Greene King IPA. Chinese investors were also involved in the consortium that agreed to pay \u00a313.8bn by a majority stake in the National Grid\u2019s gas pipeline network. This year\u2019s deals increase the scale of investment into the UK from China, which already owns or holds large stakes in household names such as Weetabix, Pizza Express and Thames Water. One huge deal that was agreed this year but may not complete until early 2017 is ChemChina\u2019s $43bn takeover of Swiss seeds and pesticides giant Syngenta. The deal would be China\u2019s largest ever foreign acquisition and is seen as a key plank of its strategy to ensure food security for its huge population. The bright lights of Hollywood have also attracted Chinese money. Investment group Wanda, headed by China\u2019s richest man Wang Jianlin, paid $3.5bn for the Legendary studio behind films including Godzilla and Pacific Rim. Elsewhere, copper-processing company Anhui Xinke New Materials proved a more unlikely investor in the silver screen.

In recent months an unmissable fleet of fluorescent orange, canary yellow and ocean blue bicycles has hit the streets of urban China as part of a hi-tech bike-sharing boom that entrepreneurs hope will make them rich while simultaneously transforming the country\u2019s traffic-clogged cities. \u201cWe want to solve problems by getting bikes back on to the streets of our cities,\u201d said Li Zekun, the 25-year-old marketing director of Ofo, one of the startups spearheading this 21st-century transport revolution. From Shanghai to Sichuan province, bike-sharing schemes are being rolled out on an unprecedented scale in an effort to slash congestion and air pollution by putting a country once known as the \u201cKingdom of Bicycles\u201d back on two wheels. Ofo, so named because of the word\u2019s resemblance to a bicycle, has put about 250,000 of its bright yellow bikes to work since late 2015, of which around 40,000-50,000 are in the capital, according to Li.      A Chinese woman rides one of Ofo\u2019s yellow bikes in Beijing. Photograph: Wu Hong/EPA    The Peking University biology graduate said his company, which was founded by five students looking to improve transport options on university campuses, had attracted about 3 million users in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Guangzhou. Its bicycles make about 1.5m trips each day between them. \u201cFor short journeys, bikes are the best form of transport,\u201d Li enthused at Ofo\u2019s headquarters in the Internet Finance Centre, a 26-floor building in western Beijing. \u201cYou never know when a bus might come. It might not be easy to find a taxi. Walking might take you too long and tire you out.\u201d Other startups, such as Mobike and Bluegogo, are seeking to get in on the act, depositing truckloads of bicycles on sidewalks and street corners across China.  Li Gang, Bluegogo\u2019s 28-year-old chief executive, said he believed bike sharing would bring \u201cmental joy\u201d to millions of Chinese citizens as well as boosting their health and fitness levels.  It was his mission \u201cto enable everyone to enjoy the happiness of bike riding\u201d, he said.  \u201cI predict that by next year millions of people will be riding bikes in Beijing every day,\u201d said the entrepreneur, whose firm has 50,000 bikes spread across three cities \u2013 Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shenzhen \u2013 and plans to expand to a new city every fortnight.  \u201cMore people will choose this healthy way to get around so the number of cars on the roads will decrease dramatically and this will really help the climate and the environment,\u201d he said.      Bluegogo bicycles in the company office in Shenzhen. Photograph: Reuters    In the years following Mao Zedong\u2019s 1949 communist takeover, bikes ruled supreme in China and the Flying Pigeon \u2013 the eastern equivalent of the Raleigh Roadster \u2013 became one of the country\u2019s most recognisable symbols.  But two-wheeled travel began to go out of fashion as China became more open to the world, ushering in decades of economic boom and a high demand for cars.  In 1980, almost 63% of commuters cycled to work, the Beijing Morning Post reported last year, citing government data. But by 2000 that number had plummeted to 38% and today it stands at less than 12%. Car use, meanwhile, has rocketed. In 2010 China overtook the US to become the world\u2019s largest car market, with 13.5m vehicles sold in just 12 months. This year, manufacturers expect to sell almost 23m passenger cars.  That jump from two to four wheels has been music to the ears of international car manufacturers, but it has resulted in gridlock and contributed to a pollution crisis experts blame for hundreds of thousands of premature deaths every year. According to state media, Beijing has 5.65m registered vehicles which annually pump 500,000 tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere. And with China now waging a high-profile \u201cwar on pollution\u201d, cities hope a return to the era of the bicycle can help them clean up at least some of the smog. Transport officials in Beijing are aiming to get 18% of commuters riding to work by 2020.  Public bike-sharing schemes, of which there are more than 500 around the world, have existed in China for about a decade but the scale on which these private initiatives are being rolled out is unprecedented.  Reports in the Chinese media suggest hundreds of thousands of shared bikes have been put into action. That compares with 11,500 operating in the British capital, according to Transport for London. The other factor making China\u2019s bike-sharing boom stand out is the technology. While those sharing bikes in cities such as London must pick them up and park them at docking stations, tracking technology means Chinese users can collect and park their bikes wherever they please.  Mobike\u2019s orange-wheeled bikes have a GPS system that allows users to locate them using a map on the company\u2019s smartphone app.      A rank of Mobikes in Beijing. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Users of Ofo\u2019s yellow bikes, which cost about 10p to use, unlock them using a combination code sent through its app, and the company keeps tabs on its bikes by monitoring the location of the users\u2019 smartphones.  \u201cIt is very convenient,\u201d said Li, who claims an Ofo bike can be ready to ride in about 10 seconds.  Chinese investors, including the tech giants Didi Chuxing and Tencent, are throwing their weight behind the bike-sharing startups, pumping tens of millions of pounds into their operations since the autumn.  A recent story about the budding industry in the China Daily warned of \u201cgrave maintenance and management challenges\u201d and the existence of unscrupulous users who damaged or disappeared with the bikes. Recent weeks have seen reports of stolen bicycles, which are worth up to 3,000 yuan (\u00a3350), being sold online.  But the China Daily urged commuters and city officials to embrace the attempt to \u201creinvigorate the nation\u2019s love affair with the bike\u201d.  Li said his company believed so strongly in a global cycling renaissance that it planned to export its bike-sharing revolution to London, Singapore and Los Angeles. \u201cIn the future, we hope people all over the world will be using Ofo\u2019s app to unlock its bikes, anywhere and at anytime,\u201d he said.

Bookshops have closed. Publishers have left. Authors have stopped writing. Books have been pulped. Printers are refusing political works. Translators have grown weary of being associated with certain topics. Readers have stopped buying. And the whole industry is wondering if hard-hitting books on Chinese politics still have a future in the former British colony.    Related: Hong Kong protesters march over abducted booksellers    The booksellers involved, formerly known only to a small niche of insiders, have now become household names in Hong Kong: Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen, remains jailed in an undisclosed location in China after he was kidnapped from his holiday home in Thailand. Lee Bo, a British national who was lifted off the streets of Hong Kong and taken to China against his will has been released and allowed to return, but has consistently refused to give a full account of what has happened to him. He remains in China. Lui Por and Cheung Chi-ping, two clerks at Causeway Bay Books, the bookshop at the centre of the case, disappeared while on a visit to Shenzhen. They are also formally free, but live across the border where they have refused to entertain calls from the press and former associates.  The booksellers were pressured into televised confessions broadcast on national TV, in which they admitted to a variety of crimes \u2013 from a hit-and-run incident to mailing to sending Chinese clients forbidden Hong Kong books without a licence.

Political sensitivities \u2026 President Xi Jinping of China. Photograph: Fred Dufour/EPA    Nobody knows exactly why the authorities in China decided to crack down on Causeway Bay Books, though it is thought that the final straw is likely to have been a salacious work about China\u2019s president Xi Jinping\u2019s relationship with women that was about to be published.  Bao Pu, co-founder of New Century Press (a publishing house that specialises in highbrow political books), says that controls at the border with Hong Kong have been getting stricter in the past few years \u2013 \u201cand ever more so since the establishment of the Southern Hill Project in 2010\u201d. This refers to the code name of a campaign launched by the Chinese authorities to counter the influence of the Hong Kong publishing industry, which was seen as growing exponentially.  As more Chinese visitors had been allowed to travel to Hong Kong withoutvisas, shopping for politically revealing books forbidden in the rest of the country had become widespread. Some had been dubbed \u201cdemocracy tourists\u201d by activists who\u2019d see them also taking part, or observing, pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong.  Until the Causeway Bay case, these books were easy to buy, allowing Chinese citizens to gain a glimpse \u2013 not always truthful \u2013 of the inner workings of their opaque leaders. At the airport, in 24-hour convenience shops and in regular bookstores, political books about the Communist party, the People\u2019s Liberation Army and individual leaders were readily available next to milk powder and traditional medicines, two of the other items particularly sought-after by Chinese tourists.  This is no longer the case. Since April, the 16 bookstores at the Hong Kong International Airport have been cut down to 10. The biggest five are now controlled by Chung Hwa Book Co, a company that was established in Shanghai in 1912 and is now under Sino United Publishing, a mainland-backed conglomerate that owns most Hong Kong bookshops \u2013 and where the \u201cforbidden\u201d books are mostly unavailable.  Critical, gossipy books have also disappeared from the ubiquitous 7-Eleven stores and other 24-hour mini-supermarkets. A clerk at a 7-Eleven outlet in Hollywood Road, a central street well-known to tourists for its antique shops, only says that this was a decision by the management, as the books were \u201cstill selling\u201d. She declines to give her name, and 7-Eleven, now owned by Dairy Farm, a pan-Asian retailer part of the Jardine Matheson Group, has not replied to a written request for an interview.     Tourism to Hong Kong by mainland Chinese citizens has grown dramatically \u2013 giving more people access to critical or salacious publications. Photograph: Dale de la Rey/AFP/Getty Images    Independent bookstores, on the other hand, have been deserted by their former customers, and some have had to close down. One of them is 1908 Books, a bookstore in the Tsim Sha Tsui district that stocked only political books and magazines. It shut its doors earlier this year without any public announcement. In November, Page One, a large Singapore-owned bilingual chain that occasionally carried political books in Chinese, withdrew from Hong Kong entirely.  A handful of independent bookstores do survive, but they all belong to the \u201csecond-floor bookshops\u201d category: operating from higher floors of commercial buildings and harder to find for visitors unfamiliar with Hong Kong. One example is People\u2019s Coffee and Books, also located in Causeway Bay, which doubles as a cafe. It is still carrying all the troublesome volumes, but owner Paul Tang says it is seeing far fewer customers than at this time last year. And in an unexpected twist, the Causeway Bay Books outlet \u2013 still closed to the public \u2013 was purchased by a Chinese national. One aim of the Southern Hill Project is to put pressure on tour guides: \u201cThe Tourism Bureau ensures that travellers bound for Hong Kong and Taiwan receive warnings and are subject to propaganda, and tour guides are given the responsibility to remind, discourage and prevent tourists from buying publications that are deemed politically harmful to bring back to China,\u201d says Bao.

Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP    The clampdown is not only affecting what bookstores can sell but the books that are now available to them, with fewer books being published in the first place. \u201cThe bookseller incident not only sets new boundaries but also reinforces the norm, which is to publish in journals instead of books,\u201d says Edmund Cheng, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.  \u201cThe former\u2019s audience is restricted to peers and students but matters a lot in academics\u2019 livelihoods and in the ranking of universities. But in this way, academic publication\u2019s usage in the public sphere is undermined. So authoritarian protocol and market logic work quite well together.\u201d  It has been a slow shift away from freer days, as Cheng underlines: \u201cThe self-censorship started before the booksellers\u2019 case: after the umbrella movement [the pro-democracy protests that began in September 2014], it was no longer easy to publish critical books written by academics,\u201d he says. \u201cTitles, in particular, can no longer carry certain words, like \u2018social movement\u2019. If you have those in your title, you are no longer invited to conferences, especially on the mainland.\u201d Timothy O\u2019Leary, head of the school of humanities at Hong Kong University, confirms this: \u201cThe effect is more likely to be a slow undermining of willingness to publish in politically sensitive areas,\u201d he says, as academics and writers alike shy away from potential trouble.

Mei Fong, author of One Child: The Story Of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment, a book about the one-child policy and its consequences published in English this year, tried unsuccessfully to have her book distributed in Chinese.  \u201cI wanted to reach the audience that has been most touched by the topic I analyse,\u201d she says. But \u201cafter trying unsuccessfully to have the book published in China, I looked for a Hong Kong publisher, which is how books on \u2018banned\u2019 topics used to reach readers in the mainland. I was told that the problem with the book was not so much the sensitivities, but the difficulty in finding a distributor. Yet even before that, my translator pulled out,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I commissioned my own translator, who asked to remain anonymous, but even then I could not find a publisher, neither in Hong Kong, because of the consequences of the five booksellers\u2019 disappearance, nor in Taiwan, where books about China are not very popular.\u201d She decided to attempt a new approach, allowing the Chinese version of her book to be be downloaded for free, with the possibility of contributing a voluntary fee to cover costs. It\u2019s not clear how long her experiment can last before the mainland censors pull the plug on her website.  \u201cEverybody is scared,\u201d says Renee Chiang, of New Century Press. \u201cThe printers \u2026 are not willing to print political books. And the bookshops are not willing to stock political books, because now it is considered dangerous. But since the majority of the readers of this kind of work are visitors from the mainland, now that the customs officers have increased their surveillance and confiscation of political books, they are no longer buying them. So at both ends of the chain we have problems.\u201d Given the climate in Hong Kong, printers do not see their refusal to print as a political decision, but purely a business one. AsiaOne, which used to print political books without worries, has ceased doing so \u2013 but nobody at the company agreed to be interviewed. Jason Chan, of printing company Sun-Design, says that \u201ctruly speaking, the booksellers\u2019 case has a bad influence on the publishers and the booksellers still working in Hong Kong. I still believe that Hong Kong is a safe place to work, so I haven\u2019t rejected any book\u2019s printing yet because of political reasons. Nowadays, the volume of books printed is going down, but the impact has been [great] only on specific bookstores and publishers,\u201d he says. Authors, too, are feeling the pinch. Yu Jie, a mainland author of politically sensitive books, saw his contract for a new book on Xi with the publishers of Open Magazine \u2013 a monthly that tries to follow the party\u2019s power struggles \u2013 rescinded after the chief editor, Jin Zhong, left Hong Kong under pressure from his family. The book was eventually published in Taiwan to a much smaller audience. Meanwhile, given the prohibitive costs of keeping unsold stock, some publishers have resorted to pulping political books that had no chance of getting distributed.  According to the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong\u2019s main English language paper, Sophie Choi \u2013 Lee Bo\u2019s wife \u2013 ordered \u201c45,000 books critical of the Communist party destroyed\u201d in the hope of facilitating her husband\u2019s release. Other publishers, too, have privately admitted to destroying political books that cannot be distributed and sold.  The damage done to the Hong Kong publishing industry is unprecedented. \u201cSince 1949, Hong Kong had always been the place where books about China could be published. Its role was huge, way beyond the size of Hong Kong and its readership. This is why to this day scholars from China and from all over the world come to Hong Kong: to be able to see sensitive material,\u201d says Bao. \u201cThis is now disappearing.\u201d", "tags": ["Publishing", "Hong Kong", "Booksellers", "China", "Culture", "Censorship", "Xi Jinping", "Freedom of speech", "Books", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Law"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-28T08:06:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/28/mark-carney-bank-england-governor-2016-year-quotes", "sentences": ["We\u2019re not out of ammunition In February at a G20 meeting in Shanghai, Carney argued that central banks still had some firepower left to prop up the global recovery, but he warned that politicians must not rely solely on low interest rates and should use government policy to help boost growth."], "title": "Mark Carney's year in quotes: 'We are actors in a play written by others'", "article": "When Canadian Mark Carney accepted the job of Bank of England governor in 2012, he said he was honoured to accept the \u201cimportant and demanding role\u201d. It is doubtful he could have foreseen, however, quite how demanding it would turn out to be.  As the man charged with maintaining calm in the financial markets and the economy, Carney had the most testing of years in 2016. The year started with wild swings in global markets. As the EU referendum campaign got under way, Carney\u2019s Brexit recession warning drew calls for his resignation from pro-leave supporters. The shock result sent the pound tumbling and sparked a political crisis. The Bank stepped in with an interest rate cut and more electronic money printing. There was a fresh onslaught from politicians in autumn as senior Tories lambasted the Bank over the effects of low interest rates, but after weeks of speculation over his future Carney agreed to stay on as governor for an extra year until the Brexit deadline is expected to expire in 2019. After Donald Trump won the US presidential race on an anti-globalisation ticket, Carney ended the year with a plea for politicians to do more to share out the gains from global trade.  Here is Carney\u2019s year in quotes:  A new year warning Carney started the year on a gloomy note by pouring cold water on market talk of a rate rise, saying UK growth was still too weak.  Amid turmoil in global markets in January, Carney said the UK faced \u201ca powerful set of forces\u201d.  \u201cThe world is weaker and UK growth has slowed,\u201d he added. \u201cThe year has turned and in my view the decision proved straightforward. Now is not yet the time to raise interest rates.\u201d His new stance marked something of a climbdown on his guidance in the summer of 2015 that a decision about raising rates would \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d at the end of the year. That did little to help shake off the tag of \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d given to the Bank governor by one MP. The kindness of strangers In one of many warnings to come about the potential consequences of a vote for Brexit, Carney said in January that concerns about a UK exit from the EU could test \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d \u2013 a reference to the global investors who fund the UK\u2019s big current account deficit with the rest of the world. \u201cThe global general environment has become much more febrile, much more volatile, and relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that kind of environment,\u201d Carney told MPs. We\u2019re not out of ammunition In February at a G20 meeting in Shanghai, Carney argued that central banks still had some firepower left to prop up the global recovery, but he warned that politicians must not rely solely on low interest rates and should use government policy to help boost growth. \u201cSeveral commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is \u2018out of ammunition\u2019 \u2026 This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,\u201d Carney said.  Carney defends Bank over Brexit warnings     Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg (right) asks Mark Carney and his deputy, Sir Jon Cunliffe, a question in the House of Commons in March. Photograph: PA    In March, Carney was forced to fend off accusations that Threadneedle Street was being too supportive of the government\u2019s pro-EU line and described as \u201centirely unfounded\u201d the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan. \u201cI am expressing the views of the Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t leant on by anybody.\u201d  Brexit could stall UK economy In April, Carney said Britain\u2019s economy could struggle to grow if the country voted to quit the EU, and warned that Britain\u2019s economy already appeared to be losing steam before the EU referendum. \u201cRisks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty,\u201d he told the Stockport Express newspaper. Carney drops the R-word At a press conference in May, Carney said a vote to leave the EU could possibly tip the UK into recession. \u201cMaterial slowdown in growth, notable increase in inflation. That\u2019s the MPC\u2019s judgement. It\u2019s a judgment not based on a whim, it\u2019s a judgment based on rigorous analysis and careful consideration.  \u201cThere\u2019s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.\u201d  Prepared for referendum fallout After the referendum result is confirmed, with share prices crashing and David Cameron announcing his intention to step down as prime minister, Carney insisted: \u201cWe are well prepared for this.\u201d He said: \u201cWe have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today\u2019s events. In the future, we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward.\u201d Economic post-traumatic stress disorder A week after the referendum, Carney said \u201csome monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer\u201d, signalling that a rate cut was coming. In a wide-ranging speech he also highlighted a cocktail of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainty. \u201cAll this uncertainty has contributed to a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets,\u201d he said.  \u201cToday, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people, despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced.\u201d  We were right to warn on Brexit In July, Carney faced questions from parliament\u2019s Treasury committee over whether the Bank had \u201cpeddled phoney forecasts\u201d about the risks of a Brexit vote.  The governor said accusations from critics that the Bank had been dishonest were \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cWe have an obligation to give these assessments. \u201cIf we view something as the biggest risk to financial stability, we have an obligation to parliament and to the people of the UK to make that clear.\u201d Time for an interest rate cut Cutting official interest rates to a record low of 0.25% and expanding the Bank\u2019s electronic money-printing programme to shore up the post-referendum economy, Carney said it was time for action.  \u201cThere is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to have an effect when the economy really needs it.\u201d Serene about our stance In September, with the economy continuing to show signs of resilience since the referendum, Carney rejected criticism that the central bank had overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy from the Brexit vote. He also defended the Bank\u2019s post-referendum stimulus package. \u201cI am absolutely serene about the \u2026 judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC,\u201d Carney told parliament\u2019s Treasury committee, referring to the Bank\u2019s monetary and financial policy committees.  Call me Carnage     The Bank of England governor admitted his childhood nicknames included \u2018Carnage\u2019 and \u2018Carnival\u2019. Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters    Fielding questions from schoolchildren in Coventry, Carney revealed he likes milk chocolate and dogs. Asked about childhood nicknames, he answered: \u201cI was given nicknames that were variants of my last name which is Carney, so I was called Carnival, or Carnage, or things like that. I like Carnage a little better than Carnival. It seemed a little more manly I guess.\u201d  We are actors in a play Carney made another call in September for politicians to stop relying on central banks to do all the heavy lifting on supporting economic growth. \u201cThe Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others. \u201cLong-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth, low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies.\u201d We won\u2019t take orders from politicians Just a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the Bank\u2019s actions on \u201cordinary\u201d people, Carney said: \u201cWe are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.\u201d  Politics won\u2019t scare me off     The Bank of England building on Threadneedle Street in the City of London. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian    After an onslaught on his performance by the Conservative party establishment, Carney insisted he would not be swayed by political issues as he weighed up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021.  \u201cIt is entirely personal, and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy, actual, imagined, potential, past, etc. This is a role that requires total attention, devotion, and I intend to give it for as long as I can.\u201d I\u2019ll see Brexit process through At the end of October, Carney ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England until 2019. \u201cBy taking my term in office beyond the expected period of the article 50 process, this should help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK\u2019s new relationship with Europe,\u201d he said. Consumers are shrugging off Brexit vote so far Keeping interest rates at their record low of 0.25% and warning of higher inflation ahead, Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee said individuals seemed to be resilient for now. \u201cFor households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year,\u201d he said. Central banks haven\u2019t raised inequality \u201cAn excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is a massive blame-deflection exercise. We can\u2019t make the structural decisions that change the path of productivity. Monetary policy doesn\u2019t drive fundamentals,\u201d Carney told MPs in November. Rest of Europe needs City of London In November, Carney warned that European economies could be damaged if their access to the City of London was disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. \u201cThe UK is effectively the investment banker for Europe.\u201d Globalisation is leaving many behind     President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Orlando, Florida. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP    Carney finished the year with a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a growing sense of \u201cisolation and detachment\u201d among people who felt left behind by globalisation. Speaking weeks after Trump won the US presidential race, Carney said: \u201cFrom the rising spectre of global terrorism to intensifying geopolitical tensions and financial crises, for too long, for too many people, the world seems to be getting riskier \u2026 We need to move towards more inclusive growth where everyone has a stake in globalisation.\u201d He also called for economists to be more honest about the price paid by some for technological advances. \u201cThe fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods \u2013 and therefore identities \u2013 well before new ones emerge.\u201d", "tags": ["Mark Carney", "Bank of England", "Business", "Economics", "Interest rates", "Sterling"], "publicationDate": "2016-12-28T11:29:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/28/franck-kessie-chelsea-bid-rejected", "sentences": ["Chelsea are keen to find a replacement for the Brazil international Oscar, who completed his move to Chinese Super league side Shanghai SIPG for \u00a352m this week."], "title": "Chelsea\u2019s \u00a321m offer for midfielder Franck Kessi\u00e9 rejected by Atalanta", "article": "Atalanta have rejected a \u20ac25m offer from Chelsea for Franck Kessi\u00e9, with the Ivorian midfielder\u2019s agent claiming there is also interest from several other Premier League sides including Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal.

In summary: with only a few days to go until January, the gossip is at least starting to get a little more intense and earnest, even if the actual transfers aren\u2019t quite at that point yet.  But let\u2019s start with a managerial move. The topic of who\u2019s going to be Swansea\u2019s next manager is a piping hot one, and thrown into the ring is a hat, a hat belonging to one Harry Redknapp. Yessir, the man last seen limping away from a doomed QPR because of a gammy knee, a knee mercifully now restored to full health, thinks Swansea could be just his sort of caper, and what\u2019s more he wants to take John Terry with him. Remarkable how Swansea have gone from being one of the most likeable clubs in the league to, well, not. Other, perhaps more realistic candidates for the gig are Chris Coleman, Gary Rowett and Ryan Giggs, with the latter apparently chairman Huw Jenkins\u2019s preferred choice.   Related: Carlos Tevez signs for Shanghai Shenhua in deal worth \u00a3615,000 a week    Patrice Evra, star of Instagram and occasional games of football, is heading back to England. An emotional return to Manchester United? Perhaps to link up with former Juventus boss Antonio Conte? Maybe a chance to heal old wounds with David Moyes? Nope, none of them: apparently West Ham is the place, with a lack of playing time in Italy meaning he will accept absolutely anything, even if that is running around a state-funded bowl in east London somewhere as those around him stumble around in assorted forms of shambles.  If you keep your ear to the ground, you\u2019ll surmise that Chelsea are looking for some help in midfield. Their \u00a321m bid for Atalanta midfielder Franck Kessi\u00e9 apparently wasn\u2019t quite what the Italian club was looking for, but don\u2019t worry: they\u2019ve got other plans. Specifically, Radja Nainggolan-shaped plans, with a \u00a351m \u2013 \u00a351m! \u2013 bid in the works for the Roma midfielder. And if that doesn\u2019t work, then they\u2019ve got their little hearts set on Bayern\u2019s Arturo Vidal, which does sound a little like ordering the burger, learning the restaurant has run out and instead opting for the filet mignon.  Here\u2019s a weird one. Sam Allardyce, freshly installed as the new Crystal Palace manager, is cross. Specifically, cross with Wilfried Zaha for the crime of choosing to represent the country of his birth. Even more specifically, cross with Zaha to the point of selling him for \u00a330m. Apparently Allardyce is so vexed with Zaha\u2019s decision to play for Ivory Coast in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations that he\u2019d rather be rid of him completely and have the money, even though Zaha will be gone for a month, tops, and perhaps an even shorter spell if things don\u2019t work out for them there. Still, if Zaha is available, then Tottenham are keen.

Jos\u00e9 Mourinho seemed dead set on bringing Benfica defender Victor Lindelhof to Manchester United, but has now apparently decided things are fine at the back and they won\u2019t bother. In addition to a man not arriving, another seemingly won\u2019t be leaving, as United have wagged their collective finger at Anthony Martial and told him he won\u2019t be leaving for Sevilla on loan, not on your nelly young man. However one move that does sound rather plausible is Marcos Rojo, who could be taking his absurd two-footed challenges with him to Valencia.  You\u2019ll probably be aware that Liverpool are among the clubs testing the water for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, but did you know that they\u2019re also sniffing around PSG\u2019s winger Jes\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez? And did you also know that Arsenal have apparently ear-marked Marco Reus to replace Alexis S\u00e1nchez, should the Chilean leave? Well, yes, probably you did, as the gossip columns have featured little else in recent weeks. Also in the news is speculation that Max Allegri wants the Arsenal job, should Arsen\u00e9 Wenger ever retire. Carl Jenkinson, that hapless son of banter, should be leaving the Emirates in January, with five clubs \u2013 specifically Watford, Hull City, Swansea, West Ham and Aston Villa \u2013 keen.

In fact, 2016 was a year of continued economic slowdown and political tightening as the leaders of one-party China sought to further assert their control over the country with one eye on economic storm clouds ahead. Free speech was increasingly curtailed while prominent activists continued to languish in jail after the launch of a major crackdown on human rights lawyers in 2015. Beijing continued to ignore muted international calls for their release. In Hong Kong, the former British colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, the mood was scarcely more upbeat, with renewed street protests after Beijing moved to bar two pro-independence politicians from taking up their seats in the city\u2019s parliament. Pro-democracy campaigners accused Beijing of stripping Hong Kong of its much-cherished autonomy and warned that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework under which it is ruled was being increasingly undermined by the Communist party\u2019s meddling.

That reaffirming of Xi\u2019s supreme leadership will strengthen him in the lead-up to the 19th Communist party congress next autumn, when his assumed 10-year term reaches the half-way point. But daunting challenges lie ahead in 2017. The run-up to that congress will see an intense and potentially treacherous period of political jockeying as Xi attempts to deepen his control of the party by elevating allies to key positions.  The economy, already growing at its weakest rate in 25 years, is likely to slow further as China\u2019s export- and investment-driven boom continues to run out of steam. Xi will also face a number of severe foreign policy headaches, not least formulating a response to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency in the US and potential policy shifts on issues such as North Korea.  Then there is the South China Sea. China has been locked into a series of acrimonious territorial disputes with neighbours such as Vietnam and the Philippines. In July, an international tribunal infuriated Beijing when it responded to a case brought by the Philippines by issuing a thorough rebuke of China\u2019s sweeping historical claims to vast areas of the $4.5tn trade route. Beijing immediately rejected the ruling.  The May election of Rodrigo Duterte looked to have eased some of those tensions with the Philippines\u2019 new leader flying into Beijing in October to kick off an unexpected rapprochement with Xi that saw the territorial dispute brushed aside. In the wake of that visit \u2013 which analysts described as a major strategic coup for China and a thumb in the eye of Washington, a longtime ally of the Philippines \u2013 Beijing and Manila appeared to set aside their differences over the South China Sea in favour of economic collaboration.
