Morgan was yesterday confirmed as a candidate to succeed Percy Sonn in cricket&apos;s top job but his opponent is the formidable Sharad Pawar, the chairman of the Indian board who has the support of the four Asian-bloc nations that sit on the ICC&apos;s main board. Morgan&apos;s first challenge will be to convince a six-man committee, chaired by the Indian AC Muttiah, that he should receive its recommendation. Muttiah&apos;s vote and that of Mueen Afzal, representing India and Sri Lanka and Pakistan and Bangladesh respectively, are likely to go to Pawar. Morgan can count on Australia and New Zealand and will focus on winning support from West Indies, South Africa and the associate member nations, represented by Imran Khwaja of Singapore.

Lord Stevens seeks FA help Lord Stevens&apos; Quest bungs inquiry team, led by its managing director, Nigel Layton, hopes to meet Football Association officials this week to ask for help in the next stage of its investigation. Having failed to produce evidence of irregular payments during its nine-month inquiry, Quest needs Soho Square&apos;s assistance to force eight agents to cooperate with its inquiries into 17 transfers that remain suspicious. The FA&apos;s head of governance, Jonathan Hall, and the compliance unit will consider the request for help on a case-by-case basis but have yet to see details of what Quest has uncovered. The meeting will help clear the air after Lord Stevens outraged the FA chief executive, Brian Barwick, with his criticisms of the compliance unit. Grave for Spurs founder Tottenham are considering a request to help mark the 100th anniversary of the death of the club&apos;s founder, John Ripsher, who currently lies in an unmarked grave in Dover. Ripsher&apos;s inauspicious resting place was located by Peter Lupson, a historian, and after coverage in the Guardian the club are considering how they can help. The Tottenham Tribute Trust, an independent charitable body, has agreed to pay for a headstone and is in discussions with Ripsher&apos;s family about the project. Lupson would like to see a plaque erected at the site in September and is hopeful that the club, who celebrate their 125th anniversary this year, will help. Arsenal fans break flag ban Arsenal fans protested against a ban on national flags being displayed at the Emirates Stadium last night, unfurling bunting in defiance of the ruling before the game against Charlton. The club are believed to have imposed the ban after complaints from members of the Greek-Cypriot community at the appearance at the stadium of the flag of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a state recognised only by Turkey, but the ban includes the St George&apos;s cross and more pertinently the French tricolour. England split over lunch England&apos;s cricketers delivered a much-improved batting display on day one of the Sydney Test but they are still loth to party together, it seems.

Alain de BottonPhilosopher Most ideas about what there is to &quot;see&quot; in a country are unfairly focused on the cultural realm: temples, museums etc. But that&apos;s to miss out on the pleasures offered by what you could call &quot;industrial tourism&quot;. For instance, if you&apos;re off to Holland make sure you see Rotterdam container port, or in France contemplate going on a tour of the the Airbus factory in Toulouse. If a key aspect of travel is a desire to learn how people in other countries really live, it makes sense to look at where they go to work.  4 Giles FodenAuthor, The Last King of Scotland Formerly known as the Graf von Gotzen, the Liemba is a WWI-vintage German battleship that still plies between Tanzania and Zambia as a ferry on Lake Tanganyika, the world&apos;s longest lake.

Benedict AllenExplorer  Of all the deserts in the world, the Namib is the most bewitching; it&apos;s alive with colour, variety and texture. And my favourite haunt is the glorious giant lump of red rock which is the Brandberg. Though bypassed by most guidebooks, it&apos;s magnificent. The Bushmen nomads patterned its ochre slopes with pictures of the animals they lived among. The zebras and giraffes are still there, the Bushmen now gone - and this lends this harsh paradise a sense of mystery, of ancient stories left half told. \u00b7 Benedict Allen&apos;s Into the Abyss: Explorers on the Edge of Survival is published by Faber, \u00a318.  MyloDJ  The Sziget Festival in Budapest is held every August in this huge park on Obudai island, in the middle of the Danube. It&apos;s one of Europe&apos;s biggest festivals (nearly half a million people over the week), but - unlike some euro-festivals, eg Benecassim - there aren&apos;t really any Brits there. The line-up is great - Franz Ferdinand and Radiohead headlined last year, and I DJed in the dance tent on the last night; the last tent to close in the whole festival - a real honour - it was complete and utter chaos.  Tim MooreWriter Absorbed some years ago into a global chain, the Mercure Grand Splendid in Dax has somehow survived the ruthless homogenising process to emerge with its cultured character intact. The vast dining room pays majestic tribute to the 1920s spa boom, and though the modernised rooms don&apos;t, they retain the proportions of a grander age. Warm-mud enthusiasts can repair to the big glass box next door for the lavishly overhauled spa. The bottom line, though, is the bottom line: because no one ever goes to Dax, with a little internet shopping you can bag a night at the hotel for euros 43.  \u00b7 Dax is 30km inland from Biarritz.

There&apos;s no good reason not to do this ... you will brighten up your own day and theirs while doing no harm to anyone.  Laura JamesAuthor, Cool Camping  Deepdale Farm, in Burnham Deepdale, North Norfolk, is my favourite campsite. As well as being just across the road from the sea, it&apos;s also close to all the famous local landmarks. You can take your own tent, but if you want an extra luxurious camping break, there are tipis to rent. The Deepdale Cafe is reputed to serve the best cooked breakfast in the county. The campsite is quiet and friendly, the atmosphere straight out of the 1950s and once a year there&apos;s even a jazz festival. \u00b7 Cool Camping is published by Harper Collins, \u00a39.99. John ConstableMD, STA Travel  In Western Australia, I slept under the stars at a campsite on an amazing stretch of coast called 80 Mile Beach - about 300km south of Broome and some 230km to the nearest town. It is about 100m from your tent or caravan to the beach, which stretches as far as the eye can see and is virtually deserted. Dolphins play in the surf and between June to October whales migrate past really close to shore. \u00b7 80 Mile Beach Caravan Park: 0061 8 9176 5941.  Guy BrowningWriter Always carry a big white handkerchief. It&apos;s the closest you can get to a Swiss army knife and still get through security. It can act as a bandage and tourniquet, a useful dinner jacket accessory, a water filter, a face mask and a bargaining tool with primitive tribes. You can also whip it out and demonstrate the English native Morris dance. Finally, you never know when you&apos;re going to need to wave a white flag from the window of a hotel that&apos;s being shelled by anti-government forces. And, if push comes to shove, you can blow your nose.

Dr Richard DawoodTravel medicine specialist  Keeping kids happy on a long flight can be a real challenge for the exhausted parent. Children over the age of two can sometimes be helped to fall asleep by taking an anti-histamine - such as Phenergan or Vallergan. Discuss it with your doctor, but be warned: when it works well, it works like a dream; but some children can become hyperactive, making a difficult situation potentially very much worse. Nick Creagh-OsborneManager, the Travel bookshop, Notting Hill, London Four hours by bus from Alexandria, lonely and isolated in hundreds of miles of desert lies the oasis of Siwa. One can still visit the little acropolis complex where Alexander the Great was assured that he would one day rule the world. On the edge of the Great Sand Sea, Siwa is more Berber than Arab and has long been famous for the groves of date palms stretching to the horizon. Winding sandy lanes lead out to little villages and secret walled gardens, past bubbling springs where one can bathe looking out across the immensity of the desert.

Barbara HadrillThe woman who refuses to fly Eco-tourism&apos;s not about flying to an eco-lodge in South Africa, and going on safari. It&apos;s about thinking about every part of your trip, and trying to minimise its impact. I travelled overland to Australia, to be a bridesmaid at a friend&apos;s wedding, without flying. From my home in Wales, it took me 45 days on trains, boats, buses, coaches, taxis and my feet to get to Brisbane.

But more than five days after taking off from Surabaya, Indonesia&apos;s second-biggest city, the whereabouts of the Boeing 737-400 and its 102 passengers remain unknown. Not a single seat cushion or lifejacket has been found despite one of the biggest hunts seen in the world&apos;s fourth most populous nation. Although it is assumed that the 17-year-old plane - which had seven previous owners - has gone down in the deep waters or jungles of this sprawling archipelago, the failure to find wreckage or survivors has caused anguish to the relatives, embarrassment to the government and prompted aviation experts to question how a 40 metre (130ft) airliner can vanish without trace in an age of satellite monitoring and radar tracking. The Indonesian authorities have used everything from military jets to traditional shamans in their search among the forested ravines of western Sulawesi - near the last known location of the plane. But they have been plagued by difficult terrain, poor weather and misleading rumours, which have complicated a hunt across a search area the size of Ireland and led to false reports of survivors. Flight KI 574 took off at 12.59 on New Year&apos;s Day with six crew and 96 passengers, including 11 children. It should have been a routine flight for Adam Air, one of an increasing number of new private operators in Indonesia&apos;s deregulated airline industry. But about an hour into the journey the pilot called air traffic control in Makassar to report fierce crosswinds of up to 74 knots at the cruising altitude of 10,000 metres. In what is believed to be his last verbal contact the pilot asked for new coordinates so that he could navigate the craft to less turbulent air. There was no Mayday distress call, but air traffic controllers saw the plane change course twice and then disappear from their radar screens at 14.07. What happened in the minutes after that is still unknown, but the mystery is already a calamity: a lesson in how not to run an aviation industry and the difficulties of conducting a search in such a remote region. It has prompted ministerial apologies, a presidential inquiry and a mixture of scepticism and sympathy from the outside world. Families of the victims - many of them still waiting at the destination - have been exasperated by the lack of progress and the confused announcements from the search team. &quot;How could a plane disappear for several days without any clues whatsoever?&quot; Junus Tombokan asked reporters as he waited for his nephew in Manado. Relatives&apos; hopes were cruelly raised on Tuesday, when the government announced that 12 survivors had been found among the wreckage. Helicopters and a search team of hundreds was sent to the site. But the miracle escape - as it was briefly labelled - proved to be a rumour, prompting an embarrassed apology from the transport minister. &quot;I don&apos;t understand how the authorities could be so heartless and spread rumours without thinking of the suffering of those waiting for news of their loved ones,&quot; said Ima Kulata, who was awaiting word about her cousin and two nieces. &quot;How come they make such fools of us?&quot; Thanks partly to the presence of foreigners, including three US citizens, among the passengers the government has devoted huge resources to the search. According to local media more than 2,000 police and soldiers have joined the hunt, many trudging on foot up muddy ravines in driving rain. In the hills near Majene superstitious locals sacrificed a buffalo and sought the advice of a shaman to aid their search. In the air the military has deployed three army helicopters and four fixed-wing airforce planes, with support from a Singaporean Fokker-50. On the water naval dinghies and surveillance craft, including the Baruna Jaya equipped with deep sea sensors, are searching for wreckage. Just over half of the Adam Air&apos;s flightpath was over water, including the Java Sea and the Maluku Sea. Officials widened the scope yesterday to include nearby seas and more distant areas of jungle. Putting aside national pride, they have accepted technical assistance from Singapore and the US. But search teams have few clues where to look because the pilot could have flown hundreds of miles after dropping below the range of the radar screen and Indonesia - one of the poorest nations in Asia - has had technical problems tracing where the plane might have gone next. Tiora Hardjo, chair of Indonesia&apos;s national transport safety committee, said the aircraft was carrying two beacons which transmit their location in the event of a crash via a radio frequency to satellite. The emergency locator transmitter sends a signal automatically if it detects the strong G-forces of a crash on land. The underwater locator beacon does the same for a crash over water. The beacons have enough power to last around 48 hours. But locating the beacons has been complicated by the fact that several transmissions had been detected, said Mr Hardjo. &quot;We don&apos;t know if they are from the same aircraft or from other beacons. There are no [other] aircraft emergencies reported in that area.&quot; If radar coverage of the area were good enough a crashed plane would still give a clear signal. It has not been possible to locate the plane using radar, suggesting it is obscured by mountains. Transport minister Hatta Radjasa blamed bad weather for the crash. Aviation experts believe the ageing plane may have suffered a mechanical failure, resulting in a sudden dive and the mid-air break-up of its fuselage. But contact with air traffic control indicated no such problems. &quot;Whatever happened to the plane it was likely rapid and catastrophic,&quot; Patrick Smith, a US-based airline pilot and aviation commentator, told the Associated Press. &quot;In many accidents there are no distress calls because the crew is too busy dealing with the situation rather than calling around for help.&quot; The botched handling of the search is not the only awkward issue for the government. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered an evaluation of the nation&apos;s transportation system. Critics have said the crash is proof of poor safety standards in a transport industry that has expanded and deregulated rapidly in recent years to fly and ferry the 220m population around the 17,000 islands that make up the archipelago.

It combines some of Intrepid&apos;s shorter trips, which are also sold separately. &apos;It&apos;s almost impossible to measure the carbon emissions from a 130-day trip,&apos; said a spokeswoman. &apos;There&apos;s one flight to Singapore, but by using local transport and trains to cover long distances, it is a highly eco-friendly way to travel.&apos; Tour companies that have offered long-haul overland adventures for years are noticing a growing interest from people with environmental concerns. &apos;Traditionally, people have travelled overland to experience on a daily basis the ever-changing faces and places of the world, rather than the back of an aircraft seat,&apos; says Charlie Hopkinson, director of Dragoman, which sells bus trips of between three and 53 weeks&apos; duration that span one or more continents and, again, combine a number of shorter trips. &apos;We believe that with the increasing awareness of the negative impact of flying, more people will look at our longer overland journeys as an alternative to flying. These travellers also understand the importance of spending their money in local communities, rather than with airlines and international hotel chains.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/08/theairlineindustry.indonesia", "sentences": ["The US has been helping with the search, as has Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-08T10:51:23Z", "title": "Metal found in search for Indonesian plane", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Indonesia", "Travel", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Indonesian ships searching for an airliner that disappeared a week ago have detected metal on the seabed close to where it vanished, a naval commander said today. Adam Air Flight KI 574, a Boeing 737-400 travelling from Surabaya, Indonesia&apos;s second-biggest city, to the resort of Manado, disappeared with 102 people on board. An Indonesian naval vessel detected the metal in three locations within a small radius off the western coast of Sulawesi island, Gatot Sudijanto said. &quot;If that metal turns out to be what we are looking for, then thanks be to God,&quot; he added. A US Navy ocean mapping ship carrying more sophisticated sonar equipment was heading to the scene to check the metal, which lies more than 5,000ft below the surface. Also today, rescue workers said they had saved 14 people who spent nine days drifting in a liferaft after a ferry sank between two Indonesian islands. Hundreds are feared to have died in the sinking. Fifteen people in all were picked up by a passing cargo ship but one died soon afterwards, Ketut Purwa, the regional search and rescue head, said. There were 628 people on the Senopati Nusantara car ferry when it sank after being pounded by heavy waves as it travelled between Borneo island to Indonesia&apos;s main island, Java, on December 29. Around 245 have since been found alive. While only 10 bodies have been recovered, a navy spokesman said today that it was believed hundreds of bodies were trapped inside the lower decks of the ferry. The long search for the plane has seen more than 3,000 soldiers and police fan out over a remote area of jungles and mountains the size of Ireland. Planes, helicopters and ships have scoured the ocean. It had been buffeted by storms and 80mph winds, forcing it to change course twice during its journey. The 17-year-old aircraft, which had seven previous owners, disappeared from radar screen over Majene, on Sulawesi&apos;s west coast. The pilot did not issue a mayday or report technical problems beforehand. Relatives have endured an agonising wait, made worse a day after the plane disappeared when the authorities wrongly reported that the wreckage had been found along with 12 survivors. The reports turned out to have been rumours spread by villagers and picked up by rescue workers. Three Americans, a man from Oregon and his two daughters, were among the plane&apos;s 96 passengers. The US has been helping with the search, as has Singapore. Adam Air is one of around 30 budget carriers that sprang up in Indonesia after the air industry was deregulated in 1998. The rapid expansion has brought cheap flights throughout Indonesia, but has raised concerns about maintenance of the leased planes.

The index of leading shares closed up 69.4 points at 6230.1. The shock decision to increase interest rates by a quarter point to 5.25% at midday caused a brief scare, and the index fell as much as 60 points, before beginning to recover an hour and a half later. The miners outweighed the impact of the interest rate decision, with BHP Billiton topping the list of FTSE 100 risers. Shares in the world&apos;s largest miner rose 43.5p to 930p. Xstrata was up 91p to \u00a323.99, Rio Tinto increased 100p to \u00a326.49, and Kazakhmys edged up 40p to \u00a310.53.

Shares in the engine maker rose 13.75p to 468.75p. AstraZeneca increased 42p to \u00a328.36 after it announced a worldwide collaboration with US pharmaceutical group Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) to develop and commercialise the latter&apos;s two diabetes drugs. One of these, Saxagliptin, is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials, and - if successful - should be filed for regulatory approval in the first half of 2008. The other one, Dapagliflozin, is in Phase 2b development. Investors breathed a sigh of relief at this piece of news as AstraZeneca&apos;s late-stage pipeline has been looking increasingly bare after a series of Phase 3 drugs were unsuccessful. This should replenish the pipeline to a certain extent. The financials of the deal were also considered favourable towards both AstraZeneca and BMS. But despite the relatively small impact of the interest rate decision, some stocks still took a hit following the announcement. Property and building companies were amongst these. Land Securities was high up on the list of FTSE 100 fallers, down 38p to \u00a321.65. Persimmon dropped 15p to \u00a314.57, Liberty International was down 11p to \u00a313.35, and British Land was off 7p to \u00a315.73. On the FTSE 250, others followed suit. St Modwen shed 20.5p to 551p, Redrow was down 22p to 668.5p, followed closely by Bovis Homes, which slid 28p to \u00a310.56. Some of the banking stocks were also impacted by the rate rise. Northern Rock shed 16p to \u00a311.58, and HBOS fell 11p to \u00a311.45. In addition, a series of disappointing trading statements weighed on the FTSE 100. Alliance Boots headed the list of FTSE 100 fallers following its update. The group, created from the \u00a38bn merger of Boots and Alliance Unichem last summer, posted a 1.5% rise in underlying UK retail sales in the last three months of 2006 - a figure that disappointed analysts as they had been 4.5% ahead for the half year. Shares in the company fell 22.5p to 811p. J Sainsbury fell 4.25p to 410.25p despite announcing a 5% rise in third quarter underlying sales excluding fuel and a record Christmas period. But investors were unexcited about the figures, which matched City expectations but no more than that. In the FTSE 250, Spectris topped the list of risers as it said sales for the year increased by about 6%, and operating margins improved. Profit before tax is expected to be ahead of &quot;most analysts&apos; estimates&quot;. Shares in the company, which makes electronic controls, soared 62p to 808.5p. Taylor Nelson Sofres, the market research firm, came a close second when it said it had made good progress in restructuring its troubled US custom division since it issued a profit warning in July. Shares rose accordingly by 15.5p to 221p. But some analysts said the details were too sketchy. Panmure Gordon said adjusted operating profit was expected to be in line with expectations, but added there was &quot;little solid detail on what is happening at US custom&quot;. Meanwhile, two companies saw their stock slide on the back of sizeable share placings. Savills, the upmarket property company, fell 5p to 642p as 25.9m shares were sold on behalf of CB Richard Ellis Group, representing just over 19% of the company, at a value of about \u00a3161m.

The shares are understood to have been sold by one or more of the founders of the online gaming company. And finally, in the smaller cap arena, Ark Therapeutics, the biotechnology company, rose 13.25p to 132p as it announced it had had a positive meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its Trinam gene therapy that prevents the blood vessels blocking in kidney dialysis patients who have had vascular surgery. The therapy is at the end of Phase 2 clinical trials, and the FDA has given the green light for it to progress to Phase 3 - or the last stage of drug development. In addition, the US watchdog has also signalled that the company will only need to undergo one Phase 3 trial."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jan/11/architecture.energy", "sentences": ["Ships would set sail from here laden with stone for great building projects around the world, from Singapore to Buenos Aires and beyond."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-11T23:41:18Z", "title": "Jonathan Glancey on a Cornish housing development powered by the elements", "tags": ["Architecture", "Energy", "Communities", "Environment", "Society", "UK news", "Business", "Green building", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "The old Cornish port of Penryn, straddling two creeks and lined with streets that rise and fall like breakers, was once at the heart of the local granite trade. Ships would set sail from here laden with stone for great building projects around the world, from Singapore to Buenos Aires and beyond. Penryn never boasted architecture to match these far-flung, grandiose cities, although it has a vernacular charm and touches of Georgian virtuosity. Now, though, it could become a magnet for anyone and everyone - architects, builders, developers, politicians and perhaps the Duke of Cornwall himself - interested in genuine low-energy design. In fact, the brand new Jubilee Wharf, a creek-side development comprising flats for local people to rent, 12 craft workshops, a public hall, a nursery and shops, might well be the greenest British building to date. Its carbon emissions seem to be a happy zero. It has been built as far as possible from local materials, including red cedar and larch, using local labour. And it fits, in an appropriately ramshackle way, into the higgledy-piggledy fabric of Penryn. From a strictly aesthetic point of view, this cluster of buildings seems curious and even questionable at first. Planners were originally unsure, but saw the light and wisely approved the design. It grew on me quickly, for two reasons. First, this is obviously a very thoughtful project, its look based, although not slavishly, on the happy mess of old nautical buildings beside it. There are boats moored alongside, a few of them gleaming, but mostly battered old sea creatures seemingly held together by thick layers of muddy paint; somehow, it all fits together. Secondly, although new, it is already a welcoming place. The two blocks of the development - one four storeys high, comprising studio workshops with maisonettes above; the other over two storeys, housing a nursery, public hall and cafe - enclose a courtyard, protected from the occasionally fierce coastal wind. People have already moved into the maisonettes, including Andrew Marston, whose development company Robotmother dreamed up Jubilee Wharf, and his wife Alice, who runs the cafe. Marston&apos;s master touch was to commission ZEDfactory (formerly Bill Dunster architects), established in 1998 with a mission to produce intelligent, low-energy buildings; ZED stands for zero energy development. Bill Dunster has long practiced what he preaches. His family home, Hope House in Surrey, is an experiment in green design, while the BedZED flats he designed for the Peabody Trust at Beddington, Surrey, are, despite teething troubles, an important step towards truly sustainable homes. Dunster would like houses to be responsible for their own energy demands. At Jubilee Wharf, four 6kw wind turbines and one 75kw wood-pellet biomass boiler (burning cleanly and efficiently what is effectively compacted rubbish) provide pretty much all the power needed for the development. Solar cells will be added to provide essentially free electricity throughout Penryn&apos;s riviera-like summer, while all parts of the building are highly insulated. The turbines seem quiet when compared with those giants whining on fields and downs around the country, and complement the array of masts rising from boats along the Penryn wharves. The maisonettes are a delight. Warm and cosy, each boasts what would once have been called a &quot;sun lounge&quot;, an enclosed suntrap that retains whatever heat comes in through the living room windows looking out over the estuary. Wind cowls on the maisonette roofs provide ventilation when windows are shut, ushering in fresh air with the prevailing wind. Similar cowls on the roofs of flats at BedZED have seized up over time; the solution here has been wheel hub bearings from Ford Mondeos, designed to spin around for a quarter of a million miles or more. The flats also face into the courtyard, already quietly bustling. A craft fair and a farmers&apos; market are in the offing, while a bike shop has opened, and the cafe, with its warm recycled timber interior, is buzzing. The big public hall has a timber roof shaped like the upturned hull of a boat, and is clad in cheap, hard-wearing zinc. The curved roof is not just there for show; it&apos;s a means of sweeping, or deflecting, sea winds up and over both the courtyard and the block of studio workshops and maisonettes. With so much experimental ingenuity at work, it might be assumed that the cost of Jubilee Wharf has been on the high side. Not so: Andrew Marston&apos;s development has cost \u00a33.6m. Of this, \u00a3470,000 was raised by Carrick district council through Objective One, an EU fund aimed at developing areas where prosperity is 25% below the EU average. A further \u00a3350,000 was provided for the 30-place nursery by SureStart, the government childcare programme. And the cost would have been at least half a million pounds less if the ground beneath the derelict sheds that stood on the site hadn&apos;t been laced with forgotten sewers, and other pitfalls. Jubilee Wharf should prove exceptionally cheap to run. More than this, Andrew Marston and Bill Dunster have shown an intelligent way for small towns to develop, economically and socially. Too many councils give in to the bullying demands of supermarket chains, as if these unsustainable land monsters were the only means of boosting employment and local income. How about a few, or more than a few, variations on the theme of Jubilee Wharf, reflecting the topography, style, local production, sentiments and ambitions of people in different parts of the country? Let&apos;s hope for more developments with the intelligence - if not always the creekside look - of Jubilee Wharf."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/12/ftse.marketforces", "sentences": ["Rolls-Royce also did well following a deal with Singapore Airlines to maintain the Trent 800 engines on the airline&apos;s 58 Boeing 777s."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-12T23:56:43Z", "title": "Marianne Barriaux: market forces", "tags": ["FTSE", "Business"], "article": "On a day that would make the heads of even the most sturdy spin, the FTSE 100 went on a rollercoaster ride as it opened up, plummeted down and climbed back up again to reach an even higher level than it had achieved in morning trading.

Newspapers trumpet soaring share prices, speak of the soft superpower of Bollywood and report gloatingly about companies gobbling up western rivals. The Times of India, the country&apos;s biggest-selling English-language newspaper, has adopted a new slogan: India Poised, Our Time is Now. Despite the hyperbole, what strikes most people when they arrive is the seemingly organised chaos. Cattle roam the capital&apos;s poshest avenues and ragged children beg alongside foreign-made cars and glitzy malls. India&apos;s traditional image is overshadowed by strikingly new ones. Today the country is known for call centres and software companies, blotting out older notions of interminable penury or romantic visions of maharajahs. While jobs are sucked out of Britain and the US to India, the country has gone from begging bowl economy to global giant. But the success of India&apos;s hi-tech sector is still to make an impact on the lives of the 360 million people who live on less than 50p a day. There is little doubt the Indian economy is booming. Growth has averaged 8% since 2003, second only to China. According to investment bank Goldman Sachs, the country&apos;s young population means India has the potential to grow faster than China in the long term. There are few better places to illustrate the changing face of India than Gurgaon, a suburb of Delhi. Ten years ago Gurgaon was a collection of muddy villages with a population of 30,000. Today it is home to more than 600,000 people, many of whom work in multinationals such as Ericsson, Pepsi, GE, Honda, and Nestl\u00e9, who have headquarters in the suburb. A thicket of high-rises and cranes towers over 300 acres of sculpted gardens and Mediterranean-style villas in Gurgaon&apos;s new neighbourhood of Nirvana Country. Prospective owners are offered an Indian dream: houses with air conditioners and Italian marble floors, with 24-hour electricity and water. Fenced-off and privately guarded, the neighbourhood embodies the sanitised charm of western suburban life. It all comes at a cost. House prices in this part of Gurgaon start at 10bn rupees (\u00a3115,000), about 270 times the average Indian&apos;s annual income. This has done little to dampen demand. &quot;When we last offered apartments we sold out all 250 in two hours,&quot; said Vikram Singh, sales manager with Unitech, the real estate company behind Nirvana. &quot;On sales days it is chaos here. We cannot keep up with the buyers.&quot; A notable feature of the new Indian economy is the &quot;reverse brain drain&quot;. More than 40% of Nirvana Country&apos;s housing stock is owned by returnees. Drawn by the money to buy the lifestyle they had overseas, Indians are returning in large numbers. Shiv Dayal, a former banker who worked on Wall Street and in the City, returned last year to start up Langham Capital, a corporate finance house with offices in London, San Francisco and Delhi. The 42-year-old says he moved back home for two reasons: the boom and his children. &quot;We came back because we saw what was happening here and I thought Indian companies would need people to find their way in the world. I also felt personally that I wanted my kids to be Indian, speak the language, have Indian friends. It&apos;s important.&quot; Holy poverty The influence of the returning talent is amplified beyond their numbers. Highly educated and with western cultural perspectives, returning Indians have helped to bury India&apos;s notion of holy poverty. &quot;I think that mindset has completely gone,&quot; said Mr Dayal. Little surprise then that the nation is set to become the world&apos;s fastest wealth creator in the next few years, according to the Boston Consulting Group. In two years there will be 1.1m households with \u00a350,000 in disposal income. The paradox is that poverty abounds in a time of plenty. While a recent study found that one in five teenagers in Delhi are obese, a government report showed that one in three children under three are clinically underweight. India appears not just an underdeveloped society but an unjust one. Ten days ago bulldozers, flanked by riot police, flattened a slum in west Delhi at the request of wealthy residents. Two hundred huts made of bricks and galvanised steel were reduced to rubble in hours. A 12-day-old baby died during the demolition, according to its parents. &quot;The big people do not care for us,&quot; said Puja, the mother of the dead child, whose husband is a construction worker. &quot;We have been here for years and they just wanted to get rid of us to make Delhi look beautiful.&quot; Experts say that the west should not be blinded by India&apos;s poverty figures. Pointing out that the country&apos;s companies have penetrated hi-tech fields such as software and pharmaceuticals, British thinktank Demos warns that London&apos;s &quot;presumed superiority&quot; could breed complacency about India&apos;s potential. The thinkthank says India has 14 million graduates - twice as many as the US - topped up by 2.5 million graduates in science, engineering and IT every year. Yet British companies and universities are doing little to tap the talent pool. Sleepwalking &quot;Britain is sleepwalking out of its special relationship with India because not enough people have woken up to how fast the country is changing,&quot; said Charles Leadbeater, a research associate at Demos and a former Downing Street adviser. Indian executives say that until a few years ago nobody thought India could shake off its slumber. &quot;[Firms] are certainly more respectful now,&quot; said Nandan Nilekani, managing director of Infosys, a software company he helped to found in 1981 with six others and \u00a3200. Infosys this week announced that sales in 2006 would top $3bn and it would spend $300m to create the world&apos;s biggest residential university, with rooms for 13,000 students. &quot;People did not buy the India story back then. Now they do. Indian motor companies will build the $2,000 car, healthcare firms have the $100 hospital operation and Indian banks offer global services at one 10th the cost of western rivals. We are faster, bigger, cheaper.&quot; On the move: Gordon&apos;s world From Mozambique to Mumbai Gordon Brown has clocked up thousands of air miles in recent years as he flies around the world in preparation for his expected premiership. All the trips - apart from the usual International Monetary Fund and EU meetings attended by a chancellor - are designed to underline two key themes: the challenge of new economies in the east and the desperate plight of Africa. The chancellor&apos;s visits in recent years include: \u00b7 January 2005 Visit to Kenya and Tanzania, at the start of Britain&apos;s year-long chairmanship of the G8, where he pledged to help lift Africa out of its &quot;grinding, abject and relentless poverty&quot;. \u00b7 February 2005 First visit to China, which he praised as a &quot;major economic player stabilising the world economy&quot; as he visited the powerhouses of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzen. \u00b7 April 2006 Visit to Mozambique where he pledged to spend \u00a38.5bn over 10 years on primary education in the developing world. \u00b7 May 2006 Africa again, to address a conference in Abuja at the invitation of the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo. He praised Nigeria for its reforms. \u00b7 September 2006 Singapore for annual meeting of IMF and the World Bank in his role as chairman of the IMF&apos;s key policy-making body, the international finance and monetary committee."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jan/14/escape7", "sentences": ["Try and get a few hours layover so both children can work off some excess energy - Singapore airport has lots for kids to do."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-14T12:04:24Z", "title": "Ask Tom: Rock and rafting | Five day safari | Long haul with kids", "tags": ["Travel"], "article": "Letter of the week My flatmate and I are trying to plan a European trip this summer to go to a rock festival as well as doing some whitewater rafting. Is there an area that would provide both these activities? Alternatively, are there two areas that are easy to travel between in the space of two weeks?Jo and Emma, via email There are dozens of festivals all over Europe, though many have yet to announce their line-ups. A couple that you may wish to think about are Eurockeennes (29 June-1 July) in Belfort, eastern France which plays host to top rock, indie and pop acts and Exit (12-15 July) which does much the same but in Novi Sad, Serbia. From Belfort you can head easily into Switzerland to any number of good rafting destinations; the nearest ones operate out of Neuchatel in the Jura and raft the Doubs River. From Novi Sad you can tour down via Belgrade into Montenegro, where the Tara Gorge has some fantastic rafting. Both these events announce line-ups and put tickets on sale in March. Five day safari My partner and I were thinking of going to Kenya at the beginning of April. The plan is to do a five-day safari at the Masai Mara National Park and then four or five days in Zanzibar. Is this a good time to go? I&apos;ve looked at a few safari companies, which all look similar. Can you recommend one? Fritzie Cruz, by email When it rains - and the wet seasons have been unreliable over the past few years - it generally does so between March and the end of May and from October to December. The peak season is January and February, when animals are congregating around shrinking waterholes, making them easier to spot. Operators don&apos;t recommend heading to the Masai Mara in April; not many lodges stay open, and you can find yourself driving through thick mud. It&apos;s an even worse time for a beach holiday on Zanzibar. If you have to travel in April, try southern Africa. Botswana&apos;s Okavango Delta and Mozambique&apos;s gorgeous coast (as visited by Gemma Bowes in last week&apos;s Escape) are both excellent at this time.  Aardvark Safaris (01980 849160) suggests four nights at Tanda Tula on the edge of the Kruger National Park, together with five nights at Thonga Beach Lodge on the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa. Prices start from \u00a32,987 per person, including flights, accommodation, all meals and safari activities.  Long haul with kids We have been invited to stay with friends in Margaret River, Western Australia, in November, and plan to travel business class. We have two children, who will be three and one-and-a-half by that time, and are keen to make the trip as stress-free as possible for them, us and fellow travellers. Any thoughts?Nigel and Harriet Culkin, by email This is a big undertaking and one I would not do unless it was essential. In a few years, both your children will be able to appreciate what a lovely part of the world Margaret River is. At their age, your youngsters will probably be just as happy closer to home and you might be happier not having to take on an epic challenge. If you go, a key question is whether to buy your youngest a seat. BA, in common with many other airlines, allows infants (under two years old) to share your seat, at 10 per cent of the seat price. Buy a separate seat and you&apos;ll pay the usual child&apos;s fare (valid for those under 12): 75 per cent of the adult rate.  Cartoons, colouring books and games should keep your three-year-old busy. For your toddler, there&apos;s going to be a lot of work to do. Take toys that don&apos;t include small parts, such as hand puppets. Having a beaker for drinks during take-off and landing will help avoid ear blockages. Try and get a few hours layover so both children can work off some excess energy - Singapore airport has lots for kids to do. \u00b7 We welcome letters.

We spent four days in Havana which was gorgeous and then we spent three days in a grotty all-inclusive &apos;five-star&apos; coastal resort where the food was on rotation, but you have to go there for the gorgeous beaches. I love a mix of the two. It&apos;s a shame really that Rome doesn&apos;t have a beach. My top travel tip is ...To get an upgrade always travel with a neck brace. My friend&apos;s done it. You just say &apos;hello&apos; very gingerly. If you get a sympathetic check-in girl, she&apos;ll upgrade you. If they don&apos;t, just cough ever so slightly and then scream in pain! That always works. I&apos;ll never go back to ...Surat Thani in Thailand. Every backpacker has to go there to get the ferry out to these beautiful islands like Koh Samui, but Surat Thani is just vile. The food is disgusting. Everyone just eats Pringles. The thing is you know you&apos;re only one ferry away from paradise, but you&apos;re stuck there and it just rubs it in even more.  My favourite hotel is ...The Riverbank Park Plaza on the Albert Embankment in London. I live in Manchester so when I&apos;m filming in London I&apos;m put up there. They give me this suite with an amazing view of Westminster, Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament and at night when it&apos;s all lit up you can see St Paul&apos;s in the distance. It&apos;s the best view in London. My first trip was ...Flying to Mexico was my first ever &apos;Oh my God&apos; experience with more than two hours on a plane. I remember on my 23rd birthday being in Palenque where the Mayan ruins are. All these fireflies started coming out. It was out of this world. My most memorable meal was in ... Cuba. I decided to push the boat out for dessert. There was a choice between ice cream and a &apos;Cuban Delicacy&apos;. My friend had the ice cream, which looked delicious. I chose the Cuban Delicacy. I got what looked like two strips of Dairylea in a bowl of apricot jam. It was vile! And the Cuban guy kept coming back to ask, &apos;You like, you like?&apos; I had to smile and say: &apos;Mmm, yes. Delicious.&apos; I was dry heaving. I always bring back ...A fridge magnet for my Mum. She has so many she can hardly see the fridge.  The best beach I&apos;ve ever seen was ...Isla Mujeres.

My favourite place is ...Sydney. It&apos;s so open and the people are very friendly. If you go to places such as Malaysia or Indonesia you get the beautiful beaches but sacrifice the shopping and nice hotels and social scene. In Sydney, you get the best of both worlds. My favourite comedy festival is in ...Kilkenny in Ireland, about an hour from Dublin. Sod Edinburgh - Kilkenny is what a festival should be. It&apos;s just a weekend and it&apos;s in pubs.

I&apos;ve beaten my way here to GU Towers, through rain-swept half-deserted streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights in cheap hotels. Hell, there may even have been a few sawdust restaurants with with oyster shells. Or perhaps that was just my imagination. It has been very, very windy in London today, and rooftop debris is scattered across the town.  I figure the only people up for this one are the chronic insomniacs (try eating more lettuce - I read an article in Readers Digest), hardcore masochists, and people in strange time zones. If you&apos;re one of the last, why not write in with some details of the weather where you are. If anyone is undergoing something more extreme than the gales, I&apos;d love to know about it - some small consolation for being here.  And why am I here again? Excuse my confusion - I followed a late supper of fish and chips and a brace of ales with a short nap in front of the mostly woeful movie, Predator 2. Andrew Symonds bears more than a passing resemblance to the Predator. It is mainly the haircut, a little to do with the batting helmet, and a little more to do with the height of the man and his wide, sculpted forehead. Not that he has retractable mandibles on his mouth, mind. This means one thing: England need either: a) Arnold Schwarzenegger, or b) Danny Glover.  Of course they got neither, and must chose instead from one of Ravi Bopara and Mal Loye to take the place of the missing Michael Vaughan. I hope they go Loye. Like Glover, he may well be &quot;too old for this sh..&quot; but he has earned a chance with his prolific one-day form for Lancashire and will almost certainly try to slog-sweep Glenn McGrath for six. Bopara, aged 21, is not so good as to be able to survive being thrown into this sinking ship of an England team. Loye, on the other hand, has nothing to lose.  So, Steve and Mary want to know: &quot;with several of the Aussie team on holiday...this may make an interesting contest?&quot; I don&apos;t think that the number is several, certainly Ponting has decided to sit this one out. Gilchrist is not a great captain, and if England weren&apos;t lacking both KP and Vaughan I&apos;d be inclined to agree with you. But they are, and this winter has taught me to prize my optimism too highly to squander on this England team. I think they&apos;ll get stuffed again.  Speaking of captains, enough has been said about England&apos;s own problems here. Let these stats suffice for my views on the matter. The total number of matches, excluding age-group games, in which Flintoff has captained = 30, total of those matches won = 6. The same figures for Strauss: captained 112, won 42. Who would you rather have captain in crisis? The rookie or the pro? England have won the toss and will bat first. So Australia will have to bat under lights and brave the dew, which is an advantage for England. Team news is this: Mal Loye does play, and, more surprisingly, so does Chris Tremlett, in place of Monty Panesar. Michael Peart has totally failed to improve my mood with this missive: &quot;Lots of blue sky in Koh Samui Thailand. Although it did rain in the middle of the night. Off for a swim&quot;. And now some team news. For England: Loye, Strauss, Bell, Joyce, Flintoff, Collingwood, Nixon, Dalrymple, Tremlett, Lewis, Anderson.  And for Australia: Hayden, Gilchrist, Hodge, Clarke, Hussey, Symonds, White, Lee, Johnson, Bracken, McGrath.  A good question from Kieren Purnell &quot;Before we all start to bemoan the lack of depth and quality in the English batting order, I would like to ask where is Alastair Cook? If he is the best young player in the country, surely he is worth considering in the one day format.&quot; And this is a fine thought from Martin Thorpe: &quot;Weather is hot and humid in Sydney. The most &quot;extreme&quot; thing I&apos;ve done today - in celebration of our glorious victory over New Zealand - is etched back a tiny bit of the red which my work colleagues kindly removed from my cross of St George. If we win today I might colour in a bit more.&quot; 1st over: England 3-0 (Strauss 1 Loye 2) Well, before we know it, we&apos;re off and playing. Lee takes the new ball, having recovered from his chest infection: presumably symptoms of a broken heart if his Bollywood chart-topping hit single is anything to judge by. Mal Loye&apos;s first ball in international cricket is a yorker, and his second a half-volley which he pushes down the ground for two. And we&apos;ve found, thanks to Nich Hills, some extreme weather: &quot;Yesterday afternoon Canberra was the hottest city in Australia. Today we&apos;re facing a top of 35&apos;C (95&apos;F) with tomorrow 38&apos;C (100&apos;F). Our highest temperature this month has been 40.5&apos;C.&quot; 2nd over: England 5-0 (Strauss 2 Loye 3) And from the other end, Nathan Bracken immediately swings the ball. Too much so for Strauss, who struggles to lay bat on ball, shovelling one single around the corner. Phineas Butterphat emails me with typo corrections, Clare A Davis with some tenuously linked poetry quotations, who do you think I&apos;ll publish? Clare, of course: &quot;by the end of this tour we may be thinking I did not know death had undone so many when remembering woeful England innings. Ha. Anyway, you probably won&apos;t believe this but here in my remote corner of NE Scotland we&apos;ve had neither wind, rain nor snow all day and the night seems remarkably quiet out there. For once. &quot; 3rd over: England 9-0 (Strauss 3 Loye 6) Loye clips a neat three runs with a leg-glance. He has actually been playing cricket in New Zealand, waiting on an injury in the England team to free up a space for him. He knows he has to seize his chances, last time he had one was back in 1998. The selectors told him he&apos;d been picked for the Sri Lanka Test, only to gazump him hours later by announcing that Steve James had been picked instead. Somewhere in Hong Kong, Tim Maitland is suffering: &quot;By cold... we&apos;re talking 17-20 degrees C... but it&apos;s the only place in the world where 17-20 degrees feels bloody freezing. Also got heckled yesterday by a near-geriatric Irish couple on the underground about how bad English cricket is. How can we have sunk so low?&quot;  4th over: England 12-0 (Strauss 6 Loye 6) When Dominic Cork had Nathan Bracken&apos;s haircut, he got laughed off every cricket pitch in the land. We shouldn&apos;t let him with it. His swing ensured five dot balls, but tee-ed up a leg-side clip for three by Strauss as well. Mark Downing is experiencing events as unlikely as an England win: &quot;It can&apos;t really compete with the gales you&apos;re experiencing but it actually snowed here yesterday and I happen to live in the valleys north of Los Angeles. Obviously the locals were somewhat confused but I stepped in to explain &apos;cold&apos; and &apos;snow&apos;, and then the murmuring and animal howls quietened.&quot; 5th over: England 24-0 (Strauss 7 Loye 16) Mal Loye unleashes his fantastic signature shot for the first time: a mighty slog-sweep for six, played off one knee. And to Brett Lee as well. Then he does it again, a little edgier, for four. Lee responds with some ripping length balls. Ian Botham asks: &quot;where has Mal Loye been for the last ten years?&quot;. Twelve from the over, and McGrath is warming up. 6th over: England 28-0 (Strauss 7 Loye 20) Loye thumps a four from Bracken&apos;s first ball, which is short and wide. On the subject of ropey haircuts, Patrick McCarry has singled out England&apos;s own Jon Lewis: &quot;When is someone going to have an impolite word in Jon Lewis&apos; ear and tell him that the &apos;Foreigner&apos; look is out? If he shaves that red-setter-ish mop off I&apos;m sure we&apos;d see him bowling quicker than Clark Griswald&apos;s trusty station wagon.&quot;  7th over: England 36-0 (Strauss 15 Loye 20) Henry Humphhreys, two overs ago I&apos;d have agreed with this: &quot;Hey there I\u00b4m tuning in from Argentina. I am fired up and ready to listen to Aggers describe Mal Loye get his teeth knocked out by Brett Lee as he attempts a front foot sweep.&quot; but, incredibly, I&apos;ve just seen Loye pull it off with my own eyes. Surely that is the champagne moment of the day. A clipped drive by Strauss adds two to the total, which is not nearly so good as the six that flies off his top-edge as he attempts a pull off the next ball. Lee licks his lips, his face flickers that rat-like grimace. That is Strauss&apos;s fifth six in 67 ODI matches: a rare thing indeed. 8th over: England 37-0 (Strauss 15 Loye 21) Loye is canny enough not to attempt anything rash against Bracken, blocking five balls and picking up a couple from the sixth. Ross Couper has managed to find gloating Aussies in the unlikliest of places: &quot;It&apos;s just coming up to lunch time here in Seoul. As usual its cold, round about freezing, here with but with cloudless blue skies. Here&apos;s hoping that the team can put one over on the Aussies. My Australian aquaintances have been quite nice about the series, comments like &apos;at least it wasn&apos;t boring&apos;.&quot; 9th over: England 46-0 (Strauss 15 Loye 30) And on comes McGrath. Loye swivel-pulls him for four, a fine looking shot, played on one leg. The ball runs to the rope. In response, McGrath pitches the ball up and Loye drops to one knee and sweeps him for another four around the corner. Really excellent stuff this from Loye, his 30 coming at a run-a-ball. Matthew Edwards, I can&apos;t possibly believe you think my situation is as dire as yours: &quot;I don&apos;t want to make you feel worse, but I&apos;m in Singapore, it&apos;s about 30 degrees outside, a little humid but no gales. The only problem for me is that I&apos;m locked in a room with a load of German auditors. (I&apos;m not sure which of us has the worst deal here!).&quot; German auditors! GU Towers may be bad, but it&apos;s not the eighth circle of hell. Not when Mal Loye is batting, anyway.  10th over: England 47-0 (Strauss 15 Loye 30) &quot;-20 degrees with windchill in Boston yesterday. Take that.&quot; Indeed I will, with relish, Harry Adamson. Davifd Lloyd has just said that this is England&apos;s highest opening partnership in any international on the tour, which seems amazing to me. One single and five dot balls for Bracken.  11th over: England 52-0 (Strauss 15 Loye 36) Loye edges McGrath over the slips for four, McGrath chunters furiously - a glorious sight. Phineas Butterphat has had an incredible day, whcih I assume means &quot;has been out drinking&quot;, are you still up Phineas? Or have I slighted you into sleep? Strauss struggles to get McGrath off the square.  WICKET! Loye 36 c Hayden b Bracken: 12th over: England 56-1 (Strauss 17 Bell 1) Bracken begins his sixth over with a crucial wicket, as Loye lays a thick edge on the ball and it pops neatly to first slip. Bracken has bowled very well, and now has one for ten. A good debut innings for Loye, though a weak dismissal stemming from a wafting shot outside off stump. Bell is in, and England will surely now settle into tedious accumulation. Strauss guides three runs through third man.  WICKET! Strauss 17 c Hodge b McGrath 13th over: England 56-2 (Bell 1 Joyce 0) Brad Hodge has just taken a staggering catch to dismiss Strauss. One of the best bits of fielding in recent memory, destined for future youtube compilations everywhere: Strauss caught a good pull, Hodge leapt to his left at square leg, thrust out his left hand and caught the ball, diving with his full length off the ground. Stunning. And now England are sinking.  14th over: England 58-2 (Bell 1 Joyce 1) Mitchell Johnson has come on. M Boulton is as confused as Strauss was after that catch: &quot;We&apos;re in a drought here in South Australia and can only water our gardens on Sundays in case we drain the Murray! But today we have been hit by a monsoon and are told to expect floods!&quot;  15th over: England 62-2 (Bell 1 Joyce 5) &quot;Also, what&apos;s the over/under on when Gary Naylor will make an appearance? During England&apos;s innings? Maybe around the 20th over? Is he trying to set a world record for the number of OBO appearances?&quot; enquires Ellery Villiers. Actually Ellery, when I came into work and opened ny inbox, there he was, Gary Naylor with a pre-emptive missive as he continues his herculean efforts to take over the world of OBO. Ed Joyce pulls McGrath for four. I&apos;ve not seen much of Joyce, but anyone who has the epithet &apos;Gower-esque&apos; attached to them worries me severely.  16th over: England 69-2 (Bell 8 Joyce 5) Australia have started their final power-play. Bell slashes two runs with a square drive, and adds four more from the next as England seek to take advantage from so ropey bowling by Johnson. Archie Bland is anything but: &quot;It&apos;s been quite unseasonably warm in the big apple, but today it started to snow, and I regretted being the kind of dilbert who thinks fingerless gloves are more efficient. perhaps they&apos;re called fingerless gloves because when you wear them in Harlem in January YOUR BLOODY FINGERS FALL OFF.&quot;  WICKET! Joyce 5 c Gilchrist b McGrath: WICKET! Bell 10 run out White: 17th over: England 71-4 (Collingwood 0 Flintoff 0) Now, not that any one pulled me up on it, but the reason I suspect anyone labelled Gower-esque, is that is generally means that they are flakey outside off stump, and prone to edging behind when playing loose drives. On that note, Joyce does just that and McGrath&apos;s nip-backer catches his inside edge and carries into Gilchrist&apos;s gloves. Next ball Cameron White produces an astonishing run out. As the batsmen totally fail to call the run properly, Bell turns back and forth mid-wicket. White, prone on the ground having just fielded the ball at backward point, rolls over onto his front and flicks the ball backhanded along the ground and into middle stump. Bell is out by yards. Instinctive, inventive cricket from Australia. England are collapsing rapidly. A cup of shrink-wrapped freeze-dried &apos;Genuine Italian roast&apos; coffee fresh from the GU robot means that my calorie intake over the next hour is likely to exceed England&apos;s run-scoring.  WICKET! Collingwood 0 c Gilchrist b McGrath: 18th over: England 72-5 (Flintoff 0 Nixon 1) Oh god. Colly gathers a golden duck, as McGrath produces a fine ball that pitches on middle and cuts away past off, snicking the bats edge as it does so. 52 for 0 to 71 for five and England have lost the match in the space of six overs. As Nixon comes in Louis Skolnick writes: &quot;just saw that fool Nixon practicing his reverse sweeps on the middle of the Gabba - incorrigible.&quot;  19th over: England 72-5 (Flintoff 0 Nixon 1) I can&apos;t summon the sufficient ire for this situation, so I&apos;ll let Sean Davis take over: &quot;The ineptitude is staggering. What the hell were those two clowns playing at? If its not difficult enough, England are trying to get themselves out! Also, why are we persisting with Ed Joyce? He looks like a startled rabbit in the headlights every time.&quot; And Chris Greenwood can chip in as well: &quot;What of Mr Strauss? Ok, so that was a good catch by the sounds of it. And yes he has had some bad umpiring luck. But really, as the senior batsman of the team coming into this tour he really hasn&apos;t performed.&quot; Indeed, Strauss has only one fifty against Australia this winter.  20th over: England 74-5 (Flintoff 2 Nixon 1) What baffles me most is that power-plays are meant to benefit the batting team, but England seem to crumble in them. Ros Bromwich damages McGrath&apos;s reputation with this email much more than England could with their bats: &quot;Looking forward to your commentary this afternoon - it&apos;s 2pm here in my windowless office in sweaty Melbourne. After the 40-plus degree day on Tuesday we awoke this morning to the welcome sound of rain on the tin roof. BTW, I am meeting Glenn McGrath on Tuesday in connection with his recent appointment as the face of the 2007 Sydney Caravan Show in April!&quot;. Cruel to say it, but surely you mean Jason Gillespie?  21st over: England 81-5 (Flintoff 4 Nixon 5) Nixon squirts a squitterring little four through the covers, as Johnson continues to bowl too wide of the stumps. Juna Lee writes: &quot;Need some advice from you and the other OBOers on the following situation: There are two Australians who work on the same floor as I do. They&apos;ve put a picture of the Australian team and one of Shane Warne on a bulletin board near the elevators of our floor. Should I or should I not draw on the gigantic head of Shane Warne?&quot; I couldn&apos;t possibly advocate any course of action other than defacing it, Juna. Flintoff biffs a hook high into the air and the ball plops safely down in an empty patch of grass.  22nd over: England 83-5 (Flintoff 4 Nixon 7) While we&apos;re doing requests, Glen Sutton could do with a hand too: &quot;Any ideas how I can succinctly describe cricket to my Vietnamese English Language students. So far the best that I can do is, &quot;It&apos;s a bit like baseball&quot; which makes me want to rip out my own fingernails with a pair of pliers. Any suggestions more than gratefully received.&quot;  23rd over: England 88-5 (Flintoff 8 Nixon 7) Flintoff salvages an otherwise barren over with a chipped four through long-off.  WICKET! Nixon 9 c Hayden b Lee: 24th over: England 93-6 (Flintoff 13 Dalrymple 0) Brett Lee returns, in an effort to provoke Flintoff into a rash shot and end the game for good. A matter of will here for Flintoff. There are still 150 balls to go, so he has time to play himself in. A moment&apos;s loss of concentration and application though, and he will play himself out with a poor shot. A back foot cover drive bodes well, with the batsmen trotting two runs. Three more come with a bunt through mid-wicket. Unfortunately, for all Freddie&apos;s neat restraint, Nixon is immediately foxed to his first ball from Lee. Utterrly beaten for pace as he hopped onto the back foot, the ball took his edge and sailed into Hayden&apos;s mitts.  24th over: England 95-6 (Flintoff 14 Dalrymple 1) The first advice for Glen (over 22) comes from Patrick Walsh: &quot;Organise your students into two teams: Take two rubbish bins, a tennis ball, anything that resembles a bat, a case of beer, and the afternoon off.&quot; Sounds a lot like an England training session that. Wayne Trotman offers something a little more practical: &quot;My suggestion for Glen is to repeatedly show his Vietnamese language students an action packed cricket video and get the students to tell him the rules. It always works for me. Just make sure the lesson plan contains the magic word &apos;elicit&apos; and &apos;monitoring&apos; and any director observing is sure to be impressed.&quot;  25th over: England 97-6 (Flintoff 14 Dalrymple 1) Dwayne Nicholls has probably the best answer of all for you, Glen: &quot;My suggestion would be to explain that cricket is a sport that&apos;s played in Australia, and leave it at that. Should spare him any embarrasment with follow up questions.&quot; Two runs from a tight Lee over. 27th over: England 105-6 (Flintoff 20 Dalrymple 3) Flintoff pulls a four from outside off and away through straight mid-wicket. Mitchell Johnson is a real luxury for Australia here, his bowling looks unthreatening, but they are so far in front that they can afford to give him the practice. Another wicket and Chris Tremlett will come in and the innings will speed to a close. By the way, in his last seven England innings, Dalrymple has made it to double figures just once. Oh dear.  28th over: England 108-6 (Flintoff 22 Dalrymple 3) Ameer Tadros weighs in with some words that are hard to challenge: &quot;I am so bored of this, when are England actually going to play sustained decent cricket, really, you guys are rubbish....signed...a very bored Australian cricket fan...&quot; Well, Ameer, why don&apos;t you wait for the World Cup, eh? By then your lack of a remotely decent spinner for the one-day team may well be exposed as a match-losing flaw. Probably not by us though. Is that straw free? I need something to clutch.  29th over: England 114-6 (Flintoff 22 Dalrymple 9) Symonds has come on to practice his dobbers. Today he is trying the kind that aren&apos;t supposed to spin, rather than the ones that are meant to, but don&apos;t. Dalrymple late-cuts a couple, and then slices four over the top of Matty Hayden at slip.  WICKET! Flintoff 27 c Hodge b Lee 30th over: England 119-7 (Dalrymple 11 Tremlett 1) Flintoff survives a good lbw shout from Lee, and thumps the next ball straight back over the bowler&apos;s head for six. Except, the six is retracted and ruled to be a four instead after replays reveal it bounced exactly on top of the rope. It is enough to throw Freddie, as all that will to dominate the day&apos;s play evaporates in a skied pick-up to leg that sails high into the air and comes down in Hodge&apos;s hands. Hodge had to dive forward to take the catch, and in a way it was as fine as his first effort to dismiss Strauss. Looking at his averages I always wonder why Hodge is picked for Australia - perhaps the answer is in his superb fielding.  31st over: England 119-7 (Dalrymple 11 Tremlett 1) Symonds hurries through his over, and I miss it entirely as my head is slumped on the desk in despair.  32nd over: England 122-7 (Dalrymple 11 Tremlett 1) Lee bounces Tremlett viciously. A cleaner hovers behind me chuntering at the TV screen. Tremlett drops his bat on a yorker, I drop my head on the keyboard.  33rd over: England 126-7 (Dalrymple 11 Tremlett 5) Tremlett hits a four from a half volley. Matthew Edwards has rediscovered the joys of hanging out with German auditors: &quot;What has happened to our cricket? I&apos;m actually having more fun with in the 8th circle of hell than watching this OBO!&quot;. 34th over: England 135-7 (Dalrymple 20 Tremlett 5) Dalrymple scampers two after a firm;y struck cover drive, and another two with a lofted cut. Then he larrups Brett Lee for four through extra cover. A single makes it nine off the over.  35th over: England 138-7 (Dalrymple 24 Tremlett 6) Andrew Jolly points out, with neat accuracy, that &quot;Watching England play one day cricket is like flipping a beetle on its back and watching it struggle. The Australians watch for about 10 minutes before squashing it.&quot; Three runs from the over. WICKET! Tremlett 8 c Gilchrist b Bracken: 36th over: England 141-8 (Dalrymple 26 Lewis 0) Nathan Bracken returns. Paul Manton offers solace for England fans: &quot;By the way, there is hope on the horizon for England. McGrath&apos;s son would qualify for England due to Jane McGrath.&quot; Sweet. We can offer him a caravan and all the shrimp he can eat - I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be game. Chris Tremlett decides it is sandwich time and guides a catch into Gilchrist&apos;s gloves after Bracken stitched him up with a slower ball.  37th over: England 141-8 (Dalrymple 26 Lewis 0) England are spared another plumb lbw, after Symonds&apos; shout is ignored because the Umpires have decided to have mercy.  WICKET! Lewis 0 c and b Bracken: 38th over: England 145-9 (Dalrymple 29 Anderson 0) Hayden drops a difficult catch after Lewis catches a thick edge. Hayden got both hands to it above his head, but spilled it anyway. Lewis offers an easier chance moments later, dropping his bat on a slower ball and prodding it back at chest height to the bowler. Meanwhile, Dalrymple scurries away, hustling and bustling for ones and twos.  39th over: England 145-9 (Dalrymple 29 Anderson 0) &quot;I assume I&apos;m not the only one who is tired of saying to oneself &quot;It can&apos;t get any worse&quot; - when invariably it does. There must be a bottom to this horror. Oh! hang on we play Canada in the World Cup!!!&quot; Yes, Mark Gilroy we do. Whether that&apos;s as easy as you hope remains to be seen. Canada are captained by John Davison - a gnarled Aussie pro with a Canadian mother. He has the record for the fastest century scored in a World Cup. What is more, England actually invited him to bowl at them in the nets, not realising who he was and how useful that could be to him, earlier this tour. White comes on for a quick bowl.  40th over: England 150-9 (Dalrymple 30 Anderson 0) Kieren Nash has this paragraph all to himself: &quot;Mr Jolly&apos;s beetle analogy reminds me of a comment I heard from a cat-owner: &apos;My cat doesn&apos;t kill birds; she just plays with them until they&apos;re dead.&apos; &quot; WICKET! Dalrymple 31 c Johnson b White 41st over: England 155 all out (Anderson 4) If Jimmy Anderson could just get his bat on the ball, he&apos;d surely get out. He is struggling to do it for two reasons: his batting isn&apos;t good enough, and Cameron White&apos;s bowling a lot of dross down the leg side. White turns the ball less than any spinner I can remember. At which point Dalrymple hoiks a hapless shot straight to long-on, and is out.  Well, we may be used to failure by now, but that was really shoddy by England. A small cameo from Dalrymple and a decent debut from Mal Loye aside, there was nothing of any quality there at all. England were bowled out with eight overs to spare. Really, really mind-numbingly awful cricket, from the top and middle order in particular. Bracken and McGrath both finished with three for 24, and I&apos;m off to stoke up on niccotine.

They have remained steady under the media spotlight, despite political storms that have begun to engulf the project. 2 David Higgins, a veteran of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, has made his mark on the Olympic Delivery Authority, his timely revision of the masterplan for the Olympic Park preventing a time-consuming detour down a planning cul-de-sac. 3 Parliament moved with rare speed, passing the necessary legislation in record time and thus maintaining the post-Singapore momentum. 4 Public support has increased despite continued media reports about rising costs. Latest polling shows 79% backing nationwide for the games, with 75% of Londoners behind the project. 5 There have been glowing reviews so far from the International Olympic Committee - and praise for the early progress, said to be two years ahead of where Sydney was at a similar stage. 6 The political unity that surrounded the bid process has been largely maintained - ministers Tessa Jowell and Richard Caborn have clashed with Conservative spokesman Hugh Robertson, but the opposition has been supportive of the big picture. Fissures have, however, begun to develop and this week&apos;s select committee report will highlight the criticisms. 7 Paul Deighton, London 2012&apos;s chief executive, has set about the task of raising at least \u00a3750m from sponsors to meet the running costs with gusto. The first top tier sponsors are due to be announced soon. 8 Fears of &quot;Swampy&quot; style protests on the Olympic site have proved mistaken - and vociferous opposition from local businesses has largely disappeared. Organisers have possession of nearly 97% of the land. 9 There was incredulity over the \u00a3400m appointment of the CLM consortium as project managers to ensure the games are delivered on time and budget. But construction industry experts say the expertise of CLM - which worked on Heathrow&apos;s Terminal Five and five previous Olympics - is the best in the business and a wise investment. 10 Transport was regarded as London&apos;s biggest Achilles heel during the bid, but its draft plans are well advanced: high-speed Javelin trains are set to arrive at the Olympic Park every 13.87 seconds, carrying more than 250,000 passengers an hour. 11 It took a long time for the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, to agree a \u00a3300m funding package to improve Britain&apos;s 2012 medal prospects - but UK Sport was quick out of the blocks with a tough &quot;no compromise&quot; formula to target support towards the most likely podium contenders. 12 Lord Coe&apos;s rallying cry of inspiring youngsters through the power of sport helped swing votes in Singapore - and it has helped move sport up the political agenda . 13 With five years still to go, more than 100,000 people have already registered their interest in becoming volunteers, 30,000 more than the anticipated requirement for the games. 14 Politicians have continued to stress regeneration as a key ingredient of the 2012 project, an important tactic as the headline cost rises. The neglected Lower Lea Valley has been promised a legacy beyond sport with plans for new homes, jobs and transport links. 15 The ODA will today announce plans to make London the most environmentally friendly games yet, with an \u00a380m wind turbine, solar panels and green roofs on athletes&apos; accommodation. 16 After a false start, the aquatics centre is the first London 2012 venue off the drawing board. Zaha Hadid&apos;s scaled down \u00a3100m pool, with iconic wave-shaped roof looks likely to be an eye-catching attraction. 17 Camelot&apos;s Olympic-related scratchcards and draws are performing ahead of expectations, with \u00a387.2m already in the 2012 coffers against the target of \u00a3750m. 18 Organisers put down a welcome marker over accessibility and affordability: they have pledged that more than half the tickets will cost less than \u00a320. 19 Providing training camps could be one of the big economic benefits - Birmingham, Sheffield and Manchester have been quick to spot the opportunities, and are hoping for cash windfalls of up to \u00a315m. 20 Lord Moynihan has shaken up the British Olympic Association giving it a new businesslike zeal. Sir Clive Woodward&apos;s appointment as director of elite performance may have ruffled feathers at UK Sport, but it is also a welcome signal of intent. 12 things London is getting wrong 1 Uncertainty over the budget has been the single most destabilising feature to hit the project. Headlines have screamed out a succession of speculative totals up to and beyond the \u00a38bn mark, while Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, grudgingly conceded the cost of the Olympic Park had risen by \u00a3900m to \u00a33.3bn - and would inevitably go higher. Everyone is waiting - and waiting - for the revised budget. 2 Jowell is in charge of the Olympics, but the lightweight Department for Culture, Media and Sport is having to play second fiddle to the Treasury. It will be Gordon Brown, below, who decides the budget , and the timing will dovetail with his timetable for inheriting No10. Meanwhile, Jowell will take the flak without being able to provide the answers. 3 Jowell&apos;s memorandum of understanding, drawn up with London&apos;s mayor Ken Livingstone, on how any overspend would be funded was little more than a back of an envelope calculation. No one knows who will pick up the tab: the national lottery, London&apos;s council taxpayers or income tax. 4 The issue of VAT on construction of the venues remains unresolved. It was the most breathtakingly incompetent oversight, and although the potential \u00a3250m bill is likely to be waived, it said little for the robustness of the financial planning. 5 Non-Olympic sports are likely to suffer as lottery cash is siphoned away to the games - and the pips are also starting to squeak for other good causes, including arts, heritage and the Big Lottery Fund. 6 The departure of Jack Lemley as chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority caused more damaging reverberations. The American construction expert fired a broadside against the project in his local Idaho newspaper, while London 2012 figures briefed against him. No one knows yet whether his criticisms were valid. 7 Indecision over the eventual use of the Olympic Stadium still has to be resolved. London promised an athletics legacy, but the viability would be greatly enhanced if West Ham United took it on as their new home. 8 Lemley warned the Stratford site was heavily polluted, while the ODA insists its sampling has found levels of pollution consistent with its former industrial use. The jury is still out. 9 Architects have warned a desire to cut costs could lead toa &apos;plasterboard and tarmac&apos; games. Lord Rogers has criticised the use of &apos;design and build&apos; contracts, fearing bland venues. 10 There is a \u00a3100m black hole in the \u00a3300m package to fund elite athletes. The Chancellor said the money would be raised from the private sector but the sponsorship market is already overstretched and UK Sport says it has no expertise in fund-raising. 11 There is controversy over London 2012&apos;s backpedalling over a pledge to pay a &apos;living wage&apos; to those on Olympic projects. The promise to pay \u00a32 above the minimum wage is now merely a request to firms winning contracts. 12 Great Britain&apos;s involvement in the football tournament is in the balance, with the Scots refusing to play ball."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/23/9", "sentences": ["Fully utilising the new Singapore plant now looks ambitious."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-23T10:43:39Z", "title": "Tate & Lyle: what the analysts say", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Jeff Stent at Citigroup said management&apos;s previous bullishness was misplaced.  &quot;With no capacity constraints impacting sales in the second half of 2007, it is hard from our revised standpoint to see why sucralose sales should now increase materially beyond 2007.

But for one group of international researchers currently at work on the volatile peninsula, it&apos;s young Korean children stricken with terrible communication difficulties, who exhibit strange, obsessive behaviours, that warrant closer attention. The past decade has seen an unprecedented degree of activity in the research of autism spectrum disorders in Britain and the US, where more than $100m (\u00a350.7m) in new research grants has been made available in the past year alone for investigating this still-baffling neurological malady. And most researchers will argue that tangible results in understanding the condition have been achieved through the work, including a consensus that unknown genetic factors are its primary cause, and that its incidence is much higher than once thought. Asian research But successfully arguing for the new models of autism&apos;s wide prevalence and roots in human genes requires wider evidence from global sources. With this in mind, a growing number of researchers this year began fanning out across the Asian continent to collect new data and fine-tune their research tools in countries including China, India, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. The first academic cab off the rank has been a pilot project in South Korea led by a Washington anthropologist, Roy Richard Grinker, who has just published a new book on autism, and Young shin Kim, a Korean-born child psychiatrist? They have been joined by Eric Fombonne, the Canadian scholar responsible for the landmark epidemiological study which established that one in 166 young Britons are afflicted. Already the hurdles are becoming apparent. For one thing, autism research in Asia, with the exception of Japan, has been generally non-existent. But outside researchers are finding other barriers to their efforts, including a strong resistance to the emerging scholarly consensus in the Anglo-American world on autism&apos;s prevalence and causes among many of their Asian counterparts. Michael Hong, a professor of psychiatry at Seoul National University, who is sometimes described as South Korea&apos;s founding father of child psychiatry, is among those Asian researchers who dispute the growing consensus, arguing that autism is not nearly as prevalent as western researchers believe, perhaps afflicting just one youngster in every 10,000. Hong argues that behaviour that is often labelled as autism is rather a largely environmentally caused disorder that mimics autism, known as reactive attachment disorder, the cause of which is largely the fault of the children&apos;s mothers, who have been buffeted about by the winds of cultural change sweeping east Asia. &quot;They don&apos;t really appreciate what&apos;s happening here,&quot; Hong says of the western researchers. Those researchers are not only challenging Hong&apos;s hard-earned reputation, they are also flying in the face of culturally embedded Korean notions about the role of women and the nature of parenting. &quot;It&apos;s seen as a disease that impugns the whole family,&quot; explains Grinker, a professor of anthropology at George Washington University. The work of Grinker&apos;s seven-member team of investigators was made possible through a $120,000 grant from the New York-based Autism Speaks, a non-profit group with offices in Britain and America. The organisation has pledged $13m in new funding during the past year for studies such as the two-year-long South Korean venture, which will screen, assess and analyse data collected in Ilsan, a city of 200,000 near the capital, Seoul, in order to work out the country&apos;s autism prevalence. With its low labour costs and well-established medical networks, South Korea seemed a particularly inviting prospect for such a study, whose design has been modelled on the landmark British effort in Stafford. The new data will test the trustworthiness of existing estimates, which are based on US and British surveys of their respective populations. They will test whether those previous studies could have contained any in-built bias towards the Anglo-American situation. If, say, the incidence of autism in South Korea were found to be much lower than existing western studies suggest, the implications for British research could be tremendous. Grinker doesn&apos;t think that will happen. But, like Hong and Leo Kanner, the child psychiatrist who first described autism in 1943, he once believed that autism was a rare disorder. When his 15-year-old daughter, Isabel, was first diagnosed with the condition, in 1994, he knew almost nothing about it. Grinker says he has strived to improve his own knowledge and that of academia at large. During the same period, autism has surged into the popular consciousness on the back of a tidal wave of media coverage, parental activism and widely published findings showing that the condition once thought to affect as few as one in 10,000 children - Leo Kanner&apos;s number - affected as many as six in every 1,000. The results of Grinker&apos;s academic quest were published this month in Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism, which includes a long section detailing the Korean experience. &quot;Illusory&quot; academic ideas about autism, he complains, both reflect and shape the contemporary South Korean child psychiatry scene. Blaming the mother In such a setting, reactive attachment disorder is a popular diagnosis, Grinker believes, because the condition simply blames the mother: &quot;That&apos;s the more culturally appropriate diagnosis, you see, because it means there&apos;s just this one person - the mother - who&apos;s to blame.&quot; Kyung-jin Cho, a South Korean anthropologist involved with the project, says the researchers&apos; initial screenings are interested in identifying symptoms, which will then be considered as part of a lengthy procedure based on the best scientific understanding about the malady. Young shin Kim, an assistant professor at Yale University&apos;s School of Medicine and the project&apos;s other principal investigator, complains about the &quot;shared ignorance&quot; about autism, in a country served by just 70 trained child psychiatrists. Along with her colleagues, Kim points out that it has only been the new, higher and more accurate prevalence rates that have, in Britain and America, produced more and better educational services, earlier diagnosis, better treatment, less social stigma; indeed, just about everything children with autism need. When a prevalence rate is finally generated for South Korea, this could be the case there, too. &quot;That&apos;s the reason we&apos;re doing the study,&quot; she says. &quot;Children with autism-spectrum disorders in Korea have every right to live their life and be happy, too. And their Korean mothers and fathers need to have every opportunity to overcome fear and discrimination.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/24/10", "sentences": ["The company has doubled capacity at an Alabama plant and is opening another in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-24T13:35:11Z", "title": "Sweetener sours profits at Tate & Lyle", "tags": ["Business", "Tate and Lyle", "Sugar"], "article": "Tate &amp; Lyle yesterday warned that profits this year would be lower than forecast after disappointing sales of its artificial sweetener Splenda in the US fizzy drinks market. Shares in the company, which supplies sugar, syrup and sweeteners, fell more than 15% on the announcement, closing at 608p. Chief executive Iain Ferguson said part of the problem was that Splenda, a trade name for sucralose, tasted too much like real sugar and that diet drink consumers had grown accustomed to the taste of the drinks already on the market. &quot;There is a very strong consumer acceptance, one might even say liking, for diet drinks as they are currently formulated,&quot; he said. &quot;So it is quite a complex area.&quot; The company said overall trading in its financial year to the end of March was comfortably ahead but that sales and profits of Splenda would only &quot;modestly&quot; exceed the previous year. Tate &amp; Lyle introduced Splenda four years ago and claims the sweetener is used in more than 4,000 products. &quot;We don&apos;t see any reduction in interest from our major customers but I think it is absolutely clear that there has been a slowdown,&quot; Mr Ferguson said. &quot;We are not getting the rate of uptake that we had hoped.&quot; He said, however, that he remained confident in the product. &quot;I think it is a time-shift issue rather than an absolute issue. I plead guilty to being too bullish in the speed of uptake but it is a strong product that has a very strong position and considerable growth still to come.&quot; In the year ending March 2006, Splenda had sales of \u00a3142m and profits of \u00a368m. In the first half of this year, Splenda had sales of \u00a373m and profits of \u00a333m. Mr Ferguson yesterday bought 16,428 shares in the company at 608.75p. Chief operating officer Stanley Musesengwa bought the same amount. The company also blamed the weakness of the dollar for the profit warning as half its profits were earned in the US. The warning was issued only a month after it had issued an upbeat trading statement. Tate &amp; Lyle has hit a number of stumbling blocks with Splenda. Diet 7Up, which had adopted the no-calorie sweetener, has reverted to Aspartame. General Mills pulled the Trix and Coco Puffs cereals using Splenda from shelves after poor sales. A separately branded version of Diet Coke using the sweetener has also been poorly received. Splenda is also in Pepsi One, a variant of its diet cola. Mr Ferguson said Tate &amp; Lyle had teams working closely with US soft drinks makers to come up with new formulas for the market. Citigroup cut its full-year group profit forecast from \u00a3345m to \u00a3330m. For 2008, it reduced its forecast from \u00a3430m to \u00a3361m. In a research note, the bank said the company&apos;s confidence was &quot;misplaced&quot; and said it was &quot;hard to see why&quot; Splenda sales would rise materially beyond this year. Tate &amp; Lyle has much invested in Splenda, which accounted for about one-fifth of group profits last year.

Make no mistake, they&apos;re all at it. Christian Slater is the voice of Panasonic. Queen Latifah shakes it for Pizza Hut. George Clooney does spots for Budweiser, and Julia Roberts for America Online, while Kevin Spacey shills for Honda and the Keifer/Donald Sutherland axis make their pocket money from Apple and Volvo, respectively. They could all say that they&apos;re following in the footsteps of Orson Welles, who lent his voice to (again, offshore) products such as Carlsberg lager and Domecq sherry. But somehow I don&apos;t see Christian and Latifah using their money to finance Chimes at Midnight or The Other Side of the Wind.

Sean Connery, acting as though his sporran contains only cobwebs, has lent his Caledonian tones to the anonymous but apparently cash-drunk computer-systems outfit Level Three Communications.

Gene Hackman lends his drill-sergeant bark to ads for Oppenheimer Funds while Robert Redford, that icon of soft-focus American liberalism, is content to shill for notorious union-buster and opportunistic bankruptcy-filer United Airlines.

(&quot;Yeah, I&apos;m a rebel,&quot; he told reporters at Sundance this week, to which the only reply is, &quot;Yeah, and I&apos;m Richard Nixon.&quot;) And Dennis Hopper manages to sell out in his own annoyingly inimitable way, pimping for AmeriPrise Financial retirement funds by betraying whatever principles Easy Rider might once have had embodied. One person who at least pays lip service to Hopper&apos;s 1960s ideals, no matter how degraded by compromise, is Law and Order star Sam Waterston. On the one hand he shakes his tootsie for another Wall Street firm (TB AmeriTrade), while on the other he salves his liberal conscience doing voiceovers in commercials for the venerable leftwing journal The Nation - probably for free. It&apos;s like the movie star&apos;s principle: one for the studio, one for me - except in Waterston&apos;s version, it&apos;s one for my beach house, one for my conscience. It seems as though American television has returned to the days when Ronald Reagan could step off the set, light up a Chesterfield and rave madly about its clean, healthy taste, or newsreaders would break off from describing the latest developments in Korea to inform us of the benefits of Downy fabric softener. There is no longer an impermeable membrane between a movie star&apos;s artistic integrity (OK, a laughable notion) and sordid commerce.

I am in a factory just outside Munich. My primary view out of the horribly stained window is of a series of more, extraordinarily ugly factories and a number of moustached employees. I feel engulfed by industrial fumes and a particularly pernicious brand of polyester. Yes, January can be a grim month. The magnificence of the new year holiday seems as distant as French Polynesia. But how magnificent it was. I smile at the memory of Bangkok and my splendidly alcoholic celebration at its futuristic Bed Supperclub. I wish I could have spent a few more days at the Sydney Cricket Ground. And I marvel at the efficiency of Singapore. Boring? Oh no (go to super-club Zouk). Relaxing? Oh yes (stay at The Fullerton). Wow. The memories have suddenly lifted my mood. As it happens, January hasn&apos;t been all that bad. Granted, the first business flight of the year \u2013 the deeply unprestigious BA948 to Munich \u2013 is an experience every well-worn business traveller dreads. And I&apos;ll accept that D\u00fcsseldorf isn&apos;t Sydney. And I&apos;ll reluctantly concede that my clients aren&apos;t called Elle or Sienna or Scarlett but Nigel and Kamelshitt and Gaiy. Yet I&apos;ve rather enjoyed the sense of warm familiarity that comes with being in Europe. My London cab driver cracks jokes I find funny (Knock Knock? Who&apos;s there? Europe? Europe who? No no, YOU&apos;RE a poo!). And my team has welcomed me back with open arms. There have been hugs and even a few awkward kisses. They&apos;ve worked hard; I&apos;ve worked hard. A real sense of stimulation and achievement: now you don&apos;t get that from downing Kamikaze, even in the most upmarket Thai bar. Last week concluded with more hard work. The slopes of Courchevel provided the setting for a gruelling examination of my mental and physical stamina. I didn&apos;t risk skiing \u2013 too risky, of course - but I did write one, very significant professional email and indulge in a spot of extreme clubbing. La Grange is a venue of some calibre: funky house, black sofas and astonishingly obese Russians scoffing Beluga. In fact, this diary is proving remarkably cathartic. The black clouds have almost completely lifted and I&apos;ve only written 372 words. January can be grim but it hasn&apos;t been at all. And the best thing: the flying (apologies in advance to those of you who regularly lose sleep over carbon emissions). I love flying for business or pleasure, I really do. But do you? I bet that some of you don&apos;t: the endless queues, fog, lukewarm coffee and BAA&apos;s cheese-grater seats can make the entire experience a tedious chore. But there is hope, I promise you. Here are my top tips for enjoyable flying on business: Get a frequent flyer cardYou&apos;ll get miles. You&apos;ll get freebies. And best of all, you always get lounge access. Otherwise, you and your laptop may be consigned to departure Gate 3, with its host of appalling metal seats. Choose your seat onlineWhy leave something so significant to chance? Choose an emergency exit seat or, even better, if you can, sit in 1A or 1C on a European flight, the upper deck in long-haul business class and 1A or 1K in long-haul first class. Trust me, I&apos;ve tested this out enough times. Never check in luggageUnless you really want to wait for hours as baggage handlers muster the energy to load your bags on to an unfailingly malfunctioning conveyor belt.  Never, ever fly economyDownsizing? Cutting costs? Don&apos;t be fooled, flying economy is a catastrophe. Fly business in Europe; and try to fly first for long haul. Carry an MP3 playerWhatever I suggest, frustrations are inevitable. So carry the best relaxant in the world: music. Fashion a playlist of your 10 favourite songs and shut it all out. Carry provisionsI would recommend Fisherman&apos;s Friend Lemon - a lozenge that presses all the right buttons. Happy travelling to you all. Speak in a fortnight.

In fact, Asians themselves encourage this temptation, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) openly aiming to become increasingly like the European Union. In trying to decipher Asia&apos;s diplomatic future, Europeans are confronted, so to speak, with an &quot;embarrassment of riches.&quot; Is Asia today replaying the balance of power games of late 19th century Europe, with China in the role of Germany? Or is South Asia, through the growth of ASEAN, poised to one day become the far eastern equivalent of the EU? These comparisons are not neutral, and one may detect in the analogy between China today and 19th century Germany an element of that guilty pleasure in others&apos; troubles that the Germans call &quot;Schadenfreude&quot;. Asia may be doing well economically now, according to this view, but just wait: rising nationalism, China&apos;s appetite for power, and the rest of Asia&apos;s desire to curb its ambitions will necessarily impede economic growth and restore the west&apos;s global primacy. But this scenario does not correspond to reality. China at the beginning of the 21st century is not Bismarck&apos;s newly unified Germany in the second half of the 19th century. The Chinese do not view themselves as a rising new power, but instead as Asia&apos;s traditional power, now experiencing a renaissance. China, they believe, is regaining the status and prestige that it enjoyed until the end of the 18th century. As a result, unlike Wilhelmine Germany, the Chinese are not in a hurry to prove how strong and powerful they have become. In strategic terms, China is not a revisionist power, but instead a &quot;satisfied,&quot; status-quo power. The only exception to this, of course, would be a declaration of independence from Taiwan, which the Chinese would consider a casus belli. To be sure, the Chinese are indeed rearming - and even entering the military space race - but they are doing so at a pace and to a proportion that reflects their new economic prosperity. China&apos;s fundamental priorities remain economic, reflecting its leaders&apos; belief that their regime&apos;s long-term survival presupposes the continuation of rapid growth. For that, they need access to energy, but they are not about to engage in military or even diplomatic adventures. Nor are they set to become a benevolent, altruistic power, ready to use their new strength and reputation to improve the stability of the international system. Chinese cynicism and spontaneous selfishness, however, is now tempered by what they perceive as growing recognition of their unique status. The combination of respect and interest they see in the way the world now views China can only reinforce their sense of confidence. So why should they take unnecessary risks? The resounding success of the Africa-China summit, which was attended by more African leaders than purely African gatherings; the diplomatic rapprochement between India and Japan; and the democratic alliance in the making between India, Japan, and Australia can only be interpreted as signs of China&apos;s newly regained position. Why would they jeopardise such real and symbolic gains with rash and untested moves? There is no Bismarck at the helm of Chinese diplomacy, but there is no impetuous Kaiser either: just relatively prudent and competent technocrats. In reality, what may threaten the stability of the region, and above all that of China, is not an excess of Chinese ambitions or a failure to democratise, but the Chinese regime&apos;s inability to establish the rule of law. In 1978, China&apos;s newly installed leader, Deng Xiaoping, viewed Singapore as living proof of the superiority of capitalism over communism. He remembered the impoverished backwater that Singapore was in the 1920&apos;s, and now he saw the gleaming city that free enterprise - together with Lee Kwan Yew&apos;s quasi-authoritarian leadership - had wrought. It was after visiting Singapore that Deng introduced &quot;special economic zones&quot; in southern China. But the rule of law, even Singapore-style, is far harder to implement than capitalism, and its absence represents the major obstacle to the establishment of an Asian community based on the EU model. Twenty years ago, one of the main obstacles to creating an Asian Union was Japan - Asia&apos;s most advanced and successful country, but one that did not feel Asian. Moreover, the rest of Asia resented the Japanese for revelling in this difference. That resentment remains, sustained in part by historical grievances, but the Japanese have now come to perceive themselves as Asians, helped by their realisation that the economic miracle that they initiated in the region has gone well beyond them. In Europe, transcending nationalism required not only two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century, but also the prevalence of democratic regimes. The rule of law is the equivalent for Asia today of what democracy was for Europe yesterday. Without its gradual imposition, an Asian Union could at best remain only a pale and hollow copy of its European model. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/jan/27/foodanddrink.shopping", "sentences": ["Many of the headline dishes that blazed a trail in E &amp; O and Eight Over Eight are tweaked but still present, while a broader pan-Asian remit takes in the likes of a Szechuan-style spicy bean curd and Singapore noodles."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-27T14:47:56Z", "title": "Food preview: Queans, Leamington Spa | XO London | Lumi\u00e8re, Cheltenham", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Travel", "Restaurants", "London holidays", "Culture", "Restaurants", "England holidays"], "article": "QueansLeamington Spa Starched white tablecloths and muted decor suggest stuffy fine dining, but this new venture proves anything but.

A dim sum dish of steamed bass has bite-size morsels wrapped in spinach; the buttery texture nicely spliced with sharp yuzu. Tempura of banana pepper stuffed with aubergine is an inventive, now crunchy, now soft variation that works well with dark jalapeno sauce. From the specials menu, Alaskan king crab sees the leg meat fired with white pepper and served in the shell: simple and very good.

Fuji Rock, Echigo Yuzawa, Japan Only two days into our trip, we escaped from Tokyo, jumped off the bullet train and headed for the hills. Our destination was the Fuji Rock festival, where we found ourselves in the company of 50,000 Japanese music lovers in the middle of a cloud-topped valley, with barely a dog-end, scrap of litter or westerner in sight. As an all-male, white group, we were mistaken for a band by many a Fujirocker - a situation we readily used to our advantage.

During the Vietnam war, American GIs would frequent Pho Binh, where, unbeknown to them, the owner and nationalist sympathiser Ngo Toai allowed Viet Cong meetings to be held in the room above the restaurant.  Pho Binh still functions as a noodle shop today, so we devoured a bowl of pork noodle soup while thumbing through numerous newspaper reports detailing the history of the place with photographs of recently returning US veterans. \u00b7 Pho Binh, 7 Ly Chinh Thang, HCMC.

Bussorah Street, Muslim Quarter, Singapore With only two nights in Singapore before flying to Australia, our choice of location was hurried - but proved to be one of the highlights of our trip. Bussorah Street is a microcosm of modern Singapore, with a combination of western, Chinese and Arab-Muslim culture all on one road. Sleepy Sam&apos;s (sleepysams.com) was our chosen base, complete with the largest dormitory we&apos;d ever seen (yet also the most private, thanks to drapes and partition walls), free breakfast, showroom showers and free wireless internet. Directly opposite is Grandfather&apos;s Collections, a goldmine of kitsch furniture, artefacts and nostalgic memorabilia, peddled by the proud and friendly owner, Mr Ting. He served us soft drinks from his old American fridge, mailed our postcards once we&apos;d written them and talked us through his press clippings from a range of international style magazines. At the end of Bussorah Street, at Samar&apos;s restaurant, we feasted on roast chicken, served on a gigantic tray of rice and helped down with ice tea. The Melbourne bar scene, Australia Bar-crawling in Melbourne led to some quirky discoveries. An outdoor bar dubbed Section 8 (27 Tattersalls Lane) had all the local geeks and freaks mustered around stacked pallets, while the bar took the shape of an old shipping container, and the DJ had his decks assembled on top of oil barrels. The Croft Institute (21-25 Croft Alley, thecroftinstitute.com.au) was an odd yet inspiring outlet, with vinyl flooring, science desks, wheelchairs and test tubes - seemingly raided from an old school&apos;s skip. We found Cherry (103 Flinders Lane) on a grimy backstreet, way too cool to have any kind of signage outside. It prefers to use the assembled line of gig-goers as its beacon. Once inside, there is a cute stage, finely tuned darkness, a jukebox and an enthusiastic crowd.  \u00b7 Follow Boyce and Crook&apos;s journey at phileasblog.net. benji.lanyado@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jan/27/booksonhealth.society", "sentences": ["James visits places in the grip of Affluenza, such as Australia and Singapore, and also places less affected."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-27T23:53:46Z", "title": "Review: Affluenza by Oliver James", "tags": ["Books", "Health, mind and body", "Culture", "Society"], "article": "Affluenza: How to Be Successful and Stay Sane by Oliver James  400pp, Vermillion, \u00a317.99 In his 1997 book Britain on the Couch, Oliver James asserted that &quot;advanced capitalism makes money out of misery and dissatisfaction, as if it were encouraging us to fill up the psychic void with material goods&quot;. In this book, he explores the idea further, and it&apos;s terrific. A lot of readers, wanting to put their finger on why the affluent world they live in makes them so uneasy, will want to cheer. Here he is saying, loud and clear, that capitalism is bad for your mental health. And then he tells us why this is the case, and what we can do about it. &quot;My focus,&quot; explains James, &quot;is on why we are so fucked up, not with dangling a false promise of the possibility of happiness.&quot; He&apos;s right - he doesn&apos;t offer false promises. By the time you&apos;ve finished this book, you, too, might be feeling pretty pessimistic. As if we weren&apos;t already - as James points out, almost a quarter of Britons suffer &quot;emotional distress&quot;. &quot;Cards on the table,&quot; he says, &quot;I contend that most emotional distress is best understood as a rational response to sick societies.&quot; So why are we, in James&apos;s words, so fucked up? It&apos;s because of what James calls Selfish Capitalism, or, more catchily, &quot;Affluenza&quot;, a virus-like condition that spreads through affluent countries. In these countries, notably English-speaking ones, people define themselves by how much money they make. They are also ruled by superficial values - how attractive they look, how famous they are, how much they are able to show off. As the sociologist Erich Fromm would have put it, we have moved from a state of &quot;being&quot; to a state of &quot;having&quot;. Now we are obsessed with what other people think of us, and we&apos;ve lost touch with our own feelings. How has this happened? James is very coherent on this matter. He explains the thesis behind Vance Packard&apos;s famous book on advertising, The Hidden Persuaders: in a society in which people all have what they need, the job of advertisers is to create false needs. Packard wrote his book in the 1950s, and what James is exploring is the fallout from 60 years of false needs. The fallout, of course, gets worse; each successive generation is more anxious and depressed. In the past, people wanted things because they were useful; later, they wanted them to enhance their status; and now they want them because they feel ugly and alone. It&apos;s a wonderfully clear and cogent thesis. Affluenza, as defined by James, is clearly recognisable as our way of life. It spreads because it feeds on itself; when you try to make yourself feel better by buying a car, or bulking up in the gym, or spraying on a fake tan, or having a facelift, you actually make yourself feel worse, which makes you want to buy more things. As James points out, the virus has spread to television - &quot;most programmes,&quot; he says, &quot;are now barely concealed advertisements for classes of product&quot; - and education. James sees modern education as &quot;little better than a systematic method for spreading the virus&quot;. He travels the world, interviewing rich, unhappy people. There is Sam, a New York billionaire who lives alone in a vast apartment. Sam was addicted to heroin, and now seems to be addicted to casual sex with young girls. He has, we are shown, pursued the goals of affluenza to their ultimate point. He can have anything he wants, but nothing satisfies him. James also meets the trophy wife of another fabulously rich man - she is addicted to shopping and cocaine, and he is often away from home. Their relationship is based on mutual contempt: she spends his money with vengeful spite; he pays her back with coldness and abuse. James visits places in the grip of Affluenza, such as Australia and Singapore, and also places less affected. People are more depressed, he tells us, where inequality is greatest. So Denmark, with its high taxes, is hanging in there; Danes are less impressed by wealth and glamour than just about anyone else in the developed world. Heartbreakingly, he visits societies where the virus is taking hold, and shows us things that are about to die out. Russian women, he says, dress with individuality and a type of flair missing from the west, where they tend to follow the intricacies of fashion, and feel terrible about themselves. And people in Shanghai apparently feel less social anxiety, because, even though western values are sweeping the place, they still have their roots in an earlier era. Well, he&apos;s convinced me. The antidote is simple: look inward, not outward. Don&apos;t be a sheep. Try to be &quot;beautiful&quot; rather than &quot;attractive&quot;. Embrace the family. Don&apos;t see life as a competition. Don&apos;t watch too much TV. Simple, perhaps. But will it be enough? One of the scariest parts of the book is James&apos;s analysis of New Labour politicians. Have they been infected with the virus? Well, just think of Tony Blair and his property dealings, his flash holidays, his spray-on tan. Think of Peter Mandelson, who said: &quot;We are seriously relaxed about people becoming very, very rich.&quot; Think of Prescott. Think of Cherie Blair ... &quot;Just as Aids is stalking the globe, so is the Affluenza virus,&quot; says James. I think he&apos;s right.

After the initial mixture of curiosity and disbelief, the nature of the challenge is remarkably divisive, swiftly splitting people into one of two camps.  Friends either sigh and look at me as a slightly cranky little eco-fundamentalist whose hairshirt, yogurt-weaving notions of green self-sacrifice have led to this daftly complicated and rather inconvenient world mission. Or people&apos;s eyes light up at the prospect of a real adventure, of travelling away from the crowd at a different pace and in a very different style. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not an anti-flying fanatic.  I&apos;ve taken more than my fair share of international flights in my time, working in Jamaica, Australia and the South Pacific as a marine biologist. Maybe this latent carbon guilt has contributed to my decision to undertake this particular journey.  However four years ago I took my last holiday flight to visit friends in Malaga in southern Spain. The work I had been doing on climate change with my company Futerra had convinced me that it was increasingly difficult to justify the environmental impacts of flying purely to indulge myself.  I still visit Malaga, but, thanks to sterling advice from guru Mark Smith, it&apos;s a picturesque and relaxing train journey that takes in France, the Madrid plateau and a spectacular route through the Sierra Nevada mountains - a world apart from the cattle-truck mentality no-frills budget airline services of the Sleazyjet sector. It was this experience and subsequent rail trips to Warsaw and Barcelona that cemented the notion in my mind that travelling without flying really was a more attractive option, and not just environmentally.  You travel through a landscape, not just over it, and see first-hand the transition of scenery, culture, language and people that flying robs you of when it dumps you dazed and disoriented on the other side of the world.  So is it really, in the words of our prime minister, &quot;impractical&quot; to expect people not to fly?  Obviously, I believe the answer is no, and I&apos;m putting my time and money where my mouth is to celebrate the joy of slow, low-carbon travel.

In Singapore we&apos;ll catch a container ship to Australia. Then it&apos;s over the Nullarbor plain to Sydney and a blagged yacht passage to New Zealand, a brisk tramp through the mountains and another cargo ship from Tauranga to Los Angeles.

The economic benefits of the trade are enormous - and arguably contributed to China&apos;s near-miraculous economic growth over the last decade or so. For obvious reasons, it is difficult to get reliable statistics. But there are some revealing anecdotes. Last year, I was having dinner with several Western businessmen at the Great Hall of the People and they were comparing notes on the cultural and physical particularities of &quot;xiaojie&quot; (ladies) from different parts of China. One of them - a leading entrepreneur in the clothing industry - said, half-jokingly, if he&apos;s given the choice to invest and do business in China or an Islamic country like Bangladesh, where do you think he&apos;d want to go? In Beijing, there are karaoke parlors - the singing often followed by paid sex - specifically tailored for visiting businessmen of various nationalities. One club frequented by Koreans has Korean-speaking hostesses largely drawn from China&apos;s Korean minority. The same club has a floor with Japanese-speaking hostesses for Japanese businessmen. The government&apos;s periodic crackdowns on the trade only serve to confirm its economic importance. The economist Yang Fan estimates that with the implementation of the Regulations on the Management of Places of Entertainment, issued by the State Council in 1999, the Chinese GDP dropped by 1%. Taiyuan, the capital city of Shanxi province, was known as China&apos;s Karoake Capital, with about 7000 clubs in the city. In 1996, the government decided to crackdown. As a result, the restaurant and hotel business nosedived and the &quot;xiaojie withdrew 400m RMB of remittances from the local banks. The government reversed course one month later. During important government meetings, karaoke parlors in Beijing are told to expect police inspections. But the dates are carefully specified in advance, with the implication that things will soon revert to normal. Public attitudes are also changing. In early December, the police officers in Shenzhen publicly paraded about 100 women and their johns in an attempt to humiliate them and discourage the trade - or perhaps to punish them for not paying their dues to the powers-that-be. The tactic led to a swift outcry in newspapers and on the internet, with the police coming under a hail of criticism for violating the right to privacy of those who were paraded in public. Elsewhere, public authorities are taking active measures to deal with the health consequences of the sex trade. In Harbin, sex workers are given courses in AIDS education and the use of condoms. To reduce the risk of sexually-transmitted diseases, every hotel room in Yunnan comes equipped with condoms. There have also been national voices calling for legalization. In the 2006 annual meeting of the National People&apos;s Congress, one deputy from Heilongjiang called for legalization of prostitution in order to secure the health of workers and reduce the risks of sexually-transmitted diseases. In private discussion, many intellectuals seem to endorse such views. In sum, the gap between public morality and the social reality may not be as wide as the government may fear. To the extent there is any resistance, the benefits of Singapore-style legalization will far outweigh the costs. Sex workers and their customers would be protected from sexually-transmitted diseases. The trade could be taxed and the revenue could be used for the disadvantaged (as it happens, &quot;xiaojie&quot; often send remittances to support family members in the impoverished countryside). The costs of prostitution would go down, to the benefit of the tens of millions of sexually-frustrated migrant workers. And the sex business would be taken out of the hands of criminal elements."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/29/highereducation.uk", "sentences": ["The London Business School maintains its ranking as fifth, but the French school Insead, which now has an offshoot in Singapore, is the only other European school to make it into the top 10."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-29T11:48:00Z", "title": "US business schools top world rankings", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news", "Business", "MBAs", "Postgraduates"], "article": "American business schools continue to dominate the Financial Times league table published today.

The embarrassing fiasco over Suvarnabhumi - which means &quot;golden land&quot; - was forced on Thailand&apos;s transport ministry after more than 100 cracks appeared in the runways and taxiways due to subsidence thought to be the result of poor drainage and shoddy materials. The \u00a32.2bn airport that was more than 40 years in the planning was built on drained land known as Cobra Swamp and opened amid great fanfare last September, just days after prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a bloodless military coup. Mr Thaksin had put his personal stamp on the mammoth project that boasts the world&apos;s tallest control tower and second biggest building and hoped it would reflect his soaring ambition. But the airport, designed to cater for 45 million passengers annually, was mired in corruption allegations that critics contend explain its disastrous shortcomings. Next week the transport minister, Theera Haocharoen, is to ask the military-appointed cabinet to agree to transfer some flights to the mothballed Don Muang airport for up to six months while the repairs at Suvarnabhumi are carried out. Domestic operators with no connections for international flights are to be offered the opportunity to return to the old airport in Bangkok&apos;s northern suburbs in an effort to reduce Suvarnabhumi&apos;s traffic by almost a third. Thailand&apos;s interim government ordered an investigation into the scale of the problems after a number of flights were last week diverted to an old American B52 base at U-Tapao, south of Bangkok. The four passenger jets ran short of fuel while circling because of delays from repair work already underway at Suvarnabhumi.

An opinion poll found that 16.4% believed the airport unsafe, while 48% were convinced corruption lay at the root of the steel-and-glass complex&apos;s troubles that surfaced within hours of the official opening. Inadequate baggage handling equipment immediately led to long delays and lost belongings. Since then, the complaints have steadily mounted: lifts failed to work, toilets were insufficient to meet passenger needs, female flight attendants were sexually harassed by construction workers, and last weekend a major water leak in a toilet destroyed passenger baggage. The latest difficulties surrounding the cracks to the taxiways in 25 different areas have put 11 of the airport&apos;s 51 air-bridges out of commission and severely curtailed the complex&apos;s handling capacity, forcing the airport authority&apos;s move back to the creaking old Don Muang site."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/30/educationguardian2.educationguardian", "sentences": ["There are now around 35,000 students enrolled in 180 countries (St Helena in the South Atlantic has two, Singapore around 3,000)."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-30T23:47:10Z", "title": "Crib sheet", "tags": ["Education"], "article": "Notes from abroad More than a century before the Open University was a gleam in the eye of Harold Wilson and his junior education minister, Jennie Lee, the youthful London University was offering degrees to those who could not or would not travel to the capital for their studies. A Royal charter in April 1858 opened the way for candidates at provincial centres around England to take matriculation papers, proving they were of the desired standard to take the degrees. Soon they were sitting degree exams at such centres, too. Sir Graeme Davies, the university&apos;s vice-chancellor, delights in pointing out to universities such as Nottingham, Hull, Exeter and Keele that this is how they were born - as outposts of a fledgling movement that coincided with reforms of the postal system and the spread of railways. &quot;You have to remind them we looked after them until they grew up,&quot; he jokes. Soon people were setting up correspondence colleges and private tuition to satisfy the thirst for education. The shoemaker in his garret could also pursue an education on his own. &quot;We did not ever require that you had formal instruction. You could instruct yourself. The only formal requirement of students is that they register, pay fees and sit the examinations,&quot; says Davies. &quot;The quality control system is delightfully simple. People who are setting the banking exam in the London School of Economics for internal students set the exam for those who are external and mark it. The papers are different, but the standards the same.&quot; The university quickly developed an imperial reach, too, with examining centres abroad. Mauritius was first to get papers entrusted to the custody of its governor. Among the programme&apos;s more famous students was Nelson Mandela, although he never completed his degree during his imprisonment on Robben Island. An honorary law degree came later. Prisoners of war were also eager students. More notoriously, Robert Mugabe holds four external degrees obtained through private study. There are now around 35,000 students enrolled in 180 countries (St Helena in the South Atlantic has two, Singapore around 3,000). The programme has an an annual income of \u00a320m from fees, which average around \u00a33,000 for six years&apos; hard studying. A history of the external programme, as yet untitled, is being written by Christine Kenyon Jones, a research fellow in the department of English at King&apos;s College, London.James Meikle Everybody&apos;s doing it At 41, Nick Hamlyn had a \u00a3150,000-a-year job as a City banker, a West End bachelor pad and a \u00a330,000 sports car. But what he didn&apos;t have was a life. &quot;I spent my time going out with clients and speaking to them on the phone. The rest of the time I was recovering from going out with clients and speaking to them on the phone,&quot; he says. That year, three years ago, Hamlyn quit his job to train as a secondary school French teacher - as did 13,557 others aged between 30 and 49. Hamlyn traded his Audi TT for a Volkswagen Polo, his Zone 1 home for something a little more suburban and a salary of \u00a333,208 at Mill Hill county high school in north London. &quot;It was tough financially,&quot; he says. &quot;I would never have been able to go back to being a student on \u00a36,000 a year if my partner, Helen, hadn&apos;t been there to support me financially. But my two careers are incomparable. I am not saying I don&apos;t have bad days as a teacher, but my job is fundamentally satisfying. I think what I enjoy most is fascinating 25 people simultaneously. I just love it when one of them says, &apos;I really understand that now, sir&apos;.&quot; Teaching is the top choice for graduates up to the age of 36 who are planning a career change, research published this week by the Training and Development Agency shows. Up to 20% consider the profession, while 14% contemplate the media industry and 10% banking. A fifth of newly qualified teachers have left a management role in another profession and a sixth have held middle-management positions. Of the 893 new teachers polled, 79% said they were attracted to teaching because they wanted to make a difference to people&apos;s lives, and 78% said they wanted to work with young people. Most of those who swap their careers to become teachers are aged between 30 and 49. In 2004-05, 15,089 in this age bracket did so, compared with 6,762 in 1998-99. And the profession attracted 823 people aged 50 or over in 2004-05, compared with 240 in this age bracket in 1998-99. &quot;If you had told me so many people swapped their careers for teaching when I was enrolling on my teacher training course, I would have been very surprised,&quot; says Hamlyn. &quot;It seemed such a difficult thing to do.

An initial screening for literacy and numeracy should be carried out for all full-time students - adult and teenage - enrolling on college courses, the inspectorate recommends. And colleges should make sure that all students who are offered help with these basic skills take it up, Ofsted urges in a new report on its survey of the support available in further education. The situation for students with poor basic skills has improved since Ofsted last looked at literacy and numeracy in colleges, in 2003. &quot;The stigma that used to be attached to receiving learning support had largely gone,&quot; the report notes. But the problem is big. Many adult students - and indeed many in the 16 to 19 age group - need extra numeracy, literacy and language support if they are going to achieve their best on their courses. But there is still a serious shortage of specialist support teachers, as was noted in 2003. Qualifications gained at school are not necessarily enough to go on. &quot;Assessment was weak in a small number of the sixth-form colleges because it relied too narrowly on English and mathematics results at GCSE level,&quot; says Ofsted. Though most colleges are good at assessing new students, many are not so good at giving students learning plans with clear targets that are monitored. Colleges with good support systems see fewer students drop out. In all but one of the 29 colleges investigated by Ofsted, retention rates among students getting support were better than among those who didn&apos;t need support. And in nine of these colleges, pass rates for students getting support were better than for the rest. In the best examples, subject teachers and support tutors plan lessons together, and each has a good awareness of the other&apos;s role. In the very best examples, college principals and senior managers get involved in developing support, the report notes. At the other end of the spectrum, help was less effective &quot;when the support tutor acted mainly as a classroom assistant, handing out worksheets or clearing up art materials&quot;.Peter Kingston"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/31/travelnews.bangkok", "sentences": ["Bangkok&apos;s new international airport, which opened four months ago amid hopes that it would rival Singapore and Kuala Lumpur as a regional hub, is to be partially shut for urgent repairs."], "publicationDate": "2007-01-31T00:22:13Z", "title": "Cracks in runways partly close new Bangkok airport", "tags": ["World news", "Travel", "Bangkok holidays", "Thailand holidays", "Malaysia"], "article": "Bangkok&apos;s new international airport, which opened four months ago amid hopes that it would rival Singapore and Kuala Lumpur as a regional hub, is to be partially shut for urgent repairs.

Back in 1086, it was observed that in England and Wales &quot;there was no single hide nor a yard of land, nor indeed one ox nor one pig which was left out&quot;. The Treasury did not claim such blanket coverage for yesterday&apos;s 2007 National Assets Register (NAR) - which only specifies items worth \u00a31m or more - but it did put a value on everything the state owns and came up with a total of \u00a3337,104,120,000 (almost \u00a3338bn). And whereas the original Norman Domesday Book (which valued William&apos;s realm at just \u00a373,000) detailed every plough and fish pond, Mr Brown&apos;s audit includes the Diana Memorial Fountain (\u00a34m), the 23 photographs by Alfred Steilglitz in the Victoria and Albert Museum (\u00a31.8m), the Redgrave and Pinsent rowing centre at Caversham (\u00a310m) and the Armagh Observatory, which at barely \u00a31m only just warrants an individual entry. The new NAR is not Mr Brown&apos;s first attempt at winkling out from Whitehall the value of its assets. In 1997, the newly appointed Labour chancellor said he wanted to know how much the state was worth, and discovered that the list included 48 castles, 27 houses in Ottawa, 28 rabies vans and the car park at Ipswich Town football club&apos;s Portman Road stadium. Inflation means the Treasury thinks it no longer worth specifying individual assets valued at less than \u00a31m, which means the non-appearance of some of the national treasures included in New Labour&apos;s first update of the Domesday book 10 years ago - such as the apple tree under which Isaac Newton was sitting when he allegedly came up with the laws of gravity. Indeed, the twin impact of rising property prices and Labour&apos;s expansion of the public sector means that the state&apos;s assets are now worth almost three times as much as the estimated \u00a3125bn-plus in 1997. As a result, the Treasury sees the NAR as more than an inventory of the curiosities owned by Whitehall; its publication is designed to allow Mr Brown to draw up a hitlist of \u00a330bn of assets that he wants sold off over the next three years to plug the gap in the public finances. Stephen Timms, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: &quot;The NAR is an important tool for the 2007 comprehensive spending review, which seeks to capitalise on 10 years of high investment by improving asset management practices throughout the public sector. &quot;The 2007 NAR will encourage departments to make the best possible use of their existing asset base by exploiting under-utilised assets and disposing of assets no longer required for service delivery,&quot; he added. More than half the state&apos;s assets are owned by the two great baronies of Whitehall - the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Transport - while paupers such as the Office of Attorney General and Hilary Benn&apos;s Department for International Development between them have assets barely worth more than the Bank of England&apos;s base in Threadneedle Street. Excluding the gold in the vaults, Mervyn King, the Bank&apos;s governor, is presiding over a building worth just shy of \u00a3140m. In meticulous detail over 40 pages, the Department for Transport puts a value on motorway service stations (Toddington on the M1, \u00a35.6m, Burtonwood on the M62 a snip at \u00a31.5m). The Ministry of Defence takes 61 pages to list every barracks, mess, hangar, warship, helicopter and truck owned by the armed forces. Anybody prepared to wade through the 1,100 pages of the NAR - William the Conqueror&apos;s two-volume original came in at well under 1,000 - can find that the 40 Chinook helicopters are valued at \u00a3389m and four hovercraft at just over \u00a31m. The original Domesday Book, the UK&apos;s oldest surviving national record, was written on sheep-skin parchment using black and red ink only; yesterday&apos;s modern variant is available online or in hard copy form at \u00a3120. According to the Treasury, Labour&apos;s value-for-money approach has led to the disposal of unwanted assets in recent years. It boasts that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - which was targeted by Mr Brown for the opulence of embassies and residencies abroad - has sold assets worth more than \u00a3220m between 2000 and 2005, including prime real estate in Singapore valued at \u00a328m. What the Treasury omitted to mention in its press release, however, was that the FCO acquired assets worth \u00a3516m over the same period. Similarly, the MoD has sold off \u00a32bn of surplus assets since 2000, including the Duke of York barracks in Chelsea, RAF Burtonwood, Oakington barracks and a number of &quot;major&quot; sites in London. Over the same period it has acquired assets worth 16 times as much, according to the NAR. Some of the valuations might also raise an eyebrow or two.

Hire Liverpool FC to defend it. Because the uppity Anfield outfit appear to have a unique ability to twist the long arm of the law. Last season they pestered Uefa into giving them a Big Cup berth they weren&apos;t entitled to and today their incessant whining has forced Fifa into letting them sign Javier Mascherano, despite the rules clearly stating that no player can play for more than two clubs in a single season. Mascherano has already turned out for Corinthians and West Ham this term but Fifa has, for the first time ever, agreed to waive the rule. &quot;Particular emphasis was given to safeguarding sporting integrity and the crucial element of overlapping sports seasons between associations, notably in cases in which a sports season starts prior to, and ends beyond, July 1,&quot; explained a Fifa flunkey, possibly after expressing his relief at finally being able to remove the industrial strength earplugs he felt compelled to buy earlier this month. What Fifa didn&apos;t explain, of course, is why a club that employs Xabi Alonso and Momo Sissoko think they need a central midfielder who is below Nigel Quashie and Hayden Mullins in the West Ham order of merit. Is Rafa Benitez trying to suggest Alan Curbishley doesn&apos;t know a top player when he sees one? If so, the Spaniard surely nodded knowingly this afternoon when he heard that, having already had two bids rejected, the Hammers&apos; head had submitted an \u00a38m offer for Matthew Upson.

I clattered him. I took him, the ball, everything. When he came to Newcastle, he could not speak a word of English and he was being introduced to everybody by an interpreter. When he got to me, he said something to the interpreter and when I asked him what he had said, he said: &apos;You are a dirty Irish b@stard! That was fair enough. We got on really well after that&quot; - former Magpies defender and now RTE pundit John Anderson recalls doing his bit for Irish-Brazilian relations. ********************* BIND THE GAP With the possible exception of those zesty post-PE showers, the Fiver&apos;s happiest moments at school always came when the teacher had to leave class for an unspecified period. You could have all sorts of fun: inflict a sickening wedgie on old Mickey Robinson; write TAWT DLAB backwards on Sir Slaphead&apos;s blackboard; or even compare the range of your man-ruler with a few peers. Whatever: the point was that you had to take advantage before the teacher came back. Just ask Lord Ferg, because the teacher in the case of this scandalously tenuous intro is John Terry, and he&apos;ll be back to restore order to the title race any day now. We don&apos;t know exactly when that will be - he misses tonight&apos;s game at home to The Artists Formerly Known As Blackeye Rovers with calf trouble - but so far the MU Rowdies have failed to make the most of his absence. When Terry walked off the field after Chelsea&apos;s 1-0 win over Newcastle on December 13, the Rowdies were five points clear. Seven games and one full-blown Chelsea crisis later, they are only six clear. Chelsea&apos;s woes may have subconsciously lulled an increasingly slapdash Rowdies into a false sense of security. &quot;We cannot afford to rely on [a six-point lead] and we must not be satisfied,&quot; said their assistant manager Carlos Queirozeyefora4-5-1athometoWatford, breaking the habit of a lifetime by speaking sense. &quot;We want more and we need more.&quot; Damn straight. When Terry returns to bind the gap, Chelsea will surely go on one of their will-to-live-sapping winning runs, so tonight could be the Rowdies&apos; last chance to extend the lead. Not even Ferg could tinker his side out of a home win over Watford, whereas a Terry-less Chelsea should be given a real test by Mark Hughes&apos;s admirable TAFKABR, even with Claude Makelele returning. Squeaky-bum time is coming, and Ferg might be left to regret not inflicting those wedgies on West Ham, Newcastle and Arsenal while Mr Terry was away. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Teddy Sheringham, 128, will become a Spurs player if he can hobble his way from Upton Park to White Hart Lane before the transfer window closes.

The Olympic board, the four-strong body she is a member of that is charged with overall control of 2012 matters, will meet on Wednesday to discuss plans for the stadium and is expected to conclude that all the talk about a Premiership side becoming an anchor tenant has come to nothing. Discussions took place two months ago between Jowell and the Icelandic consortium which has taken over West Ham United, but the process has been inconclusive. Jowell said yesterday it was a &quot;fair conclusion&quot; that the Stratford stadium would not become home to a football club because of the tight building timescale. Team McAlpine, the consortium which built Arsenal&apos;s Emirates ground, needs to produce detailed plans for the stadium that will be the showcase venue in the Olympic Park. Jowell said: &quot;We want to see the earthmovers and diggers move on to the site to begin work in July next year.&quot; There had been intense debate within the government over securing a Premiership team to help recoup some of the \u00a3300m likely to be spent on the stadium. Richard Caborn, the sports minister, was keen to see a similar deal to that secured after the Commonwealth Games when Manchester City took over as tenants at the City of Manchester Stadium. But the issue has always been complicated by a pledge that London 2012 made to the International Olympic Committee that the stadium would retain an athletics and community use after the Games - with a plan to reduce the capacity from 80,000 to around 25,000. The retention of a permanent running track was unattractive to West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur, who also briefly showed an interest in the stadium. Discussions centred on using retractable seating to cover the track, which has been successfully done at the Stade de France, in Paris, and at Stadium Australia in Sydney, but there were fears this could cause costs to further escalate. Eggert Magnusson, West Ham&apos;s chairman, may now examine other options, including redeveloping the club&apos;s Upton Park stadium, or finding another site in London&apos;s East End. Jowell and other Olympic board members - Lord Coe, Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, and Lord Moynihan, chairman of the British Olympic Association - are expected to finalise specifications for the stadium next week. After that point design changes could prove prohibitively expensive, as the Football Association&apos;s experiences with the Wembley fiasco illustrated. Jowell yesterday refused to set a deadline for the completion of the revised budget for building the Olympic Park, which currently stands at \u00a34.3bn, including some regeneration work. Lord Coe, the chairman of London 2012, said: &quot;We have been committed since before Singapore to a track and field legacy for the stadium.&quot; He stressed the importance of ensuring there was genuine community access after 2012. The Olympic Delivery Authority&apos;s budget for 2007-08 will be published in March, but the global budget could take longer to finalise. Jowell told the Legacy Lives conference, in central London, that the greatest legacy from the Games would be the &quot;scale of social transformation&quot; - notably the Games&apos; inspirational effect on children and the regeneration of five of London&apos;s most deprived boroughs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/feb/02/horseracing.gdnsport3", "sentences": ["That&apos;s where we come in to challenge the status quo and do it with something novel, that can have an adverse reaction in some people&apos;s minds.&quot; New Zealand, Singapore, India and America - where Betfair has carefully avoided any involvement until now - are among the markets considered as ripe for the exchange revolution."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-02T02:12:32Z", "title": "Horse Racing: Nichols hits back at critics", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;I sometimes feel I should be putting a suit on for work,&quot; Greg Nichols says, as he wanders through Betfair&apos;s dress-down, open-plan offices next to the Thames in Hammersmith in jumper and cords. Apart from that, though, he seems to have adapted to his new life rather well. Through four turbulent years as the chief executive of the British Horseracing Board, he was never one to carry his cares too obviously. Now, though, there is a bouncy air about him again that was there when he arrived at the BHB, but generally missing in action by the time he left. The result is that it does not seem quite as strange as it might have done to find him sitting next to the chief executive at Betfair HQ. This, after all, is the man who once told the BHB&apos;s AGM, in regard to potential integrity issues, that &quot;the scale of this threat is unprecedented&quot;. For some at the BHB, his choice of new employer was baffling, to say the least. Nichols, however, does not see a contradiction, though he admits to &quot;disappointment&quot; that he was recently barred from addressing an international racing conference in Dubai when a number of delegates objected to his Betfair links. &quot;I don&apos;t think I was ever strident or antagonistic about exchanges,&quot; he says. &quot;From early on, the argument for me wasn&apos;t about integrity, I think that&apos;s a very shallow argument for rejecting exchanges. For me it was about revenue for racing, and that wasn&apos;t just discrete to betting exchanges. I wanted more money from bookmakers too. &quot;I thought for a while before accepting the job here, but that was nothing to do with any worries about what people might think. I know that I always gave 110% at the BHB and I believed in what I did, and I was proud of what I did. &quot;I could have gone back to Australia, but with all due respect to Australian racing, British racing is the pinnacle and they can&apos;t come within lengths of what we come up to in this country.&quot; Nichols&apos; new job - as Betfair&apos;s managing director (sporting affairs) - casts him as something of a missionary for the exchange, using the contacts and experience of two decades in racing administration to open up new markets. His Dubai experience showed the sort of resistance he may encounter, but he seems confident that the momentum is with him. &quot;People are averse to change, so we need to persuade them that this is not the devil incarnate, and that exchanges will drive revenue and more importantly bring new people to the product. Countries that use a betting model based on a pari-mutuel and high takeout rate are neglecting what the customer wants. That&apos;s where we come in to challenge the status quo and do it with something novel, that can have an adverse reaction in some people&apos;s minds.&quot; New Zealand, Singapore, India and America - where Betfair has carefully avoided any involvement until now - are among the markets considered as ripe for the exchange revolution. &quot;The States would be the pinnacle because of the immense wealth,&quot; Nichols says. &quot;America is a market that&apos;s there, you just have to build the right partnerships with people and we&apos;re doing that at the moment. Whether we break in or not in the next six or 12 months will depend a bit on luck and a lot on strategy, and we&apos;re working on that.&quot; If there are any pangs about leaving the BHB, Nichols keeps them well hidden. &quot;One of the big differences working here is that you don&apos;t have to be a diplomat and a politician all the time,&quot; he says. &quot;Results are judged on a financial basis, and no idea is ever ridiculed. &quot;When you presented an idea to the BHB board, people would ask, does this suit my constituency, when they should have been asking, is it to the benefit of horse racing? Here, there are no egos. People have differences of opinion, but at the end of the day, there&apos;s no rancour. &quot;I think that the British Horseracing Authority [which will replace the BHB later this year] will be a success, and I&apos;ve got immense respect for Nic Coward [who will take on the Nichols role of chief executive]. A lot of people go through life and give up something, and then someone else comes in and they think, &apos;I hope the bastard fails&apos;. That&apos;s just so destructive. Personally, I love racing, and I want it to succeed.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/feb/02/thetenyoucouldntdowithout", "sentences": ["If you could only pick 10 ... a visitor in Singapore library."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-02T07:30:00Z", "title": "Vital statistics from World Book Day", "tags": ["Festivals", "Books", "Culture", "World Book Day"], "article": "If you could only pick 10 ... a visitor in Singapore library.

We were talking in early 2005, a time when the culture of lies was so all-enveloping that even those who questioned it seemed to be somehow imprisoned inside its terms of reference: &quot;The aims of the occupation may be admirable ... but is it working?&quot; Watching the news, I longed for Mossman&apos;s ghost to appear on screen. His gift had always been to examine untruth without the slightest hint of fellow feeling for it. I first saw him on television in the early 1960s. Viewers in those days had the choice of a mere two television channels, and Panorama regularly went out to an audience of 10 million. Mossman was handsome, rangy and brilliant. Weaving his way through a Hong Kong riot, chatting with Yemeni warlords or on the trail with a company of US marines in Vietnam, he seemed partly reporter, partly some dazzlingly gifted proconsul sorting out a troublesome outpost of the empire. Around this time, when I was working in a bookshop, he appeared at the counter and asked, with a kind of searching diffidence, if we had a copy of James Michie&apos;s translation of Horace&apos;s Odes. (We didn&apos;t.) A little later I used to pass him in the corridors of the BBC, where I was working as a floor assistant: this was basically the job of call-boy, assigned at random to whatever programme came up on the rota - Fanny Cradock or Jackanory, or a Ken Loach drama. An adrenalin-packed day meant Ned Sherrin&apos;s late-night satire programme, in which the running order was quite often thrown up in the air while the show was going out live. Mossman was an occasional guest on Ned&apos;s panel discussions: an intense, incisive figure standing out starkly among the professional humorists. I saw him just once after this, early one evening in the Opera Tavern, off Drury Lane. He was with his lover Louis, whom I had known some years before. It was the night of the American-inspired coup that toppled the Diem regime in South Vietnam. Overawed, I made a stupid remark about it. Mossman was angry about the day&apos;s events and clearly thought I was an idiot. But he took the trouble to put me straight. I&apos;ve reconstructed some of what he said, as well as I can remember it, in my new play The Reporter. Once, when I was floor assisting on either Panorama or its rival programme Tonight, Richard Dimbleby, the nation&apos;s senior broadcaster, who was scheduled to anchor the programme, was unexpectedly absent. There were whispered conversations among the studio top brass and an air of drama. Robin Day arrived amid much self-generated fuss and stood in as anchor. The floor manager, Joan Marsden - one of those forceful, loyal BBC people who gave a heart to the corporation - was visibly upset, but took care to conceal what she knew. This scene came back to me vividly 40 years later. So did the studio interview with Harold Wilson, which by chance I saw live on air, that first sent Mossman&apos;s television career spinning off track. It angered even Hugh Carleton Greene, the BBC&apos;s famously liberal director- general. Mossman &quot;had shown too much personal emotion&quot;, he stated at the next news and current affairs meeting. &quot;He had not been justified in appearing personally involved.&quot; In a later interview with Commonwealth leaders, Mossman focused harshly on the prime minister of Singapore&apos;s habit of throwing his political opponents into prison. Greene circulated a furious memo: &quot;Mossman&apos;s handling of the discussion last night was absolutely deplorable ... He was opinionated and rude ... Has the time come when we should decide once and for all that Mossman should not be used any more in roles to which he is unsuited?&quot; The management discussions that followed are portrayed in the minutes, in normal BBC fashion, as taking place entirely between acronyms, albeit ones with quite distinct personalities. HCAG Tel defended Mossman stoutly, pointing out that most of the Commonwealth ministers concerned &quot;had stayed on afterwards in the best of humour&quot;. ENCA tried an even-handed approach: &quot;Mossman&apos;s frustration at receiving evasive replies to his questions was understandable, but his tone had been wrong.&quot; But MD Tel was taking no prisoners: &quot;Mossman&apos;s offensiveness, on this as on previous occasions, had stemmed from his self-righteousness.&quot; He was &quot;impervious to ordinary reprimands, and the point could best be made by ... declining to use him as interviewer/chairman unless absolutely necessary&quot;. HCAG Tel counter-attacked with the ingenious argument that &quot;excluding him from interviews and discussions would make his other services proportionally more expensive&quot;. But for D-G Designate (the future director-general, Greene being on his way out) decorum came first. It was, he judged, &quot;unfair to the BBC and to Mossman to put him in a role for which he was not fitted, even if the cost of not doing so was high&quot;. Greene and the acronyms were presiding over a revolution that they couldn&apos;t control. Only a few years before, political interviewers had been politely deferential. &quot;Would you care, Home Secretary, to enlarge on the statement that you made to the House of Commons this afternoon?&quot; Suddenly deference seemed absurd. But how far could an interviewer go in the direction of disrespect? How far could television itself evolve from a realm of enlightenment, innocent fun and life-as-it-ought-to-be into a confrontational rough-house loud with the noise of life-as-it-is? Nobody knew. Mossman stood precisely on this cusp of change, though the abyss of darkness and uncertainty that he saw before him had a subjective aspect, too. I spoke with a number of people who had worked, like him, in current affairs. Not one banged on about the golden age when a team of as few as two, never more than four, in some unfamiliar place of crisis, devoid of any precise editorial brief, could make a first-class piece of documentary purely by following their instincts. Yet they evoked that age, and I kept thinking: how bold it was, how well it worked. I talked with many other of Mossman&apos;s friends and colleagues. They all remembered him with the greatest clarity, because he had made such a sharp impression at the time. I sometimes felt I was tapping a memory-well that had been kept fresh for just this purpose. Their memories were inconsistent with each other, as you would expect of such a compartmentalised life. Many described his passion for the truth, but he also emerged as a raconteur whose stories were packed with exaggerations. Straight colleagues remembered his implacable seriousness; gay friends who shared his social life remembered his frivolous wit, not all of which travels well. (&quot;His Lady Bracknell impression was hilarious.&quot;) A woman who had known him since his undergraduate days spoke movingly of their love for each other when young. To a respected senior at the BBC, he was a true professional: &quot;You could send him anywhere and say you wanted 12 minutes and that&apos;s what you got.&quot; Others described him turning a deaf ear to orders that didn&apos;t suit him. His rudeness to people he didn&apos;t like got a couple of mentions, and so did his kindness to those he did. The young researchers on his final arts programme, some of them now eminent in television, couldn&apos;t speak highly enough of the thoughtful way in which he had brought them on. His patrician manner turned out to be part-invention. His father, a Royal Flying Corps pilot, had been killed in a plane crash before he was born, after which he and his brother were brought up in a small mews flat over a garage off London&apos;s Westbourne Grove. From there, their beloved mother and equally beloved aunt went off each day to work in a bank and a toy factory respectively, in order to send the boys to public school. There was talk of a moneyed and grand connection, but it remained remote. Mossman&apos;s attempts in later years to track down the family coat of arms got nowhere at all. Characteristically, he saw the funny side of this. &quot;I met a horrid little man who told me that my family is completely undistinguished!&quot; he said to a friend, shaking with laughter. Other memories of him were darker. The crime of Vietnam was a persistent shadow that he couldn&apos;t dispel. Foreign reporting had burned him out ... well, that&apos;s one theory. He was disillusioned with television, he&apos;d been reprimanded once too often, he was in grief. One young researcher had remarked how pleasant it was that spring had arrived. &quot;That means nothing to me at all,&quot; Jim replied, more puzzled than anything else, before adding awkwardly, &quot;I don&apos;t know why.&quot; The common factor across the board was a sense of distance: &quot;One could never get under the skin of him.&quot; &quot;There was a shell that it was not easy to penetrate.&quot; &quot;He was different from the rest of us.&quot; Even close friends would interrupt the interview by saying suddenly, &quot;You know, I&apos;m not sure that I really knew him at all.&quot; The shock at the news of his death was compounded when his interview with the philosopher Stuart Hampshire went out soon after. Steered on to the subject of unhappiness, this most private and secret of interviewers had finally revealed his inner self to the viewing public. In BBC Kensington House, his team watched the film in amazement: &quot;Did Jim really say that?&quot; To anyone who knew him, the Jim of my play will be only a shadow of Jim in life. Relying on conflicting sources and a little imagination, I have tried to create a shadow with more facets than he chose to reveal to any one person still alive. I owe great thanks to the many people who shared their recollections with me. And I was helped by a number of books, among them Peter Adam&apos;s memoir of a remarkable life both in and out of the BBC, Not Drowning But Waving, and Selina Hastings&apos;s biography of Rosamond Lehmann. It was here that I learned of the odd friendship between novelist and reporter. The play is not a biography nor a history. It follows the essential architecture of James Mossman&apos;s life and death, but many incidents have been changed and others invented for dramatic effect. As a general rule, the more unlikely events are the ones that really happened. Jim, Louis and Rosamond are depicted as themselves, as far as I am capable of doing so. The same is true of Robin Day and Joan Marsden. All other BBC personnel and the character of Marko are imaginary, and should not be confused with anyone living or dead. \u00b7 The Reporter opens at the National Theatre, London SE1, on February 14.

Authorities in South Africa and the US are attempting to establish whether the body of Samuel Peter Benjamin, 17, could have been in the compartment since January 22, when the aircraft last visited Cape Town and six days before his body was found. It would mean that the corpse had travelled many thousands of miles, to Hong Kong, Singapore and Vancouver. The body was discovered by the pilot in a routine check on Sunday afternoon when the Boeing 747-700 was preparing to return to Heathrow, BA said. A post mortem earlier this week was complicated by the fact that the body was partly frozen when it was found. The LA county coroner&apos;s office said that further tests could take up to eight weeks. BA said it would be repatriating the body &quot;in the near future&quot;. Mr Benjamin was carrying identity documents, and his family have been informed. &quot;We are discussing he repatriation or otherwise of the remains,&quot; said Ronnie Mamoepa, a spokesman for South Africa&apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. &quot;The family is in shock as can be expected.&quot; The boy&apos;s mother said he left home without saying where he was going, the South African Press Association said. Attention is focusing on the possibility Mr Benjamin climbed into the wheel bay in Cape Town. A spokesman for BAA, which operates Heathrow, said it would be almost impossible to gain access to the runway at the airport. &quot;All passengers, except in very few circumstances, use air bridges to gain access to the aircraft. There&apos;s no direct access to the runway.&quot; Only in very rare cases do aircraft stowaways survive the lack of oxygen and extreme low temperatures - minus 56C at 11,000 metres (about 35,000ft) - in the unpressurised compartments. A spokesman for British Airways said: &quot;Our security measures are focused on prevention and we review every airport we fly to on a regular basis.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/feb/04/romantictrips.escape5", "sentences": ["Flying Singapore Airlines you could use 93,000 air miles and stop for two nights at the New Majestic Hotel for \u00a3460."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-04T23:57:27Z", "title": "Holiday clinic: How to sweep your lover off their feet", "tags": ["Romantic trips", "Travel"], "article": "&apos;We want a cheap version of our ideal holiday&apos; David Barnes, 32, is an artist and lecturer and lives in Glastonbury with Esther Harris, 31, who is a shoemaker. They have been together for nine years. The brief: &apos;We want to do something special this year as we are getting married in May. Our ideal holiday would be at least one month long, and somewhere hot, like Brazil, but we only have a weekend and \u00a3400 to spare. We&apos;d like to go away for a cultural weekend, with a mixture of art, music, wildlife, sunshine, independence and the unknown. We used to live in Lisbon and loved it there; there is a very romantic, faded glory and beauty about it. We also lived in Warsaw for a while, after meeting on a Tefl course, and spent six months in India. In hot weather we have camped or stayed somewhere cheap so we can spend more on good food, drink and doing stuff.&apos; The budget: \u00a3400 The solution Nikki Tinto: I recommend a weekend of &apos;living like a local&apos; in Barcelona, at one of Into Barcelona&apos;s funky apartments set in a maze of ancient alleyways in the trendy Born district, not far from the sea. They&apos;ll get more space and independence for their money than staying in a hotel. The Picasso Museum is around the corner, as are a host of bars and restaurants offering everything from traditional tapas to cutting-edge gastronomy. To satisfy their culture lust, Into Barcelona offers quirky walking tours to help them discover what they might never have found by staying there for a month. They could be taken behind the doors of local artists&apos; and designers&apos; studios, for example. One-bedroom apartments from \u00a375 a night (www.i-escape.com/intobarcelona). Return flights Bristol-Barcelona with Easyjet from \u00a3100 each. Alastair Sawday: I rule out a cheap weekend flight for ecological reasons. So - somewhere close-ish, vaguely exotic, inexpensive. How about taking a ferry to Le Havre in Normandy, as foot passengers, then taking a train and staying in Rouen? It is a grand old city with stacks to do and see, capital of some wonderful countryside and villages easy to get to by bike, and a short train ride from Paris. Le Clos Jouvenet is a splendid country house within its own walled gardens and only 15 minutes&apos; walk from the centre of town (www.leclosjouvenet.com). It is elegantly uncomplicated, full of books and antiques and run by a charming pair of hosts. \u00a3180 for three nights&apos; B&amp;B. Tom Marchant: Barcelona and Madrid are fast being overtaken by Valencia as the city to visit in Spain. You get gorgeous beaches, plus the Valencian Institute of Modern Art, the Palace of the Borja and the Reina Sofia Palace of Arts. Stay in the Ad Hoc hotel in the historical Xerea quarter, which has a lively nightlife, history and a beach. With cheap flights it can fit David and Esther&apos;s budget, and will give them a flavour of the Latin culture that they can expect to see in Brazil. From \u00a3199pp for two nights, including flights and accommodation with breakfast from www.blacktomato.co.uk. &apos;I like luxury, he&apos;s not bothered&apos; Ruth and Richard Harmer live in Darlington and have been married for 33 years. Ruth, 56, is recently retired and Richard, 59, is the director of a vehicle hire business. The brief: &apos;When you&apos;ve been married for 33 years, your idea of romance is quite different from when you are young and you&apos;ve just got together. I don&apos;t think Richard has a romantic bone in his body, but I used to always bake him a heart-shaped cake for Valentine&apos;s Day, and I might do one again this year. We&apos;d also like to spend a weekend away, somewhere in the UK. At this time of year we like to go to the Lake District to do some walking. For me, that means a little potter round a lake, but Richard likes to go up enormous hills. Afterwards I&apos;d like to relax with a nice bath and some champagne, but he&apos;d just fall asleep. I&apos;d like to be in nice romantic surroundings, with candles and things, and I like luxury, but he&apos;s not bothered. We went to the Wordsworth Hotel in the Lake District once, which I really liked because they served nouvelle cuisine in nice small portions, but Richard can&apos;t stand that - he gets too hungry. He had to go out and buy some crisps afterwards.&apos; The budget: \u00a3300 The solution  Nikki Tinto: The Punch Bowl Inn, a 300-year-old pub which recently had a chic makeover, could be just what they are looking for. Located in Crossthwaite on the edge of the Lake District, it&apos;s cosy and comfortable; downstairs in the bar, real ales are served alongside champagne. The food is excellent and should satisfy both of their palates - hearty fare (toad-in-the-hole and beef stew with dumplings) for Richard, as well as posh nosh (seared scallops and seabass with lemongrass dressing) for Ruth. Double rooms from \u00a3290 for two nights, including full English breakfast and afternoon cream tea. Andrew Brownsrigg: Head for Dover, cross the channel with P&amp;O to Calais and a 38-mile drive will take you to the Ferme Auberge des Chartroux, an idyllic farmhouse hotel in a lovely rural setting just outside the village of Maresville. Enjoy delicious three-course set dinners with produce fresh from the farm. You can visit Boulogne, Montreuil, the battlefields of Agincourt and Crecy or just stroll along the cliffs between Cap Blanc Nez and Cap Gris Nez. A two-night, half-board package including ferry is \u00a3114 per person with Inntravel. Juliet Kinsman: Under 100 miles from Darlington, the Sallyport in Berwick-on-Tweed has all the requisites for a romantic escape: roaring fire, big baths with bath oil, champagne chilling. If Ruth wants Valentine&apos;s-themed decor, she&apos;ll love the heart-detailed Tiffany suite. They should take advantage of the ex-restaurateur owner&apos;s culinary skills, especially as there&apos;s a new dining room for the most intimate Provencal supper. Rooms cost \u00a390 to \u00a3140; dinner \u00a335 a head. The north-east coastline boasts the most romantic beaches for long walks: Holy Island, Bamburgh and Embleton beach are all nearby. Book through www.mrandmrssmith.com.  &apos;We haven&apos;t found time for a honeymoon yet&apos; Stephen Grindrod, 31, and his partner Phillip Roak, 37, have been together for two years and had a civil ceremony in December. They have just bought a flat in Borough, London. Phillip is president and CEO of his family business, a web technology consultancy; Stephen is its global website manager. The brief: &apos;We are quite romantic: in the past we&apos;ve hired a helicopter to take us to a secluded beach in the Whitsunday Islands in Australia for a romantic afternoon. We like to have a bit of pampering on holiday, and stay at top of the market, design spa hotels. We would like some exposure to regional culture and the gay night life if it is there. On a longer holiday, multiple destinations are advised to keep our attention, and we enjoy holidays with our friends, so it could be nice to have them meet us along the way for a leg of the journey. We&apos;d like to go for two-to-three weeks in September, probably to Thailand, but we are open to suggestions.&apos; The budget: Up to \u00a310,000, plus we have 600,000 air miles available. The solution Andrew Brownrigg: We suggest a four-centre holiday. Flying into Bangkok you will spend five nights at the wonderful Oriental hotel and spa. While in Bangkok you can have a full day&apos;s private sightseeing, visit bars, nightclubs and the famous Pat Phong night market. Then fly up to Chiang Mai and spend three nights at the Four Seasons Hotel. It has one of the world&apos;s most beautiful spas, and you could enjoy an elephant safari followed by a rafting expedition. From Chiang Mai you can spend two nights at the Four Seasons at Chiang Rai in the jungle, then five nights at the stylish Karma Samui, on Koh Samui, where friends can join you in a two-bedroom villa, with its own pool. All this would cost \u00a34,199 per person with Abercrombie &amp; Kent. With air miles you can fly first class for around 30,000 miles each, plus taxes, booking fees etc. Nikki Tinto: Bali is where two worlds collide: temples and legends with designer boutiques, mixologists and celebrity chefs. Stephen and Phillip could spend two weeks split between three destinations, starting at the Bale on the south coast, a hip hotel with private infinity pools, a holistic spa and a chef to prepare lobster barbecues in their own pavilion. They could then head inland to Ubud, Bali&apos;s cultural hub to spend a few nights at the ultra-stylish Uma Ubud. From here they would travel over the mountains to the unspoilt north coast and stay at one of Puri Ganesha&apos;s four very private beach villas. It is owned by quirky English interior designer, Diana von Cranach, who runs innovative raw food cookery courses and detox regimens. You can arrive by car, helicopter or Harley-Davidson. It costs \u00a36,260 including helicopter transfers. Flying Singapore Airlines you could use 93,000 air miles and stop for two nights at the New Majestic Hotel for \u00a3460. All booked via www.i-escape.com. &apos;We want to celebrate our anniversary&apos; Katharine Marr, 32, and Craig Smith, 32, run a translation company together and live in Northamptonshire. The brief: &apos;We met each other 10 years ago on Valentine&apos;s Day and got married last year, so we want to celebrate our anniversary by doing something special for Valentine&apos;s Day. We have been on romantic trips together in the past, including city breaks in boutique hotels and a trip to Austria. We love shopping at chic furniture shops and clothes boutiques, and we enjoy good food, cream teas and wine. We both like the outdoors and walks in the countryside and we&apos;d like to bring our cocker spaniel, Zippy. Our perfect holiday would be relaxed, staying in a cool, sexy hotel that isn&apos;t too pretentious. We would like to learn a new language and meet new people, so maybe eastern Europe with its magical castles, cooler weather (we don&apos;t like the sun) and diverse culture may be of interest.&apos; The budget: \u00a3800 for a weekend The solution  Alastair Sawday: Croatia could be just the country. Taking an overnight train to Venice on a Thursday might be a delightfully romantic way of making the journey special. They&apos;d have time for a ride on the Grand Canal before driving a hire car to the northern tip of Croatia, getting to Motovun in time for dinner. It is one of the prettiest towns in Croatia. Stay in an apartment in the Bella Vista, an old stone house run by Mirjana, a bubbly woman who might even take you truffle hunting with her hound. The local eating is superb and the views glorious. Andrew Brownrigg: Fly to Tallinn, the stunning capital of Estonia and spend two nights at the beautiful boutique design hotel, The Three Sisters, in the old town. A two night &apos;Lovers&apos; Escape&apos; in a junior suite includes breakfast , a three-course dinner with wine and a &apos;surprise&apos; for \u00a3610. You can enjoy some walks by the sea when not exploring the fascinating fairy-tale city&apos;s churches, castles, restaurants and shops. The hotel doesn&apos;t normally take pets, but they said they would make an exception if Zippy is clean and quiet! He must have his pet passport (it takes six months to obtain) and as long as he does not weigh more than 8kgs you can fly him with you in the cabin, in a container, on Estonian Airways as excess baggage at a cost of \u00a36 per kilo; your flights will cost \u00a3166 per person from Gatwick. Flights are available from Stansted on Easyjet for about \u00a393 per person, but Easyjet will not take pets. Tom Marchant: Reykjavik is a fantastic city combining stunning landscapes, exciting activities and cool urban chic. The chic Hotel 101 is one of the best modern hotels in the capital, and you can shop in the designer stores, journey out to the volcanoes and glaciers or swim in the famous thermal pools. And with the pet passport, Zippy can go with you. In the evening, try the city&apos;s cutting-edge nightlife. From \u00a3399 for two nights including flights, transfers and B&amp;B at Hotel 101, with Black Tomato.

Twelve years ago last week, when he was a 19-year-old apprentice gardener, he used a borrowed butterfly knife, its 11cm blade unfolded from the twin halves of its hinged wooden handle, to stab Claudio Vincenzo Spagnolo - &quot;Spagna&quot; to his friends - to death outside the Stadio Luigi Ferraris in Genoa, before a match against Milan. Four days later more than 10,000 people turned up outside the church for the funeral of Spagnolo, an unemployed 24-year-old who had been among a group of Genoa supporters confronted by, or confronting, members of a gang of Milan supporters who called themselves the Gruppo Barbour, after their fondness for the British-made waxed jackets. Leaving his victim in a pool of blood on the pavement, Barbaglia swapped clothes with another member, hid the knife in a wine carton and entered the stadium. Not until Monday morning, when he was back home in Milan, did the police arrive at his mother&apos;s apartment. By that time the entire Italian sporting programme for the following weekend had been cancelled. Only a Davis Cup tie in Naples against the Czech Republic was allowed to continue, so as not to inconvenience Italy&apos;s opponents. Some people were critical. &quot;This is a decision taken with the heart rather than the head - it isn&apos;t a solution,&quot; said Gianni Rivera, a Milan hero turned politician. But Italy&apos;s recently elected prime minister, Lamberto Dini, said that, if football could not reform itself, he would do the job. In Genoa that week, having stood among the thousands of scarves and bunches of flowers left at the site of the murder, I drove to Sampdoria&apos;s training ground and talked to David Platt, who had just returned from attending Spagnolo&apos;s funeral. The cancellation, he said, at least showed that the matter was being taken seriously. &quot;What it actually does apart from that, I&apos;m not sure,&quot; he continued. &quot;The underlying feeling is that, yes, it&apos;s right to postpone the games because it sends the message that we don&apos;t support this kind of thing and that there is something bigger than football. But I don&apos;t think that by itself it&apos;s going to stop hooliganism in Italy.&quot; A year or so before Spagnolo&apos;s death Vanessa Redgrave compared the experience of watching a big match at San Siro to an opening night at La Scala. Amid the furs and the cashmeres of the president&apos;s box you could see how she came to that conclusion. But she would have needed only to turn her head 45 degrees, in either direction, to witness scenes that more closely resembled the Circus Maximus. The extremes of Italian football - expressed again last summer in a World Cup final victory that, as well as scenes of glory, included Marco Materazzi&apos;s provocation of Zinedine Zidane - may have something to do with the sort of tensions that exploded in Catania last Friday night, when the killing of a policeman, Filippo Raciti, prompted the latest cancellation of a weekend&apos;s matches. The roots of such an incident certainly go deeper than a simple rivalry between two Sicilian cities. Italy has given so much to world football that it is painful to see the nightmare recurring. As any reader of John Foot&apos;s excellent book Calcio will be aware, however, the history of violence and corruption goes back a long way. The question must be whether the murder of a policeman last Friday is the incident that finally persuades Italian football to attempt a fresh start. In England the game&apos;s second chance was partly paid for in Italian blood when the combination of Heysel, Bradford and Hillsborough achieved a kind of critical mass. The subsequent bourgeoisification of English football, accelerated by the invention of the Premiership, created the conditions in which ticket prices could be raised so high that, combined with effective security precautions, they eventually deterred hooligans, whose violent activities have largely been displaced, in a diluted form, to the lower divisions. In Italy, by contrast, you can still turn up at a Serie A match and buy a ticket for less than a tenner. A cursory search at the turnstile is unlikely to reveal the flare taped to your inner thigh. Inside the stadium the facilities are rudimentary and your activities will be neither observed by the kind of closed-circuit cameras that scan every inch of an English stadium nor supervised by any kind of rigorous stewarding. Municipal ownership of Italian club stadiums is partly to blame. When you don&apos;t own your home, you are less likely to mind what happens there. But one thing the Italians must do is start to police matches properly - which means more than just shepherding the away fans to the train station after the match. The unhealthy relationship between the clubs and their hard-core fans also needs modifying. If Luca Pancalli, Italy&apos;s football commissioner, can find a way of dismantling the influence of the &quot;ultra&quot; groups, who receive tickets and travel benefits from the clubs and expect a blind eye to be turned to their less savoury activities in return for their loyalty, he will have taken a step towards ensuring that the tragic death of Filippo Raciti, unlike that of Claudio Spagnolo, was not entirely in vain. Jenkins and Wales could learn from England&apos;s gamble on talent Two coaches made their Six Nations debuts at the weekend. One gambled and won, the other played a conservative card and lost. Maybe Gareth Jenkins would argue that the absence of Gavin Henson would have made no difference to the outcome of Wales&apos;s match against Ireland but it was sad to see the golden boy of the 2005 Grand Slam in the grandstand instead of out where he belonged, performing in front of a full house in Cardiff. Although Henson&apos;s lack of recent form gave Jenkins a plausible excuse for dropping him, it seemed a bad decision when he announced it and a worse one when the result was in. Some players respond to a hurtful rebuff by redoubling their efforts while others go into a sulk. The evidence suggests that Henson may belong to the latter category, meaning that Jenkins&apos; decision is unlikely to provoke the positive response for which, presumably, he is hoping. Which is a shame for those of us, Welsh and otherwise, who would rather see a world-class player wearing a rugby shirt rather than a suit and tie. As Brian Ashton proved, sometimes you just have to trust the talent. Ecclestone is tearing up the roots of formula one There will be no grand prix this year at Imola, where the track follows the natural topography of land defined by vineyards and old houses on the banks of the Santerno river. But a couple of days after announcing a long-term extension to Bahrain&apos;s contract, Bernie Ecclestone signed a seven-year deal with Abu Dhabi and indicated that South Korea, India and Singapore will shortly join the calendar. As ever, the formula one rights holder Ecclestone is following the money and in the process precipitating the biggest change in a single sport since Kerry Packer announced his cricket revolution. The next countries to feel his squeeze will be France, host of the very first grand prix in 1907, and Britain, where the inaugural world championship race was held more than half a century ago. White flag flies over Madrid The white handkerchiefs were out on Sunday night as Real Madrid lost to Levante for the first time in their history, with Fabio Capello, ranting in vain on the touchline, looking more and more like Gary Megson. You could only feel sorry for 19-year-old Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, the latest import from Argentina, whose tender young talent is being allowed to shrivel in the Bernab\u00e9u&apos;s desert."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/feb/06/gdnsport3.sport", "sentences": ["He had been so exact in his lobbying of IOC delegates that, when voting started in Singapore, he was &quot;incredibly confident."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-06T00:08:20Z", "title": "Big interview: Sir Keith Mills", "tags": ["Sport"], "article": "&quot;I hate losing,&quot; Sir Keith Mills says with such force that it suddenly becomes plain why this amiable and rotund 56-year-old is a fiercely competitive and hardened winner. As chief executive of London&apos;s successful bid to stage the Olympic Games in 2012, Mills proved that &quot;winning against significant odds on a world stage requires searing focus and remarkable organisation&quot;. His next mighty escapade, however, will stretch him to the very limit - for Mills is now chasing a seemingly impossible dream. A romantic gambling streak might colour his sporting adventures but the fantasy of a first British yachting victory in the America&apos;s Cup has burned inside Mills for years. In 2003, when Barbara Cassani, the American businesswoman who initially led London&apos;s Olympic bid, asked him to take control of a derided campaign, Mills protested that he was planning his assault on the oldest trophy in world sport. &quot;Barbara said if London won the Olympic vote, then my chances of winning the America&apos;s Cup would rise exponentially. She also said you can have a crack at the America&apos;s Cup any time but an Olympic Games comes along once in your life. That was very poignant. I also knew if I allowed someone else to do it I&apos;d feel dreadful whether they won or lost.&quot; Now Mills is finally set to pursue a deeply personal ambition. The America&apos;s Cup started here in 1851 - predating the FA Cup by two decades - but that very race set a template for British mediocrity. Fifteen Royal Squadron yachts were beaten around the Isle of Wight by a lone American schooner which crossed the line 20 minutes ahead of its closest rival. America repelled all challenges until Australia broke the longest winning streak in sporting history in 1983. A first European winner emerged in 2003 - from land-locked Switzerland. Mills was stung, and then inspired, by the irony. &quot;Before I committed myself I needed to be confident we could win it. I don&apos;t want to just compete. Sailing has been one of our most successful Olympic sports [with Britain winning more medals, five in total, than any other country at both the 2000 and 2004 Games] and we&apos;ve got great talent among yachtsmen and designers. The fact we&apos;ve got 60 Brits working in America&apos;s Cup teams in this year&apos;s competition in Valencia is a huge advantage. I&apos;m very confident the bulk of them will join our entry for the next race.&quot; Ben Ainslie, winner of two Olympic golds for Britain, is currently part of the New Zealand team. &quot;He&apos;s an outstanding match racer and Ben&apos;s always had two main goals - to win the Olympics and the America&apos;s Cup in a British boat. He&apos;s done the first and he can do the second. Other Olympic medal-winning British sailors, like Iain Percy and Ian Walker, are also getting good experience in Valencia. We&apos;ll go for the best in the world when picking our team but I&apos;d be surprised if the majority were not British. &quot;We need methodical planning and a belief that this is a challenge for the whole country. The image of a billionaire - and incidentally I&apos;m not one - using the America&apos;s Cup as his toy doesn&apos;t work. We&apos;re intent on building a professional operation, backed by British business and the public. It will cost \u00a320m a year to mount a serious challenge and in a worst-case scenario commercial sponsorship will fund half and we&apos;ll cough up the rest.&quot; Would Mills need to invest \u00a310m of his own loose change each year? He grins. &quot;At the moment &apos;we&apos; means &apos;me&apos;. But I expect to have two or three other &apos;mes&apos; pretty soon.&quot; As the marketing guru who invented the concept of Air Miles in 1988 Mills has long been a multi-millionaire. However, with his ruddy face and lack of pomp, the self-proclaimed &quot;Essex boy&quot; who left school at 15 has a populist touch. He smoothly distils the vast economic benefits should Britain win the America&apos;s Cup - especially for any town on the south coast which would be called upon to host a defence of the trophy. Mills brought that same visionary zeal to London&apos;s Olympic bid. He had been so exact in his lobbying of IOC delegates that, when voting started in Singapore, he was &quot;incredibly confident. The moment I knew we&apos;d won, before the final vote had been cast, was vivid. Eight of us went up to the prime minister&apos;s suite - me and three of my team with Denise Lewis, Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and Jonathan Edwards - and watched television as other cities were knocked out. When Madrid got knocked out I burst into tears. No one believed me but I&apos;d done the numbers. I knew London had won.&quot; And if Madrid had knocked out Paris before the final round? &quot;We&apos;d have lost,&quot; says Mills, grimacing with certainty. Now, with less then 2,000 days left, Mills continues his work as deputy chairman of the 2012 London Olympic Organising Committee which &quot;focuses on the huge infrastructure that still needs to be built as well as how we will find the \u00a32 billion to fund it commercially&quot;. As speculation rises that costs are spiralling far in excess of that mark, Mills insists &quot;the issue is how much regeneration London wants to undertake after the Games - and that&apos;s as long as a piece of string. The actual costs of the stadium and running the Games hasn&apos;t changed at all.&quot; In pure sporting terms Mills is emphatic: &quot;We can run the best Olympic Games in history but [British] sporting success is critical. If we haven&apos;t done well in the medal table the country will consider London 2012 a failure. Athletics, for example, needs to get its act together. But we seem to do well in sports where we&apos;re sitting down - on bikes, boats and horses. It&apos;s when we start running and jumping that we have problems.&quot; His vast Olympic remit, running alongside the America&apos;s Cup, does not leave him much free time. Yet Tottenham Hotspur recently persuaded him to join their board as a non-executive director. &quot;It could be good fun,&quot; Mills says lightly. &quot;One of my tasks is a fiduciary role to make sure it is properly run as a plc. I&apos;ll also help Spurs build a better database of their fans and improving access to tickets.&quot; The need for Spurs to expand is urgent - either through major refurbishment of White Hart Lane or by emulating Arsenal&apos;s new stadium with a capacity approaching 60,000. Mills will not be drawn on the likelier option or even whether Wembley might be a temporary rented home but he is bullish about &quot;Spurs&apos; great potential both nationally and internationally&quot;. But, as the club scrambles to stay within sight of Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal, Mills balks at the Premiership&apos;s distortion of the traditional competitiveness of English football. &quot;I&apos;ve always felt the Premiership is an unhealthy structure - it&apos;s unbalanced if we have the same few teams vying for the top. Unless the financial structure changes the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. But the revenue is now driven from the Far East, there is an insatiable international desire for the Premiership.&quot; Mills&apos; global acumen will benefit Spurs, the London Olympics and the America&apos;s Cup. His work on all three fronts will also be more thoroughly prepared than his first attempt to conquer the world. &quot;When I was 19 I tried to circumnavigate the world on a tandem with a guy called Pete Wells. We left in a blaze of glory - the Daily Express put us on the front page. But we miscalculated the amount of weight we put on the tandem and by the time we got to northern France we were breaking nine spokes a day. We were soon flat broke and our challenge ended in Marseille. &quot;I&apos;ve learnt one or two things since then but I&apos;ve promised my wife that the America&apos;s Cup will be my last big challenge. That will take me until at least 2011 - or 2013 if we win. Don&apos;t tell her but, if I get my way, we&apos;ll just keep on winning and I&apos;ll go on until I&apos;m well past 80.&quot; Mills sinks back in his chair and laughs, as if he has just let slip his latest secret ambition."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2007/feb/07/gamedevelopers2", "sentences": ["The GDCAs have been nominated this year by people from Singapore, from Britain, from France, from Hong Kong, from Venezuela, from Belgium, from Canada, from the USA, and so on."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-07T11:23:41Z", "title": "Game Developers Choice Awards Finalists announced", "tags": ["Gaming awards", "Technology", "Games"], "article": "The Annual Game Developers Choice Awards finalists have been announced by the International Game Developers Association (phew, that&apos;s a lot of descriptive words), and the press release with all the details is here.

But that&apos;s another post, for another day. Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s coming. But on a related rant, you can get a non-insider&apos;s view on the GDCA at Firing Squad who interviews the Academy of Interactive Arts and Science&apos;s President Joseph Olin. The article makes a nod to the Choice Awards about halfway down. From my reading, I think Olin implies that the Choice Awards are the Golden Globes to their AIAS Oscars. Well, to counteract, comparing the AIAS awards with the Choice Awards is like comparing apples and oranges. Both the Globes and the Oscars are US awards, voted for by people in the American Academy of Motion Pictures. Who are citizens of the USA. The GDCAs have been nominated this year by people from Singapore, from Britain, from France, from Hong Kong, from Venezuela, from Belgium, from Canada, from the USA, and so on. From 25 countries from around the world. These are different awards, with different scopes, and I feel it&apos;s far far more important to recognise international contributions rather than those from just one region. It is, in fact, a GLOBAL industry. At least we try. Off soapbox.

It feels like totally different air to a Boeing 747.&quot; The long-delayed Airbus A380, the world&apos;s biggest passenger plane, took its first public flight yesterday as more than 200 journalists and company bosses took off from Toulouse on a two-hour flight over the Pyrenees piloted by British and German captains keen to show off the plane&apos;s much publicised &quot;quiet, smooth and fuel-efficient ride&quot;. It was the 2,000th take-off for the superjumbo, which has already flown around the world on a series of tests, passing the north and south poles and stopping off at air shows. But it was the first time the media were able to film the spacious interior of the \u20ac230m (\u00a3150m) double-decker, which some airlines are considering fitting with a gym, shops, bars and showers. The most complex passenger plane ever built, with a production line stretching between France, Britain, Germany and Spain, the A380 project has been beset with problems since engineers struggled to install the 300 miles of wiring, setting off a spiral of delays that led to boardroom turmoil, executive resignations and the wrath of airline buyers who are currently negotiating compensation. The head of the A380 programme yesterday said costs were under control despite a spate of recent profit warnings that drove Airbus into loss last year and which will see a restructuring plan unveiled later this month. Executives yesterday declined to talk figures and instead focused on the champagne celebration on board. &quot;This is the biggest thing since the dawn of the 747 in the late 1960s,&quot; said Chris Stonehouse, vice-president of the customer programme, standing at the top of a sweeping, purple-carpeted staircase as the plane cruised at over 40,000ft. The A380 has a capacity of 840 people, but as airlines compete to give premium passengers more space for more money, it will likely hold an average of 525, compared with around 360 on a Boeing 747. When it launches for Singapore Airlines later this year it could have features such as a gym, cocktail bar, nursery, and private first-class cabin suites with their own sliding doors, desk and bed. The digital entertainment systems will aim to offer up to 80 films on demand at any time, as well as live TV and potentially on-board internet. The seat-back screens, at around 18 by 10 inches, are almost twice the size of screens on today&apos;s planes. Yesterday, the plane&apos;s &quot;magic lighting&quot; and &quot;programmed mood scenarios&quot; included piped classical music and a blue hue in business class. But with the widest cabin in passenger airline history, and 50% more floor surface than the 747, the economy seats are 1-inch wider than on current jumbos and stressed travellers will benefit from seeing more space above their heads, more room to stretch and to walk up and down stairs. On the upper deck, Kieran Daly, editor of the Flight Group magazine publisher, who had tested out seats in all classes, told the Guardian: &quot;It&apos;s startlingly quiet. We knew it was quiet from outside [on take-off], but inside it&apos;s dramatic. I was right in line with the engines for take-off, but, having a conversation, I didn&apos;t need to raise my voice at all.&quot; Airbus programme managers call the plane the &quot;green giant&quot; for its comparative fuel efficiency and relatively low carbon emissions. On departure in rainy Toulouse, it was also clear that it requires 10% less runway to take off than a 747 and can rise higher faster. By 2011, around 70 airports world-wide will deal with A380 flights. The superjumbo can fly non-stop for 9,300 miles, taking it between destinations such as London and Hong Kong without any problems with cargo or windspeeds. But, as one British official said before take-off: &quot;Europe to Oz is still the holy grail.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/feb/08/insideit.guardianweeklytechnologysection1", "sentences": ["Within hours, these images were uploaded on to blogs, wikis and websites where thousands of people around the world - who shared their own images from events that happened simultaneously in Berlin, San Francisco, Toronto and Singapore - struggled to decode what it all meant, and whether it had any relationship with a mysterious Microsoft employee named Loki."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-08T23:47:39Z", "title": "Inside IT: The game genre that could not exist without the net", "tags": ["Technology"], "article": "I was walking through Trafalgar Square two weeks ago when the National Portrait Gallery exploded in colour. Shapes and patterns lit up its surface, creating a dazzling but confusing spectacle. All around, people captured the multimedia chaos on camera. Within hours, these images were uploaded on to blogs, wikis and websites where thousands of people around the world - who shared their own images from events that happened simultaneously in Berlin, San Francisco, Toronto and Singapore - struggled to decode what it all meant, and whether it had any relationship with a mysterious Microsoft employee named Loki. I&apos;d been witness to a clue in an Alternate Reality Game, or ARG, sponsored by Microsoft to promote Windows Vista. In these cross-media collaborative treasure hunts, clues to an overarching story are hidden in every conceivable medium of distribution. Hundreds of thousands of players work together via digital channels to solve the games&apos; puzzles. Ultimate prize Over the past six weeks, a hive mind of tens of thousands of early adopters, retired couples, manual labourers, mothers, schoolchildren, college students and commuters from around the world have been scanning newspaper classifieds, watching television ads, analysing websites, making phone calls, sending emails and piecing together clues littered across the international landscape to solve the puzzles in Vanishing Point, a game engineered by 42 Entertainment to build buzz around the Microsoft brand and Vista. The ultimate prize is a trip for one on the Rocketplane XP to what the marketing company describes as &quot;the Ultimate Vista&quot;. A tenuous link, perhaps, but enough to get the geek brigade in its thrall. The ARG movement couldn&apos;t come at a better time for advertisers, whose awkward grip on interactive marketing has resulted in the explosion of several social software landmines. Big corporations from Sony to Proctor &amp; Gamble have felt consumer ire when their manipulations of Web 2.0 staples such as YouTube, MySpace and blogs have been uncovered as corporate fakes. The situation has become so chronic that the US Federal Trade Commission recently announced that it will investigate social marketing campaigns where links between endorsers and companies aren&apos;t disclosed. Marketers are using such tactics because television and print advertising aren&apos;t as effective as they have been in the past. &quot;Not only can we easily filter such messages, but we&apos;re both more aware of and more sceptical of them,&quot; explains Brooke Thompson, a cross-media consultant and game designer. &quot;So they have to reach out in new ways in order to engage consumers and get their messages to spread.&quot; &quot;From a marketer&apos;s perspective, ARGs rest on the idea that buzz, social interaction and people talking to one another will generate sales,&quot; explains Henrik Ornebring, senior lecturer in Television Studies at Roehampton University. But because no one is endorsing a particular product, it gets around the FTC. It also helps that ARGs force a close reading of all media, including TV ads, which have been increasingly falling victim to services like Sky+ and TiVo. ARGs are often associated with commercial products, particularly films, TV series, computer games and other lifestyle accessories, enhancing the stories behind them and providing fodder for fans to discuss in online communities. While the &quot;Who&apos;s Loki&quot; premise of Vanishing Point bears little relevance to Vista, there&apos;s obvious synergy between Microsoft and an entertainment/advertising format that uses all that interactivity has to offer. Most of the players are the first to go out and buy their products. &quot;We don&apos;t have to tell them Vista is coming,&quot; says Brian Marr of Microsoft. &quot;Most of them can tell me features I don&apos;t know about.&quot; So why preach to the converted? In exchange for taking part in an enormous ad campaign, ARG players are offered carefully constructed gameplay. Marr says it&apos;s amazing what brands can get out of the cost, &quot;which is surprisingly less than a Super Bowl ad [costing $2.6m (\u00a31.3m) for 30 seconds] for a month of entertaining and exciting content for customers who are key to spreading the information&quot;. Vanishing Point&apos;s first clue, a puzzle box with a USB thumb drive, was sent to influential technology blogs. &quot;I received a puzzle box from Microsoft over the holidays when I was visiting my in-laws,&quot; says Josh Phillips of windowsconnected.com. &quot;That was pretty fascinating because I don&apos;t know how they knew I was there.&quot; The added element of intrigue and, &quot;being an IT guy, puzzles really appeal to my more inquisitive nature&quot;, means that Phillips is an ARG convert. His coverage of Vanishing Point has brought a broader set of individuals to his site than the content would normally bring. While there are precedents to mixed-media treasure hunting, such as Kit Williams&apos; 1979 book Masquerade and correspondent-hunts in 20th-century newspapers, the ARG phenomenon could only have happened in a world where everything from a series of numbers to a lingering shot of a book spine in a television programme inspires frantic speculating by an international online fan community. (What do the lottery numbers in Lost mean, if anything? Why do they recur? Is it because ... and so the discussion begins.) &quot;In a way, it&apos;s the first genre that could not be conceived of without the internet,&quot; says Ornebring. According to digital pundits and ARG-watchers, the new entertainment medium is at the centre of Web 2.0, inspiring creativity across multiple media, user-generated content and collaborative experiences shaped by a savvy global audience who connect via digital channels. Not all winners &quot;A very key trend which is right at the heart of what ARGs are all about is participatory culture: the convergence of collective media, how they&apos;re interconnected and a collective intelligence,&quot; explains Michael Smith, CEO of London-based ARG developer Mind Candy. &quot;All three of these elements are popping up all over the place, and ARGs are right at the centre of it.&quot; Sure, the final prize may only go to one person, but the social ethos generated by playing together means that everyone feels like a winner. Though Ornebring suggests that there may be a loser: the marketing company. ARGs are much more successful in marketing the phenomenon of ARGs rather than the product they&apos;re meant to be selling. To keep the suspension of disbelief, the brand often doesn&apos;t get a mention until the very end. By that point, only the most dedicated players are privy to the message. The buzz surrounding the game has done little else than create buzz for the new genre. Unfortunately, as history attests, developers run a danger of alienating their fans if they make the marketing more explicit. The participatory element has led some to believe that the ARG medium need not be commercially motivated. An Ofcom discussion paper released this week uses ARGs as an example of a kind of entertainment a Public Service Publisher could provide (see Gamesblog, 1 February). Smith agrees. &quot;They can be used for positive social ends,&quot; he says, &quot;like creating an ARG about fuel. You could get people to plant trees as part of the backstory. There&apos;s a wide scope.&quot; No one is willing to speculate on the impact of an influx of ARG-based marketing on the entertainment medium or on consumer preferences, but an overall aim is to expand the audience by reducing the barriers to entry. Some propose relying more on video channels, others suggest situating more clues in traditional media sources. The trend is ultimately to continue the so-called &quot;conversations&quot; between producers and consumers in an ARG way. Regardless of the outcome, everyday life has suddenly become a lot more fun. \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to  tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/10/digitalmedia.india", "sentences": ["It has already approached fellow Bharti shareholder Singapore&apos;s SingTel about buying the stake."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-10T15:00:16Z", "title": "Vodafone enters bid for Indian mobile firm", "tags": ["Media", "Business", "Digital media", "India", "Media business", "Mobile phones", "World news", "Vodafone"], "article": "Vodafone and a clutch of rivals, including Indian mobile phone operator Reliance Communications and a Russian investment group, were last night understood to have made indicative offers for India&apos;s fourth largest mobile phone company, Hutchison Essar. The board of Hutchison Telecom International, controlled by Hong Kong-based billionaire Li Ka-shing, is expected to meet tomorrow to examine the offers, which are likely to value its Indian mobile arm at $18bn to $20bn (\u00a39.2bn to \u00a310.2bn). Hutchison&apos;s decision to put its 67% of the mobile phone company up for sale sparked the bidding war. The rest of the company is owned by India-based conglomerate Essar. Last night sources close to Essar said it had also tabled an offer to buy Hutchison&apos;s stake, with financial backing from Citigroup. Vodafone wants to get its hands on the company to increase its exposure to one of the fastest growing mobile markets on the planet. It needs growth in developing markets to offset the fierce competition in its core areas such as western Europe. In these countries, where most people have a phone, Vodafone is looking to increase revenues with new data services. Having announced deals earlier this week with eBay and MySpace, Vodafone yesterday unveiled a partnership with online video site YouTube, owned by Google, designed to persuade customers to do more with their phones than just make calls and send texts. Launching in the UK first, the YouTube mobile service will let Vodafone customers watch a daily selection of new YouTube videos, send links to their favourite clips to friends and even upload their own video content to the YouTube site. Also involved in the race for control of Hutchison Essar is local operator Reliance, which has backing for its bid from a consortium of banks including ABN Amro, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Buying the company would catapult Reliance from number two in the Indian market to number one, overtaking current market leader Bharti Airtel. Vodafone bought a 10% stake in Bharti Airtel just a year ago for \u00a3820m and would have to sell it if its bid was accepted for Hutchison Essar. It has already approached fellow Bharti shareholder Singapore&apos;s SingTel about buying the stake. Also interested in making an offer for Hutchison Essar is Hinduja Group, controlled by the family which includes the London-based billionaire Hinduja brothers. It is still carrying out due diligence, however, and has been pressing for an extension to the bid deadline of midnight last night set by the Hutchison board. It was unclear last night whether the Hindujas, who are reported to have linked up with Qatar Telecom for their bid, had actually been able to put together a substantive proposal or were still asking for more time. A new player emerged in the battle last night with sources saying that Russia&apos;s Altimo has joined forces with Rothschild and Japanese bank Nomura to make a bid. Essar, meanwhile, had been expected to sit on the sidelines in the first round of bids for Hutchison&apos;s stake. The company has always maintained that it has first refusal on Hutchison&apos;s stake in the business."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/12/japan.internationalnews", "sentences": ["The US treasury secretary is more concerned about the ballooning American trade deficit with China and the G7 reiterated a call, first issued in Singapore last autumn, for greater flexibility by Beijing in managing the yuan and ensuring it is effectively revalued."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-12T00:02:22Z", "title": "G7 talk up Japanese economy with warning against currency bets", "tags": ["Business", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Finance ministers from the leading industrialised countries sought at the weekend to call a halt to the continuing decline of the yen, insisting that Japan&apos;s economic recovery after a decade of deflation was sustainable. The G7 group, including central bank governors, coupled their efforts to talk up the Japanese economy with a warning to traders betting on further weakness in the yen that they could get burned. The Japanese currency has lost 11% of its value against the euro and 4% against the US dollar in the past year, prompting fears on either side of the Atlantic that American and European exports will be damaged. The yen&apos;s weakness, partly due to fears about the depth of the recovery, is compounded by interest rates of 0.25%. After a low-key meeting in Essen, the finance ministers and central bankers declared: &quot;Japan&apos;s recovery is on track and is expected to continue. We are confident that the implications of these developments will be recognised by market participants and will be incorporated in their assessments of risk.&quot; A bevy of ministers refused to comment directly but their statement is viewed as a coded warning to the foreign exchange markets that so-called carry trades - huge borrowing in low-yield currencies such as the yen to reinvest profitably elsewhere - are a high-risk practice. The clearest warning came from Jean-Claude Trichet, European Central Bank president, who said: &quot;We want the markets to be aware of the risks of one-way bets, in particular on the foreign exchange market. One-way bets would not be, it seems to us, appropriate.&quot; But analysts said the statement, reaffirming that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals, was unlikely to have a sizeable effect when markets open later today. The yen was trading at about 158 to the euro on Friday last week but the Japanese central bank could give it a boost by raising rates later this week. Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, was urged by four senior Congress committee chairmen last week to press the Japanese government to reverse the weak yen by selling off its massive reserves. Asserting that the weakness was the direct result of policy in Tokyo, they said it had helped Japanese car exports to the US rise by 30% at the expense of American manufacturers. Insisting that exchange rates were determined &quot;in a competitive marketplace&quot;, Mr Paulson drew on a &quot;very favourable&quot; report by his Japanese counterpart, Koji Omi, to declare that Japan &quot;is firmly on the path to sustainable recovery&quot; despite low domestic consumption. The US treasury secretary is more concerned about the ballooning American trade deficit with China and the G7 reiterated a call, first issued in Singapore last autumn, for greater flexibility by Beijing in managing the yuan and ensuring it is effectively revalued. Ministers, meanwhile, called for a successful outcome of the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks, warning against a rise in protectionism and insisting that freer trade could reduce poverty in developing countries. But aid organisations accused them of failing to set a clear timetable for increasing aid and urged the host country, Germany, to set a lead now that its own economic recovery is assured."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/13/news.paulmacinnes", "sentences": ["A lot of the time he seemed on edge.&quot; In September Williams cancelled an Asian tour of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Mumbai (Bombay) and Bangalore due to stress and exhaustion."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-13T12:11:12Z", "title": "Robbie Williams goes into rehab on his birthday", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "article": "Robbie Williams has been checked into rehab on his birthday to deal with an addiction to prescription drugs, it was revealed this morning.

Singh, who became the second Indian to win on the European tour when he headed the field at last year&apos;s China Open, climbed up the world rankings to 37th place and was named his country&apos;s 2006 sportsman of the year. He was no longer the son of a famous athlete but a famous athlete in his own right - a transition that will be acknowledged in April when he becomes the first Indian to compete at the US Masters. &quot;It has been my dream to play there since I was a boy,&quot; Singh says, repeating the mantra of anyone who has received the tap on the shoulder from the men in green blazers. Needless to say, the invitation has been framed and hangs on the wall at home. Singh may be the first player from the subcontinent to tee it up at Augusta but it is safe to assume he will not be the last. Currently India has two players in the top 100 (Singh at 42 and Jyoti Randhawa at 88), while the promising Shiv Kapur has moved up to 182. If two in the top 100 does not exactly spell global domination it is at least one more than Scotland (Colin Montgomerie at 19) and there is a sound explanation as to why there have not been more top-class Indian players. Golf is a rich man&apos;s sport in India. Currently, there is one only course in the country allowing full access to the public. If you want to play you either need to become a member of a club (which is tough unless you come from the right social background) or you need to be invited to play by a member, which is hardly a practical arrangement for a promising player looking to make it as a professional. &quot;I was lucky. My father was a member of the club in our home town, Chadigarh, and I was able to cycle down there every day and play whenever I wanted,&quot; Singh says, adding that only a handful of the bigger cities have public driving ranges. &quot;Until we have driving ranges in every town and city in the country we will have a problem. We need to get to the stage where the common man can walk in off the street and try out the game.&quot; That might take longer than Singh would wish. A booming economy means there will be money available to expand the game in India but if the experience of China - where club memberships can run to \u00a3100,000-plus - is repeated there will be precious little money spent taking the game to the common man. The leisure needs of the newly wealthy classes need to be catered to and already the big names are circling. &quot;We are in negotiations about moving into India,&quot; Greg Norman said this month. The Great White Shark charges around $2m (\u00a31m) to design a course and his fee is reflected in membership fees. It is an all too familiar story, depressingly so, but Singh refuses to be pessimistic. The achievements of the current Indian professionals will provide enough inspiration for the country&apos;s young players, even if they do find it hard to find a place to play the game. &quot;There will be a wave of Indian golfers coming through over the next decade or so,&quot; Singh predicts. &quot;The big difference from the past is in the parents, who are now ready to give their kids what you could call a &apos;free go&apos; at professional golf. There is a lot of emphasis in Indian culture on education and getting your degree, then going on to a good job like doctor or in hi-tech. But the parents are seeing guys doing well in professional golf and they&apos;re saying to their children - OK, study hard but if you want to make a career in golf, go and do it.&quot;  Stars of the subcontinent Jeev Milkha Singh Age 35 Turned pro 1991 Singh, currently 42nd in the world ranking, is India&apos;s best ever player. He won his European tour card in 1997 after finishing 13th at qualifying school. Although a consistent performer on tour, his career only took off in 2006 when he won the China Open and the Volvo Masters. In April he will become the first Indian player to compete at the Masters. Arjun Atwal Age 33 Turned Pro 1995 Atwal, pictured right, was the first Indian golfer to win a European tour event, the 2002 Singapore Masters. Won again in Europe the following year before moving to the United States, where he finished seventh in the PGA tour qualifying school. The first player in the history of the Asian tour to win over $1m (\u00a3500,000) in a single season (2003). Jyoti Randhawa Age 34 Turned pro 1994 The son of a retired army general, he made his name on the Asian tour and in 2002 was the first Indian player to win its order of merit. Randhawa moved full-time on to the European tour in 2005 and had three top-10 finishes. He was in contention at the recent Dubai Desert Classic before slipping back on the closing day. He is currently ranked 11th in the European tour&apos;s order of merit. Shiv Kapur Age 25 Turned pro 2004 The youngest of the Indian contingent on the European tour, he has perhaps the most impressive pedigree. He was an outstanding amateur, winning the individual gold medal at the 2002 Asian Games. Was 2005 rookie of the year on the Asian tour.

Photograph: Mike Clarke/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile for many of us February 18 is just an ordinary Sunday, for hundreds of millions of people around the world it marks the start of the year of the pig under the Chinese lunar calendar. As well as the usual goings on -- firecrackers, huge crushes on the trains in China as hundreds of millions of migrant workers return home -- the lunar new year also brings mystical predictions as to what the next 12 months could bring. Newspapers and agencies in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere have, as ever, been busy consulting astrologers and feng shui masters for tips. Others, however, are listening to the advice of another type of expert: economists. The year of the pig is considered a notably auspicious time to have a child, especially this year, a so-called &quot;Golden Pig&quot; year which happens only once every 60 years. Children born in such a year are thought to be particularly fortunate with money and business. This is expected to spark a baby boom in mainland China, with a spin-off in wedding and other activity. Additionally, the year is considered a generally favourable time for commerce all round. Could all this help push China&apos;s already fevered economy into full-blown overheating? Although economic growth is forecast to dip below 10% this year, some warn that the country&apos;s thirst for raw materials and a booming, often speculative property market, could spell trouble. Luckily, according to experts, the year of the pig might have some effect, but not a notably significant one. &quot;My theory is that it is likely to make no more than a marginal difference,&quot; Nick Kwan, head of Asian economic research for Standard Chartered bank in Hong Kong, told me. The last lunar &quot;boom year&quot;, the year of the dragon, which began in January 2000, ended up having a minimal effect on economies around Asia, he noted, adding:  &quot;I think the Chinese economy is overheating anyway, although only in a very selective way. For it to get worse will probably take another year or two. &quot;Will the government intervene? I think definitely they will do something this year, but not so much because of the year of the pig, but because it&apos;s the year before the Olympics, and the year of the Party Congress -- these factors will be much more important for economic activity.&quot; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/feb/16/schoolsworldwide.world", "sentences": ["The essay sparked off interest from many companies - including the Singapore-based Orient Global, which decided to set aside $100m for the development of schools in deprived countries and agreed to appoint Prof Tooley as a special adviser."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-16T15:55:15Z", "title": "Professor seeks to improve schooling for poor", "tags": ["Education", "World news", "Schools", "Higher education", "UK news"], "article": "A British professor who believes the private sector should run state schools will spend the next year helping invest \u00a350m in improving schools in developing countries.

While graduates have long favoured investment banking, the dotcom boom of the late 90s saw a shift towards entrepreneurship, with all the excitement and risk that entailed. Today, many MBA graduates are finding a happy medium: private equity, which is &quot;flavour of the century&quot;, according to Eli Talmor, academic director of the Private Equity Institute at the London Business School (LBS). The sector, says Talmor, offers a unique combination: the excitement of building or turning around a company, with the money that brings, alongside the relative job security of working for an investment bank. For the uninitiated, private equity is one of the most rapidly expanding areas in the global economy. In a similar way to how venture capitalists invest in entrepreneurs, private equity firms such as Carlyle, Blackstone, Permira, Apax or 3i buy major stakes in large companies, often to finance deals such as management buyouts. With around 3 million people in the UK now working for companies owned by private equity firms, MBA students are cottoning on fast. Talmor has had to turn students away from private equity classes, and is adding more to accommodate demand. Unlike in the US, private equity in Europe has also tended to include venture capital. But whereas five or six years ago most students in Talmor&apos;s class would have been interested in venture capital, especially in the new technology sector, now private equity in the US sense, which carries greater economic clout, is more popular. Last year, 13% of those who applied to LBS wanted a career in private equity; now the number is nearly 20%. &quot;The numbers are amazing when you think this is really a small cottage industry in the global sense,&quot; says Talmor. &quot;But it is centrally located and powerful.&quot; Responding to demand, many big MBA programmes - including those at LBS and the international business school Insead in Paris and Singapore - organise private equity clubs and networking conferences. One of the organisers of the Insead&apos;s private equity conference is Gideon Glassman, a Cambridge engineering graduate with a background in strategy consultancy. He is doing an MBA at the Singapore campus and says that although there is a &quot;fashion value&quot; to private equity, the main attraction is responsibility. &quot;You really have ownership of what goes on,&quot; says the 29-year-old. Of course, an MBA even from a top business school is no guarantee of a career in private equity - especially not at the large buyout firms that many graduates target, warns Scott Moeller, director of executive education at Cass Business School in London. &quot;Private equity funds have a reputation for not being tremendous buyers of newly minted MBA graduates, whereas the investment banks do actually have a regular programme of bringing in a sizeable number of graduates,&quot; says Moeller, who previously worked at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. Talmor agrees it is highly unlikely that an MBA graduate would move directly from business school to a big-name private equity firm - though he says getting a position in other parts of Europe, or at smaller, boutique firms, is perhaps easier. &quot;There are ways to get to the biggest firms, but it has to be from the side and well planned,&quot; he adds. You might try spending time at a high-calibre advising company, consultancy or investment bank, or impressing a firm from the other side of a private equity deal - then, a few years after an MBA, opportunities might start to come. Many of the top MBA programmes also arrange private equity internships - an opportunity that LBS student Arjun Singh, who has investment banking experience at ING in New York, took. That experience helped Singh get his current job; now, in addition to his MBA, he works part-time as an associate at ESO Capital, an alternative investment fund. &quot;The school has enabled me to fulfil what I wanted to get out of my MBA, which was to steepen the slope of my career,&quot; he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/18/environment.politics", "sentences": ["Pricing in the rest of the world Singapore probably operates the world&apos;s most sophisticated road charging system, whose cost can be adjusted hourly depending on whether traffic is particularly light or heavy.", "Since its introduction in 1975, traffic levels have halved - but Singapore also has other measures to deter drivers, such as high road tax and restrictions on who can own cars."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-18T00:23:17Z", "title": "Hard sell in snarled-up  Britain", "tags": ["UK news", "Environment", "Politics", "Transport", "Congestion charging", "World news", "Road transport"], "article": "Victoria from Somerset hates traffic jams, worries about the number of cars clogging the roads and so travels to work by train: ultimately, she would love to be able to sell her car. In short, she is just the sort of public-spirited commuter to gladden the heart of a government struggling to convince Britons they need road pricing to push motorists off the roads. Unfortunately, she hates her commute. Delayed trains constantly make her late for work and sometimes overcrowding means she can&apos;t actually get on a train and, when she can, the crammed carriages are &apos;like torture&apos;. So, she told a website set up for outraged commuters on the First Great Western line, she is stumped: &apos;Should I continue to give FGW my hard-earned cash or do I jump in my car, pollute the atmosphere and clog up the roads? I need an alternative! Any suggestions?&apos; This is no longer just Victoria&apos;s problem. A report to be launched this week by Stephen Ladyman, the Transport Minister, will warn that road pricing - under which motorists would be charged to use the busiest routes at peak times - will not work without investment in public transport to create &apos;attractive alternatives&apos;. Otherwise, the report by the Social Market Foundation will argue, people will just pay to keep driving and become resentful over the extra costs they had little choice over. So can road pricing be sold to the public, even after 1.5 million of them signed the e-petition on Downing Street&apos;s own website demanding the scheme be scrapped? Options being studied by the Department for Transport to popularise it include, as The Observer reveals today, making the scheme voluntary initially. Motorists opting in would get money off fuel tax, paying their road pricing charge at the petrol pump via a swipecard that would convey information about how far they had travelled. Black boxes installed in cars to collect information about journeys would be made appealing by bolting on satellite navigation systems and pay-as-you-go insurance - allowing low-mileage drivers to pay lower premiums. Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, suggested that the government could even rebrand road pricing as UK Drive Time to advertise potential benefits: &apos;You would then [show] that actually this system does work, it&apos;s not a big brother, it&apos;s not extra tax, and people will see the benefits.&apos; This week the Prime Minister and the Transport Secretary, Douglas Alexander, will begin a fightback over road pricing - including emailing e-petition signatories to rebut what they believe are scaremongering inaccuracies in the petition. For instance, campaigners against road pricing claim the technology used for charging will cost \u00a3200 and represent an &apos;attack on freedom&apos; by tracking drivers. The government will point out there has been no decision on the technology to be used. On Monday, Ken Livingstone will formally extend London&apos;s \u00a38-a-day congestion charge, the most ambitious attempt to tackle gridlock so far, to the west. He enjoys pointing out that critics predicted that his charge would be a disaster: instead, congestion was cut by 30 per cent in its first year and he is hailed for his vision. There is evidence his charge is losing traction. Figures released last week suggest the extension will bring only a 4 per cent further reduction in traffic, with most drivers choosing to pay and stay on the roads. Yet Britain cannot keep careering on towards gridlock. Last week the DfT admitted road traffic had risen another five billion vehicle kilometres, a 12 per cent rise since 1997. The Commons transport select committee concluded that, far from making progress on congestion targets, the department was going backwards. The former British Airways chief commissioned by Gordon Brown to review transport policy warned that by the year 2025 congestion would cost the economy \u00a322 billion in lost time. But would national road pricing, Rod Eddington&apos;s favoured solution, reverse the tide - or just buy time before roads snarl up again? And is there really no alternative? The French may not be famed for their saintly driving habits, but Paris last week entered the traffic debate by promising to cut congestion by an ambitious 40 per cent - without making anyone pay a penny in congestion charges. Instead there will be more pedestrianisation and cycle lanes, physically squeezing cars out; trams will link main rail stations, and a new high-speed rail &apos;ringroad&apos; will be built around the city. Cars will be made less welcome, but public transport made an easier alternative. Denis MacShane, the former Foreign Minister, argues Britain could learn from such ideas: &apos;Road pricing can play a part, but I just think we should use every tool in the box.&apos; Other critics suggest the government should control traffic by ditching policies that perversely encourage car journeys, such as letting children apply to schools outside the local catchment area or permitting out-of-town retail parks. The anti-road pricing group No Tolls, which helped galvanise support for the petition, lobbies for road building instead. The DFT says it has tried managing traffic better and investing more, and that it is not enough. One problem is keeping up with inexorably rising demand. Last week rail operators said passenger numbers rose sharply last year to &apos;well over a billion&apos; and that up to 130,000 commuters a day would be forced to stand on their journey to work by 2014. &apos;At the end of that, you have to say that, if congestion is going to grow, you have got to find solutions,&apos; says one DfT official. The department hopes the 10 areas across the country, from Bristol to Durham, which have bid for government funds to investigate introducing forms of local road charging can now convince the public it could work. Only one, Greater Manchester, is so far firmly committed to going ahead - prompting speculation that some areas could use the cash to fund planning and public transport improvements, but back out of charging. A spokesman for the West Midlands bid, one of the most promising large trial areas, said road charging was one of three options being considered, with a decision due in July Ministers are now calling on those who backed road pricing initially -including the AA and RAC - to defend it. Green campaigners are discussing a rival e-petition backing road pricing - a gift to the opposition if it flopped. &apos;People don&apos;t often sign positive petitions,&apos; said Estelle Taylor, spokesman for campaign group Transport 2000, who says those favouring road pricing all have different reasons for supporting it. The problem for pro-road pricers is that there are too many questions they cannot yet answer. Transport ministers - or rather the Treasury - haven&apos;t decided what the cost should be, whether profits should all be returned to drivers through cuts in road tax or be spent partly on public transport, and how cars should be tracked or which roads covered. &apos;There is a debate about what we could do, but it always ends up with &quot;but it&apos;s so far in the future&quot;,&apos; said a senior departmental source, who says the answers will have to wait until it is clearer how high taxes or spending might be by 2015. Faced with gaps in the proposals, voters imagine the worst - egged on by the antis. Much of the current row relies on a 2004 feasibility study which suggested fitting the nation&apos;s 33 million cars, vans and lorries with tracking devices and charging up to \u00a31.40 on the busiest roads - raising \u00a310 billion. Yet that paper also predicted that much more modest schemes - charging up to 32p per mile, or limited to a handful of big urban centres and trunk roads - could still significantly reduce congestion. It also made clear rural roads could be free to drive on, while only 0.5 per cent of drivers would pay the top rate - crucial elements drowned out in the fury of last week&apos;s debate. But with Middle England&apos;s media cheerleaders now on the warpath, would two-thirds of drivers still tell pollsters, as they did in 2004, that they would accept road pricing if taxes did not rise overall? The Blairite think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, which has studied public attitudes to charging, found three main public objections. &apos;People felt they already did everything they could to avoid traffic, so how would paying to drive make any difference?&apos; says Jenny Bird, who led the research. &apos;Secondly, people perceived it as a stealth tax, and the third reason was loss of freedom - people felt the government would be telling them where and when they could drive.&apos; The trickiest argument is the stealth tax one. For even a revenue-neutral scheme to counter charges of raising money by the backdoor would still have individual winners and losers who could feel aggrieved. Rural drivers could profit from road tax being slashed and never travel on tolled main roads, emerging richer overall: school-run mothers with no choice but to travel at peak times could end up worse off, even with cheaper road tax. Which is one reason why the Social Market Foundation report argues that the key to public acceptance is for tolls not to simply vanish into Treasury coffers. It found little to choose in popularity between revenue-neutral schemes and revenue-raisers where money is earmarked for public transport - an option 66 per cent of voters told a DfT survey they would support. Or put simply, if Victoria from Somerset - along with all the other tens of thousands of people who stand every day on their train to work - could actually get a seat on a brand-new, clean train which ran on time, she might give up her car without feeling overly resentful. And Britain could reap the benefit. Pricing in the rest of the world Singapore probably operates the world&apos;s most sophisticated road charging system, whose cost can be adjusted hourly depending on whether traffic is particularly light or heavy. Drivers use prepaid smart cards to enter the busy downtown district, with tolls costing about a pound during the morning rush hour and half as much for the 30 minutes on either side. Since its introduction in 1975, traffic levels have halved - but Singapore also has other measures to deter drivers, such as high road tax and restrictions on who can own cars. The citizens of Stockholm, Sweden, recently voted in a referendum to back charges of up to about \u00a34.20, varying according to the time of day, to enter the city. Drivers must have direct debit accounts to pay. Charges were introduced for a trial period, during which the traffic jams eased, then the trial stopped while the vote was held: the roads clogged up again. It is said to have reduced traffic by about 20 per cent; but Swedes are already more used to high taxes than Britons. Road pricing in Germany involves a road user charge for lorries: the system uses GPS satellite technology to trace lorries and mobile technology to collect the money. Several other European countries - including France, Switzerland and Hungary - operate motorway tolls under a &apos;vignette&apos; system, where the driver must have a prepaid sticker displayed on the windscreen to use the road. Seattle, USA, began experimenting with a voluntary road charging scheme two years ago in which cars were fitted with satellite tracking devices, showing what the toll per mile was at the time on the road they were approaching. Volunteers were given free credits for the amount of tolls they would have been expected to pay, based on their previous road usage: if they used the charged roads less, they could keep the surplus, up to \u00a3100. The trial has not yet produced conclusive findings.

We do, of course, already have a very effective system of paying as you use the road - as Jackie Ashley implicitly acknowledges when she says drivers &quot;feel overtaxed and overcharged&quot;. It is called fuel duty, which, with its associated VAT, raises \u00a330bn for the government. (Other taxes on road use, such as vehicle excise duty, VAT on new cars and company car tax raise another \u00a320 billion.) A tax on fuel consumption means that the more you use the roads, the more you pay; and if the roads are congested, you pay even more as you use more fuel. Fuel duty has the advantage that it encourages the use of smaller cars, more efficient engines, better driving (the less you step on the gas, the more mpg you get) and alternative fuels. Road pricing as proposed cannot readily do any of this and will mainly have the effect of driving some less well-off drivers, who mainly use smaller cars, off the roads. To the extent that tolls will vary from one road to another (it is suggested that motorways will have higher toll rates), then drivers will tend to divert on to less suitable roads. Road pricing will be the greatest waste of money ever. The consultants appointed by the government said that road pricing would cost between \u00a310bn and \u00a362bn to implement and a further \u00a35bn a year to run. Judging by the experience of the relatively crude London charge scheme, the actual costs would be at the top end of this range or higher. Our estimate is that the annual cost will average about \u00a310bn. This is more than the \u00a37bn that they spend on the road system each year, and it would not yield one extra mile of road or help pay for any improvements to public transport. After all this expense, would it work anyway? A year after the London charge was introduced; Transport for London produced figures saying that &quot;congestion&quot; was down to &quot;30 to 33%&quot;. But if you look at the TfL figures, what this meant was that, instead of taking 20 minutes to drive across the zone, after the introduction of the charge, it would take 18 minutes 20 seconds. Even that modest initial increase in speed seems to have reduced. London Assembly member Angie Bray, after seeing more recent traffic figures, said, &quot;Londoners have been badly let down. The congestion charge is a charge on congestion that we once got for free.&quot; This experience is not unique to London. Singapore has a more sophisticated Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system which it has been suggested that London and other cities in Britain should eventually copy. The toll has been in place since 1998. It varies according to the road and is at its highest in peak periods. But last Friday, it was reported that one Singapore MP (Low Thia Khiang) asked in their parliament: &quot;Is the ERP just a means to squeeze money from the motorists who face the same jam?&quot; It is perhaps not surprising that tolls seem to have little effect on the volume of traffic on the road at busy periods. Most of the vehicles are on the road at that time because they have no choice. The main limiting factor is the congestion itself: if peak period congestion reduces, then drivers on more flexible hours will move back to the peak. Likewise, except in the case of accidents, you can never get permanent &quot;gridlock&quot;, as drivers will avoid it. By coincidence, there was real gridlock in Pennsylvania last week caused by very heavy falls of snow. What did the governor do to help get the traffic flowing again? He suspended the tolls on the turnpike. The Department for Transport&apos;s own research into how drivers would react if we had road pricing was quietly published last March. It was called &quot;Consumer Behaviour and Pricing Structures: Final Report on Qualitative Research&quot;, and the research was carried out by the Institute for Transport Studies at Leeds University. The report said that they had found that attitudes to motoring costs differ from those to other expenses, that drivers rarely consider the costs of individual journeys, and that motoring expenses were widely perceived as unavoidable periodic events. It also said that drivers preferred a system of fuel duty to other forms of road charging. In a perverse way, maybe that is why those who want some form of tolls are pushing for it! If we do get road pricing, then how will they ever enforce it? There are already 2.2m unlicensed vehicles evading excise duty and, in many cases, insurance. It will be very difficult to charge unlicensed drivers, so how many will join them or otherwise make sure that any metering device does not work? What should we do instead of road pricing? For a start, we need better roads. The anti-roads lobby says that if you do this, the roads will just clog up. Restricting road space below what is needed is the same as suggesting that the way to cut hospital waiting lists is to close some wards or start making heavy charges for treatment. If there is a shortage of beans on the shelf in the supermarket, then when you put more beans on the shelves, you will get more sales. But if you put even more on, you will not sell even more beans. Instead of improving the roads, what is happening is that the existing road space is being reduced and traffic artificially slowed; they then say that they need road pricing because of the congestion. It isn&apos;t all just a case of improving roads. There are 1,001 other things that could be done. This includes encouraging walking, free bus services for children and the retired, park and ride schemes, promoting car-sharing, more flexible working, and tele-working. These all require effort and some spending, but this should come from general taxes, not from road users who already pay a net \u00a340bn to the government. The politicians should avoid killing the goose that lays this golden egg for them, and, if nothing else, they must at least do what they did in Edinburgh - and let the people decide."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/20/art.india", "sentences": ["Built in Singapore for $100,000, the installation is so large it took five people to set it up."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-20T10:48:11Z", "title": "Randeep Ramesh on Subodh Gupta, the Damien Hirst of Delhi", "tags": ["Art", "India", "World news", "Culture", "Art and design", "Damien Hirst"], "article": "Through the haze of frontier dust where New Delhi fades into scrub and grazing land lies the low-slung, white-walled home of the country&apos;s most coveted conceptual art. Inside the workshop, a sculpture of huge brass pots hangs from the ceiling. On the wall is a shimmering canvas of a stainless steel urn. Nearby sits a 5ft metal bucket. The works&apos; creator is Subodh Gupta, the current darling of the booming Indian modern art market. Like a subcontinental version of Marcel Duchamp, who exhibited a public urinal in the early 20th century, Gupta takes everyday objects as &quot;ready-made art&quot;. Pots, pans and squat stools from his childhood all recall the artist&apos;s humble, rural roots. &quot;All these things were part of the way I grew up. They are used in the rituals and ceremonies that were part of my childhood. Indians either remember them from their youth, or they want to remember them.&quot; Perhaps most striking to western eyes is his use of cow dung. The 42-year-old has made installations out of manure patties, kitchen fuel for millions of Indian country homes, and painted with dung \u00e0 la Chris Ofili. In a nine-minute video, Pure, the artist stands covered in thick layer of bovine excreta that is slowly hosed off in a shower. Gupta says he wanted to play with meanings of &quot;purity&quot;. &quot;In Indian villages, cow shit is used for spiritual cleaning like an antiseptic. But this is not true of today&apos;s [Indian] cities. I wanted to show that.&quot; Despite dwelling on domestic themes, the artist has become a mainstay of the big international art fairs and has exhibited in the Venice Biennale, London&apos;s Frieze and shows in Moscow, Miami, Lille and Japan. As a sculptor, painter, installation-maker and video producer, Gupta is seen as the enfant terrible of the Indian art scene, a Damien Hirst of New Delhi. Last year, his work Across Seven Seas, a room-sized airport conveyor belt cast in aluminium, topped with 30 metal suitcases and bundles, sold for \u00a3550,000 to a German collector at the Basel art fair. Perhaps Gupta&apos;s most famous fan is Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, the French billionaire and biggest shareholder in Christie&apos;s, who bought a one-tonne skull crafted out of aluminium pots and pans, after one of his curators spotted it in a remarkable show at Paris&apos;s Eglise Saint-Bernard church last October. Gupta says the monumental work, entitled A Very Hungry God, was a &quot;one-off, unique&quot;. &quot;I cannot reproduce that. The kitchen stuff is a phase I am going through, but a piece like that is not going to be done again,&quot; he says. The British public have got a chance to sample Gupta&apos;s art at Gateshead&apos;s Baltic gallery, with a newly installed sculpture of a &quot;kitchen city&quot;, which sees a stainless-steel sushi belt transporting metal bowls around a landscape of cooking utensils. Built in Singapore for $100,000, the installation is so large it took five people to set it up. Gupta is among a generation of young Indian artists whose commentary tells of a country on the move, fuelled by boiling economic growth and a more materialistic mindset. Despite reflecting these changes in their art, the new generation of painters and sculptors are themselves part of the boom. Last September, Christie&apos;s modern Indian art auction saw record sales of almost $18m (\u00a39.5m). The recent spurt in prices has seen even newcomers such as painter Surendran Nair picking up $250,000 for a work. Just who is buying the art reveals a novel trend. Indian-born but foreign-based Indians, especially those who are self-made, see the new art as a way of reconfirming their ethnic identity and as an opportunity to move up into the rarefied world of elitist arts. The result is rapid inflation in art prices. Rajiv Chaudhri, a New York-based Indian hedge-fund manager who stunned a crowd at Christie&apos;s in late 2005, by paying $1.6m for a painting by the 80-year-old Indian artist Tyeb Mehta. The work, Mahisasura, a 1997 rendering of the buffalo-demon of Hindu mythology, was the first time a contemporary Indian painting had crossed the million-dollar mark. The new valuations are not just down to new Indian money and a wealthy Indian diaspora intent on rediscovering their heritage, but also to the internet. A number of online auctions have connected once-obscure artists with a hungry audience. &quot;The pioneer of this model is Saffron- art.com, which runs weekend auctions for the NRI [non-resident Indian] community who buy with their ears, not their eyes,&quot; says Peter Nagy, who left New York for New Delhi a decade ago to start up Nature Morte art gallery. &quot;These guys come to India once or twice a year, but don&apos;t have time to buy art. So they sit in their computer rooms in New Jersey, pushing up prices in New Delhi. Right now, prices are going through the ceiling.&quot; Saffronart.com burst on to the scene with a $1.5m sale of a work by Francis Newton Souza, one of the older generation of Indian painters, in December 2005. What we are seeing, says Yamini Mehta, head of Christie&apos;s modern and contemporary Indian art division, is a pattern of sales similar to the other ancient, large-scale Asian culture: China. Chinese art grew from a curio item in auctions in the 80s to the point where Chinese painters now sell work routinely for half a million dollars. &quot;We are at the beginning of Indian art. Chinese art has been in western galleries for a long time,&quot; says Mehta. She points out that the Indian auctions a decade ago yielded just $800,000. &quot;This year the figure is $42m. India is more diverse than China. But he prices are definitely following [the same] course.&quot; Subodh Gupta owes his rise in part to Pierre Huber, a Geneva gallery-owner who spotted that Chinese work was the next big thing in contemporary art. He also saw the potential for Indian art and Gupta, and quickly signed up the young artist. Mehta says what is remarkable about the Indian market is that you can still pick up bargains. &quot;You cannot buy the best Picasso at the moment because it is in a private collection. But you can pick up a MF Hussain because private collectors are only just starting.&quot; There are signs that a new crop of visual art museums is appearing in India&apos;s new metropolises, designed by Indian collectors who model themselves on cultural impresarios such as Charles Saatchi. More than $500m is expected to flow into the market when the half-dozen private museums currently being built by India&apos;s new elite start acquiring work. These new centres will preserve and present Indian contemporary art projects. In a warehouse on the edge of Delhi&apos;s southern rim is the Devi Foundation, which aims to replicate New York&apos;s temple of modern art, the Dia Foundation. The brainchild of mother-and-son team Lekha and Anupam Poddar, who also own designer hotels, the foundation aims to become India&apos;s main showcase for art. Gupta&apos;s work litters the Poddars&apos; collection: they own a life-sized, pink fibreglass statue of a grazing cow, and a huge globe made of milk cans. They have also commissioned a cow-dung painting. &quot;These are incredibly sophisticated people who have travelled all over the world and educated themselves about contemporary art in Europe and the US,&quot; says Nagy, who has also backed Gupta&apos;s creations. &quot;They came back here and realised such a talent like Subodh was just doing the craziest shit. It is both visionary and a no-brainer&quot;. \u00b7 Subodh Gupta: Silk Route is at Baltic, Gateshead (0191-478 1922), until April 29."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2007/feb/20/plymouthgetsg", "sentences": ["Sounds fascinating, though - and reminds me of recent attempts to create real-world versions of Pac-Man in New York and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-20T11:07:51Z", "title": "Plymouth gets Gran Turismo art", "tags": ["Culture", "Games", "Technology"], "article": " Public art commissions can be expensive and indulgent affairs, but sometimes they&apos;re fascinating and &apos;challenging&apos; - in a good way.

Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, which has recruited 300 international students to its Piccadilly site, will be the first foreign, non-US university to open a branch in the UK. Its aim, says Natasha Aziz, manager of international relations in the London campus, is &quot;to produce global graduates with a wider perspective&quot;. The campus is just one example of the many new challenges that British higher education, along with fellow institutions overseas, is facing in the increasingly competitive and globalised market described by delegate after delegate at the summit. &quot;We are going to have to reinvent universities, reinvent academics and reinvent the students,&quot; John Hearn, deputy vicechancellor (international) at the University of Sydney told delegates. &quot;Change is very much with us and will be part of us for the next 20 years at least.&quot; The rapidly developing economies and middle classes of China and India, all hungry for top-level education, are the reasons for much of this change. According to Hearn, at least five of China&apos;s top universities are slated to be in the top 50 in the world over the next few years. But with 60% of the world&apos;s population expected to be in Asia within the next 20 years, other Asian countries, including Malaysia, pose plenty of challenges too. Kevin Van Cauter, distance learning adviser at the British Council, said there was no sign the global education market had peaked. Indeed it was expected to continue to grow long term at a constant rate experienced by all countries, although at different levels. &quot;Established markets are changing dramatically,&quot; he said. The biggest change is the extent of global student mobility, with more prepared to travel across countries and continents to study, or to study foreign degrees by distance learning. But while growth in the number of students travelling to traditional overseas markets such as the UK, US and Australia is slowing, education hubs are developing fast in other, new areas. Students from elsewhere in the far east are now travelling to China or Malaysia rather than the west in search of an international education, delivered either by state, or increasingly private, institutions. This does not necessarily mean they want to study Chinese university degrees. Many still like a UK or US qualification but they don&apos;t feel they need to go to the UK or US to get it. Van Cauter said it is expected that by 2010 there will be more students studying for UK qualifications in their own country than coming to the UK to study. Already, 50,000 to 70,000 students in Singapore are studying on UK courses. Even if they do come to the UK they tend to stay for shorter periods than they used to, increasingly preferring to take one-year masters programmes rather than full undergraduate degrees. The downside of this for universities is that they can never relax about recruitment. Every year demands an international recruitment drive if numbers are to be kept steady. And already the rate of growth in non-EU students in the UK is slowing, down from 11% in 2003/04 to 6% in 2004/05. When the prime minster launched the first phase of his Initiative for International Education in 1999, the focus was on recruitment, with a target of increasing the number of non-EU international students studying in the UK by 75,000 by the year 2005 - a target that was easily exceeded. The second phase, launched last year, aims for another 100,000 students in further and higher education but also emphasises collaboration and partnerships, with more exchange of students and staff, research projects, courses and degrees. Distance learning opportunities Van Cauter told delegates that universites&apos; relationships with institutions overseas were becoming crucial as students often made their choice of UK institution based on their knowledge of partner institutions in their own countries. But he also suggested that new trends in transnational education, such as international collaborations and distance learning opportunities, could themselves be encouraging students to stay closer to home. For hard-pressed civil servants this may be no bad thing. Increased demand from student applicants, combined with fears about terrorism means the visa system is stretched, and it has become no longer possible to interview every applicant. Demand from students for visas was up last year by 15% and 194,000 student visas were issued. But the refusal rate is high: 40% for students compared to an overall rate of 20%. For students coming from certain countries, the refusal rate is higher still. Glyn Williams, director, business development, UK visas at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, acknowledged that this had sometimes brought officials into conflict with institutions that had accepted the students&apos; applications and therefore felt their professional integrity was being questioned. But he insisted these fears were unjustified. &quot;Entry to the UK as a student is something of a magnet for those who want to come here to work or live rather than be a student,&quot; he said. Over the next couple of years the system is due to change, anyway, to one in which universities or employers will need to register with the Home Office and buy certificates of sponsorship for every student or employee coming from outside the EU. While this will place more of a burden on the sponsor, Williams said it should also be a more transparent process for both applicants and universities. He said the new system should be in place for the 2009 intake. Universities are still waiting to hear the details of these proposals but a spokesperson for Universities UK said it was aware of what was likely to emerge from the review of the current Voluntary Vetting Scheme. &quot;In general, the principles outlined for the new scheme seem appropriate,&quot; he said. Williams said the scheme was designed to recognise that, in the UK&apos;s view, the important thing was not just to get in more students. &quot;We want to get in what are, from our point of view, the right kind of students.&quot; This is another element of the new global higher education market. Competition is not simply becoming fiercer over the quantity of students; countries are also fighting over their quality. Greg Farrington, president of Lehigh University, Pennsylvania, said he wanted to see Britain get all the students it wanted, so long as the best came to the US. For this, America is prepared to pay. While Britain tends to see foreign students as a cash cow, in the US they are usually a net cost because they are often less wealthy than home students and therefore demand subsidised fees. But Farrington said it was still well worth it and not only so that the brightest graduates return to their home countries with a benevolent view of America - &quot;able to make a distinction between US people and US foreign policy&quot;, as he put it. It is above all for the benefit of home students and the desire &quot;to create on campus a diverse community of students who learn from each other&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/21/obituaries.readersobituaries", "sentences": ["In 1952 she married my father, the oboist Paul Mosby, and they spent two years in Singapore, where she performed for Radio Malaya and the BBC and was amused to find the ex-pat cast insisting on &quot;dressing for the performance&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-21T00:07:44Z", "title": "Obituary: Gwen Mosby", "tags": [], "article": "My mother, Gwen Mosby, who has died aged 80 of ovarian cancer, began her acting career despite a facially disfiguring tram accident, which left her wondering whether she would ever work.

This petition was posted shortly before we published the Eddington Study, an independent review of Britain&apos;s transport network. This study set out long-term challenges and options for our transport network. It made clear that congestion is a major problem to which there is no easy answer. One aspect of the study was highlighting how road pricing could provide a solution to these problems and that advances in technology put these plans within our reach. Of course it would be ten years or more before any national scheme was technologically, never mind politically, feasible. That is the backdrop to this issue. As my response makes clear, this is not about imposing &quot;stealth taxes&quot; or introducing &quot;Big Brother&quot; surveillance. This is a complex subject, which cannot be resolved without a thorough investigation of all the options, combined with a full and frank debate about the choices we face at a local and national level. That&apos;s why I hope this detailed response will address your concerns and set out how we intend to take this issue forward. I see this email as the beginning, not the end of the debate, and the links below provide an opportunity for you to take it further. But let me be clear straight away: we have not made any decision about national road pricing. Indeed we are simply not yet in a position to do so. We are, for now, working with some local authorities that are interested in establishing local schemes to help address local congestion problems. Pricing is not being forced on any area, but any schemes would teach us more about how road pricing would work and inform decisions on a national scheme. And funds raised from these local schemes will be used to improve transport in those areas. One thing I suspect we can all agree is that congestion is bad. It&apos;s bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services. It affects people&apos;s quality of life. And it is bad for the environment. That is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any Government. Congestion is predicted to increase by 25% by 2015. This is being driven by economic prosperity. There are 6 million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997, and predictions are that this trend will continue. Part of the solution is to improve public transport, and to make the most of the existing road network. We have more than doubled investment since 1997, spending \u00a32.5 billion this year on buses and over \u00a34 billion on trains - helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades. And we&apos;re committed to sustaining this investment, with over \u00a3140 billion of investment planned between now and 2015. We&apos;re also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example, over 1000 Highways Agency Traffic Officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving. But all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse. So we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion. This is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to, and not just in the UK. For example, road pricing schemes are already in operation in Italy, Norway and Singapore, and others, such as the Netherlands, are developing schemes. Towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion. One option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked. Given the forecast growth in traffic, doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer, and be less reliable. I think that would be bad for businesses, individuals and the environment. And the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra \u00a322 billion in wasted time in England by 2025, of which \u00a310-12 billion would be the direct cost on businesses. A second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion. We could, of course, add new lanes to our motorways, widen roads in our congested city centres, and build new routes across the countryside. Certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story. That is why we are widening the M25, M1 and M62. But I think people agree that we cannot simply build more and more roads, particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity. Tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly, requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health, or increases in taxes. If I tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as \u00a330m, you&apos;ll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail. That is why I believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion. It would not be in anyone&apos;s interests, especially those of motorists, to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further. It has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns. But any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be. Existing technologies, such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes, may well be able to play a role here, by ensuring that the Government doesn&apos;t hold information about where vehicles have been. But there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology. Just as new medical technology is changing the NHS, so there will be changes in the transport sector. Our aim is to relieve traffic jams, not create a &quot;Big Brother&quot; society. I know many people&apos;s biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a &quot;stealth tax&quot; on motorists. It won&apos;t. Road pricing is about tackling congestion. Clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing, there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation. This could mean that those who use their car less, or can travel at less congested times, in less congested areas, for example in rural areas, would benefit from lower motoring costs overall. Those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more. But those are decisions for the future. At this stage, when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme, stories about possible costs are simply not credible, since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated, never mind decided. Before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme, we know that we have to have a system that works. A system that respects our privacy as individuals. A system that is fair. I fully accept that we don&apos;t have all the answers yet. That is why we are not rushing headlong into a national road pricing scheme. Before we take any decisions there would be further consultations. The public will, of course, have their say, as will Parliament. We want to continue this debate, so that we can build a consensus around the best way to reduce congestion, protect the environment and support our businesses.

It&apos;s bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services. It affects people&apos;s quality of life. And it is bad for the environment. That is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any government. Congestion is predicted to increase by 25% by 2015. This is being driven by economic prosperity. There are 6m more vehicles on the road now than in 1997, and predictions are that this trend will continue. Part of the solution is to improve public transport, and to make the most of the existing road network. We have more than doubled investment since 1997, spending \u00a32.5bn this year on buses and over \u00a34bn on trains- helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades. And we&apos;re committed to sustaining this investment, with over \u00a3140bn of investment planned between now and 2015. We&apos;re also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example, over 1,000 Highways Agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving. But all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse. So we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion. This is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to, and not just in the UK. For example, road pricing schemes are already in operation in Italy, Norway and in Singapore, and others, such as the Netherlands, are developing schemes. Towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion. One option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked. Given the forecast growth in traffic, doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer, and be less reliable. I think that would be bad for businesses , individuals and the environment. And the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra \u00a322bn in wasted time in England by 2025, of which \u00a310-12bn would be the direct cost on businesses. A second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion. We could, of course, add new lanes to our motorways, widen roads in our congested city centres, and build new routes across the countryside. Certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story. That is why we are widening the M25, M1 and M62. But I think people agree that we cannot simply build more and more roads, particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity. Tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly, requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health, or increases in taxes. If I tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as \u00a330m, you&apos;ll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail. That is why I believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion. It would not be in anyone&apos;s interests, especially those of motorists, to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further. It has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns. But any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be. Existing technologies, such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes, may well be able to play a role here, by ensuring that the government doesn&apos;t hold information about where vehicles have been. But there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology. Just as new medical technology is changing the NHS, so there will be changes in the transport sector. Our aim is to relieve traffic jams, not create a &quot;Big Brother&quot; society. I know many people&apos;s biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a &quot;stealth tax&quot; on motorists. It won&apos;t. Road pricing is about tackling congestion. Clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing, there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation. This could mean that those who use their car less, or can travel at less congested times, in less congested areas, for example in rural areas, would benefit from lower motoring costs overall. Those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more. But those are decisions for the future. At this stage, when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme, stories about possible costs are simply not credible, since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated, never mind decided. Before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme, we know that we have to have a system that works. A system that respects our privacy as individuals. A system that is fair. I fully accept that we don&apos;t have all the answers yet. That is why we are not rushing headlong into a national road pricing scheme. Before we take any decisions there would be further consultations. The public will, of course, have their say, as will parliament. We want to continue this debate, so that we can build a consensus around the best way to reduce congestion, protect the environment and support our businesses.

It went unnoticed at the time. But for Mr Livingstone&apos;s opponents, fuming still at the international &quot;oil for brooms&quot; deal he signed this week with Hugo Chavez, of Venezuela, and smarting over his claim that the mayoralty is as much about international diplomacy as municipal stewardship, it should now be taken as a sign that things are only going to get worse. The Guardian has learned that officials at City Hall, central London, have begun &quot;scoping&quot; work on the prospects for international cooperation between the capital and Brazil. Mr Livingstone&apos;s team are concentrating in the short term on relations with China, India and Russia as well as on the nuts and bolts of the deal with Venezuela. But Brazil has also been identified as another rising force with which London must make common cause. &quot;Lula thinks London is a very important place and we are looking closely at the situation there,&quot; a source said. &quot;It may be four or five years down the road but Brazil has many things going for it. It is a major manufacturer of cars and steel. It is also the biggest producer of ethanol, which will be a key commodity in the fight against climate change.&quot; London considers itself well placed to provide municipal consultancy. &quot;If you went to one of the big consultancy firms and said &apos;let&apos;s rebuild a city&apos; the cost would be colossal. We have over 100 years experience of running a successful city,&quot; the source said. Unveiling his Venezuela deal this week, the mayor trumpeted the benefits for 250,000 poor Londoners, who will get half-priced bus and tram travel using the \u00a316m saving via the receipt of cheap oil from Hugo Chavez. But Mr Livingstone also said the deal was part of a strategy and wider philosophy. &quot;We will work with cities right the way across the world. People see themselves as partners on one planet and we either save the world together or die together.&quot; He said the notion particularly applied to the response to climate change. Mr Livingstone believes that for a city like London international diplomacy by the mayor is a matter of necessity. Next week, he plays host to the mayors of Paris, Moscow, Berlin and Beijing. The leaders of other devolved administrations also venture further afield. Last year Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first minister, went to China, Dubai, Brittany, Brussels and Latvia. Jack McConnell, Scotland&apos;s first minister, took six foreign trips between April 2005 and 2006, including Canada, Australia, Malawi, China and Belgium. London&apos;s mayor has been abroad 20 times since 2004, on visits including tips to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, Singapore, and Moscow. Last year he famously tried to visit President Chavez in Caracas but returned home because the Venezuelan leader could not see him. London has &quot;embassies&quot; in Brussels, Beijing and Shanghai with offices in Mumbai and New Delhi due to open in November, all of which the mayor claims are cost effective. &quot;We don&apos;t have a foreign policy,&quot; a source said. &quot;We have a domestic policy that requires us to have these international links.&quot; But Mr Livingstone&apos;s macro approach to the job of municipal leadership is controversial and the Venezuela deal has particularly infuriated his critics. Hours after the accord was signed, the London Assembly announced an investigation. Members have also been forcing his administration to justify the travel bill. The policy also carries the risk of guilt by association, particularly for a mayor who so guards his political reputation. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delano\u00eb, is a political ally but the mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, who signed a partnership agreement with Mr Livingstone, is seen by some as a rightwing nationalist. President Chavez is also both loved and loathed. Referring to his relations with Venezuela&apos;s media, this week&apos;s Economist magazine accused the president of &quot;silencing dissenting views little by little&quot;. Angie Bray, Tory leader at City Hall, said the international links required scrutiny. &quot;I can see the logic of deals with major cities but what has happened with Venezuela is basically the politics of the pirate. What next? Cheap rice from Cambodia? Cheap cigars from Havana? In any event, I am not sure people in London would think the mayor and his team run our services so efficiently that they have time to run them anywhere else.&quot; She added: &quot;He wasn&apos;t elected to have a foreign policy. He has very specific areas of responsibility.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/25/business.london", "sentences": ["David Sharpe, managing director of the London Eye, which is now owned by Dubai International Capital, is leaving today to visit Shanghai, Kuala Lumpar and Singapore to discuss the possibility."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-25T00:05:28Z", "title": "Revealed: secret plan for West End convention centre", "tags": ["Business", "Business travel", "London holidays", "London"], "article": "Secret plans by London Mayor Ken Livingstone to create central London&apos;s first purpose-built international convention centre (ICC) have been uncovered by The Observer. The spectacular proposal would see a world class 5,000-seat facility built on land around Centre Point along New Oxford Street in the West End . The plan would involve persuading the landlord of Centre Point, tycoon Ardeshir Naghshineh, to convert the listed tower into a luxury hotel. A convention centre would boost the West End&apos;s retail and leisure sector and help regenerate Oxford Street. Though one of the world&apos;s most famous shopping streets, its east side in particular has grown markedly tatty. Although Livingstone&apos;s staff have been working on the plans in secret for years, it is understood that the four landowners affected have been sounded out. There are still plenty of obstacles to be overcome if the convention centre is to be built. Ultimately, the mayor could purchase the land compulsorily to push the plan through, but that is an option of last resort. Apart from former civil engineer Naghshineh, a key landowner is Lawrence Kirschel, a former business partner of Paul Raymond who has a fortune estimated at more than \u00a3200m. James Bidwell, chief executive of Visit London, the city&apos;s official tourist body, said: &apos;A central location for a convention centre is attractive because it would have direct benefit to the retail, restaurant and theatres. This would be a tremendous asset for our tourism economy.&apos; The plan would take years to bring to life. Insiders say it is unlikely to be built until after the 2012 Olympics. Plans for a new international convention centre come as London&apos;s tourism sector has enjoyed a record year. Separately, the firm behind the London Eye, near Waterloo on the South Bank, has been approached to manage similar projects in several major world cities. David Sharpe, managing director of the London Eye, which is now owned by Dubai International Capital, is leaving today to visit Shanghai, Kuala Lumpar and Singapore to discuss the possibility. The London Eye will soon receive its 25 millionth customer. The Eye&apos;s owner is keen to boost revenue.

A woman chooses a heavy coat from the cloakroom of a gloomy old Scottish manor. She walks outside and down the river path, &apos;listening to the waters roar and shush&apos;, wondering why people on the estate call the river a &apos;burn&apos;. She picks up stones as she goes and places them in the coat&apos;s poacher&apos;s pockets. Only slowly do we realise that this woman is intending to drown herself in the loch. As she steps into the freezing water, her thoughts and fears seep into the narrative until &apos;she walks off the hidden underwater cliff with a tiny surprised cry, bitten off, and vanishes immediately under the brown waves&apos;. The woman is the mother of Alban McGill, the novel&apos;s central character. The shockwaves of her suicide, which occurred when Alban was two, can be felt throughout the story, but nothing else in the book comes close to equalling the lyrical force of this one short scene. Alban is now 35. He has severed all links with his extensive, troublesome, wealthy family, the Wopulds, &apos;the games family, the people with their name plastered all over the board of Empire! (still the UK&apos;s bestselling board game, by some margin)&apos;. He is shacked up with a bunch of amiable junkies in a squalid Perth flat when his cousin Fielding finally tracks him down to inform him that the family business is to be sold to an American corporation. The news is enough to lure Alban back into the fold and, in the process, to stir up some painful memories from his past: a thwarted teenage love affair with his beautiful cousin Sophie and the still-obscure circumstances surrounding his mother&apos;s death. This is familiar Banks territory: dark secrets spreading rot through the heart of a powerful clan; forbidden adolescent passions; and an anxiety, evident in his last novel, Dead Air, about the catastrophic state of the world and America&apos;s contribution to it. Alban has a lot to say on this. He opposes the sale and expresses to the executives of Spraint Corp his views on American foreign policy. Far from subtle is the irony in the fact that Empire!, that great British game, is being swallowed up by American capitalism. Less subtle still are the political points Alban drives home towards the end of the novel. &apos;The USA is a great country full of great people,&apos; he declares to an audience of family members. &apos;It&apos;s just their propensity as a whole for electing idiots and then conducting a foreign policy of the utmost depravity that I object to.&apos; The sentiment is hard to fault, but readers might hope for something a little more penetrating from a writer who sets himself up as a serious commentator on our times. This is emblematic of the problems that, with some exceptions, beset the novel on a broader scale. Banks is at his best in moments of high drama with extremes of human emotions. Jumbled memories of a drug-fuelled weekend in Singapore are reassembled in a series of long, virtuoso sentences from which all punctuation has drained in the sheer rush of events. Alban&apos;s heady summer tryst with his cousin is captured with an intensity that matches his desire and the drawn-out anguish when it abruptly ends. It&apos;s the slow drama of everyday life that seems to confound Banks here. Dialogue clunks along, jokes fall flat and, though he expends a good deal of ink on secondary characters, many fail to pop convincingly into three dimensions. The double act of batty great-aunts, one of whom mishears everything that&apos;s said, feels particularly cliched. This is frustrating with a writer in possession of a such fresh and fertile imagination. On this occasion, one can&apos;t help concluding that his heart wasn&apos;t completely in the job."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/26/guardianobituaries.obituaries", "sentences": ["Having attacked him for abandoning the expensive TSR2 aircraft project, he argued against quitting Singapore and Malaysia."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-26T08:48:34Z", "title": "Obituary: Earl Jellicoe", "tags": ["Politics"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday March 1 2007  In addition to the seven children mentioned in his obituary below, Earl Jellicoe had a son with Sara Harrity.    The death of the 2nd Earl Jellicoe, at the age of 88, evoked surprise that he was still in the House of Lords after the decanting of most hereditaries by Labour in 1999. In fact, Jellicoe was reincarnated as a life peer, and served with much distinction. The son of Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Jellicoe, who was elevated in honour of his 1916 victory over the Kaiser&apos;s navy at the battle of Jutland, he was a larger than life figure: second world war hero, Foreign Office high-flyer, Conservative politician and blue chip businessman. But though he was born into the high life - George V was his godfather - it was a brief entanglement with the low life that caused him to resign from government following a call-girl scandal in 1973. Curiously, that seemed all that remained in the public memory. But the fact was that Jellicoe&apos;s voluntary departure as leader of the Lords because he had, on occasion, used the same call girl as another government minister, Lord Lambton (obituary, January 2 2007), deprived the Conservative party of one of its most intelligent, hard-working and forward-looking leaders, at the peak of his powers. Though the end of his time in office coincided with Jellicoe&apos;s need for a larger income - he had two families to support - when his period of high earning tapered off in his 60s, he was quietly welcomed back into political life. In 1982, he was entrusted by home secretary William Whitelaw to review the Northern Ireland Prevention of Terrorism Act, and other establishment chores followed. Jellicoe earned this respect because, although born into the establishment, he did not allow it to corrupt his values, although he certainly had its goodies lavished on him. He was born two years after his father became a national hero, was initially made a viscount and had \u00a350,000 voted to him by a grateful parliament. Young George was also blessed in that his mother, Florence, was the daughter of the shipping magnate Sir Charles Cayzer. After prep school, he went to Winchester college. He was 17, and still a student there, when his father died, and he succeeded to the title. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner and got a first in history. &quot;The first major event which profoundly touched me,&quot; he later recalled, was the Munich agreement of 1939, which struck him with &quot;impotent pain and rage&quot;. When war came, rather than exploit his name in the Royal Navy, he opted for the Coldstream Guards, serving later with No 8 Commando and the 1st Special Air Services Regiment. He won the DSO for his part in a sabotage attack on a Nazi airfield at Heraklion, in Crete. He was parachuted on to the island, avoided capture by pretending to be a Cretan drunk, worked his way into the bomb-proof aircraft shelters and laid charges which destroyed 16 aircraft. He later commanded the Special Boat Regiment, which carried out increasingly successful operations in the central and eastern Mediterranean. He earned an MC - at 26 - in a parachute operation in Rhodes, when the Italians surrendered. He took part in the 1943 Dodecanese campaign, was taken prisoner but escaped and went on to command the forces that landed in the Peloponnesus in 1944, taking Patras and entering Athens on October 11. Ten days later, he was promoted to full colonel. On top of his British decorations, he won the Legion d&apos;Honneur, the Croix de Guerre and the Greek Military Cross. In 1944, he took off enough time to marry the Canadian-born Patricia O&apos;Kane. After the war, Jellicoe served with the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (Unrra) in Austria, in charge of several displaced persons&apos; camps. In 1947 he entered the Foreign Service, serving as first secretary in Washington, Brussels and Baghdad, where he was deputy secretary to the still-born Baghdad Pact Organisation. Baghdad, then a very dreary city, led him to experiment. &quot;I did once try my hand at hashish,&quot; he remembered. &quot;The experiment was a total failure, like my earlier experiment in cigar-smoking at Winchester. I derived no pleasure from it, only intense nausea.&quot; In 1958, he resigned from the Foreign Service and returned to London to become a director of two of his mother&apos;s family firms, British and Commonwealth Shipping and a subsidiary, and begin his political career in the Lords. Within months, prime minister Harold Macmillan, who had a weakness for aristocrats, made him parliamentary secretary for housing and local government; Macmillan&apos;s &quot;July massacre&quot; the following year projected Jellicoe to minister of state at the Home Office. Then, in 1963, Jellicoe&apos;s famously reasonable manner broke down: &quot;I have been shocked and annoyed by the niggling, sniggling, sneaking, sneering frame of mind which has resulted from the Profumo affair,&quot; he wrote. Friends felt that pressures in his personal life - his Catholic wife was refusing to divorce him, even though he was living with another woman, Philippa Bridge - made him hypersensitive. (It was not until 1966 that he got his divorce.) Jellicoe was happier when Sir Alec Douglas-Home replaced Macmillan, and promoted him to First Lord of the Admiralty in October 1963. He attracted attention only when he publically opined that it was possible at some time in the future for Britain to give up its independent nuclear deterrent. This was attacked as a &quot;gaffe&quot; by Labour&apos;s George Brown, fighting against Labour&apos;s own opponents of nuclear weapons. When Labour won the 1964 general election, Jellicoe did not immediately rush back to his City directorships because Harold Wilson&apos;s three-seat majority gave him hope he would soon be back in government. In the meantime, he established himself as an enlightened Tory. He backed Sydney Silverman&apos;s 1965 effort to ban capital punishment, showed his interest in retaining London as Europe&apos;s artistic capital and opposed Lord Salisbury&apos;s attempts to back the Ian Smith UDI regime in Rhodesia. Wilson&apos;s 100-seat majority in 1966 convinced Jellicoe he would have to earn his main living in the City. He became chairman of British Reserve Insurance, a director of SG Warburg (Finance and Development) Ltd and of the carpet manufacturers James Templeton. He kept his hand in in politics, insisting, in a 1967 debate, on the difference between the money motivation in business and the almost &quot;sensual pleasure&quot; of taking decisions in government. He joined the Home Office&apos;s advisory council on the penal system along with the Labour MP Leo Abse. This versatility was rewarded by promotion to deputy opposition leader in the Lords on the retirement of Lord Harlech, where again Jellicoe made Labour&apos;s defence secretary Denis Healey a target. Having attacked him for abandoning the expensive TSR2 aircraft project, he argued against quitting Singapore and Malaysia. He showed greater foresight in supporting a &quot;clear and coherent national airports policy&quot;. When Edward Heath became Tory leader, he made Jellicoe deputy chairman of the party&apos;s advisory committee on policy. In the 1968 debate on Lords reform, he reluctantly accepted the need for change. He was willing to say out loud what most Tories felt privately. In 1969, he said that, while Ted Heath &quot;was not the greatest opposition leader this country has ever known&quot;, he had &quot;the potential to be one of our greatest peacetime prime ministers&quot;. When Heath won the 1970 general election, he promoted Jellicoe to leader of the Lords and lord privy seal (in place of Lord Carrington, who became defence secretary). Jellicoe astonished the civil servants in the Printed Paper Office by the weight of the documents he took home every weekend. To such routine tasks, Heath added the responsibility for contingency planning to prevent Arthur Scargill again working the police as he had done in the blockade of the Saltley coke depot. But then, in 1973, the tensions of Jellicoe&apos;s heavy workload and the need to support two families took its toll. As he later disclosed, he relieved his &quot;personal tensions&quot; with call girls from Norma Levy&apos;s stable. It was the publicity surrounding the exposure of Lambton&apos;s three-in-a-bed frolic that precipitated matters. Jellicoe resigned, declaring, &quot;I behaved with incredulous stupidity.&quot; The fact that he immediately went on to join lucrative boards - Smith&apos;s Industries, Morgan Crucible, Tate and Lyle - confirmed the belief that he resisted appeals to stay in government in order to provide financially for his seven children and their mothers. His astute judgment, deployed in business, enabled him to become chairman of Tate and Lyle (1978-82) and of the engineering giant, the Davy Corporation (1985-90). Much later, as these commercial commitments tapered off, Jellicoe was quietly welcomed back into the Lords and the fringes of government. In 1982, when he did his thoughtful report on the Prevention of Terrorism Act, he also became chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board. As chairman of the Medical Research Council, in 1988, he supported embryo experimentation for up to 14 days, resisting the pressure of the Catholics&apos; spokesman, the Duke of Norfolk, in both 1989 and 1990. He showed his mastery of Lords&apos; procedure by his 1992 report on how to reform the committee work. It was probably that report, above all, that earned him one of the 10 life peerages awarded to hereditaries stripped of their rights to sit. He is survived by Philippa, their son and two daughters, and the two sons and two daughters of his first marriage. His eldest son, Patrick, succeeds to the title. \u00b7 George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe, politician and businessman, born April 4 1918; died February 22 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/26/business.citynews1", "sentences": ["It has a strong presence in China, and Latin America, while Spectrum, a purer consultancy business, advises clients in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and India."], "publicationDate": "2007-02-26T16:02:41Z", "title": "Spectrum to merge with Italian-based consultancy", "tags": ["Media", "Business", "Media business"], "article": "The influential media and communications experts Spectrum Strategy Consultants are to merge with Italian-based Value Partners.

He&apos;s gifted and he&apos;s podgy, which is sufficient excuse for the Fiver to refer to Ronaldinho as the Brazilian Lee Trundle. Alas, much as we would like to report that the Barcelona beefcake celebrated his team&apos;s 3-0 victory over La Liga bottom-feeders Bilbao last night by removing his jersey to reveal a &apos;**** off Espanyol&apos; T-shirt, that just didn&apos;t happen. Instead, he stripped off and cavorted in front of photographers like a gloating Chippendale, revealing nothing but a waistline that was nothing like a gloating Chippendale&apos;s. Samuel Eto&apos;o may have told L&apos;Equipe last week that he doesn&apos;t mind his team-mate attending &quot;only eight out of every 50 training sessions ... because he comes in for more rough treatment from defenders than anyone else,&quot; but that doesn&apos;t wash with the Spanish media, who last week linked Ronaldinho&apos;s increasingly shabby performances with his increasingly flabby physique - and published topless photos of him as he is now alongside similar ones of him taken a year ago, when the only extra weight he was carrying was less talented team-mates. &quot;Over the last week photos have come out insinuating I&apos;m fat,&quot; barked the Brazilian after his return to form last night. &quot;But I have always looked after myself and am in better shape now than ever,&quot; he continued, possibly while looking in one of those magic mirrors you see in circuses. &quot;With everything that has been said about me recently I was motivated to play even better against Bilbao,&quot; he concluded triumphantly, as the Fiver wondered if the real reason for his improved display is that Bilbao are lousy. But if he really has rediscovered his appetite for football and, like another famous Ronnie (ie Jeremy), manages to keep it up, then that&apos;s surely good news for everyone. Except Liverpool, of course.  ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal will swap one self-regarding striker for another by selling Thierry Henry to Inter and using the funds raised to buy Samuel Eto&apos;o from Barcelona.

The shipment of more than 6.5 tonnes of contraband tusks and ivory stamps was seized in Singapore after being packed into a 6m (20ft) container in Malawi and sent to the far east via South Africa. Using the map, researchers working with investigators from Interpol tracked the ivory to a narrow band of southern Africa, centring on Zambia. The investigation is the first time the map has been used to identify the source of an illegal haul of ivory and deals a significant blow to the trade, which has seen market prices soar from $100 (\u00a351) a kg in the late 1990s to $750 a kg last year. The dramatic rise has raised concerns that commodity speculators are now buying up ivory to cash in when prices peak. The map was constructed by scientists who extracted DNA from the tissues and dung of elephants in different regions, from the dense forests of western and central Africa to the vast savanna. The scientists identified genetic signatures belonging to each of the populations, which they later matched to the confiscated ivory products. The contraband, which was seized in June 2002, represents the largest haul to be intercepted since a broad trade ban was introduced in 1989. The container held 532 tusks, each weighing on average more than 11kg, suggesting they were cut from older elephants. A further 42,120 thick ivory cylinders called &quot;hankos&quot; were also recovered. In some Asian communities hankos are carved with personal seals and used as prestigious stamps. The value of the hankos alone has been estimated at $8.4m, amounting to around 20% of Japan&apos;s annual trade in the seals. Researchers estimate the entire haul resulted from the poaching of 3,000 to 6,500 elephants, according to the study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Investigators originally believed the ivory was smuggled into Malawi mainly from the forested regions of Africa. But researchers lead by Samuel Wasser at the University of Washington in Seattle conducted DNA tests on 67 of the tusks and found they matched elephants roaming a band of land across Zambia, and possibly regions of Mozambique and the Angolan savanna. The tests were possible only after painstakingly working out how to remove calcium from the tusks without harming the fragile genetic material. &quot;Until DNA came along you&apos;d always follow the paper trail, looking at shipping documents, who leased containers and so on, and you could almost always get back to the point of export. Now we can trace it back beyond export to the point of poaching, where the original crime is committed,&quot; said Bill Clark, a wildlife law enforcement expert and co-author of the paper. &quot;This gives enforcement officers information on which populations are being hit and so where they need to invest their resources. It&apos;s a very timely development, because poaching has intensified dramatically in recent years.&quot; The technique is now expected to be used to track more hauls back to their countries of origin. Researchers believe that around 20,000 elephants are killed by poachers each year, four times the number slaughtered three years ago. A poacher in Africa may earn $400 from ivory taken from one elephant, compared with a park ranger&apos;s monthly salary of less than $60. Last year nearly 24 tonnes of ivory were seized, but experts believe that represents only one tenth of all illegal ivory trade. &quot;We need tighter controls along the whole chain that leads from Africa to the markets, and that involves poaching, smuggling and usually corruption. But ultimately, terminating the fashion for ivory is the only thing likely to save the elephants,&quot; said Dr Clark."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/mar/01/drugsandalcohol.drugs", "sentences": ["The INCB report says the problem is most intense in Brazil, Argentina, Korea, the US, Singapore and Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-01T00:05:03Z", "title": "Prescription abuse outstrips illegal drug use, UN warns", "tags": ["Society", "UK news", "Drugs"], "article": "The abuse and trafficking of prescription drugs, including painkillers and stimulants, has overtaken the use of nearly all illegal drugs with the sole exception of cannabis, the United Nations drug control board warns today. The International Narcotics Control Board says the demand for painkillers, stimulants, sedatives and tranquillisers is so great that a global counterfeit market is rapidly developing. It also calls for a crackdown on the illicit availability of appetite suppressants, known as anorectics, which are fuelling a &quot;slimming obsession&quot; and led last year to the death of a Brazilian supermodel, Ana Carolina Reston. The drug control agency acknowledges that the drug situation in Afghanistan is swiftly deteriorating, with a record opium poppy harvest last year and the development of a colossal drug problem with more than a million opium users, according to the first countrywide survey. It reports that the 6,030-tonne 2006 crop was the highest ever. Afghan opium production provides 90% of the heroin sold on the streets of Britain. But while the INCB is critical of the international efforts, led by the UK, to eradicate poppy cultivation in Afghanistan it warns against legalising the crop. The UN-affiliated control board, which polices international drug treaties, says in its annual report published today that governments need to wake up to the extent of the prescription drug problem and take steps to end the illicit global trade. &quot;Medication containing narcotic drugs and/or psychotropic substances is even a drug of first choice in many cases. Such prescription drugs have effects similar to illicit drugs when taken in inappropriate quantities and without medical supervision. The &apos;high&apos; they provide is comparable to practically every illicitly manufactured drug,&quot; says the report. An INCB delegate, Hamid Ghodse of St George&apos;s hospital, London, said the unregulated market in prescription drugs was likely to double to $79bn (\u00a340bn) over the next four years, with 10% of those sold, mainly over the internet, already made up of counterfeit drugs. In developing countries the proportion of fake drugs rises to between 25% and 50%. The drugs cited in a US study include oxycodone which is traded as OxyContin and hyrdrocodone, also known as Viocodin. The INCB is particularly concerned about the trade in Fentanyl in North America and parts of Europe. The drug is said to be 80 times more potent than heroin. &quot;The danger is real and sizeable. The existence of unregulated markets means that sub-standard and sometimes even lethal medication is sold to the unsuspecting customer.&quot; Philip Emafo, INCB president, said most countries did not have any mechanism to systematically collect data on the problem and were not aware of the extent to which drugs were being abused. &quot;The very high potency of some of the synthetic narcotic drugs available as prescription drugs presents in fact a higher overdose risk than the abuse of illicit,&quot; he said. The INCB report says the problem is most intense in Brazil, Argentina, Korea, the US, Singapore and Hong Kong. Control measures have proved successful in France, Denmark and Chile."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/01/comment.india", "sentences": ["At this year&apos;s Vibrant Gujarat conclave, the showpiece of the BJP regime, the great names of Indian capitalism - Ambani, Birla, Tata - sang Modi&apos;s praises, echoed by delegations from Singapore, Europe and the US."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-01T00:11:52Z", "title": "Mike Marqusee: A blind eye to bigotry", "tags": ["India", "World news"], "article": "Five years ago this week, across the Indian state of Gujarat, the stormtroopers of the Hindu right, decked in saffron sashes and armed with swords, tridents, sledgehammers and liquid gas cylinders, launched a pogrom against the local Muslim population. They looted and torched Muslim-owned businesses, assaulted and murdered Muslims, and gang-raped and mutilated Muslim women. By the time the violence spluttered to a halt, about 2,500 Muslims had been killed and about 200,000 driven from their homes. The pogrom was distinguished not only by its ferocity and sadism (foetuses were ripped from the bellies of pregnant women, old men bludgeoned to death) but also by its meticulous advance planning. The leaders used mobile phones to coordinate the movement of an army of thousands through densely populated areas, targeting Muslim properties with the aid of computerised lists and electoral rolls provided by state agencies. Much of the violence unfolded with the full collaboration of the police. In some cases, police fired at Muslims seeking to flee the mobs. When asked to help a group of girls being raped on the roof of a building, police officers demurred, explaining: &quot;They have been given 24 hours to kill you.&quot; Subsequent investigations confirmed that police knew in advance of the pogrom and had been instructed not to interfere with it. Indian and global human rights organisations have singled out Gujarat&apos;s chief minister, Narendra Modi, of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), as the principal culprit. As a result of his alleged complicity in mass murder, he was denied a visa to the US and cannot visit Britain for fear of arrest. Yet Modi remains chief minister and has become not only the BJP&apos;s most popular figurehead, but also a poster boy for big business, foreign and domestic. Gujarat, which contains 5% of India&apos;s population, now boasts 18% of its investment and 21% of its exports. At this year&apos;s Vibrant Gujarat conclave, the showpiece of the BJP regime, the great names of Indian capitalism - Ambani, Birla, Tata - sang Modi&apos;s praises, echoed by delegations from Singapore, Europe and the US. Anxieties about dealing with a politician accused of genocide have been allayed by the appeal of Gujarat&apos;s corporation-friendly environment, not least its labour laws, which give employers hire-and-fire rights unique in India. Five years on, Muslims in Gujarat still live in fear. About 50,000 remain in refugee camps. Most of the cases filed by victims of the violence have never been investigated. Witnesses have been intimidated. No more than a dozen low-level culprits have been convicted. None of the major conspirators has been brought before the courts. The events of 2002 did not conform to the paradigm of the war on terror, in which India was a prize ally, so never achieved the infamy in the west they deserved. An array of interests - in New Delhi, London and Washington - is dedicated to ensuring the atrocity is consigned to oblivion. For them, the release of Parzania, a feature film centred on the violence, is an uncomfortable development. Despite dramatic flaws, it accurately depicts the savagery of the anti-Muslim violence, its planned, coordinated character, and the complicity of the police and the state government. Cinemas in Gujarat, under pressure from the Hindu right, are refusing to screen the film. If and when Parzania reaches audiences here and in the US, it will offer a necessary counter-tale to the fashionable fable of the Indian neoliberal miracle, exposing the brutality and bigotry that have gone hand in hand with zooming growth rates and hi-tech triumphalism. \u00b7 Mike Marqusee writes a column for the Hindu; his most recent book is Wicked Messenger: Bob Dylan and the 1960s.  www.mikemarqusee.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/02/mediadiary", "sentences": ["After seven years as panel producer on Question Time, Pank is going to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-02T10:15:00Z", "title": "February 26-March 2 2007", "tags": ["Media"], "article": "The currant bumPing! An email arrives from Sun deputy editor Fergus Shanahan, pointing out that he identified Michael Knott as the botty double in ITV1&apos;s John Prescott romp, Confessions of a Diary Secretary, weeks before the Mirror (see Monkey below). Shanahan says he mentioned Knott in his column on February 9, but has the good grace to admit that he got the story from the Independent diary. Credit where credit is due. Dining outNewsnight&apos;s Michael Crick has been delving into a fascinating little curiosity - the fact that the media is no longer able to reproduce the photo of David Cameron and Boris Johnson when they were part of Oxford University&apos;s elite dining society, the Bullingdon Club - a story the Times&apos;s Martin Waller was on to a fortnight ago. The 1986 photo was unearthed by the Mail on Sunday last month - but the copyright owners, Oxford photographers Gillman &amp; Soame, have withdrawn it from further use. They say they&apos;ve not been under any pressure to do so and made the decision for commercial reasons (a line of reasoning that somehow ignores the opportunity for future royalties). However, it&apos;s fair to say that the reproduction of a flagrantly elitist image, not least in enemy propaganda, would hardly have done Cameron&apos;s man of the people image much good. Crick - who knows his Oxford lore as a former Oxford Union president and one-time editor of Oxford student paper Cherwell - explains the story on his blog. A trifling mistakeThe Daily Mirror engaged in a bit of good, old-fashioned class war today, lampooning David Cameron&apos;s &quot;Eton trifles&quot; - the 15 Old Etonians he has picked as shadow ministers. There is one unlikely face in the line-up, however, that of the former Tory leader Michael Howard, who is billed incorrectly as &quot;Lord Howard&quot; (he isn&apos;t even a knight yet) and famously went to a grammar school in south Wales - he once relished the fact in the Commons when lectured about state education by Fettes alumnus Tony Blair. The Mirror has got Howard confused with genuine OE Greville Howard, Lord Howard of Rising, now a shadow minister but never party leader. Its potted biography, beneath a picture of Michael, completely confuses the two. &quot;Ex-Tory leader and former adviser to racist Enoch Powell, 65-year-old Greville Patrick Charles Howard was made life peer in 2004 by Iain Duncan Smith. Ex-Etonian businessman is married to 1960s model Sandra. Has three kids.&quot; Anyway, who cares if you muddle them up to potentially libellous effect, these bloody Tory toffs are all the same, aren&apos;t they?

That unsung bum ought to be credited and, if it comes forward or, of course, backwards, I will be happy to do so.&quot; Well, she should thank the Mirror today for identifying said arse.

Well, today anyway. Self-leaking may be the only answerAs Oscar Wilde once said: &quot;There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.&quot; But try telling that to Daily Telegraph web news editor, Shane Richmond. He has blogged on the Telegraph site complaining about how his email instructions to bloggers &quot;have a habit&quot; of getting leaked to MediaGuardian. Shane is clearly miffed by this turn of events because &quot;After all, MediaGuardian&apos;s speciality is to use the cover of &apos;objective analysis&apos; to put the boot into rivals&quot;. Ouch! Shane, we feel your pain. The web news editor then decides that one solution to the leaking problem could be to send subtly different versions of his emails to everyone and see which version shows up at the Guardian. &quot;On the other hand, perhaps I could just copy in the Guardian on future emails. It would save a lot of hassle.&quot; Monkey entirely agrees. But sadly he is yet to put his plan into action. What a shame, Shane. Whose do?There are two big medialand leaving dos in central London tonight. Monkey suspects Freud&apos;s vice-chairman Kris Thykier&apos;s bash at Soho House may be the more glitzy. But across town at the Reform Club another significant departure is being marked, with colleagues and friends bidding farewell to long-serving ITV exec Clive Jones.

Look, I can spin really fastFresh from the political row over his duping of Margaret Beckett, impressionist Rory Bremner has come up with some fascinating insights into Alastair Campbell and his own tactics with the fourth estate. &quot;Alastair Campbell once objected to the way he was shown in my series and actually said to me: &apos;who&apos;s that fat bastard playing me?&apos;. [It was actor Andrew Dunn]. He then showed me his exercise routine, bench presses and running and so on to prove how fit he was. But soon after that there was a story in the Express saying that we were thinking of getting rid of Andrew Dunn because he was too fat. There were only two people having that conversation and I certainly didn&apos;t tell the Express that. It showed how he works.&quot; Still, Bremner is not annoyed any more and is even happy to offer Ally some advice. &quot;Maybe he should help out Britney Spears. He has a crush on her and she could do with him right now.&quot; All-star lineupMorrissey may no longer be involved in this year&apos;s Eurovision song contest but there&apos;s still a modicum of star quality in the shortlist of contenders for the British nomination unveiled by the BBC today. So who have we got on the list? R&amp;B hip-hop group Big Brovaz will be singing Big Bro Thang, East 17 and I&apos;m A Celebrity... veteran Brian Harvey will be contributing I Can (though it doesn&apos;t say here what exactly it is he&apos;s capable of). Atomic Kitten Liz McClarnon will treat us to (Don&apos;t It Make You) Happy, and former Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins will duet with someone called Beverlei Brown to perform They Don&apos;t Make &apos;Em Like They Used To. The list is completed by newcomer Cyndi and reformed quartet (it says here) Scooch. Next month&apos;s Making Your Mind Up show (that&apos;s A Song For Europe to older viewers) will feature a performance from last year&apos;s surprise winners, Finnish rockers Lordi. And in more good news, the delightful Fearne Cotton, fresh from her triumphant behind-the-scenes reporting stints at the Brits and the Oscars, will be helping Terry Wogan with presenting duties. Sadly no Jordan this year though. Time to move onOhmigod! For the first time since Celebrity Big Brother, the main picture on the front page of Heat magazine this week is not one of the unholy trinity of Jade Goody, Jo O&apos;Meara and Danielle Lloyd. The acres of sympathetic coverage of the &quot;Bitches of Eastwick&quot; has truly warmed the heart. Strangely, the victim, Shilpa Shetty, has barely got a look in. What&apos;s that you say? CBB presenters Davina McCall and Dermot O&apos;Leary are both columnists in Heat. Coincidence surely. Obviously the latest Heat still features one of the trio on the cover: this week it&apos;s Jo. And still not an apology in sight. For this week&apos;s main cover photo, however, Heat is promoting a harrowing investigation of the Darfur crisis. Not really. It&apos;s a picture of Lindsay Lohan with no knickers. Classy. Trotters finally make a mintHow much would you pay for an old Robin Reliant? Surely not 40,000 pounds? Today&apos;s Times and Telegraph report that this was the princely sum that was forked out last night for a three-wheeled van that appeared in TV classic Only Fools and Horses. It even had a logo for Trotters Independent Trading Co, New York, Paris, Peckham on the side. Del Boy would have been thrilled. Tuesday February 27 Has sun set on Frost?Have we seen the last of mardy detective inspector Jack Frost? Actor David Jason hinted today that he may have made his last A Touch of Frost for ITV1, but then seemed to backtrack. Jason told hacks at the press launch for his new ITV1 drama Diamond Geezer, in which he plays a criminal, that he was looking at &quot;saying goodbye to Frost, just as I&apos;ve said goodbye to Pop Larkin, and goodbye to Del Trotter&quot;. He added it was &quot;hard to play a criminal one moment, and a detective the next&quot; and that filming Frost in Yorkshire meant &quot;being away from my family for so long&quot;. However, he left the door open when he laughed: &quot;I don&apos;t know ... whether I can be persuaded ... helicopters are all part of the deal.&quot; Monkey senses a big pot of money might also convince him... Burley&apos;s bosom gets an airingSky News host Kay Burley a stripper? Not quite, but she was once recorded in a TV studio talking about taking off her bra. An old TV-am Christmas party tape that has surfaced following criticism from various Dancing on Ice judges about the skating performance of La Burley, particularly that she fails to &quot;exude warmth&quot;. Never meant to see the light of day, this gem has nevertheless ended up on t&apos;internet. Kay makes her first appearance about two minutes in, with a tete-a-tete with TV-am news presenter Gordon Honeycombe (remember him?!). The two news presenters engage in some mindless banter before Gordon asks Kay what she has done with her bra. &quot;I took it off when I was talking to you,&quot; coquettish Kay purrs about events that occurred off camera. Why? &quot;To reveal more of my heaving bosom,&quot; says Kay with a grin, &quot;That&apos;s a bit mucky for a Sunday morning, isn&apos;t it?&quot; The smell of nostalgia in the morningAre you, like Monkey, keen for a bit of TV-am nostalgia? Then click here to be instantly transported back to breakfast television of the 1980s, a time when Pamela Stephenson pulled down Nick Owen&apos;s trousers live on air, and Anne Diamond scrambled to deploy a sofa cushion to preserve his modesty. All the stars are there - Anneka Rice, Wincy Willis, Giles Brandreth, Lisa Aziz and even cooking expert Rustie Lee, whose Caribbean Christmas cake recipe proved very popular with viewers. And did you know that Lee joined UKIP and stood as a candidate for them at the last general election? Monkey certainly didn&apos;t. ITV primed for success?Charlie Brooker gave Primeval the thumbs up on his BBC4 show Screen Wipe last night. He also thinks it&apos;s better than Torchwood - granted, that&apos;s not saying much in some people&apos;s eyes. But its worth repeating: Charlie Brooker likes Primeval. Does ITV&apos;s critical revival start here? Channel 4 to show a lot more of Jon SnowJon Snow is not known for being backwards in coming forwards when it comes to sartorial eccentricity but viewers will soon get to see a whole new side of the Channel 4 News presenter when he appears in a new promo - wearing just a loin cloth. As part of Channel 4&apos;s new series of promos where their big name talent answer random questions (the next ones will be &quot;what is your slogan?&quot; and &quot;how do you want to be remembered?&quot;), the broadcaster has commissioned a very expensive oil painting of Snow wearing nothing but said skimpy item and surrounded by three adoring &quot;maidens&quot;. Monkey isn&apos;t exactly sure why but guesses Snow didn&apos;t complain too much. Plus he got to keep the painting. Whether he is still wearing his trademark red socks is another question entirely. Catty remarksComic Relief Fame Academy host Patrick Kielty has lashed out at his former co-host Cat Deeley for upping sticks and deserting Britain, according to the Sun. Kielty attacks the star for heading to the US to make money. &quot;Cat&apos;s turned her back on us. Good luck to her and her capitalism.&quot; Tells us what you really think, Patrick. Monday February 26 Burleyesque performancePop quiz, hot shot: you are plucky Sky News presenter Kay Burley, being interviewed by the Sunday Express about the critical drubbing you received for your allegedly corpse-like performances in Dancing on Ice. Do you: a) rise above the small-minded abuse, saying &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones . . . &quot; etc, thus emerging the bigger person, or b) declare: &quot;I felt like the Shilpa Shetty of Dancing on Ice.&quot; If you answered b), Sunday Express readers may feel inclined to agree with Jason Gardiner&apos;s claim that you &quot;wouldn&apos;t even exude warmth if you were on fire&quot;. That said, Burley certainly put her body on the line during Dancing on Ice, collecting an injury list of which even accident-prone England footy captain John Terry would be proud. To recap: two fractured ribs, another damaged, twisted knee, knocked unconscious, black eye, dislocated thumb and strained back. By &apos;eck, they rear &apos;em tough in Wigan. The Seagal has landedStep aside J-Lo, there&apos;s a new prima donna in town, in the unlikely shape of . . . Steven Seagal. The tough guy Hollywood action hero is touring the UK with his blues band Thunderbox. (March 3 at Blackburn King George&apos;s Hall and other venues, for those interested). Freelance photographers have been shocked by the release agreement Seagal&apos;s people are asking them to sign. In return for $1, photographers must not only assign copyright, but also hand over all negatives, slide negatives and digital equivalent within five days, waive all moral rights and indemnify the company and the artist against all claims. Oh, and if photographers breach the agreement, they are liable for a cool $1m. National Union of Journalists freelance organiser John Toner said: &quot;This contract was written by someone who has not grasped the concept &apos;professional photographer&apos;. Why on earth would any professional wish to take pictures of Mr Seagal unless there is potential income? Steven Seagal might be &apos;Out For A Kill&apos;, but photographers are &apos;Out for Justice&apos;.&quot; Monkey couldn&apos;t have put it better. Cotton on and on againOscars watch: Sky One boss Richard Woolfe might want to rethink his channel&apos;s &quot;live&quot; red carpet coverage of the Hollywood awards do. By unfortunate coincidence last night Sky One&apos;s red carpet correspondent, Fearne Cotton, was stationed in close proximity to US entertainment news channel E!&apos;s camera position. As a result, Cotton&apos;s mantra that she was covering the event &quot;live&quot; was somewhat undermined by the fact that her interviews could be seen in the background of E!&apos;s coverage several minutes before they appeared on Sky. But it&apos;s all good - viewers got two chances to see her calling Brit actor Michael Sheen &quot;Martin&quot;, and having an embarrassing exchange with Jennifer Lopez, who had to keep telling Cotton the man she was referring to as Marc Anthony was actually, er . . . someone else. And the Natasha Kaplinsky award for most embarrassing red carpet interviewer goes to . . . Headless trainingFollowing what Monkey might politely refer to as all the &quot;interesting&quot; decisions by executives at the Daily Telegraph over the past few months, the human resources department was asked to run &quot;leadership training&quot; for department heads and senior editorial people. Just when Monkey expected an outbreak of niceness from among the senior Telegraph ranks, the human resources department issued the following email on Thursday to senior execs. &quot;Dear All, Please be aware that due to a high volume of non-attendance for today&apos;s Editorial Leadership Programme, this afternoon&apos;s session has been cancelled.&quot; Still, a caring and sharing Telegraph was a nice, if fleeting, thought. Back room BryantWhat are you doing tonight? If you are John Bryant, the late &quot;editor-in-chief&quot; of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, you&apos;ll be having your belated leaving party. (Bryant slipped out the back door of Telegraph HQ on New Year&apos;s Eve.) The venue will be a small back room at the Garrick Club. Let&apos;s hope, for the sake of peace and goodwill at Telegraph Towers, there is a no-black-balling policy. Skate thatThank you, ITV. Saturday night&apos;s Dancing on Ice provided us with quite possibly the campest and cheesiest TV event in history - the previously undreamt-of collaboration of Take That and Torvill and Dean. The loveable thirtysomething crooners bashed out their stomping new single while the veteran skatemeisters whizzed around in front of them. Both British national treasures, both making comebacks after 10 years away from the big time, and hell they&apos;ve both still got it - in spades. It wasn&apos;t just Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby who had their breath taken away. This was awesome telly - all the way to Jayne Torvill mounting the piano and Christopher Dean buddy-clasping Jason Orange - and happily you can watch it here. Boris monsters the BeastEarlier this year Boris Johnson was seen furtively swapping numbers with the Daily Mail&apos;s consultant editor Sarah Sands, and heard wryly asking her if she was the &quot;Oskar Schindler&quot; offering Telegraph hacks a chance of freedom - prompting speculation that he was being encouraged to defect. Not any more, judging by his column on Thursday. Entirely devoted to the Mail, lightly veiled as &quot;the Beast&quot;, it lambasted the paper for the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of combining &quot;porn&quot; - raunchy DVDs, steamy kiss-and-tells - with &quot;hellfire sermons&quot;. The Beast, wrote Boris, is &quot;just about the most savage and hysterical and reactionary newspaper in Britain&quot;. Prince BarberAmid all the acclaim for Helen Mirren in The Queen, one actor&apos;s efforts got lost in the mix. The chap playing Prince Harry in Stephen Frears&apos;s film is none other than Financial Times editor Lionel Barber&apos;s son, Dash, who is named after the crime writer Dashiell Hammett. Another of its largely unsung stars is the Power of Nightmares producer and director Adam Curtis, who wove the archive footage into the film. &quot;Stephen threw out all my best jokes, the bastard,&quot; jokes Curtis, who will be doing the same job for Frears on his next project, an adaptation of David Peace&apos;s The Damned Utd, starring Michael Sheen as Brian Clough. Father Ted failureBBC1 controller Peter Fincham may not be the talent spotter Monkey thought he was. We only mention this after seeing this Friday&apos;s edition of BBC1&apos;s Comedy Connections about Alas Smith and Jones, made by Fincham&apos;s old production company, Talkback. Mel Smith recalls that the show&apos;s writing team included Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, and that Fincham once reported back from a meeting with the Irish duo thus: &quot;I&apos;ve had a couple of ideas from them. I passed on one, I think the best one is the one we&apos;ve got.&quot; And the one he let go? Father Ted. Snapper slipThe &quot;royals&apos; favourite photographer&quot; (copyright the Sun) Arthur Edwards went on Radio 5 Live to big up Prince Harry and his credentials for going on a tour of duty in Iraq. What a shame, then, that Edwards appeared to forget the script halfway through his conversation with Stephen Nolan. &quot;He is a real powerhouse. He is desperate to do it . . . I don&apos;t think Harry&apos;s the sharpest tool in the shed, no . . .&quot; Better make that &quot;14th favourite photographer&quot;. Richard and Judy offer&quot;Three for two on all Richard and Judy book club titles,&quot; says an email from Monkey&apos;s second favourite high street book store, Borders. No reflection on Borders, of course, but given the publicity generated by Richard and Judy&apos;s unfortunate phone-in competition balls-up, perhaps we should be grateful they didn&apos;t come up with a &quot;two for the price of three&quot; offer. Flushed with successITV News staff were all given a bottle of champagne or a box of chocolates after the news provider&apos;s success at the Royal Television Society awards last week, with most opting for the former. But young journalist of the year Matt Williams could have done with a new phone after he dropped his down a toilet at the Met Bar at the post-awards bash. &quot;It was still clear, let&apos;s put it at that,&quot; explained Williams. That&apos;s the toilet, not his phone. Five News reporter Jason Farrell, meanwhile, lost touch with his dinner jacket - with his house keys still in the pocket. Let&apos;s hope no one was trying to contact them at the time with next year&apos;s scoop of the year. Health RecordLast Friday&apos;s Daily Record devoted its splash and pages eight and nine to a report revealing that twice as many Scots die of alcohol-related illnesses as citizens from the rest of the UK. And the sensitively placed advertisement on page 10? &quot;Twenty per cent off all our wines, beers and spirits - at M&amp;S. ITV&apos;s got your number&quot;The Daily Star spares a thought for seven-year-old Ellie Griffiths, of Hadleigh, Essex, who suddenly found that her mobile phone (why does a seven-year-old have a mobile?) was flooded with calls for requests for drugs.

Instead, having failed to choose between Morgan and his Indian opposite number, Sharad Pawar, the ICC board invited South Africa&apos;s Percy Sonn to extend his term to a third year, taking him through to June 2009. The ICC&apos;s governance review committee will re-examine the process for identifying his successor. Two days of lobbying left the board split. The ECB chairman is understood to have the support of five full-member nations - England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and West Indies - while Pawar won support from the Asian block of India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh and, crucially, Zimbabwe. The troubled African nation supported Morgan in a vote taken by a nominations committee set up to recommend a preferred candidate but has now fallen in behind Pawar, apparently on the promise of a swift return to full Test status. Few believe Zimbabwe are ready to compete again at that level and Morgan would be justified in feeling aggrieved, given the calculated risk he took in insisting that England fulfil a one-day series in the country in 2004. With the five-five split producing the prospect of the associate members, Kenya, Singapore and Israel, selecting the new chairman, the board decided to look again at the process. Morgan&apos;s best chance of being elected seems to rest on the board returning to the rotation system that has previously been in operation. England have never provided a president of the ICC, though the game was run for many decades from the MCC in London. Pawar, the Indian agriculture minister, has been a member of the ICC board for 15 months and, despite his eagerness to secure the presidency, is understood to have spent only an hour in the board meeting on the first day in Cape Town. India&apos;s status as the primary revenue generator affords great influence and the prospect of a split between Asia and the rest of the world looms.

The organisers of the Games take people up here to enthuse them - the Queen, Gordon Brown and of course the International Olympic Committee - and the exercise works; to see derelict land being tilled for reclamation is emotionally quite stirring. But then you come back to earth and you wonder. &quot;Don&apos;t be down on the Olympics.&quot; A friend said this to me as I left to meet Sebastian Coe, and her tone was plaintive. Arguments about cost, transport and regenerative value conceal what I suspect is an impulsive reaction based on less rational criteria: where you stand on the Olympics will probably have some deep-seated connection to where you stood on PE at school. Most Games enthusiasts I know are hockey and netball squad alumni who believe in the unifying power of team sports and the value of tabulated ranking systems. Most Games sceptics I know hated sports at school, were never picked first and will howl when they read this and say it traduces the complexity of their argument. Nevertheless, throw an Olympics sceptic a ball and I guarantee he won&apos;t catch it. In this scenario Sebastian Coe is like the nightmare PE teacher who, through some fit of collective madness, has been given a \u00a32bn budget and government-backed power to make us all, five years hence, stay in on Saturday afternoons and watch athletics. We are in his office high up in Canary Wharf and he is talking about the problem of enthusing truculent Brits. &quot;Some days you think it&apos;s endearing, other days you think it&apos;s irritating,&quot; says Coe. &quot;We do have a wonderful propensity in this country to doubt our ability. We have fantastic examples of excellence at every level, whether it&apos;s in the arts, sciences, in the quality of our policing or armed services. And yet we sometimes enter a tunnel of despair about it, which few other countries actually do.&quot; Coe has a head boy gleam about him that makes lots of people instinctively want to push him in the mud. But his combination of world record-holding pedigree (he held the 800m record for 16 years), political experience (five years as Tory MP for Falmouth and Camborne and William Hague&apos;s chief of staff) and his general snap and affability played an undeniable part in the bid&apos;s success. Now he heads up the organising committee responsible for stage managing the games. This is distinct from the planning and construction body, the Olympic Delivery Authority, members of which Coe refers to as the &quot;heavy lifters&quot; and to whom he passes on funding inquiries with a not-in-my-remit-mate shrug. His main job at the moment is to get out into the country and drum up some excitement. As with all enormous enterprises, you get a blood rush just by listing the statistics. Nine-and-a-half million tickets will go on sale in 2011 at a yet-to-be-determined price and the venues will be scattered across London: gymnastics and the basketball final in the Dome, beach volleyball in Horse Guards Parade, six different combat sports in the Excel centre, an aquatic centre designed by Zaha Hadid and a massive new tennis complex. The Olympic site itself will be the largest new park built in Europe for 150 years - the size of Hyde Park, with 8km of waterways and trains bringing 240,000 people in an hour. There will be accommodation for 4,500 Paralympians, increasing housing stock for disabled people wanting to live in the Waltham Forest area; a press centre for 20,000 hacks; 70,000 volunteers. Etc etc. Coe&apos;s enthusiasm is appealing and survives even the fire blanket of jargon he throws over it. There are lots of &quot;faith-based engagement programmes&quot; going on, lots of &quot;scoping out of opportunity&quot; and &quot;natural buy-ins&quot; and &quot;bridgeheads&quot; and &quot;potential vehicles&quot; and &quot;frameworks of delivery&quot;. There is also, of course, much &quot;communicating with young people&quot;, particularly via the &quot;internet&quot;. It&apos;s for the kids, primarily, and here we come to the PE problem - there&apos;s a risk that the Olympics will appeal to children who already have healthy sports lives and bypass those who don&apos;t. If I was a disaffected kid and someone told me to cheer up and handed me a javelin, I think I&apos;d know what to do with it without too much instruction. &quot;The toughest quest in a school is to get kids excited by sport but recognise that you can get that by being in the C or D teams or actually&quot; - Coe looks a bit shocked by this idea - &quot;not even being in a team at all, but just enjoying it.&quot; He has broad social ideals for the games that stretch a little thinly at the edges - for example, he would like them to knock the nail in the coffin of &quot;unedifying&quot; reality television. &quot;If we get this right in 2012 we can pull some of that territory back and I think that we do have an opportunity to create some pretty serious reality television.&quot; By &quot;faith-based engagement programmes&quot; Coe means getting out and finding volunteers from all communities. &quot;I suppose that&apos;s what makes me politically tick - I don&apos;t think you run things from headquarters. We&apos;re not skilled or resourced to sit here and tell people in Blackburn how they&apos;re going to get the most out of the games.&quot; The first showcase for Coe and his team will be an eight-minute slot in the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games. They haven&apos;t planned it yet, he says, but are working with Bill Morris, former director of live events at the BBC. &quot;It&apos;s a huge moment, probably the biggest since Singapore. It lays out the narrative, sets the scene for London. There will be a huge collective intake of, oh my god it&apos;s our turn next.&quot; The reason the Australian opening ceremony worked, thinks Coe, is that it was humorous - &quot;piss-taking enough of themselves&quot; to appeal to a global audience. He gets more letters about the opening ceremony than any other issue. &quot;Bring back Concorde, lets have tiddlywinks, Morris dancers etc.&quot; Athens opened with a spotlight on two guys hammering the finishing touches to the stadium, as if to say &quot;we&apos;ve had a gutful&quot; of people alleging it won&apos;t be ready on time. Coe sympathises with this. His organisation doubles its staff every year. Ultimately, it will employ 3,000 people. In terms of British medal hopes, he thinks that athletes need to factor in the pressure of performing in front of a home crowd. He occasionally wonders whether, if the 1980 Olympics had been staged in Britain rather than Russia, he could have knocked a few seconds off his own world title. &quot;I actually sit and think about that.&quot; On balance, he thinks he was lucky to have performed in Moscow under less pressure. &quot;On the other hand, the home crowd will make the difference between somebody making fourth or fifth place and getting a bronze. There&apos;s no doubt about that.&quot; Nothing in Coe&apos;s private conversations with Gordon Brown has led him to believe that the Chancellor is, as rumour has it, unenthusiastic about the games. His response to panic about spiralling costs is that every host nation went through jitters like this - &quot;how a nation deals with excellence and achievement is one of the fundamental litmus tests&quot; - and he points out the contradiction of people who complain about the games also complaining about how useless this nation is at producing gold medals. One believes Coe when he says that he has no plans post-Olympics. &quot;I will be in my mid-50s. I have an ambition to settle in Australia at some stage.&quot; After he lost his seat in the Commons, he says, &quot;I decided that was it. I wasn&apos;t going to go back. Move on.&quot; But he did stay on, to work with Hague. &quot;That was William saying can you help out and I said I&apos;ll do two days a week, he said four, I compromised and did seven. That was four years. He&apos;s very persuasive - that was a south Yorkshire deal, really.&quot; Anyway at the moment he is in very good spirits and that is, of course, because despite the beginnings of the backlash, he - we - still won. &quot;If you go to Paris or Madrid or Moscow or New York, they know what they missed out on. And sometimes I think it&apos;s slightly overlooked that this is a huge prize. It is not an albatross. It&apos;s the only job that my kids understand that I&apos;ve ever done. &quot;They used to say, what do you do? Well I go to Central Office. We know, but what do you do? What on earth is a whip? This time it&apos;s very simple: I go to the office each day to work with a team that will deliver the Olympic Games.&quot; This sporting life Born: 1956 Sebastian Coe joined his local athletics club, Hallamshire Harriers in Sheffield, at the age of 12. Coached by his father, Peter, he became English Schools Champion in 1972 and in the same year ran his first race against Steve Ovett, a schools cross country. Neither boy won. 1979 Coe broke three world records in 41 days, in 800 metre, mile and 1500 metre races, and was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year. 1980 Moscow Olympic Games Coe won gold in the 1500 metres and came second in the 800 metres, behind Steve Ovett. 1982 Coe - along with Peter Elliott, Garry Cook and Steve Cram - set a world record in the 4 x 400 metre relay (7:03.89) that would stand for 24 years until it was bettered by both the Kenyans and Americans in the summer of 2006. 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games Coe again took silver in the 800 metres and gold in the 1500 metres. Controversially, he was left out of the British team for the 1988 Seoul games and retired from sport in 1990. 1992 Elected a Conservative MP, Coe later worked as William Hague&apos;s chief of staff, and went running and practised judo with the Tory leader. A life peer since 2000, he took over as the chairman of the London Olympic bid after the resignation of Barbara Cassani in 2004."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/04/motorracing.motorsports", "sentences": ["Each team represents a different country, 22 in all, ranging from Great Britain and Ireland to the USA, Pakistan and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-04T18:10:57Z", "title": "Motor racing: Hulkenberg on road to glory", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "A1GP"], "article": "The A1GP series, launched by Sheikh Maktoum in 2004, regards itself as second only to Formula One in terms of global identity. It is a valid claim when the logistics are examined. A1GP&apos;s World Cup of Motor Sport raced in South Africa last weekend as it continued to demonstrate a wider reach than F1 while heading towards the conclusion of a championship that will have visited the Far East, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and the Czech Republic before the final round at Brands Hatch on 29 April. The only problem is that this well organised and entertaining international contest remains one of motor sport&apos;s best-kept secrets, not that you would have guessed as Durban claimed 114,000 spectators over the three days. Motor sport has always been popular in South Africa thanks to F1 world championship races being staged, on and off, between 1962 and 1993. Yet none of the F1 venues in that country could match the streets of Durban and a fast but tricky track that is more difficult than Bahrain and Shanghai, F1&apos;s charmless but highly touted models of efficiency. The A1GP concept is similarly unique. Each team represents a different country, 22 in all, ranging from Great Britain and Ireland to the USA, Pakistan and Singapore. Drivers must hail from the nation in question, Britain being adequately represented last weekend by Robbie Kerr as the Englishman finished second in the main race, a tense 70-minute battle that included a mandatory pit stop to change tyres. While Britain, New Zealand, Switzerland and Portugal fought relentlessly for second place, Germany&apos;s representative, Nico Hulkenberg, dominated the race. One of the purposes of A1GP is to highlight young talent and it is succeeding because, on the basis of his speed and extraordinary maturity, 19-year-old Hulkenberg will be in F1 sooner rather than later. It was no coincidence that Willi Weber backs the German team, Michael Schumacher&apos;s manager travelling to Durban to oversee the moulding of his next world champion. Paradoxically, Weber&apos;s support for A1GP highlighted its greatest weakness, the immaculately coiffured impresario signing autographs and proving to be more famous than the young drivers he might wish to represent in the future. Perhaps the best thing Weber could do for the series would be to persuade Schumacher - when the inevitable boredom sets in during retirement - to take part in just one race. A well known name would trigger the media attention the series needs and provide the young stars with the best yardstick imaginable. Schumacher, in the unlikely event of him taking up the challenge, ought to win thanks to the emphasis being on the contribution of drivers in cars that are identical. But it would not be as straightforward as he might think. The Lola cars are not sophisticated and the number of technical staff per team is limited to 10, all of which helps keep costs at a manageable level. A one-car outfit competing at the 12 meetings comes at the exceptionally reasonable sum of $5m, a tenth of the figure demanded by any self-respecting F1 team. A lack of the excessive aerodynamic downforce, which dumbs down the raw excitement of F1, means A1GP cars are tricky to drive. The power from the 500bhp V8 engine exceeds the capacity of the chassis to handle it; a combination that has always provided the best examination of a driver&apos;s talent. Throw in the uneven surface of a street circuit and concrete walls lining its edges and you have the ingredients for as tough a challenge that any driver could wish for. Not that F1 cares particularly about the needs of spectators - mere second-class citizens when placed alongside the financial potential created by F1&apos;s world-wide television audience - but A1GP provides valuable lessons in respect for the paying punter. Each car is painted in national colours, thereby making it instantly recognisable, unlike an F1 car that carries a single number so insultingly small that the driver may as well give the crowd the finger as he speeds past. The A1GP website not only provides driver blogs but also invites participation by the fans. Sponsors&apos; guests are invited to mingle on the grid 20 minutes before the start of the race, a novel idea that would cause Bernie Ecclestone to have a fit. When A1GP made its debut at Brands Hatch at September 2005, some observers wrongly assumed the series was attempting to oust F1. Nothing could be further from the truth since A1GP consists of many ex-F1 people who know the world championship is unlikely to be matched, never mind toppled from its position of authority. None the less, the return to Brands Hatch next month will demonstrate just how much A1GP has grown and deserves a place at the important end of the sport&apos;s hierarchy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/05/mondaymediasection.financialtimes", "sentences": ["This was in many ways a return to his roots; when he was seven his father&apos;s business relocated to Malaysia and the family lived in Kuala Lumpur, later moving on to Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T07:27:20Z", "title": "Interview: John Ridding", "tags": ["National newspapers", "Media", "Financial Times", "Newspapers"], "article": "John Ridding looks remarkably refreshed for a man who has just stepped off a transatlantic flight, and who spent the previous night at a party. As chief executive of the Financial Times, he had been hosting a celebration in New York to mark the 10th anniversary of his newspaper&apos;s US launch. &quot;It was fantastic,&quot; he says, talking excitedly of &quot;the fulsome tribute to the FT brand from Mayor Bloomberg&quot; and &quot;the wonderful guest list&quot;, before pointing to &quot;the happy coincidence&quot; of the American edition achieving a new circulation record of 157,000 copies a day. Ridding was also smiling for a slightly more personal reason. After spending seven hours on the plane at his computer he experienced one of those digital nightmares in which all his work vanished. Then, just before his plane landed, he found it all again. That incident could be a metaphor for Ridding&apos;s own career at the FT: he spent nearly 20 years as a journalist before becoming chief executive last May, rode out a difficult period in his early days as CEO when painful staff cuts were made, then had the intense pleasure of seeing a risky strategy succeed. Success indeed. Last week the FT reported a leap in profits for 2006 from \u00a32m to \u00a311m, with sales up 8% to \u00a3238m and advertising revenues rising 9%. So Ridding has a good story to tell, and he tells it with enthusiasm. In his sixth-floor office overlooking the Thames at Southwark Bridge, he talks animatedly about the paper&apos;s new-found sense of purpose under his leadership and the editorship of Lionel Barber, who was appointed in November 2005. He argues that the FT&apos;s strength is its ability to be both global and niche. In other words, it has a global presence and reports on global events, but it does so from the perspective of a niche audience - decision-makers in business and government. &quot;We are very targeted in terms of our audience to ensure that we can offer a very effective sale for advertisers&quot;, he says. &quot;We aim for a C-suite readership.&quot; For those, like me, who have yet to catch up on this piece of American jargon, &quot;C-suite&quot; refers to the high end of business chiefs: chief executives, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, chief technical officers, and so on. Ridding is, of course, a C-suite chap himself these days. Now 41, he has spent virtually all of his working life at the FT. He spent much of his journalistic career abroad, in Paris, Korea and Hong Kong, where he was bureau chief. This was in many ways a return to his roots; when he was seven his father&apos;s business relocated to Malaysia and the family lived in Kuala Lumpur, later moving on to Hong Kong and Singapore. Before his Hong Kong appointment Ridding had already shown his management skills as the FT&apos;s managing editor and deputy editor. If those stints had not sufficiently impressed Pearson, the paper&apos;s owner, then his work in setting up the FT in Asia in 2003 certainly did. When he arrived, in the immediate wake of the Sars epidemic, the future looked bleak. He recalls phoning Pearson&apos;s chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, from the empty lobby of the Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong to say: &quot;It&apos;s pretty tough out here. The economy has ground to a standstill.&quot; She told him she remained committed to the strategy. There was a core belief that the FT&apos;s audience was &quot;going global&quot; and this bit of the jigsaw was essential. Though its circulation, at 40,000, appears small, the FT&apos;s Asian edition has already secured the highest readership among international titles across the continent. Then there is the Chinese-language website, launched in 2004, which now has more than 800,000 registered users. Ridding led the development of the site, working closely with Ien Cheng, who is now overseeing the development of the FT site in London. Pearson had enough confidence in his abilities to appoint him as its chairman in Asia. But Ridding seems genuinely modest about his own achievements as he enthuses about the paper&apos;s change in fortunes. Just a couple of years ago commentators were pointing to the FT&apos;s ominous sales problems, particularly in Britain where circulation had slipped close to 100,000. Now it is touching 130,000. There was also a belief that the US operation was a mistake. &quot;We had to take heat on that,&quot; says Ridding. &quot;There were plenty who thought it was way too bold and risky. It hasn&apos;t always been easy but it has worked out well.&quot; So how has the FT pulled itself round? Throughout our conversation he returns to the same themes: staying close to a targeted audience, listening to their needs, stimulating their needs, and then &quot;selling&quot; that audience to advertisers. He says that &quot;the journalistic team are on fire&quot; - pointing to web innovations such as Alphaville, the blog that targets private equity and hedge fund players, and the &quot;view from the top&quot; video interviews - and emphasises the effectiveness of marketing initiatives, particularly the prioritising of subscriptions. But it is the creation of the global franchise that he sees as the key to understanding the paper&apos;s turnaround. It has been important to revenue too, with 74% of the paper&apos;s advertising carried in at least two editions and 50% carried in all four. The How To Spend It magazine, the FT&apos;s home for luxury goods advertisers, is also in rude health. Originally a Saturday supplement, it is now published occasionally on Fridays. But it would be misleading to see the paper&apos;s success through rose-tinted spectacles, even if it is printed on pink paper. Its rise has not been smooth; when the management announced last July that 51 jobs would have to go to accommodate the integration of print and online operations, the reaction from the journalists was unsurprisingly hostile. In announcing the move, Barber - at Ridding&apos;s request - said that if the cuts could not be achieved voluntarily there would be compulsory redundancies. That went down very badly indeed. Ridding chooses his words carefully to explain why the cuts were necessary. &quot;Our industry is clearly in a state of upheaval, and the ability to adapt is crucial,&quot; he says. &quot;The editorial management team had a clear vision of the integrated operation that we need to drive our digital ambitions and worked long and hard on how best to achieve it. That kind of reorganisation is clearly difficult, and painful. But it was handled sensitively and we were able to manage the restructuring entirely through voluntary means.&quot; And neither has every new editorial initiative been a success: FTpm, an afternoon freesheet launched in 2005, was quietly dropped last September, in favour of email alerts and other online developments. In spite of those difficulties, it is clear from FT staff I have spoken to that Ridding is well-liked. They appreciate that, as a former journalist, he understands their problems. There have been persistent rumours that Pearson would like to offload the FT. Until recently it seemed like a logical move - after all, the title was losing money. Analysts now claim (anonymously) that, despite the return to profitability, it does not fit with the rest of the company&apos;s educational publishing portfolio. Ridding brushes aside the speculation. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here if I thought we were going to be sold,&quot; he says. He talks of &quot;substantial&quot; investment in digital innovations and refers to this being &quot;the year of ft.com&quot;. Then there are the other plans to &quot;unleash the brand&quot;, such as the FT&apos;s move into staging conferences. All of this will culminate in an ad campaign in April with the slogan, &quot;We live in financial times&quot;. Ridding is clearly comfortable with his transformation from reporter to chief executive. As he says: &quot;I&apos;m loving it.&quot; But he tells an anecdote which says a lot about his continuing love of journalism and about the FT&apos;s growing status in Asia. At a conference in Dubai he met a vice-chairman of China&apos;s National People&apos;s Congress, Cheng Siwei, who said he thought there was a bubble in the Shanghai market. When that remark appeared in the FT&apos;s Chinese edition the market immediately fell by 5%. Ridding says: &quot;On the one hand I thought, &apos;how fantastic, the power of journalism&apos;. On the other, I wondered how that was going to go down with the Chinese authorities. But we heard nothing back.&quot; It also suggests that the FT&apos;s growing presence in China gives a whole new meaning to C-suite.

That is not something I want on my conscience as a political leader.&quot; Well, it looks as if he is going to have to live with it. Blair has had 10 years in which to tackle Britain&apos;s contribution to global climate change, and he has blown it. His bold initiatives and stirring speeches now look like little more than greenwash. For the first time, we have the figures to prove it. With Channel 4&apos;s series Dispatches, I commissioned a team of environmental scientists at University College, London, to conduct a peer-reviewed audit of the government&apos;s planned greenhouse gas reductions. The scientists, led by Professor Mark Maslin, estimated the real impact of its carbon-cutting policies. Nothing quite like this has ever been done before. The results are staggering. The government has two formal targets for reducing Britain&apos;s climate-changing gases. The first is the one set by the Kyoto protocol, which commits the UK to a 12.5% reduction by 2012. The second is its long-term goal of a 60% cut in carbon dioxide by 2050. This target will be made legally binding later this year. Last year the government&apos;s Energy Review found that to show &quot;real progress&quot; towards the 2050 target, by 2020 the UK&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions would need to be reduced to between 143 and 149m tonnes a year. This means a cut of 29 to 31% on 1990 levels. We asked Maslin&apos;s team to assess the policies that are supposed to deliver it. For an audit, the 2020 aim is more useful than the 2050 target. If we are to have a realistic chance of hitting it, the necessary policies must already be in place or in development. While the Blair government would be only partly responsible if we fail to make 60% by 2050, it will carry almost all the blame if we do not reach its milestone in 2020. Our audit reveals that the government&apos;s assessment of its own policies is wildly optimistic. Instead of a 29-31% cut by 2020, it is on course to deliver a reduction of between 12% and 17%. At this rate the UK will not meet its 2020 milestone until 2050. This result suggests that the government&apos;s claim to be &quot;leading the world on tackling climate change&quot; is simply another product of the Downing Street spin machine. Its carbon-cutting policies are little more than a sham. Take transport, for example. The government expects that national transport emissions (not counting international flights) will rise by 4m tonnes between 1990 and 2020. Maslin&apos;s team discovered that the real increase will be between 7 and 13m tonnes. Faced with a vocal and powerful motoring lobby, Blair&apos;s government has sought to cut emissions in three ways, all of which are failing. The first is a voluntary agreement, struck in Brussels with the major motor manufacturers. In 1998, the car makers promised they would reduce the average emissions from new cars from 190 to 140 grams per kilometre in 10 years. The deadline is next year, and they will miss their target by half: the real figure is likely to be 164 grams. The second mechanism is the tax we pay to put a car on the road - vehicle excise duty (VED). In 2001, the government replaced the flat rate for VED with a graduated tax. Owners of the most fuel-hungry cars would have to pay more than owners of efficient models. Seven bands were introduced, starting with A (for cars that produce less than 100 grams per kilometre) and rising to G (for those producing more than 225 grams). A survey carried out by the Department for Transport found that to encourage most drivers to switch to a less polluting model, you would need a difference between the bands of at least \u00a3150. The government&apos;s Sustainable Development Commission went further: if the tax were to be really effective, the top whack should be \u00a31,800. But the government&apos;s top rate is \u00a3215, and the average difference between the bands \u00a335. When you are shelling out \u00a365,000 for a Range Rover, is that really going to make a difference? The third policy is to encourage us to switch to biofuels - diesel or alcohol made from plants. By 2010, the government wants 5% of all our transport fuels to be made this way. By 2020, the EU wants to raise this to 20%. But there are two massive problems, which the government consistently refuses to address. The first is that beyond a certain point, the production of fuel begins to compete directly with the production of food. A study conducted last year by Sarasin, a Swiss bank placed &quot;the present limit for the environmentally and socially responsible use of biofuels at roughly 5% of current petrol and diesel consumption in the EU and US&quot;. Already, when only a tiny fraction of our transport fuel comes from plants, the UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation reports that the demand for biofuels has helped to cause a &quot;surge in the prices of cereals&quot; to &quot;levels not seen for a decade&quot;. All over the world, the poor are feeling the effect. The second problem is that the new market has stimulated a massive expansion of destructive plantations, especially of oil palm. Palm oil planting is the major cause of tropical deforestation in both Malaysia and Indonesia. As the forests are cut down, the carbon in both the trees and the peat they grow on turns into carbon dioxide. A study by the Dutch scientific consultancy Delft Hydraulics found that the production of every tonne of palm oil causes 33 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. This makes oil palm 10 times worse than petroleum. Already nine new palm oil refineries are being built, in Malaysia, Singapore and Rotterdam, specifically to meet the growing demand from the European biofuel market. The government urges us not to worry - a &quot;second generation&quot; of biofuels will eventually become available, made from straw, wood and waste. But there is no guarantee that these will out-compete their cheap but destructive rivals, or that they will be ready before the last rain-forests in south-east Asia have been felled. In every sector the audit found similar oversights, elisions and deceptions. In housing, for example, the government has loudly proclaimed its intention to use better building regulations to make new houses more energy efficient - by 2016, it says, every new home in the country will be &quot;zero carbon&quot;. But since the energy efficiency regulations were first introduced in 1985 there has not been a single prosecution for non-compliance. Building inspectors treat the energy rules as a joke - in one recent survey they dismissed them as &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;not life threatening&quot;. A study by the Building Research Establishment of new houses passed by the inspectors found that 43% of them did not meet satisfactory energy standards. But the biggest greenwash of all involves flying. Under the Kyoto protocol, the pollution from international flights does not count towards a country&apos;s emissions. The government has taken this as a licence to ignore flying even when setting its own targets. The emissions simply do not appear on the balance sheet. Otherwise it could not justify its instruction to the UK&apos;s airports to double their capacity between now and 2030. Because they were assessing the government&apos;s own programme, the auditors didn&apos;t produce figures for aviation. But even the government proposes that carbon emissions from planes will rise by 10.5m tonnes between 1990 and 2020. Had it been incorporated into the audit, this figure would have reduced the cuts for the whole economy by 2020 to between 8 and 13%. But the government&apos;s figure is almost certainly a wild underestimate. It counts only half the emissions from planes flying to and from our airports, on the grounds that only half the passengers belong to this country. In reality, 67% are UK citizens. It also ignores the other greenhouse gases - especially high-level water vapour - that flying produces. If increases in international flights were counted in the national total, they could wipe out all the cuts in the UK&apos;s emissions between 1990 and 2020. What makes these failures most shocking is that Blair&apos;s government took office in 1997 with a massive head start. When John Major left office, the UK was one of the few nations on course to meet its Kyoto commitments, with plenty of emissions to spare. That advantage has already been squandered. Today the UK is turning out slightly more carbon dioxide than it was in 1997 (though other greenhouse gases have declined) and we will just scrape in beneath the 2012 Kyoto bar, while on course for dramatically missing our 2020 and 2050 targets. Instead of real action to deal with the greatest menace of the 21st century, the government has sold us a set of fake policies, designed to make us feel better about ourselves, without political pain.

The confirmed death toll thus far from the quakes was 70, Indonesia&apos;s cabinet secretary, Sudi Silalahi, told reporters in Jakarta. Centred on Sumatra&apos;s west coast, the first earthquake at around 11am local time (4am UK time) measured 6.3 on the Richter scale. As well as a series of smaller aftershocks, a second major tremor, measuring 6.0, shook the same area two hours later. The quakes were felt as far away as Singapore, 250 miles to the north. The worst affected place appeared to be the town of Solok on Sumatra&apos;s west coast, directly above the epicentre of the quake, as identified by the US Geological Survey. &quot;Our priority is to handle the injured, including their families.

However, there was no tsunami after this quake, as it was centred on land. According to local officials, at least nine people were killed in Solok, including some young children who died when a two-storey building collapsed onto a playground. Another witness, in the town of Payahkumbuh, said several two-storey shops in the main street had collapsed and police and soldiers were digging for survivors.

On Java, a commercial jetliner burst into flames as it landed in the early hours of this morning. The plane was said to be carrying 140 people, including a number Australian journalists and diplomatic staff who were in Indonesia with the country&apos;s foreign minister, Alexander Downer. Mr Downer was reportedly not on the plane which landed at Yogyakarta airport in central Java. &quot;It is true that a plane caught fire while landing. It happened when it overshot beyond the runway and burst into flames,&quot; Yogyakarta provincial secretary Bambang Susanto said. &quot;The number of passengers is still unclear but we know that there are passengers being treated at the air force hospital,&quot; he added. A local Islamic leader, Dien Syamsudin, said before the plane landed it was shaking. Yesterday, rescue teams rushed to Sumatra to assess the extent of the damage around the provincial capital of Padang, where telephone and power lines were cut, and roads damaged. Terrified people fled screaming from offices, schools and homes when the quake hit at 10.49am. A series of deadly earthquakes - including the devastating tsunami of December 2004 that killed 130,000 in northern Sumatra alone - has left Indonesians edgy. Several hours after the quake an aftershock registering a magnitude of 6.0, according the US Geological Survey, caused further damage to buildings and triggered fresh panic. Many had already taken to the streets to find open ground away from buildings as Indonesian government emergency training had schooled them to do. Some initially sought higher ground amid fears of another tsunami. Traffic jams and damaged roads hampered the efforts of rescuers and those attempting to assess the scale of the devastation. But television pictures from the four districts affected showed piles of twisted concrete debris and badly damaged buildings. Hospitals in some areas were overwhelmed by the number of casualties. In Padang the authorities put up tents on sports grounds to shelter the injured and offer some protection from the risk of further aftershocks. The earthquake&apos;s epicentre was about 30 miles north-east of Padang, near the town of Solok. But the tremors were felt in Malaysia, and buildings in Singapore&apos;s financial district were evacuated when they shook. &quot;I thought it was a big vehicle passing through in front of the house,&quot; said Misbadi, 50, a Solok resident who suffered a broken arm. &quot;I ran out of the house but I was hit by a collapsing building&quot;.

This all-weather court was latterly the turf of Bill Threlfall, Hurlingham&apos;s venerable pro and pioneer television tennis commentator, who has died aged 81. Here Threlfall would wait, Satanic smile in place, undeterred by sleet or wind, for his tubby and clueless patients, myself included. Until a recent angioplasty forced a reluctant reform, he was smoking enthusiastically and surprisingly heavily for a serious sportsman. Not at all debauched by the modern conventions of political correctness, he had (with the exception of maddeningly early morning calls to confirm a match) immaculate manners - and expected them in others. He offered a direct connection to olden days. He absolutely always, whatever the circumstances, saw the funny side of things. He was born in Penang, Malaya, where his father, a colonial official, had been tennis champion &quot;about 25 times&quot;, and was educated at Brighton and Hove grammar school. In 1943, just days after his 18th birthday, he joined the Fleet Air Arm. It was what his family expected. The navy sent him to Canada to learn to fly, first in a Tiger Moth, then Harvards, Barracudas and Seafires (a carrier-borne Spitfire). By all accounts, he was brave, stylish and reckless in the air. He spent most of the war in the Orkneys looking for enemy submarines, and later in the Far East, where he trained to dive-bomb Japanese defences in Singapore. Hiroshima disappointed him because it thwarted the opportunity for an old-fashioned fight. After the war he became a helicopter instructor. This astonished his friends, because the three-dimensional spatial disciplines required of a helicopter pilot were at odds with the evidence of his badly parked and anarchically damaged cars. He left the service at 39 after 22 years, with the rank of lieutenant-commander. Threlfall then towed a caravan around Europe and north Africa, becoming a maestro di tennis in a sports club at Ospedaletti, near Ventimiglia, on the Italian continuation of the C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur, in 1967. The plaque still hangs in the Hurlingham pros&apos; office. His commentating career had started the previous year, when ITV was covering Wimbledon. His authority was superlative and his dry wit merciless. He understood tennis completely, and spared no one. Fools he did not suffer, champions included. The stars adored him. He was a person of fixed habits and attitudes: the same hotels in the Algarve and Menton were unnegotiable. John McEnroe he regarded as a brilliant, unruly child. He was a good player on his own account: Royal Navy men&apos;s singles champion a record eight times. In 1952, he played at Wimbledon in the mixed doubles with Jean Petchell, but went out in the first round to the Australians Ken Rosewall and Beryl Penrose in two sets. Much later, he won the National Veterans&apos; championship five times. His broadcasting work continued with the BBC, first radio and, from 1974, television, and finally with Sky Sports. This summer would have been his 42nd as a Wimbledon commentator. I knew him as a coach. It was an expensive way to hit balls, but cheap as therapy. Occasionally, I offered him a challenging ball, and he responded with a brilliantly unlikely cross-court return which made me shriek &quot;Evil old bastard!&quot;. This he loved. He was good-humoured and mercilessly critical all at the same time. In bad weather, he wore an awful bobble hat; in good, terrible Elvis shades. He explained Bernoulli&apos;s theorem in an attempt to teach top spin. He was indefatigably playing tennis until a week before he died. Despite - or because of - my stubborn refusal to improve my game, Threlfall took an indulgent interest in me as a project. I told him he was merely turning &quot;crap into mediocrity&quot;, an expression he loved. I also tried to infiltrate other bons mots to his television commentary. When he died he was still working on memorising Napoleon&apos;s advice to &quot;never interrupt an enemy while he is making a mistake&quot;. He is survived by his wife Anne and their daughter. Richard Evans writes: In the 1980s, when I was part of the BBC television team at Wimbledon, I often found myself shunted out to some distant court with Bill Threlfall as my summariser. He was well qualified for the role and did not spare the players if their technique failed to live up to his demanding standards. But although he could be tough with his observations, touches of humour were always likely to be sprinkled around his comments. Throwing fellow commentators in at the deep end was one of his party tricks. I was the fall guy on one occasion when a sudden change of schedule sent the two of us scurrying over to the old No 1 court at Wimbledon to cover a women&apos;s doubles totally unprepared. To our horror, we looked at the four young ladies happily hitting up and realised that they might have dropped from the moon for all we knew about them. &quot;So Richard, you travel the world watching all these players, why don&apos;t you give us a run down of the four ladies we have here for this third-round match.&quot; Spluttering, giggling and speechless for the best part of a minute, I eventually got sufficient control of myself to read out the names and nationalities straight off the official programme. So much for inside knowledge. A meticulous researcher, Threlfall became a respected voice of reason and common sense in tennis. However, his method of proposal when it came to marriage did not quite fit that description. Before popping the question to Wren Anne Rivaz, he took his future bride up in a two-seater Royal Navy Meteor trainer. &quot;Then I did a roll and flew it upside down and asked her to marry me,&quot; Bill chuckled. &quot;She said she would as long as I promised to fly the damn thing the right way up.&quot; \u00b7 William Winn Threlfall, tennis coach and commentator, born April 24 1925; died March 7 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/12/china.internationalnews", "sentences": ["&quot;From a technical standpoint, it is realistic,&quot; Richard Pinkham, a Singapore-based analyst with the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, told the Associated Press."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-12T16:38:39Z", "title": "China to challenge Boeing and Airbus", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "China plans to produce its own large commercial jet by 2020 to challenge the dominance of Airbus and Boeing in the world&apos;s fastest-growing aircraft market, the state media reported today.

He was appointed Lancashire captain in 1947 without having played a first-class match, made his England debut after only 13 appearances, took over as captain for his fifth Test when Gubby Allen was injured, then retired to the family&apos;s dentistry practice in Liverpool at the end of the following season. In 1988 he explained to the late Brian Bearshaw, the Manchester Evening News cricket correspondent who was researching his official history of Lancashire CCC, the motivation behind a first-class career comprising only 78 appearances, eight of which were Tests. &quot;I wanted to prove myself,&quot; said Cranston, a stroke-making batsman and seam bowler, who also played hockey for the county. &quot;I knew I was a reasonable player and it is only by playing first-class cricket that you find out just how good you are. I did enough in that short time to satisfy myself. I went to the West Indies at the end of my first season and it was all an anti-climax after that. I had a family growing up and I wanted to establish myself in dentistry.&quot; Cranston, the son of an Aigburth dentist, had played for Lancashire&apos;s second XI in the Minor Counties Championship before the war, confirming the all-round talent he had shown at Liverpool College - where the pavilion is named after him and his elder brother Ronald, another gifted sportsman who died aged 23 - and also in universities matches and as a club player for Neston in the Liverpool competition. He also played for the forces during his war service as a dental officer in the navy, gaining the nickname &quot;Toothy&quot;, and witnessed the Japanese surrender to Lord Mountbatten in Singapore. In 1947, he accepted an offer to captain Lancashire as an amateur, after Jack Fallows&apos; sacking. His father agreed to look after the Aigburth dentistry practice. He took five wickets and made 47 to set up a victory over Kent on his debut, and steady performances with his lively seam bowling plus a couple of half-centuries - the first of them against Glamorgan at Aigburth - were enough to earn him an England call for the third Test against South Africa at Old Trafford. After a solid debut in a win set up by Bill Edrich and Denis Compton, he retained his place to take four wickets in six balls and hasten the tourists towards another defeat in the fourth Test at Headingley. Those figures of four for 12 remained his best for England, and with his first season as captain ending with 1,228 runs at an average of 33.18, 83 wickets at 22.81, and his Lancashire team third in the County Championship, he was selected for the MCC&apos;s winter tour to the West Indies. With Allen deputising for Norman Yardley, who had business commitments, Cranston was appointed vice-captain. After Allen, then 45, pulled a muscle on the voyage out, Cranston led the MCC in the first two tour matches in Barbados followed by the Test, which ended in a draw, despite Jim Laker&apos;s nine wickets. Allen was fit for the second Test in Trinidad, leaving Cranston as one of eight players in the 20th century to have led England in a single Test, a list joined most recently by Chris Cowdrey (in 1988) and Mark Butcher (1999). Cranston took four for 78 and batted better than most as England lost the third Test in Guyana, but after West Indies completed a 2-0 series victory in Jamaica he was one of several players who lost their places for the start of the home Ashes series the following summer. He was recalled for the fourth Test at Headingley with Bradman&apos;s Australians already 2-0 up, but made a duck in the second innings, his last for England, before the tourists famously made 404 for three to win, with Bradman contributing an unbeaten 173. Though Cranston did claim Keith Miller lbw as his 18th and last Test wicket, the Australians were on 396 for two at the time. After only eight more appearances for Lancashire, and despite the county&apos;s attempts to persuade him to stay on, Cranston went back to dentistry, although he made four more first-class appearances in festival matches at Scarborough, hitting a career-best 156 not out for the MCC against Yorkshire in 1949. He continued to take a keen interest in Lancashire through the Players&apos; Association, of which he was the senior statesman, and was appointed president of the club in 1993-94. He is survived by his second wife Joanne, who he met at Formby cricket club, where she was serving tea, their son Jonathan and by a daughter Diana and son Anthony from his first marriage, which ended in divorce. \u00b7 Kenneth Cranston, cricketer, born October 20 1917; died January 8 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/13/news1", "sentences": ["In Greece, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, it accounted for over 50% of cinema tickets sold."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-13T09:28:51Z", "title": "Grant and Barrymore make sweet music at the box office", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "article": "Music &amp; Lyrics, the romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, hit all the right notes at the worldwide box-office this week to reach the number one spot.

More than you might think, Tim. First up, there is former West Ham midfielder Alan Devonshire and his county neighbour Luke Cornwall, who plied his trade at Fulham, Bradford and Woking. Moving along the south coast, we arrive at Andy Sussex (Leyton Orient, Crewe and Southend, among others), Kevin Kent (Port Vale) and then Lee Norfolk (Ipswich). &quot;Sporting the name of our deadly rivals&apos; home county was a controversial move, but he was from New Zealand, so all was forgiven,&quot; writes Csaba Abrahall. Doing his county proud, on the other hand, was Graham Lancashire, who enjoyed stints at Burnley, Preston, Wigan and Rochdale. If we extend the parameters of the question, however, we can trawl up several other examples. Pat O&apos;Connell and Paul McGrath helped us compile an exhaustive list of Irish counties represented in the leagues. Brighton&apos;s Kerry Mayo takes the prize with two, while others include Dion Dublin (Cambridge, Man Utd, Coventry, etc), Keith Dublin (Brighton, Watford, Southend), Kerry Mayo (Brighton), Paul Mayo (Lincoln), Shaun Derry (Crystal Palace, Leeds), Alan Cork (Wimbledon, Sheffield United), Jack Cork (Bournemouth, Chelsea), Lloyd Kerry (Sheffield United), Neil Kilkenny (Birmingham), Rob Clare (Blackpool, Stockport) and Daryl Clare (Grimsby, Northampton, Chester, Boston). For Scottish alternatives, there are Terry Angus (Northampton, Fulham), Stevland Angus (Cambridge) and John Angus (Burnley). Sadly we have failed to find any Welsh examples. FOOTBALL&apos;S SULKIEST WALK-OFFS? (2) A couple of weeks ago we looked into the game&apos;s biggest toys-out-of-the-pram moments, but it seems several incidents of infamy passed us by ... &quot;The most famous walk-off in Uruguayan football history happened in the derby between Pe\u00f1arol and Nacional in 1949,&quot; writes Pablo Miguez. &quot;In the first half Pe\u00f1arol scored twice and Nacional had two players sent off. It is not clear whether it was the players or the chairmen who took the decision, but Nacional did not play the second half and retired. They claimed the referee was not capable of doing a good job, accusing him of incorrectly awarding the penalty that resulted in the second goal and of punching one of their players. A more recent walk-off happened in 2005 between River Plate (unrelated to the Argentinian giants) and Danubio; when the River keeper was on the ground, the referee did not stop the game and Danubio scored. The assistant coach became furious, and told their players to retire, which they did.&quot; Dan Ghica recalls another instance, this time from the 1988 Romanian Cup final, when things got ugly between Bucharest rivals Dinamo and Steaua. &quot;Dinamo scored a controversial equaliser in the final minute and Steaua refused to play extra-time and walked off, leaving the TV commentator in an amusing state of bewilderment and panic (Romania was a totalitarian Communist country at the time and such outrageous events were not supposed to happen). The referee gave the match to Dinamo, who were awarded the trophy, but these final scenes were not shown on TV as the broadcast had been interrupted. Steaua contested the result and, owing to their superior political influence, were awarded the trophy by the Romanian FA (Ceausescu himself was rumoured to have made the final decision). In 1990, after Ceausescu was overthrown, Steaua formally renounced the 1988 Romanian Cup trophy, which is now officially not awarded for that year.&quot; &quot;I can&apos;t believe you missed the biggest prima donnas of the lot,&quot; adds an unimpressed Jonathan Park. Sorry, Jonathan. &quot;AC Milan and their infamous 1991 European Cup strop at Marseille, prompted by the floodlights failing momentarily with Milan trailing 1-0 and with only two minutes on the clock. Milan were handed a one-year ban from the competition for their toy tossing.&quot; James Calder is equally miffed. &quot;I can&apos;t believe you didn&apos;t mention Rapid Vienna&apos;s infamous shenanigans at a Cup Winners&apos; Cup match against Celtic at Parkhead in 1984-85,&quot; he writes. &quot;After losing the first leg 3-1 in Vienna and despite the Austrian side&apos;s gamesmanship and outright thuggery, Celtic were 3-0 up with just minutes left when an empty whisky bottle was hurled on to the pitch. Although television pictures were inconclusive, it was shown lying on the ground near one of the Rapid players, who was rolling around theatrically \u00e0 la Rojas. Rapid then tried to walk off and have the game abandoned but the referee overruled them and play resumed. Celtic thought they had won through to the next round but the Austrians appealed to Uefa, who, to their eternal shame, ordered a replay at Old Trafford, where Rapid won through 1-0. They eventually lost in the final 3-1 to Everton.&quot; Last, but not least, is Thailand&apos;s recent strop in the first leg of the Asean Championships final against Singapore, where they stormed off the field for 15 minutes in protest at a dubious penalty decision with eight minutes remaining. The Thais eventually returned and Mustafic Fahrudin fired home from the spot, but that didn&apos;t stop team manager Tawatchai Sajakul defending the decision to leave the field. &quot;We have all calmed down now, but there&apos;s something seriously wrong about the decision of the referee,&quot; said Tawatchai. &quot;We have a right to protest and we needed to get the message across that we have been unfairly treated.&quot; In the end, the second leg ended 1-1, giving Singapore a victory over petulance. WORLDS APART &quot;Do you have any idea what happened with the footballing careers of the kids who finished second and third - Mark Price and Dean Lonsdale - behind David Beckham in the 1986 Bobby Charlton Soccer School Skills finals?&quot; enquires Iain Harral. &quot;My footballing career was somewhat less glamorous than David&apos;s,&quot; begins the aforementioned Dean Lonsdale, who kindly got in touch with us. &quot;I continued playing for a number of years after the BCSC and enjoyed time playing for Blackpool schoolboys and the Blackpool representative squad. I was lucky enough to have a trial with Watford in the early 90s, but nothing came of that so I took the road of playing for local West Lancs sides before retiring from the game in 2000, when my son was born. He now plays and we hope that he can progress a little further than his dad.&quot; Can anyone help us with a lead on what happened to Mark Price? Then let us know at the usual address. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Is it true that the clothes designer Daniel Hechter once created PSG&apos;s kit/club colours?&quot; queried David Jordan in 2005. It is indeed true David, as Monsieur Hechter was in fact once the club chairman, having invested a fair few francs in the his hometown side. Hechter assumed the role of PSG&apos;s chairman in 1973, when they were still an amateur outfit. He remained in charge until 1978, by which stage the club&apos;s rise into the upper echelon of European football was well under way. Regarding the clobber, legend has it that Hechter was so impressed by Ajax&apos;s eye-catching strip, he used it as the inspiration for PSG&apos;s kit, though he obviously changed the colour to match the French flag.

Mohammed expressed sorrow for those who had died in the attacks and said that he &quot;did not like to kill children&quot; but that &quot;in war there were always victims&quot;. The apparent confession was contained in a 26-page transcript of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, which the Pentagon released last night as part of the procedures of the closed-door sessions with 14 terror suspects. Mohammed has long been alleged to have played a key role in the conceiving and organising of 9/11, but never before has there been what is said to be his own admission. According to the Pentagon transcript, he told the tribunal panel of three military officers and a government-provided representative on Saturday that he admitted responsibility for the attacks on September 11 as well as a string of other outrages, including the bombing of a nightclub in Bali and an attempt to bring two American planes down, using shoe bombs. &quot;I was responsible for the 9/11 operation, from A to Z. I was the operational director for Sheikh Usama [Osama] bin Laden for the organising, planning, follow-up and execution of the 9/11 operation,&quot; he allegedly confesses through his personal representative. He allegedly also confesses to being a member of the al-Qaida council and the &quot;military operational commander for all foreign operations&quot;. These include surveying the assassination of former American presidents, including Jimmy Carter, and planning to bomb suspension bridges in New York. In all, he has allegedly confessed to being responsible for 31 separate attacks or planned attacks, including ones on Heathrow airport, Canary Wharf and Big Ben in London. It is not clear why Mohammed would have wished to confess to such a wide-ranging number of outrages. The alleged confession is likely, however, to stiffen the resolve of the Bush administration in pursuing its controversial policy of putting the biggest cases of suspected terrorism through the closed military hearings. The procedures have come under intense criticism from human rights groups on the grounds that the defendants are not entitled to normal rights of legal representation, and the hearings are closed to public scrutiny. A separate transcript of another top al-Qaida suspect, Abi Faraj al-Libi, also released last night, contains a statement from him in which he refuses to cooperate with the proceedings. &quot;I have been held by the United States for over two years without any indication of how the judicial system is going to deal with my situation. It is my opinion the detainee is in a lose-lose situation,&quot; the transcript reads. Mohammed refused to take the oath before addressing the military tribunal, as he said that to do so would be to recognise the system. But he said that did not imply he intended to lie to the officials present. In broken English, he likened al-Qaida to the founding fathers of the US and Bin Laden to George Washington. &quot;We and George Washington doing same thing,&quot; he allegedly said. If he were alive now, Washington would be called an enemy combatant - his designation in Guant\u00e1namo - by Britain. He expressed sorrow for those who died on 9/11: &quot;When I said I&apos;m not happy that 3,000 been killed in America, I feel sorry even. I don&apos;t like to kill children.&quot; But he went on to accuse the US of double standards, saying America made an exception of the rule when it killed people in Iraq. &quot;You said we have to do it. We don&apos;t like Saddam. But this is the way to deal with Saddam.&quot; His conclusion: &quot;Same language you use, I use.&quot; The 9/11 commission concluded of Mohammed that he was &quot;highly educated and equally comfortable in a government office or a terrorist safehouse, KSM applied his imagination, technical aptitude and managerial skills to hatching and planning an extraordinary array of terrorist schemes. These included car bombing, political assassination, aircraft bombing, hijacking, reservoir poisoning, and, ultimately, the use of aircraft as missiles guided by suicide operatives.&quot; Time magazine reported last October that he had been the one to personally wield the knife that killed the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The FBI was closely involved in his arrest in Rawalpindi in March 2003 and along with the CIA took over his detention and interrogation in secret locations. He is understood to have gone through torture, including &quot;waterboarding&quot; when the suspect being interrogated is strapped to a board and placed underwater. According to the New York Times, the use of harsh techniques was approved in his case by the justice department and the CIA. Along with 13 other suspects, Mohammed was moved to Guant\u00e1namo last September, partly as an attempt by the US administration to assuage anxieties about the CIA&apos;s secret interrogation camps.

The fighting began when 500 armed police tried to enter villages in the Nandigram area, 80 miles south of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), to be met by farmers and activists armed with sickles and machetes behind barricades of upturned vehicles and palm-logs. It was the first time police had tried to gain access since January, when clashes left six people dead. &quot;My men came under fire and were attacked with home-made bombs. They came out firing and my officers returned fire,&quot; Inspector-General Raj Kanojia said. The state&apos;s Communist government has ordered some 22,000 acres (9,000 hectares) to be turned over to a special economic zone for an Indonesian-owned petrochemical complex. Such zones would, like those in China, offer industry tax- and duty-free areas free from government red tape. The impetus lies with India&apos;s desire to match China&apos;s lightning and sustained economic growth. However, China&apos;s three-decade-long race for development has left at least 40 million landless peasants, generating much resentment in the countryside which often boils over. Despite their rapid economic growth India and China still rely on the land to provide for hundreds of millions of poor farmers. The cost of such special zones to the Indian taxpayer is put at 1,750bn rupees (\u00a321bn) by 2011. However, the government has said the benefits are considerable, and would bring in \u00a37bn in investment and create almost a million jobs. &quot;This is not a very good way of creating jobs,&quot; said Shankar Archarya, a central government economic adviser. &quot;It would be better to do away with India&apos;s labour laws. Even in [special economic zones] you will not be able to shut down a factory with 100 workers in it without government permission ... the Chinese do not have the same labour restrictions.&quot; The corporate subsidies have attracted international interest. Since it passed a law in 2005 approving the zones the government has approved 60 sites, although the earlier violence in West Bengal had put a further 300 applications on hold. Many plots are for luxury private housing and for software companies keen to buy new premises. One zone in West Bengal aims to build a &quot;people&apos;s car&quot; which would cost less than \u00a31,500. The violence has prompted questions as to whether India&apos;s democracy can sustain the pursuit of a Chinese-style industrial revolution. Once the zones have been approved, farmland is bought, sometimes through compulsory state acquisitions. &quot;You are telling a poor tiller of the land that his livelihood will disappear and that if you wait for 15 years he might get a job in a new factory. It is not going to be acceptable,&quot; said Ashok Mitra, a former chief economic adviser. Some experts say the compensation scheme has only bought off landowners and not the peasants who work the land. The Indian Statistics Institute said a landlord received 1.3m rupees an acre in West Bengal while sharecroppers only received a quarter of that sum, with agricultural labourers granted nothing. &quot;No wonder you have a peasant uprising,&quot; said the institute&apos;s Professor Abhirup Sarkar. &quot;It is bad economics and looks like bad politics too.&quot; Special economic zones Special economic zones are a US invention. In 1947 Washington boosted the prospects of Puerto Rico, which is part of the US Commonwealth, with industrial parks that attracted tax breaks. In the 1960s SEZs helped Taiwan grow from rural backwater to chip-maker to the world. Zones cropped up in Singapore and Korea in the 1970s and 80s. In Mexico maquiladoras - tariff-free factories - send billions of dollars of goods across the US border and are credited with creating a million jobs in a decade. China opened its first SEZ in 1980.

The main part of the transcript from the unclassified section of the tribunal was released yesterday. According to that, Mr Mohammed confessed to being the mastermind behind the September 11 2001 attacks in the US, as well as carrying out or planning dozens of other plots. The section of the transcript about Pearl&apos;s killing was held back to allow time for the journalist&apos;s family to be notified, the Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said.

And, at one level, it is indeed just that; but it is also a subtle examination of the concept of heroism, of what it is that makes young men risk their lives, and why - especially in the climate of that time, although of course in the era of Iraq and Afghanistan, the language of heroism is still very much around. The story is told by Grace, now in her eighties and the bitter, perplexed widow of Leo Waterhouse, who was beheaded by the Japanese after an abortive attempt to repeat a successful raid on shipping in Singapore harbour. It is told also by Leo himself, whose diaries of both the first raid - &quot;Cornflakes&quot; - and the second - &quot;Memerang&quot; - have conveniently survived, the first found in an office drawer after the war, the second, scrawled on toilet paper during captivity, brought to Grace by the Japanese interpreter who gave some solace to the captured men. Grace herself comments that Leo wrote in the style of a boy&apos;s adventure story. True up to a point, but my own feeling was that the toilet-paper manuscript did not quite ring true - too expansive, without the tension that the circumstances would have induced. This strikes a rare false note, for in general the elegance and economy of this novel are dazzling - the atmosphere of the late 1940s brought to life through a handful of vibrant characters and their interactions. Leo looks like Errol Flynn. While he and his comrades are off on their first mission, Grace and the other waiting girls haunt the cinema, their longing for the beautiful, doomed boys nourished by the gung-ho movies of the day. In old age, she looks back with a different vision: angry, puzzled, questioning. It seems to her that Leo met an obscene death &quot;for very little purpose&quot;. The military purpose had been to blow up shipping in Singapore harbour with limpet mines. The Cornflakes raid (so called because the Japanese would not be able to enjoy their breakfast the next morning) was a dramatic success, conceived and led by the charismatic &quot;Boss&quot; Charlie Doucette. The men make their way from Australia to Singapore in a customised fishing boat packed with limpet mines, plant the explosives, watch the resulting carnage in exaltation, and are picked up by submarine for the return to a heroes&apos; welcome - though a subdued one, since this triumph cannot be made general news: a follow-up is intended. Such missions become legend. Keneally acknowledges in a postscript that his story owes a debt to two real-life wartime operations against Singapore, &quot;Jaywick&quot; and &quot;Rimau&quot;, and cites his sources, which he has used deftly - the shadow of the card-index is absent. Rather, he has been able to give the novel convincing ballast, with enough details to stop the reader wondering just how this was done or that avoided, while conjuring up the mind-set of the day by way of his characters. There is decent, daring Leo, the obsessive, half-crazed Doucette, the debonair Englishman Rufus Mortmain, and his wife Dotty, older and more worldly than Grace, who arrives at her wedding &quot;smelling of cloves, lavender and gin&quot;. Dotty has literary inclinations; she gives Grace &quot;The Waste Land&quot; to read, thus slipping a telling reference into the novel. Elsewhere Mortmain is found reading The Odyssey during the Cornflakes mission, and at the very end Leo and the other doomed men rehearse and perform The Devil&apos;s Disciple in their prison cell. The Devil&apos;s Disciple is, of course, about selfless sacrifice, and the last section of the novel turns on the evidence that appears decades later, including that wad of toilet paper. Wartime politics intrude - the mistrust between Australians and Americans - when the soft-spoken US Colonel Creed attempts to interfere with the plans for the second and fatal attempt on Singapore harbour. There have been betrayals, some of them self-serving. But, most of all, the assumptions of that time seem as archaic as the complacency of Empire. Grace remembers how Doucette used to recite Tennyson at parties: &quot;Some work of noble note, may yet be done ...&quot; She sees the men as living according to Tennyson, whereas she and Dotty would live in the age of Auden and TS Eliot. She is tormented by the thought that bravery was its own end, that the purpose was to be brave, even to be doomed. This clever, compelling novel asks some uncomfortable questions. \u00b7 Penelope Lively&apos;s Making It Up is published by Penguin"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/mar/17/weekend7.weekend1", "sentences": ["Instead, on National Service in Singapore in 1956, he acquired a cheap roll camera and exposed a few frames."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-17T17:24:47Z", "title": "Two take Manhattan", "tags": [], "article": "These uncomplicated pictures, taken on the streets of Manhattan over a few sunless January days, spearheaded the British invasion of America. At the dawn of 1962, before the miniskirt and the classless &quot;pop-ocracy&quot; of the Beatles and the Stones, there was David Bailey and Jean Shrimpton. Their significance did not go unnoticed, at least not by the then editor-in-chief of American Vogue, Diana Vreeland. When she met them, tired and cold and not looking their best having failed to flag down a cab, she proclaimed, &quot;But they are adorable! England. Has. Arrived.&quot; Back at home, the partnership of Bailey and Shrimpton was not yet the stuff of legend - it was barely a year old - but it was attracting attention. At 24, Bailey saw himself as something of an outsider: &quot;Being a cockney was no help in the beginning, only after 65. I remember one of those women patting me on the head and saying, &apos;Oh, doesn&apos;t he speak cute?&apos; &quot;&apos;I&apos;ll give you cute&apos;,&quot; he vowed as the editors continued patting his head up and down the corridors of Vogue. It is certainly true that his upbringing did not prepare him for a career in photography, far less fashion photography, the milieu of a privileged elite. &quot;I could be either a jazz musician, an actor or a car thief,&quot; he once said, surveying the opportunities open to an East Ham teenager in the 50s. He wasn&apos;t brave enough for larceny, acting was just &quot;talking posh&quot; and his great love, ornithology, would get him nowhere fast. Instead, on National Service in Singapore in 1956, he acquired a cheap roll camera and exposed a few frames. On his return, photography became a career and Vogue beckoned (though only just: Woman&apos;s Own paid more). By now, Bailey&apos;s father considered him &quot;queer as a coot&quot;. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Jean Shrimpton from Buckinghamshire, a graduate of the Lucie Clayton Modelling School and fresh to Vogue, put it more airily: she was, she declared, &quot;as green as a spring salad&quot;. Bailey and Shrimpton first worked together in 1960 at Brides, a testing ground for Vogue photographers. They hit it off and from then on he fought for her. He nearly jeopardised a big chance at Vogue - 14 pages of celebrity-led fashion for September 1961 - by insisting on Shrimpton as model. Fashion editor Lady Clare Rendlesham, equally stubborn and alarmingly forbidding, refused. Bailey dug in further. In the end, Rendlesham gave in. &quot;I was intent on delivering the goods,&quot; Shrimpton said. &quot;I wanted to prove Lady Rendlesham wrong.&quot; The sitting made Bailey&apos;s name and a trip to New York was pencilled in for January - with Rendlesham as editor and chaperone. &quot;I wanted Jean,&quot; Bailey says. &quot;She was just about everything to me then. I put everything of me into her. She was my total muse - I didn&apos;t want to look ...; at another model. There was a sort of magic there. She had a democratic kind of beauty, one that no one could possibly object to. Kate Moss has it. Other supermodels can just scare you. They are too beautiful. Everyone loved Jean.&quot; Bailey&apos;s first trip abroad for the magazine was clearly an accolade, but also something of a probationary exercise. Vogue, smelling revolution in the air, was unsure of what it was unleashing: &quot;Remember, David,&quot; Vogue&apos;s managing director admonished the young photographer, &quot;you will be representing Vogue, so please do not wear your leather jacket in the St Regis&quot; - advice Bailey pointedly ignored. As the plane took off, Shrimpton was clad, she confessed later, in &quot;the most peculiar leather gear&quot;: a black leather trenchcoat, a black leather pinafore dress and pair of enormous, thigh-high boots. Bailey was also encased in black. &quot;He was utterly beautiful - they were both utterly beautiful,&quot; said their worldlier friend, Nicky Haslam, along for the trip. With his dark eyes and unkempt hair, Bailey looked like nothing so much as &quot;Mowgli setting out across the hills&quot; (if Mowgli were to own winkle-pickers and a polo-neck). &quot;They&apos;ll never let us land,&quot; Rendlesham muttered to Haslam. They did, but US customs turned them over, finding some canine worming pills that Shrimpton had left in her handbag. The pair were enthralled by the city, the riotous circus of its streets and the lunatic display of everyday Manhattan life. They ran circles around Rendlesham, whose brief was to show mid-priced British fashion against the city&apos;s sweeping panorama. But Bailey had his own agenda: to bring to fashion photography the spontaneity of street reportage. Instead of the Statue of Liberty and soaring, modernist architecture, he turned inwards and down. He raked his lens over Shrimpton in phone booths on Broadway, in shooting galleries off Times Square and outside the pagoda-fronted restaurants of Chinatown. A lack of professional polish - hair, make-up, assistant - gave the pictures a rawness so far denied him at British Vogue. This compensated for more immediate vagaries: &quot;It was so cold,&quot; Bailey said, &quot;the cameras stuck to your fingers,&quot; adding, &quot;An adventure? Not really. Clare Rendlesham was crying all the time and Jean was very, very cold. Physically shivering and her eyes watering. The clothes were dreadful. I didn&apos;t think Vogue would like what Jean and I were doing. They didn&apos;t like much of what I did anyway. I didn&apos;t care. I just did what I did. But it worked.&quot; Young Idea Goes West, the result of the trip, ran in April 1962. Bailey and Shrimpton&apos;s collaboration, played out on the fashion pages, mirrored a personal relationship now played out everywhere else. The tall home counties girl and the scruffy urban iconoclast captured the popular imagination, catalysts for London&apos;s emerging youth culture. Bailey had become Vogue&apos;s star photographer, displacing those who told him he would fail because &quot;I didn&apos;t have my head in a cloud of pink chiffon&quot;. He now had an enviable shop window, hijacking nearly every issue of Vogue from 1962 to 1966. In November 1965 it threw in the towel and gave over to him an entire issue and, in so doing, turned him into an idea (as well as an adjective). &quot;Here are,&quot; it trumpeted, &quot;the most Bailey girls in the world ...&quot;. It was around this time Bailey asked Vogue&apos;s managing director to move his Humber so he could park his Rolls-Royce. \u00b7 The photographs shown here are taken from NYJSDB62, due to be published by Steidl in May, priced \u00a328.

Despite protests against the match on the grounds of Israel&apos;s treatment of Palestinian footballers, the FA decided that England will go ahead with the fixture. Those protesting against Israel&apos;s inclusion in UEFA, which it joined in 1991, do so because of Israel&apos;s compound failure to act in the manner of a sportsman where its Palestinian neighbours are concerned. Israel has deliberately targeted Palestinian football team members and facilities which resulted in the Palestinian side failing to make any progress in this game. Most recently, in November 2006, the Palestinians failed to play against Singapore in the Asian Cup qualifier due to the singular reason that Israel barred team players from traveling out of Gaza. Earlier in 2006, Israel fired a missile into the densely populated Gaza Strip which destroyed its only football stadium. Such acts of sabotage thwart all efforts made by Palestinians to progress in this sport in their home territories. The world football organisation FIFA granted Palestine a nation status for the purposes of entering the world cup tournament in 1996. Since then, Israel has at every opportunity attempted to prevent the Palestinian football team from fielding its first choice players at the World Cup qualifiers. Israel&apos;s targeting of the Palestinian stadium and the restriction of movement has meant the Palestinian team is forced to have its practice sessions in Egypt. The team manager is faced with the challenge of training players on an ad hoc basis, depending on who can manage to circumnavigate the Israeli checkpoints and travel to Egypt, and is also forced to wait until just before the starting whistle to name his squad based on the players present. Of course it naturally follows that the Palestinian side can therefore never experience the luxury of a home game - or an away game - in the presence of cheering Palestinian crowds. Israel&apos;s deliberate targeting of sports facilities, punitive travel restrictions on Palestinians, general undermining of Palestinian football, and in particular obstructing Palestinians from participating in international tournaments, has to be categorised as racial discrimination. Faced with such concrete facts, there is dismay that despite the FA&apos;s anti-racism campaign, Kick It Out, which has done great work in the UK since its inception in 1993, it has failed to act on the complaints against England playing Israel and has disregarded heavy UN censure against Israel. On March 9, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination composed of 18 independent experts, issued damning observations. The committee strongly criticised Israel and emphasised 25 areas of concern. These included the issue of the right of return for refugees, the illegal wall and Israel&apos;s compliance with the convention concerning the rights of Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel and Palestinians living in the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT). Of the 25 concerns and recommendations, number 16 directly concerns Palestinian sportsmen and women. It states: &quot;Severe restrictions on the freedom of movement in the OPT targeting a particular national or ethnic group, especially through the wall, checkpoints, restricted roads and permit system, have created hardship and have had a highly detrimental impact on the enjoyment of human rights by Palestinians, in particular their rights to freedom of movement, family life, work, education and health.&quot; Although in an ideal world sports should be kept separate from politics, there is a different reality. Nazi Germany used the 1936 Olympics to showcase Hitler and his fascist ideology, which culminated in the Holocaust and the tragic deaths of six million Jews. Since then, sporting events have been used as a means of political protest, with boycott strategies being used against oppressive regimes, as typified by the civil society movement against apartheid South Africa. Ironically, it was Israel&apos;s relationships with apartheid South Africa that led the UN passing resolution 39/72C declaring that &quot;the increasing collaboration by Israel with the racist regime of South Africa, especially in the military and nuclear fields, in defiance of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, is a serious hindrance to international action for the eradication of apartheid ...&quot; It is easy to understand the call for the boycott of Israel in sporting tournaments until such time that it begins to respect the human rights of Palestinians as stipulated within the Geneva Convention."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/mar/18/ethicalholidays.green.escape", "sentences": ["You&apos;ll spend two weeks in New South Wales, taking in the Blue Mountains and the Hunter Valley, before heading back to Sydney on 28 February for the trip home via Western Australia, Singapore, the Maldives, Mauritius and Reunion to South Africa."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-18T16:16:00Z", "title": "50 best no-fly holidays", "tags": ["Ethical holidays", "Green travel", "Travel", "Travel and transport", "Ethical and green living", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"], "article": "Beaches 1.

A relatively mundane start to a trip that is going to take us right around the world over the next 12 months. It&apos;s a huge adventure, made all the more challenging - and hopefully enjoyable - by the fact that we&apos;re doing it all entirely without flying. Like Joan Armatrading, we&apos;re &apos;dropping the pilot&apos;. Our mission is to rediscover the joy of slow travel, to experience the transition of landscape, people, culture and language, to move through the world and not just over and above it. We&apos;ve dumped flying partly because of the carbon emissions it spews into our overheating atmosphere, but also because we believe that flight has taken a lot of the romance and wonder out of travel. It&apos;s true that the sight of a mountain sunrise from a plane window at 30,000ft can be an incredibly beautiful experience, but there is equally something wonderful about peering through a porthole across an expanse of ocean as the horizon rises and falls with the roll of the ship. For us slow travel is all about appreciating the subtleties of the journey, the nuanced changes in the food served, the music played, the quirks of regional dialects and customs and, of course, the ever-changing scenery rolling by. This is what we are seeking and are excited about - the experience of genuine travel, not an abrupt series of disjointed holidays in different parts of the world interspersed by soulless airport departure lounges and hours in the air only to be dumped, disorientated, in a new destination. The very nature of our travel will be less regimented and our expectations of time and timing will have to change. I suspect if the first few hours of the journey are anything to go by, a rather Zen approach to &apos;waiting time&apos; is going to be needed. We got to Portsmouth Harbour at 7.30pm on Monday only to discover our ferry to Spain, The Pride of Bilbao, was delayed by three hours due to &apos;poor weather conditions&apos; - official maritime speak for a queasy crossing. Handed an apologetic note on check-in, which memorably described the voyage as likely to be &apos;uncomfortable at times&apos;, we then waited with our fellow passengers in the terminal. Once aboard and entering the south-western reaches of the Channel, the five-metre swell, whipped up by the storm force 10 winds, kicked in and the rolling peaks and troughs of the waves began to produce the inexorable lurching and lunging of a ship in a heavy sea. Most of those on the vessel seemed to respond to the challenge of staving off seasickness in the traditional way the British cope with all adversity: a pint and a fag. The ferry route through the Bay of Biscay to Bilbao took us through prime European whale and dolphin watching territory, although the tumultuous sea conditions outside made spotting them difficult (maybe, like the rest of us, they were in the bar). Upon arrival in Spain we will collect our InterRail tickets and begin the first major overland part of our trip, which will take us from Bilbao to Singapore via road and rail over the next four or five months.

It&apos;s a novel called The Taqwacores. Though I fear our literary elite may sniff at it and the more conservative Muslims will be offended, it has already gained a cult following in the States and earned some recognition over here in The Sun. In the words of the publisher: &quot;The Taqwacores is to literature what the Sex Pistols were to music.&quot; I have been awaiting the book&apos;s arrival with more than a little interest because I accidentally had a hand in bringing it to Britain ... but perhaps I should start at the beginning. Its author, Michael Muhammad Knight, might be described as the Hunter S Thompson of Islamic literature. An American of Irish-Catholic descent, he converted to Islam at 16 after reading the biography of Malcolm X. At 17, he went off to Pakistan, spent six hours a day studying religion, came into contact with Afghan refugees and almost joined the Chechen fighters. But then he changed his mind, went back to the US, became disillusioned and turned into a punk Muslim. In case you&apos;re wondering what a punk Muslim is or how to become one, I&apos;m not entirely sure either, but in Knight&apos;s case it means being &quot;that guy at a party who just stands in the corner and talks shit about everyone&quot;. That includes raising hell with the Muslim establishment. He claims to have stink-palmed Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens) and other Muslim celebrities, and he wrote a series of reports about the Islamic Society of North America&apos;s conferences (2003, 2004, and 2005) in a style reminiscent of Rolling Stone magazine. In an interview in 2004, he highlighted the similarities between the Muslim community and (you&apos;d never guess) George W Bush: &quot;He&apos;s anti-abortion, anti-gay and stands for everything that makes standard Islam as hard and mean as standard Christianity.&quot; According to one account, Knight took to visiting his local mosque only at night when there was no one else around, and eventually got a key which enabled him to sleep there. It was while dossing in the mosque that he started writing stories and his first book, Where Mullahs Fear to Tread - completed at the age of 19 - gained the distinction of being banned by religious authorities in Singapore. His second book, The Taqwacores, is the story of some punk Muslims in Buffalo, New York, sharing a house together. Their living room serves multiple functions as a prayer room and party venue - and for the purposes of the former, they have knocked a few bricks out of the wall to serve as a qibla. Their life together mixes sex, dope and prayer in roughly equal amounts, plus near-religious devotion to Islamic-punk taqwacore bands - the sort of musicians who forfeit their street cred the moment they start becoming popular. This is the point where fiction turns into fact, because at the time the book was written taqwacore music didn&apos;t really exist. It does now, as a result of the book. The word &quot;taqwacore&quot; is a combination of &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;taqwa&quot; - an Arabic term usually translated as &quot;piety&quot;. Today, the best-known taqwacore band is The Kominas (a Punjabi word meaning &quot;bastards&quot;), and some of their lyrics are here. One of their most controversial songs, Rumi Was a Homo, attacks Siraj Wahhaj, a prominent Brooklyn imam who was accused of homophobia. Although The Taqwacores is now studied in courses at several American universities, it took some time for the book to be formally published. Initially, Knight made photocopies of it at his local Kinko&apos;s store and distributed them himself in the car parks of mosques. Eventually, the book went on sale by mail order through Alternative Tentacles, a record label in California which trades under the provocative slogan: &quot;Keeping the Homeland insecure since 1979&quot;. I came across the book one day while browsing the internet, found an extract here, and ordered a copy. When it arrived ... well, I have never read anything quite like it, before or since. Early last year, I was chatting to a friend in London who works in publishing and told her about The Taqwacores. &quot;Mmm ... sounds interesting,&quot; she said, and promised to read it. The next thing I heard, one of their staff had gone off to the States, tracked down Knight and signed up the British rights. So now, it&apos;s here. I&apos;m a bit apprehensive but I hope British Muslim organisations will be sensible about it and think twice before protesting. They complain - rightly - about being stereotyped in the media, and The Taqwacores is a powerful antidote to that (which is one good reason why it should be read and circulated as widely as possible). The book is an easy, funny read but, at another level and without labouring the point, it&apos;s also profoundly challenging. It addresses - in a way that&apos;s shocking but ultimately positive - questions of identity that are faced, to some extent, by all young Muslims growing up in the west. Of course, there will be people who insist that the characters in the book are not &quot;true&quot; Muslims. I&apos;m guessing, but I think this is the main point Knight wanted to raise. How do you define a &quot;true&quot; Muslim? On what grounds? And does anyone have the right to judge?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/mar/20/britishairways.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["David Learmount, of Flight International magazine, says: &quot;The airlines give discretion to their captain and crew.&quot; The overhead bins could be used and a couple of years ago it was reported that Singapore Airlines, which operates the longest long-haul flight in the world (17 hours, Singapore to LA), had installed a special cupboard on its A340-500s."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-20T00:19:31Z", "title": "The question: What happens if you die on a plane?", "tags": ["British Airways", "Airline industry"], "article": "Assuming you are not recreating a scene from Agatha Christie&apos;s Death in the Clouds, involving a poison dart and Hercule Poirot, you will probably have died from natural causes.

Unsurprisingly, the benefits of students providing information about their parents&apos; backgrounds to Ucas when applying to higher education have been lost in the predictable accusations of social engineering (Would-be students to be quizzed on parents, March 16). The value of providing admissions tutors with information on whether a candidate&apos;s parents attended university is clear from the initial findings of the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu) Futuretrack survey, which demonstrates that such knowledge can provide deeper insight into students&apos; motivations and enable admissions tutors to select the best candidates. For example, of those students whose parents had not attended university, 85% cited encouragement by careers advisers as a reason to attend, compared to just 15% of applicants whose parents went to university. Other key drivers for students with non-graduate parents included encouragement from teachers; they thought it better than being unemployed; they wanted to realise their potential; they believed it would get them a better job or it was part of their long-term career plans. The additional information will enable university admissions tutors to look beyond simplistic class labels and see that those applying from non-traditional backgrounds have generally made a carefully considered decision based on sound advice and solid careers aspirations. This move by Ucas will positively encourage widening participation and should be applauded.Mike HillChief executive, Hecsu Two generations back, members of our family were servants. Another side of the family fled the poverty and famine of Ireland for terraces in Bolton. In the subsequent generation, my parents both volunteered for the forces in 1939. Now I have a doctorate, all degrees having been achieved while working, and my son attended university. The ways to develop equal opportunities in higher education are through high-quality secondary schools in every town, development of the NHS and welfare state, and the return to grants for those who need them. In other words, an agenda that a postwar Labour government might have recognised.Dr Mic CarolanWigan Isn&apos;t it about time all students applying to universities were judged purely on their academic performance rather than on their social backgrounds? The child of university-educated toffs deserves to get into university no more or no less than the child of working-class Glaswegians. Equally, the latter deserves no more favouritism than the former. In a world of equal opportunity how can we justify depriving someone of a university place because of his or her background?Jonathan CockburnLydney, Gloucestershire University admission is concerned with predicting future performance and not with rewarding past performance. It has been known for some time that, grade for grade at A-level, students from state schools on average perform better three years later than students from private schools. To this is now added the finding that certain sociological factors have a similar effect. Hence &quot;levelling the playing field&quot;, so that all applicants have the same chance of a good degree three years later, is sound policy; to do otherwise unjustifiably advantages the advantaged.Lewis EltonEmeritus professor of higher education, University College London I have been following with some interest the debates about the idea of including more information about parents on university application forms. One of the features of this debate is the suggestion that young people have problems getting themselves admitted to universities. Would that it were so. Some of us who work in universities divide them up not into Russell Group v the rest, but &quot;admitting&quot; universities as contrasted with &quot;recruiting&quot; ones. The need to recruit to keep student numbers up has already resulted in the &quot;admission&quot; of a large number of students who often do not seem to know why they are there. Universities are now degree factories, and are run on a market basis, with the obvious consequences. If the government, or indeed anybody else, is really serious about universities, then it is time they reassessed just exactly what is going on in and around those institutions. Old-style graduates often have quite a shock when they visit them, as did I when I started working in one.Name and address supplied  One reason that fewer working-class students are opting for university is the mountain of debt with which they are now likely to be saddled. This new Ucas proposal is a fine example of &quot;papering over the cracks&quot;. It is manifestly unfair, anti-meritocratic and inegalitarian. Why should a child be penalised because his or her parents - perhaps from a poor working-class background themselves - went to university?Sue SaxbyWrexham I was 14 in communist Hungary when I wasn&apos;t allowed to continue my further education because my parents were middle class. I never doubted that history repeats itself, but who would have thought that it would do so here and within a generation?Kate ColleranLondon The proposal that applicants to university should be asked if their parents went to university as a way of flattening out the social composition left me somewhat bewildered and amused.

Its total annual income is about 265m. Next week in a keynote speech marking his six months at the helm of the agency Mapp will outline his vision at a conference on the future of community sport. Although he was criticised as a &quot;Labour crony&quot; when he was appointed, he will make little effort to hide his dismay and frustration at the 8% budget cut, which will result in 186,000 fewer people being given the chance to participate in sport. The salami-slicing of Sport England&apos;s budget has been dramatic. When London triumphed in Singapore in 2005, the agency was to contribute \u00a3295m of its lottery funding. By last November an extra \u00a344m had been thrown into the pot, and then last week a further \u00a355m. But Mapp will tell conference delegates the impact is even worse because, for every \u00a31 that Sport England invests at the moment, about \u00a33 is levered in from local authorities and private investors. &quot;What that really means is that \u00a31.6bn is not going to community sport,&quot; he says. &quot;That would buy the same number of coaches that there are in the whole of France.&quot; Two days before Jowell&apos;s announcement in the Commons she took Mapp through the budget. &quot;She said she had no option to bridge the gap other than by a significant take on the lottery,&quot; he says. &quot;The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has the smallest budget in government but this is the biggest infrastructure project anywhere. You cannot help being cynical - \u00a31.8bn on regeneration of a polluted site in east London, \u00a31bn on tax, excuse me, so the chancellor gives money to pay himself back. You have got to question some of those things.&quot; Mapp aims to increase participation in sport by two million people by 2012, getting people to engage in - and progressively increase - a minimum of 30 minutes&apos; sport once a week to two or three times. He accuses the government of failing to produce joined-up thinking or act &quot;holistically&quot;. The \u00a355m cut in his budget would represent merely a &quot;rounding up&quot; in the budget of a primary care trust, and the Treasury loses about \u00a38.2bn a year because of Britain&apos;s obesity timebomb. &quot;We need to stop looking at sport for sport&apos;s sake,&quot; Mapp says. &quot;Those who participate regularly in sport are healthier, there is less crime in the streets, there is less obesity, it creates better business leaders. The benefits of participation are rather more than finding another champion for the 400m. It is not just about getting a six-pack.&quot; He says the latest cut will mean his target will automatically be cut by 186,000 people, based on the calculation that coaching and facilities to create an active lifestyle cost \u00a3300 per person. Such a drop is the equivalent of wiping out the regional ambition to increase participation among 185,000 people in Yorkshire and Humberside, or 188,000 in the south-west. Even before last week&apos;s announcement Mapp&apos;s participation target was a tough one. It involved stopping the drop off at the age of 16. &quot;Club nights become nightclubs when teenagers find a night in Yates is better than turning up to play football on Saturday mornings,&quot; he explains. The former chairman of the East Midlands Development Agency believes Sport England is emerging from a period of upheaval, in which 250 jobs have gone in the past three years. Its Active Britain survey has given it the statistical firepower to measure, down to local postcode levels, its success in driving up participation, and Jennie Price, its new chief executive, joins next month. Mapp says: &quot;We will be a formidable partnership and drive through the process of change.&quot; His views will be unpalatable at the DCMS, where his friend of more than 20 years, Richard Caborn, the sports minister, insists grassroots sport investment has never been greater. Mapp disagrees but says there is mutual respect. The &quot;Labour crony&quot; jibes, which he says arose from his donation of a \u00a33,000 printer to his local party, are disappearing amid his outspoken passion for his new job. He admits he is an unlikely champion for sport. He was overweight, a type two diabetic who ate at McDonald&apos;s and never concentrated on his physical fitness. Now, with a small gym at home, he has shed 2\u00bd stone and seems to be relishing his barefoot challenge."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/22/a21stcenturymuslimmodel", "sentences": ["&quot;People say I have two of the most important government portfolios: climate change and terrorism,&quot; joked Dr Yaacob Ibrahim to me on my visit to Singapore last week.", "Dr Ibrahim is Singapore&apos;s dynamic yet down-to-earth minister for the environment and water resources and minister for Muslim affairs.", "He epitomises the meeting of the religious and the worldy in Singapore.", "Singapore - a country that has transformed itself from a third world to a first world country within 40 years - has levels of inter-racial and inter-religious harmony that other nations would die for.", "Around 16% of Singapore&apos;s four million population is Muslim, mainly of Malay origin.", "It has an official Muslim body - the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura or Muis).", "Its overriding priority is to forge a Singaporean Muslim identity as being a &quot;Muslim community of excellence that is religiously profound and socially progressive, which thrives in a multi-religious society, secular state and globalised world&quot;.", "It sees its mission to both deepen Singaporean Muslims&apos; &quot;understanding and practice of Islam&quot; with &quot;enhancing the wellbeing of the nation&quot;.", "Singapore is a tiny country (more a city-state) that is dependent on the US for its security against regional bulwarks.", "Hence anti-US feelings need to be measured with Singapore&apos;s national interest.", "The religious diversity of Singapore, together with rising Islamic revivalism, makes the management of religions important for the Singapore government.", "The Singaporean model is a microcosm of the challenges of managing multi-religious communities in the 21st century, where the secular parameters safeguard the wider interests of people and thus allow each to practise their own religion freely - without any one becoming too assertive.", "Singapore - with its greater state control - has the ability to manage this more &quot;efficiently&quot; than freer countries such as Britain.", "An area where British Muslims excel is their ability to get up and make things happen, hence the City Circle and Muslim Youth Helpline were invited to share their experiences with Singaporean Muslim youth.", "Singaporeans have more of a tendency to wait to be told what to do.", "However, whatever Singaporeans do, they do well.", "One of the older mosques is Singapore&apos;s Ba&apos;alwi mosque, established by Arab migrants from Yemen who trace their lineage back to the Prophet.", "There is much we can learn from the Singaporean model.", "Representatives from Singapore will hopefully be invited to the UK soon to share their experiences."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-22T08:00:32Z", "title": "A 21st century Muslim model", "tags": ["Islam", "World news"], "article": "&quot;People say I have two of the most important government portfolios: climate change and terrorism,&quot; joked Dr Yaacob Ibrahim to me on my visit to Singapore last week. Dr Ibrahim is Singapore&apos;s dynamic yet down-to-earth minister for the environment and water resources and minister for Muslim affairs. He epitomises the meeting of the religious and the worldy in Singapore. Singapore - a country that has transformed itself from a third world to a first world country within 40 years - has levels of inter-racial and inter-religious harmony that other nations would die for. Around 16% of Singapore&apos;s four million population is Muslim, mainly of Malay origin. It has an official Muslim body - the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura or Muis). Established by an act of parliament, Muis restricts itself to dealing with Muslim-specific concerns such as managing mosques, certifying halal meat, collecting religious alms (zakat) and running Islamic scholarship programmes. Its overriding priority is to forge a Singaporean Muslim identity as being a &quot;Muslim community of excellence that is religiously profound and socially progressive, which thrives in a multi-religious society, secular state and globalised world&quot;. It sees its mission to both deepen Singaporean Muslims&apos; &quot;understanding and practice of Islam&quot; with &quot;enhancing the wellbeing of the nation&quot;. A constant theme of its work is to develop the Muslim community in partnership with that of the nation. &quot;Good Muslims are good citizens,&quot; is one of its main mantras and it strives for an Islam which is practised &quot;beyond form or rituals&quot; and &quot;rides the modernisation wave&quot;. Singapore is a tiny country (more a city-state) that is dependent on the US for its security against regional bulwarks. Hence anti-US feelings need to be measured with Singapore&apos;s national interest. Demonstrations against US foreign policy are permitted but in a strictly peaceful and controlled manner. The religious diversity of Singapore, together with rising Islamic revivalism, makes the management of religions important for the Singapore government. Being a secular state, all religions are considered equal. This works to everyone&apos;s advantage. However, rising religious assertiveness within one religious community tilts the harmonious balance and can trigger excesses in other faith groups. As the world becomes increasingly smaller, increasing religiosity needs to be balanced with the interests of others. A secular democratic system attempts to create a balanced situation where there is equal access to the public space while the state remains neutral. (Though there is more than one model of secularism). Many of the religious scholars trained by Muis are graduates of Egypt&apos;s Al Azhar university, considered by most Sunni Muslims to be the most prestigious school of Islamic learning. However, Muis offers before and after training to ensure its young imams have a profound understanding of what it means to be a minority in a multi-faith secular state. The Singaporean model is a microcosm of the challenges of managing multi-religious communities in the 21st century, where the secular parameters safeguard the wider interests of people and thus allow each to practise their own religion freely - without any one becoming too assertive. Singapore - with its greater state control - has the ability to manage this more &quot;efficiently&quot; than freer countries such as Britain. The disadvantage is that, unlike Britain, there is less open debate over these issues. An area where British Muslims excel is their ability to get up and make things happen, hence the City Circle and Muslim Youth Helpline were invited to share their experiences with Singaporean Muslim youth. Singaporeans have more of a tendency to wait to be told what to do. Thinking outside the box and proactively empowering themselves to change their own conditions does not come too readily. However, whatever Singaporeans do, they do well. They are striving to become a major player in Islamic finance, giving London a run for its money. Their interfaith work too is impressive. And given that neighbourhoods are forcibly mixed, they need to be. One of the older mosques is Singapore&apos;s Ba&apos;alwi mosque, established by Arab migrants from Yemen who trace their lineage back to the Prophet. The imam of the mosque is renowned for his inter-faith work. I performed my Friday prayers there and afterwards was invited to a birthday party for a veteran Sikh inter-faith activist - with cake cutting and all. Having good relations with neighbours doesn&apos;t just help with the street parking at congregational prayer times in racially and religiously mixed neighbourhoods, but builds &quot;social goodwill&quot; that can be drawn upon in times of need. A number of supporters of Jemaah Islamiyah - an &quot;affiliate&quot; of Al Qaida - have been recently arrested. Muis provides counselling to those arrested and their families to ween them off the ideology of hate. There is much we can learn from the Singaporean model. Notably their debates on how Islam and secularism can go hand in hand. Representatives from Singapore will hopefully be invited to the UK soon to share their experiences."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/22/zimbabwe.leadersandreply", "sentences": ["Somehow, they miss the point that Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea were also colonies but are now peaceful and booming economically."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-22T23:53:41Z", "title": "Letter: Colonialism and crisis in Zimbabwe", "tags": ["Zimbabwe", "World news", "African Union", "Africa"], "article": "What more do we need to witness before the African Union or the UN tell the Zimbabwean government &quot;enough is enough&quot; (South Africa under fire for failure to act in Mugabe crisis, March 21)? Recently we have seen some devastating atrocities, including the beating of the leader of the opposition, the killing of a political activist and then his body being snatched to prevent a public funeral. International condemnation has freely flowed, but little action has followed. Although the African Union has called for human rights &quot;to be respected&quot; in Zimbabwe, this is far too weak a response. Accountability for human rights violations is central to the African Union&apos;s own Constitutive Act, and that body needs to show that it has the political will to hold the government of Zimbabwe to account for these atrocities. Otherwise, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the AU after all may not be entirely different from the defunct, state-centred Organisation of African Unity.Kolawole Olaniyan  Programme director, Amnesty International Africa The events in Zimbabwe are only the latest in a series of tragedies that have dogged African peoples in Uganda, Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the DRC, Sudan and the Ivory Coast since independence. In that time, they have been ruled by their presidents, who double as the supreme institution, controlling the army, police, parliament, the judiciary, state intelligence organisations and the civil service. Without independent state institutions, not even the Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai will ever establish sustainable good governance, the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental human rights. A classic example is Uganda where Lieutenant General Museveni came to power in 1986, promising that his revolution was a fundamental change. But 21 years on, Uganda has made 180-degree turn. In the past two years, Museveni has amended the constitution, virtually making him a life president; arrested his most credible opponent Dr Kizza Besigye three months before the elections; and conducted the first multi-party elections in 26 years under one-party rule. Sadly, British, Commonwealth and other world leaders have been deafly silent about the deteriorating situation in Uganda. Instead, they have decided to reward Museveni holding the 2007 Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Uganda this November. Museveni, like Mugabe and most African leaders, have blamed British colonialism for their failures. Somehow, they miss the point that Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea were also colonies but are now peaceful and booming economically. The only difference is that the latter have independent state institutions while the former do not.Sam Akaki Uganda Forum for Democratic Change What tends to be forgotten is that Robert Mugabe is not solely responsible for the precarious state in which Zimbabwe finds itself. The seeds of the present debacle were sown more than a quarter of a century ago, at the pre-independence 1979 Lancaster House agreement. Prominent in that agreement is the fact that 20 parliamentary seats were to be automatically reserved for the minority white settler community. Second, the agreement stipulated that no land reform issues were allowed to be discussed for the following 10 years. This meant that, from the very beginning, the authority of the new government was undermined. There was a barely disguised demonisation campaign by the white settlers - remnants of and supporters of the white separatist Ian Smith regime - of Mugabe and all he stood for. Those critics nostalgically harking back to the halcyon days of &quot;benign white rule&quot; ought to remember that elementary freedom was regained at independence. There are scores of countries with bad or worse governments than that of Zimbabwe. We hardly hear anything about these, as compared to the flood of news stories from Zimbabwe. What is at work here is a singling out of Mugabe.GG Carmen-Benskin Manchester"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2007/mar/23/afterthesmokeclears", "sentences": ["Elsewhere in the international academic world, campus-wide bans have been enacted or are in process at some institutions in Singapore, Canada and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T10:47:10Z", "title": "After the smoke clears", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education"], "article": "In the healthy tradition of Canada, Ireland, and a growing number of American cities, most Britons are now counting down the weeks until their workplaces and restaurants become smoke-free. But how long will it be until universities take a tobacco leaf from their international counterparts&apos; policy books and follow suit with campus-wide smoking bans? In the United States, at least 40 institutions of higher learning have recently gone smoke-free, according to an organisation calling itself Americans for Nonsmokers&apos; Rights. The organisation has also published a helpful primer for other campuses wishing to follow suit. It proposes banning smoking within private student accommodation and removing cigarettes from campus shops.  In a country with more than 4,000 degree-granting institutions, a total of 40 bans is relatively microscopic, of course, but then so was the number of jurisdictions flirting with similar policies only a decade ago. Elsewhere in the international academic world, campus-wide bans have been enacted or are in process at some institutions in Singapore, Canada and Australia.  Fiji&apos;s flagship University of the South Pacific, whose last vice-chancellor died of lung cancer, has also shunted its puffing students out behind the bike shed. And the University of Newcastle banned smoking throughout from the beginning of the year. But not every academic observer is buying into the smokefree air of good feeling. Responding to a rant by the blogger Fibrodenial, one online contributor from an unnamed liberal arts college asks how long it might be until campuses start setting aside designated areas for fat people, ugly people, people with braces, and even a section for single women with more than one cat. Still, things could be worse. Today in some parts of the United States, even death row inmates are sometimes denied a cigarette ahead of their scheduled deaths, in the interests of promoting a smoke-free execution environment. The situation spurred Canadian scholar Justin E. H. Smith, a philosophy lecturer at Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, and contributor to the dependably hard-hitting Counterpunch.org, to write:  I hate capital punishment. It&apos;s revolting, and I&apos;m kept awake at night knowing that it&apos;s going on. But I hate so much more the knowledge that a condemned man is denied his right to smoke, in order that his executioners may pretend that what is taking place is a normal part of the smooth and sterile procedure-following of a healthy and modern institution. If it&apos;s going to happen, blood needs to splatter, the heavens might do their part by trembling a bit, and all those complicit deserve at least a bit of second-hand smoke in their eyes.  Even the most anti-smoking academic type, enthused by anti-smoking measures abroad but possessed of a working social conscience, would surely cough loudly in agreement."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/mar/23/business.shanghai.asia", "sentences": ["Flights: 10Miles flown: 29,797Destinations: Tokyo, London, Munich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, DusseldorfNights in a hotel: 12Nights on a dancefloor: 5Satisfaction rating: 9.81/10 How time flies."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-23T10:56:16Z", "title": "Business traveller's diary: March 4-17", "tags": ["Travel", "Business travel", "Shanghai holidays", "Asia"], "article": "Flights: 10Miles flown: 29,797Destinations: Tokyo, London, Munich, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Singapore, DusseldorfNights in a hotel: 12Nights on a dancefloor: 5Satisfaction rating: 9.81/10 How time flies. It only feels like yesterday that I scripted my first dispatch on flight BA961 to the world&apos;s busiest international airport, London Heathrow. Some 93,128 flying miles and innumerable BA hot chocolates later, I have the joy of writing to you for a fifth time.  To continue the prevailing sense of self-satisfaction, it&apos;s been a delight to be back in Asia over the last fortnight. Nothing can provide the cultural, roller-coaster ride of a fortnight on the earth&apos;s largest continent. Granted it&apos;s hard. The jet lag is violent (I once ironed my head as well as a shirt on my arrival in Beijing) and the simplest exercise appears to be riddled with difficulty. Any business traveller who has tried to reach their destination in a barely functioning Chinese taxi will recognise the sentiment (and accompanying rage). We may have disparaging views of Chirac and Bush, but we understand France and America. We recognise their culture, their people and, broadly at least, their ways of working. But much of Asia remains a touch bewildering. And so naturally we simplify. Either we think, &quot;all of Asia is the same&quot;. Or we are over-influenced by vastly exaggerated film or literature which suggest India is full of ineffectual, head-wobbling dancers clad in pink and Japan is a land where business is conducted by alcoholics in sleeping pods.  What I&apos;m trying to say (and whisper it softly) is that I&apos;m convinced that our predecessors&apos; picture of Asia as a frantic land full of deferential, comically short men grappling meekly with poverty, dictatorship and corporate inactivity hasn&apos;t completely been eradicated.  What a crying shame this is. Firstly, most Asians are significantly taller than Jimmy Krankie. More significantly perhaps, the people you&apos;ll meet are booming and confident, with a dynamism often missing within our tired manufacturing sector in Europe. The zeal for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial growth among the Chinese and Indians in particular is thrilling for any tired European business person.  And they live in countries that are increasingly sophisticated and yet still authentic, that fuse the best of their historic cultures with the modernity of the west. As a roving businessmen, you can stay in magnificent, state-of-the-art hotels but spend the evening munching delicious masala dosas on banana leaves; or you can stay in a ryokan blessed by Japanese samurai but spend the evening listening to English funky house in a super-hip night spot. Cultural exploration plus reassuring familiarity: it&apos;s a winner. And let me not give you the impression that &quot;all of Asia is the same&quot;. A month spent working in various parts of Asia can provide unparalleled variety. A week in Mumbai will exhaust you, but provide unforgettable memories of colourful bustle, ceaseless energy, boundless intelligence and genuine warmth. A week in Shanghai (especially if you were there 10 years ago) will leave you a little disorientated but amazed by the rapidity of China&apos;s progress and its zealous embrace of Western life. And a week spent in Japan will leave you lusting for more: a better understanding of its dedication to aesthetic beauty and the singular traditions of its people.  So this week I have one, rather simple tip for you. Go to Asia: just as quickly as BA or Virgin can take you. Before I leave you, however, a quick note on a completely different topic: the highly contentious open skies agreement. For those of you who don&apos;t know, currently only BA, Virgin, AA and United are allowed to fly from Heathrow to the US; but now the open-skies agreement has been ratified by the EU, a wide series of airlines (Delta, Lufthansa, etc) will be allowed to pull the same highly lucrative trick. As a deep lover of BA and Virgin, with an avid interest in their profit margins, my first instinct was one of rage. But on reflection, this could be a highly beneficial development for the business traveller.  First, the agreement will also open up other European airports. So BA could fly Frankfurt to JFK or Paris to LA if they wished; and allow you to fly your favourite airline over the Atlantic without returning to London. And second, if we Brits negotiate successfully, BA might also be able to fly internally within the US, ie New York to San Francisco or Washington to LA. Imagine the joy of that. We business travellers crave choice and the whole open skies caboodle might just give us a lot more. Exciting times ahead. That&apos;s it for now. Good night and good luck.

They know that if you see another swede, you&apos;ll scream - quite possibly at them as you cancel your order. But they have a cunning plan, to bamboozle you, amuse you and generally distract you from the all too familiar pile of roots and kale. This week they&apos;re sending you ... a coconut! &quot;Wow, Mum, it&apos;s a coconut!&quot; The whole family gathers round and has a go at feeling it and shaking it. A pleasing sloshing sound indicates that it&apos;s a good, fresh specimen, full of coconut water, full of potential. But there is a danger at this point that the coconut will be taken out of the control of the resident cook and co-opted into the service of other members of the family, either as a handy projectile or to be customised into the new family pet. Don&apos;t let it happen. Remember, it&apos;s there to compensate for those tedious roots and brassicas. Or perhaps, and here&apos;s where it gets exciting, to help you transform them into something delightful and exotic. But first you have to open it. And even before that, you want to tap that lovely coconut water. The best way to do this is to locate that little trio of dark spots at one end of the coconut - they are slightly softer than the rest of the shell - and pierce two of them. You can do this with a short Phillips screwdriver, tapped sharply with a hammer, or by grinding away with the point of a corkscrew. Or you could get out your Black &amp; Decker ... Pour the water into a bowl or large glass. Of course, you&apos;ll want to crack the nut itself into two neat halves - ostensibly to give the kids something to play with, but in reality so you can amuse your friends with your hilarious impression of King Arthur in Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Either way, I&apos;ll indulge you. Take your biggest, heaviest chopping board and put it on a solid table, or even the floor. Lay the coconut on the board. Take your biggest, heaviest chopping knife, or a cleaver. Locate a hammer or small mallet. Align the blade of the knife/cleaver across the middle of the coconut and tap hard with the hammer. Very satisfying! To remove the flesh, cut thick slices through it to the inside of the shell, then cut across them to make cubes. Then use the tip of a flexible knife to pop them out. From a good, wet coconut, I love eating some of the flesh au naturel: fresh, raw and unseasoned. But it&apos;s a wonderful ingredient, too, so don&apos;t scoff it all. Maybe you&apos;ll want to call the box scheme guys after all - to see if next week they can send you two coconuts. Coconut sambal A sambal is a chilli-hot relish found in the cooking of Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, and served in small amounts alongside other dishes. This is a very simple, very delicious, very refreshing example. It&apos;s essential to cut everything finely, so take your time. This one makes a great accompaniment to veg curry, but is also delicious with grilled fish or even roast chicken or lamb. Serves four. 100g fresh coconut 60g baby spinach leaves, young kale or spring greens, washed and coarse stalks removed \u00bd-1 fresh hot red chilli, deseeded, finely chopped Lemon or lime juice Salt and pepper Grate the coconut on a medium grater. Roll the spinach into tight, cigar-like wads and slice into very fine ribbons. Combine the coconut, spinach and chilli with a good squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and pepper. Leave for about 15 minutes for the flavours to mingle, then toss again. Coconut and root vegetable curry This enticing combination of the exotic and the familiar can be served as a chunky curry or a smooth soup. Make sure you include potato in the vegetable mix, and two or three other roots: parsnip, swede, celeriac and/or carrot. If you don&apos;t want to roast and grind the spices, use a couple of heaped teaspoons of a trusted brand of curry powder. If you do this, you might need to add more heat in the form of a pinch of cayenne pepper or dried chilli flakes. Serves four. &apos;Milk&apos; from 1 coconut (see recipe) or 400ml tinned organic coconut milk 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp coriander seeds 1 dried hot red chilli, crumbled 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 large garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped 1kg root vegetables (see above), peeled and cut into chunky dice Salt and freshly ground pepper Lemon or lime juice 2 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped To extract the &apos;milk&apos; from a coconut, grate the flesh as finely as possible, pile it into a clean tea towel, squeeze out as much juice as possible, then mix with the coconut water you saved earlier. It is now &apos;stock&apos; for the curry. Put the cumin, coriander and chilli in a dry frying pan over a medium heat and toast, tossing occasionally, until really fragrant. Grind to a powder in a coffee grinder, or pestle and mortar, and combine with the turmeric. Heat the oil in a large pan over a medium heat, add the onion and garlic, and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and golden. Add the spices (or two teaspoons of curry powder), stir and cook for a minute or two, then stir in the root veg to coat in the spicy mixture. Add the coconut milk, bring to a gentle simmer, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender. If it&apos;s a bit thin, remove a couple of tablespoons of veg, mash them and stir back in to thicken the sauce. Season with salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lemon or lime juice, then serve in shallow dishes, with rice, scattered with the coriander. To serve as a creamy soup, add 400ml vegetable or light chicken stock with the coconut milk. When the vegetables are tender, pur\u00e9e until smooth. Coconut and carrot cake Sometimes I am able to kid myself that this is actually a form of health food. After all, it does contain carrots, nuts and lime juice. Those with clearer vision should still be able to enjoy it for the scrumptious treat that it is. Serves 12. 225g unsalted butter, softened 225g caster sugar 4 eggs, separated Juice and finely grated zest of 1 lime 175g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder 50g ground almonds 100g walnuts, roughly chopped  250g carrots, peeled and coarsely grated 100g fresh coconut flesh, finely grated 150g cream cheese 225g icing sugar, sifted Juice and finely grated zest of 1 lime Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease and line a 20cm round cake tin. Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks, then lime zest and juice. Combine the flour, baking powder and almonds, fold them in, then fold in the walnuts, carrot and coconut. Beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks and fold into the mixture. Spoon into the prepared tin and bake for an hour and a quarter to an hour and three-quarters, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then turn out on to a rack to cool completely. While it&apos;s cooling, make the icing by beating together the cream cheese, icing sugar and the juice and zest of the lime. Cut the cooled cake in half through the middle, spread with half the icing, then sandwich back together and top with the rest.  \u00b7 At the River Cottage Summer Nights events, you can wander round the farm and garden before enjoying a feast cooked using the bread oven, barbecue and spit; go to rivercottage.net for details."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/24/cricket.cricketworldcup20076", "sentences": ["Many of these matches were played outside traditional cricket centres, in places like Sharjah, Singapore and Toronto, making them more difficult to monitor."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T23:56:08Z", "title": "Cricket World Cup: Death in Jamaica sees return of the game's darkest sub-plots", "tags": ["Sport", "Cricket", "Cricket world cup 2007", "Jamaica", "Americas"], "article": "The link between the murder of Pakistan&apos;s coach, Bob Woolmer, and match-fixing is for now unproven but it is sure to form a major part of inquiries by both the Jamaican police and the cricketing authorities. For cricket that means a return to some of the darkest and most damaging episodes in the game&apos;s recent past. Match-fixing came to prominence in the 1990s and has never entirely gone away. When the South African cricket administrator Ali Bacher launched his autobiography in Mumbai in 2004 he said the problem was &quot;suppressed, not over&quot; despite the clean-up operation by Lord Condon&apos;s Anti-Corruption Unit. Bacher described the scandal as bigger than the Kerry Packer revolution and the Bodyline series. Allegations of match-fixing have continued and last month the West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels was accused of leaking confidential information to a bookmaker, Mukesh Kochar, before a one-day game against India in Nagpur. Match-fixing does not necessarily relate to the result of the match. It can be about an individual batsman&apos;s score, the number of runs scored from a particular over, or ball, or a bowler&apos;s tally of wickets. The potential for corruption grew with the expanded satellite TV coverage of one-day cricket, especially in Asia, in the 1980s. Many of these matches were played outside traditional cricket centres, in places like Sharjah, Singapore and Toronto, making them more difficult to monitor. There were rumours of match-fixing when India played Pakistan in Calcutta in 1979-80 but only in the 1990s did they come to the fore. Mukesh Kumar Gupta, a former bank clerk and jeweller turned bookmaker, claimed that during Sri Lanka&apos;s 1994 tour of India Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva had agreed to &quot;underperform&quot;. The players denied this. Gupta told Indian federal investigators from the Central Bureau of Investigation that he profited when Sri Lanka lost the first Test. Gupta also claimed he paid Brian Lara $40,000 to underperform in two one-day games and Alec Stewart \u00a35,000 for information; Stewart not only denied this but said he had not knowingly met Gupta. In 1995 three Australians, Shane Warne, Tim May and Mark Waugh, claimed they had been offered \u00a3130,000 by Salim Malik not to play well in the 1994 Karachi Test. Malik was banned for life and it was recommended that Wasim Akram should never captain his country again. Wasim, Waqar Younis, Saeed Anwar and Mushtaq Ahmed were all fined. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, meanwhile, alleged that Asif Iqbal, once of Kent, had been a go-between in match-fixing negotiations. The first cricketer to admit match-fixing in one-day internationals was India&apos;s former captain, Mohammad Azharuddin, who had met Gupta in 1995. After finding Azharuddin unreliable, Gupta told the CBI inquiry that he sought out Hansie Cronje late in 1996. Gupta claimed that in 1996 he had had the pitch at Delhi&apos;s Feroz Shah Kotla ground doctored for the Test between India and Australia, which India won in less than four days. He was told that the first Test against South Africa at Ahmedabad would not be drawn; India won and Gupta profited. Cronje said he accepted money from Gupta but did not throw matches. Gupta&apos;s match-fixing days ended in May 1998. But Cronje was soon making deals with others.The South African gambler Marlon Aronstam contacted South Africa&apos;s captain on his mobile phone on the fourth day of the fifth Test against England at Centurion Park in January 2000. Aronstam told Cronje that he wanted him to &quot;make a game&quot; of the rain-hit match, which was heading for a draw, and paid him 53,000 rand, plus a leather jacket for his wife. Then Cronje met another bookie, Chawla, and discussed deals on his mobile phone. He asked Pieter Strydom, Mark Boucher, Jacques Kallis and Lance Klusener to play badly but they turned him down. Then he negotiated with Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams. But his mobile phone was tapped. The Delhi police released the tapes in 2000 and Cronje was banned for life. Gibbs and Williams were suspended for six months. In 2002 Cronje, the man who cheated cricket, was killed in a plane crash."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries", "sentences": ["He ended his war in Singapore, where he got exclusive film of the surrender of the Japanese forces in September 1945."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-24T23:58:10Z", "title": "Obituary: John Turner", "tags": [], "article": "Just after 4pm, on November 25 1941, a squadron from the Royal Navy&apos;s Mediterranean Fleet, comprising the battleship HMS Barham, together with two of its sister ships, HMS Valiant and HMS Queen Elizabeth, plus 12 destroyers was en route back to Alexandria, Egypt. It was then, at a range of 750 yards, that the German submarine U331 launched four torpedoes. Three holed the warship and set it on fire. On board the Valiant was Gaumont British News cameraman John Turner, who has died aged 91. His wide-angle lens picked up the 643ft 3in of the stricken 33,000-tonne Barham - but all Turner had was two minutes of film. As the ship rolled over and its funnel brushed the water he let his camera run. What Turner captured, the death agony of a great ship, became one of the most celebrated pieces of newsreel shot during the second world war. The Barham&apos;s main magazine blew up and this was followed, as he wrote in his autobiography, Filming History (2001) by the &quot;whole inside, turrets, machinery, pieces of ship flung high into the air. A huge pall of smoke, red glow in the centre, rose above the water, billowing out and mercifully covering the dreadful scene.&quot; As the Valiant moved away there was a click when Turner&apos;s film ran out. The Barham took just two and a half minutes to go down and, of more than 1,200 crew members, more than 860 died. It was, recalled the commander in chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Andrew Cunningham, who was on the Queen Elizabeth, &quot;a horrible and awe-inspiring spectacle&quot;. Turner&apos;s footage was not publicly shown until the end of the conflict. &quot;Your Mr Turner should be aware,&quot; Cunningham told the Valiant&apos;s captain, &quot;that it is not in the interests of the war effort or of the Royal Navy to show our own warships sinking.&quot; There was another reason too. The German navy was unaware that the Barham had sunk until January 1942. So the Admiralty did not announce the loss, which came in the wake of the destruction of the battlecruiser Hood, and just before the mining of the Valiant and the Queen Elizabeth. Turner&apos;s footage stayed impounded until 1945. The authorities meanwhile conceded the loss of the Barham in late January 1942. Bizarrely, the first news of the Barham&apos;s loss had come via a Scottish spiritualist, Helen Duncan, who during a December 1941 seance, claimed to have encountered a dead sailor from the battleship. Three years later, amidst a Fleet Street flurry, she found herself, fantastically, charged and convicted under the 1737 Witchcraft Act. Winston Churchill labelled the proceedings &quot;absolute tomfoolery&quot;. Turner was a newsreel cameraman from the days when the news was an essential part of the cinema programme. From the 1930s to the 1960s, he filmed many of the events whose images have become burned into the general consciousness. Born in Hampstead, the son of a master printer, Turner went to boarding school, leaving to work in a publicity department. He had an uncle in the film industry, and in 1936 joined Gaumont British News as an assistant cameraman. Graduating to cameraman, he filmed many key events in the late 1930s, including the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and the prime minister Neville Chamberlain&apos;s return from the 1938 Munich meeting promising &quot;peace for our time&quot;. With the outbreak of the second world war Turner became a naval war correspondent. It was while filming in the Mediterranean with the vital Malta convoys that he made his fateful film of the Barham. He went on to film the invasion of Sicily in 1943 and D-Day in 1944. He ended his war in Singapore, where he got exclusive film of the surrender of the Japanese forces in September 1945. Turner&apos;s personal blend of determination with discretion, combined with a happy knack of invariably obtaining the right picture, made him the favoured choice of newsreel editors for special assignments. He was sent to India in 1947, accompanying Lord Mountbatten, to film events surrounding the independence celebrations. He was the only British news cameraman in the country when Gandhi was assassinated in January 1948, enduring a night of panic as he found he had no film stock and had to scour Delhi for scraps sufficient for the spectacular funeral the following day. The 1950s saw him assigned to cover royal family stories. His footage would then be shared among each of the newsreels and later the first television news producers, an arrangement from an altogether gentler media age. As the 1950s ended, the cinema newsreels started to fade in the face of the competition from television. Gaumont British News folded in 1959, but Turner remained royal rota cameraman, his final royal tour being Prince Philip&apos;s 1962 visit to South America. He then joined Pathe News, no longer as a cameraman, but eventually as news editor, where he was responsible for organising coverage of Winston Churchill&apos;s funeral in 1965 and the 1966 World Cup. Pathe News folded in 1970 and Turner ran his own film business until retiring in 1981. The determination that characterised his career continued into retirement. Up to the end of last year he was making regular trips from his home in Eastbourne to meet friends in his beloved London. In his autobiography, he wrote: &quot;I have tried to travel with a seeing eye, for what I saw the audience saw.&quot; Not a day goes by without a screen somewhere around the world showing scenes filmed by Turner, whose presence at many of the 20th-century&apos;s major events and whose eye for the lasting image ensures immortality. He married Katherine Susan Fitzroy in 1945. The marriage was dissolved in 1958. His second wife, Daphne Burns-Shearer, predeceased him. \u00b7 Phil John Turner, cameraman, born March 31 1915; died March 7 2007 Watch John Turner&apos;s footage of the sinking of HMS Barham here."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/30/extract.martinwainwright", "sentences": ["The Straits Times in Singapore did, in 1999, with a report that a nerdy local teenager had created a small, cheap computer program that guaranteed to kill off the Year 2000 computer bug that was causing great consternation at the time."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-30T08:52:51Z", "title": "Martin Wainwright on some of the silliest April Fool tricks", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Original writing"], "article": "Buried loot, 1840s At the time in the 1840s when European visitors were denouncing American greed for a fast buck, one of the earliest newspapers April Fools, printed by the Boston Post, proved their point. It electrified the city by announcing that a cavern full of gold, jewels and other loot had been found by workmen digging out the roots of a felled tree on Boston Common. Everyone could go and have a peek at the presumed pirate hoard, or cache left by the dastardly British, on April 1. As an eyewitness recorded: &quot;It was rainy, the Legislature was in session, and it was an animated scene that the Common presented, roofed with umbrellas, sheltering pilgrims on their way. A procession of grave legislators marched solemnly down under their green gingham with philosophers, archaeologists, numismatists, antiquarians of all qualities and the public.&quot; Nothing awaited them except disappointment, the rain-soaked turf of the common and a small hole. And the Boston Post saying, &quot;April Fool&quot;. The spaghetti harvest, 1957 Cameraman Charles De Jaeger and producer David Wheeler &quot;made their pitch to me,&quot; recalls the then Panorama editor Michael Peacock. &quot;April 1 would be on a Monday that year, so this would be a rare opportunity to carry an April Fool. They outlined how the story of the spaghetti harvest would go. Charles, a freelance who&apos;d worked for Panorama from the start, explained that he was going to be filming in Switzerland anyway. He knew a small village where the women would be happy to take part, and he was sure they could attach spaghetti to trees! So it wouldn&apos;t cost much to film. &quot;I couldn&apos;t say no. I gave Charles a budget of \u00a3100, and off he went. He did a splendid job of filming the harvest, but not enough credit has been given to David for the brilliant pastiche newsreel commentary he wrote for Richard Dimbleby.&quot; It was a masterly 350 words (&quot;Many of you, I am sure, will have seen pictures of vast spaghetti plantations in the Po valley. For the Swiss, however, it tends to be more of a family affair . . .&quot;), suited to the sonorous cadences of Dimbleby, who saw the script and fortunately agreed to join the prank. The film ran for three minutes. Millions watched as yet another fascinating &quot;window on the world&quot; (Panorama&apos;s catchphrase) was opened for their information, education and entertainment. Then Dimbleby reappeared and gave them a whopper of a nudge. &quot;Now we say goodnight,&quot; he signed off, &quot;on this first day of April.&quot; Most of the millions watching missed his clue. The spoof had scored an extraordinary bull&apos;s-eye. The BBC did its best to reassure critics - it would be a long time before April Fool&apos;s fell on a Monday again, said officials. They meanwhile took a playful line in following up the hoax. After a few days, anyone who rang up or wrote in about growing their own spaghetti was advised: place a sprig of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best. The Spiggot rebellion, 1973 There are many curious names in England&apos;s West Country, from Piddle Trenthithe to Nempnett Thrubwell via Woolfardisworthy (which tricks visiting tourists because you pronounce it &quot;Woolsery&quot;). So viewers of the region&apos;s independent channel Westward TV in 1973 had few suspicions about Spiggot, a hamlet whose April Fool&apos;s rebellion against the recent introduction of decimal currency was given generous coverage. The programme&apos;s quaint rustics attracted many phone calls and letters of support. Spiggot and its doughty folk were, however, studio inventions, but their supporter in faraway Bradford, who said that if her city went decimal she would shop in Halifax, was genuine. Leap of imagination, 1976 Patrick Moore was an ideal presenter to carry off an astronomical hoax. As weighty as Richard Dimbleby, with an added air of batty enthusiasm that only added to his credibility, he announced on TV on April Fool&apos;s Day 1976 that a &quot;unique astronomical event&quot; was going to occur at 9.47am. As the little planet Pluto passed behind Jupiter, he said, a &quot;gravitational alignment&quot; would reduce the Earth&apos;s gravity for a few moments. Anyone who jumped into the air at 9.47 would experience a strange floating sensation. They did too - or at least hundreds of them thought they did. The BBC was flooded with appreciative calls from people claiming to have floated, including a woman who said that she and 11 friends had been wafted from their chairs and orbited gently around the room. San Serriffe, 1977 &quot;The Financial Times was always doing special reports on little countries I&apos;d never heard of,&quot; says former Guardian advertising rep Philip Davies. &quot;I was thinking about April Fool&apos;s Day 1977 and I thought, why don&apos;t we just make a country up?&quot; Special reports editor Stuart St Clair Legge suggested the title that was to become a legend: San Serriffe, part typographic pun, part credible name for a tropical isle. It also had the special appropriateness for the Guardian of challenging spelling. During its long relationship with San Serriffe, starting with the original supplement itself, the paper has printed the name with carefree inconsistency, using every possible variation of &quot;r&quot;s and &quot;f&quot;s, and, on one occasion, two &quot;e&quot;s. Picking up Legge&apos;s theme, staffer Geoffrey Taylor designed a shrunken semicolon-shaped version of New Zealand&apos;s twin islands and based everything on the rich vocabulary of print. Leading islanders, such as the dictator General Pica, and places like the capital, Bodoni, were named after fonts of type and their measurements: he even got away with a wilderness area on the north island called Wodj of Type. The islands were positioned off the Canaries and with just over three days to go, the final shape of the major, seven-broadsheet-page supplement was drawn up. Then, in the late afternoon of March 27, two jumbo jets collided at Tenerife airport, causing the worst aviation disaster in the world, in which 583 people died. The delicate web of April Fool fantasy suddenly seemed marginal. The editor, Peter Preston, teetered on the edge of pulling San Serriffe, but fortunately it was not abandoned. With a Herculean effort, the islands were relocated in the Indian Ocean, their history, flora and fauna completely revised. So San Serriffe indelibly joined the map of the world. Next morning, the phone calls started early, the letters followed later. Thousands of readers were taken in; spin-offs soon included &quot;I&apos;ve been to San Serriffe&quot; car stickers and a T-shirt from the islands, which sold a record 12,000 to readers. Marathon man, 1981 Heroically lost or misdirected outposts are an April Fool stock-in-trade, like the wartime barrage balloon the Sunday Telegraph claimed to have discovered in Scotland. In 1981, the Daily Mail tracked a Japanese runner who had misunderstood the rules of the London Marathon, held on March 29, and thought he was supposed to run not for 26 miles but 26 days. The man&apos;s name, Kimo Nakajimi, had nice echoes of being knackered and gyms and readers were asked to look out for him on suburban roads or in the Home Counties. Sightings were included, along with an admission from a marathon organiser, Timothy Bryant, who confessed that his Japanese was dodgy and that Kimo might also have been confused because of &quot;the very long races they have over there&quot;. Chunnel trouble, 1990 If you&apos;re spoofing the building of a tunnel there&apos;s one enticing joke to play, and the News of the World went for it in 1990. The paper reported that the Channel tunnel project, at long last under way after centuries of discussion, had run into yet another glitch, and a really bad one. Costs had already spiralled and labour troubles had added to engineering challenges to slow things down. Now, guess what, surveyors had realised that the two halves being built simultaneously from Britain and France would miss one another by 14ft. The \u00a310bn error - previously used as an April Fool on tunnels in the Alps, America and Japan - was blamed in proper tabloid style on French engineers who had insisted on using the metric system. The Brits had stuck loyally to miles and inches. Other Chunnel spoofs over the long years of construction (1987-94) included a more original suggestion, in the Sunday Express, that work had stopped after the discovery of a gold seam at exactly halfway, which was being claimed by both Britain and France. Motorway madness, 1991 It had the virtue of simplicity: in 1991, the Times revealed that the relatively new but already choked London orbital motorway the M25 was to follow an alternating one-way system. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, all six lanes in both directions would be used clockwise. On Tuesdays and Thursdays everyone would go the other way. The idea was given credibility by the usual assortment of technical details, plus the fact that things would revert to normal at weekends. Hoax protesters were soon joined by real ones as readers rang or wrote in. One suspect commuter from Swanley in Kent complained: &quot;Villagers use the motorway to make shopping trips to Orpington. On some days this will be a journey of two miles, and on others a journey of 117 miles. The scheme is lunatic.&quot; Congestion has since become so severe on the M25 that the apparently mad scheme may now seem like a bright idea. Moscow underground, 1992 As the former Soviet Union thawed, its sense of humour warmed up. In 1992, the Moskovskaya Pravda newspaper guyed the country&apos;s increasingly passionate embrace of capitalism with news that the city was going to build a second underground system. The Moscow underground, built by Stalin to impress the rest of the world, is a genuine wonder, with marble floors, classical pillars and even chandeliers, but it does get crowded. The newspaper explained, however, that the new system was not intended to relieve the crush. It was ideologically necessary under capitalism to have at least two of everything, &quot;to destroy monopolies in the interests of competition&quot;. Pravda is Russian for &quot;truth&quot;, which this was not. Millennium bug, 1999 How could anyone get away with a new invention-based company called Polo Flair? The Straits Times in Singapore did, in 1999, with a report that a nerdy local teenager had created a small, cheap computer program that guaranteed to kill off the Year 2000 computer bug that was causing great consternation at the time. All the big players in the online world were wrestling with the problem - the possibility that computer clocks would fail to understand the concept of a new millennium and would reset everything, plunging all computer-controlled systems into chaos. And now this Chinese lad had sorted out a solution in less than half an hour while doing his algebra homework. His family were supposed to be looking for financial partners and talking about annual takings of \u00a340m, but the boy proved terminally elusive. It was, after all, April 1, as other news media and would-be investors gradually sussed. Fishy story, 2000 Campaigning groups and ethical good causes have latched on, too. An imaginative example was the &quot;tournament of sleeping fish&quot; announced in the US. This was the brainchild of the campaigning group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), a serious outfit that no one ever suspected of having an urge to play practical jokes. But in 2000 they did just that, showing an appealing sense of humour and getting precious publicity by sabotaging the annual fishing tournament in Lake Palestine, Texas. Organisers were told that the lake would be massively dosed with tranquillisers, which meant that nothing would bite. &quot;The fish will be napping, not nibbling,&quot; said Peta, as wildlife rangers and chemists were dispatched by alarmed authorities. The Feds should have done their maths. To make the trick work, the 25,500-acre reservoir would have needed more sleeping tablets than could be carried by three large sea-going oil tankers. Raise the Titanic, 2001 It was a sight too good to miss. So a blustery April Fool&apos;s Day in 2001 saw a crowd of several hundred gather in the wind and rain on Beachy Head to watch a full-size replica of the Titanic steam past. In spite of foot-and-mouth restrictions on much of the surrounding land, enthusiasts from up to 40 miles away managed to get to the grassy slopes above the famous lighthouse. They were responding to a bulletin on Southern FM radio. Alas, they had failed to note a string of giveaways, including the fact that the replica had been built by the &quot;AFD Construction company&quot;. The DJ might as well have added that she was heading for San Serriffe. Nothing steamed past, but the hoodwinked ones left their mark. So many congregated on a small patch that a rack developed in the cliff and several days later, fortunately when no one was around, a chunk crashed into the sea. Google&apos;s moon base, 2004 Google&apos;s deliberate mixture of spoofs with genuine announcements about new products on April Fool&apos;s Day is fascinating. The ethos seems to run through the entire firm; I was delighted to find an email on an April 1 internet thread from a Google employee saying that &quot;of course&quot; the milk in his office fridge that day had been dyed green. So one more handclap, please, for Google&apos;s spoof moon base, Copernicus, which advertised for staff in 2004 to survey the internet from an unparalleled vantage point and answer questions such as, &quot;Does spam go on for ever?&quot; The job also involved harvesting faint electromagnetic pulses in a way that could recreate the lost first appearance of Pink Floyd on BBC TV. There were plenty of clues, including a preference for employees &quot;capable of surviving with limited access to such modern conveniences as soy low-fat lattes, The Sopranos and a steady supply of oxygen&quot;. But loads of people clicked the application button that triggered a reply saying, sorry, we&apos;re full, try again on April Fool&apos;s Day 2104. \u00b7 Extracted from The Guardian Book of April Fool&apos;s Day (Aurum Press/Guardian Books, \u00a312.99).

It is snagged on a twig above a Chinese stream that&apos;s choked with rubbish from around the world. Argos and Wal-Mart logos are visible in the fetid water and along banks that are strewn with plastic bags. There is even a green and white Help The Aged carrier with a UK website address on it. Here in Mai, a village in Guangdong Province, southern China, a community of recyclers ekes out a living from items considered so worthless in the west that they are given away free and quickly discarded. Carrier bags and bottles are shipped here from London, Rotterdam, Hong Kong and cities within China for chopping, melting and remoulding into pellets. Like many jobs outsourced to China, it&apos;s dirty, smelly, labour-intensive and poorly paid. There is so much rubbish to be recycled that parts of the village look like a dump. &quot;The river is foul - we can smell it from our classrooms,&quot; says Wang Yanxia, a student at a local middle school. &quot;When it rains, the water floods on to the path and the stench is everywhere.&quot; Villagers may not have heard of Tesco, but the British high street giant has an all too visible presence. One factory has even decorated its front gates with huge plastic banners advertising a Tesco mobile phone offer. If China is the end of the line for the plastic bag, it is also the beginning. Most of the carrier bags used in Britain are made in Chinese factories just a few hours&apos; drive from Mai. From there, they travel halfway around the world, are dished out to British shoppers - and then at least some of them find their way back. The 10,000-mile odyssey between manufacturing and dumping is the story of our age, part economic miracle, part environmental tragedy. In the space of just 20 years, the fishing village of Shenzhen, in the south of China close to Hong Kong, has become an industrial powerhouse with a population of more than eight million and a container port that handles more cargo than anywhere in the world other than Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. This is where most of the planet&apos;s toys and shoes are made, where Apple outsources much of the production of its iPods, where Wal-Mart fills its shelves. And, naturally, it is also the place that makes billions of the plastic bags that briefly contain all these consumer goods. Shenzhen Delux Arts Plastics is a typical manufacturer, paying its workers about \u00a360 a month to churn out 25,000 plastic carriers every day, a fifth of which go to Europe, some to Next in the UK. It is a simple, three-part process. Bags full of plastic pellets are fed into an induction pipe, melted together at a temperature of 180C and then stretched and wound on to rolls the width of the desired bag. Next, the rolls are fed through a series of cylinder printing presses, each adding a different colour, until the logo and lettering are complete. Finally, an army of workers on the second floor carries out the more labour-intensive process of melting handles on to the bags, checking quality and packing. From start to finish, it takes just five minutes to make a bag. The production cost for each bag is less than four pence, most of which goes on machinery maintenance, management and materials. The primary ingredient is polyfabric polypropylene or other types of plastic, all of them petroleum based and imported directly from Saudi Arabia or from refineries in Singapore and Japan. The industry has a significant carbon footprint. By one estimate, the US alone requires 12 million barrels of oil for the 100 billion bags its consumers use annually. For factory manager Andy Lue, the main concern is that the cost of plastic is rising along with the surge in oil prices. &quot;Our customers would complain if we tried to pass on the extra cost of the materials,&quot; he says. The factory&apos;s main competitive advantage is labour, which accounts for less than a 10th of the production costs of a plastic bag. Wages in Shenzhen are low, and more than three-quarters of the population are migrants, many of them living in huge company dormitories far from their homes and families, and working in dirty, dangerous conditions. Over at the Delux Arts Plastics factory, pay and working conditions are above average for Shenzhen. The manager will not permit us to talk to employees, but we are introduced to &quot;group leader&quot; Chen Ping, a migrant from Guangxi Province, who tells us that the situation has improved enormously since she started working and living in the factory 11 years ago. &quot;The managers realise they must let us eat and sleep better if they want us to work harder.&quot; Chen earns more than double the average factory salary, but her life is far from easy. Because she is a migrant, her two children will have to return to their home town to go to school, which means she will see them for only a few days each year, at spring festival. But she expresses no sense of grievance, even though the consumers who use her Next bags can easily pay more for a single shirt than she earns in a month. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is unfair. We make these bags to be used. They have their own value.&quot; In Britain, plastic bags have long been a cause of irritation, partly due to their visibility. In gutters and branches, the useless, ugly flutter of discarded, brightly coloured plastic taunts us with human fecklessness. They pose problems for wildlife, they block drains. And 17 billion plastic bags a year are handed out to British shoppers. What has made them, suddenly, a very hot issue is the launch of another kind of bag - an item that has already become the status bag of 2007. This is not the reissued Chanel quilt-and-chain classic, the 2.55. It is not even the YSL Downtown, with its modish zips and snap fastenings. And - here&apos;s the thing - it costs \u00a35. There is nothing inherently remarkable about Anya Hindmarch&apos;s I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag. It is a simple, rope-handled, sturdy cotton shopping bag, albeit one that&apos;s rather beautifully designed, as you would expect from the British Accessory Designer of the Year. What is significant, however, is the reaction to it at every stage, from the sketchbook to the checkout. There have already been queues at the Mayfair store Dover Street Market, when a few preview bags went on sale. At around the same time, the British Retail Consortium has announced a voluntary initiative to reduce the environmental impact of carrier bags by 25% by the end of next year, through the use of alternative materials to make lighter-weight bags, by encouraging reuse, offering and promoting &quot;bags for life&quot;, always asking customers whether they require a bag at all and providing bag recycling points. In other words: reduce, reuse, recycle. Friends of the Earth are quick to point out that, in the context of the scale of the environmental issues with which we are faced, plastic bags, which account for only 0.3% of the domestic waste stream, are not their top priority. Even so, the average person in the UK accepts, on average, five plastic bags a week. The decision as to whether to take a bag is almost a daily one. The supermarket checkout has become, therefore, a frontline of the battle for the environment, even more so because, unlike recycling or composting of domestic waste, it is a decision we take in public, and so reflects not only personal beliefs but what we see to be public norms. It is for this reason that Decline Plastic Bags Wherever Possible is the first action suggested in the book Change The World For A Fiver. &quot;Declining plastic bags is totemic of lots of things,&quot; says Eugenie Harvey, co-founder of the global social-change movement We Are What We Do, which produced the book. &quot;It&apos;s the most visible aspect of a whole set of behaviour around shopping: do you buy environmentally friendly washing powder; do you buy locally produced food?&quot; Trevor Datson, spokesman for Tesco, calls the &quot;Do you need a bag?&quot; moment at the checkout &quot;a constant conversation between us and the customer. I was in the Sandhurst store yesterday and my colleague on the checkout remarked to me how many more people remember to bring in their own bags these days.&quot; Hindmarch&apos;s bag may help. She has a knack for reading the zeitgeist, as illustrated by the phenomenal success of her Be A Bag range, whereby family photos could be made into smart handbags, a concept that in the six years since it was launched has been copied all over the world. The low price of the I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag - a fiver - was absolutely essential to the project, Hindmarch says. &quot;And so was the point of sale, which had to be the supermarket checkout.&quot; Hindmarch is, however, a businesswoman, and as such knew that too many \u00a35 Anya Hindmarch bags on the market would damage her upmarket brand. (To put the price in perspective, the Elrod, one of the key Anya Hindmarch leather handbag styles for this summer, sells for around \u00a3500.) Production therefore had to be limited, and so the bag had to be made in China if the figures were going to add up. &quot;That was not ideal, of course,&quot; Hindmarch concedes, &quot;but we have been careful about carbon-offsetting the project. Our aim was for the project to break even. None of the retailers involved in the project is making any money from it.&quot; A limited number of bags are currently on sale via Hindmarch&apos;s website, and from April 11, the remaining 20,000 bags will go on sale in Sainsbury&apos;s. The purpose of the Hindmarch bag is, says the designer, &quot;to cast a spotlight on the issue. Just to plant an idea in people&apos;s heads that will make them think before automatically reaching for a bag.&quot; Finding a complete solution to the plastic bag problem is extremely complicated. All the supermarkets profess commitment to the issue, but all have different policies. Tesco produces all-degradable bags and operates a clubcard scheme to reward people for reusing bags, on the principle that &quot;incentive is better than coercion, because if people do something resentfully, they are not making such a deep-seated change&quot;. Waitrose emphasises the &quot;bag for life&quot; scheme, which they were the first retailer to introduce 10 years ago. The Co-op&apos;s bags are degradable; Sainsbury&apos;s are made of one-third recycled material. The opening of the country&apos;s first organic supermarket, Whole Foods Market in Kensington, in June, may further accelerate the process of change - the store, like its Fresh &amp; Wild predecessors, will refund customers 5p for not taking a bag. Friends of the Earth, however, would like to see a government tax on all plastic bags. Degradable and biodegradable bags are &quot;not an environmentally friendly option&quot;, they say, and &quot;will lead to the public becoming increasingly confused as to what they are supposed to do with them. Degradable plastic bags usually can&apos;t be recycled with normal plastic bags, and people may think they can put degradable bags into their compost bins, which they can&apos;t.&quot; Degradable bags are still made from plastic, so placing demands on oil resources. They contain a metal additive to make them degrade and tend to require sunlight to break down. If biodegradable bags end up in landfill, they will eventually produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Paper bags are no better, say Friends of the Earth, because they have less capacity for being reused, and require more energy and resources in manufacture and transport than plastic alternatives. Bags made from recycled plastics, which are then reused or recycled, are considered by many a better option, but recycling points for bags are as yet not widely accessible. In any case, all too often, a promise by municipal government to recycle simply means sending the rubbish to China. In trade terms, it makes an odd kind of sense. Historically, British merchants have always found it easy to fill their ships with goods on the route from China, but all too often they have been stuck with empty cargo holds in the opposite direction. This trade gap is the main reason why English gunboats forced opium on China in the 19th century. Today, however, the answer is not drugs, but garbage. China exports almost \u00a312.6 billion-worth of manufactured goods and other products to the UK each year. In return, the UK sends back 1.9 million tonnes of rubbish, for the simple reason that it&apos;s cheaper than dumping it at a UK landfill site. Because the ships are almost empty on their way back to China, the cargo costs are tiny - it&apos;s cheaper to send a container of waste from London to Shenzhen than it is to truck it to Manchester. Under EU law, waste cannot be dumped abroad, but shipments for recycling are permitted. This means business for Guangdong Province, which is scattered with Steptoe and Son communities. There are the e-waste centres of Guiyu and Qingyuan, where families make a living from chopping up and melting down toxic plastics and metals from discarded computers, printers and mobile phones. Below them on the waste chain are the recyclers of plastic bags and bottles in Shunde and Heshan. Until recently, the most notorious of these was in Nanhai, a town just outside Guangzhou, where the streets were once piled high with rubbish and the streams thick with trash and pollution. Last month, however, after a series of embarrassing reports in the British media, the government was shamed into shutting down the entire area and banning imports of foreign garbage. Today, the streets of Nanhai are swept clean and the small recycling sheds are shuttered up. For many locals, however, this sudden concern about the environment is a financial disaster. &quot;We were ordered to close last month because some foreign rubbish contained toxins,&quot; says Ding Chunming, who used to process bottles and bags. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible blow because we only started this business last year. We get no compensation. All we can do is wait and hope the government allows us to restart business.&quot; But the industry has learned how to bypass laws and regulations. Many Nanhai refugees simply moved their scrapheaps to a new location. Two hours&apos; drive away, we found a new recycling centre under construction in Shijing village. The concrete is still wet on the floor and many of the sheds are only half complete, but the task of buying, selling and sorting rubbish is already in full flow. The operation is remarkably specialised. There are sections just for discarded hotel welcome mats, the bases of revolving chairs, black buckets and the lids of shampoo bottles. A local businesswoman, who gave her name only as Ms Liang, was terrified that another critical news report would force her to relocate again. &quot;We have only just got here from Nanhai,&quot; she says. &quot;I have never dealt with foreign waste. I can&apos;t do it now and I won&apos;t do it in the future.&quot; But for others the trade in foreign waste is too lucrative to disappear quickly. We were approached by a scrap dealer who asked if we had any rubbish to sell. He was after PVC, but he put us in touch with a factory in Shenzhen that said it could deal with carrier bags despite the ban. &quot;It can be done as long as the plastic is well enough packaged to get through customs,&quot; says the owner. &quot;You should ship them to Hong Kong and we will deal with them from there. If the bags are sorted by colour, we can pay you as much as $100 a tonne.&quot; Farther away from the media spotlight and the scrutiny of environment officials, many factories are still reprocessing British carrier bags and other rubbish despite the government&apos;s ban. Another hour&apos;s drive away is Shunde, where European trash is baled up on the roadside. Much of it is from the UK - Tesco milk cartons, Walkers crisp packets, Snickers wrappers and empty packets of Bisto gravy and Persil powder - but there are also bales containing the packaging for Dutch confectionery and Italian nappies. The village of Mai is close by. Running through the community is a street of recycling firms, outside each of which stands a blackboard detailing the type, colour and quality of the plastic they deal in. Some are no bigger than a shed in which migrant workers sift by hand through hundreds of thousands of tiny plastic pellets, picking out discoloured flecks and bits of fluff. Mai Weibo buys semi-processed bags for 9,000 yuan a tonne (around \u00a3600) and, after painstakingly cleaning up the contents, sells the plastic on for 10,500 yuan - &quot;We don&apos;t make much of a profit.&quot; The recycled plastic is not of sufficiently high quality to be used a second time for UK bags, so instead much of it is turned into red, white and blue plastic sheets, which are used for building site coverings and holdalls. Many locals believe the pollution is ruining their health. A local doctor says the village suffers from an unusually high incidence of respiratory diseases. &quot;Perhaps it was the pollution or perhaps it was because everyone smokes cigarettes,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a sensitive topic. Of course we want a garden-like environment, but people here have to make a living.&quot; Others say they have other priorities. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the environment,&quot; says one migrant labourer. &quot;I only want to make money. If your stomach isn&apos;t full, how can you worry about health?&quot; Everyone condemns as an eyesore the ditches full of carrier bags, but nobody seems to take responsibility for clearing up the mess. In fact, the main concern of local businessmen and government officials is to avoid scrutiny. &quot;The government has banned imported waste because of the media attention,&quot; says one local factory manager, whose warehouse includes giant baskets full of rubbish from the UK. &quot;The Nanhai recycling business has been shut down. This area doesn&apos;t want to suffer the same fate because it would hurt the government&apos;s income.&quot; Britain&apos;s stance is also equivocal: dumping waste overseas is forbidden, but sending it to another country for recycling is acceptable. When told of the foul conditions at Mai, an official at the UK consulate in Guangzhou says that individual companies have to take action. &quot;It is the responsibility of producers to make sure that waste is dealt with properly at all stages of the chain.&quot; Foreign governments have started to take action specifically on plastic carriers, some going much further than Britain&apos;s retailers and their aim for a voluntary 25% reduction in bag use by 2008. Ireland, for example, introduced a 15p &quot;plastax&quot; on carrier bags way back in 2002, which has subsequently led to a 90% reduction in use. Australia has launched a &quot;Say No To Carrier Bags&quot; campaign. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the government has obliged supermarkets to charge for bags at least two days a week. Italy is promoting the use of biodegradable bags. In France, reusable plastic bags - which are heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - now account for more than half of the \u00a4770m market. Inevitably, however, even those eco-bags are made in Shenzhen. The main producer is the Richall Group, which must be one of the world&apos;s fastest-growing companies. Launched in 2003 with starting capital of just \u00a31,000, last year it recorded sales of more than \u00a33m, and this year that figure is expected to triple, thanks to business from Sainsbury&apos;s, Unilever, Disney, Budweiser and Nestl\u00e9, all of whom are looking towards reusable bags. Richall&apos;s president, Liu Tianyan, says attitudes are changing but, more importantly, so are materials. &quot;We&apos;re never going to get rid of plastic bags completely, because in some cases, such as food wrappings, there is no good substitute. But in the case of shopping bags, I believe the flimsy plastic can be completely replaced.&quot; Not everyone thinks that would be a good thing. Peter Woodall, communications manager for the Carrier Bag Consortium, says, &quot;It&apos;s important to forget the emotion and look at the science. We are not filling our landfill with plastic bags. That is simply a myth. When real science is taken into account, the best environmental choice is plastic. Life-cycle analysis shows that if you use a conventional bag four times and then recycle it, that is better than using a &apos;bag for life&apos;.&quot; Environmental campaigners, meanwhile, believe the only solution is to make rich countries deal with their waste locally. &quot;That&apos;s the only way to make the whole community feel the impact,&quot; says Kevin May at Greenpeace&apos;s office in Beijing. &quot;If you can easily dump waste overseas, then there is no motive for having a waste-reduction programme at home. The argument that developing nations need recycled resources from wealthy nations is only partly true. The environmental costs are too high. Just look at the filthy water and polluted air of China. If we can stop the waste trade, I am sure it will lead to more sustainable development around the world.&quot; The apparent intractability of the plastic bag problem is all the more remarkable considering that our dependency on them is a recent phenomenon. Polythene was not even invented until the 30s, and plastic bags did not become common in supermarkets until the 70s. The idea that we can&apos;t live without them is a very modern one."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/31/featuresreviews.guardianreview33", "sentences": ["They could keep the Borders brand, running it as a franchise (a model that works for Borders in Malaysia and Singapore)."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-31T22:58:51Z", "title": "The bookseller: Mar 31", "tags": ["Books", "Publishing", "Culture"], "article": "\u00b7 Having an American parent company has many advantages - not least the deep pockets - but such companies tend to regard international operations as little more than a sideshow. That&apos;s the case at Borders: after nearly a decade of heavy investment in becoming a leading player in UK and Ireland bookselling, a new US boss has cut the purse strings. The news was sudden but not entirely unexpected: Borders&apos; critics have long argued that its &quot;superstore&quot; format - warehouses in city centres and out-of-town retail parks - won&apos;t work over here, given the higher rents and intense price competition. Yet even the critics acknowledge that Borders has boldly tried to reinvent bookselling, encouraging shoppers to spend hours moving between magazines, DVDs, Paperchase stationery, CDs, deep ranges of books, and Starbucks. The most likely next move is a buyout by management, headed by former Waterstone&apos;s product director David Roche. They could keep the Borders brand, running it as a franchise (a model that works for Borders in Malaysia and Singapore). This would enable them to tailor the look of the shops more closely to British and Irish tastes, rather than being constrained by American brand guidelines. The likelihood is that its London-based Books Etc chain will be sold off. But Roche knows that raising cash for a buyout will be a challenge: Borders is viewed as part of the &quot;entertainment&quot; market which is being eroded by online downloads. A rival retailer could outbid the management team, but it is unlikely that Waterstone&apos;s or WH Smith will have the appetite for a superstore expansion. \u00b7 Given all the headlines about celebrity books &quot;flopping&quot; last Christmas, you may have expected publishers to steer well clear this year. Not a bit of it. The stampede actually whetted the appetites of editors, each of whom is convinced they have the &quot;right&quot; celeb for Christmas 2007. With the record-breaking sales of Peter Kay&apos;s autobiography, other comedians are in demand: Hodder will release a book from Russell Brand, while publishers are bidding \u00a31m-plus for Jack Dee and Dawn French. The other big theme is music: prepare for memoirs from Eric Clapton, Charlotte Church, Jools Holland, Patti Boyd, Ozzy Osbourne and Jason Donovan. Then there&apos;s Richard Attenborough, Helen Mirren, Paul O&apos;Grady ... and even Fidel Castro. \u00b7 As Tesco&apos;s head of books, Caroline Ridding wielded huge influence over publishers. Her buying meetings were legendary, with sales teams given a few minutes to present their titles before Ridding tore into them, telling them to redesign covers to appeal to Tesco shoppers. But last year, soon after being named the second most powerful person in the book industry by the Observer, she joined HarperCollins. Her brief was to build an unashamedly mass-market list called Avon, aimed at time-pressed women. She has taken a supermarket-style approach, identifying the three most popular genres for her audience: chick lit, romance, and crime/thrillers. From July Avon will release one title in each genre every month, from British and American authors. Ridding is selling the list herself to retailers; she says they have borne no grudges, and the feedback has been &quot;fantastic&quot;. \u00b7 Barely a year seems to pass without a re-evaluation of William Shakespeare&apos;s life. And this year sees more than most. Ren\u00e9 Weis&apos;s Shakespeare Revealed will be first to hit the shelves, closely followed by Shakespeare the Thinker - the magnum opus of Anthony Nuttall, the Oxford professor who died in January. Then this autumn two more biographies are due: Bill Bryson&apos;s Shakespeare: A Short Life and Charles Nicholl&apos;s The Lodger: Shakespeare on Silver Street. Bryson&apos;s effort forms part of HarperCollins&apos; &quot;Eminent Lives&quot; series, and the publisher is promising he will &quot;unravel the superstitions, academic discoveries and myths surrounding the life of Shakespeare&quot;. Nicholl, meanwhile, takes as a starting point evidence given by the Bard in a lawsuit involving his landlords at the Court of Requests in Westminster - the only time when his spoken words are recorded. &quot;The mists in which Shakespeare&apos;s life is shrouded suddenly part and you see &apos;one Mr Shakespeare&apos;, as the maid called him, in the upper room of the house, writing Othello and Measure for Measure, with a family of wigmakers on the floors below,&quot; says Penguin Press publishing director Stuart Proffitt.  \u00b7 Joel Rickett is deputy editor of the Bookseller"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/01/politics.comment", "sentences": ["He who had woven his placatory skills so spectacularly all those years ago in Northern Ireland, who had single-handedly wooed Olympic delegates in Singapore, who had unfurled a lasting dynasty of specialised school systems in front of a disbelieving and confused British public, was now about to embark on his greatest and eternal triumph; no less than the total elimination of all Terror."], "publicationDate": "2007-03-31T23:13:46Z", "title": "Armando Iannucci: Mr Blair's awfully big adventure", "tags": ["Politics"], "article": "June 2007, Geneva The Peace Conference that no one thought would ever happen opened up for its first session. Delegates from around the Middle East, some of them sworn enemies, patiently filed in and posed for the cameras sitting sociably next to each other and in front of bottles of Perrier water and gavels. Syria was there, and so was Iran. Their arrival had been difficult enough to organise, but was simplicity itself compared to the fraught negotiations expended in bringing representatives of Sunni and Shia militia groups into the chamber. Here sat Hezbollah; opposite them (a triumphant coup de grace for the conference organisers) the leadership of al-Qaeda. At one end of the table sat the US President, at the other, the UK Prime Minister. The latter looked best pleased as this, his lasting legacy, was put into place in front of him at this table. He who had woven his placatory skills so spectacularly all those years ago in Northern Ireland, who had single-handedly wooed Olympic delegates in Singapore, who had unfurled a lasting dynasty of specialised school systems in front of a disbelieving and confused British public, was now about to embark on his greatest and eternal triumph; no less than the total elimination of all Terror. The delegates smiled and posed, the cameras shuttered and flashed, and soon these moments of levity were over, the journalists left the room, the doors were shut, the gavels were clacked, and the serious business began. In seconds, the American President leapt into action. Hurling a smoke bomb at the door, it went off, THWANG! as it hit the ground, spewing out a mind-deadening cloud of pink fumes. The delegates started to cough and splutter on the acrid puffs of pink pain, while the American President at one end of the room and the UK Prime Minister at the other swiftly covered their faces with masks concealed in their documents. As all the other delegates slumped forward unconscious, the President pulled two automatic weapons from his attache case, hurling one of them, SLLOOOOM! across the polished oak table to his UK colleague, who smiled back at him a sweet smile of boyish excitement. All those months of special training had been leading up to this, all those briefings, the jousts in the midnight dust, the painful brawling sessions in pitch black with men called Jock and Stan, real soldiers of men, and in his head he was running all those complaints from those around him: &apos;why don&apos;t you go, go now, leave us, we&apos;ve had enough of you&apos; and re-running too his constant mental refrain: &apos;They don&apos;t know. I need time to do this. I need to learn this right.&apos; Wait! One of the delegates had come to and it was a matter of mini-seconds for the Prime Minister to conch her unconscious with his steel-rimmed boot. BRAAFF! Through the noxious smog he could see it was his own Foreign Secretary. Friendly Fire. He smiled at the irony. Meantime, the US President had pointed his weapon at the al-Qaeda delegates and pulled the trigger in a shock of noise: BOOFT! BOOFT! BOOFT! The lifeless, cracked heads of the three greatest threats to the world&apos;s security fell limply to the ground like half-peeled lychees slumping onto the intricately patterned carpet. SLOOTHP! SLOOTHP! SLOOTHP! The remaining manoeuvres were carried out with android precision. TWOOM! Another bullet in the head, this time through the eye-socket of the leader of Hezbollah. SKRRRINK! A garrotte to the neck of the spokesman for Hamas. Like slicing through a ripe pear. BNUB! BNUB! Two quick reports into the brains of the Sunni insurgents. CHLUP! A pen in the eye of the Iranian military attache, a mark of warning, mightier than any sword. By now, the inevitable bangs on the doors were being heard. Crowds and forces had gathered outside, ready to burst through. The US President and the UK Prime Minister caught each other&apos;s gaze, and knew instantly what their next action would be. In among the groans and mayhem, the blood and the Perrier, they slowly walked towards each other, arms outstretched and connected in embrace. The hug was heartfelt, and final. A pull of the cord from the US President, a slight look of momentary surprise from the UK Prime Minister, and up they went together, KRUBOOOOM!, blown apart in terminal self-detonation, their limbs and brains mingling with the chosen colours of the explosive smoke-canisters strapped to their inside legs, red, white and blue. In the patriotic chaos, their heads flew across the room like drop-kicks from a fateful Jonny Wilkinson, the American President&apos;s head displaying grim, quiet certainty, the UK Prime Minister&apos;s showing the startled look of a man who hadn&apos;t been planning this bit but now that it was happening was happy to go along with it. For here, at last, he had met his triumph: everything had truly been sorted out once and for all.

TV TIMES &quot;With the BBC losing their latest big contract, I got to wondering when the first live televised football matches took place in Britain,&quot; writes Robert LeBries. &quot;Can you help?&quot; Four years before Kenneth Wolstenholme uttered his first words on Match of the Day, ITV broadcast the first ever live League game on British television, Robert. As detailed in Gary Imlach&apos;s excellent book, My Father and Other Working-Class Football Heroes, ITV agreed a deal with the Football League to cover 26 league games in the 1960-61 season. &quot;And on September 10 1960 Blackpool&apos;s home game with Bolton became the first live match on British television. But the first Big Game was a flop. ITV put their cameras high up behind the goal at Bloomfield Road rather than on the halfway line in the main stand. The critics complained that the commentators overpraised what everyone could see was a poor game, and talked about a packed house when the crowd was only 17,000 in a ground that held twice as many.&quot; By the time Newcastle travelled to Arsenal for ITV&apos;s next feature, the Gunners&apos; board refused entry to the cameras. &quot;The deal collapsed,&quot; adds Imlach, &quot;ITV withdrew their offer, and in the fallout from the whole affair the BBC did the same with their proposal to show FA Cup games.&quot; It wasn&apos;t as if television companies hadn&apos;t covered live football before, however. Twenty-three years earlier, the BBC had televised the 1937 FA Cup final on May 1 between Sunderland v Preston - in part - before an estimated 10,000 audience got to enjoy Preston&apos;s return against Huddersfield a year later in its entirety. Yet historians at Arsenal deliver a conflicting view, claiming it was they who broadcast the first ever British game of football. &quot;On September 16 1937, parts of a match between the club&apos;s first team and reserves was broadcast live,&quot; claims their website. &quot;This was the first time that people from up and down the length of Britain had been able to watch a game of football live.&quot; A WIFE LESS ORDINARY (2) Last week we skimmed into the slightly murky world of players with the same name as their wife, but it seems some notable examples went amiss ... &quot;The AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Henk Timmer married Marianne Timmer, the Olympic speedskating gold-medallist,&quot; writes Nick Den Uijl. We&apos;re hoping they weren&apos;t related already, Nick. &quot;Though they do not share their first names, she did not need to change her family name.&quot; &quot;The former Tranmere, Millwall and Blackpool player Chris Malkin had a wife also called Chris Malkin,&quot; notes Steve McCann, who was joined in our inbox by Katie Booth, who says that she &quot;happens to know that Franco Zola&apos;s wife is called Franca.&quot; And it appears that Emlyn Hughes wasn&apos;t alone in going for the obvious when it came to naming his kids. &quot;Count me among those mentioning the tousled blonde beauty that is Pavel Nedved and his wife Ivana,&quot; adds James Richardson, formerly of television, &quot;who, after much thought, named their his-n-hers matching children &apos;Pavel&apos; and &apos;Ivana&apos;. Presumably so they could raid their trust funds.&quot; That&apos;s almost as good as George Foreman calling his five sons George and his daughter Georgetta, James.

KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;I recently read that Philippe Troussier has managed six different national sides (South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Japan and Qatar). Surely no one else can match that?&quot; wondered Tom Nicholls back in 2005. They can and they have, Tom. First up is the man who has coached the most international games ever (276 - 104 clear of his nearest rival): Bora Milutinovic. In a career spanning 21 years and 96 days in charge of national teams, the Yugoslav has managed six different sides: Mexico, United States, Costa Rica, Nigeria, China and Honduras. For more information, check this link out. But leaving Milutinovic well and truly in the shade is Rudi Gutendorf. Incredibly, his management career lasted 53 years and took in 17 national managers jobs in charge of Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Grenada, Antigua, Botswana, Australia, New Caledonia, Nepal, Tonga, Tanzania, Ghana, Nepal again (but we won&apos;t count that), Fiji, Zimbabwe, Mauritius and Rwanda. Oh, and he also took charge of the Iranian and Chinese Olympic teams in 1988 and 1992, respectively. When asked once why he had managed in so many different countries, the German replied: &quot;One cannot conserve excitement.&quot; If you want a complete rundown on his extraordinary career, albeit in German, click here.

The biggest, I suppose, is Guitar Hero which will be coming to a handset near you soon, courtesy of Hands-On.

It would be interesting if they found a way to use real sound clips. But again, Java is a virtual platform with limited access to the phone&apos;s other functionality so I&apos;m not sure how that could pan out. &quot;The lifestyle of music is strongly immersed into our everyday culture, and having Guitar Hero on mobile platforms will now allow our dedicated fans the opportunity to passionately feel the music, anytime and anywhere,&quot; is all that the improbably named Dusty Welch, head of publishing at RedOctane, will say on the matter. But what of the screenshots above? Well, the one on the left is SCX, a forthcoming slot car racing title based of course on Scalextric (but, no doubt due to some complex licensing issues, can only be called that in Spain, Russia and Mexico). Publisher LemonQuest is promising six-player slot action, as well as the ability to change brake tension or fuel load, as well as choosing the pit-stop strategy. This all sounds more complicated than when I used to play Scalextric (I had the one with the two minis that could do 180 degree turns by skidding fast on corners). Then, it was just a challenge to keep the cars on the track for more than two laps - and there&apos;d always been one bent bit of slot that the car stopped on. Anyway, the isomertic visuals look nice and Super Sprint-esque. One thing though - there seems to be no track construction mode! What an oversight! The second screenshot is of the amazining-looking Come On Baby, &quot;The world&apos;s first mobile infant game,&quot; declares publisher Ozura. The game, I think, has already been released in Singapore, but is getting a global roll-out. It&apos;s all based around nappy changing, feeding, etc. The graphics look a bit Cooking Mama (which, incidentally, is also coming to mobile phones in the UK soon).

The Institute for Public Policy Research study, published today, also suggests that Whitehall can learn from two young upstarts: the Scottish Executive and Welsh assembly government. It says that the current policy-making process is &quot;closed and insular&quot;, has little connection with actual delivery and fails to learn from either previous successes or its failures. A &quot;baronial&quot; culture prevents departments from cooperating as closely as they should. The IPPR research says that the disconnection between top politicians and senior officials will persist without reform of the service. It claims that the longstanding tradition of holding ministers accountable for everything that happens in their departments severely undermines the accountability of officials. The report argues that an independent body outside Whitehall should regularly assess all departments, and parliament should be given enhanced powers to hold ministers to account, and new powers to keep checks on civil servants. The authors, Guy Lodge and Susanna Kalitowski, say: &quot;It would be perverse, in our view, not to pay particular attention to ... smaller states - notably places like Finland, Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore - who tend to be at the cutting edge of reform.&quot; They praise initiatives in Japan, which evaluate policy throughout its formation - not just after the event - and Singapore, which has developed a programme to ensure that the innovative ideas and experiences of public servants on the frontline are fed back into policy making. They also suggest that in Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands, civil servants are more active in seeking out the expertise and knowledge of of outsiders in business and academia. The report argues that senior officials should have to spend time in local government or other areas of public service to ensure they have experience of delivery as well as policy formation - as happens in France, thanks to its unified civil service. The IPPR report comes amid renewed controversy over the relationship between officials and ministers, following Sir Andrew Turnbull&apos;s attack on Gordon Brown for being &quot;ruthlessly Stalinist&quot;, and the release of advice to the chancellor on pensions reforms."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/apr/06/business.mauritius.lisbon", "sentences": ["San Francisco (with the Golden Gate bridge), Madrid (the Plaza Mayor) and Singapore (Boat Quay) are classic examples."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-06T09:55:35Z", "title": "Business traveller's diary: March 18 to April 2", "tags": ["Travel", "Business travel", "Mauritius holidays", "Lisbon holidays", "Business"], "article": "Flights: 9Miles flown: 11,155Destinations: D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich, London, Lisbon, Nairobi, MauritiusNights in a hotel: 13Nights on a dancefloor: 5Satisfaction rating: 9.82/10 What a relief. After a first quarter of hard, productive labour, I have finally managed to extricate myself from my bespoke suit and woven-silk tie. Yes, Max has finally made it on a long holiday: to a sumptuous private villa at the Taj Exotica Resort in Mauritius, via a luxury safari at the extraordinary Il Moran camp in Kenya&apos;s Masai Mara.  And, as I write this happy dispatch, I have finally arrived at a state of rare inner peace. My shorts are beginning to feel like a second skin; my Sweeney brogues a distant, slightly distasteful memory. But, I must confess, this nirvana has taken four entire days to reach. The extrication from formal wear is not a simple change of clothing, as every BlackBerry-wielding workaholic will tell you. It is, in fact, an immensely tricky change of mindset.  We incessantly talk of the need for a &quot;getaway&quot;, a paradise beach to relax on or time alone with our long-suffering families. But as the Boeing 747 hits 36,000 feet, we begin to feel a searing sense of trepidation. Did I leave at the wrong time? What&apos;s happening at work today? Have I missed a critical email? Is my team functioning without me? All nonsense, of course, but somehow unavoidable. There are no simple tips either; no easy switch to flick. The progression from suit to shorts does take time; and perhaps the best strategy is to embrace it. Do a little email to start off with; answer the phone if it makes you feel more secure; think about how you&apos;ll restart with a bang if that helps you to relax. And for every moment of quasi-labour, compensate with a double dollop of holiday indulgence. Play tennis in the day, swim for long periods, read a thrilling book, reflect on your new-found sense of wellbeing and consider smugly how your holiday spot compares to your stale, fetid team room. And, perhaps most importantly of all, don&apos;t worry: soon enough, your work obsession will fade.  Anyway, time to move on \u2013 or at rather, backwards. My last fortnight&apos;s business had been conducted in D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich and Lisbon, the latter a rare destination for me \u2013 and, I presume, for most of you. And the three-day stint in Portugal&apos;s premier city provided some food for thought. We live in an era of league tables, the rich list and top 10s where almost everything in our lives gets rated. Fashion magazines rate moisturisers and handbags; current affairs journalists rank American presidents and corrupt regimes; the Daily Mail rates everything. And nothing gets ranked more than travel. Our current obsession with flying away is fuelled by all sorts of lists: the best restaurants, the finest hotels, the cheapest airlines, the most spectacular spas and so on and so forth. Even I&apos;ve fallen into the trap in this column in past weeks. But I&apos;ve never seen the ranking I think we business travellers really need: a rating of cities. Perhaps, it&apos;s the fear of offending a city&apos;s inhabitants or the extreme subjectivity of such an exercise that tends to preclude it. But cities do fall into tiers and we need to know which tier a city falls into if we are to prepare adequately for a visit. In-depth analysis is obviously impossible in such a column but let&apos;s at least scratch the surface. A tier one city, defined by a panoply of options, significant size, vibrant dynamism and rich history \u2013 so London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong \u2013 calls for a certain approach. You should make time in your work schedule to explore; you should search hard for a particular corner that you love; you should sample a broad variety of restaurants, hotels, bars and nightclubs; and you should keep trying to go back once you&apos;ve left.  A tier two city, meanwhile, will be smaller and less manic, but still blessed by sophistication, beautiful people and, critically, a sight or two of stunning uniqueness. San Francisco (with the Golden Gate bridge), Madrid (the Plaza Mayor) and Singapore (Boat Quay) are classic examples. You should position yourself in the centre of the action; research and book the best five restaurants in the city; and fly your loved ones out for a weekend in a place that they might not otherwise get to. But it&apos;s the tier three cities that you should be wary of. Your work may take you there but your inner travel agent should take you away again as soon as possible. It pains me to say that I&apos;d rate Lisbon as the quintessential tier three urban destination. It has an excellent reputation in certain circles, largely founded perhaps on its proximity to Spain, and as a first-time visitor I had visions of stunning architecture, great food and bucket-loads of human beauty. But I found Lisbon as flat as a pancake with nothing at all to make you gasp. Its hotels are old-school, with chandeliers instead of sharp lines and naff in-house restaurants instead of hip bars. I found the food to be almost universally shoddy, with tired ingredients and exhausted recipes. If only someone had told me Lisbon was tier three before I went \u2026 Enough of all that, I&apos;ll be back in a fortnight.

It is snagged on a twig above a Chinese stream that is choked with rubbish from around the world. Argos and Wal-Mart logos are visible in the fetid water and along banks strewn with plastic bags. Here in Mai, a village in Guangdong province, southern China, a community of recyclers ekes out a living from items considered so worthless in the West that they are given away and quickly discarded. Carrier bags and bottles are shipped here from London, Rotterdam, Hong Kong and other Chinese cities for chopping, melting and remoulding into pellets. Like many jobs outsourced to China, it is dirty, smelly, labour-intensive and poorly paid. There is so much rubbish to be recycled that parts of the village look like a dump. &quot;The river is foul - we can smell it from our classrooms,&quot; says a student. &quot;When it rains, the water floods on to the path and the stench is everywhere.&quot; If China is the end of the line for the plastic bag, it is also the beginning. Most of the carrier bags used in Britain are made in factories a few hours&apos; drive from Mai. From there they travel halfway around the world, are dished out to British shoppers - and then at least some of them find their way back. The 16,000km odyssey between manufacturing and dumping is the story of our age, part economic miracle, part environmental tragedy. In 20 years the fishing village of Shenzhen, in the south of China close to Hong Kong, has become an industrial powerhouse with a population of more than 8 million and a container port that handles more cargo than anywhere in the world other than Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. This is where most of the world&apos;s toys and shoes are made, where Apple outsources much of the production of its iPods, where Wal-Mart fills its shelves. It is also the place that makes billions of the plastic bags that briefly contain all these consumer goods. Shenzhen Delux Arts Plastics is a typical manufacturer, paying its workers about $120 a month to churn out 25,000 plastic carriers every day, a fifth of which go to Europe. Bags full of plastic pellets are fed into an induction pipe, melted together at a temperature of 180C and then stretched and wound on to rolls the width of the desired bag. The rolls are fed through a series of cylinder printing presses, each adding a different colour, until the logo and lettering are complete. Finally an army of workers carries out the more labour-intensive process of melting handles on to the bags, checking quality and packing. From start to finish the process takes five minutes. The production cost for each bag is less than eight cents, most of which goes on machinery maintenance, management and materials. The primary ingredient is polyfabric polypropylene or other types of plastic, all of them petroleum-based. By one estimate the US requires 12m barrels of oil for the 100 billion bags its consumers use annually. The Delux factory&apos;s main competitive advantage is labour, which accounts for less than a 10th of the production costs of a plastic bag. Wages in Shenzhen are low and more than three-quarters of the population are internal migrants, many of them living in huge company dormitories far from their homes and families, working in dirty, dangerous conditions. Delux&apos;s pay and conditions are above average for Shenzhen. We are not allowed to talk to employees, but we are introduced to &quot;group leader&quot; Chen Ping, a migrant from Guangxi province, who says the situation has improved enormously since she started working and living in the factory 11 years ago. &quot;The managers realise they must let us eat and sleep better if they want us to work harder.&quot; Chen earns more than double the average factory salary, but her life is far from easy. Because she is a migrant, her two children will have to return to their home town to go to school, which means she will see them for only a few days each year at spring festival. But she expresses no sense of grievance, even though the western consumers who use her bags can easily pay more for a shirt than she earns in a month. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is unfair. We make these bags to be used. They have their own value.&quot; Plastic carrier bags are totemic of all kinds of issues to do with shopping - food miles, food packaging, profligate waste. They pose problems for wildlife. They block drains. Friends of the Earth says plastic bags, which account for only 0.3% of the UK&apos;s domestic waste stream, are not its top priority. However, it would like to see a tax on the 17 billion bags that are handed out to British shoppers every year. Degradable and biodegradable bags are &quot;not an environmentally friendly option&quot;, it says, and &quot;will lead to the public becoming increasingly confused as to what they are supposed to do with them. Degradable plastic bags usually can&apos;t be recycled with normal plastic bags, and people may think they can put degradable bags into their compost bins, which they can&apos;t.&quot; Degradable bags are still made from plastic, continuing to place demands on oil resources. They contain a metal additive to make them degrade and tend to require sunlight to break down. If biodegradable bags end up in landfill, they eventually produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Paper bags are no better, says Friends of the Earth: they are less easily reused and require more energy and resources to make and transport than plastic alternatives. Bags made from recycled plastics, which are then reused or recycled, are considered by many to be a better option, but recycling points are not yet widely accessible. In any case, all too often a promise by municipal government to recycle simply means sending the rubbish to China. It is cheaper to ship a container of waste from London to Shenzhen to truck it to Manchester. Under EU law waste cannot be dumped abroad, but shipments for recycling are permitted. This means business for Guangdong province. There are the e-waste centres of Guiyu and Qingyuan, where families make a living from chopping up and melting down toxic plastics and metals from discarded computers, printers and mobile phones. Below them on the waste chain are the recyclers of plastic bags and bottles in Shunde and Heshan. Until recently the most notorious of these was in Nanhai, a town outside Guangzhou, where the streets were piled high with rubbish and the streams ran thick with pollution. In February, however, after a series of embarrassing reports in the British media, the government was shamed into shutting down the area and banning imports of foreign garbage. The streets of Nanhai are swept clean and the small recycling sheds are shuttered up. For many locals, however, this sudden concern about the environment is a financial disaster. &quot;We were ordered to close last month because some foreign rubbish contained toxins,&quot; says Ding Chunming, who used to process bottles and bags. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible blow because we only started this business last year. We get no compensation. All we can do is wait and hope the government allows us to restart business.&quot; But the industry has learned how to bypass laws and regulations. Many Nanhai &quot;refugees&quot; just moved their scrap heaps. Two hours&apos; drive away a recycling centre is under construction in Shijing village. The concrete is still wet on the floor and many of the sheds are only half-complete, but the task of buying, selling and sorting rubbish is in full flow. The operation is remarkably specialised. There are sections for discarded hotel welcome mats, the bases of revolving chairs, black buckets, the lids of shampoo bottles. One businesswoman, terrified that another critical news report will force her to relocate again, says: &quot;We have only just got here from Nanhai. I have never dealt with foreign waste. I can&apos;t do it now and I won&apos;t do it in the future.&quot; But for others the trade in foreign waste is too lucrative to disappear quickly. We were approached by a scrap dealer who asked if we had any rubbish to sell. He was after PVC, but he put us in touch with a factory in Shenzhen that said it could deal with carrier bags despite the ban. &quot;It can be done as long as the plastic is well enough packaged to get through customs,&quot; says the owner. &quot;You should ship them to Hong Kong and we will deal with them from there. If the bags are sorted by colour, we can pay you as much as $100 a tonne.&quot; Further away from the media spotlight and the scrutiny of environment officials, many factories are still reprocessing carrier bags and other rubbish from abroad despite the ban. Another hour&apos;s drive away in Shunde, rubbish from Europe is baled up on the roadside - British milk cartons, Dutch confectionery packaging, Italian nappies. Nearby in Mai, many villagers believe that the pollution is ruining their health. A doctor says the village suffers from an unusually high incidence of respiratory diseases. &quot;Perhaps it was the pollution or perhaps it was because everyone smokes cigarettes,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a sensitive topic. Of course we want a garden-like environment, but people here have to make a living.&quot; Others have different priorities. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the environment,&quot; says one labourer. &quot;I only want to make money. If your stomach isn&apos;t full, how can you worry about health?&quot; Everyone condemns as an eyesore the ditches full of carrier bags, but nobody seems to take responsibility for clearing up the mess. In fact the main concern of businessmen and officials is to avoid scrutiny. &quot;The government has banned imported waste because of the media attention,&quot; says one factory manager. &quot;The Nanhai recycling business has been completely shut down. This area doesn&apos;t want to suffer the same fate because it would hurt the government&apos;s income.&quot; Other countries are tackling the problem at differing speeds. British retailers will aim for a voluntary 25% reduction in carrier bag use by 2008. Elsewhere governments have started to act. Ireland introduced a &quot;plastax&quot; of about 30 cents on carrier bags in 2002, which has led to a 90% reduction in use. Australia has launched a &quot;Say No To Carrier Bags&quot; campaign. In Taiwan and Hong Kong the government obliges supermarkets to charge for bags at least two days a week. Italy is promoting biodegradable bags. In France reusable plastic bags - heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - account for more than half of the market. Inevitably even those eco-bags are made in Shenzhen. The main producer is the Richall Group. It was launched in 2003 with starting capital of less than $2,000. Last year it recorded sales of more than $6m. This year that figure is expected to triple. Richall&apos;s president, Liu Tianyan, says attitudes are changing. More importantly, so are materials. &quot;We&apos;re never going to get rid of plastic bags completely, because in some cases, such as food wrappings, there is no good substitute,&quot; he says. &quot;But in the case of shopping bags, I believe the flimsy plastic can be completely replaced.&quot; Not everyone thinks that would be a good thing. Peter Woodall, communications manager for the Carrier Bag Consortium, says, &quot;It&apos;s important to forget the emotion and look at the science. We are not filling our landfill with plastic bags. That is simply a myth. When real science is taken into account, the best environmental choice is plastic. Life cycle analysis shows that if you use a conventional bag four times and then recycle it, that is better than using a &apos;bag for life&apos;.&quot; Environmental campaigners believe that the solution is to make rich countries deal with their waste locally. &quot;That&apos;s the only way to make the whole community feel the impact,&quot; says Kevin May at Greenpeace&apos;s office in Beijing. &quot;If you can easily dump waste overseas, then there is no motive for having a waste-reduction programme at home. The argument that developing nations need recycled resources from wealthy nations is only partly true. The environmental costs are too high. Just look at the filthy water and polluted air of China. If we can stop the waste trade, I am sure it will lead to more sustainable development around the world.&quot; The apparent intractability of the problem is all the more remarkable considering that our dependency on the plastic bag is a recent phenomenon. Polythene was not even invented until the 1930s. Plastic bags did not become common in supermarkets until the 70s. The idea that we can&apos;t live without them is a very modern one.

How do? I&apos;ve just hotfooted it here from the Holloway Road, where the streets are predictably thronged with excited, agitated people. There is barely room to move between the crowds. They are of course, excited cricket fans, emblazoned with green and gold and red, the colours of today&apos;s two teams. I&apos;m told the same thing is happening down on the banks of the Thames, round about Hammersmith way, where battalions of frenzied fans are gathered on the banks and in the pubs, all awaiting the toss of the coin and the start of the game. It&apos;s the same story all across the world of course: Winnipeg, Cadiz, Nairobi, Singapore. And, no doubt, where ever you are...or not, let me know.   It is, of course, the 34th match of the World Cup that is at the front of everyone&apos;s minds today. And who couldn&apos;t understand that? Bangladesh have never beaten South Africa. Ever, In any form of the game. In fact, they&apos;ve never come close to beating them. Four Tests: all lost by an innings and plenty. In seven one-day games they&apos;ve never come nearer than 83 runs. It must be the most uneven record between any two Test nations.   And it&apos;s easy to se why. I&apos;m not looking to cast aspersions on the South Africans, but you don&apos;t have to strain your imagination or exceed your poetic licence to label them as bullies. They invite the comparison with the type of cricket they play - aggressive, dominant and unrelenting, rude, brash and powerful. And if there was ever a schoolyard victim of a cricket team, it was Bangladesh. With an average age of just 24 and some seriously naive performances with bat and ball under their belt.  Bangladesh are the flat track of the sport and you know what bullies do on flat tracks in cricket. Except that is exactly what we have in Guyana today: a flat track. A damp, squashy pitch under overcast skies. And the one thing that might save the Bangladeshi bacon is the thirty overs of left-arm-spin they&apos;ll produce in the middle of the match. On a slow low sub-continental pitch the South Africans may not be quite so happy. One thing is for certain - they don&apos;t like spin.    It&apos;s hard not to be charmed by Bangladesh, like the little kid who plays sidekick to Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom, they&apos;re young, plucky and talented. But don&apos;t let anyone tell you that because they&apos;re kids they play without pressure. There are 150million people in Bangladesh, and cricket is the most popular sport. Expectation is immense, and it hasn&apos;t been met by the three successive defeats to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Effigies of captain Habibul Bashar have reportedly been burnt in the streets. Coach Dav Whatmore has publicly said he&apos;s like the Indian coaching job, and that has prompted the Bangladeshi Cricket Board to hold an emergency meeting. If the players didn&apos;t know pressure at the beginning of this tournament, they do know: such are the consequences of success.   South Africa have won the toss and will bowl.  Their team looks like this: GC Smith, AB de Villiers, JH Kallis, HH Gibbs, AG Prince, JM Kemp, MV Boucher, SM Pollock, A Nel, CK Langeveldt, M Ntini. So Nel, the angriest man in cricket, is in for Hall.   Bangladesh look like this: Javed Omar, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Saqibul Hasan, Habibul Bashar, Mohammad Ashraful, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafe Mortaza, Mohammad Rafique, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel.   Interesting things poetic licences. All journalists get tested for them, at a cottage down in Kent by a pair of batty wavy-haired old men. They&apos;re not essential, but if you don&apos;t much like facts they help. I&apos;ve got a grade-three licence, due for renewal next year. I&apos;m hoping to get an upgrade. &quot;Licence to Kill?&quot; the man asked. &quot;No, licence to bullsh..&quot; the hack replied.   1st over: Bangladesh 0-0 (Omar 0 Iqbal 0) A little late swing for Pollock, as he sends down a series of dot balls wide outside off stump. Omar has a foolish waft at the third of them, bringing a slight grin to Pollock&apos;s chops. &quot;I hope the Bangladeshi&apos;s bat first and tonk the Saffer&apos;s attack all over the park and the Jaques Kallis decides that his average needs a bit of improvement and hits a 50 off 150 balls and South Africa to finish 30 runs short.&quot; Andy Bradshaw has another 99 overs for his wishes to come true, but boy did they look unlikely in that first over.   2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Omar 0 Iqbal 8) Ntini&apos;s first ball is a gross wide. His second is the sweetly dispatched to the cover boundary with a good-looking down on his knee drive by Iqbal. &quot;Cheers from the land of the cricket-free, Andy. Is it true that the ICC have, at last, relented and reversed their idiotic ban on musical instruments at the grounds?&quot; can&apos;t tell you Lou Roper, but I&apos;m guessing you&apos;ve not made it up, &quot;If so, though, isn&apos;t this, predictably, the least likely match to produce proper Caribbean revelry?&quot; Yes it is. The ground is as quiet as the GU chapel on a sunday morning. Ntini finds that customary angle across the left hander. Too far across him in fact as Iqbal throws his bat in a loose cut shot and the ball flies past the slips and down to third man for four more.   3rd over: Bangladesh 12-0 (Omar 1 Iqbal 9) Singles from the first two balls. The next is a wide. Morning Gary Naylor: &quot;Does anyone want to give Andre Nel a shout? I&apos;m glad to have him back, lending a bit of character to the Saffers&apos; souless side. I long for the chance to see a &quot;Nix and Nel Show&quot; which pits them together in tight close-up, like Griff and Mel, as they riff about cricket, sledging, anything.&quot; What a great idea that is. I&apos;m sure Channel Five would be game.   4th over: Bangladesh 12-0 (Omar 1 Iqbal 9) A healthy dose of grumbling from Andrew Morgan: &quot;Your comments about South Africa seem similar to what everyone always says about the Aussies. In the case of Australia I can understand that to a large extent it&apos;s jealousy and frustration at your own incompetence, but what is the problem with S Africa? With the exception of calling them rude, most of the characteristics you ascribe to them seem to me to be essential parts of a winning mentality. I honestly don&apos;t know what spirit you want the game played in. I&apos;m not a fan of sledging, and I believe in walking if you know you&apos;re out, but surely you HAVE to be aggressive, dominant and unrelenting? Maybe England should try it more often?&quot; There are plenty of less plesant things we could say about South Africa, hopefully someone else will do it for me and save me the libel costs. Gibbs? Nel? Boucher? Healthy doses of vile sledging? Muscular Christianity? I&apos;m alright for all that thanks.   5th over: Bangladesh 13-0 (Omar 2 Iqbal 9) The TV cameras are very pointedly showing us all the schoolkids in the ground today. No musical instruments yet though. More shots follow of the walrus-like Dav Whatmore on the balcony, rubbing his forehead with a meaty palm as his boys block out another Pollock over.   6th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Omar 3 Iqbal 13) Omar clips a run behind the wicket. Iqbal steps down the pitch to Ntini, which can&apos;t happen very often, even if he does end up blocking the ball out to short extra cover. &quot;Is sub-continental burning of captains&apos; effigies the most tedious, most unimaginative, most predictable reaction to defeat this side of Jeff Powell suggesting Terry Venables is the man to take the reins from Steve McClaren? Do they sell effigies in shops complete with blue touch paper? Treating captains like Edward Woodward in &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; just isn&apos;t on in 2007.&quot; Well Naylor, you&apos;re spot on. But I always wonder if there are western photographers giving the effigies to the crowds and setting light, just because they know it&apos;s guaranteed to make the papers back home. Iqbal punches two down the ground and clips another piar off his hip.   7th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Omar 7 Iqbal 13) Pollock bowls a wide ball and Omar delights in belting it away for four with a cracking square cut. The ginger miser responds with a bouncer that slides down the leg side, which will only anger him more.   8th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Omar 8 Iqbal 18) Omar edges one down to third man. Bull plays a straight bat. Barry Richards waffles. And there is Tamim Iqbal putting all of us to shame: three steps down the pitch and he carves Ntini high over extra-cover and over the ropes for four. I love this guy, I really do.   9th over: Bangladesh 34-0 (Omar 13 Iqbal 18) Omar fancies a bit of the boundary himself, and pops up onto the balls of his feet, leaning into the ball and flicking it away square, where it runs on and comes to rest right up on the rope.   10th over: Bangladesh 36-0 (Omar 14 Iqbal 19) Ntini roars out an lbw shout that goes nowhere fast, as plumb as it looks to everyone else it doesn&apos;t convince Billy Doctrove. Smith has a grumble in Ntini&apos;s ear and past him on the back in encouragement.   11th over: Bangladesh 36-0 (Omar 14 Iqbal 19) Boucher comes up to stand at the stumps and shout some inanities in the batmen&apos;s ears: &quot;Come on Polly! We&apos;ve got &apos;em on the rack here boys! I like it! I like it!&quot; To prove the point here&apos;s a link from Phil Harrison, which, as I don&apos;t have time to check it, I&apos;m taking on trust isn&apos;t going to link the GU to some particularly unpleasant pornography: &quot;Most people have probably seen this but it&apos;s worth another look as a reminder of how unpleasant the South Africans can be. &apos;Bully&apos; is the only word. You certainly wouldn&apos;t get anything this charmless from the Badger...&quot;  12th over: Bangladesh 40-0 (Omar 16 Iqbal 20) Here&apos;s the angry man Nel then. And he&apos;s much quicker than either Ntini or Pollock with his first ball. Of course he follows through three-quarters of the way down the pitch and bites his lip in Iqbal&apos;s face. Ntini, clearly offended by the way Iqbal treated him this morning squawks away incomprehensibly in the outfield. It all makes no difference: Iqbal knocks one through point, Omar adds two of his own to the same area. Nel bowls a filthy ball a yard outisde off and then gurns at the batsman like an old man with a mouthful of hard gums.   13th over: Bangladesh 42-0 (Omar 17 Iqbal 21) Iqbal flicks a run off his own edge and in and out of Boucher&apos;s gloves. Lou Roper, here&apos;s your confirmation, assuming Sunil X is a reliable enough source for you: &quot;Actually the Bajan LOC (local organising committee) has said it will allow musical instruments, local food and kids for free into the ground..&quot; Just the Bajan LOC? Or is that Windies-wide?   WICKET! Omar c Smith b Nel (14th over: Bangladesh 42-1)  Nel explodes into life as Omar carves one of his worst deliveries straight to Smith at point. That&apos;s about it really - simple stuff. A bad ball, a good shot and a better catch. They&apos;ve pushed the woebegotten and runless captain Habibul Bashar up to no3. Nel nips back an off-cutter at at ferocious pace. A wicket maiden for Nel, but, as the commentator points out: &quot;he&apos;s still angry&quot;.   15th over: Bangladesh 47-1 (Iqbal 27 Basahar 0) Langeveldt, on of the most surprising successes of the Cup so far, is on. Iqbal knows what&apos;s what though and thrashes his second with a startling, swinging, cut that sends the ball over extra cover for four runs. Bashar, by distinct contrast, looks more than a little uneasy at the crease. Who could blame him, with just 51 runs in the tournament so far and crowds calling for his head back home. Langeveldt, looking every inch the former prison warder he is, snarls as Bashar plays and misses at a wide ball.   16th over: Bangladesh 51-1 (Iqbal 29 Basahar 2) Just 11 runs in that last power play. Iqbal drops the ball down to his feet and sprints the single. That allows Bashar to score his first with a thick edge that squirts to square leg.   17th over: Bangladesh 59-1 (Iqbal 33 Basahar 5) &quot;Just followed the link in the 11th over. Didn&apos;t sledging used to have some kind of wit or humour involved or is South African sledging defined by a distinct lack of anything except rather dull insult?&quot; Clare Davies gives the YouTube link short shrift. What is Boucher saying in this clip then? Anyway, Langeveldt bowls a no-ball and Bashar plays it down through point. That&apos;s more like it, Iqbal slams a pull straight down the ground through long-on and away for four.   WICKET! Bashar 5 c&amp;b Nel (18th over: Bangladesh 62-2)  Nel takes a rather fantastic reaction catch, plucking Bashar&apos;s straight drive out of the air with his right hand even as it was disappearing down to the long-on boundary. Time seems to stop for a split second, in that manner only possible after a startling moment of sport, and then Nel tosses the ball over his shoulder, and Bashar breaks out of his gaunt stare and trudges off the pitch, tucking his bat underneath his arm as he goes. Saqibal comes in. A leg bye and a no ball and that adds a couple more. He adds an absurd wide, all venom and menace. I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll begrudge the penalty given the statement it made.   19th over: Bangladesh 65-2 (Iqbal 34 Saqibul 0) A leg bye, a no ball and a flicked drive to third man. Yep, that&apos;s all you&apos;re getting from me for this over.  WICKET! Iqbal c Boucher b Nel (20th over: Bangladesh 73-3) Iqbal plays a tail-enders hook shot off the finest of edges past Boucher&apos;s head and past where the longstop would stand if it was 1807 rather than 2007 for four lucky runs. That&apos;s as far as his fortune stretches though, as he tries to pull the next through mid-wicket and toe-ends an easy catch into Boucher&apos;s gloves. He&apos;s gone, and that could mean a collapse is coming. Nel has three for 13. Make that three for 17 as the new batsman, Ashraful, glides away a poor yorker for four runs to the square leg fence. Having celebrated the wicket like it was news of his first born, the boundary turns Nel&apos;s face into a sour grimace.   21st over: Bangladesh 74-3 (Saqibul 1 Ashraful 4) A real shame for this game that Iqbal tossed his wicket away with that shot. The man is going to grow into such a fine batsman. As will Saqibul, who has just scored his first run with a sneaky little single to mid-on.   22nd over: Bangladesh 79-3 (Saqibul 3 Ashraful 4) Saqibal essays a rather ropey looking pull that clears mid-on but doesn&apos;t get anywhere near the boundary. Anyone who doesn&apos;t; think South Africa are a team of bullies - just Andrew M on the dtrength of protests so far - just needs to tune in to the highlights and watch the abusrd manner in which the six-foot-something Nel is staring down these 18 and 19-year-old Bangladeshis as though they&apos;d just called his mother a trollop.   23rd over: Bangladesh 84-3 (Saqibul 9 Ashraful 4) Phil Harrison wants to atone for his last duff link with this effort: &quot; Here&apos;s some witty, grown-up sledging. Watch and learn, Boucher...&quot; It&apos;s going to be &quot;mind the windows Tino&quot; isn&apos;t it? I just know it even though I haven&apos;t checked. Saqibal rides a cut down to the ropes in front of point for four. What&apos;s happened to Tino Best? He could be as much of a comically angry quick as Nel if only he were in the Windies&apos; squad.   WICKET! Saqibal 9 c Smith b Kallis (24th over: Bangladesh 84-4)  Jacques Kallis comes into the attack. I can tell you actually, that Tino Best has signed a contract to play club cricket in Derbyshire, so he&apos;ll be bringing his own particular brand of tiny fury to a the north of England some time soon. He was more than a bit rubbish at Test level actually wasn&apos;t he? Mind you, he could hardly worsen the form of the Windies team at the moment. Oh and Saqibal has gone, cutting straight to Smith at point much as Omar did.  Somewhere deep in the bowels of the GU beast a hamster has stopped running around his wheel and as a consequence my TV has broken down. While we wait for some cheese wotsit gobbling types to pop up from the basement, please hum to yourselves. I&apos;d suggest the Dambusters theme....  27th over: Bangladesh 100-4 (Ashraful 8 Ahmed 5) Well here we are then, back in action. Graeme Smith seems to have brought himself on while we were away. Phil Harrison defends himself: &quot;My first link wasn&apos;t duff!&quot; Did I say it was? Oh, yes I did. &quot;It made my point about the Saffers&apos; general charmlessness. And no, this one isn&apos;t &apos;mind the windows, Tino&apos;. And I&apos;m going to link you to some animal porn soon if you don&apos;t check them first.&quot; Still haven&apos;t checked - what is it if it&apos;s not Tino?   28th over: Bangladesh 102-4 (Ashraful 11 Ahmed 6) Ashraful guides two down to third man, as Kallis is still sweatily steaming in at the other end.   29th over: Bangladesh 109-4 (Ashraful 12 Ahmed 11) Satyajit Mujumdar has the right idea, catching a dose of the fever: &quot;Andy, from Miami: its crazy out here as Bangla and Proteas supporters have literally brought this sunshine city to a grinding halt as drug deals are on hold, babes in south beach bare bangla bikinis, and sexagenarian touristas in havana shirts wear &quot;Andre Nel&quot; temporary tattoos on their temples. America is finally realizing the global power of cricket.&quot; And with Graeme Smith bellowing out a futile shout for caught behind as Ashraful bagily plays out another mediocre over, who can blame them for rioting in the sunshine state. Aah, our excessive sardonicism comes to naught as Ahmed chips a delightfuly drive over mid-on and away for four.   30th over: Bangladesh 117-4 (Ashraful 20 Ahmed 11) Ashraful gloves a bouncer away for four through fine leg. Kallis ia annoyed and repeats the ball, allowing Ashraful to smash him away in front of square with a mighty pull shot. Ho ho, poor old Jacques.   31st over: Bangladesh 117-4 (Ashraful 21 Ahmed 12) Pollock returns to the fray. Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. And that&apos;s one, which spoils my gag entirely, perhaps I could exercise my lience and pretend it didn&apos;t happen. And there&apos;s another run. This over is a write off.  33rd over: Bangladesh 128-4 (Ashraful 28 Ahmed 14) Well I missed the 32nd over, but whatever happened, it brought the Banglas eight runs. There is a little news too: Herscheele Gibbs has gone off with a calf strain and will only reappear to bat if South Africa need him too. &quot;Can you please tell Satyajit to be more careful: &quot;Andre Nel&quot; and &quot;bikini&quot; really don&apos;t belong in the same sentence. I may not be able to sleep tonight.&quot; quips Bob O&apos;Hara, though he&apos;s inadvertantly repeated the crime - I wonder if you secretly like the fact that you&apos;ll not be sleeping tonight Bob?   34th over: Bangladesh 136-4 (Ashraful 29 Ahmed 16) Aftab drives one to cover with a neat little shot. As he swipes his bat round to leg and picks up four runs as the ball trickles away fine off his pads, Barry Richards produces a good stat, which is that only Sanath Jayasuriya hit more sixes in ODIs last year than Aftab. Surprising stuff that, unlike almost every other word that&apos;s come out of the Sky box during this tournament so far.   35th over: Bangladesh 139-4 (Ashraful 32 Ahmed 17) Pollock, still wicketless, enters his last over of the day. The batsmen trade squiffy singles down to third man, Ashraful with a deliberate glide, Aftab with a more ungainly edge. Somewhere in the world Steve James, famous for scoring 92.98% of all his runs behind square, must be loving this partnership.   36th over: Bangladesh 152-4 (Ashraful 32 Ahmed 29) Here&apos;s the seventh bowler then, Justin Kemp, his efforst with the ball every bit as innocuous as his batting is over-the-top. And so it proves: Aftab hits one of those sixes, his ninth of the year so far, with a tremendous pick up that flies over the backward square boundary and into the crowd. And theer is his tenth! This one another pick up, but in front of square. He just picked Kemp&apos;s slower delivery and slapped it a very long way indeed over mid-wicket and about twenty rows back.   37th over: Bangladesh 158-4 (Ashraful 34 Ahmed 33) Langeveldt is back on. Four more runs come, clipped ever so fine to leg with a Swiss tick-tock&apos;s worth of timing. These two have now put on 74 off 80 balls.   WICKET! Ahmed 35 c Nel b Ntini (38th over: Bangladesh 160-5) Smith, just a touch flustered, brings Ntini back at the other end. And it&apos;s worked, Aftab biffs a drive up into the air and it lands safely in the hands of Andre Nel at deep point.   39th over: Bangladesh 167-5 (Ashraful 41 Rahim 1) Rahim comes to the middle and quickly gives Ashraful the strike. He wafts a hook around the corner to fine leg for four runs. &quot;Have the &apos;desh got a chance here?! If they were doing this to England we&apos;d all be having coronaries by now&quot; points out Phil Harrison, I assume he sent that just moments before Aftab pissed his wicket away.   40th over: Bangladesh 171-5 (Ashraful 42 Rahim 2) Ian Smith is banging on about how South Africa&apos;s slow over rate is eating into his dinner time, which is a thoroughly depressing piece of commentary for all too many reasons. Another wide. Ashraful plas an absurdly ambitious cover drive and misses the ball by a square foot&apos;s worth of fresh air.   41st over: Bangladesh 175-5 (Ashraful 46 Rahim 3) Something of Hoggard about Langeveldt&apos;s bowling here, lacking the conditions to ply his prime trade, swing, he&apos;s resorting to banging the ball in on a length outisde off stump. It&apos;s enough to tie up Rahim, until Langeveldt&apos;s line drifts a little onto middle, and he&apos;s tucked away for one. Sanjay Majrekar attributes the large crowd here to Guyana&apos;s being the largest Island in the Windies, neatly displaying an appalling grasp of geography.   WICKET! Rahim 6 run out Kemp/Boucher (43rd over: Bangladesh 181-6) Angry Andre Nel returns to see if he ca bluster out the Bangladeshis&apos;. And so he can: Ashraful clips a lovely drive past Kemp at mid-off, and what should be a simple single is spoiled by Rahim&apos;s atrocious ball watching. Ashraful was coming back for two, Rahim wasn&apos;t, and one of them had to go as Kemp threw in. Rahim had the grace to make it himself and not the man on 47. Mortaza is in, and he too takes an early single. Nel chucks a wide down leg and adds a belly-high full toss next ball.   44th over: Bangladesh 196-6 (Ashraful 61 Mortaza 2) Ashraful brings up his fifty with a superb straight drive over Ntini&apos;s head. He adds another four runs with that oh-so-cheeky stepping across to off and scooping the ball down to fine leg shot that has been so prominent a development in this tournament. He batters two more with a miscued slog over cover as well. He rejects Barry Richard&apos;s suggestion that he should be sensible and look for a single to keep the strike and swats four more runs past a diving third man. Fifteen off the over, excellent, inventive and audacious batting by Ashraful.   45th over: Bangladesh 208-6 (Ashraful 65 Mortaza 10) Mortaza gets in on the fun with a baseball style bunt down past long-off and across the ropes. Mortaza scoops the ball to short fine leg for another. By the time Ashraful has glanced the last ball behind square leg for four more, the South African bowling is looking seriously creaky, while the Banglas are very chipper indeed.   46th over: Bangladesh 221-6 (Ashraful 66 Mortaza 24) Richard Jones says what we&apos;re all thinking: &quot;With a little luck &apos;les Banglas&apos; may set a reasonable target here, which SA might not find so easy. It&apos;s interesting that all the other so-called preferred sides seem to get some troublesome opposition along the way except Australia.&quot; Oh but wait till tomorrow Richard, I&apos;ve a feeling in my bones that England may have saved their best game of the tournament for the Aussies.... Meanwhile, Mortaza goes long and big, huge in fact, with a towering straight six that disappears over the ropes behind the bowler. Ntini just can&apos;t get his line right, and his last ball is swatted away for another four to leg by Mortaza. What a late knock this is!  47th over: Bangladesh 233-6 (Ashraful 75 Mortaza 25) A stunning shot by Ashraful draws the highest praise from Barry Richards. It was an effortless late-cut, played with a straight bat, that simpl sped over the turf and bounced over the ropes at third man. These two have put 48 off 27 balls, and even when Langeveldt bowls an excellent yorker Mortaza moves to leg and squeezes it away for one. And what a shot that is! Superb wit from Ashraful, with that extraordinary shovel-scoop from outside off flying away around the corner and down to the fence at fine leg. He drives two more to mid-off and moves to 75, and boy, when the Banglas bat well, they&apos;re just brilliant.   WICKET! Mortaza 25 b Nel (48th over: Bangladesh 239-7) Nel does what&apos;s needed with a fast, full yorker that beats Mortaza&apos;s late swipe and shatters his stumps. An excellent 25, probably the best he&apos;s ever made. It almost justified Nel&apos;s dragon punch dance and beetroot faced screaming celebration. Ashraful scoops him away again, for four more from a yard outside off stump. The ball loops over short fine leg. He takes a single off the last to keep strike going into the 49th over.   49th over: Bangladesh 246-7 (Ashraful 87 Rafique 2) Rafique scrapes a leg bye to put Ashraful back where he ought to be. And that is stunning! The sweetest of Sachin-esque extra cover drives that just skims through the air and hops across the ropes at long-off while the batsman holds his pose and admires his shot. He takes one more down the ground and Rafique batters a run to cover. Langeveldt and Ntini have been thoroughly dismantled by this excellent innings from Ashraful.   WICKET! Ashraful c Langeveldt b Nel (50th over: Bangladesh 251-8) Ah, he&apos;s undone by the simple expedient of pushing fine leg back to the boundary. Ashraful plays that scoop again and the ball sails into Langevedlt&apos;s open hands. An excellent innings by Ashraful, one of the most enjoyable I&apos;ve seen in this World Cup. Memories of Cardiff and that famous victory over the Aussies are hard to avoid, given that it was Ashraful who set up that upset with his century. It&apos;s been joyful cricket by the Banglas, all the better for being against the dour Sarffers. Nel, who has carried this attack on his own, has finished with two dot balls to go with his five wickets.  And all of a sudden we&apos;ve a game on. Gibbs is missing, and the South Africans will need to be prepared to attack the spinners, which will be tough enough. This could be fascinating...."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/apr/08/architecture", "sentences": ["He also has offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing and Toronto which he visits regularly."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-07T23:10:52Z", "title": "Lynn Barber meets Will Alsop", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "I thought architects came in Armani suits with shaven heads and peculiar glasses. Will Alsop, in his crumpled black shirt, black jacket and long, lank, greying hair, looks more like a hairy biker - amazingly scruffy and obviously not a man familiar with gyms. His favourite watering hole is the Chelsea Arts Club, which to put it mildly is not the place to order wheatgrass juice. He smokes even more than me. At one point he tells me he is 59 then pauses and adds, &apos;You&apos;re supposed to say I don&apos;t look it.&apos; Oh, OK, I tell him, leaving open the question of whether he looks older or younger. Actually 59 is still quite young for a top architect because architecture is a famously late-flowering profession - Philip Johnson started a new practice when he was 90. But with Alsop you slightly wonder if he&apos;ll make old bones. Since his Peckham Library won the Stirling Prize in 2000, Alsop probably counts as number three in the hierarchy of British architects, after Lords Rogers and Foster. His recent building for Goldsmiths College, New Cross, and the Blizard Building, his science institute for Queen Mary&apos;s College in Whitechapel, won rapturous praise - the Guardian called the latter &apos;rational and romantic, questioning, quixotic and necessary&apos;. Other much admired buildings include the Hotel du Departement (seat of regional government) in Marseille which was his first big commission and the Ontario College of Art and Design. The former is known as Le Grand Bleu because it is blue, the latter as the Dalmatian because it has black and white spots. His buildings often have playful elements - strong colours, blobby shapes, and stilts at crazy angles - but they are functional too. When I said something about the &apos;wonky legs&apos; of the Peckham Library he corrected me sharply: &apos;There is a good structural reason for putting the legs at an angle. Not that I believe in having to justify everything you do, but if you have straight legs in parallel you have to put in some bracing otherwise they might shift sideways but if you have a series of legs at angles they&apos;re bracing the lateral load anyway, so there is a reason for it. People say, Oh, that&apos;s just Will being wilful but not a bit of it.&apos; He once said he could best teach his students about load-bearing by making them form a human pyramid. Anyway, his buildings stand up, they are weatherproof, and the people who use them like them, which is more than you can say for some famous architects. And he is good fun. He has a dry wit and merry chortle. His studio in Battersea is a bright and bustling place, full of eager-beaver young things, with his own colourful abstract paintings round the walls. He believes that cheerfulness is important and that &apos;Being an architect is to some extent a performing art because you&apos;ve got to keep people up, you&apos;ve got to keep the whole situation buoyant and I&apos;ve noticed that the best and most successful projects are when everyone just keeps smiling. Architects are the only profession that actually deal in joy and delight - all the others deal in doom and gloom. Yet it&apos;s surprising how many architects dress as though they&apos;re accountants, and behave like accountants. They manage to make something that should be thoroughly enjoyable into a rather dull grind.&apos; It is noticeable that accountants often feature as bogeymen in his conversation - his father was an accountant. But he was 64 and already retired by the time Will was born. The family were comfortably off and lived in Northampton. Neither parent showed the slightest interest in architecture - though Will recalls that his mother was very houseproud and liked rearranging furniture, which might be relevant. When he was six he designed a house for her to live in - its most striking specification was that it had to be built in New Zealand. He always wanted to be an architect, even before he really knew what architects did. But he remembers that there was one modernist house in Northampton, New Ways, designed by Peter Behrens in 1926 and actually the first Modern Movement house in Britain, and his mother took him to see it, though she always used to say how ugly it was. The lady who lived there gave Will and his twin sister ice cream, &apos;And it was really good ice cream, so maybe that had a certain positive effect.&apos; When Alsop was 16 his father died, so he decided to leave school, where he was bored, and do his A-levels at evening classes while working for a local architect. (&apos;Even today I think, Why are these kids going to school full-time to do A-levels? They don&apos;t need to.&apos;) He did a foundation course at Northampton Art School and thence to the Architectural Association (AA) where he entered the competition to design the Pompidou Centre in Paris and was runner-up to Richard Rogers. His first proper commission was a swimming pool for Sheringham in Norfolk in 1984 (the start of a love affair with the Norfolk coast) and then a visitor centre for Cardiff Bay. After that he got a lot of work in Germany, including the Hamburg Ferry Terminal, before beating Norman Foster in the competition to build the Marseille Hotel du Departement in 1994. But even then, the work still didn&apos;t exactly flow. &apos;I came back here and went round to see potential clients and they&apos;d say they wanted to see what you&apos;d done - and I&apos;d say, the Hotel du Department, because I was proud of it and it was well received - and they&apos;d say, Yes, but what have you done here. I&apos;d say, But I built this in a foreign language, 800 miles away, on time, on budget - all the things you say - and they&apos;d say, Ah, but it doesn&apos;t count because it&apos;s not in Britain. Scary.&apos; (He says it was even worse for Richard Rogers - he was out of work for two years after he built the Pompidou Centre.) But he gradually got more commissions in his fifties and is probably now one of the busiest architects around. However, Alsop was never very good at handling the finances and, after several rocky patches (especially when his major &apos;Fourth Grace&apos; project for Liverpool was cancelled), he sold his practice last year to the design conglomerate SMC for \u00a31.8m. He says that&apos;s fine - it allows him to concentrate on architecture. &apos;I think you have to have the intelligence to recognise that you&apos;re not a good businessman and therefore find someone who loves money to look after that aspect for you. I worked for some other architects before I started on my own, and one of them I thought was rather good but he could have been better had he spent less time looking at VAT returns. And I decided then that I didn&apos;t go through seven years of training and meandering and travelling and trying to educate myself to end up doing VAT returns.&apos; He and his wife (they have three grown-up children) live between an Edwardian mansion flat in London and a converted stable block in Norfolk. But why hasn&apos;t he built his own house? &apos;Lots of people ask me that. And the answer is: I rather like my wife. If I built my own house, she&apos;d leave me. So I feel very comfortable not doing that, though of course I often have daydreams about it.&apos; In fact he has built his own studio in Norfolk - &apos;Sheila was very happy about that because it got me out of the house! But I spend a large proportion of the day talking or thinking about new buildings so it&apos;s quite nice to go home and have her taste imposed on me. And I do like her taste. She likes antiques and I don&apos;t dislike them at all. She&apos;s very good at making things comfortable - somewhere you can curl up on the sofa in front of the fire and just veg out looking at telly with a glass of wine, and I&apos;m very happy to do that.&apos; He tries to veg out at weekends as much as possible and also takes a month off in the summer to go painting in Majorca with his friend Bruce McLean. He is a strong believer that &apos;the Victorian work ethic drags us down&apos;. But actually he has a pretty hectic schedule - when I met him he was just back from Delhi and Vienna (where he is professor of architecture) before leaving for New York. He also has offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing and Toronto which he visits regularly. He says he doesn&apos;t mind all the travelling - &apos;The trick is to make sure you go in the proper class! Otherwise you would die, simple as that&apos; - but he still thinks of himself as very much an English architect and spends as much time thinking about, say, Croydon (&apos;Croydon is pregnant with opportunity&apos;) as Yonkers, New York, where he is converting a disused power plant into a residential tower with shops, museum and swimming pool. He has more projects on the go than he can actually list - the next one to be opened will probably be &apos;Chips&apos;, a residential building which is part of his big master plan for New Islington, Manchester. Isn&apos;t it difficult keeping all these balls in the air? &apos;Well, that brings into question the business of how you actually work. At architecture school, generally speaking a group of students are set a project and given a term to do it. And I think this creates the wrong mindset, because they&apos;re given 10 or 12 weeks to do a really simple project. So then they start doing &quot;research&quot; and getting up late and going to the bar - and that&apos;s all right, that&apos;s what being a student is all about. &apos;But what it means in the profession is that when a project comes along, they think you have to take a long time to do it. Whereas Lutyens said, Sometimes I&apos;ll go and have a drink with someone on my way home and get a new project. But if I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do with it before supper, I know it&apos;s going to be difficult. He had this idea that you could see the essence of the project in 20 minutes.&apos; And is Alsop the same? &apos;Well I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any rules. Some things take longer but sometimes you do see very quickly what you can do. And of course the older you get, the quicker - not always but often - because you have a whole body of stuff to draw from.&apos; He has an equally brisk approach to site inspections. When I asked how long he spent familiarising himself with a site before designing for it, he said, &apos;Oh, sometimes five minutes. Some sites you can just drive past if there are no distinguishing features - as long as you know where it is and where south is, that&apos;s enough.&apos; You need to know where south is for the light - in China, he says, you can&apos;t sell an apartment if it doesn&apos;t have south light. Is that feng shui? I asked. &apos;No, it&apos;s common sense!&apos; What he does like doing is consulting local people about what they want for the area. He devotes much time to holding workshops and asking people what their town means to them, and what they would like to see there. He believes that we all crave civic identity and that that&apos;s what&apos;s missing in much of Britain. &apos;I get them to do all the work and then I sit down and try to make sense of what they&apos;re talking about. And they&apos;re quite usefully mad in a way. The politicians and planners make terrible assumptions about a lack of imagination in the general public, but they&apos;re much more imaginative and what they&apos;re really saying by and large is that they want the place that they live in to have an identity and be different from anywhere else.&apos; Alsop&apos;s architectural heroes are Le Corbusier, Sir John Soane, Mies van der Rohe and John Vanbrugh, which shows a typical eclecticism. I tried to goad him into being snide about some of his British contemporaries, especially Foster and Rogers, but he said, No, they all have their good points, and he likes the fact that so many different styles can co-exist. &apos;With architecture today there&apos;s no predominant style or methodology - it&apos;s more open that it has ever been in history and that&apos;s a good thing because it allows people like Quinlan Terry to do what he does and me to do what I do and others to do what they do, and as long as we all do it well and with commitment, I think that&apos;s terrific because it means we get some sort of variety in our towns and cities. It&apos;s the variety that&apos;s important. The most dangerous thing for architecture is to have a theory, because then it&apos;s all the same.&apos; Unlike most architects, he thinks Prince Charles was right to make his carbuncle speech in 1984 because: &apos;It shook things up, it brought architecture more into public consciousness. And it was the beginning of a broadening out, whereas before the Modernists had had it all their own way. I&apos;m not against Modernism either - it&apos;s what I was brought up on - but it was time to stir it up and he did.&apos; Alsop even has a good word for Poundbury, Prince Charles&apos;s model village of &apos;traditional&apos; houses in Dorset. &apos;I can cope with Poundbury! I wouldn&apos;t do it myself but I can appreciate that it has certain qualities - an element of surprise, an element of disorder - that people respond to. Whereas they don&apos;t respond to the clean lines and rationality of modernism, because we are not rational by and large.&apos; The awful thing about being an architect, I&apos;ve always thought, is that you spend half your time designing buildings that never get built. Alsop says that actually it&apos;s far more than half - usually only about 10 per cent of your designs are ever built. But that&apos;s fine, he says - even when he has no particular commission or competition in mind, he likes designing buildings. &apos;It&apos;s like tennis - you have to keep doing it all the time, whether you have a client or not. I believe that absolutely. You can speculate in your sketchbook - you&apos;re allowed to think about anything, with or without a client.&apos; He recently designed an ideal prison and researched it by staying in HMP Gartree and talking to prisoners. Now his thoughts are turning to hospitals, and he has been reading up Le Corbusier&apos;s ideas for a hospital (never built) in Venice: &apos;He thought that as soon as patients were in shuffle mode they needed somewhere to shuffle to, so he designed what was basically a club overlooking the lagoon with leather armchairs, a bar, smoking! And where the boys could meet the girls and possibly fall in love. So I thought it was those sorts of ideas that are missing in our ideas for hospitals.&apos; I do hope Alsop builds a hospital one day - I would enjoy shuffling along to his club. And with any luck he will, because he has no plans to retire, ever: &apos;I still feel that all my best work is yet to come.&apos; He has the rare knack of making buildings that people enjoy using. But he won&apos;t explain how he does it because &apos;If you can explain it, you spoil it&apos; and also you risk creating a theory or set of rules, which is the last thing he wants. &apos;I think it&apos;s good to have some sort of mystery, which is best left unexplained.&apos; But his approach to architecture can broadly be defined by his statement: &apos;I like people. I hope it shows.&apos; Five of the best Alsop buildings Hotel du Department des Bouches du RhoneMarseille, 1994Alsop&apos;s breakthrough, won in a competition against Norman Foster, among others. Most significant building in Marseille since Le Corbusier&apos;s L&apos;Unite d&apos;habitation. Alsop specified a &apos;light-sucking blue&apos;. Locals call it The Whale. Palestra BuildingSouthwark, London, 2006 Even Alsop&apos;s fans (and I am one) see this as an oafish one-liner, all mouth and only flimsy trousers. Peckham LibraryLondon, 2000Won the 2000 Stirling Prize. Alsop&apos;s cantankerous artiness lends itself to projects in challenging urban areas. The library, whose form is inspired by an open book, was realised for a very modest budget. This exuberant, colourful building has attracted record attendances. Sharp Centre for DesignToronto, 2004Alsop would have been a sculptor had he not been an architect, although at times his designs owe as much to wilful aesthetics as to functional priorities. A madly decorated box on irrationally splayed stilts. Ben Pimlott BuildingGoldsmiths College, London, 2005A labour of love for Alsop, whose own designs often begin with sculpture or painting. Another eccentrically decorated shed: a severe cuboid form is relieved by gratuitous decorative metalwork.

Staff numbers have risen, with 20,000 more consultants and GPs and about 70,000 more nurses. The number of people on waiting lists for operations has fallen by 384,000 since 1997. Output, in the form of number of people using the service, has increased by about 3 per cent a year. The drugs bill has risen 13 per cent. 118 new hospitals and 188 GP clinics have been opened or are being built. There has been a 75 per cent increase in the number of emergency ambulance calls. The number of hospital beds has fallen by 15,000 but there is more day-case surgery. The analysis When Tony Blair first came to power, the health service was not his immediate priority. It took a spate of people dying on the waiting lists and terrible headlines to achieve a volte-face in 1999, when he pledged to bring health spending up to the level in the rest of Europe. In 2000, the government announced the biggest rise in NHS expenditure and put 1p on national insurance to pay for it. With it came a host of Treasury-driven performance targets such as shortening the waits in casualty departments. Some of the targets had perverse effects, however, and ended up putting pressure on other parts of the service. Cancer and heart disease have seen the most investment. Maternity care and mental health have not enjoyed the same largesse. The big failure has been to tackle the rise in chronic diseases linked to unhealthy lifestyles. Blair was adamant that the health service should offer patients more choice, and so allowed private companies to come in and compete with the NHS to provide quicker treatment but this has destabilised some of the NHS. There is enormous uncertainty among managers over which hospitals will survive the next two years as private units take more of their patients. Of the extra billions, 43 per cent has gone into extra staff and pay rises, probably at too fast a rate. Surveys suggest that people are broadly happy with their healthcare and still very supportive of the NHS, but large areas of dissatisfaction remain. The huge rise in hospital-acquired infections such as MRSA, the lack of time patients have to talk to their doctor, the fact that there are still very long waits for services such as psychotherapy, remain issues. GPs are under pressure not to refer patients to hospital for financial reasons. Many doctors, like managers, feel battered by the constant changes and reforms. Jo Revill, Health Editor The economy The facts GDP is \u00a31.118 trillion, making the UK economy the fifth largest in the world. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.9 per cent this year. The interest rate is 5.25 per cent. It was 6 per cent when Labour was elected. Total increase in taxation: \u00a33,100 per household. Unemployment now at 1.7 million, down from 2m in 1997. Government debt has fallen from to 44 per cent of GDP to 36 per cent. Personal debt has ballooned, with the average household now owing 160 per cent of its disposable income. Total mortgage borrowing now: well over \u00a31 trillion. House prices have risen dramatically in the past decade, at an average rate of 11 per cent a year. The analysis Even his harshest critics give Gordon Brown some credit for a decade of economic stability, with consistent growth, low inflation - at least until the past 12 months - and low unemployment. Setting the Bank of England free to control interest rates in 1997 is still widely regarded as the right decision, cementing the anti-inflation policies developed by Norman Lamont, and then Ken Clarke, after the debacle of Black Wednesday. There are some question marks over the future - particularly about the vulnerability of an economy in which debt has burst through \u00a31 trillion - but even if the borrowing bubble bursts, Brown will have got out in time. Where he is more vulnerable is on tax-and-spend. He stuck to the Tories&apos; tight plans for two years; then let rip with rapid spending growth, favouring health and education, and transferring resources to the poorest families through tax credits. Boxed into leaving income tax rates unchanged by Labour&apos;s election promises, he raised the extra cash by increasing national insurance rates and using fiscal drag - leaving tax thresholds unchanged so that more people pay higher rates. That approach has left the Treasury vulnerable to the charge of &apos;stealth tax&apos; and enraged business leaders who claim competitiveness is threatened. &apos;There are two really big achievements: one is the Monetary Policy Committee; and the second is keeping us out of the euro,&apos; says Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte and Touche. &apos;On fiscal policy, it&apos;s an improvement on the regime that went before, but it&apos;s not great. It&apos;s possible we&apos;ll see the ill effects from the Brown years in 10 or 15 years time.&apos; Brown has probably pushed the tax burden to the maximum the electorate will accept. Now, with little room for manoeuvre under his self-imposed &apos;fiscal rules&apos;, he is putting the thumb-screws on the rest of Whitehall.  Heather Stewart, Economics Correspondent Education The facts Government spending per pupil has doubled, from \u00a32,500 in 1997 to over \u00a35,000. More than 36,000 teachers and 154,000 support staff added to school payrolls. One in six secondaries are underperforming according to the Public Accounts Committee. 79 per cent of 11-year-olds meet required standards in English, up from 65 per cent; and 76 per cent in maths, up from 60 per cent. 58 per cent of GCSE candidates are getting five passes (C or better), up from 45 per cent in 1997. 46 of Blair&apos;s flagship academy schools have been opened. A third of secondary pupils played truant in 2006. Registered childcare places have doubled (now 1.28 million). 43 per cent of 18-to-30-year-olds now go to university. The analysis Blair came to power pledging to focus on education, education, education. He has done so and, to the frustration of more than a few backbenchers, has retained a zeal to reform the state sector. His abiding aim has been to place league-table and exam pressure on schools and give parents a genuine &apos;choice&apos; to abandon underperforming ones. The main practical benefits have come at primary and university levels. The government has missed some of its own targets (maths for 11-year-olds and the number of state-school applicants entering top universities, for instance). But even Blair&apos;s most churlish critics have to concede he has made a real difference. (Downing Street took particular glee at recent figures for overall university applications, which put paid to warnings that top-up tuition fees would drive people away.) But the main downside has come at secondary level, where the gains recorded in the GCSE tables mask deep, continuing problems. At least 500 of a total of nearly 4,000 state secondary schools are underperforming. A recent Commons report said nearly a million pupils are losing out as a result. The result, particularly in the most deprived areas, has been to limit the degree of genuine choice which parents have for their kids&apos; critically important secondary-school years. With Blair&apos;s academy programme still unproven, and opposed by a sizeable group of Labour backbenchers, there has been a continuing trend among parents who can afford it to exercise &apos;postcode choice&apos; - buying a home within the catchment area of a strong secondary - or going private. Many boys and girls are still opting out of school after 16, but the government rejected a radical overhaul proposed by former schools chief inspector Mike Tomlinson three years ago under which the GCSE/A-level system would be phased out in favour of a diploma. Ned Temko Home office The facts Crime has fallen by 35 per cent since 1997, with particularly steep falls in burglaries (55 per cent) and car crime (51 per cent). There is a mixed picture on violent crime - one of the two sources used by government, the British Crime Survey, which includes both reported and unreported crimes, claims a 34 per cent fall, but the &apos;police recorded crime&apos; figures show more than a threefold overall rise in violent crime. Prison numbers are at a record 80,000. The backlog of asylum applications is down from nearly 60,000 to 6,000. At the end of last month John Reid confirmed the splitting up of the Home Office. Two new units to be created: Security and Counter-Terrorism and Research, Information and Communication. The analysis Few issues matter more to Tony Blair than law and order. Few of his soundbites have had such lasting resonance as &apos;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&apos;, in his maiden conference speech as shadow Home Office spokesman in 1992. It&apos;s an area where he can claim a measure of success. Not only is crime down overall, but his &apos;respect&apos; campaign, with its 10,000 Asbos and 300,000 spot fines, while it may have been derided in the press, has also transformed the lives of many vulnerable, often elderly people in some of the country&apos;s most deprived areas. Still, Blair&apos;s instinct to be tough on crime has sometimes outweighed the &apos;tough on the causes&apos; bit. A spate of recent teenage gun and knife murders has been a stark reminder that new police powers and longer sentences cannot be the whole answer. The Home Office&apos;s own recent cock-ups, from forgetting to deport foreign prisoners to giving passports to convicted terrorists, have not helped either. But many of those problems had been building up long before Blair. A more serious cloud over his home affairs legacy has been his temptation to play populist politics with complex issues such as sentencing (potshots at unpopularly lenient terms), asylum (reluctance to face down tabloid scares about Britain being &apos;swamped&apos; by bogus applicants) and the Human Rights Act (which was introduced with justifiable fanfare by Blair early in his premiership). There is one area where Blair&apos;s toughness has backfired. Britain&apos;s jails are bursting. But two-thirds of inmates reoffend after getting out. Inside, most prisoners have some form of mental health problem, while staff typically lack either the time or the training to provide meaningful treatment. Ned Temko Foreign affairs The facts Government spending on foreign aid and development grants has doubled since 1997, increasing to 0.48 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, or around \u00a35bn. Tony Blair also used the UK&apos;s presidency of the G8 in 2005 to push forward a plan to write off the debts of the world&apos;s poorest countries. In the past 10 years Britain has intervened in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Sierra Leone. Defence spending has remained more or less level at about 2.5 per cent of total government spending since 1997. The number of British soldiers killed in Iraq is 134. The number of Iraqis reported as dead ranges from 64,000 on website iraqbodycount.org to 655,000 according to a survey published by the Lancet. The analysis Twelve days after the 1997 election victory, Robin Cook, then Foreign Secretary, invited journalists to the Foreign Office where, with a flashy video presentation, the new government&apos;s new foreign policy was launched - and the key word was &apos;ethical&apos;. Human rights would be respected and commercial interests protected. It was a policy to hamstring Britain, the world&apos;s fourth biggest arms exporter with 150,000 jobs in the industry. The manufacture of landmines was quickly banned and human rights principles were enmeshed into military training schemes. But scandals emerged - no more Hawk jets to Indonesia but licences for spare parts for ones delivered earlier; controversy over the government&apos;s dropping of fraud investigations into BAE Systems&apos; deals with Saudi Arabia; a \u00a328m military air traffic control deal with heavily indebted Tanzania pushed through in 2001 against opposition - the deal is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. But the government has achieved success in Africa, securing a debt relief programme for the poorest nations and a doubling of aid by $25bn a year. Blair can also claim much of the credit for Libya&apos;s 2003 decision to give up its programmes for weapons of mass destruction. For a country described by Dean Acheson as having lost an empire and not yet found a role, the eternal quandary for UK governments has been over which sea to face - towards our trading partners in Europe or towards the might of America. In his first term Blair managed the balance well. He had a good relationship with Clinton and proved himself a confident European. But Iraq changed everything and with no exit yet in sight, it is Blair&apos;s unfinished legacy. Tracy McVeigh, Foreign Editor Environment, food and rural affairs The facts Six million livestock slaughtered in attempt to control rampant foot and mouth disease (2001). Commercial GM crops on hold after mixed results (2004). Chief scientific adviser Sir David King says climate change is an even bigger threat than international terrorism. Britain&apos;s leadership of G8 puts international action to tackle climate change at top of the agenda (2005). Despite pledges to cut greenhouse gases, emissions have risen in 5 of the 10 years since Labour came to power. After another rise in 2006, carbon emissions are now 2.2 per cent higher than in 1997 - just a quarter of the way towards Britain&apos;s Kyoto promise to cut emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 to 2010. The analysis The failure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the biggest source of pollution, must dominate any assessment of the government&apos;s environment record. Worryingly, at the same time the most powerful indicator of the environmental health of the nation - biodiversity - has declined, weakening the country&apos;s capacity to cope with global warming. Britain has played an important international leadership role on climate change, particularly when it chaired the G8 group of leading nations in 2005. UK research has influenced thinking throughout the world and The Stern Report on the economics of climate change is considered an admirable wake-up call. However, carbon dioxide emissions have risen since 1997. This is a failure of the regime but ultimately it reflects worst on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which appears to have been powerless to galvanise other departments into action. Clean energy has been stymied by planning hold-ups and the energy review botched; road transport has been allowed to grow and grow; consumers are confused by contradictory policies such as allowing fuel taxes to fall in real terms. Ministers often failed to show personal leadership - notably Tony Blair, who declared he would not give up long-distance holidays despite the pollution they cause. Interested parties offer a mixed assessment of the government record. &apos;Sure, there have been some successes,&apos; says Dr Mark Avery, conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. &apos;There&apos;s better wildlife legislation, a ban on the trade in wild birds and initial, tentative agricultural reform.&apos; But he is less impressed by &apos;unsustainable farming, increasing water use, housing pressure, lack of protection for marine wildlife and over-fishing, which are all eating away at UK wildlife.&apos; Juliette Jowit, Environment Editor Work and pensions The facts Spending on child-related benefits increased by 53 per cent in real terms between 1999 and 2003. 700,000 children have been lifted out of poverty - with a target to eradicate child poverty by 2020. The number of people claiming incapacity benefit has increased from 2.3 million in 1997 to 2.7m. The proportion of lone mothers in work has risen from 45 per cent to 56.5 per cent. An ageing population has led to measures to increase the state pension age for men and women, which will increase to 66 in 2024, 67 in 2034 and 68 by 2044. Thousands of the UK&apos;s biggest companies have axed final salary pensions for their employees since 1997. But top executive pay has gone through the roof. The analysis Reforming the welfare state has been one of the quiet successes of the Blair years. Despite well-publicised technical hitches, tax credits have helped to sharpen up the advantages of work and redistribute cash to the poorest in society. A series of targeted New Deal schemes for various groups, beginning with the young, and extending to single mothers and the over-50s, has given an extra push to employment growth - though a strong economy has also helped. There have been radical changes on the redistribution front, but they have been introduced without fanfare. &apos;The only reason people would doubt the radical nature of what has happened over the past 10 years is that they haven&apos;t talked about it, because redistribution is controversial,&apos; says Kate Stanley, head of social policy at the Institute for Public Policy Research. Bundling benefits and pensions policy together, by rebranding the Department for Social Security as the Department for Work and Pensions, in 2001, was symbolic of the Blair-Brown approach of promoting work as the best route out of poverty. While unemployment has fallen, Labour has been criticised for neglecting the more than two million people claiming incapacity benefit, many of whom suffer mental illnesses and receive little assistance. A shake-up has now belatedly been proposed, but there is little new funding for radical change. On pensions, there has been less action. Means-tested help has been targeted at the poorest old people but apart from abolishing tax relief on share dividends for pension schemes, the government largely ignored retirement policy, until pressure to defuse the demographic timebomb forced it to agree last year to proposals to restore the link between the state pension and earnings. Heather Stewart, Economics Correspondent Defence The facts Government spending on defence is \u00a332bn now compared to \u00a321.46bn in 1997. Even such an increase may not be enough - the twin challenges of Iraq and Afghanistan will cost \u00a31.4bn alone this year: that is more than \u00a33.8m a day. The government&apos;s defence budget has remained steady at around 2.5 per cent of the GDP, which is twice as high as that of Germany. The number of personnel in the armed forces has remained broadly static over the past decade, hovering between 197,000 and 205,000 throughout Blair&apos;s stewardship. But numbers in training have risen by 15 per cent over the past 18 months and the size of the regular armed forces stands at 96.6 per cent of capacity. The analysis Few would disagree that Tony Blair appears to have developed a taste for war. And war is not cheap. Under Blair, Britain has witnessed the longest period of sustained growth in defence spending for more than 20 years. At great cost, both financially and politically, the offensive against Islamic terrorism has dictated defence strategy for the latter half of his premiership. Only an interventionist policy can, Blair believes, defeat global terrorism. Over the past five years an additional \u00a36.6bn has been required from the Treasury reserve to meet the costs of operations. Under Blair, British troops have endured their most difficult and intractable fighting since the Second World War. More than 180 UK troops have died in operations. At the moment Britain has 13,000 troops in two contentious conflicts. In Afghanistan, Nato&apos;s lacklustre support has meant Britain&apos;s armed forces will carry the burden of fighting a resurgent Taliban later this spring amid sniping from critics that the mission is poorly defined and open-ended. Yet it is Iraq, perhaps more than any other issue, that is likely to define Blair&apos;s decade. Success again, remains ill-defined and increasingly elusive. Iraq continues to flirt with civil war against a backdrop of sectarian killings. Blair admits the British public is &apos;unnerved by the absence of victory&apos; in its traditional guise. Yet his exit strategy from Iraq remains opaque and controversial. So, too, the thinking behind one of Blair&apos;s last defence decisions - that of paving the way for a replacement for the Trident nuclear weapons system. But the one question that most will ask of Blair is whether his stance on the war on terror has made Britain a less safe place. Mark Townsend, Defence Correspondent Transport The facts Fatal rail crashes at Southall, Ladbroke Grove and Hatfield between 1998 and 2001 led to a lack of confidence in public transport. A 10-year plan promised \u00a3180bn of public and private investment in roads and public transport. In 2000 Britain was brought to a standstill by blockades at fuel depots. In 2001 privatised national rail network operator Railtrack collapsed when the government withdrew funding. In 2003 London Mayor Ken Livingstone introduced an ambitious congestion charging scheme. In 2007, nearly two million people signed an online petition against national road tolls. The 2007 Cumbria derailment was the first crash that killed a passenger to be blamed on the railway industry for five years. The analysis It is little wonder the transport desk is one of the least comfortable positions in government. If train or bus passenger numbers fall, critics blame delays and exorbitant prices; if they rise, opponents shout about overcrowding. If you build roads, environmentalists squeal; if you try to reduce traffic, motorists rebel. This partly explains why the Department for Transport seems to have talked about revolutions and published glossy documents while presiding over a decade of almost no effective action. &apos;Road congestion is an increasing millstone around the country&apos;s neck, costing the economy \u00a315bn every a year. Government has been too slow to look seriously at congestion charging,&apos; says Alan Stilwell, chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers&apos; transport board. &apos;The good news is roads are getting safer and they are on target for a 40 per cent reduction in deaths and serious injuries by 2010.&apos; During this time, &apos;traffic&apos; has risen by more than 50bn kilometres of distance travelled on Britain&apos;s roads and coloured maps show congestion hotspots spreading and deepening. Meanwhile, more train passengers and fewer delays have brought chronic crowding and rocketing fares and subsidies. &apos;The increase in rail passengers is welcome, as is the prospect of road pricing - provided it is used to combat climate change,&apos; says Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth. Bus use has fallen outside a few urban areas. And many are furious about proposed national road charges. Belatedly, plans to manage roads better, for higher standards of road-building, and to improve much of the country&apos;s train track and carriages, are coming to fruition, and government has taken a bold lead on road pricing. But with more than 90 per cent of travel still being on the roads, congestion is the most important measure of success or failure - and drivers all over the country, at all times of day, know it has got a lot worse. Juliette Jowit, Transport Editor Trade and industry The facts The introduction of the minimum wage ensured better rights for workers. 6,000 people lost their jobs after Rover went bust weeks before the 2005 election. Jobs declined across the motor industry - in 1997 there were 234,200 jobs, by 2006, 175,000. Manufacturing jobs followed the same path - in 1997, there were 4.5 million jobs and by 2006 3.2 million. Productivity, however, rose as companies invested in machines. The &apos;productivity&apos; gap with the US, Germany and France narrowed. Britain attracted increasing inward investment from \u00a3153bn in 1997 to \u00a3483bn in 2006. The increased science budget and encouragement for research and development has also been welcomed by business. The analysis Labour has not been interventionist enough for many of its supporters, more interventionist than it should have been to some friends in the centre and critics on the right. So, while Patricia Hewitt did not step in to rescue Rover when it went bust in 2005, Stephen Byers had done all he could behind the scenes five years earlier to make sure the company was kept as a volume car-maker in the hands of John Towers and his &apos;Phoenix Four&apos;. Industrial unions such as Amicus and the Transport and General Workers&apos; have criticised the government for not protecting well-paid manufacturing jobs and employers have joined in condemnation of the fall in job numbers. But manufacturers also point out that productivity has risen as businesses have invested in capital and that national employment remains close to full. Indeed, the first point most businessmen make in assessing Labour&apos;s decade in power is about the strength of the economy and the depoliticisation of interest-rate decision making. The first-term &apos;fairness at work&apos; measures - the national minimum wage, legal recognition for trade unions for the first time, signing the European social chapter - were welcomed by the TUC. Unions have been less enamoured of progress since 2001. The work agenda picked up again only in 2005, with mixed results. The UK continues to attract increased investment from overseas, both directly in projects and indirectly through investment in companies, indicating that returns delivered by UK plc remain competitive. On energy, Labour took nine years to decide what to do. In 2003 it ducked the issue of building new nuclear stations, focusing instead on renewable energy. It is unlikely, however, that renewables will reach the target of 10 per cent of energy supply by 2010. Labour has given nuclear the go-ahead to prevent reliance on gas from unstable places like Russia and Iran. Oliver Morgan, Industrial Editor Culture and sport The facts Spending on the arts has more than doubled since 1997 from \u00a3186m to \u00a3412m. Attendance at museums and galleries has risen by 83 per cent. Extra money was invested in regional theatres, with audiences up 8 per cent. Labour has increased public funding for sport, from both the Exchequer and the National Lottery, from \u00a3222m to \u00a3580m a year. In 2001 just 2 million pupils did the recommended minimum of 2 hours of PE a week; last year it was 5 million. 97 per cent of schools now hold a competitive sports day. More than 3,000 new community sports coaches have been hired. Britain has risen from 36th in the medals table at the 1996 Olympics to 10th in Athens in 2004. The analysis After the initial song and dance about Cool Britannia in 1997, Blair and his ministers have kept their distance from speaking on all things artistic. Tessa Jowell&apos;s reign, as a result, is far more associated with the other elements of her brief. Last month saw a break in tradition when Blair suddenly hailed a cultural renaissance or &apos;Golden Age&apos; of the arts in Britain. He also promised there would be &apos;no return to boom and bust&apos; in funding, although there is still nervousness about the impact on grants of the impending Comprehensive Spending Review. The re-direction of Lottery funds towards the Olympic treasure chest is creating real fear inside many of our cultural institutions. It would be churlish not to acknowledge Labour&apos;s achievements in sport. Investment is at a record high. Action to revitalise school sport is, at last, increasing the amount of PE pupils do; however, the epidemic of childhood obesity means much more needs to be done. Amateur sports clubs have benefited from getting 80 per cent mandatory rate relief, while the Football Foundation and Supporters Direct now exist to help the game&apos;s grassroots and supporters respectively. Plus, without the Prime Minister&apos;s 48 hours of personal diplomacy among International Olympic Committee members in Singapore in July 2005, London may well not have pipped Paris in the race for 2012. Lottery funding has allowed elite athletes to dedicate themselves to sport and thus win medals at the Olympics and world championships. But Labour has been accused of hypocrisy by first cutting sport&apos;s share of lottery proceeds from 20 per cent to 16.6 per cent and, more recently, raiding \u00a31.45bn of Lotto money to help meet the spiralling cost of 2012. So progress, happily, but much more for the football and rugby-loving Gordon Brown to do.

Many are believed to have been illegally allocated in 2002 by a transition government emerging from a decade of civil wars and are in defiance of a World Bank moratorium.

To gain access to the forests for the next 25 years, the European companies have made agreements with village chiefs, offering bags of salt, machetes and bicycles, and in some cases promised to build rudimentary schools, the report states.

Like many green leafy vegetables they have suffered the curse of overcooking in school dinners but, even if you have bad memories, please give them another chance. They are sweet, crunchy and if all you can be bothered to do is steam them, they still taste delicious. Of course, that would mean that you&apos;d need enough restraint to actually cook them and not nibble them raw, which is very tempting. Spring greens are also packed with vitamins C, E and K, iron, potassium, fibre and calcium. One quick tip: don&apos;t discard the stems - just slice them more thinly than the green parts, they are actually sweeter than the leaf. So, here are three ways to get creative with your spring greens - from a five-minutes-from-fridge-to-plate creation from Riverford, to a much more lavish creation from the wonderful Paradiso Seasons by Dennis Cotter (of Cork&apos;s Cafe Paradiso).   Only have five minutes? Spring Greens with garlic and soy sauce  Riverford Serves 4 2 small heads of spring greens 2-4 table spoons sunflower oil 2 cloves garlic soy sauce Chop two whole greens cross-ways into strips of 1cm or less. Chop almost down to the stump. The stems and leaf ribs are the sweetest bits. Heat the oil in a wok or heavy bottomed pan over a high heat. Peel and lightly crush the garlic with the back of a knife. Keeping the cloves whole will avoid burning. Cook in the oil for just about 20 seconds and add the greens before the garlic browns. Cook for about 2 minutes turning constantly in the oil. Add two or three shakes of soy sauce, cook for a further 15 seconds and serve. Half an hour to spare? Coconut sambal  Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall  Serves 4   100g fresh coconut  60g baby spinach leaves, young kale or spring greens, washed and coarse stalks removed  \u00bd-1 fresh hot red chilli, deseeded, finely chopped  Lemon or lime juice  Salt and pepper   A sambal is a chilli-hot relish found in the cooking of Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, and served in small amounts alongside other dishes. This is a very simple, very delicious, very refreshing example. It&apos;s essential to cut everything finely, so take your time. This one makes a great accompaniment to veg curry, but is also delicious with grilled fish or even roast chicken or lamb.   Grate the coconut on a medium grater. Roll the spinach into tight, cigar-like wads and slice into very fine ribbons. Combine the coconut, spinach and chilli with a good squeeze of lemon juice, some salt and pepper. Leave for about 15 minutes for the flavours to mingle, then toss again.   All the time in the world? Braised spring cabbage and tomato pesto rolls From Paradiso Seasons by Dennis Cotter  Serves 4   2 tablespoons pinenuts  3 tablespoons thick tomato pesto (see below)  1 head spring cabbage olive oil  200-300mils vegetable stock  To make the pesto:   100g of sundried tomatoes  2 cloves garlic 300mls olive oil  Salt and pepper, to season  Soak the sundried tomatoes for 20 minutes in enough warm water to cover them. Puree them in a food processor with the garlic, then pour in the olive oil, with the motor running, until you get a thick but pourable consistency. Season with salt and pepper.   To make the rolls:   Lightly toast the pinenuts in a heavy pan over low heat, or on a tray in the oven, until very lightly coloured. Tip them on a chopping board and chop them roughly with a knife, then stir them into the tomato pesto.   Cut the base off the cabbage and separate the leaves. Bring a pot of water to the boil, drop in the leaves, giving the dark outer ones a head start of a minute or two, and cook them until tender, about six to eight minutes. Remove the leaves to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking while preserving their lovely colour. Lay the leaves flat on a work surface and spread a thin layer of the pinenuts in pesto on each one. Fold a third of a large leaf over on itself, then fold again. Starting at a short end, roll the leaf reasonably tightly but not so the pesto squirts out. You should have something that resembles a green cigar stub.  Repeat this with the rest of the leaves, bearing in mind that smaller leaves will possibly just take on initial fold. Cut the larger stubs in half but leave the smaller ones - an inch is a nice size. Place them in a small oven dish, brush them generously with a good olive oil and spoon over enough stock to just cover the bottom of the dish. Place the dish in a moderate oven, about 180\u00b0c/ 350\u00b0f, for 12-15 minutes. Ideally the oils from the brushing and the pesto will have mingled perfectly with the stock to give a sweet rich gravy to serve the rolls in.

Despite publicly supporting the need to make the IMF more representative of the new global economy, sources said London and Paris were strongly opposing a blueprint for reform. Under plans backed by the US, either Britain or France could be replaced by China as one of the five most powerful countries at the fund and the influence they have wielded for more than 60 years would be diluted. Only Britain, France the US, Germany and Japan have the right to appoint their own executive director to the IMF&apos;s board. The other 19 directors have to represent countries that do not have their own board member. Under new proposals, however, the size of a country&apos;s economy - the basis for voting rights at the fund - would be adjusted by purchasing power parities (PPP), a device that adjusts GDP to take account of prices around the world. Since a pound buys more in China or India than it does in London or Paris, the result would be to increase the size of the economies of poorer countries. Ranjit Banerjee, India&apos;s policy adviser at the IMF, said Britain and France had discovered they had the most to lose by the plan to apportion voting rights on the basis of adjusted GDP. &quot;The UK and France realised that they would get hit the most,&quot; Mr Banerjee said. &quot;Under the proposed reform they could see China overtaking them in terms of the size of its economy&quot;. He said Britain and France had voiced objections to using PPPs to assess the size of economies at two recent meetings - one in Washington and one in London - and had persuaded other European countries to support the blocking strategy. The UK and France are proposing that the pecking order at the fund remain unchanged and that reform be phased in slowly. Mr Banerjee said the leading developing countries were prepared to compromise provided Europe accept a &quot;modicum of PPP&quot; in the new voting formula. &quot;We are open to compromise, but the spirit of compromise on the part of the Europeans is slowly drying up. Reciprocity is not there on the part of the major European players, which is disturbing. As things stand, the UK and France are trying to block reform. &quot;France won&apos;t accept a lower quota than the UK. Who will be fifth; it&apos;s very contentious.&quot; The British Treasury was dismissive of the idea that the IMF balance of power should be based on whether a haircut cost more in Washington than in London. A spokesman said: &quot;We are fully committed to reform of the quota system in line with the agreement in Singapore. Reform should properly reflect countries&apos; actual weight in the world economy. We have concerns about a formula based on PPPs given that the fund is a financial institution that operates on actual exchange rates where countries contribute and borrow from the fund on that basis.&quot; Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF&apos;s managing director, said yesterday that it was understandable countries should have their own positions on reform of the institution and that he hoped there would be consensus on the way forward by the time of the fund&apos;s annual meeting in October. Peter Chowla, a policy officer at the Bretton Woods Project thinktank that specialises in the fund and the World Bank, said: &quot;We find it disappointing that despite the rhetoric about increasing the shares of developing and low income countries, the British government seems opposed to any moves that would bring about a change in voting rights at the fund.&quot; &quot;What the IMF really needs is a complete governance reform that fundamentally changes the power structure.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/apr/15/healthandwellbeing.features3", "sentences": ["Two to get me from Sydney to Singapore, two more to see me back home to London.", "The very fact that this means I am going to have to walk through Singapore&apos;s Changi Airport with two grams of a Class A drug in the back pocket of my shorts is the least of my worries right now."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-14T23:14:22Z", "title": "Danny Wilson on life in the Priory", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Culture"], "article": "January 2006Sydney, Australia I have only been living in Sydney for three weeks, and John is already one of my best friends ever. He is the reason I have not yet been anywhere near any of the lovely beaches, checked out the Opera House, or even gone for a stroll across the Harbour Bridge. He is there for me 24/7. John is my drug dealer. I need a drug dealer because I am now officially a drug addict, working my way through between four to eight grams of cocaine a day every day - anywhere between 60 to 120 lines per day, or \u00a3200-\u00a3400 a day in real money - and have been doing so for the last four years. And I need a drug dealer in Sydney because this is where I have been posted by my employers, partly because I can still just about function and do a half-decent job for them, partly because my wife has made it very clear that I am no longer welcome in the family home, and partly because I have begged to be sent here because I believe with all my heart that if only I can get a long way away from London then I might just be able to stop taking drugs. That particular notion lasted precisely three days. By day four I was going up the walls and suddenly it seemed that a quick line - just the one and then I&apos;m back on the wagon - would be the perfect way to pep up a Saturday night. Obviously, inevitably, unavoidably, that one line became the usual four grammes and we are off again and running. Within a week, I am back where I was when I left London after Christmas, thanks to making the acquaintance of John and his massive medicine cabinet. Still, at least now I know for sure: my name is Danny, and I am an addict. And I desperately need some help... March 2006Sydney-London It is on my 15th visit to the toilet at the front of the business-class cabin when the duty officer finally cracks a knowing grin and enquires if sir is suffering from an especially weak bladder. Yes, sir is indeed suffering from precisely that, what with the two excellent bottles of Penfolds already horsed down before even leaving Australian airspace, not to mention the three or four massive jugs of port that have just accompanied the onboard selection of cheeses. In itself, this amount of drink at this sort of altitude would not be a great idea. The bigger problem here, however, and the real reason behind sir&apos;s seemingly endless forays to the lavatory, is that sir has already hoovered up the guts of a gram of cocaine, the first of four to see me through the 23-hour flight back to London. I have it all worked out. Two to get me from Sydney to Singapore, two more to see me back home to London. The very fact that this means I am going to have to walk through Singapore&apos;s Changi Airport with two grams of a Class A drug in the back pocket of my shorts is the least of my worries right now. I am, by now, beyond caring about such apparent trifles as a lengthy spell in a foreign prison. Instead, what I am caring an awful lot about - what I am caring about so much that I have to keep doing line after line just to keep the rising panic at bay - is that once these four little wraps run out, that&apos;s my lot. As in no more ever again. As in end of. As in what is waiting for me at Heathrow when I arrive is a big blacked-out people carrier, there to meet me, greet me, and whisk me all the way to the Priory. I still cannot believe that I have finally made the decision to throw in the towel. To come clean, to break down in front of my employers. To tell them that I have a massive problem with drink and drugs, and that no matter how much I want to stop, how hard I have been trying every day for more than a year to stop, I just can&apos;t. And finally I say to them what I have been saying to myself over and over again every night for the last 18 months. My name is Danny, and I am an addict, and I desperately need some help. In an act of extreme kindness that begins to restore my faith in human nature, they immediately arrange for me to be flown straight back to London for what they assure me will be a seven-day fast-track quick-fix programme of recovery. I will later find out that no such programme exists, and that they have wisely concluded that the idea of spending the recommended 28 days inside would have driven me straight back into the arms of my welcoming dealer. I am met at Heathrow and whisked across town, through Richmond Park, and down the hill to the Priory. With the in-flight booze and cocaine raging around my system, I am convinced that we have arrived at a five-star hotel, an impression confirmed by the presence of men in uniform who even go to the trouble of unpacking my bags for me. This place is good. They won&apos;t even let you unpack. It is a few days later when I am told that this is otherwise known as Searching For Drugs. Thankfully, they don&apos;t find any, because obviously I have consumed every last white speck either on the plane or on the week-long binge that preceded it. Right now, I am starting to fade, and I just want to sleep for ever. I lie down, stare at the ceiling of room 15 in the Priory Hospital, Roehampton, and I close my eyes... Easter 2005London I am in my basement in London, eight grams in a big bag next to me, hardcore pornography flickering on the TV, wife and kids thankfully away for the Easter weekend. I have been married to Jane for 15 years, and have two children, Jack, 12, and Molly, just eight years old. I love them all with all my heart, but right now I love cocaine just that little bit more. Somehow, somewhere in the last five years, what had begun with the occasional recreational line just to pep up the spirits, make it a proper night out for God&apos;s sake, has turned into a full-blown have-to-have it habit. I have now gone through the three classic stages of developing an addiction - this is fun, this is getting out of hand, this is fucking killing me and I can&apos;t stop - and I am starting to mess up on a regular basis both at home and at work. Thankfully, I still have just enough sense left in me to try to keep it away from the kids. Jane, though, became aware of the situation maybe a year back - it would have been hard not to when your husband simply stops coming home of an evening - and has pleaded with me to get help. I will do, darling. Just not today. My employers, whom I have been with now for more than 10 years, would also quite like me to stop, what with me no longer showing up on a regular basis. When I am there though, the drugs, unlike the drink, are harder to detect than you may imagine. It is like I am just a little bit out of it all the time, just a little bit gone, rather than the rip-roaring chaos that would accompany an afternoon on the piss. However, my immediate boss has already asked me how bad a habit I have. Not do I have a habit. Or am I possibly developing a habit. No, the question they asked was: how bad a habit do I have. I lie, as I now lie to everyone about pretty much everything, and we tentatively agree that it might make sense sometime soon to follow up on that conversation re: a temporary posting to Sydney. Good. If only I can get away from London, away from the stresses of life with the wife and the kids and the job, if only I can do all that, then surely to God I can get back to normal and get off the gear for good. But before then, before I really do stop I promise, before all that, I just need one more line. One more gram. One more ounce. One more one more one more... Day 1, 3amThe Priory I come round from my final transatlantic binge sometime in the early hours of Monday morning. I do not recognise this room. I am clearly no longer in my apartment in Sydney. But nor do I seem to be in my lovely old family house in west London. Instead, I appear to be in what looks like a private hospital bedroom. This latter impression is confirmed by the fact that there is a nurse standing over me, gently asking me if I need any medication to help me get back to sleep. She has been able to walk into my room because there is no lock on the door and there is no lock on the door in case I try to harm myself during the night. I ask her one or two questions and she gently provides the answers. I am in the west wing of the Priory Hospital in Roehampton. The west wing houses those patients who, like me, are on the Addiction Therapy Programme. It is 3am on Monday morning and I have been out cold since I was poured in here straight off the flight on Saturday afternoon. I have slept for 36 hours. And I need to get back to sleep now because in just five hours&apos; time I will have to be up and ready for the start of my programme. I thank her and tell her I will try to roll over and get some sleep. And I do try. I try to close my eyes and blot it all out. I try not to keep reaching out over the side of my bed to find the drugs that are no longer there. I try not to think of Jane or Jack or Molly, safely tucked up just a few miles across town. And I try not to think of Aussie John or London Trev, my personal doctors, either of whom could so easily take away this pain, this awful guilt, this unbearable shame. I am 45 years old, a husband, father, and drug addict. Somehow, I have ended up in a psychiatric hospital, a long way away from the people and places I love. I start to cry, great heaving sobs, crying for myself, crying for my children, crying for my wife, crying to be fixed, crying to be anywhere other than here in the west wing of the Priory... Day 1, 8amThe Priory The night nurse comes back in for a final check on me around 8am. I have been wide awake now for five hours and am already starting to become all-too familiar with my immediate surroundings. In my room, I have my bed, two chairs, a desk, a portable TV, and a bathroom. Contrary to the popular perception of the Priory being some sort of five-star hotel, the sleeping accommodation at least is more akin to a standard provincial B&amp;B. Each of the 20 or so rooms leads out on to a corridor, at the end of which, just to remind you one more time that you are currently residing in a psychiatric hospital, is a nursing station. We live and sleep on the first floor of the west wing of the main Priory Hospital, the magnificent white building so familiar from the tabloid front pages of recent years. The business end of the operation, however, is tucked away in a corner on the far side of the grounds, in a small unprepossessing two-storey house known as Priory Lodge. Every morning, following reveille and a quick breakfast in the hospital canteen, I walk across the grounds to the Lodge just in time for the official beginning of the day, the 15-minute group meditation kicking off at 9am. One of our group does a reading, and we are then encouraged to sit and stare straight ahead of us, blocking out all conscious thoughts, just staring and breathing as best we can. For the first few days, I can barely manage two minutes without having to get up and go outside for a cigarette, thoughts and guilt and shame and remorse crashing in on me from all sides. It is after this morning ritual, however, when the real work begins. This, the very centrepiece of the Priory programme, is the group therapy session running for nearly 90 minutes every single day, weekends included. It is in these sessions that I start to meet the other members of my group; and it is in these sessions that what I now know to call my ongoing recovery starts to take shape. In our particular group of 15 alcoholics and addicts we have just one celebrity. The rest of us are a pretty accurate cross-section of Britain, among our ranks being a journalist, a builder, a barrister, a farmer, an estate agent, housewife, a property developer, a yummy mummy, a pilot (thankfully now long retired), a couple of self-employed businessmen, a hairdresser, and, of course, a handful of folk working in IT. We are addicted to cocaine, heroin, sex, skunk, pills, or shopping. Right now I feel I have nothing in common with them bar our one big common problem. Within just four weeks, they will be like family to me, and - both in the group therapy sessions by day and in the communal lounge area at night - I will be telling them the stuff of my nightmares... February 2005London I am in a hotel somewhere in London. I have come here in the dead of the night because I cannot bear anyone I know to see me like this. Just nine hours ago, around 6pm, I had popped out for a quick pint. That had turned into three, which had obviously turned into the nightly phone call to Trev to get himself round here asap and serve up the necessary. I buy the usual four grams from him just in case I might want some later in the week as tonight I am going to have just a few cheeky lines and be done with it. Somehow, in the next couple of hours, I work my way relentlessly through two whole grams and the nightmare is off and running. By the time I get to the hotel, I am convinced I am being followed and that the entire eyes of the night staff are upon me. I barricade myself in the room, unwrap the final pair, and get stuck in. I need help. I want more coke. I want help. I need more coke. Wanttostopcantstophelpme... Day 7The Priory I have been here a week now and the good news is that I am starting to look and feel physically better than I have done for years. The bad news is that I can&apos;t stop crying. Sometimes it is a particularly sad story retold by another member of the group that sets me off. Sometimes it is merely the sight of a squirrel running across the lawn outside. Often it can just be the silence, seemingly endless, that can grip the group in the first few minutes of the daily therapy session. Each session kicks off in the same way every day. We are split into two groups, one in each room with two members of staff, almost all themselves recovering alcoholics and addicts as well as qualified counsellors. We go around the room introducing ourselves - I&apos;m Danny, I&apos;m an alcoholic and cocaine addict - and are then asked to describe how we are feeling right here and right now. Not how we are thinking or how we were feeling last night or what we may have got up to when off our heads three weeks ago, but how we are feeling right here right now. As in happy, sad, angry, bored, horny, frustrated, guilty, suicidal, sometimes all of the above. It is here, in these daily sessions, where the essence of the Priory programme comes to life. Without ever being spelt out in any great detail, what gradually becomes apparent is that the more we can be made to feel and get in touch with these feelings and emotions, then the more likely it is that we can start to deal with them in a constructive manner, rather than trying, as of old, to block them out with a bottle of vodka or a bag of coke. Certainly, by the end of my own active addiction, I did not want to feel anything, and would use even the merest hint of an emotion - be it a brief glimpse of happiness or the vague enveloping sense of doom - as an excuse to use. Now, sitting in this room in Priory Lodge, talking with fellow war veterans, I can pinpoint my feelings, talk about them for the first time in years, scream and shout if that&apos;s what I need to do, and gradually begin the process of healing. The other central belief at the heart of the programme - and the one that makes me break down and cry when first expressed to me by a member of staff - is that we are not sinners who are here to somehow miraculously turn into saints in just four weeks&apos; time, but sick people who need to get well. And who have every chance of getting well if we can simply follow this programme while we are here, then take on a few other suggestions for life outside the Priory walls. The most important of these takes the form of an introduction to the various 12-step fellowships open to anyone seeking recovery, the best-known of which are, of course, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and, in my particular case, Cocaine Anonymous (CA). We are introduced to these fellowships via visiting speakers who come in to tell us their own stories, and the occasional visit outside the walls to the nearest local branch of whichever group it is you most need to go to. For me, these trips back out into the real world are hard. Every Friday night we are taken in the so-called druggy buggy to the Fulham meeting of Cocaine Anonymous. It starts at 7pm, which means that the route there and back is seemingly lined with social drinkers and recreational drug users all having a perfectly pleasant beginning to their weekends. Not for me, and not for my fellow group members on the bus. We are whisked in and out, back home by 9pm to the big white building in Roehampton, ready for another long and painful weekend in recovery... September 2005London This fine autumn weekend I am meant to be away on a short family visit to Paris, a chance to show the kids the sights, maybe even take them up the Eiffel Tower if there&apos;s time. Either way, little Jack and Molly are going to have to do it all without Dad, because Dad isn&apos;t with them. Because Dad has failed to make the train one more time, because Dad has been up for three nights on the trot, because Dad is desperate to never ever come down. My wife Jane, now driven beyond the point of caring by way too many examples of such behaviour, instantly sees the all too familiar signs of yet another no-show, sweeps the children up and away, off to Paris without me. I get straight on the phone to Trev, order up another four, and settle in for a long weekend with only my best mate Charlie for company. For the first few hours, I am flying high, not a care in the world, downing the vodka, snorting the coke. The porn gets more intense, the rush almost unbearable, the desire to never come down forcing me to take more and more. Somewhere, though, deep in my core, in what is left of the old me, the old loving father and husband, I know that this is all wrong. It is utterly unforgivable. That I am going to kill myself, if I do not stop this madness. The problem is that I can&apos;t. I want to stop and I can&apos;t. I want to stop and I can&apos;t. I want to... Day 10The Priory On my first day here someone told me that at some point I would be asked to write my life story, then read it aloud to the group. Today is the day when I am going to stand up in front of my 15 fellow travellers on this extraordinary journey and tell them the truth. Bits have already leaked out in the daily group therapy sessions, over a meal in the canteen, sitting chatting in the communal lounge at night. This though is the real thing, the one that has to begin with the day I was born and finish with the last drink and the last line on that long flight back home from Sydney. I am nearly halfway through the 28-day programme and already that old world seems a long way away. I have wept every day, but I have also started to laugh again for the first time in years. I no longer feel that I need four large drinks and six fat lines of Charlie to make me at one with the world. I have started to feel the first rumblings of what the Priory staff and the people at AA and CA refer to as a spiritual awakening, my own version of which is that I am beginning to think of people other than me, and of things other than drink and drugs. Even with these encouraging early signs of recovery, though, I know that today is going to be difficult. I stand up in front of them, Bill, John, the other Danny, Susan my fellow cokehead, Phil, Linda, these people I had never met just two weeks ago, and I start to tell them my story. The years of wanting to block the world out with drink, then drugs, the good times, the awful times, and finally the worst of times, the times when I tried to stop, wanted with all my will to stop, only to find, to my terror, that I couldn&apos;t. And how now, through this programme, with their help, with the visits to the fellowships, and with surrendering to a will greater than my own - call it God, call it Buddha, call it Jane or Jack or Molly - I am starting to slowly turn the corner. I break down many times as I tell them all this, tell them stuff I have never told anyone before or since. And by the end, on day 10 of my four-week stay in the Priory, I finally feel that I might just have a chance of once again being able to breathe, to live, and to love... Day 15The Priory Along with my life story, I have one other piece of written work to present to the group before my 28 days are up. This is a written Step One, the introductory and essential beginning to the 12-step programme which underpins the entire process of recovery. In order to do this, I have to write down and read aloud 10 examples of how I had become utterly powerless over my addiction and how my life had become completely unmanageable. Let me count the ways. I would drive my car while off my head. With my children strapped into the back seat. I would go for days without washing or even brushing my teeth. I would not eat while on a drink and drug binge, then gorge myself to try to alleviate the horrors of the comedown. I would lie about everything to everyone. I would spend \u00a3200 a day in order to render myself senseless. And every day I would wake up so determined to never do that again. And every day, just 30 minutes later, I would be on the phone to Trev or to John, begging them to bring it on just more time. As I read my Step One aloud to the group, the full horror of what I have done and the damage I have caused becomes all too apparent, and I can barely talk or breathe, or make any kind of sense out of what has happened to me. At the end, the group come forward, one by one, and hug me and hold me close. And finally I am gone, my defences utterly smashed, a 45-year-old man broken into pieces, standing here in the Priory and weeping for the havoc he has wreaked, the people he has hurt, and all that he has lost... October 2005London Even in my drug-addled stupor, I realised that not only was I slowly killing myself with my addiction, I was quickly snorting my way through the guts of my entire salary, the hefty overdraft facility set up in happier times, and the entire family savings. This was the money we had both worked so hard to put a way for some far-off rainy day. Now it was pouring out of me at an average of \u00a3200 a day, or \u00a31,500 a week, or \u00a36,000 a month, or a staggering \u00a372,000 a year. Every year for nearly five years - over \u00a3300,000 in total. This was money we did not have, and money I am paying back to this day, and will be doing so for a long time to come. The shame of seeing good old Trev driving around in his nice new car at the same time as Jane found herself unable to do the weekly shop - &apos;it must be those wankers at the bank, darling&apos; - haunts me still. Day 20The Priory The days since telling my life story have passed in what is by now the familiar routine of daily life inside the Priory walls: breakfast, meditation, group therapy, life story, lunch. Then the afternoon sessions of perhaps some 12-step work, a talk from a visiting ex-patient, a trip out to a CA meeting, a spot of yoga, or, my own personal unlikely favourite, a one-hour session of group movement therapy. Somewhere between dance and mime, these sessions take place in a large barn at the edge of the main building, and involve the group acting out a number of feelings to the accompaniment of music and instructions from our resident coach. Yes, I know it all sounds a bit daft and New Age Gone Mad. Today though, as I start my final week and have my farewell session in the barn, it all seems to make perfect sense. The group are asked to express in dance how they feel about me as a group member as I prepare to take my leave of them. As one, they form a circle around me, hands reaching out towards me, keeping me safe from my demons, while bidding me a fond farewell. I look up to try to say thank you and goodbye to each and every one of them, but no words will come out, and I can see nothing but tears. By now, nearing the end of my stay, I have had two visits from my wife, Jane. I had made contact with her through the hospital authorities in my first week here simply to let her know that I am here and that I am trying to get myself well again. Not surprisingly, she is deeply sceptical of such promises, having heard them all just one too many times before. At the end of my first fortnight inside, however, she finally agrees to come and see me. I can see her still, one year on, as she pulls up in the car and waves over to me. She gets out and walks across the car park towards me. I run towards her and bury myself in her arms, my silent sobs taking the place of the script I had carefully prepared for this moment. Over the course of this visit and her second trip a week later, we agree that I will move into a rented apartment on my own when I get out of here. That I will attend AA, NA, and CA on a daily basis. That I will get to see Molly and Jack at weekends for as long I stay clean and sober. And that I will not see any of them again if I ever go back out there, back out there into the madness... Day 26The Priory Two days to go, and as one of the veterans of the party by this stage, I have been elected group leader. This involves little more than welcoming newcomers and making sure that everyone is on board the druggy buggy in good time, but right now it means the world to me. In years gone by, I have been appointed to various bodies and been promoted many times at work, but that was all before the slow inexorable decline into alcohol and cocaine addiction, and in turn, the inability to ever be anywhere near the right place at the right time. Now, at last, a group of people - and I don&apos;t care that they happen to be a bunch of slowly recovering drunks and junkies - have decided that I can be trusted to show up again. These final few days as leader pass quietly enough, bar the thrilling rumour that sweeps the camp to the effect that a major-league pop star is due to join us any day now. As group leader, I will have to meet and greet one of my teenage idols, take him to his room, and, best of all, discipline him if and when he is late for class. Luckily, for both of us, he never shows up. Disappointed at the time, I am glad now that he never made it through the door. I liked our group just the way it was. I liked the fact that we had just the one celebrity among our team of civilians. And I liked the fact that now, our 28 days nearly up, we were about to head back out there into the real world, bound for ever with our memories of the Priory and our pledges to stay in touch and to never ever go back out there again... Easter 2007London It didn&apos;t quite work out like that of course. Of the 15 people in my group at the Priory, I have not heard from a third of them since the day I walked back out through reception. They may be well, they may be back drinking and drugging, and I pray for the former while fearing the worst. Another five have been what is known in AA parlance as in-and-out, making their own way through the revolving doors of the fellowships and recovery a few months and weeks at a time. And a final third, a hardcore five, have, to the best of my knowledge, stayed clean and sober since the day we left, though if my own experience is anything to go by, it will not have been an easy road to travel. Some days I look back at my four weeks in the Priory and wonder why it is that we all haven&apos;t made it through to the other side. On other days I am frankly amazed that I have made it this far without having to have a drink and a drug. Before I went in there, after all, I could not get through a single morning without one or the other. To last more than 365 days without either is a miracle, though one in which I claim little or no part. I have simply done what was suggested to me in Roehampton and in the various church hall fellowship meetings I have been to in the 12 months since leaving. Namely, to get myself a sponsor (someone who is successfully working a 12-step programme and who has got some clean time under his belt), to work the 12 steps on a daily basis, and to get myself to meetings as often as I can. And to not pick up a drink or a drug, just for today. Tomorrow? I might well get wasted. Today, though, today I&apos;ll pass, thanks. Now, more than a year on, I am back at home, back with Jane and Jack and Molly, back trying to make the most of it second time around. I am only too aware that I can never fully make up for the harm I caused to them and to myself and to everyone around me in the years of my active alcoholism and addiction. All I can do, therefore, is what I am told to do at every meeting I go to, which is to lead this new life of recovery one day at a time, to never go back out there, and to practise the 12 steps in everything I do. Perhaps, one day in the future, the scars will heal, but for now just to be here is so much more than enough. And now, when I tell people about my time in the Priory, they invariably ask me two questions. One is did I meet lots of celebrities. The second is do you think that I need to go there. To which the answers I give are no, and it&apos;s not really for me to say. All I know is that if you ever find yourself drinking and/or taking drugs and not being able to stop, no matter how hard you try, no matter how hideous the consequences for you and the people around you, then you could do a lot worse than think about a brief spell in one of the many Priories or similar private and NHS treatment centres dotted around the UK. You probably won&apos;t get to meet Kate Moss. But it might just save your life. &amp;#183 Danny Wilson works in publishing and is a recovering alcoholic and cocaine addict.

Flying into Washington for the bank&apos;s spring meetings, Benn said the furore over the special treatment given to Wolfowitz&apos;s partner, Shaha Riza, &apos;has damaged the bank, and should never have happened&apos;. With development ministers due to meet today, Benn&apos;s intervention - which was cleared with the Chancellor, who is also in Washington - echoed criticisms of the embattled neo-con already made by France and Germany. Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, said the bank &apos;must have irreproachable ethics,&apos; and Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, the German development minister, said: &apos;He has to decide for himself whether... he can credibly fulfil his duties.&apos; Riza was seconded from the bank to the US State Department when Wolfowitz was appointed in 2005 to avoid any potential conflict of interest, but he intervened to insist on a series of pay rises for her, boosting her salary to a tax-free $193,950, and guaranteed promotion if she returned to the bank. The World Bank&apos;s staff association and anti-poverty campaigners - already furious at what they see as the politicisation of the institution - have called on Wolfowitz to resign, and members of staff held a protest yesterday afternoon. Liz Stuart of Oxfam said Wolfowitz had lost the confidence of his staff, and that the affair was damaging the credibility of the institution. Amy Gray of Action Aid said: &apos;The World Bank is losing face. If it wants its policies on corruption to be taken seriously, it must first look within. The board must act quickly to restore confidence.&apos; After a series of leaks from disgruntled insiders, the bank&apos;s board, which is examining the matter, released more than 100 pages of documents this weekend, including a statement from Riza in which she complains bitterly about her treatment. &apos;I have now been victimised for agreeing to an arrangement that I have objected to and that I did not believe from the outset was in my best interest,&apos; she said. The board has promised to issue a verdict &apos;expeditiously&apos;. Benn said that the investigation should be allowed to run its course, but the concerted interventions of European ministers will inevitably be seen as an attempt to force Wolfowitz to consider his position. Benn said: &apos;Having published the facts, the board has yet to complete its work. We should respect the process. I&apos;m sure these views will be shared by other governors, who will also be considering their responses. This weekend was meant to be about the bank&apos;s contribution to fighting poverty.&apos; Wolfowitz has already been forced to issue a humiliating apology for his actions last week, saying: &apos;I made a mistake, for which I am sorry. Not only was this a painful personal dilemma, but I also had to deal with it when I was new to this institution.&apos; Since the scandal erupted, President George Bush has issued a series of votes of confidence in Wolfowitz, whom he appointed to the World Bank two years ago. But without the support of the Europeans, his position may prove to be untenable. Bush&apos;s decision to appoint his close confidant as head of the anti-poverty organisation provoked angry reaction in European capitals, and many donor countries have been increasingly concerned about the direction the bank has taken. Benn himself held back \u00a350m of Britain&apos;s contribution to the bank&apos;s funds at its annual meetings in Singapore last autumn in a row over Wolfowitz&apos;s anti-corruption drive."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/16/retail.food", "sentences": ["Started in 2000 when Australian mother of three Janine Allis had tired of looking for healthy, takeaway snacks for her young boys, Boost has expanded into Chile, Kuwait, Singapore and Indonesia."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-16T22:51:07Z", "title": "Smoothie invasion troops given dancing and juggling lessons", "tags": ["Business", "Retail industry", "Food & drink"], "article": "The booming smoothie market is facing a shake-up with the arrival of a rapidly expanding Australian juice chain. Boost Juice, the fastest growing smoothie business in the southern hemisphere, hopes to conquer Britain under the management of the team behind Millie&apos;s Cookies. Richard O&apos;Sullivan and Mario Budwig, who grew the cookies and muffins chain to more than 100 outlets across the country, are turning their attention to a healthier form of indulgence. Tapping into a growing thirst for healthy snacks, the UK&apos;s first Boost Juice opened in Manchester&apos;s Trafford Centre this weekend and will be followed by another outlet in Oxford later this week. Boost claims to be Australia&apos;s fastest growing retail chain and has been dubbed the Starbucks of the juice world, with more than 30 stores opening each year. Started in 2000 when Australian mother of three Janine Allis had tired of looking for healthy, takeaway snacks for her young boys, Boost has expanded into Chile, Kuwait, Singapore and Indonesia. It has four other countries on its radar for this year. In Britain it is being launched into a cut-throat market. Demand for fresh fruit drinks has expanded rapidly in recent years. The UK is already home to 24 multi-site businesses of various sizes. There is also a booming market for in-store smoothies such as Innocent. Mr O&apos;Sullivan, Boost&apos;s UK head, says he is undaunted by what he calls an &quot;absolutely saturated&quot; battleground. He said: &quot;Everybody is piling into the market and the rents are being driven sky-high. There&apos;ll be a consolidation. There are going to be casualties. There&apos;ll be a tipping point and that tipping point will be either an acquisition of a competitor or just becoming outright preferred brand by both the consumer and the landlord.&quot; Boost hopes to set itself apart from rival chains such as London-based Crussh with an Australian feel. The business has built its brand on an image of young staff who are encouraged to dance and juggle fruit. Mr O&apos;Sullivan spent six weeks working behind Boost bars in Australia with his wife and retail director Dawn. The couple have held auditions, rather than interviews, for new staff and the 20 people picked are at a pre-launch smoothie school. Mr O&apos;Sullivan, 44, and his business partners sold Millie&apos;s for a reported \u00a325m in 2003 and he stayed until the start of 2006, taking his time at the chain to just short of 20 years. He then became involved with Boost on the recommendation of his daughter, who was in Australia on a gap year. &quot;She phoned me and said there&apos;s a business here in Australia and it looks like something you&apos;ve done,&quot; he said. A trip to Australia and meetings with Boost&apos;s founders followed. &quot;I had a look at it and loved it,&quot; he says. &quot;The reason for taking Boost is really simple: they were going to come to Britain whether you like it or not.&quot; He plans three more bars in Manchester this year and is considering a range of venues from shopping centres to indoor ski slopes. &quot;Our first six to eight stores are all in different types of environments so we are taking it for a test drive,&quot; Mr O&apos;Sullivan said. &quot;If the brand is as popular as we think it will be, the potential is enormous.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/apr/18/travelnews.business.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["I am so pleased that we have won.&quot;  The awards started in 1982 and BA now ties with Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic in having won the top prize five times."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-18T10:00:18Z", "title": "BA voted airline of the year", "tags": ["Travel", "Business travel", "UK news", "Airline industry", "Business", "British Airways", "Air transport"], "article": "British Airways has shrugged off its recent difficulties to be named airline of the year for the first time in almost 20 years.

Last month figures showed that BA had lost more bags in 2006 than any other major European carrier.

Leading researchers expressed their dismay at the situation, claiming that the government inaction has stifled the development of treatments, and jeopardises Britain&apos;s position at the vanguard of the field. In January, five groups of researchers wrote to Gordon Brown requesting his direct intervention to resolve the impasse, but they have received no response. Many scientists believe research on stem cells will lead to unprecedented insights into some of the most debilitating conditions, including spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&apos;s and Alzheimer&apos;s. But before stem cell-based therapies can be tested in humans, they must be approved to guarantee they are safe. The vast majority of stem cells created by researchers cannot be used in clinical trials because they are grown in animal serum and kept alive on layers of animal cells. Contact with the animal products raises a risk of the cells becoming contaminated with viruses or proteins which could cause diseases or trigger an immune reaction if implanted in a patient. The risk of contamination means that even if scientists using the cells succeed in developing a potential cure for disease, much of the work would have to be repeated with &quot;clean&quot; stem cells before it could be safely tested in humans. Scientists across the country have spent at least \u00a320m building clean laboratories to create and store safe stem cells. As yet, none of the facilities are operating because of the government&apos;s failure to decide which agency should accredit them. The specialised laboratories have been built, or are due to be built, at King&apos;s College London and the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle. The UK stem cell bank, which stores cells from around the world, has also built a dedicated facility for clinical grade cells, but cannot get accredited. Researchers claim the responsibility for approving the sites falls to one of two regulators, either the Human Tissue Authority (HTA), or the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), but each claims the task is beyond its remit. &quot;Neither of these think it&apos;s their job, so it&apos;s a pingpong that&apos;s been going back and forth between the two,&quot; said Michael Whitaker, a signatory of the letter to Mr Brown and dean of development at Newcastle University. The criticisms emerged at the launch yesterday of a new initiative called the UK national stem cell network, which seeks to promote the science.

This has been corrected.  Professor Robert Roaf, who has died aged 93, was one of the world&apos;s leading spinal surgeons and one of the last of the British pre-war Himalayan climbers. He came from a family of academics; his Canadian father was professor of physiology at Liverpool University. Having spent his early childhood in London, he won a scholarship to Winchester College at the age of 13 and received a further scholarship in 1931 to Balliol College, Oxford, to study physiology and biochemistry. Wanting to be different from his family he decided against becoming an academic despite taking first-class honours. In 1934 Roaf&apos;s parents moved from London to Liverpool where he finished his studies. In 1935 he was delegated to a medical conference in the Soviet Union. Just before departing he was invited by Marco Pallis, mystic and mountaineer, whom he had met by chance two years earlier, to join his next Himalayan expedition as medical officer. After returning from the USSR and undertaking mountaineering training on ice and snow in Switzerland, Roaf set out for India and Sikkim in 1936 with the Pallis expedition. Although the climbers failed to reach the summits of Simvu at 22,360ft or Siniolchu at 22,620ft (both, incidentally, climbed later that year by a Bavarian team), both Sikkim and, later, Ladakh, impressed Roaf deeply. He developed a lifelong interest in Buddhism, oriental arts and a deep love of the Himalayas. Back in England, Roaf became a Quaker in 1939 and registered as a conscientious objector, but soon had the feeling that pacifism had no answer to Hitler&apos;s aggression and joined the Merchant Navy on convoys as ship&apos;s surgeon. He was invalided home at the end of 1943 and worked the last two war years in an emergency hospital in Winwick, near Warrington. Wanting to specialise, he took a degree in orthopaedic surgery at Liverpool in 1946 and was appointed assistant surgeon at Liverpool Royal Infirmary. His next appointment, in 1947, was to the Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry. Here, when treating a 14-year-old patient with a severe scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine) who had had the conventional treatment of posterior bone fusion six years earlier, Roaf had a revelation that this method was completely wrong and, after much detailed research with colleagues, he developed a new method of operating through the chest to correct such spinal deformities from the front. After much resistance, his method became accepted worldwide as standard procedure. Years later he commented: &quot;Heretics, especially in medicine, are never welcome.&quot; As part of the Colombo Plan, in 1952, Roaf successfully started a post-graduate training programme at the Irwin Hospital, Delhi, India, and visited many parts of the country to lecture, advise and operate. He made many lifelong friends and deepened his interest and knowledge of Indian arts and culture. Returning home in 1955, Roaf was appointed director of clinical studies and research at Oswestry and, starting from 1960, he was invited by the British Council to visit, lecture and treat patients in Japan, Thailand, Burma, Brazil, Cuba (which most impressed him with its excellent medical service), Egypt, India, Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, the US and the USSR, all of which he found to be very educational and a constant source of humorous anecdotes. One was of a leading Burmese chief and politician who, years earlier, had been badly injured in an air crash. &quot;He had deformed feet, un-united fractures, unreduced dislocated shoulder - there was no end to his complaints and miseries. After 15 minutes I could stand no more of his ever louder wailing. &apos;Tell me,&apos; I said, &apos;If I could cure just one complaint which would it be?&apos; For the first time he smiled. &apos;Oh, Sir, I would be eternally grateful to you ... if only you could cure my impotence!&apos; he replied. My incompetence was made clear. To all.&quot; Another recollection was of 1970s Iraq, when, lecturing at Basra University he noticed: &quot;In the street, female students were dressed head to foot in black shrouds. As they entered the campus, like butterflies emerging from a chrysalis they threw off their gowns to emerge in full feminine glory - high heels, mini skirts, low cleavage, see-through blouses, elaborate hairstyles, make-up and jewellery galore. They were as flirtatious as their western sisters. At five o&apos;clock like Persephone returning to Hades in the autumn, they put on their shrouds and went home.&quot; In 1963, fate made him an academic after all, when, aged 50, he was appointed chair of orthopaedic surgery at Liverpool University. He was to represent the university at the General Medical Council, was appointed pro vice-chancellor and chairman of the staff-student committee at the height of the 1960s student troubles, always continuing his work at Oswestry. He retired from official posts in 1976 and after a six months&apos; teaching tour of Malaysia, retired to Chester. He continued visiting the Himalayas until he was 85, often to visit Tibetan refugee settlements. In 2003 he was delighted to receive researchers from the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, Sikkim, who interviewed him about his experiences in 1936. Roaf remained a keen observer of the medical landscape in Britain. Writing in the Guardian in April 2002, he commented that hospitals were now: &quot;Infinitely better than before the NHS came into being in 1948. Among many improvements are better diagnostic facilities and equipment, better drugs, improved surgical techniques, better liaison with GPs and better aftercare.&quot; Roaf&apos;s main publications include Scoliosis (1966), Posture (1977) and Spinal Deformities (1980). With Leonard Hodkinson he co-wrote Textbook of Orthopaedic Nursing (1971) and The Paralysed Patient (1977). In addition, he edited and contributed to various works on orthopaedic mechanics, including Implants in Surgery, and patented a spinal implant. Of his travels, he contributed a paper, Ladakh in 1936, to the International Colloquia on Ladakh (1995) and a piece, Sikkim in 1936, to the Alpine Journal (2001). He was recognised by many honorary fellowships and memberships of medical associations worldwide. Despite the high esteem in which he was always held by the medical profession, he remained an exceedingly modest man who declined official honours. His wife of 67 years, Ceinwen, predeceased him, aged 94, by a week. They are survived by two sons and two daughters. \u00b7 Robert Roaf, orthopaedic surgeon, climber and traveller, born April 25 1913; died February 16 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/apr/22/houseprices.property", "sentences": ["&apos;It speaks the new universal language of English, has an easy air hub at Heathrow, good schools, a welcoming tax regime for foreign owners, and the world&apos;s financial capital in the City.&apos; In the past year Peerless has visited Singapore, Dubai, the US and (three times) Shanghai, to explain London&apos;s property market to wealthy would-be buyers.", "&apos;The number of high net-worth individuals (HNWIs) is expanding more rapidly in North America than in Europe for the first time since 2001, while Singapore, South Africa, Hong Kong, India and Australia have seen the highest growth in HNWI numbers,&apos; explains Liam Bailey of Knight Frank, an estate agent that at any one time has about 300 of London&apos;s most expensive homes on its sales books."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-22T09:10:09Z", "title": "Billionaires in battle to buy London's best homes", "tags": ["Money", "House prices", "Property"], "article": "It could be the stuff of World War III: Arabs, Americans and Russians trying to outfox each other and seize control of valuable land. A new terror crisis? A stormy session of the United Nations? No: this is a typical scene from central London&apos;s super-wealthy and overheated housing market, where the rich and famous compete for the rarest of commodities - a perfect property in a prime location. The whole of the London property market may be hot at the moment, with the average asking price nearly \u00a3379,000, according to property website Rightmove, but central west London - from Kensington and Holland Park in the west, through Bayswater to the north of Hyde Park, past the mews of Mayfair and Knightsbridge and down to Belgravia and Chelsea in the south - is at melting point. According to Rightmove, in Kensington and Chelsea average property prices have soared by \u00a3120,000 to \u00a31,329,878 in the past month and by \u00a3620,000 in a year. There are two reasons for this extraordinary increase: the first is pure economics: there are far more wealthy buyers than there are homes for sale. The second is status: when the world&apos;s wealthiest buyers want to add another prestigious address to their real estate portfolio, they look to Pimlico rather than Paris, to Marylebone instead of Manhattan. &apos;London has what the world&apos;s richest people want - security,&apos; says Charles Peerless of Winkworth estate agents. &apos;It speaks the new universal language of English, has an easy air hub at Heathrow, good schools, a welcoming tax regime for foreign owners, and the world&apos;s financial capital in the City.&apos; In the past year Peerless has visited Singapore, Dubai, the US and (three times) Shanghai, to explain London&apos;s property market to wealthy would-be buyers. &apos;The number of high net-worth individuals (HNWIs) is expanding more rapidly in North America than in Europe for the first time since 2001, while Singapore, South Africa, Hong Kong, India and Australia have seen the highest growth in HNWI numbers,&apos; explains Liam Bailey of Knight Frank, an estate agent that at any one time has about 300 of London&apos;s most expensive homes on its sales books. Bailey says Britons now buy only half of the most expensive homes in prime central London, where apartments routinely cost over \u00a31m and houses usually over \u00a32.5m. That share drops to just 40 per cent of the &apos;super-top-end&apos; homes costing more than \u00a34m. The surge in overseas interest means central London&apos;s market is the hottest in the country and now operates to totally different rules to those of other major cities in the UK. For one thing, foreign buyers don&apos;t have a home to sell in London, so they add to demand without helping to maintain supply. Therefore prices go up faster and competition intensifies. Another issue is safety. &apos;Security is key,&apos; says Peerless. &apos;Although fear of terrorism has eased, there&apos;s a lot of concern that any property lived in by a wealthy buyer&apos;s family must have the security associated with exclusive new developments in the very prime areas of London - CCTV, direct access from underground car parks to flats, and so on.&apos; The underlying economic attraction of London has rarely been stronger. City bonus payments this winter have hit \u00a38.8bn, of which about 60 per cent will be spent on property, mostly in London. Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy, says the City&apos;s financial institutions - where average annual pay is already over \u00a3120,000 - will add another 12,700 to their staff by late 2007. Over 65 per cent of Fortune&apos;s Global 500 companies, a key barometer of the world&apos;s financial operations, have chosen London as their European or world headquarters, and the capital has more foreign banks than any other city. So where does this leave British buyers in the capital? &apos;Wealthy Brits buy a small mews house or pied-a-terre in London, then have a main house or estate in the country,&apos; says Robert Bailey, who believe the summer will see another influx of foreign buyers just as domestic purchasers start their holidays. &apos;If Britons want a substantial house in the capital, they&apos;ll probably find themselves relegated to south London - Battersea, Wandsworth or Clapham,&apos; suggests Bailey. &apos;These are lovely houses, of course, but a little further away from the action in the centre. That&apos;s where the rest of the world is.&apos; Where the money is Belgravia Property: It doesn&apos;t get much grander than this - think big, then bigger again.

The result is four family-centred playlets that strain so hard to mean something, they only intermittently take on a life of their own. This is theatre as puzzle page, offering the intellectual challenge of figuring out the metaphors, but giving relatively little insight once you have done so.

She, we figure, is the angry Northern Irish unionist rejected by the birth mother of the UK and spurned by the adoptive parents of the Republic. It might have worked as comedy, but delivered straight, the metaphor is laboured and the performances stilted.

Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, yesterday unveiled plans for a congestion charge on cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. Compared with London&apos;s \u00a38, New York&apos;s proposed charge will be a snip at $8, around \u00a34 at today&apos;s exchange rates. The proposal was delivered in a speech to mark Earth Day. Pledging to make New York &quot;a brighter, healthier and more economically prosperous city&quot;, Mr Bloomberg couched the charge in terms of climate change. &quot;The science is there,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s time to stop debating it and start dealing with it.&quot; The initiative comes as Mr Bloomberg attempts to address what one report he commissioned declared was the growing cultural, financial and commercial dominance of London. New York&apos;s plans were introduced by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, who presented himself as an &quot;environmental warrior&quot;, a term he used to describe Mr Bloomberg. With the proposals, said Mr Schwarzenegger, &quot;New York leaps to the forefront of cities dedicated to attacking climate change and protecting our environment&quot;. The announcement came with a video endorsement from Tony Blair. &quot;Your announcement will mark out New York as a global leader in the fight against climate change,&quot; he said, describing it as &quot;a great act of leadership&quot;. Mr Bloomberg&apos;s plans include measures to encourage home building, plant 250,000 trees in the city, invest in public transport and reduce air pollution. The proposals, known as PlaNYC, are expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. Mr Bloomberg, in the final three years of his administration, is seeking to cement his legacy by positioning New York City at the forefront of civic environmentalism. Opponents, though, say the billionaire mayor is penalising the city&apos;s poor by introducing a regressive tax. &quot;This is another tax for New York City folks,&quot; Walter McCaffrey, a lobbyist with Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free, a group representing local business and labour groups, told the New York Times. &quot;If you&apos;re riding in a limo you can afford it. But this city is also made up of working-class people who would be hurt by it.&quot; In comments before his speech, Mr Bloomberg did not shy away from the suggestion that the charge was a tax, a position generally shunned in American politics. &quot;Using economics to influence public behaviour is something this country is built on, it&apos;s called capitalism,&quot; he said in his weekly radio address. He went on to outline subsidies to accompany the proposed charge, as well as pledging to spend the expected $400m it raises each year on public transport. In 1987, then New York mayor Ed Koch proposed a $10 fee to drive into Manhattan, but withdrew the plan amid opposition from business leaders. Five years ago, in the wake of 9/11, Mr Bloomberg proposed new tolls for road bridges to Manhattan to raise money for mass transport. Those proposals too were withdrawn. Now the mayor&apos;s camp has judged that the political climate is more sympathetic to charging. On Monday the Partnership for New York City, a prominent business group, will announce its support for the charge. The proposal comes as the city faces population growth of 1 million over the next 20 years. Mr Bloomberg aims to encourage the building of 250,000 new homes with the introduction of tax incentives and new planning regulations. The C zone London moved to congestion charging in February 2003. The zone was extended into west London and doubled in size last month. Observers will be keen to see what kind of system Mayor Bloomberg seeks to implement. The London scheme, which relies on cameras and the identification of vehicles through their number plates, relies on old technology. Any renewal of congestion charging in London is likely to feature modern satellite tracking. A major issue will be the impact of the charge on business. Ken Livingstone has been forced to defend his charge amid recurring complaints from shops, restaurants and theatres that the charge damages trade. Cities like Olso and Singapore already use congestion charging.Hugh Muir"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/apr/24/whydidpaperpullstoryonmu", "sentences": ["One pointer: he lives in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-24T06:35:28Z", "title": "Why did paper pull story on Murdoch's wife?", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news"], "article": "The Sydney Morning Herald got cold feet about running a story on Rupert Murdoch&apos;s third wife, Wendi Deng?

Gim was born into a well known and distinguished Buddhist family in Singapore, the 19th child in a family of 26. Her father was a self-made man, a highly successful building contractor, and her mother, his fifth of six simultaneous wives, was originally a slave girl from Henghua in mainland China. It was another age: as a child, Gim narrowly escaped having her feet bound, a practice banned by the British around the time of her birth. Her father and mother died when she was a small girl and life thereafter was almost completely lacking in love. At 17, she was removed (under protest) from school, married to her first husband, and had three children in the next few years. These were hard times; the young family lived through the Japanese occupation, which haunted Gim in her dreams to the end of her life. One of her brothers, Lim Bo Seng, a nationally celebrated hero of the resistance against the Japanese, died under torture, and the rest of the family endured privation and hardship. After the war, her marriage broke down (her Buddhist husband wished to take a concubine, which Gim, as a Christian, refused to countenance) and it was then that she showed signs of the toughness and resourcefulness she exhibited for the rest of her life. She taught herself to cook, type and drive (recklessly), and got a job as secretary to the Bishop of Singapore. During this time, Gim met a young English clergyman, Christopher Weston, who had come out to Singapore with his wife and son to be chaplain of St Andrew&apos;s School. After his wife&apos;s death from polio, Christopher and Gim were drawn together, and in 1959 Gim and her three children began a new life in England, where Christopher became chaplain of Cheltenham College. Her arrival into that staid world caused something of a stir; her first appearance in college for a Sunday service, the new wife of the chaplain dressed in her normal Sunday best: a cheongsam slit to the thigh on both sides. The boys of Cheltenham College must have been impressed with their chaplain&apos;s taste in women. In 1963, the family moved to Rotherham in Yorkshire, where Gim started her successful career as a vicar&apos;s wife. In assisting her husband in his work, both there and then in Stevenage, Christopher&apos;s next and last parish, Gim really found her vocation. Following their retirement, Gim and Christopher moved to Cherry Hinton, near Cambridge. There they had several very happy years, but sadly, Christopher was diagnosed with Parkinson&apos;s disease. Gim was never a stoic, and raged to the end against the sheer cruelty of what happened to her beloved husband, my father, who survives her along with the two sons and one daughter from her first marriage and one stepson and me."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/25/4", "sentences": ["Pret opened its first store in London in 1986 and has branches in Britain, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-24T23:03:43Z", "title": "Business news in brief", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "US business lifts Aviva first quarter sales by 16% Britain&apos;s largest insurer Aviva, which this week announced the departure of the head of its UK business, Patrick Snowball, has reported a 16% rise in life and pensions sales.

The dollar fell on the foreign exchanges after the figures were released as dealers anticipated the need for cuts in interest rates from the Federal Reserve to boost the housing market. Larry Elliott Top 25 hedge fund managers pull in \u00a37bn The top 25 hedge fund managers banked $14bn (\u00a37bn) last year, according to a survey in Alpha magazine. The average take was $570m, up 57% on 2005 and 127% on 2004. To qualify as a top 25 earner, a hedge fund manager would have to make $240m. The findings mirror that of a ranking produced by the magazine Trader Monthly two weeks ago . Alpha says the biggest money maker last year was James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, who made $1.7bn. Kenneth Griffin of Citadel Investment came second with $1.4bn and Edward Lampert of ESL Investments was third with $1.3bn. David Teather Whitbread looking to buy as pre-tax profits rise 25% Whitbread is keen to bolster its Premier Travel Inn budget hotel business with an acquisition but its chief executive, Alan Parker, would not comment on reports that it wants the \u00a3680m Jurys Inn chain. Whitbread unveiled strong results driven by Premier Travel Inns and Costa coffee shops. Underlying pre-tax profits rose 24.5% to \u00a3213m in the year to March. Sales rose 10.3% to \u00a31.3bn. Whitbread is in talks to sell its David Lloyd Leisure fitness clubs, which have been valued at \u00a31bn, after disposing of its 50% stake in Pizza Hut and TGI Friday last year. Its shares rose 19p to \u00a319.21 yesterday. Julia Kollewe Primark helps food group to 5% increase in profits Associated British Foods, which owns Primark, Silver Spoon sugar and Kingsmill bread, saw a 5% rise in half-year profits yesterday thanks to the discount clothing store&apos;s rapid expansion. The 166-strong Primark chain opened 23 new stores in the past six months, adding 84,000 sq metres (900,000 sq ft) of shop space. By March, all but four of the Littlewoods stores acquired by ABF in 2005 had been converted to Primark shops. The chain&apos;s popularity was seen recently when staff were injured in the rush of shoppers at the opening of its new Oxford Street store. The chain also has two stores in Spain.

From oil well measuring gauges to industrial food sterilisers, there is a long list of &quot;sources&quot; that could be used to construct a dirty bomb which, when detonated, would spread dangerous radioactive material over a wide area. In the US an average of 168 sources were lost and never recovered every year from 1996-2001. Europe lost 70 per year. Thousands are reported missing in the former Soviet Union. The world is literally littered with them. Of those missing in the US, 20% were classified as risky, meaning the radioisotope was of a type that could be used to make a dirty bomb. Deadly simulations In simulations of a dirty bomb attack, the death toll is usually about 100 people. Many die from the initial explosion, as well as the spread of the radioactive contaminant. Peter Zimmerman, former chief scientist at the US Arms Control Agency, says: &quot;You could make 10 times as many people sick as you would kill. The effects include loss of hair, bone marrow destruction and radiation burns that can be hard to heal.&quot; People would also experience vomiting and diarrhoea. &quot;All this could result from two shotgun pellets&apos; worth of material spread around a densely populated area,&quot; he says. The cleanup costs would run into hundreds of millions and some buildings might have to be torn down. But David McIntyre of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission says: &quot;To make a dirty bomb you have to be fairly sophisticated. When you extract the material you run the risk of exposure.&quot; Which means radioactivity detectors will spot them. To reduce the chances of a nuclear or radiological dirty bomb attack, the US is currently leading a colossal effort to install a network of preventative defences at home and abroad. Within the next year or two, every person and vehicle entering the US, EU and many other countries will have to go through a portal that scans them for radioactive materials. US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, while visiting ports in China and Singapore last year, said: &quot;The greatest threat we have to prevent is a nuclear device being detonated by a terrorist.&quot; His department has given radiation detectors to China and Singapore as part of what he described as a &quot;layered series of defences&quot;. Twenty-four hours before a container is embarked, the partner port must notify US Customs officials, who check it against a database. They can then request the container be scanned before it leaves. The DHS spent $500m (\u00a3250m) on the Megaports Initiative last year. Hundreds of detectors are now installed at ports in 30 countries in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Chertoff projected that by the end of 2006 the US would &quot;be putting two-thirds of containers through radiation portal monitors either overseas or in this country, and next year we will get close to 100%&quot;. The UK is installing its own detectors at ports and other border points. Neither the Home Office nor the Department of Transport would comment. Since 9/11, the US Government has installed over a thousand detectors inside its own country, but the technology has proved far from perfect. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported in 2005 that it was getting about 150 false alarms a day from its 22 radiation portals. The culprits range from contaminated scrap metal to bananas, which contain naturally radioactive elements. In Rotterdam, port guards are often alerted to radiation coming from broccoli trucks. Handheld scanners are then used to make sure more dangerous sources are not hidden inside. In March 2003 a bus travelling from New York to Atlantic City set off a detector installed in a tunnel. State Police pulled the bus over and discovered that one of the passengers had received a harmless 10 millicuries of iodine-131 earlier in the day as part of a medical procedure. Doctors advise patients having radiation therapy not to use airports for a few days afterwards but there are plenty of stories of people unwittingly setting off airport alarms. America is leading a global procurement drive for better detection equipment. The Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) is a yellow gateway fitted with gamma and neutron detectors that automatically differentiate between thousands of radiation sources. It contains a huge library of radioisotopes and will be connected to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission&apos;s National Source Tracking System, a &quot;cradle-to-the-grave database of licensed materials&quot;. The US Government plans to install portals on every major highway into New York. The ASP is currently in testing, but when ready will probably be the detector they use. Radiation portals Said Abousahl of the EC&apos;s Joint Research Commission coordinates nuclear safety projects. Part of his work involves the effort to secure radiological sources in Europe and neighbouring states. Another element is stopping a bomb being used. He says some European cities will soon be surrounded with radiation portals: &quot;Some member states are planning this, but which ones remains confidential.&quot; But experts say even the new generation of sensors will find it hard to detect the material used in the most dangerous threat: a portable nuclear bomb. Leonard Spector at the Center for Non Proliferation Studies says: &quot;Uranium-235 just doesn&apos;t give off much radiation.&quot; Even the ASP won&apos;t be able to detect uranium. The IAEA reports 16 confirmed cases of illegal trafficking in highly-enriched uranium over the past decade. Cases involving material that could be used to build a dirty bomb run into hundreds. In 2004, former US Defence Secretary William Perry said there was a 50-50 chance of a terrorist nuclear detonation occurring before 2010. Zimmerman says: &quot;That is unlikely. I would estimate a 1% chance per year.&quot; On the possibility of a dirty bomb, he says: &quot;I&apos;m surprised it hasn&apos;t happened already. We&apos;ve been lucky.&quot; \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/26/unfairtrade", "sentences": ["The EU is aggressively pushing the so-called Singapore issues [pdf]; these include investment, competition policy and public procurement, even though these have already been rejected by developing countries at the World Trade Organisation talks because they would inflict lasting damage on poor communities and their environment."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-26T15:00:00Z", "title": "Unfair trade", "tags": ["European Union", "Economics", "World news", "Labour", "North Korea", "India", "US news", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "During the course of this month civil society organisations and social movements worldwide are holding actions against unfair trade deals that the European Union is forcing on 76 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, of which 39 are among the least developed in the world. These so called Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) [pdf] are comprehensive free trade instruments that are set to force ACP countries to eliminate trade barriers to almost all EU imports. This will expose family farmers and fledgling industry to direct and unfair competition from powerful European corporations - driving farmers off their land and causing mass unemployment. The EU claims that these deals are pro-development but even the European commission&apos;s own impact assessment [pdf] has highlighted that they could lead to the collapse of West Africa&apos;s manufacturing sector. Yet it is the agricultural sector that is set to suffer the most as the current proposals will fling open markets - mainly throughout sub-Saharan Africa - and pave the way for the dumping of cheap, subsidised European goods such as cereals, processed meat and canned vegetables. This threatens the livelihoods of millions of farmers who simply cannot compete with cheap imports. Many ACP countries have indicated that they are not ready to sign such agreements. African civil society has been calling on their leaders to walk away from the negotiating table. However, the European Union is threatening to reinstate higher duties on ACP exports and to reduce aid if they do not sign EPAs before the end-of-year deadline. Friends of the Earth, civil society organisations and social movements from around the world have issued a declaration condemning the use of such bullying tactics against some of the world&apos;s poorest countries. We are equally concerned about other ongoing and upcoming bilateral and regional trade deals that the EU is gearing up to impose on other developing countries. EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, presented a new aggressive trade policy which was laid out in the strategy communication: Global Europe - Competing in the World [pdf] in October last year. This strategy will see the proliferation of EU bilateral trade negotiations with South Korea, Asean (10 South-East Asia countries), India, Central America and the Andean community which are to be added to the existing EU negotiations with the ACP, the Gulf states and Mercosur (Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela, Argentina). These negotiations signal a significant shift in world economic relations and will certainly lead to resistance to EU policies on a global scale. Mandelson&apos;s new vision is explicitly about serving the interests of European corporations, offering them new markets, access to natural resources and energy reserves. This is being pursued at the expense of developing countries&apos; national policy space, livelihoods and their environmental and social protection. The EU is aggressively pushing the so-called Singapore issues [pdf]; these include investment, competition policy and public procurement, even though these have already been rejected by developing countries at the World Trade Organisation talks because they would inflict lasting damage on poor communities and their environment. This is the same agenda being pushed via a different route, one whereby countries can be picked off one by one. New investment rules in particular would open up and deregulate oil, mining, forestry and fishery sectors on behalf of European transnational corporations. This would undermine poor communities&apos; access to the natural resources that fishing communities, farmers and indigenous peoples - in particular women - rely on for their livelihoods, medicines, fuel and food security needs. These unjust policies are being carried out on behalf of the UK and other EU member states when what we desperately need is an alternative approach to trade that is better for people and planet. Our campaigning [pdf] in Europe is in support of grassroots movements fighting for a better world, and is, for example, in solidarity with the millions of producers campaigning for food sovereignty. We urge the governments of the ACP to heed the calls of its civil society to resist these proposals. In Europe, we urgently need to mobilise to prevent the signing of Economic Partnership Agreements and other EU corporate trade deals. It is disgraceful that UK ministers claim to promote sustainable development while being part of the push to get developing countries to sign away their livelihoods and environment. The British government is a key player within the EU and should use its full influence to stop these deals from going ahead and to get Mandelson&apos;s offensive strategy scrapped. Anything less is a betrayal of communities throughout the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/28/world.travel", "sentences": ["From there, the microlight crossed the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Singapore and the island of East Timor before a long sea crossing to Darwin, then down the east coast of Australia to Sydney."], "publicationDate": "2007-04-27T23:13:25Z", "title": "Smelling the ground and feeling the clouds, blind pilot closes on record", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Travel"], "article": "When flying a microlight halfway round the world there is much to contend with. Thermal blasts that toss the craft around the sky like a toy; snow flurries and frigid altitudes that cut through protective clothing; the bureaucracy of refuelling in difficult parts of the world. All challenging enough if you&apos;re at the peak of your powers. But doubly so if, like Miles Hilton-Barber, you are blind. The Briton is on the last leg of an epic seven-week, 13,000-mile adventure. He has endured violent turbulence, freezing temperatures and fierce headwinds in a tiny aircraft exposed to the elements with the aim of becoming the first blind person to fly a microlight from Britain to Australia. He is due to complete the journey by piloting the plane into Sydney on Monday morning. &quot;I&apos;ve been thrown around the sky in the most frightening way and the cold has been beyond description at times but I feel jubilant that I&apos;m nearly there,&quot; he said, speaking from a motel room in Queensland on the last leg of his voyage. The 58-year-old has flown across 19 countries with the aid of speech-controlled navigational equipment developed by a British company which reads altitude, speed and headings to him and helps him steer his course. He responds by typing flight coordinates into a keyboard strapped to his leg. &quot;I use all the knobs and switches as well, just like other pilots,&quot; he added. The microlight has a 100hp engine that allows it to cruise at 70 knots and it also has a long-range 160-litre fuel tank sufficient for flights of up to 10 hours. A co-pilot - microlight champion Richard Meredith-Hardy - has accompanied the blind pilot, but he only takes over in emergency. &quot;Flying like this is a very sensual experience because, although I can see only light and darkness, I can still smell the smells coming up from the ground,&quot; said Mr Hilton-Barber. &quot;Even at 5,000ft, I can smell whether I&apos;m going over a city or a factory or a field with crops and whether they&apos;re growing corn or wheat down there. I can also feel when we&apos;re going along the edge of a cloud, because I sense the moisture in the air and there&apos;s a damp and musty smell.&quot; The record-breaking flight set off from Biggin Hill airfield on March 7, heading south across France, Italy and the Mediterranean towards Syria and Jordan. From there, the microlight crossed the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Singapore and the island of East Timor before a long sea crossing to Darwin, then down the east coast of Australia to Sydney. Along the way, there have been a few scrapes. &quot;The other day it was very turbulent weather so we climbed up to 12,000ft to try to get out of it, which, for a microlight, is very high. It was so cold I was shaking and shivering and Richard had to keep a very close eye on me,&quot; he said. &quot;The degree of concentration needed is very high because I&apos;m having to listen to information constantly. My brain goes soggy towards the end of every day.&quot; The microlight has also been engulfed in a snowstorm in the Middle East, caught up in a tropical storm over Malaysia and hit by thermal blasts over Saudi Arabia which sent the tiny aircraft spiralling up into the sky. &quot;It was like being in an elevator that was out of control and it was a very alarming thing because the microlight is completely open to the elements and you only have a seatbelt to hold you in,&quot; he said. &quot;We really took a hammering.&quot; Mr Hilton-Barber lost his sight 25 years ago because of an inherited genetic disorder which also blinded his brother. &quot;I used to see my blindness as a disability and I felt very sorry for myself but now I see it as a challenge,&quot; he said. He is now a full-time adventurer and motivational speaker and hopes to raise \u00a31m for the charity Seeing is Believing, which aims to restore sight or prevent blindness in the developing world. According to the charity there are 37 million blind people in the world but 75% of blindness is avoidable or repairable to some degree. &quot;Cataracts, river blindness, vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition... these types of blindness are preventable or can be fixed and that is why I am raising money,&quot; he said. Mr Hilton-Barber is being sponsored by Standard Chartered Bank, which will match every pound he raises. He is due to finish his journey on Monday by piloting his microlight around Sydney harbour in a triumphant finale before returning home to Derbyshire and to his wife Stephanie and their three children. He will be flying back to the UK on a jumbo jet and says he is looking forward to sleeping all the way home. Mr Hilton-Barber, who has climbed in the Himalayas, taken part in marathons and other extreme endurance sports and attempted to become the first blind person to reach the South Pole, is already planning his next challenge. He wants to be the first blind person to fly an aircraft through the sound barrier.

We adjusted to the heat in Sabah&apos;s capital, Kota Kinabalu. Flattened during the second world war by Allied bombing, the small town was rebuilt in the 1950s on a tidy grid system that reminded us a little of Miami. Its busy main street is lined with traditional &quot;shophouses&quot; - residential flats above shops. The markets are crowded and noisy, selling fruit and vegetables, herbs, spices, fish, chickens, basketware, orchids and ironmongery, and there are plenty of cafes and bars. After Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu is reputed to be the liveliest place in Malaysia.  Borneo is the third largest island in the world and holds a strategic position in the middle of an important trading route between east and west. Once, it too was a trading focus for many nations, who exploited exotic jungle produce such as rhino horn, dammar resin, hornbill casques, kingfisher feathers and swifts&apos; nests.  In 1879, two independently wealthy brothers, Alfred and Edward Dent, leased land from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, enabling them to establish the British North Borneo Company, mainly trading jungle produce with Singapore. Two years later they were granted a royal charter. What had North Borneo been like when the British first arrived, we wondered. Kerry Tabrett has lived for many years on the island and is well versed in its history. &quot;The country was all jungle, completely undeveloped. When the British arrived, their first job was to clear out the pirates and stop the gun-running that went on. There were around 35 different tribes, the most fearsome being the Kadazan headhunters. Each of the tribes had different beliefs and ways of life. They were perpetually fighting and enslaving each other. The British planned to end the conflict, outlaw slavery, then plant coconut, tobacco and, later, rubber, bringing in Chinese labour to work the estates.  &quot;Two of the strong things the British brought,&quot; said Kerry, &quot;were the law and respect for peace, so people could begin to trade.&quot; The Monsopiad Cultural Village, the only one of its kind in Sabah, is built where Monsopiad, a great Kadazan warrior, once lived. Today, his descendants have built and manage this village, which aims to let visitors experience the Kadazans&apos; way of life and to keep their culture alive. We crossed a rope bridge over a river that led into a clearing filled with native houses. Built of wood, bamboo and thatch, they stand on stilts so that neither rats nor water can get in and the airflow keeps the interior cool. In the centre of the village, a large stone monolith, Gintutun do Mohoing, was once used for human sacrifice: the victim was tied to it and killed with bamboo spears. Tall bamboo poles surround it: the top of each is cup-shaped to hold a severed head as it dried in the open air. It is said that the stone is inhabited by spirits from the past. We climbed steep wooden steps up to the longhouse of Agil Bajarai, the descendant of a headhunter. It had been raining heavily when we arrived but inside it was completely dry. Large pots lined one wall and from the central roof beam 42 skulls, darkened with age, were tied together with a natural twine, striking a macabre note. Outside, a cock crowing or the clang of a gong broke the unnerving stillness in the house. Agil is a tall, soft-spoken Kadazan, who immediately put us at ease. &quot;Headhunters would take the head for its power,&quot; he explained. &quot;They were taking the spirit of the person to use it as a blessing or to heal people. The more spirits you had the better, because then you could communicate with the next world. When you had someone&apos;s head, you automatically had everything else that belonged to him. We keep these heads to show the next generation so that they know their roots.&quot; To earn their royal charter, the British North Borneo Company had to show that they could make money in Borneo. Quelling the natives was time-consuming and the jungle lacked infrastructure, but there were unique treasures to be found - even if they weren&apos;t the money-spinners some had hoped for. A few decades earlier, Sir Hugh Low, a naturalist and colonial administrator based in Labuan, had climbed Mount Kinabalu three times, the first white man to reach its summit. He wrote about and drew what he found on the mountain&apos;s slopes. He was intrigued by the proliferation of orchids he discovered, some the size of pinheads and others with cascades of white flowers several metres long. To date, 480 different species have been named. Victorian England became obsessed with orchids, so much so that a new word was coined &quot;orchidelirium&quot;. Orchid-collecting was a status symbol for the rich, although it was considered unsuitable for women: the flowers were seen as too sexually suggestive, their name deriving from the Latin word orchis, meaning testicle. Nevertheless, Queen Victoria was an enthusiast and collector. The last place on our itinerary was at the edge of virgin rainforest: the Sepilok rehabilitation centre for orang-utans. Borneo is one of the few places that is still home to a creature that had a fundamental impact not only on Victorian Britain but on the world&apos;s thinking. In 1838, Charles Darwin saw his first primate - an orang-utan named Jenny, in London Zoo. He was astonished by how human she looked - which led to his first thoughts on human evolution, then a theory that caused a storm in Christian Victorian Britain. That man should be descended from an ape was absurd. Indeed, when Queen Victoria saw a second orang-utan at the zoo and &quot;took tea with it&quot;, she commented that it was &quot;frightful, and painfully and disagreeably human&quot;. A short drive from the old island capital of Sandakan, the orang-utan centre was founded in 1964 on the edge of the Kabili Sepilok forest reserve. Sepilok was set up after the British introduced the timber trade to the island. Initially &quot;clear felling&quot; meant that an area was completely cleared, which simultaneously destroyed the indigenous wildlife. The British soon grasped the devastation that this was causing, which led to the foundation of the first forest reserves in Sabah. Today, the Sabah Wildlife Department works hard to preserve these precious species, not least for their appeal to tourists. The government is also trying to ensure that logging is done sustainably so the animals have a chance to move deeper into the forest. Now Sabah Wildlife protects the orang-utan with the help of the Sepilok Orang-utan Appeal, a British-based charity set up by Sue Sheward, who raises money for the animals through an adoption scheme. Dr Sen Nathan, chief wildlife vet at Sabah wildlife department, introduced us to orphaned orang-utans. &quot;If a tree needs to be felled in the process of land clearing, a mother orang-utan may be high up a tree when it is cut without the logger realising. The tree is cut, the mother falls, breaks the fall of the young ones and dies. Sometimes the young are kept as pets by the workers - loggers or those converting the land for agriculture - or they are handed over to Sabah Wildlife and brought here. Sabah Wildlife has an enforcement unit. We have teams that act on tip-offs and collect baby orang-utans that have been kept as pets. It&apos;s illegal to keep them as pets here, and if you are caught, there&apos;s a mandatory six-month jail sentence and a hefty fine.&quot; Often when the animals arrive, they have to be retrained to eat the appropriate diet. Sen told us of a childless Indonesian couple, estate workers on an oil-palm plantation, who &quot;kept a baby orang-utan for three years. They dressed and fed him as a baby. When we went to get him, they didn&apos;t want to let him go. But when we explained they might go to jail, they understood that they had to.&quot; Once the animals have been rehabilitated, the centre has no way of knowing what happens to them. &quot;They have identichips and three numbers tattooed on their leg so you can identify them if they return here,&quot; explained Sheena, &quot;but you can&apos;t track them. All we can do is follow them on foot.&quot;  Borneo still seems an outpost, fighting to preserve tolerance in an increasingly intolerant world, where fundamentalism would like to reign. In the lush park below Mount Kinabalu&apos;s Victoria Peak, we were taken aback to hear one park guide call some of the first British settlers, Sabah&apos;s &quot;first pioneers&quot;, the men who catalogued and attempted to understand his homeland&apos;s glorious natural history. To others in Sabah, the British brought peace, education and administration allowing a previously tribal country to enter a world stage, yet they introduced with it a system riddled with racism. Just as in the other places we visited, the British arrived and made a definite mark. \u00b7 Victoria&apos;s Empire by Victoria Wood, Frank Welsh &amp; Fanny Blake published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton at \u00a318.99 is on sale from next week.

They pay people to translate works of European literature that would otherwise have only the smallest imaginable audience in this country. The books themselves are both gorgeous and practical. I even like the paper they use. And \u00a37.99 isn&apos;t going to break the bank. But even if Pushkin charged double the price and printed their books on loo-roll they would still have to be praised to the skies because they seem to be on a mission to publish everything written by Stefan Zweig. It is a pity that Zweig&apos;s name isn&apos;t better known here these days. He was once hugely, internationally popular: in exile from Nazi Austria in England, he ruefully conceded that he was one of only 10 German-language authors who could actually afford to be in his situation (not that he found this much of a consolation in the end). He is one of the masters of the short story and novella, and by &quot;one of the masters&quot; I mean that he&apos;s up there with Maupassant, Chekhov, James, Poe, or indeed anyone you care to name. The first story in this collection, though, recalls Conrad more than anyone else: it employs a device Zweig was fond of, the story-within-a-story; this, its ship-board setting and its narrative of a man driven crazy by the heat recall Heart of Darkness: &quot;Sooner or later we all succumb to our weaknesses, some drink, others smoke opium, others again act like brutes - some kind of folly comes over us all.&quot; And, as with Conrad, what fascinates him is the internal state of a person who has been exposed to an extreme event. The four stories here all end - I apologise for giving away the endings, but it&apos;s unavoidable - with an act of suicide. Actually, there are quite a few of Zweig&apos;s stories which contain suicides; you could almost imagine that suicide was his preferred formal method of narrative resolution. His own life ended by his own hand, as he contemplated the fall of Singapore and what in 1942 looked like the inevitable triumph of the Third Reich. But suicide isn&apos;t, by any means, all that these works are about: in fact, now that I&apos;ve let that particular cat out of the bag, you can concentrate more on what leads his characters to their ends. What propels the catastrophes of two of the tales here (&quot;Amok&quot; and &quot;The Star Above the Forest&quot;) is sexual or romantic longing, and when you read Zweig you are struck by the debilitating prudishness that afflicted almost all English writers until ... well, I am tempted to say Martin Amis. To read Zweig is to be in the presence of a properly mature writer, for all that his characters are often in the grip of highly inappropriate desires. (Well, they wouldn&apos;t be such fascinating stories if that weren&apos;t the case.) The third story here is almost about sex: a thick-witted servant becomes insanely devoted to her titled master, with disastrous results; its uneasy traverse across the class divide makes for another subject-matter that most English authors of the time found too alarming to contemplate. The final story, &quot;Incident on Lake Geneva&quot;, is a short parable about the human cost of war; first published in 1936, but set in 1918, it is, with exquisite brevity, a meditation on the extinction of human values that Zweig could see around him. &quot;There&apos;s no way anyone can help anyone else these days,&quot; says a character. These are unforgettable stories, beautifully translated: I can&apos;t compare them with the original, but there&apos;s no sense of any nuance being lost.

The London-based firm is not so much breaking bread as breaking new ground. No UK fast food firm has ever succeeded in America. But after several years of uncertainty, Americans are increasingly tucking into Pret&apos;s chemical-free fare. Its 11 New York shops are set to make profits for the first time. That has given Julian Metcalfe, the super-smooth 46-year-old Harrovian who jointly owns the firm, the confidence to open another five New York stores this year. And with profits this year set to exceed \u00a330m, expansion in the Far East is also being considered. This explains why Pret is also looking at a massive fundraising drive that could see its shares listed on the London stock market next year; Metcalfe accidentally let slip last week, at the launch of a Pret recipe book, that he was considering a \u00a3280m flotation. Though plans are at an early stage and no investment bankers have yet been hired, a float would see Metcalfe&apos;s one-third stake valued at \u00a390m. And there would be another major beneficiary: McDonald&apos;s, the world&apos;s biggest fast food chain. It owns a third of Pret shares, having paid \u00a350m for its stake six years ago. Such a windfall would vindicate Metcalfe&apos;s decision to create a sandwich empire from scratch that has become an established part of the capital&apos;s high streets and is growing in strength outside London. Formed 21 years ago by a pair of trainee property surveyors, today Pret a Manger employs 2,000 people in more than 180 branches in the UK, Hong Kong, New York and Singapore. Its sandwiches aren&apos;t cheap, but what keeps many returning to its bright, stainless-steel restaurants - interiors like the inside of a lunch box - is the reliable high quality of the product. Neil Saunders, consulting director at retail research firm Verdict, says: &apos;When they started, they were instantly successful and one of the reasons was that they were providing substantial sandwiches at a time when the best you could get was slim filling in between bits of cardboard. What&apos;s happened since then is that people have become much more concerned about where their food comes from and environmental issues, and Pret fits into that. They don&apos;t use chemicals, and food is made on site. They&apos;re concerned about packaging. This fits into market trends.&apos; And there is another factor: the friendliness of its staff - an all-too-rare commodity on British high streets. For a fast food chain, Pret has an unusually meritocratic structure. Promotions are normally made from within. When it did attempt to appoint a senior executive from outside the firm six years ago, the move ended in acrimony. Pret managers organise a staff vote to determine which among them receives bonuses in the form of company shares. This may sound divisive, but the company says it fosters a &apos;cohesive, family tree structure&apos;. Pret was formed because Metcalfe was unable to find a decent and nutritious lunch in the Victoria area of central London, where he was working. With colleague Sinclair Beecham, who also still retains a one-third stake, he decided to make his own. Things did not go smoothly at first. &apos;The model then was to prepare the food downstairs, bring it up on beautiful platters and serve it,&apos; he said last year. &apos;While we had lots of customers, we never made any money.&apos; After four &apos;depressing&apos; years he tried a new model - still selling fresh, good quality food, but putting it all into boxes. &apos;Pret are pioneers. They have raised standards and they realised people want real food,&apos; says David Boyle, a fellow at the New Economics Foundation. &apos;But there&apos;s no doubt Pret is part of the homogenisation of the high street. They are in a stronger position than locally owned cafes because they have scale.&apos; For the humble sandwich, these are heady times. Next month, the British Sandwich Association will celebrate the 245th anniversary of John Montagu, fourth Earl of Sandwich, placing a slice of meat between two pieces of bread. The story is that Montagu wanted a snack he could eat while playing cards. Now most working Britons munch at their desks. Last year Britain spent \u00a34.5bn on this versatile snack - a rise of 6 per cent on the previous year. Jim Winship, director of the BSA, says: &apos;The whole concept is spreading over to Europe and the States. The French are keen to knock English food but this is a real British success story.&apos; In business, it seems there&apos;s little Metcalfe can do wrong. His other chain of restaurants, Itsu, was at the centre of investigations after Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was killed by radiation poisoning. Litvinenko visited the restaurant on the day he was taken ill, but it seems the deadly dose was administered elsewhere. Metcalfe had to shut the restaurant - a disaster in the making - but four weeks later the publicity worked to his advantage and trade boomed. There may be clouds on the horizon. Increasingly, food companies have realised the British palate has increased in sophistication, and, from M&amp;S to smaller independents, high quality food is now readily available. But, for now, Pret goes from strength to strength."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/apr/29/foodanddrink.shopping2", "sentences": ["If a menu needs explaining, rewrite it until it doesn&apos;t.

At Suka, a new hipper-than-thou joint in London&apos;s Sanderson Hotel, which does to the noble culinary traditions of Malaysia what the Romans did to the Sabine women, they have managed it. Most of the seating is at long, wide, refectory-style tables that are so high you have to sit around them on tall bar stools. It means the waiters can only reach one diner at a time, and if you are seated against the dividing wall, as we were, waiters have to walk 15ft down one side, across the end and back up again, to get from one guest to the other. Any attempt at conversation - &apos;God I hate this place. How can they live with themselves,&apos; etc - kept being interrupted by waiters trudging off into the distance and back again to deliver cutlery, water or the bad news that dinner wasn&apos;t over yet. The one advantage of this set-up was that the waitress was so far away from me, and the music so loud, I couldn&apos;t really hear her recitation of the menu&apos;s &apos;concept&apos;.

Why? They are on the menu every night. Was it just that usually the kitchen buggered them up and now they had got them right? Or was it that, at \u00a315, they were one of the most expensive starters? We ignored her. Instead we ordered the marinated rib-eye and foie gras skewers - satay by any other name. The meat itself was good, but at \u00a315 for just six cubes of beef, each less than an inch square, with three tiny nuggets of liver, it felt like a mugging on nice crockery. A grilled tiger prawn salad at \u00a316 brought only two, clinging to each other for support against a viciously overdressed lentil salad. Worst of the lot was a curried crab laksa, which was a bastardisation of a fantastic dish. The broth was a one-note battering ram of chilli oil, with no layers of flavour, not improved by a quickly soggy fried crab cake boasting the texture of a sponge. The main courses are dominated by platters for two, which come at a staggering price: Vietnamese mint-glazed lamb at \u00a355, Sarawak peppered rib-eye at \u00a360. We ordered the suckling pig, at a mere \u00a344, and for our money got a plate of slightly dry pulled pork, with the occasional nice piece of crackling, surrounded by the accompaniments to Chinese crispy duck: pancakes, sliced spring onions, hoi sin sauce, etc. All it did was remind us how nice, and what good value, crispy duck usually is and how this plateful was neither. A side of broccoli with salted fish was simply unpleasant. We drank two glasses of wine from a list which starts at \u00a326 a bottle. I also ordered a non-alcoholic version of one of their cocktails and was startled to see, when the bill came, that they had charged the full alcoholic \u00a39.50 price.

It was certainly what first struck me on returning from a recent trip abroad - literally, in the form of a wind-blown plastic bag attaching itself to my waist like a seedy sarong the second I emerged on to the pavement outside Heathrow airport. The British may cherish their weekly refuse collection (in the face of calls to make it fortnightly) but such incidents do make you wonder: are the British, to quote from Jeremy Paxman&apos;s recent anti-litter diatribe in this newspaper, &quot;a uniquely sordid people&quot;? Is Britain especially dirty? Those are, in fact, separate questions. To address the second question first, although there are too few comparable national littering studies to answer it definitively, evidence in a recent research paper from the environmental charity Encams suggests Britain as a country that probably does stand out for its trash. There is, first, the matter of expenditure. While cities such as Frankfurt and Brussels, for example, have street cleaning budgets of \u20ac100m (\u00a368m), a comparable city such as Manchester spends \u00a38m. You are also unlikely to be fined for littering in Britain. The few dozen environmental enforcement officers patrolling the streets of Amsterdam issue around 7,000 penalties a year; in all of England, there are about 500 litter convictions annually. Fines in continental Europe may not be on the scale of Singapore&apos;s - \u00a3400 for a first offence - but they typically sting more than England&apos;s \u00a350 and tend to carry a greater burden of shame. Powerful perception Finally, there is the perception, on the part of visitors and the British themselves, that Britain&apos;s streets are notably foul. Lonely Planet&apos;s most recent London guidebook may be less scathing about the city&apos;s environment than previous editions, but it still bemoans all the litter. In the absence of more objective indicators, the powerful perception that Britain has a litter problem can be taken as further evidence that, indeed, it has. Perception is, after all, precisely what litter offends. But that conclusion is so often coupled, as in Paxman&apos;s lament, with another claim that Britain in the past was spic and span and has only recently been so defiled. But the truth is that Britain has long been a pigsty. What has changed, however, is the quantity and kind of rubbish. Take London, for example. One can only wish the Keep Britain Tidy campaign good luck with Capital Standards, its new push to tidy up London in time for the Olympics, but in the long run it is bound to be frustrated. London is not only - as the writer Ian Sinclair, one of the city&apos;s most ardent recent chroniclers, described it to me - &quot;the epicentre of British rubbish&quot;, but possibly also of the world&apos;s. The garbage-strewn vista of pre-modern London is shorthand, in art and literature, for urban dystopia. Sinclair was astonished to discover, on a recent walk through Epping Forest, what he calls the &quot;rubbish contour lines&quot; of London. &quot;Approaching a nexus of cafes and roadside fast-food places,&quot; he recalls, he came upon &quot;Red Bull cans, lager cans, takeaway packages - a refuse line marking a trail back to the city&quot;. But he would have found some kind of litter periphery at almost any time in the history of the great metropolis. Look into the archives and you find Londoners constantly complaining about rubbish. Britain introduced a Sanitary Act as far back as 1338 but, by the 17th century, citing its &quot;apparent neglect ... throughout the City&quot;, one of Ken Livingstone&apos;s mayoral predecessors, Sir John Robinson, was threatening a fine of 20 shillings for any Londoner who failed to keep &quot;ashes, dust, filth, ordure, or other noisome thing whatsoever&quot; within their backyards until &quot;the raker or scavenger do come to carry away the same&quot;. The difference between modern rubbish and the rubbish of yore is that the latter was almost entirely organic. For centuries, pigs were left to roam among the human population in urban England, to snuffle up the rotting garbage on the streets. That reeking detritus must have had competition in the form of the human ordure that, as Emily Cockayne informs us in Hubbub, her recent book on &quot;filth, noise and stench&quot; in England, was often used to bulk out the walls of houses. Litter nostalgists look back no further than the 19th century and what John Scanlan, in his book On Garbage, calls &quot;the great cleanup&quot;, signalled by the introduction, in 1848, of the Public Health Act and, with it, systematic waste regulation. The Victorians conjoined cleanliness and virtue, a union that endured until the 1950s before the slide into the litter free-for-all of today. The 19th century also saw the expansion of the industrial revolution, born in Britain and the source of an explosion in the production of consumer goods. A nation of shopkeepers would seek to derive maximum profit from the latter by their minute dispensation in small glass, metal and, soon, plastic disposal packages. In time, pre-packaging, by the food processor or manufacturer, did away with the need for clerks measuring out supplies to customers on the shop floor. Thus were born the serried self-service aisles of packaged goods otherwise known as supermarkets - or dispensaries of pre-rubbish. We live in the age of packaging, and much of it on the streets of Britain today has been wrapped briefly around a greasy burger or kebab. In its latest national muckraking survey, Keep Britain Tidy found fast-food litter on a quarter of British streets. Disposable containers, which save on washing-up labour, are relatively sanitary and will not be pilfered, are so much a part of the fast-food industry that without them it would not exist. And Britain, with barely even the leftovers of a culinary tradition to call its own, has taken to fast food faster than probably any other European nation. Pizza slices But our neighbours are catching up. Even the French, according to a recent survey, list pizza slices as their favourite takeaway. British rubbish, in other words, could be the future - and that, according to Alexander Judd, a retired American can-manufacturing supremo, would be no bad thing. In his treatise, In Defence of Garbage, he argues that the benefits of packaging, in cutting food spoilage, increasing choice and in its sheer convenience, far outweigh incidental things such as litter. He is incredulous at people&apos;s yearning for the unsanitary, unpacked food of old. Deciding what is rubbish and what is good is a prerequisite of civilisation. There is, Scanlan reminds us, &quot;no waste in nature&quot;. Similarly, Judd enjoins us to recognise garbage as part of &quot;the inevitable residue of commerce&quot;; he recognises that the profit motive, rather than any moral failing, explains much of our modern rubbish. For him, the middens of crisp packets, cola bottles, carrier bags and sweet wrappers that mark Britain like the spoor of some garbage monster should be taken as a sign of blooming economic health. Yet it is, I suspect, precisely the intimate connection of garbage with civilisation that makes people abhor rather than applaud it. Rubbish, the sociologist Reiner Grundmann notes, &quot;is matter out of place&quot;. The litter scudding about our city streets hints terrifyingly at the underside of civilisation, at the disorder into which it could so easily collapse. That loathing can be exploited; unpopular councils do so regularly when they splash out on street-cleaning drives, for example. But such efforts, whatever their scale, must ultimately fail. Everything ends up as litter, including ourselves - which is perhaps what most bothers us about it.  \u00b7 Simon Busch is a journalist \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.

The film also opened in eight countries across the far east. Sony Pictures vice chairman Jeff Blake said it was &quot;bigger than Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 everywhere&quot;. If that performance is repeated here and in the US at the weekend the film could well become one of the highest grossing movies of all time in the US. 2002&apos;s Spider-Man currently stands at No 7 on that list, with $403,706,000, while 2004&apos;s Spider-Man 2 has $373,377,000 in tenth spot. The all-time record both in the US and worldwide is held by Titanic, with $600,779,000 and $1,835,300,000 respectively. However the far east box office may have been boosted by Sony&apos;s decision to play up its Japanese credentials. The studio staged the world premiere in Tokyo and brought stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst along for the ride. Spider-Man 3 certainly needs a good performance as the studio says it cost a phenomenal $258m to make. This already makes it the most expensive film of all time - beating King Kong&apos;s 2005 record of $207m, but some reports have placed that figure closer to the $500m mark. In South Korea and Hong Kong, the picture set new marks for an opening day, taking 3.2bn won (\u00a31.7m) and $HK7.5m (\u00a3480,000), respectively. Sales in Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand were the highest for any single day, opening or otherwise. Taiwan sales were the biggest for any weekday.

But within three years I had found myself a boyfriend and one year after that I&apos;d come out to all my family and friends. However, I still felt that being an out gay man in the macho City environment would be a bad idea. So when I got asked to work in Singapore for a few months in the early 1990s, I had a dilemma. Most young guys would jump at an opportunity like that, but it was clear to my boss that something was troubling me, so he took me into a room off the trading floor to ask me about it. &quot;I think there is something worrying you about this Singapore project we have asked you to do,&quot; said my boss. &quot;Is there any way I can help?&quot; I sat there and looked at his smiling, open face and decided that I could trust him. &quot;Er, well,&quot; I replied, &quot;I&apos;m not sure how to tell you this so I&apos;m just going to say it. I don&apos;t know what to do about my boyfriend while I&apos;m away. I&apos;ll miss him terribly and he&apos;ll miss me, I&apos;m sure.&quot; The poor guy&apos;s face went as white as a sheet. But, as I found out later, it was only because he had no idea how to handle the situation. I was worried about whether I&apos;d just ruined my career, but my boss was concerned to make sure that he didn&apos;t discriminate against me because of my sexuality. And in fact, the bank was so anxious to treat me fairly that it offered to fly my boyfriend out to Singapore to visit me regularly during my stay there. Although I have never really come out at work, since then I have never tried to hide it either. My rule has been to avoid telling lies about girlfriends I don&apos;t have, and concentrate on doing a good job for whoever I have been working for. Of course, as a result of coming out to my boss in the early 1990s, everyone who has worked with me has ended up knowing that I&apos;m gay. Back then, my boss told his boss, and once his PA knew then all the other secretaries knew, and everyone else found out from there by a process of osmosis. I&apos;ve worked for several other banks since, and on the most recent occasion when I changed jobs I asked the people who had worked for me at that bank whether they knew I was gay. Initially, they were embarrassed that I&apos;d asked the question but, of course, somehow they all knew, and no one had cared. I guess Lord Browne comes from an older generation than me, where homosexuality was much more taboo. Like many guys, I had a hard time admitting to myself that I was gay, but once I&apos;d crossed the Rubicon in that respect it quickly became clear to me that no one really cared that much. But during Browne&apos;s formative years homosexuality was still a criminal offence. Things have changed a lot in the City in recent years. These days, every bank seems to have some kind of internal network of gay employees, and there is even a regular inter-bank drinks gathering for gay men and women who work in wholesale finance. Poor Browne seems to have sunk himself for keeping an unnecessary secret. \u00b7 Written by a gay City executive who writes an anonymous blog under the pseudonym GB.

There is a stereotype that oil is a very macho business but, oddly enough, I have found that there is a very gay-friendly culture at my work. When I joined I wasn&apos;t really out - and I am still not with some of my family - but, within a year, I had come out professionally. My colleagues have been enormously supportive and it has been a complete non-issue. Over the years, I have experienced some puerile schoolboy banter. A completely unreconstructed colleague used to make the odd joke about it, although we actually became quite good friends. At one point, though, he made a joke about a client in front of our boss and ended up getting fired several months later. He was dismissed for a range of different reasons but that kind of attitude - he also made sexist comments about women - just was not tolerated. A lot of my work is with clients across Europe, the Middle East and central Asia. I respect the culture I am in. I can&apos;t imagine tipping up in a Muslim country in shorts and a vest, but if I was straight I wouldn&apos;t turn up in shorts and a vest either. If clients figure out I am gay that is fine, but if they don&apos;t that is also fine. The only awkwardness was when I worked in Russia a decade or so ago. Occasionally a client would try and set me up with a female companion for the evening. I would get myself out of that situation, but the clients were not really guilty of homophobia - it was simply a different way of doing business. Within the oil industry, it was common knowledge that John Browne was gay and no one cared about it. I can&apos;t remember him ever bringing a partner to an event but it just was not an issue. The issue was how to find oil reserves, how to make more money from reserves and how to improve efficiency. The City tends to be a little bit more gung-ho and macho but I think that is a British trait as opposed to a characteristic of the industry. The financial markets in New York are much less puerile than they are in London. When I&apos;ve worked with City institutions many of my clients have been women. I think they preferred the fact that my approach was slightly less macho than is typical. The oil industry is rather maligned with this macho stereotype. But the industry is interested in making money. It is not terribly bothered with people&apos;s sexuality."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/04/business.cheapflights", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines&apos; and Cathay Pacific&apos;s refit of their premium cabins, Virgin&apos;s new routes to Chicago and Nairobi, Air New Zealand&apos;s new round-the-world routing, Silverjet&apos;s new all-business-class service and BA&apos;s extravagant new Club World all fit snugly into the business category."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-04T10:01:13Z", "title": "Business traveller's diary", "tags": ["Travel", "Business travel", "Cheap flights", "New York holidays"], "article": "Flights: 8Miles flown: 6,838Destinations: Munich, London, Ascot, Brussels, New York, PhiladelphiaNights in a hotel: 10Nights on a dancefloor: 7Satisfaction rating: 9.65/10 It certainly has been a complex, logistically-challenged fortnight.

Zoom begins flights from Gatwick to JFK for the scarcely credible sum of \u00a3129; Flyglobespan offer connections from Liverpool to New York; Oasis Airlines provide unfeasibly cheap flights to Hong Kong, and Ryanair are about to offer to pay you for the privilege of traversing the Atlantic (well, not quite but at \u00a37 it almost seems that way). The availability of exotic travel to the masses is something no premium traveller, however weak their egalitarian spirit, should sniff about. But you don&apos;t need to be an avowed environmentalist to feel more than a touch queasy at the prospect. More flights mean more filthy emissions, and though low-cost airlines carry more people per plane, they are less likely to invest in fuel-efficient solutions than the aviation powerhouses such as BA, Virgin or Lufthansa.  Furthermore, the very concept of long, battery-chicken flights \u2013 with the loss of inflight service entailing certain dehydration and near death \u2013 is undeniably unappealing, especially to the aviation romantic. You only have to look at inflight photographs from the 1970s to understand that flying used to be part of the holiday, not a gruesome experience you had to endure.  British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) flights to Tokyo carried beaming, grateful guests, served by Japanese air hostesses wearing kimonos; Air India flights to the UK landed amid raucous scenes of mass celebration and overflowing emotion. What a contrast to the fearful prospect ahead of us: comatose travellers trying their very hardest to summon their last remaining reserves of energy for the three-mile-long immigration queue.  As a business traveller, you may be wondering what on earth the last two paragraphs have to do with you. My answer: much more than you might think. We live in an era of ferocious expense-cutting, with regular employee travel incessantly questioned by increasingly cost-conscious chiefs. It has become, I&apos;ve noticed with not insignificant misery, almost standard practice for junior and middle managers to travel economy or worse in Europe.  EasyJet and Ryanair have gleefully announced significant increases in their business travel market shares. Longhaul travel is also being rendered a nightmare by shifting company policy: a significant percentage of large British companies now demand that flights under nine hours be undertaken in premium economy (not business). So how long before your boss declares that you must fly Zoom or Ryanair to New York? I would surmise the board-level plotting has already begun. Surely we deserve better? All the days spent away from home, all the hours spent slaving at the coalface, all the minutes spent craving the warmth of our loved-ones surely merit something approaching comfortable travel? Well, yes, of course. It is scandalous to me that hard-working employees might be made to suffer in this fashion. Working after an eight-hour flight is hard enough, but the additional horrors of low-cost in-flight &quot;service&quot; are enough to consider on-the-spot resignation.  And lest we forget, it&apos;s not just the flight that will kill you. The pre-flight shenanigans are likely to be just as painful. No more swift, 15-minute Heathrow Express ride, no more First Lounge at Heathrow T1, no more Smythson stationery at Heathrow T4. Instead, interminable hikes to Stansted and Luton, airports seemingly closer to Holland than the UK yet still (hilariously) prefixed with &quot;London&quot;.  So beware my dear business traveller. And, to all you senior managers out there, have a heart. Please.

On Monday, Oasis Airlines (oasishongkong.com) starts selling flights from Hong Kong to Vancouver, becoming the first low-cost carrier to cross the Pacific, and in doing so, creating the final link in a network of low-cost carriers that allow you to circle to globe for a fraction of the previous price.  The first flight to Vancouver takes off on June 28 and has a starting price of \u00a3163 (one-way, including tax), which places it around 40% cheaper than the current lowest fares. Like easyJet, Oasis sells the first set of seats at a knock-down price with the fare rising as the plane fills. It is now possible to buy an Oasis Airlines flight from London Gatwick to Hong Kong (from \u00a3152), then another on to Vancouver for a shade over \u00a3315, all in. Next you can book a flight to a number of Canadian cities, including Montreal and Toronto, with low-cost Canadian carrier West Jet (westjet.com; prices start at \u00a389). And finally, to complete the circuit, you can book a low-cost transatlantic flight with Zoom (flyzoom.com) to several UK airports, from \u00a3129, including tax. If you book early enough, it is possible book all four tickets for a total of \u00a3533. The same route, booked on an around- the-world ticket with STA Travel (statravel.com) would cost around \u00a31,200. At the moment, such low-cost circumnavigations are restricted to flying through Canadian airspace. But later this year, when Oasis launches a service from Hong Kong to Oakland near San Francisco (and then to Chicago beyond that), it will be possible to route through the US as well. What you do then is book a connecting Oakland-New York flight with JetBlue (jetblueairways.com), which starts at \u00a399, inc tax, and then a flight home, again with Zoom. An added bonus is that JetBlue flies to dozens of US cities, meaning that you can hop off at several points at little extra cost.  But the reach of the low-cost airlines doesn&apos;t stop there. Again, by using Hong Kong as your initial port of call, it&apos;s technically possible to fly to Australia using a similar strategy. Another low-cost carrier JetStar (jetstar.com) flies out of Hong Kong and on to Singapore and Jakarta. From Singapore, the same airline flies on to Darwin and Cairns in Australia, as well as Malaysia, Cambodia and several other Asian cities. Mind you, while it&apos;s possible to fly London to Oz in just three low-cost hops, anyone wanting to travel down under by the cheapest and easiest route should, obviously, buy a regular flight. Once you have added up the extra taxes and airport transfers, a trio of low-cost flights is no cheaper. But the point is, such low-cost, long-haul flights are more suitable for open-jaw journeys, extended stopovers and circuitous routes. Elsewhere, a number of Indian carriers, like Indigo (book.goindigo.in) offer internal flights for as little as \u00a33 one-way, while a clutch of Thai (nokair.com), Indonesian (lionair.co.id) and Singaporean (tigerairways.com) carriers all vie to offer ever cheaper deals.  Soon even more of these will be connected to the long-haul route. Last week, Air Asia (airasia.com), which already serves south-east Asia, said that from the end of the year it plans to offer flights to Kuala Lumpur from either Manchester or Stansted starting at just \u00a3130.  Have a look over the horizon and a whole world of low-cost flying awaits. sean.dodson@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/06/features.sport10", "sentences": ["Being in Singapore in 2005 when London was awarded the 2012 Games was the highlight of my career, after gold in Sydney (I was more nervous in Singapore than I was before the last event in Sydney)."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-05T23:13:18Z", "title": "Ten questions for ... Denise Lewis", "tags": ["Sport"], "article": "1. Did you always want to be an athlete? Yes, but it wasn&apos;t easy. I grew up in Wolverhampton and had to take the bus to Birmingham to train. It would be nine at night when I got home and I still had homework to do. It was no easier when I started as a &apos;professional&apos;. There was no lottery money then, so I had to hold down a job. My mum wasn&apos;t convinced it was the right move. 2. What about your Olympic ambitions?  I&apos;ll never forget how frustrated I felt when I didn&apos;t make the team for Barcelona in 1992. The following year I missed the world championships through injury. I knew then that I had to look again at my approach: I cut back on KFC takeaways and all the other things that come with being young and going out.  3. Didn&apos;t you nearly miss out on Sydney in 2000?  I was injured in the early part of 2000 and spent 10 weeks barely able to walk. When the doctor said that he wasn&apos;t sure if I would be fit for the Games, I broke down in tears. In the warm-ups at Sydney, I wouldn&apos;t take my tights off because I didn&apos;t want anyone to see how heavily strapped my leg was. When you&apos;ve built up to something like that, you can&apos;t afford to have negative speculation about your fitness. 4. Were you surprised by the way you were criticised afterwards for concentrating on your off-track earnings?  I remember thinking, &apos;Hold on, I&apos;ve just won an Olympic gold and I&apos;m being treated like a criminal.&apos; Athletes make nothing like the money that footballers or even cricketers earn. If you are a female athlete you are at the bottom of the ladder. If you&apos;ve got the personality, the looks, the talent - because nothing comes without that - no one should begrudge you if someone wants to pay you to endorse their product. Other countries laugh at us for how we annihilate our champions. 5. Do you regret working with Dr Ekkart Arbeit in 2003?  No. He was associated with steroid use in East Germany in the Seventies. I condemn that completely, but that was in the past. When the Balco scandal broke, I realised how hypocritical people in this country are. Here we were paying huge appearance fees to bring Americans to Britain to compete, even as we were beginning to hear allegations of drug abuse there. The men&apos;s 100metres is now completely discredited because of the association with steroids. 6. Who were your heroes?  As a girl, I was a member of Birchfield Harriers, who had Kathy Cook, Tessa Sanderson and Sonia Lannaman in their team. Those were some of the finest athletes in the country, so it was great to see them up close. You knew that their path was the one you should follow. 7. Do you still fancy trying out as a TV presenter?  Maybe, though I&apos;ve got two kids now. I did some work for BBC Midlands in 2005 as a sports reporter and presenter. The training was more stressful than any heptathlon. 8. What state is British athletics in?  At the end of my career, I noticed that there weren&apos;t the same calibre of athletes as Steve Backley, Sally Gunnell and Colin Jackson coming through. Being in Singapore in 2005 when London was awarded the 2012 Games was the highlight of my career, after gold in Sydney (I was more nervous in Singapore than I was before the last event in Sydney). But five years will come around very quickly. If we don&apos;t have people on the podium then, our efforts will have been wasted. 9. What do you miss about athletics?  Well, I don&apos;t miss the journalists ... Working towards a goal. You always knew that August was when you had to perform. Doing Strictly Come Dancing in 2004 helped to replicate that. You&apos;d be given five days to work on a routine and then have to perform live in front of the nation. Colin Jackson, who did it in 2005, will tell you that the experience of having been an athlete really helps. 10. Are you still dancing?  When I can. I said I wanted to foxtrot with IOC president Jacques Rogge, but I&apos;m not sure he was so keen. My husband and I did the waltz at our wedding last year and my partner from the series, Ian Waite, coached him beforehand."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/06/theairlineindustry.theobserver", "sentences": ["&apos;That&apos;s a lot of peanuts.&apos; So said Scott Carson, head of Boeing&apos;s commercial airline business, at the thought of flying from Singapore to New York on the latest offering for cost-conscious flyers: the low-cost long-haul carrier.", "Had he made the trip from Boeing HQ in Chicago to London on a no-frills flight - let alone from Singapore to New York - he would not, he suggested, be so sprightly."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-05T23:54:18Z", "title": "Is cheap long-haul  a flight of fancy?", "tags": ["Business", "Airline industry"], "article": "&apos;That&apos;s a lot of peanuts.&apos; So said Scott Carson, head of Boeing&apos;s commercial airline business, at the thought of flying from Singapore to New York on the latest offering for cost-conscious flyers: the low-cost long-haul carrier. Despite jetting in to London overnight from the States, Carson was functioning well last week, making speeches, meeting British Airways boss Willie Walsh to talk about planes. Had he made the trip from Boeing HQ in Chicago to London on a no-frills flight - let alone from Singapore to New York - he would not, he suggested, be so sprightly. So, despite the fact that Ryanair&apos;s Michael O&apos;Leary recently talked of launching a low-cost long-haul operator and has talked to Carson about ordering his long-range, fuel-efficient new 787s, the man from Boeing is not yet convinced. He thinks it&apos;s unlikely travellers will want to make long journeys on bare-minimum services like Ryanair&apos;s, or those of Southwest in the US. There might be a market for low-cost transatlantic flights; any further and some creature comforts will be required. So, while short-haul low-cost carriers underpinned the success of Boeing&apos;s 737 jet, Carson believes the 787 is unlikely to benefit from the same phenomenon. Low-cost airline customers &apos;may make up 10-15 per cent of the total, a few hundred aircraft&apos;, he says. Carson&apos;s guardedness - and it is shared by many analysts - has not prevented a string of launches. There are, despite the doubts, now several operators offering longer routes at low prices. Some of them are even making money. Zoom, for example, was founded in Canada in 2002 by a group of travel industry executives headed by chairman Hugh Boyle. It now flies from eight Canadian cities to five UK airports and Paris. In June, it is launching a Gatwick-New York service for \u00a3129 one way. According to Boyle, Zoom makes a profit on \u00a3150m of turnover. Flyglobespan was started in the same year by Scottish businessman Tom Dalrymple, who runs Globespan, a travel agency. It flies from 13 UK and three Irish airports. Glasgow-Orlando is advertised at \u00a399, Gatwick-Toronto at \u00a349. Last year it made a \u00a34.7m profit - down 24 per cent from the previous year because of spending on new planes. In Asia, Oasis flies from Hong Kong to Gatwick. It advertises flights from \u00a389, going up to \u00a3279 depending on timing and type of ticket. It was launched last year but immediately ran into problems. It was denied access to Russian airspace, which delayed its first flight. None the less, chief executive Stephen Miller says he aims to float in 2009-10, by which time he believes Oasis will be profitable. Meanwhile, Australian carrier Qantas is behind Jetstar, which flies from Australia&apos;s east coast to, among other places, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan. Brisbane-Osaka costs \u00a3100 one way. There are also business-only operators such as Silverjet, which floated last year and started flying from Luton to New York in January using a single Boeing 767 fitted out for just 100 passengers. It offers flat-bed business travel from \u00a3799 return, with an average fare of \u00a3999, compared with the \u00a34,000 &apos;rack rate&apos; from major network carriers. Like Silverjet, most operators are using small numbers of older planes, which are often leased. Oasis, for example, has just two 747s. They all have ambitions, however. Oasis wants to be running 25 planes to 10 destinations within five years, Silverjet to be running 10 planes within three years. And they are ordering ahead. Flyglobespan has ordered two 787s, Jetstar has ordered one, and O&apos;Leary has talked of buying up to 50 787s or the Airbus equivalent, the A350. One leading analyst, Andrew Lobbenberg of ABN Amro, says there are clear openings for these operators. &apos;The network carriers have very high head-office costs, mature staff with difficult working practices, and strong unions - so there is an opportunity to do better on costs.&apos; Moreover, liberalisation in aviation is gathering pace, with the recent EU-US &apos;open skies&apos; agreement loosening restrictions on flying across the Atlantic. O&apos;Leary points to this as a critical factor in his plans. Some parts of the low-cost model are directly transferable to long-haul, such as internet booking and no-frills offerings. Carriers can also focus on secondary airports where fees are cheaper. However, experts are sceptical that the business model can be transplanted exactly. For example, longer journey and turn-around times make it far trickier to draw up efficient timetables than in short-haul operations, where planes can be turned around in half an hour after a one-hour flight and sent back. Moreover, Chris Avery of JP Morgan, another leading analyst, adds that in the current market, with fuel costs as they are, traditional economy fares are hardly covering the expense of transporting the passenger. &apos;You need premium passengers because they more than cover their costs,&apos; he says. Lawrence Hunt, Silverjet&apos;s chief executive, says: &apos;Long-haul is already low cost. We are able to bring our business class fare down to \u00a3999 because we do not have to subsidise economy.&apos; He believes those offering economy-driven services are making money at the high point in the airline business cycle, and may find it harder when the market turns down. Lobbenberg says: &apos;When the low-cost carriers started, it cost you \u00a3250 to get to Milan and back. Now you can get to New York and back for \u00a3250. That does not seem like much of a rip-off.&apos; And he adds: &apos;There seems to be a bit of &quot;me-tooism&quot; in the number of these operators that are around. It&apos;s worth remembering that many of the low-cost carriers went bust.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/07/golf.sport", "sentences": ["The young man tipped for stardom by Nick Faldo after helping Britain and Ireland win the Walker Cup in 2001 looked set to add to his solitary professional success in the 2005 Singapore Masters after a succession of near misses when three clear of the field at the turn.", "Two double bogeys in the last three holes cost him the chance of repeating his Singapore success and in last week&apos;s Spanish Open he failed to break 70 in the last three rounds after leading with a 66."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-06T23:25:31Z", "title": "Golf: Dougherty chokes again", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Nick Dougherty refused to blame a pain in the neck for yet another squandered victory chance in the Italian Open here at Castello di Tolcinasco yesterday. The young man tipped for stardom by Nick Faldo after helping Britain and Ireland win the Walker Cup in 2001 looked set to add to his solitary professional success in the 2005 Singapore Masters after a succession of near misses when three clear of the field at the turn. He was rubbing his neck after a sudden sharp twinge on the 9th but, having sunk a 27ft putt for an eagle three at the 1st and snapped up two birdies to reach the turn in 32, he shrugged off the pain. Instead of a \u00a3193,000 victory, though, he had to settle for joint third and \u00a355,000 as he stumbled down the home straight to end one behind Spain&apos;s Gonzalo Fernandez-Casta\u00f1o, who beat the Austrian Markus Brier in a sudden-death play-off after coming home in 30 - eight strokes better than Dougherty - for a 65. Dougherty, who had hoped to celebrate his 25th birthday 18 days early with a second Tour triumph, admitted: &quot;My back is playing up and my neck is feeling quite stiff. I&apos;m disappointed but I really struggled on the back nine. Basically I just didn&apos;t have the shots. I couldn&apos;t keep the ball in play and had to work hard just to keep it to a couple of errors - technically I just wasn&apos;t there. &quot;Having had so many chances to win doesn&apos;t make it harder. If anything you learn from your experiences. My short game was just fab but every day I&apos;ve hit it a little bit worse. &quot;I was hanging in there but I got really unlucky with a lie and the bogey five there. But these things happen and I&apos;ll just hopefully go on and win one of the big ones back home.&quot; It was brave talk but Dougherty looked a broken man having now had four second-place finishes, four thirds and three fourths in 21 events in which he has been in with a winning chance since 2002. Two double bogeys in the last three holes cost him the chance of repeating his Singapore success and in last week&apos;s Spanish Open he failed to break 70 in the last three rounds after leading with a 66. His undoing in Milan came after he hit tee shots deep into the trees to take six at the 12th, then into water to miss out on a birdie at the long 15th. Fernandez-Casta\u00f1o, winner of the 2005 Dutch Open and 2006 Asian Open, gave himself little chance when he stood on the 10th six behind but, with an eagle and five birdies - and a trip to the water at the 13th - he finished with a 65. Brier then caught him with birdies at the 16th and 17th and parred the last, just missing a 20ft birdie. Fernandez-Costa\u00f1o triumphed with a birdie at the second extra hole."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/10/newatheismencourageswhatitdisavows", "sentences": ["There was one Muslim from Singapore who said the book had actually converted him from belief to atheism - Richard Dawkins will be glad to hear."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-10T10:30:00Z", "title": "New Atheism encourages what it disavows", "tags": ["Religion", "US news", "Atheism", "World news"], "article": "Well, I suppose you could say I asked for it (email me if you have been converted by Richard Dawkins from a believer to an atheist) - and I&apos;ve had plenty of emails. They make interesting reading but the pattern is not one that surprises me hugely. With one exception, my correspondents all said they were agnostic and Dawkins&apos; The God Delusion has made them into atheists. There was one Muslim from Singapore who said the book had actually converted him from belief to atheism - Richard Dawkins will be glad to hear. But for the most part, agnostic to atheist is a significantly different proposition to Dawkins&apos; declared aim of converting religious believers into atheists. So I stand by my conclusion that this genre of New Atheism will not achieve its declared purpose - it will not roll back the rise of a particular form of extremist religious belief which - and here Dawkins and I can agree - is a threat to peace and tolerance. What Dawkins and his fellow atheists do achieve is morale raising among American atheists. Emails and posts portrayed a picture of beleaguered victimhood - of atheists &quot;branded as moral degenerates&quot; for their views, as one email put it. This is how American this debate sounds; I really don&apos;t believe in the UK that atheists are a persecuted minority; the British are pretty phlegmatic about faith, they prefer religion private so no one bothers an atheist or a religious believer unless they insist on banging on about their beliefs. On the other side of the Atlantic, it may well be a different picture and if so, I&apos;d be the first to argue for tolerance and respect for atheism. I don&apos;t much like the kind of political culture such as in America where it is close to impossible to admit you&apos;re an atheist. If Dawkins has helped America to more acceptance of such a position, all to the good. But I also raise the concern that his form of atheism is mimicking the kind of intolerant bigotry we&apos;ve seen in the past from the religious. As one person put it, it&apos;s payback time - atheists are simply giving back what religions have handed out for centuries. Well, exactly. And what&apos;s the point of that? Once you get past a lot of the abuse on Comment is free, there&apos;s an important debate that fascinates people about the nature of religious belief. Faith has clearly failed to explain how the universe works and science has succeeded, but faith hasn&apos;t withered away. As one person put it, &quot;is there only one kind of truth - one that is provable and scientific and that is the one by which religion must be judged&quot; and they concluded by asking &quot;what about other kinds of truth - such as artistic, emotional - which we find valuable and enriching?&quot; What science can&apos;t satisfactorily answer - or express - for many believers and non-believers alike is that search for meaning, human connectedness and elusive human experiences such as peace. Nor does it provide any map for the development of greater insight or compassion. Dawkins may say he finds all that in science - good for him. For many of the rest of us, science doesn&apos;t - and perhaps traditional religion doesn&apos;t either - so we&apos;re still looking. What surprises me - and perhaps by now, it shouldn&apos;t - is how any criticism of Dawkins prompts such a vociferous response. Yet I acknowledged plenty of common ground; much of the political charge sheet of the New Atheists against a Christian fundamentalism in the US is deeply disturbing. I share the New Atheists&apos; horror at the mad beliefs about the second coming and the end of the world; I totally agree that the religious right should not be able to impose their beliefs on science education - intelligent design, creationism and all that hocus pocus. But I differ on tactics, and I do so because it seems to me that extremist religious belief is a peculiarly modern phenomenon driven by the trauma of globalisation and modernity. We need to be much more shrewd about how we handle religious extremism. In many contexts - particularly Islam - it has become a political identity. Religion has re-emerged in the wake of the failure of secular political movements such as communism and socialism. The disorientating pace of social and economic change exacerbates people&apos;s need for security and certainty. Yelling scornful insults at this swelling band of benighted believers will only encourage them to draw the wagons up tighter around the laager."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2007/may/10/lastfmaddsvideo", "sentences": ["The auction services in Hong KOng, Taiwan and Singapore will stay open, as well Yahoo&apos;s other e-commerce sites including classified ads and car sales."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-10T15:34:11Z", "title": "Last.fm adds video", "tags": ["Media", "Digital media", "Last.fm"], "article": "Also: Kevin Rose&apos;s new baby | Archant&apos;s postcode tags | Google Maps | Google Hair | VideoJug&apos;s funding | Yahoo&apos;s ex-auction site | Microsoft&apos;s job site | New London classifieds | Gratuitous link of the day It had to happen: music recommendation site Last.fm is moving in to video. The site recommends music based on what you like: enter &quot;Tom Waits&quot; and its database of (at least) 6 billion pieces of information gathered from its users will suggest that you probably also like Nick Drake and Lou Reed. You can download their desktop app and it will create your own personalised radio station based on what you listen to, and what it thinks you&apos;ll like. The different here is that Last.fm&apos;s recommendations are based on the listening habits of its users, rather than what some wonky-haired, tight be-jeaned muso thinks you&apos;d like. Anyway, the same process is being applied to video, so users get music videos as well as songs. Videos will be better quality than YouTube and will initially focus on the indie labels: Ninja Tune, Warp, Atlantic, Mute, Domino and Nettwerk Music Group. The rather modest ambition is to get the site to include every music video ever, to o be the MTV of the internet (Viacom will love that - not) and to tap the &quot;long tail&quot; for music videos. MTV currently rotates the same 2,000, co-founder Martin Stiksel told Wired, but I swear when you watch it it feels more like 20. Last.fm&apos;s Christian Ward said the first videos would probably be on the site next week, and the recommendation around the videos would be added later. For now, the priority is to attract as much high-quality video as possible. And there&apos;s plenty more tricks coming from these guys.

It&apos;s all very secret squirrel at the moment, says Om Malik, kind of, but should launch later this month. Rose is working with fellow Digger Daniel Burka and entrepreneur Leah Culver - I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s her of the etched-laptop fame. Kevin will probably still be working on Digg and also Revision 3, and both of those were funded by Greylock Partners.

The revamped localised sites will launch in August or September, starting with the Norwich Evening News.

Signalling his intention to take charge of the world championship contest, Alonso made the most of the development work he had completed during last week&apos;s test at the track near Barcelona to lap his McLaren-Mercedes 0.2sec faster than the Renault R27s of Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen. The pursuing pair briefly distorted the overall competitive picture by doing runs on a very low fuel load in the closing moments of the second 90-minute session. Yet ignoring the hard mathematics of this challenging track where a reduction of 10kg in fuel load translates to a lap time improvement of 0.3sec, Alonso served notice of his credentials while emphasising to Lewis Hamilton, fifth in yesterday&apos;s second session, that he has no intention of surrendering his de facto team leadership in the McLaren squad. &quot;It was a great start to my home grand prix with a trouble-free Friday practice,&quot; said Alonso. &quot;We went through the usual programme of tyre evaluation and set-up work, but had a pretty good handling balance early on. We have definitely improved the car since Bahrain. I look forward to the rest of the weekend and really want to do my best for all the supporters.&quot; As for the Ferrari team, Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen ended the day fourth and sixth, but both are confident they can challenge for pole in this afternoon&apos;s qualifying session. Competing in one&apos;s home grand prix either makes or breaks a driver&apos;s resolve. Ayrton Senna always reckoned that the stimulus of racing in front of his home crowd could be worth up to half a second a lap while Nigel Mansell felt additionally empowered by the &quot;Mansell-mania&quot; that roared from the grandstands during his victories in 1991 and 92. Rubens Barrichello, Honda team-mate to Jenson Button, said: &quot;When I was new to formula one early in my career I used to find competing in my home grand prix was a slightly intimidating experience. But as I grew in experience all the support of the home crowd helped lift me and I&apos;m sure it will be the same for Fernando here in Spain this weekend.&quot; Niki Lauda, who only once managed to win his home grand prix in Austria, agreed up to a point with Barrichello&apos;s assessment, but made the point that constant attention from people you only see once a year at your home race can add to the pressure. &quot;It was always very tempting for me to fly back to Vienna after I had finished practising at the Osterreichring just to get away from the relentless pressure and all the competition for your time,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s obviously great to have the support of your home crowd, but it does bring with it its own sort of pressure. Having said that, I think that Fernando has what it takes to handle whatever pressure is thrown at him.&quot; Singapore will be the next venue on the formula one trail in 2008 when it is scheduled to hold its first grand prix, which may be the first championship event to be held under floodlights at night to dovetail with peak European TV viewing slots."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/12/healthandwellbeing.features3", "sentences": ["I lived in Singapore for 16 years.", "In Singapore, some feng shui masters tilted the door of a hotel 15 degrees."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-12T22:58:03Z", "title": "Are you happy?

Given the intense expectation surrounding Hamilton&apos;s every move, it was assumed that pole position would be a matter of course. Formula One is not that simple, as demonstrated by the three-tenths of a second covering the first four on the grid. But Hamilton did not reflect the anticlimax felt in some uninformed quarters as he weighed up the pros and cons of equalling his qualifying performance in two of the first three races. Hamilton had the look of someone who could explain the superior pace of his McLaren team-mate, Fernando Alonso, if not the pair of Ferraris starting first and third. As qualifying unfolded yesterday, it became clear that it was Alonso rather than Hamilton who might take pole, despite Hamilton having been consistently quicker during free practice. The suggestion - unofficially confirmed by Hamilton&apos;s lack of concern over his qualifying performance - was that Alonso had chosen to run with less fuel on board in order to win pole for his home grand prix and gain a psychological edge. &apos;I&apos;m satisfied with today&apos;s qualifying and believe that I have a strong race strategy,&apos; said Hamilton. &apos;Anything is possible from the second row and we have been quick throughout the weekend. I&apos;ve started fourth on a few occasions now, so I have an idea of what to do. I&apos;m really pleased with the car and the improvements made since Bahrain. Being second and fourth, both Fernando and I will be on the dirty side of the track, but I think we have shown so far this year that it&apos;s not too much of a disadvantage. I&apos;m really looking forward to another exciting race.&apos; Alonso&apos;s plans were thwarted in the closing seconds of qualifying when Felipe Massa, never in the serious reckoning until this point, produced another of his exceptional laps to claim his third successive pole for Ferrari. When Alonso came to a halt at the end of the pit lane, his arrival was greeted in comparative silence by the Spanish faithful, a stark contrast to the scene of near-hysteria last year when the world champion stood on his car and welcomed the adulation after destroying the opposition. This time, Alonso was more bemused than bothered. &apos;To be honest, it is a nice surprise to be at the front of the grid,&apos; said Alonso. &apos;I understand the silence because this is the first time at a grand prix for a lot of the spectators. They have to understand that qualifying is only the start of the weekend. The race could be a different story. The way things are, any one of the first four drivers on the grid could win.It&apos;s that close.&apos; Alonso will be hoping that today&apos;s 66-lap encounter is a different story from the previous race in Bahrain, where Hamilton as well as the Ferraris beat him handsomely. Alonso may have won the opening skirmish with his team-mate yesterday but he is aware that the Ferraris, after appearing to be slightly off the pace, found form when it mattered most. &apos;I thought, after my first quick lap, that I could keep pole during my final run,&apos; said Alonso. &apos;The Ferrari was faster in the end but I would rather be second than third. I&apos;m quite happy.&apos; Massa achieved the double when his effort also caught Kimi Raikkonen by surprise and helped relegate the Finn to the second row. Massa&apos;s best time, a mere three-hundredths of a second faster than Alonso over the 2.9-mile lap, was clinical in its perfection, unlike Raikkonen&apos;s best effort that, by his own admission, was untidy due to a continuing struggle to gain total confidence in the Ferrari after his move from McLaren at the beginning of the season. There may be 13 races remaining after this one - including the British Grand Prix on 8 July - but the talk in the paddock has been of Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s methods when deciding next year&apos;s schedule. The F1 boss has come under severe criticism from the Spanish government for suggesting that a proposed race through the streets of Valencia is dependent on victory for the governing Popular Party in the forthcoming municipal elections. Ecclestone has claimed he was misunderstood but, whatever the political posturing, it seems certain the Valencia event, along with a night race in Singapore, will help swell the 2008 calendar to 20 races for the first time. The Silverstone race will have its traditional slot next year, but not for much longer if Ecclestone carries out his threat to discontinue dealing with the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club (BRDC), the owners of Silverstone. With promoters from far and wide queuing for the right to hold a grand prix, Ecclestone can afford to be choosy at the expense of one of the most popular races thanks to what appears to be the inflexible and sometimes arrogant attitude of the BRDC. Given the burgeoning success of Lewis Hamilton, Ecclestone&apos;s bargaining hand has been strengthened further."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/20/china.theobserver", "sentences": ["The plan seems to be to model the fund on Singapore&apos;s GIC fund or the fund that invests a proportion of Norway&apos;s oil revenues and now stands at around $88,000 for every Norwegian."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-19T23:33:03Z", "title": "Money to burn: here comes the Chinese wall of investment", "tags": ["Business", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "A $250bn fund (\u00a3125bn) could buy the GDP of Greece, a handful of the less secure African economies or finance the takeover of HSBC. It is unlikely that the Chinese authorities have any such ambitious projects in mind for their new state foreign investment fund, which is likely to be launched later this year, but $250bn it will have available to invest will make it a far more powerful force in the market than any of these individual countries. China is suffering from an embarrassment of riches. As the &apos;factory&apos; servicing the world&apos;s consumers it has, literally, been manufacturing money. At the last count, its foreign exchange reserves were more than $1 trillion and are growing by $50m a month. Historically, China has parked the funds safely in US Treasuries - government bonds - diversifying recently into European equivalents. But earlier this year, it announced that it would set up a fund to invest some of these billions and there is already considerable debate and speculation over where this will be. China has not released any details - including the size of the fund, although $250bn seems to be the best guess. It is expected to be administered by Lou Jiwei, until recently a vice-minister at the finance department, and there are suggestions that external fund mangers have been approached about running some of the portfolio. The plan seems to be to model the fund on Singapore&apos;s GIC fund or the fund that invests a proportion of Norway&apos;s oil revenues and now stands at around $88,000 for every Norwegian. The key worry is, however, that if the Chinese decide to be more adventurous with their money, the move could further weaken an already listless US dollar. Michael Hughes, chief investment officer at Barings Asset Management, thinks any impact on the dollar would take a long time to show through. &apos;They will not necessarily be selling dollars to buy other assets,&apos; he adds. Indeed, China will be anxious not to weaken the dollar to avoid taking losses on its existing investments. When the Japanese had a current account surplus in the 1980s, the wall of money pushed up prices of everything from Manhattan lofts through to Scottish gold courses to French impressionists and, ultimately, it is possible that China&apos;s money will have a similar impact. Philip Ehrmann, who runs Jupiter&apos;s China fund, thinks China is likely to use the fund to support the aims of its businesses - buying things like resources, technology and high quality management which it currently lacks. It may not find it easy, however: the US has already thwarted Chinese bids for its own oil companies while Canada and Australia are also concerned about too much Chinese involvement. While it has a free run in Africa, where it is already the biggest foreign investor, there is a limit to what is available to buy there. Ian Beattie, head of Asian investments at New Star, thinks that the recent decision to allow Chinese retail investors to buy overseas equities as well as bonds will have as much impact as the new state fund . Within the next decade, expect all markets to have turned much more Chinese."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/20/newmedia.business", "sentences": ["Up pops &apos;sparklette&apos; from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-20T09:47:30Z", "title": "John Naughton: Here's a thought.

He describes the expression on the face of a chap who &apos;while picking daisies on the down line, has just received the 4.15 in the small of the back&apos;. Well, I saw that expression this week. It crossed the visage of a friend who is a grizzled veteran of the print business, a man who was once deputy editor of one of our more disgraceful national newspapers. No more cynical observer of human depravity can therefore be imagined. But he was, for an instant, genuinely taken aback. What caused this astonishment was a casual mention of Twitter (twitter.com), a current online sensation. My friend had clearly never heard of it, so we explained that it was a web service that enables people to publish short (140 characters maximum) messages telling the world what they are thinking about or doing at any particular moment. His jaw dropped as the sheer pointlessness of the notion struck home. While he was recovering, one of my colleagues used his mobile phone to post a &apos;tweet&apos; (as Twitter messages are called) telling the world that &apos;John is explaining Twitter to Bob&apos;. We then added to his pain by telling him about Twittervision (twittervision.com), a clever mash-up created by David Troy that superimposes messages from the Twitter rolling log onto a map of the world provided by Google Maps. I&apos;m just looking at it now. Up pops &apos;sparklette&apos; from Singapore. &apos;You are the cutest and most precious thing ever!&apos; she or he burbles. &apos;Do you know that?&apos; Next up is &apos;sasame3&apos; in Japan, saying something incomprehensible (to this columnist). Here&apos;s &apos;JamFactory&apos; from Bristol saying &apos;Thanks bro, it&apos;s Soooo close, another hour or so maybe!&apos; And just when I thought there was nothing happening in Indonesia, up pops &apos;herdiansah&apos;, who is clearly grappling with technology. &apos;kenapa sih font dax medium ini kalo di Flash IDE nggak bisa ... sementara di Photoshop bisa ... any clue?&apos; And so on. It&apos;s important to remember that these particular tweets are not part of any conversation. They&apos;re simply the product of individuals typing answers to Twitter.com&apos;s question: &apos;What are you doing?&apos; (The correct answer, of course, would be &apos;typing something into Twitter&apos;, but we will let that pass.) And although Twitter is not the only service of this kind, it&apos;s the one that has become the sensation de nos jours. Why? It&apos;s partly because Twitter is modestly - but not dangerously - wacky. It provides a subtle way of letting friends and colleagues know that they shouldn&apos;t have written you off as a technophobe. And it&apos;s easy to use. You don&apos;t even have to be logged in to the net - tweets can be sent and received using mobile phones. The obvious downside is that, in a world when busy people are already besieged by electronic stimuli, it just adds to the cacophony. Do I really want to know that one of my friends is &apos;thinking about feeding the cat&apos;, or that another is &apos;pondering a witty blog post&apos;? It raises the problem of what psychologists call &apos;constant partial attention&apos;. &apos;How can I focus on a task or simply think about a problem&apos;, asks one thoughtful blogger, &apos;when I am constantly updating people on my status and receiving updates on theirs? The answer is I can&apos;t focus and I don&apos;t think others can either. A state of continuous partial attention is not a good thing. We need to think deeply at times and focus.&apos; Amen. And yet twittering has its defenders too. Some people find it reassuring to know what their friends are doing or thinking about. It gives them a feeling of being connected to their social network without having to read blogs or send email. And there&apos;s no obligation to reply to a tweet. So is it a passing fad? It&apos;s too early to say. We still don&apos;t know the business model of the companies who provide the service. Will it eventually be overwhelmed by corporate messages or spam? Will employers start monitoring tweets (many of which are sent during office hours)? Who knows?

The first clue comes at about 4.30am when a low, distant drone slowly becomes audible - but only when there&apos;s a westerly wind. It&apos;s the first plane of the day - typically a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - passing at around 4,000ft over my home in south London on its approach to Heathrow airport. It still has eight minutes and 20 miles to fly before it touches down, but by the time it passes overhead the whine of its jet engines is responsible for the 48 decibels of aircraft-related sleep disturbance that the law allows. Just a few minutes or so later, another aircraft will follow in its wake. And another, and another. In total, Heathrow airport - the world&apos;s busiest - manages a daily average of nearly 1,300 aircraft movements. Like all airports, it uses the direction of the wind to determine which way aircraft will approach its runways, as it is safer for a plane to descend into a head wind. Sometimes, as I lie awake at night counting planes instead of sheep, I wonder where each passenger passing over me has just come from. Are they returning from a holiday? Is this their first time visiting Britain? Are they, like me when I go somewhere for the first time, both apprehensive and excited about arriving in a new country and new city? And then I move on to the consequences of all these journeys. How much fuel is needed to fly 60 tonnes of aircraft through the air for many hundreds, if not thousands, of miles? Is flying hundreds of millions of people around the world each year for their holidays really sustainable? And what of the destinations and the people who live there? What impact are all these arrivals having? Fifteen per cent of the UK population now go on three or more flights abroad each year. In 2005, Britons made 66.4 million visits abroad - an all-time record and three times the amount in 1984 - with 81% of those journeys made by air, according to the Office of National Statistics. Two-thirds of all those journeys were made by people going on holiday. And the figures just get bigger as you gaze into the future. When the UK government published a white paper in 2003 aiming to set out the country&apos;s aviation needs for the next 30 years, it predicted that the UK&apos;s airports would need to be able to handle between 350 and 460 million passengers by 2020. That&apos;s two to three times the amount in 2002, and at least 10 times the 1970 figure. Incredibly, it estimated that one-fifth of the world&apos;s international passengers are on flights to or from a UK airport. Aviation demand is not just taking off, it&apos;s soaring out of sight - and the bulk of this future demand is going to be driven by tourists. International tourism, according to the United Nations&apos; World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), is now the world&apos;s largest export earner. It has also become one of the world&apos;s most important sources of employment. Tourism, if you believe UNWTO, is the knight on a charger that could ride forth to save the underprivileged peoples of the world, who should be taking full advantage of the fact that many of them live in places where the world&apos;s rich want to holiday - either sun-drenched, pristine beaches, or countries offering that sought-after cultural &quot;other&quot;. In short, there is a sustainable, healthy living to be made by helping foreign tourists gain temporary sanctuary from the mundane routines of their day-to-day lives. This sounds wonderful in theory, but is tourism really such a global force for good? I decided to visit some of the destinations we all love to go to, places that represent the trends and pressures of global tourism today: climate change, demographic shifts, the maturation and sophistication of holidaying tastes, the widening partition between the world&apos;s wealthy and poor. This is what I wanted to know: what effect does our footfall have on places that are environmentally and ecologically sensitive? How much do the resident communities really have to gain economically from our stay? Above all, just where, as tourists, are we heading, both literally and metaphorically? Tallinn, Estonia Tallinn has been something of a soft touch for invading hordes over the centuries. Just about every nation or clan that borders the Baltic Sea has at one time or another approached the city&apos;s imposing, yet clearly breachable walls - Vikings, Danes, Swedes, Poles, Nazis and Soviets. Poignant dates litter this small country&apos;s history: 1346, when the city was sold by the Danes to the Teutonic Order; March 9 1944, when the Nazi-held city was bombed remorselessly by the Soviets throughout the night; August 20 1991, when Estonia finally regained independence from the Soviets after the so-called Singing Revolution. But a more recent date may come to be noted as a turning point for the city - October 31 2004. This was when the first easyJet flight from Britain landed at Tallinn&apos;s airport. Some feel the city has never been the same since. For around \u00a340 each way, the journey to Tallinn&apos;s medieval old town - a Unesco world heritage site - became instantly affordable to Britons. The state airline, Estonian Air, soon dropped its prices to compete. Before this date, most Britons visiting the city were over 50 and largely interested in culture and architecture. Beyond Tallinn itself, other attractions proved popular: the limestone cliffs at Ontika; the coastal spa town of P\u00e4rnu; the forested and bog-filled nature reserves; and the large islands of Hiiumaa and Saaremaa to the west. But since Tallinn became cheaper to reach it has joined the ranks of European cities that each weekend have to deal with sometimes hundreds of drunk, leery men , singing and stumbling their way from bar to strip club in search of alcohol and sex, under the banner of the stag party. Of all these cities, Tallinn is seen to be particularly vulnerable to this form of tourism as, unlike the bigger cities that these &quot;staggers&quot; head to, the downtown area is little more than a mile wide. In such a small space, the staggers more than make their presence felt. In the shadow of Toompea Castle, just 10 minutes&apos; walk from the city&apos;s medieval heart, I am breakfasting on ham, cheese and rye bread while behind me three British men in their late 30s - the first to emerge from bed out of a group of staggers a dozen strong - talk about the night before. &quot;You&apos;ve got a McDonald&apos;s, bars and a strip club on one street. What more could you want?&quot; asks one. Another switches on his digital camera and begins to show his friends some photographs taken the night before. &quot;She&apos;s a cracker, isn&apos;t she? I&apos;m going to ring her tonight. I think I&apos;m in love.&quot; At the next table, a middle-aged couple from Germany tut under their breath. Later, as the sun drops beneath the city walls, Tallinn&apos;s old town begins to swell with tourists looking for an evening meal. Many congregate first in the bars that line the town square, where the only original Gothic town hall in northern Europe still stands, unchanged since 1429. Within a few hundred metres are most of the bars and clubs frequented by the staggers, with beers on tap and live football on big screens. All of them are packed with men shouting at the screens, singing en masse, or sinking pints. Within a few hours many of them will be making their way to the strip clubs and nightclubs near by. Just five minutes&apos; walk away, I meet Dr Nelli Kalikova in the lobby of the 1930s Scandic Palace Hotel. From 1996 to 2003 she was the head of Estonia&apos;s Aids prevention centre, before deciding to enter politics as a member of parliament. She is outspoken about the rise of these stag parties and, in particular, the fact that a visit to the city&apos;s prostitutes is often part of their itinerary. &quot;The men on stag parties drink like pigs,&quot; she says. &quot;They come here just to buy sex. About 30% of the girls&apos; clients refuse to wear condoms. They pay more for this &apos;privilege&apos;, or they do tricks like pulling it off at the last minute. It is kamikaze sex.&quot; Kalikova says there is a 5% infection rate among the prostitutes in the city when it comes to HIV/Aids, but this is increasing as more and more of the women become drug addicts. And she is convinced that staggers don&apos;t know the risks they are taking. A survey of prostitutes that was conducted in 2005 by the Estonian Institute for Open Society Research paints a picture far worse than even Kalikova suggested: one in every five prostitutes surveyed tested positive for HIV and one in five also suffered from &quot;uncured venereal diseases&quot;. At least 85% of the prostitutes were 30 or under. The stag trips both greatly swell demand and lend a veneer of acceptability to the fact that many of the prostitutes and &quot;dancers&quot; are women trafficked across borders by criminal gangs. Bangkok and Ko Phi Phi, Thailand &quot;We&apos;re just back from China and Tibet,&quot; says Sara. &quot;And before that we were in Ko Pha Ngan for a month.&quot; In the past couple of decades the small island of Ko Pha Ngan in the Gulf of Thailand has become a Mecca for the more hedonistic, party-seeking traveller, a place sold as an alternative to the mass-tourism haunts of southern Thailand such as Phuket and Koh Samui. I am chatting with Sara and Matt on a corner of Bangkok&apos;s Khao San road, a thoroughfare that ranks as one of the world&apos;s major backpacker hubs, attracting hundreds of thousands of travellers a year. They first met in Bangkok a few years ago and now spend periods working intensively at home in Canada to fund their next trip. Sara, 30, first went to Ko Pha Ngan about 10 years ago. &quot;But there are ATMs and 7-11s there now,&quot; she says. &quot;Plus, there are more parties. It used just to be the Full Moon Party on Hat Rin beach, but now there are Black Moon parties and even Half Moon parties. There&apos;s a party every week, basically. The party used to be just on the beach, but now there are jungle parties with dancefloors actually built within the jungle. But I always stay with &apos;my family&apos; when I&apos;m there. They&apos;re a local family that I spent months with when I first visited.&quot; Matt, 27, says change is happening everywhere they&apos;ve been. What, I ask them, is the main backpacker &quot;route&quot; in south-east Asia nowadays? &quot;Everyone is doing the Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam-Laos circuit now,&quot; says Sara. &quot;No one is doing the overland route from Bali to Bangkok, through Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, any more because of the Bali bombings [of 2002 and 2005]. Laos is like Thailand 10 years ago. It&apos;s the best. There&apos;s a weird place called Vang Vien on the Mekong river. Backpackers sit in rubber inner tubes drinking bhang lassi [a cannabis-laced yoghurt drink that originates in India] and float down the river to bars along the banks where there are TV screens showing The Simpsons and Friends. It&apos;s like being the Swiss Family Robinson, but with beer.&quot; Sara says that from what she&apos;s seen - this is her eighth trip to Thailand - the relationship between backpackers and host communities is getting more and more fraught. There is simply an ever-growing number of backpackers, plus a more diverse range of nationalities, now on the road. On this trip for the first time she&apos;s met Mexican, Indian, Brazilian and Argentinian backpackers. &quot;The locals just seem more tired and cynical these days, especially here in Thailand. I get embarrassed by backpackers yelling at people and speaking down to them. In India and Vietnam travellers always feel they&apos;re being ripped off. We are really blessed to be able to come travelling. But many people don&apos;t think like this any more.&quot; The mourning of a paradise lost, combined with a belief that they alone have experienced the true essence of a destination, is still common among tourists today, but particularly among backpackers, predominantly young travellers taking time out before the leaden responsibilities of adulthood to muse on their future life through the prism of other cultures. This is the script, anyway. But is their journey really little more than convenient cover for one long party under the sun? Even among the voices who speak up in defence of backpacking - as a group sowing the seeds of a global community, and spending money chiefly with local small business along the way - few disagree that backpackers act as &quot;wedges&quot; for tourism to develop in a location. Once backpackers have &quot;found&quot; a place, there is little turning back. Where they lead, others almost inevitably follow. My route from Bangkok to Ko Phi Phi - the isolated islands where The Beach was filmed in 1998 and that remain a backpacker magnet today - takes me through Phuket, Thailand&apos;s biggest island. For many it is a crystal-ball view of what Ko Phi Phi will become: a place of once pristine beach areas that has suffered unchecked development. Ko Phi Phi and Phuket are also part of the much wider area so gravely damaged by Asia&apos;s 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The ferry from Phuket to the island cluster of Ko Phi Phi takes nearly two hours. My boat joins five others to form a stretched-out flotilla across the warm Andaman Sea. As we pass the iconic giant limestone karsts that pepper these waters, reaching 100m or more into the air, I sit on the bow counting jellyfish and plastic water bottles bobbing together on the sea&apos;s surface. Around me a hundred or so other tourists, a mixture of backpackers and a large Chinese group, top up their tans. I&apos;ve purchased a ticket to the main island of Ko Phi Phi Don, which includes in the price an excursion to its neighbouring smaller sister, Ko Phi Phi Le, where all visitors want to see Maya Bay, a truly picture-perfect cove where Leonardo DiCaprio and others were filmed in The Beach acting out the story of a backpacker community that sought an untouched, off-the-map tropical island all to themselves. But when the boat finally pulls round the high cliff, we find the cove congested with other boats. I count 27 in total - some speedboats, some large passenger boats such as mine - and one of the crew tells me there can be twice this number in high season. The water glistens with a diesel sheen as the crew throw down the anchor. Everyone is offered a snorkel and we are told we have half an hour to spend swimming in the cove before the boat will leave for the main pier at Ko Phi Phi Don. Once I am in the water, it is evident just how lifeless the coral beneath the waves is, though the area lies within Ang Thong national marine park. Someone from our boat swims over to a tiny, empty cove, walk over to a large rock, and leave his mark by urinating against it. As we climb back aboard and passengers dry themselves off, I watch on as discarded watermelon skins, plastic cups and cigarette butts all make their way into the sea. It seems ironic that, at the time, the director of The Beach, Danny Boyle, said: &quot;We got a chance to speak for Thailand, to tell these westerners to go home and stop treating it like a playground.&quot; It&apos;s a short ride to Ko Phi Phi Don. As we travel towards the pier, there is little sign of the damage caused by the tsunami that swept twice over the island&apos;s double-crescent beach, killing more than 700 people. But once off the boat, it becomes evident how much reconstruction is going on. There is also much that is of questionable taste - before-and-after tsunami postcards and &quot;Still Alive&quot; tsunami T-shirts are on sale in shops. Amid the bars, restaurants and shops serving the large throng of backpackers - most of whom are walking around in bikinis or swimming shorts, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the islanders are predominantly Muslim - I meet up with Andrew Hewett, a Briton who runs the Adventure Club dive shop and has lived on the island since 1994 with his Thai wife and their two children. He orchestrated a huge effort by hundreds of volunteer divers to clean the islands&apos; waters of the many tonnes of rubbish that were washed out to sea during the tsunami. He is also one of the most vocal critics of how environmentally damaging the tourism industry has become on these sensitive islands. Hewett has been offering diving and snorkelling trips for years and knows the various reefs around the islands intimately. &quot;The tsunami didn&apos;t actually do that much lasting damage to the reef,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s the tourists who do the real damage. Eighty per cent of divers contact the reef three to five times per dive. Some reefs I knew six years ago have been totally destroyed by people standing on them.&quot; Hewett is proud of the response by many backpackers to the tsunami. Hundreds of volunteers flocked to the islands to offer assistance in the clean-up; many had stayed here before and said they felt an affinity to the place. But he feels this effort is overshadowed by the impact of tourism, even though he readily admits his role in oiling the cogs of change. In 2000, he started offering &quot;shark watch&quot; day trips; soon all the other operators copied him and now it is a &quot;must-do&quot; among the backpackers. Then he came up with the idea of cliff-jumping and mountain-trekking trips, which again were soon copied. &quot;I have to be careful what I offer now, as sometimes I have 30 people in boats following me to see where we&apos;ve gone and what we&apos;re doing. I&apos;m trying to set up a sustainable tourism campaign on the island, but it is very difficult.&quot; Perhaps reducing numbers by increasing prices is the right thing to do? But what is a &quot;fair&quot; price for the privilege of being able to stay here - the few dollars backpackers pay, or the hundreds luxury resorts would charge? If that isn&apos;t a fair way to restrict access, then what is the alternative? In 2006, the Centre for Future Studies, a British thinktank, put forward the idea that some of the most vulnerable tourist destinations on Earth, such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, Athens, Italy&apos;s Amalfi coast, Croatia&apos;s Dalmatian coast, Kathmandu and Florida&apos;s Everglades, should be restricted to visitors who have won entrance tickets in an annual worldwide lottery. It would raise both money and limit visitors. Furthermore, it would be equitable and would presumably attract the most passionate of visitors. In small, super-sensitive destinations such as Ko Phi Phi, perhaps this would be a sensible idea to explore. It is certainly questionable just how long they will last otherwise \u00b7 Extracted from The Final Call, by Leo Hickman.  \u00b7 The Final Call is published on June 4 by Eden Projects Books in association with Guardian Books at \u00a312.99.

Cycling in the Netherlands All holidays should clock up as few emissions as is humanly possible, and transport doesn&apos;t get much greener than cycling. Due to the fast-expanding Sustrans National Cycle Network, cycling holidays in Britain are already popular, but for the novice the polders and lowlands of the Netherlands - easily accessible by ferry or train from the UK - offer a gentle, near hill-free introduction to the joys of pedal power. www.holland.com/uk/special/cycling Sailing the west coast of Scotland There&apos;s no point sailing if a lack of wind requires you to rely on a putt-putt outboard motor for your entire holiday. Thankfully, the one thing the west coast of Scotland rarely lacks is wind. Combine that with some of the most striking coastal scenery in the world and you have the perfect sailing holiday. Just remember to support the local economy by frequenting the pubs, shops and eateries instead of always eating on board. sail.visitscotland.com Walking in the Alps With many of the lower ski resorts predicted to have closed within a generation due to fast-rising snowlines, some within the Alpine tourism industry are now desperately seeking alternative sources of income. Summer walking holidays through Alpine meadows and over mountain passes have been popular for decades, but there is renewed interest in them today. High-speed rail links to the Alps are ever improving, too. www.alpseurope.com Camping in Normandy Camping is currently enjoying a strong revival, especially for those with children. The British Isles are covered with excellent places to camp from Cornwall to the Cairngorms, but even cheaper alternatives lie just a ferry or train journey away in mainland Europe. Popular twists on the theme include camping in teepees on farmland. www.campingfrance.com Home-stay in Morocco Morocco is (just) within reach by train, but you really do have to sign up to the travellers&apos; philosophy that the journey should be part of the holiday, too, if you don&apos;t mind spending two days on a train with a short stop-off in, say, Madrid. Even if you fly, Morocco offers plenty of opportunity to stay in places that truly benefit the local economy as well as minimising your environmental impact.

And he is outraged by US trade relations with what he continually calls &quot;communist China&quot;. As Ms Wu will find, China-bashing plays well in America. The biggest charge against the People&apos;s Republic is that it keeps its currency weak to make it easier for Chinese exporters to sell their goods abroad. The result, the Americans claim, is that US manufacturers are sinking, taking jobs with them. Exhibit A for the prosecution is China&apos;s trade surplus. In the 12 months to March, China sold $242bn more in goods to the US than it bought in return. No wonder that ahead of this week&apos;s talks with the US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, Beijing announced $4.3bn-worth of deals with American firms. It also weakened the Chinese currency a tad. Neither measure will buy Washington off. The yuan will remain a particular sore point since, on some estimates, it is 40% weaker against the dollar than it should be. Beijing can argue back. Their country&apos;s poor are greater in number than the entire US population so China cannot match America&apos;s spending power. And the US is being defensive, just as it used to be against Japan. That era&apos;s equivalent of Lou Dobbs was the film Rising Sun, which portrayed dastardly Japanese businessmen murdering their way to the commanding heights of US industry. Only this time the political elite is no longer sure of free trade&apos;s merits. Rising Sun, for instance, was released in 1993, just as Congress backed with a resounding majority the Nafta deal, which created a free-trade zone between the US, Canada and Mexico. That deal&apos;s modern-day equivalent is Cafta, an agreement between Washington and central American countries. This time it squeaked through by one vote. Bill Clinton was a cheerleader for free trade, but modern Democrats worry about its impact on jobs. Tony Blair may have vowed yesterday to get back on track the World Trade Organisation&apos;s latest negotiations, which began in Doha in 2001 and ran aground soon after, but he looks an increasingly lonely figure on the centre-left. The same shift is going on among America&apos;s intelligentsia. Paul Krugman, the economist who is to free trade what Nick Hornby is to football, recently told an audience at the LSE that he was having doubts.

Yet whereas Manchester City reached a clear-cut view three weeks ago that Barton&apos;s alleged assault on his team-mate Ousmane Dabo was unacceptable, the club are struggling to form a rounded opinion of the man currently dangling \u00a3100m before their eyes. It is not difficult to find the huge questions swirling around Thaksin and his money. Google his name and you find two strands of daily news. The first is his proposed bid for City, the fairy-tale solution for a beleaguered club - he would buy City for about \u00a327m, repay the major shareholders John Wardle and David Makin their \u00a320m loans and provide a mooted \u00a350m for players. The other chronicles the eight-month investigation in Thailand into alleged corruption during his five years as prime minister, which is shortly expected to deliver the first criminal charges against him. The proceedings follow the ousting of Thaksin by a military government in a bloodless coup in September 2006 after allegations of corruption and cronyism and mass demonstrations against him in Bangkok. After taking power, the military government set up an Assets Examination Committee to inquire into the allegations and examine the fortunes made by Thaksin, his wife Pojaman and their family. Last Monday, as Thaksin, who is living in exile in London, was stepping up his proposed bid for City, Pojaman was pleading not guilty in Bangkok&apos;s Criminal Court to charges of tax evasion and perjury arising out of a transfer of shares in the family&apos;s telecommunications company, Shin Corp, in 1997. Two of the couple&apos;s children have been hit with a tax bill for $789m (\u00a3400m), which the authorities claim is due from the sale of Shin Corp in January last year. That sale vastly increased Thaksin&apos;s wealth but led also to his political undoing. Having been elected by a landslide in 2001 and re-elected in 2005, his government was credited with introducing some major advances including more affordable healthcare for the Thai poor but he was increasingly dogged by allegations that he was running the country in ways which financially benefited himself, his family and associates. The anti-corruption organisation Transparency International, in its 2006 report on Thailand, said of the country under Thaksin: &quot;Corrupt activities have become highly sophisticated, including conflicts of interest and policy-based corruption. Despite some successes, Thaksin was alleged of [sic] having absolute power, corruption, conflicts of interest, violation of human rights and using inappropriate populist policies to win the rural poor.&quot; There are longstanding allegations of brutality and extrajudicial killings carried out by the Thai police and army in Thaksin&apos;s 2003 &quot;war on drugs&quot; and when putting down an insurgency by Malay Muslims in the south. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International accused his government of failing adequately to investigate the killings, which he denied. Then, in January 2006, Thaksin&apos;s government passed a law which removed a 25% limit on foreign ownership of Thai telecommunications companies. Days later he sold Shin Corp to the Singapore-owned Temasek Corporation, making $1.9bn (\u00a3960m). The prime minister and his family structured the sale so that they paid no tax, which further infuriated opinion in Bangkok and led to massive demonstrations on the streets. An investigation by Thailand&apos;s Securities and Exchange Commission decided there was no illegality, but the country fell into crisis. Thaksin called elections in April 2006 which the main opposition parties boycotted and which were eventually ruled invalid. In September the military seized power. This month the Assets Examination Committee investigators recommended that prosecutors charge Thaksin over a 2003 sale of land in Bangkok, which was owned by a fund attached to the Bank of Thailand. The investigators allege that Thaksin, then prime minister, was responsible for it and so had a conflict of interest - it was sold to his wife. Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Noppadon Pattama, has denied that Thaksin did anything illegal and said the former prime minister would fight charges if the case went ahead. Seymour Pierce, the merchant bank representing Shinawatra&apos;s bid, maintains that none of this affects the advisability of selling Manchester City to him. It dismisses the proceedings against him because they have been brought by a military government, which is undemocratic and not recognised by the British government. A spokesman for Seymour Pierce, which stands to make considerable fees if the deal goes ahead, said Thaksin&apos;s record had been considered: &quot;The information we have is that Thaksin was a successful and popular prime minister who was removed by a military coup. There are strict rules on money laundering and politically exposed persons, and we and all the professional advisers are satisfied we are able to act for Thaksin Shinawatra.&quot; City promote an identity as a community club, proclaiming themselves &quot;Pure Manchester&quot; on sky-blue billboards in a 2005 advertising campaign, yet appear to see no conflict between that and proposed ownership by the former Thai prime minister. One desire currently overrides everything: money. Having arrived with dreams in their hearts four years ago at a 48,000-seat stadium built by the local council, City have tumbled into gloom. Season-ticket sales have fallen 20%, borrowings stand at \u00a3103m and Stuart Pearce was sacked as manager after his side scored fewer home league goals last season than any top-flight club in history. Wardle and Makin, who loaned \u00a320m mostly to finance Kevin Keegan&apos;s spending before Pearce, want out. City announced at December&apos;s AGM that they were talking to investors, but stories of US businessmen never solidified into a bid. Ray Ranson, the former City full-back, has made a proposal backed by the private equity fund Sisu, which City refuse to entertain. The club seem to have fallen on Thaksin&apos;s bid because he is offering cash. Some fans are dazzled by the mooted millions, but not all. Ollie Goddard, of the Manchester City Supporters&apos; Trust, has spent days researching Thaksin and concludes: &quot;Many of the accusations against Thaksin clearly come from the military government seeking to justify their stated reasons for mounting the coup. But we are still concerned that our club could be damaged by association with him, particularly if criminal proceedings are mounted and he is imprisoned or subjected to huge financial penalties.&quot; From Dr Juree Vichit-Vadakan, secretary-general of the Thailand branch of Transparency International, came a plea: &quot;Yes, we have a military government, but Thaksin was ousted after widely reported allegations of corruption, nepotism and cronyism. British people should think harder whether they want somebody to buy a football club who is surrounded by moral uncertainty. Is money always the most important thing in life?&quot; The answer to that question is expected from Wardle, Makin and Manchester City within the next few days."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/24/1", "sentences": ["The size of the Alabama site has since been doubled and a new \u00a3100m plant in Singapore, which began production this month, has tripled capacity.", "Mr Ferguson said he expected Splenda sales growth to be largely offset by increased costs of production in Singapore and the expense of defending the patent against Chinese copycat manufacturers."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-24T22:53:14Z", "title": "Tate & Lyle pours millions into sweetener unloved by Americans", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Tate &amp; Lyle, which has spent hundreds of millions of pounds expanding production capacity for its Splenda sweetener, yesterday warned that the expected uplift in sales may be delayed and profits from the product will be hit by the cost of fighting patent infringements. The company, which this month began a claim against 18 Chinese import and distribution firms at the International Trade Commission, makes 20% of its profits from Splenda. Last night Tate &amp; Lyle shares closed down 40p at 605p, with 30m shares changing hands - three times the daily average. Detail yesterday on the difficulties facing Splenda came four months after the group first warned that take-up of the product, particularly by major US fizzy drinks groups, had not been as rapid as expected. Shares had fallen 16% following the January announcement. Splenda is locked in a bitter battle in the US with the sweetener aspartame, which until 1992 was sold under patent by NutraSweet. Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s product is gaining market share internationally - up from 26% to 28% for the year to March 31, at the expense of aspartame - but the group admits it is struggling to persuade some US fizzy drinks groups to switch. Manufacturers have told Tate &amp; Lyle that though Splenda may be a very convincing sugar substitute, many consumers have become &quot;acclimatised&quot; to the taste of aspartame. The chief executive, Iain Ferguson, insisted he would carry on ramping up production of Splenda ingredient Sucralose and expected to reach 70% of capacity by 2012. Until last autumn, the group had been unable to meet the demand for Splenda and was forced to ration supply because its single plant in Alabama did not have sufficient capacity. The size of the Alabama site has since been doubled and a new \u00a3100m plant in Singapore, which began production this month, has tripled capacity. Tate &amp; Lyle had been prompted to invest heavily in making the product after the Atkins and South Beach diet fads sent demand for low-calorie sweeteners soaring, particularly in the US. From 2003 to 2004 the number of product launches around the world containing Splenda leapt from 709 to 1,873 as food manufacturers scrambled to cash in on the craze. Mr Ferguson said demand had been so fierce some customers had been stockpiling the sweetener. With supply concerns now resolved, he said yesterday, these customers were running down their stockpiles, which was dampening sales. Mr Ferguson said he expected Splenda sales growth to be largely offset by increased costs of production in Singapore and the expense of defending the patent against Chinese copycat manufacturers. He told investors any profit growth at the division would be modest and come more in the second half of the year. Tate &amp; Lyle&apos;s chairman, Sir David Lees, insisted he remained committed to a plan to transform the focus of the business. &quot;The group has embarked on a strategy of building a stronger value-added business from a low-cost commodity base... Our strategy continues to be successful and, while the coming year will essentially be one of transition, it has provided the group with a stronger base from which to take advantage of growth opportunities.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/25/actionandadventure.sciencefictionandfantasy", "sentences": ["Things begin with a trip to Singapore to bring Chow Yun-Fat and his Chinese pirate crew on board - ostensibly to borrow his ship, but the real reason, I suspect, is to pick up a bargain lot of Oriental costumes for Keira Knightley."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-25T12:56:59Z", "title": "Steve Rose reviews Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End", "tags": ["Film", "Action and adventure", "Science fiction and fantasy", "Family", "Culture"], "article": "If ever there were a critic-proof movie, this is surely it. Its predecessor was the highest-earning release of last year, and it left everything to be settled in this final instalment. Even if it consisted of nothing but Johnny Depp picking his nose with a cutlass for two-and-a-half hours, everyone would still have to go and see it for themselves, wouldn&apos;t they? Our weapons are useless against it. Fortunately, it&apos;s more entertaining than watching Depp pick his nose, but this is one hulking, cumbersome beast of a movie. Freighted with box-office booty, impossibly high expectations and a cast of characters that&apos;s sprawling out of control like a many-tentacled sea monster, it&apos;s a very different picture from the first fleet-footed, light-hearted movie. In what&apos;s become standard practice for threequels, the masters of the Pirates franchise felt that the only way they could top the previous two movies was to give us more of everything: more colourful characters, more nautical mythology, even bigger special effects, all building up to a colossal, decisive &quot;everyone vs everyone else&quot; battle, just like The Lord of the Rings, the Matrix Reloaded, and particularly Return of the Jedi, which this movie apes as sure as part two did The Empire Strikes Back. As a result, a large portion of this film is spent pedantically aligning every character arc and plot detail so as to manoeuvre everyone into position for the big climax. At times you feel as if you&apos;re watching inanimate figurines and model ships being shunted around a big map with sticks. Nor is there much time for joking; everybody is too busy cutting deals in this movie. There are more pacts and agreements and changes of allegiance and negotiations over terms and conditions than most viewers will be able to keep track of. Not to mention a growing list of piratical gadgets and trinkets: the &quot;nine pieces of eight&quot;, the map that&apos;s like a jigsaw puzzle, Davy Jones&apos;s heart, the goddess Calypso, the compass, it goes on. For free and reckless rogues of the high seas, these pirates sure seem to love their bureaucracy. Who knew there was a highly organised council of pirate lords who meet in times of crisis at a secret headquarters? At one stage, the bickering factions even settle a dispute by pulling out a big, thick book of pirate rules. So much for &quot;Yo ho ho and a bottle or rum.&quot; These could be Lawyers of the Caribbean. Of course, movies like this aren&apos;t about the fiddly detail, they&apos;re about broad strokes, and on that level, Pirates still delivers better than most. The best way to enjoy it is to ignore all the fancy-dress board meetings, turn off your confused brain and simply give your eyes a treat. There&apos;s always something to marvel at. Things begin with a trip to Singapore to bring Chow Yun-Fat and his Chinese pirate crew on board - ostensibly to borrow his ship, but the real reason, I suspect, is to pick up a bargain lot of Oriental costumes for Keira Knightley. By now, Knightley has made the transition to fully fledged pirate status. She&apos;s armed to the teeth, and as handy with a cutlass as her perennially wet paramour, Orlando Bloom. This diversion is followed by a mission to sail off the edge of the world and rescue Depp&apos;s Jack Sparrow, and it&apos;s the most spectacular thing in the film. There are vast polar caverns and dark, starlit seas full of dead souls, while Depp is trapped in a bleached-out desert hell populated only by versions of himself and rocks that turn into crabs - something like Dante meets Being John Malkovich. Similarly, the big showdown takes place on two ships swirling around a vortex in the middle of the ocean, with storms raging and duels on the rigging and cannons booming - proper pirate stuff, in other words, even if there are times when you want to pause the action and say, &quot;Hang on. So he&apos;s fighting this guy to get that key, which opens this chest, so then he can get that thing, and help the other guy help his father, and, oh forget it.&quot; What, after all, is everyone actually fighting for? Just before the big battle, Knightley gives a stirring Braveheart-style pre-battle speech to rouse the troops in which she talks about &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;the pirate way&quot;, which the nasty British Empire is seeking to wipe out. There&apos;s a great deal of nostalgia for the pirate way and a great many people die for it, too. The very first scene is a mass hanging, and the body count continues to rise steadily throughout, but aside from nostalgia, there doesn&apos;t appear to be much purpose to the whole conflict. These aren&apos;t oppressed communities we&apos;re talking about, or a popular liberation front, or even Jedi leading a rebel alliance, they&apos;re pirates! They loot and pillage and generally flout the law, don&apos;t they? Think about it all too hard and the Pirates franchise starts to look like what it is: a brazen attempt to build a Star Wars-like mythology out of a theme-park ride. With such hollow intentions it should have sunk long ago, but buoyed by luck, comedy and state-of-the-art special effects, it has not only survived the journey intact, it&apos;s also washed down its decks, ready for a whole new cycle of movies to begin. Personally, I&apos;d be happy to weigh the anchor here."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/26/originalwriting.fiction", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-25T23:04:42Z", "title": "D\u00e9nouement", "tags": ["Books", "Original writing", "Fiction", "Culture", "David Mitchell"], "article": "Here is an aeroplane window. Here is a nocturnal airfield. Here is my dry tongue, and the after-taste of medicine. Here is a pillow, fallen on my lap. &quot;You were groaning in your sleep like I-Don&apos;t-Know-What!&quot; Jean is strapped in beside me. We must be departing, not arriving. &quot;Moaning, snoring, drooling ... I had half a mind to disavow all knowledge of you, and ask for a new seat.&quot; &quot;I was just ...&quot; My dream skates off. Jean was in it, blundering towards the lip of the quarry on the Malvern Hills. A blizzard had muffled my warning shouts. &quot;I was just resting my eyes.&quot; My wife says, &quot;Whatever.&quot; &quot;That expression does not suit a woman of your years.&quot; Jean does her hippopotamus snort. &quot;Counted the candles on your cake lately, Graham Nixon?&quot; If there is a need to evacuate the aircraft, a floor-mounted lighting system will guide you to the nearest exit. Please be aware that this may be behind you. Our exit is three rows in front. For every passenger, I notice, there must be three or four unoccupied seats. If there is a change in cabin pressure, an oxygen mask will automatically fall from the overhead lockers. An air hostess demonstrates &quot;in synch&quot; with the announcement. Her hair is honey-brown and she is ageless. As I give her safety demonstration the attention it deserves, my memory flips over a picture of Rebecca Piper. That girl was an accident waiting to happen, so Logic assures me, as it has done hundreds of times before. Fit the mask to your face, and pull on the tabs to release the flow of oxygen. Be sure to fit your own mask before assisting children or old people. Did I hear that correctly? &quot;&apos;Old people&apos;?&quot; &quot;Oh, don&apos;t start.&quot; &quot;This is not me &apos;starting&apos;, Jean! This is blatant ageism!&quot; &quot;Do I detect another Mr Disgusted letter coming on?&quot; &quot;Better Mr Disgusted than Mrs Lie-Down-And-Be-Trampled-On - and Yes, since you ask - some Managing Director somewhere is in for a very frank missive indeed.&quot; &quot;&apos;Managing Directors&apos; became &apos;Chief Executives&apos; in the early 90s.&quot; &quot;Aren&apos;t we just &apos;Ahead of the Curve&apos;?&quot; Jean picks up the in-flight magazine. I get my notebook from my jacket pocket to draft my letter. However, I soon run into difficulties. What airline are we flying? Where are we going? What airport is this? In fact, I have no recollections of today whatsoever, prior to waking up just now. I check my pockets for ticket stubs or boarding passes, but recover only a button off a blazer. Once outside the aircraft pull on the tabs to inflate the life-jacket. Use the attached tube to top up the air, as required. The jacket is fitted with a light and whistle for attracting attention. These &quot;memory blanks&quot; no longer cause me undue panic. If the salient facts don&apos;t catch up in their own time, enough of the &quot;old grey matter&quot; remains to glean the necessary clues. No, I shan&apos;t ask Jean. Doing so would worry her, and make a decrepit dodderer of me. In point of fact, I feel rather well - maybe not the pink of health, but well out of the sickly khaki. Our aeroplane begins its taxi to the runway. I replace my notebook before Jean notices my lack of progress, and extract the laminated Safety Information card from the seat pocket in front of me. This I now set about committing to memory. &quot;Abuse it or lose it&quot;, as Dr Chester White, who is Caribbean and black, is fond of saying, along with his deadpan jokes about sacrificial roosters. I shall send him a postcard when we get there. &quot;The exit chutes inflate automatically when the exits are opened,&quot; I inform Jean. &quot;Then they detach, to serve as life-rafts.&quot; &quot;That will be a hoot.&quot; I&apos;d better stay on board, to herd the Great British Public out, and ensure the women remove their pointed heels. As I used to say at school assembly on the morning of the fire drill, what stands between an emergency and a disaster is one man who keeps his head. Printed atop the safety card is my first clue to what we are doing here. Our airline company&apos;s name is &quot;Air D\u00e9nouement&quot;. Did any so-called &quot;focus-group&quot; ever dream up a sillier moniker? Now in the days of one-airline-one-country, you knew where you were. British Airways. Air Italia. Singapore Airlines. Nowadays this aviation lark is a &quot;free-for-all&quot;. Bingo Airlines. Scratch&apos;n&apos;Sniff Skybus. I-Can&apos;t-Believe-It&apos;s-Not Airways. Air Denou\u00e9ment, if you please! Could it be a French set-up, then, I wonder? Might we be flying to Paris, on a sort of &quot;second honeymoon&quot;? I probe Jean. &quot;I wonder if I should have brought a thicker coat ...&quot; &quot;Oh, you packed for four seasons. More than four. You packed for eight seasons.&quot; My wife turns her page. &quot;As per usual.&quot;   &quot;Look who it isn&apos;t!&quot; Jean is jerking her thumb at a rotund gentleman in the aisle seats next to us. &quot;Just look who it isn&apos;t!&quot; Sitting there is a very famous television comedian, and actor. We watched his programmes even when Ruth was little. He&apos;s not one of these &quot;groundbreaking&quot; transsexual merchants who swear and mock the handicapped. He&apos;s a family comedian. Oh, what is the man&apos;s name? His giant hands are busy shuffling a pack of cards, over and over. Is he a nervous flier? I hiss at my gawping wife, &quot;You&apos;re behaving like a &apos;fan&apos;.&quot; &quot;But I am! He won&apos;t mind one little autograph - he does Comic Relief every year. Get one for Ruth while you&apos;re at it.&quot; &quot;You molest him, if you must. But I shan&apos;t be defending your honour if he tells you where to get off.&quot; I miss whatever twaddle my wife spouts back, because my attention is hijacked by a bearded fundamentalist-looking-type sitting in the window seat directly across from us, beyond the famous comedian. Not only his holy beard and general hawkishness set the alarm bells ringing, but his lips too. They are moving in silent prayer. Now, &quot;racist&quot; was one thing I was never called, not even by that Ear-studded Hobbit from Ofsted who had clearly never done a day&apos;s &quot;coal-face&quot; teaching in his life. Black, yellow, red, Bangladeshi, Chinese or Martian, everyone got the same treatment in my school. My cane was as colour-blind as it was fair-minded. But ever since &quot;9/11&quot; - which ought to be &quot;11/9&quot; in point of fact - and that Open University for Jihadists better known as &quot;Iraq&quot; opened up, we all have a duty to be vigilant. The bearded fundamentalist has a shaven colleague, too, occupying the seat behind. He is reading a book. Normally that is a favourable sign, but this book has that blank plasticky cover universally favoured by publishers of the Word of God. We must be flying out of Birmingham, then. Makes sense. Birmingham is Worcestershire&apos;s closest airport, and well known for its racial diversity. &quot;Graham?&quot; Jean tugs my sleeve. &quot;Anyone home?&quot; &quot;Thinking about our trip, dear.&quot; Someone needs to watch that pair like a hawk.   Our aeroplane waits at the foot of the runway. The blue, red and green ground-lights remind me of some long-lost boyhood dominoes. Where do all these relics end up, I wonder? The engines change pitch from a lazy drone to a roar, the aeroplane rattles, and the captain releases the hand-brake. A modern terminal building zooms by in the distance. The airport name eludes me. Our aeroplane&apos;s nose lifts, our stern wheel thumps and Jean pats my hand. I pat hers back. Lyme Regis, I&apos;d thought, was to be our final holiday. Now look at us, flying off to foreign parts. If only I could remember which foreign parts. My memory is like a certain type of teenager. The more one interrogates it, the sulkier it becomes. Below us, a large city sinks and rotates. Here is a gas-works. Here is a sports stadium. Here is a strung-out knot of car headlights which could be Spaghetti Junction. In point of fact, however, the city evoked for me is Captain Nemo&apos;s underwater haven from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Mr Lincoln, my own headmaster, awarded me a splendid edition of Jules Verne&apos;s masterpiece, for being the Most Diligent Boy of 1952. &quot;Pinch your nose,&quot; advises Jean the &quot;Seasoned Traveller&quot;, &quot;then try to breathe out through it. It adjusts your ears to the air-pressure.&quot; She must have read it in one of her women&apos;s magazines, but it works. Jean crows, &quot;See?&quot; I award her the slightest nod. The famous comedian is making cards emerge from the pack, as if plucked by invisible fingertips. Maybe he started his career as a magician. The bearded fundamentalist has finished his prayers, but his jaw is clenching and unclenching. Next, I watch him do something that doesn&apos;t quite add up. He stands up, pulls down a respectable-looking bag from the overhead locker, rifles inside it for a few seconds, and then returns it, without removing a single item. Why would he do that? The shaven fundamentalist has swapped his Holy Book for his &quot;iPod&quot;. He might be listening to Coldplay or whoever is &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; this week. Equally, however, one of those &quot;Preachers of Hate&quot; could be injecting his brain with some toxic sermon. Suddenly the man looks at me, straight in the eye. As if he can hear my very thoughts.   The air hostess with the honey-brown bob approaches. Air hostesses are only flying waitresses, you know. That is what I told Rebecca Piper, thirty years ago, and not a day has passed when I did not ache to retract those words. An American would doubtless sue me for it, these days, for &quot;Defaming my Dream&quot;, or some such. In my defence, one was never sure how serious Rebecca Piper was about anything. True, an air hostess still had a &quot;halo of glamour&quot; in the 1970s, but Rebecca Piper possessed a command of irony that no teenager has any business possessing. The air hostess rests her arm on the back of Jean&apos;s chair. Her perfume leaves a ghostly trace. &quot;Hi,&quot; she says to the passengers behind us, and although this greeting normally riles me, it suits the air hostess to an absolute &quot;T&quot;. &quot;You pressed the attendant button?&quot; Unlike Jean, I resist the impulse to turn around. &quot;Well.&quot; The passenger is Welsh. &quot;This is my son, Tom.&quot; &quot;Hello, Tom.&quot; &quot;Er, hi.&quot; Tom sounds like a tenth or eleventh grader. &quot;Tom wants to join the RAF,&quot; the mother explains, &quot;after his &apos;A&apos;-levels. He&apos;s already had one interview, and it went very well, didn&apos;t it Tom? We&apos;ve established that he has 20-20 vision. And we were wondering, if it&apos;s not too much trouble ...&quot; &quot;You&apos;d like to have a look at the cockpit?&quot; &quot;That&apos;d be just ...&quot; replies the boy, &quot;yeah, ... so terrific.&quot; Children mumble and their sentences slouch so, nowadays. &quot;No promises, Tom, but I&apos;ll go and have a word with the captain.&quot; The mother and son thank her, and off she goes. I approve of Tom. An idiotic impulse seizes me, first to introduce myself to the mother as a retired headmaster, and then to tell Tom about my dad, who was an RAF pilot also named Tom, and also from Wales, and who saw active service in the war. Best not to, however, I decide. My father was shot down over Dresden before I was born, in point of fact. Meanwhile, the shaven fundamentalist has unplugged himself from his &quot;iPod&quot;. It occurs to me that he was listening in just now. If so, he&apos;ll know that security around the captain&apos;s cabin is less than rigid. Jean says, &quot;Just popping to the loo.&quot; I very much wish she wouldn&apos;t, but what would I say? The bearded fundamentalist watches Jean go, and murmurs into a Dictaphone. His expression is best described by the oxymoron &quot;deranged calmness&quot;. Not long ago, the Six o&apos;Clock News played the pre-recorded testament of a suicide bomber who wore that very expression. What distinguished him from any number of lads who see the world in dyed-black wrongness and bleached-white rightness was his appalling readiness for death. Where was that inner voice, who says Yes, but isn&apos;t there another side to this? or Hang on, why aren&apos;t my mentors urging their children to this glorious death? or If things had been a little different, might not I be you? That inner voice lay crushed under abject injustice; or else was slain in cold blood by intoxicated zealotry. Which is the more tragic, I cannot say. The famous comedian is playing patience on his tray-table. Not very successfully, judging from his constant reshufflings and stoical sighs. Without warning, the cabin lights dim. All is as dark as the womb.   In my golden pond of lamplight, I examine D\u00e9nouement Sky Magazine. It is a sales brochure of &quot;grooming products&quot;, executive cars, sunglasses, &quot;Rolexes&quot; and glossy guff. My surprise is extreme, then, to encounter first the portrait of Michel Eyquem de Montaigne; and second to see that the editors have reprinted one of his finest essays: That to Philosophize is to Learn How to Die. Forty years ago, as a philosophy undergraduate, I translated this very text from the sixteenth-century French. This must be some aerial equivalent of the commendable &quot;Poems on the Underground&quot; scheme. Here, I remember this passage: Caesar, to a jaded and broken-down soldier of his guard, who came to him in the street to ask his leave to be put to death, looking at his decrepit appearance, humorously replied, &quot;You think, then, that you are alive?&quot; Once upon a time, becoming a Montaigne scholar was my foremost ambition. Jean&apos;s father, however, swung my first appointment as schoolmaster, then Ruth was born, promotions followed, the grammar school went comprehensive, and one morning I awoke to find myself in charge of eighty teaching staff and nine hundred pupils. Here is the Cicero reference: Cicero says that philosophizing is nothing more than preparing for death. That is as much to say that study and contemplation in some sort withdraw our soul outside of us, and keep it occupied apart from the body, and this is a kind of resemblance to death; or perhaps, all the wisdom and reason in the world converge in one point, to teach us not to fear death. &quot;They make coffins bigger than that loo,&quot; says Jean, sitting down. &quot;Found anything good?&quot; &quot;Yes, in point of fact. An essay, by Montaigne!&quot; &quot;The actor chap in that Green Card film we watched with Ruth?&quot; Jean&apos;s little joke. Every 1st of January, I&apos;d tell her, I&apos;m going to start my Montaigne book this year. But school would kick off, some crisis or other would mug February, Easter sprung upon us, and before I knew it, the June exams would kick down the doors, and July marched off a new platoon of pupils, some to universities, some to fall through a &quot;gap year&quot;, some to the Services, some to Tesco, one or two to Kidderminster Prison. Then September marched in the new recruits. The pupils stayed eternally young, whilst I grew steadily old, and never once did I find room for Michel Eyquem de Montaigne on this annual Merry-go-Round. Can it really be true that the more people&apos;s lives you acquire influence over, the less influence you have over your own? Here comes my air hostess again. &quot;Sorry to keep you, Tom. A passenger in first class was feeling poorly. The captain wonders if you are free to join him?&quot; &quot;What about that, Tom!&quot; says the mother. &quot;Lush!&quot; says Tom. &quot;Lush!&quot; The three of them disappear through the curtain. &quot;&apos;Lush&apos;?&quot; I look at Jean. &quot;&apos;Verdant Vegetation&apos;?&quot; &quot;Once upon a time,&quot; Jean replies, &quot;you&apos;d mock me for saying &apos;brilliant&apos;.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s a fib.&quot; &quot;Oh no it is not, Graham Nixon! You&apos;d say, &apos;Oooh, such-and-such is very bright.&apos; What&apos;s more: for years you took the Mickey out of anyone, including Ruth, who used the word &apos;age-ism&apos;.&quot; Did I? Since my first stroke, I have a morbid fear that people use my &quot;memory blanks&quot; to run rings around me. But were Jean to stoop so low, I&apos;d be lost. &quot;That was before those words gained wider currency.&quot; &quot;Who&apos;s to say &apos;lush&apos; won&apos;t?&quot; The shaven fundamentalist stands up. He watches my air hostess, Tom and his mother walk towards the captain&apos;s cabin. Breaking into a trot, he follows them, on the parallel gangway, and my old headmaster&apos;s instinct tells me, loud and clear, It is about to begin. I unclip my seatbelt and push past Jean. &quot;What is it?&quot; asks Jean. &quot;Are you sick?&quot; Sick is exactly what I feel. &quot;I&apos;ll be right back.&quot;   The shaven fundamentalist has been in the lavatory for a full quarter of an hour. I maintain my vigil from a vacant seat, having spun Jean a tale about Dr White &quot;prepping&quot; me about exercise and deep-vein thrombosis. My new medication is affecting my perception, very slightly, because the passengers appear to be growing sparser. Like my memory lapses, I do not fret over medicinal side-effects. They are the price to pay for freedom from debilitating pains; and, at this juncture, I have a mission to perform. The minutes pass, and pass, and pass. What&apos;s he up to in there? My relief that the cockpit wasn&apos;t stormed once again turns to anxiety. The lavatory door opens at last, but as the fundamentalist steps out, his bearded co-religionist steps up. The two make eye contact, and the words Cheers Mate and Hope I didn&apos;t keep you are exchanged, in Black Country accents. That may sound innocuous, but what code-words do not? The lavatory door is locked once again. It&apos;s well known how Terrorist A can leave a tube of Chemical X in an agreed-upon location, so that Terrorist B can mix it with Chemical Y. The resultant Chemical Z blows a hole in the fuselage at 20,000 feet. Once again, I try to recall the security arrangements back at the airport, but in vain. Waking up on this aeroplane with a pillow falling away is the first memory of the entire day. Telling Jean is out of the question. She&apos;ll suggest I call Inspector Morse on the &quot;Bat-phone&quot;. No, I must devise my own strategy. Whenever I caned a child, I sought to have the miscreant understand both the consequences of his misdemeanour and, if possible, its origins. Often, I was wasting my time, but now and then a light would switch on. The question here is this: How do you enlighten two men who are ready to blow up an aeroplane? No, I&apos;m wrong. Here is the question: How can we even communicate? We share the same physical space, but what of moral space? Peace is ensured by people co-habiting moral space, and war comes when walls and fences spring up across it. Within these fortified enclaves, meanings mutate. &quot;Wanton Murder&quot; in one means &quot;Martyrdom&quot; in the other. &quot;Kidnapping&quot; comes out as &quot;Rendition&quot; or &quot;Fund-raising&quot; or &quot;Act of War&quot;. I talk of &quot;Enlightenment&quot;: they see &quot;Squalor of the Spirit&quot;. The labour of reunifying two moral spaces is Herculean, no, Protean. Meanings must be reconciled even before people. The lavatory door opens. I &quot;play possum&quot; as the bearded fundamentalist passes. Once the coast is clear, I enter the tiny cubicle and lock the door. Here is a rubbish bin. It contains one disposable toothbrush and a few paper towels. Here is a little cupboard. This contains three rolls of inferior lavatory paper. Here is a tissue box, containing tissues. The cubicle is a single moulded unit, with no spaces above the ceiling or behind the mirror. I can only conclude the bomb was not planted in the lavatory. The Graham Nixon in the mirror looks anxious, but otherwise well. That crazing of red veins in my eyes is cleared up, my beard is trimmed, though another effect of Dr White&apos;s medicine is to retard stubble-growth - I should need a shave at this time of day. Even my waterworks, when I use the lavatory, perform better than in many a moon. I wash my hands and straighten my tie. Then, when I try to leave, I discover that the door-bolt won&apos;t slide into the OPEN position. Too late, I understand: the terrorists knew I was on to them, so they lured me in here. Here is abject panic.   &quot;Here we go,&quot; the famous comedian apologises, a moment later. &quot;What joker designed these doors, do you suppose, eh?&quot; &quot;Atrocious,&quot; I gasp. &quot;You could&apos;ve been pulling on your side, and I could&apos;ve been pulling my side, like a right pair of flamin&apos; twerps, until Kingdom Come.&quot; I squeeze past, my pulse detonating my ear-drums. The incident is absurd, but so is sitting on well-grounded fears about terrorism for a second longer. Every hijacking in history must be preceded by an observant spectator smelling a rat, but who says nothing for fear of making an exhibition of himself. Here is my air hostess in the first-class cabin, kneeling with a male colleague by a woman passenger who looks somewhat &quot;green around the gills&quot;. &quot;Young lady,&quot; I address my air hostess, &quot;might I have a discreet word?&quot; &quot;Sir, would you give me just one moment?&quot; One whiff of hysteria from an elderly person, and his credibility is shredded. &quot;Very well, but it is rather important.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ll be with you as soon as possible, Sir.&quot; The male steward makes an announcement on the &quot;intercom&quot;. &quot;Ladies and gentleman, a passenger is feeling a little unwell. If we have a medical doctor on board, please identify yourself to the attendant.&quot; My air hostess walks down the aeroplane. The steward takes a glass of water to the poorly passenger, who would feel years younger simply by laying off the chocolate \u00e9clairs. I take a window seat and try to distract myself from thoughts of explosive devices. Far beneath us, moonlit clouds resemble a limitless ice-sheet. Here and there are holes, and through these dots of light are visible, very faint, as if observed through the lens of an inadequate telescope. Rebecca Piper&apos;s favoured misdemeanour was to purloin costly, useless items: metalwork tools, sporting equipment, and such like. Her charming mother, an opera singer living off divorce settlements, sat in my office agreeing with my every last word, but impressed upon her daughter not a single one, including my final warning. Things came to a head one afternoon just before Christmas, always a hazardous time in the school calendar. Rebecca Piper used a coat-hanger to break into my car. She removed a spare coat and hat, my briefcase and umbrella, and paraded around the corridors pretending to be Mr Nixon. The hysterical laughter accompanying her grand tour brought the lunch-time monitors running, and Rebecca Piper was confined to the Stationary Room while I devised her punishment. Eileen Lippetts, my head of English for many years, and Rebecca Piper&apos;s form tutor, warned me, Kid gloves, Graham. Nothing you can do to that kid could top what&apos;s already been done to her. I knew better, of course, and decided that public humiliation was a fitting sentence for an exhibitionist. At school assembly the following morning, I made Rebecca Piper stand up, in front of all nine hundred pupils, and recounted the previous day&apos;s events in my deadliest voice. I demanded to know if anyone felt like laughing now. The silence was gratifying. I asked Rebecca Piper, Do you want me to expel you? She replied, You can&apos;t do that! Sensing her imminent tears and my imminent victory, I assured her that Oh, Yes, I most certainly could. She replied, But how can you, Graham Nixon, when I already expelled myself. Rebecca Piper walked out into the dark Midlands winter. She had duped me. This was the exit she&apos;d dreamed of. &quot;Now, Sir.&quot; My air hostess is back. &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; &quot;Ah.&quot; I must choose my words for maximum effect. &quot;There are these two passengers.&quot; I take the precaution of checking that nobody can overhear us, and here, to my surprise, is the bearded fundamentalist. He kneels in the gangway, next to the poorly passenger. He presses a stethoscope to her chest. &quot;Sir? You said it was important?&quot; The doctor makes a joke. His patient looks better already. &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;Might I have a pair of ear-phones, please?&quot;   &quot;You&apos;re being very quiet,&quot; remarks Jean. &quot;Back in our old school office, are we? Graham Nixon versus the Woes of the World?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m just enjoying the food. It&apos;s not half bad.&quot; &quot;Positively &apos;Lush&apos;, I should say.&quot; &quot;This sticky toffee pudding is as good as yours.&quot; &quot;Steady on, Graham Nixon. It&apos;s good to see you eating like a hog again; not just snoring like one.&quot; &quot;Yours hardly touched the sides, I notice.&quot; My air hostess refills the famous comedian&apos;s glass, and is rewarded by a saucy wink. I am too embarrassed even to look at her. Jean whispers, &quot;That&apos;s his third.&quot; &quot;Three glasses of wine isn&apos;t so much.&quot; &quot;His third bottle, Graham. Comedians have a name for excess, mind. Remember what that taxi driver in Lyme Regis told us about the orgies in Benny Hill&apos;s mansion?&quot; &quot;That was just local colour, to increase his tip. Where have the young lad and his mother got to, do you think?&quot; &quot;Bumped up to first class, possibly. During your long-distance hike, an attendant came around, inviting other passengers to go and meet the captain. Quite a few have already taken up the offer.&quot; &quot;That must violate every protocol in the book.&quot; &quot;You know, I rather fancy a peek, myself. Will you be all right?&quot; &quot;Yes: if you promise not to think about sitting in the driver&apos;s seat.&quot; Jean smirks like a teenager and goes. To justify asking for the ear-phones, I plug myself into &quot;In-Flight Radio&quot;, fearing an attack of Ooh-yeah-Baby music, or Thumpy-thumpy-thumpy music. But first up is the magnificent &quot;Love on the Rocks&quot; by Neil Diamond. Nobody can put over a tune like Diamond, except John Denver, who follows next! Dr White&apos;s new drugs over-stimulate the tear glands, I find. Around the line, Dark and dusky, painted on the sky, I have to dab my eyes on my napkin. That Ralph McTell follows on with &quot;Streets of London&quot; is a coincidence nearly as striking as the Montaigne essay. For Jean and I, this is what women call &quot;Our Song&quot;. Might we have chosen these songs, off a menu of some sort, before boarding? My eyes grow heavy, all of a sudden, and close themselves.   And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. Here is a pillow, fallen on my lap. Here is a blue line to divide Earth from Heaven. Here, it opens up. Here are frosted purples, waxy ambers and rearing cloud-heads. Here is an ache in my ribs, to capture this sunrise, and remember it, always. No, to be it. &quot;It&apos;s a matter of ... waiting for the right flamin&apos; combination ... then the floodgates open.&quot; The famous comedian is addressing me, as he places his cards. There is nobody else: even the passengers I mistook for fundamentalists are gone. &quot;But, unless I&apos;m very much mistaken, it&apos;s all ... about to ... come ... clear ...&quot; He smiles that famous smile and he nods at the seat next to him. &quot;Clap your pork-pies on this. This doesn&apos;t happen very often ...&quot; It feels natural to accept his offer. &quot;Sitting comfortably? A-One!&quot; As the famous comedian turns over the Jack of Clubs, his name comes back to me. Ronnie Barker! The one and only Ronnie Barker! He gives me his Wasn&apos;t-Born-Yesterday face, and I can almost hear an audience laugh, with me amongst them. &quot;A-Two!&quot; Ronnie Barker turns over the Queen of Clubs, and my memory reveals the living room in our house in Great Malvern. I am in my ratty armchair by the unlit hearth. The young policeman perches on the sofa, much jumpier than I. Jean was his first sudden death. It will be some hours yet before the fact that I am now a widower begins its awful transformation. In point of fact, the television is still on: Jean had Richard and Judy on when she went upstairs. Just popping to the loo. My last word to her was a grunt. Here is the television news. Comedian Ronnie Barker, star of Porridge and Open All Hours, and co-star of The Two Ronnies, died in hospital earlier today. The young policeman says, Oh no. I tell him how Jean, Ruth and I never missed an episode of The Two Ronnies. &quot;And,&quot; Ronnie Barker turns over the King of Clubs, &quot;a-Three!&quot; &quot;Jean was here!&quot; I grip something. &quot;She was here! On this aeroplane! She was just here!&quot; Ronnie Barker does a Don&apos;t-Get-Your-Knickers-In-A-Twist face, and prises my fingers from his forearm. &quot;Nobody&apos;s saying she wasn&apos;t, are they?&quot; We look at each other, and I understand. This has happened before. The ache of disappointment grows into pain. &quot;I&apos;m dreaming. I dreamed her, and I&apos;m dreaming you.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ll try not to be offended.&quot; Ronnie Barker sniffs. &quot;Pinch yourself.&quot; &quot;Why should I? I&apos;d only be dreaming of pinching myself.&quot; &quot;Oh, Graham!&quot; That the Ronnie Barker knows my name is my dream&apos;s bizarrest touch so far, save its filmic lucidity. So bizarre, in point of fact, that a more ominous possibility has to be considered. &quot;Mr Barker -&quot; &quot;&apos;Ronnie&apos;. Only the taxman calls me &apos;Mr Barker&apos;.&quot; &quot;Ronnie ... this is a strange thing to ask, but if you know the truth ... I&apos;d rather hear it. Am I ... am I delusional?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t see any men in white coats. Does it feel like you&apos;re paddocked off on Fraggle Rock, eh?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know what ... &apos;Fraggle Rock&apos; feels like.&quot; &quot;What&apos;s that? And you a flamin&apos; headmaster for twenty years!&quot; Ronnie Barker gathers his cards. &quot;Well, time to inspect the delusional cockpit. I&apos;ll tell your dreamt-up wife you&apos;ll be along by-and-by, but I&apos;d hurry up, if I were you. Jean&apos;s a lovely lady, and pilots in uniform are very smooth talkers, and imaginary ones? Worst of all.&quot;   That I must follow where Ronnie Barker went, I know, but first I wish to finish Montaigne&apos;s essay. Towards its end, Montaigne imagines the voice of Nature. It is a matronly voice, one that brooks no ifs and buts, like a capable Domestic Science teacher I once hired, but compassionate, too. Chiron refused immortality, being informed of the conditions thereof by the god of time and duration himself, his father Saturn. Imagine, indeed, how much more grievous and insupportable everlasting life would be to man than the life I have given him. If you had not death you would eternally curse me for having deprived you of it. I have knowingly mingled a little bitterness with it, to prevent you, seeing the advantage of it, from embracing it too eagerly and too unwisely. To keep you in that middle state, which I require of you, where you neither fly life nor again fly death, I have tempered both one and the other between sweetness and bitterness. Well, Montaigne&apos;s truth is not absolute. Rebecca Piper flew life, aged sixteen, and most of us spend our life flying death, as best we can. What else are seatbelts and prunes and the NHS for? Yet, Montaigne still consoles me like no other. No truth is absolute, except maybe platitudes, and that is the problem with platitudes. Here is sublimity, where the oxygen grows thin. Here is the new day, uncrumpling itself into brilliance.   In the tiny galley at the front of the first-class cabin, my air hostess is immersed in her Joanna Trollope novel. &quot;Fillet of smoked mackerel with fluffy scrambled eggs, Sir? Or I can do you ... let&apos;s see ... honeydew melon, a saucer of blueberries, or even a flute of champagne?&quot; &quot;It&apos;s not just ... an uncanny resemblance, is it?&quot; &quot;No, Sir,&quot; answers Rebecca Piper. &quot;That boy, Tom. He was Dad, wasn&apos;t he?&quot; She gestures at the captain&apos;s door. &quot;Everyone&apos;s here.&quot; &quot;You must excuse me ... it&apos;s all ...&quot; &quot;Mighty disorientating?&quot; &quot;Mightily disorientating, yes.&quot; Rebecca Piper&apos;s navy Air D\u00e9nouement uniform is spotless, even after her night-shift. &quot;You look good. I mean, you look well. I mean - you were the worst error of my professional life.&quot; &quot;I was an obstreperous, self-obsessed, neurotic horror, Sir.&quot; &quot;Eileen Lippetts telephoned me that morning - you remember her?&quot; &quot;Kindnesses are the last thing we forget, Mr Nixon.&quot; &quot;Eileen said you&apos;d swallowed the entire medicine cabinet.&quot; &quot;Even the cod liver oil pellets, and my back&apos;s never twinged since.&quot; &quot;Eileen said your mother&apos;s housekeeper found you, when she came to get you ready for school. The house was icy. You never woke up.&quot; &quot;The poor woman had the shock of her life.&quot; &quot;If only I&apos;d listened to what you were telling me.&quot; &quot;Teenagers don&apos;t &apos;tell&apos;, Sir. They bellow, conceal, twist. Steal.&quot; &quot;You were,&quot; my voice fails me, &quot; ... my job.&quot; &quot;Can you forgive the violence I inflicted on you?&quot; &quot;Forgive?&quot; I think I mishear. &quot;There&apos;s nothing for me to forgive.&quot; &quot;Sir, do you forgive me?&quot; &quot;But -&quot; I look for another answer, but there isn&apos;t one. &quot;Yes.&quot; A day and a night pass, perhaps. &quot;Then I dissolve your right to carry on accusing yourself.&quot; A day and a night pass, perhaps. &quot;Sir?&quot; One of Rebecca Piper&apos;s hands touches my stringy old wrist. &quot;Are you ready to meet the captain now, Sir?&quot; \u00b7 David Mitchell will be appearing at the Hay festival today. www.hayfestival.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers1", "sentences": ["Each year, 14 trainees will spend up to six months working in its offices in Hong Kong, Moscow, Singapore or Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-26T15:41:51Z", "title": "News", "tags": ["Graduate careers", "Work & careers"], "article": "Law life - long hours, big bucks ...

Artistic ventures get off to a Flying Start Aspiring entrepreneurs with a flair for the arts are being offered advice on how to bring their artistic and social business ideas to life. The Flying Start Programme for Arts and Social Enterprise, launched by the National Council for Graduate Entrepreneurship, Arts Council England and Northern Edge (a consortium of 16 universities in the north of England) will help graduates define their business plans and learn how to set up an arts-based social enterprise that could include anything from working with children to celebrating diversity. Participants will have to attend a three-day course in September and will then receive expert advice over the next year. The programme is free - you just need to be committed to launching an artistic venture within a year. See www.flyingstart-ncge.com/arts for details. Leicester launches cancer treatment MSc The University of Leicester this week added a pioneering new Master&apos;s degree to its collection. The MSc in cancer chemistry, which starts in September and is believed to be the first of its kind in England, will offer students the chance to study new approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment, and involve drug design. Students should graduate equipped to work in academia or in the pharmaceutical industry. The charity Cancer Research UK is offering three student bursaries to help with funding. Oh! What a lovely speed camera When it comes to speed cameras, it&apos;s all about the packaging, believes Steve Harris, who, as part of a graduate scheme run by the University of the West of England, has helped one company design a new camera that emphasises road safety, rather than road fines. Harris, who studied creative product design, spent time working with Crown UK - which manufactures speed camera &quot;housings&quot; - under UWE&apos;s Graduate Consultancy Scheme, which finds recent graduates placements in appropriate industries. Harris looked at how cameras could be made more attractive to the public by incorporating illuminated speed signs. Through his work, Crown now has a new design being tested by the Home Office.

There&apos;s no synopsis of what has gone before to introduce us to pirate chief Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), colonial governor&apos;s daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and former blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are, or to explain how charismatic buccaneer Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) came to be in some sort of submarine purgatory. Even those who know the answer to these questions will be baffled by a plot that begins in Singapore and involves a battle between the corrupt head of the East India Company (Tom Hollander) and the federation of world pirates, and takes place on three ships: Black Pearl (its captaincy contested between Barbossa, Turner and Sparrow), a ghost ship, the Flying Dutchman, commanded by the half-man, half-octopus Captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and the Endeavour, a merchantman belonging to the East India Company. This is a film without elegance, grace, finesse or a real sense of fun, the qualities Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster brought to pirate swashbucklers. It suggests a heap of pearls - some genuine, some cultured, some distinctly fake - in search of a narrative string to make sense of them. It&apos;s as if there&apos;s been a mutiny on Walt Disney&apos;s bounty (the estimated budget is $200m) by the special-effects people, who&apos;ve taken over the ship and are sailing the Pacific without a compass. Indeed at one point someone asks of Captain Sparrow&apos;s aberrant conduct: &apos;Do you think he planned it all out or does he make it up as he goes along?&apos; For all the hectic battles, ships dropping off the edge of the world, the descent of galleons into a maelstrom, and Hans Zimmer&apos;s clamorous music, the principal sense is of a film floating rudderless in the doldrums. There are moments to make you gasp, much laboured humour, and unsuccessful attempts at sentiment (the most serious one coming at the end of the interminable final credits when the cinema was deserted except for devotees of credits and attendants picking up popcorn boxes). The highlight for many will probably be a guest appearance by Keith Richards as pirate king Captain Teague, an inevitable event after Depp announced on the DVD of the first film that Richards was his model for Sparrow. Parents should be warned that the film begins with a mass hanging, a succession of people going to the gallows seven at a time, among them a little boy who has to be put on a barrel so the noose can be fitted around his neck. Before the dead bodies are trundled away, their shoes are piled up in a manner that inevitably evokes memories of newsreels from Auschwitz. Is this what passes for black humour these days? Heaven, hell and halfway houses on the way to them have been a dramatic staple since medieval mystery and morality plays. There were a good many such films in the 1940s, and a spate of them in the early Nineties. The deadpan Norwegian comedy The Bothersome Man sees a 45-year-old suicide greeted in heaven. He arrives by bus at a garage on a dusty Icelandic plain and is then whisked to a clean, well-lit city where there are no children, the booze doesn&apos;t make you drunk, the food is tasteless, the sex is without love or lust, the jobs are meaningless, the only conversation is about interior decorating. He&apos;s soon bored, frustrated and attempting to get out. It&apos;s a brief, elegant, oddly convincing film. Set mostly in London, Cheeni Kum (Without Sugar) is a sentimental comedy starring Bollywood&apos;s top star, handsome 64-year-old Amitabh Bachchan, as a 64-year-old chef running London&apos;s best Indian restaurant. After falling in love with a 34-year-old beauty, he&apos;s egged on by his mother (the doughty 95-year-old Zohra Sehgal playing a woman of 85) to visit Delhi and confront the girl&apos;s father, six years his junior. The other woman in his life is a nine-year-old Indian girl dying of leukaemia. The chef gets to buy condoms (the Sikh owner of a London pharmacy shouts out to his assistant, &apos;Get the old man some Durex&apos;), but he doesn&apos;t get to use them. Produced by Gus Van Sant and directed by Cam Archer, Wild Tigers I Have Known is a wispy, zero-budget rite-of-passage tale about a 13-year-old Californian lad, lonely, bullied and trying to come to terms with his sexuality. He&apos;s probably gay, but his chief experience of sex is incessant masturbation. Impressionistic and uninteresting."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/27/film.india", "sentences": ["Since its launch in London in 2000, the IIFA&apos;s have been held in Sun City and Johannesburg in South Africa, and in Malaysia, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-27T13:10:31Z", "title": "Bollywood glitter adds glamour to Yorkshire grit", "tags": ["UK news", "Film", "India", "Bollywood", "World news", "Travel", "World cinema", "Culture"], "article": "Imagine crowds of beautiful women, draped in gold jewellery and red fabrics, dancing in sequence across the Pennines. Or a former Miss World falling theatrically into the arms of a muscled and almost impossibly good-looking actor on the windy beaches of the North Sea. Such scenes are a long way from the usual entertainment associated with Yorkshire, which is still, for many, more Last of the Summer Wine than big-budget movie paradise. But India&apos;s top film-makers will be enjoying just such full-on glamour next week when the eyes of Bollywood turn to the county for the biggest event in the industry&apos;s calendar. New York, Sydney and Barcelona were all in line to host the 2007 International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards, otherwise known as the Bollywood Oscars, but organisers opted for Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull and York. Yorkshire officials hope that, by showcasing the beauty of Britain&apos;s white-rose county through four days of glitter, parties and even the odd celebrity cricket match, Indian producers will be lured towards choosing it as a future setting for films, complete with flamboyant dancing and singing through the streets (cobbled), along the beaches (windy, possibly chilly) and across the hills (steep, maybe wet). &apos;This was always an opportunity to showcase Yorkshire,&apos; said Sabbas Joseph, director of the IIFAs, who chose the county after receiving a personal request from Tony Blair. &apos;The feedback from the industry has been phenomenal.&apos; It is not just actors and film-makers. Five hundred million viewers across the world are expected to watch Bollywood&apos;s elite arrive next week. Stars who across south Asia are more famous than Brad Pitt and more loved than Nicole Kidman will be soon be wandering through the streets of Sheffield and Bradford. Among them will be Amitabh Bachchan, the godfather of Bollywood, who has appeared in more than 130 films and won nearly 20 top awards. Other names, barely known here but renowned across the subcontinent and among India&apos;s vast diaspora, include Akshay Kumar, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta. With them will be Shilpa Shetty, made famous here by Big Brother, and British stars Sienna Miller and Colin Firth. The Bollywood stars will bring their own entourage and host colourful shows with dancing and singing. Of course, it would not be Bollywood without another great Indian love. After hosting a test match between England and the West Indies, Headingley will be prepared for a celebrity spectacular. A cricket match will be umpired by Dickie Bird, introduced by Zinta and include a team packed with famous Indian actors. Shetty will be there to carry out the toss. For Bollywood fans it will be like watching George Clooney come in to bat against Antonio Banderas, with Cameron Diaz commentating. The match will take place on the second day of the event, which will also include a forum bringing together Indian business people worth a total of \u00a360bn, a polo match, film premiere and the highlight - an awards ceremony attended by most of Bollywood&apos;s top talent. Thousands of fans will flock to Sheffield&apos;s Hallam FM arena a week on Saturday to try to catch a glimpse of their heart-throbs. Most will be hoping to see India&apos;s hottest couple - Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. Rai is a former Miss World, he is the son of a Bollywood legend. The fact that they met and fell in love on a Indian set was almost as cliched as the perfect Bollywood script. When they married last month it was one of India&apos;s most anticipated events. Fans climbed trees to try to get a peek, but with security as tight as it was for the Beckhams&apos; wedding there was little chance of seeing anything. Even in Britain, Rai is now renowned following leading roles in films such as Bride and Prejudice and Provoked. Next week she and Bachchan are sure to be followed by a team of security guards. Why is such a spectacle coming to Yorkshire? According to Joseph, it is because it is the biggest county in Britain, has never had a significant Indian investment and is home to many British Asians who make up some of Bollywood&apos;s most hardcore fans. &apos;Cineworld, Odeon and Vue all show Indian films as part of their repertoire now,&apos; said Joseph. &apos;Sixteen per cent of releases in the UK are Indian films and last year nine made it into the top 10.&apos; He pointed out that Bollywood now contributes \u00a3200m to the UK economy every year through producers filming, distributing and exhibiting in the country. The amount is rising by 25 per cent annually. These four days will boost the Yorkshire economy by \u00a310m and the event is likely to make top Indian film-makers much more interested in the county as a movie location. Joseph would not be drawn into why New York, Sydney and Barcelona were turned down and said that they were each still in line for future bids. Since its launch in London in 2000, the IIFA&apos;s have been held in Sun City and Johannesburg in South Africa, and in Malaysia, Singapore, Amsterdam and Dubai. This time, celebrity magazines across Asia and television chat-shows will be filled with tales of the journey of India&apos;s rich and famous to Yorkshire. As in Hollywood, they will be full of gossip, ranging from bitching and backstabbing to romance and who is likely to win what. &apos;This is one of the most prestigious awards ceremonies and it can really boost an actor&apos;s career,&apos; said Akshay Kumar, one of the stars who will take to the stage in Leeds next week. He said Bollywood hits were being increasingly filmed in Britain, and Yorkshire could yet make the perfect location. Last year Kumar shot two films here: &apos;Everything is available in the UK and there is so much support.&apos; The growth in international demand for Bollywood has also led film makers to seek out new, non-Asian audiences outside India. Rang de Basanti, a film about corruption starring the British actress Alice Patten, daughter of Chris, the ex-Tory politician, is about to be relaunched by production company UTV, to attract British viewers. The film has just been re-edited to reduce the amount of Hindi and has been cut (Bollywood movies are often three hours long) to bring it closer to the usual Hollywood-blockbuster length. It will be renamed The Colour of Sacrifice The IIFAs will see the first major Bollywood premiere ever to be held in Yorkshire. The film is The Train, about a married man who falls for another woman. But a preview on a Bollywood website, glamsham.com promises &apos;something even more shocking that probably has never been seen before in a Hindi movie&apos;. It will follow another controversial film, Provoked, which tells the tale of a battered British Asian housewife who eventually kills her violent husband. The film tells the true story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, from Slough, whose case set a precedent regarding the law&apos;s definition of &apos;provocation&apos;. Observers say it won&apos;t be long before Bollywood box-office takings start to rival those of Hollywood. Each year 3.1 billion cinema tickets for Bollywood films are sold in India compared with 2.9 billion for Hollywood hits in the US. At the moment that does not translate into the same amount of money because the vast majority of cinemas in India are single-screen and tickets cost on average 25p rather than $10. But there has been a massive growth in the number of multiplexes across India where tickets are closer to \u00a32.50. &apos;The Indian entertainment sector was worth $4.5bn last year and is already $10bn this year,&apos; said Jyoti Deshpande, chief operating officer and commercial director of Eros International, one of the world&apos;s leading international distributors of Bollywood films. &apos;Films used to be distributed through small cinemas and DVD shops. Now it is Odeons, Cineworlds and Vues, while the DVDs are available in Virgin and Asda. Films are now showcased at festivals like Cannes and reviewed in the mainstream press.&apos; Bollywood, Deshpande added, was like Hollywood in the Thirties but was now growing at a phenomenal rate. It may not be long until names such as Abhishek Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta are household names in the UK. They certainly soon will be in Yorkshire. Tinseltown, Asian-style In the late 19th century, Indian photographer, Harishchandra Sakharam Bhatvadekar bought a camera for 21 guineas in London. He took it back to India, shot several short films, and, in 1899, the Indian film industry was born. While films were shot in a number of different languages, those in Hindi quickly became the most prominent. In the early Seventies, a gossip magazine in Mumbai coined the word Bollywood, referring to the city&apos;s Hindi language film industry. It is often wrongly used to refer to the whole of India&apos;s film industry. Purists - among them some of the country&apos;s leading actors - deplore the term. They say it makes the industry look like Hollywood&apos;s poor cousin. Much to their annoyance, Bollywood has now become a permanent fixture, even holding a place in the Oxford English Dictionary. Plots are often melodramatic, with star-crossed lovers, angry families, love triangles, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains and tales of rags to riches. Few films are made without theatrical song and dance scenes. \u00b7 Tickets for the IIFA Foundation Charity Celebrity Cricket Match are priced \u00a322 (adult) and \u00a312 (child), and are available by calling 0871 222 0994, or online at yorkshireccc.com."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/may/29/puttingbollywoodonthebriti", "sentences": ["The awards, which take place in Sheffield next week, are hugely popular and extraordinarily lucrative, having visited a Midas-touch effect on many of their previous hosts (Singapore, Amsterdam, Johannesburg)."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-29T16:00:00Z", "title": "Putting Bollywood on the British map", "tags": ["Film"], "article": "A detail from the Visit Britain map A new Bollywood map detailing Indian cinema&apos;s most popular British locations, is being issued by the Visit Britain tourist authority ahead of the International Indian Film Academy Awards. The awards, which take place in Sheffield next week, are hugely popular and extraordinarily lucrative, having visited a Midas-touch effect on many of their previous hosts (Singapore, Amsterdam, Johannesburg).  But the map, which covers around thirty UK spots, from Tower Bridge to a Surrey football ground, may be protesting a little too much. It&apos;s one thing to try and grab a bit of the Bollywood buzz, but quite another to claim that the map will really be used by Indian visitors to the UK. Putting aside the fact that Indian tourists might not be thrilled at the prospect of making a cinephile pilgrimage to a Slough shopping centre, or pointing open-mouthed at the bit of greenery in front of an Oxfordshire village&apos;s All Bar One, the map overestimates its place in the scheme of Indian cinema. Foreign locations have always been as much a part of the Bollywood formula as music and dance - and usually they go hand in hand. Sometimes only the songs are filmed abroad. But the fantasy of exotic places goes right back at least to the sixties, the golden era of Indian cinema. Raj Kapoor&apos;s Sangam (1964) set many scenes in Switzerland; the self-evident locations of the films An Evening in Paris (1967) and Love in Tokyo (1966), and even the tiny mountain village of Sikkim, then not part of India, thrilled audiences of the 1967 hit Jewel Thief. The Great Gambler (1979) shot in Cairo, Lisbon, Venice and Rome, signalled an even broader scope which has continued to this day, notably aided by the Indian government&apos;s liberalisation of foreign currency exchange. Of the hundreds of global locations that have brought glamour and sheen to India&apos;s big screen, only those in the UK require indicating with a big pointy stick. And in one respect, it could be seen as good news: Visit Britain has at least learnt how to make a song and dance out of something. However, for those who prefer to greet the awards with real cultural preparation rather than a gimmicky and underwhelming location map, the following films are landmarks, each well worth every last minute of the three hour shifts involved: Guru Dutt&apos;s Pyaasa; the better known and multi award-winning Mother India; Pakeezah; and Guide. Not forgetting the fine piece of cinema that is the remarkable and innovative Sholay, a spaghetti western exploring the limits of lawlessness with a Peckinpah-like feel for violence."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/may/31/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection1", "sentences": ["Singapore has it, France is trialling 100Mbps in Paris (four times as fast as what BT plans for the distant future) before rolling it out elsewhere."], "publicationDate": "2007-05-30T23:05:29Z", "title": "Victor Keegan: Fibre, not copper, is the future of the web", "tags": ["Technology"], "article": "If Nobel prizes were handed out to things as well as people, one would surely have to go to the humble copper wire. Its versatility has proved astonishing. A quarter of a century ago pundits were writing its obituary because of the imminent arrival of optic fibres, which would leave it dead on the pavement. The reasoning was obvious: fibre was so powerful that a single thread could carry all US telephone calls on Mothers&apos; Day simultaneously. As the price came down it was bound to oust copper. Visionaries were urging Europe to build a fibre network to kick-start an economic revival. Yet 25 years later it still hasn&apos;t happened. Other things have come from nowhere, such as mobile phones, but fibre has still not reached the home in Britain, apart from special cases. Such complacency could prove fatal for the long-term success of the UK economy because other nations are starting to roll out FTTH (fibre to the home) in a big way. Singapore has it, France is trialling 100Mbps in Paris (four times as fast as what BT plans for the distant future) before rolling it out elsewhere. It is growing in the US, Japan, South Korea and Scandinavia. Years ago people could be forgiven for arguing that there would never be any content to send down the pipes. Not now. More powerful broadband has created its own demand as users watch web television, upload videos, even store histories of their lives in ways that could never have been contemplated by the architects of the net who made download speeds much faster than upload speeds. Britain has to be among the high-bandwidth countries of the future. It won&apos;t be long before the expansion of social networks joins up homes and communities directly through large digital screens enabling video contact with anyone and allowing families to monitor ageing relatives in case of accidents. Remote medicine and diagnosis, with all their explosive possibilities, are at an embryonic stage, as are virtual worlds which could turn the whole web into a three dimensional experience and change social relationships on a global scale. It may seem odd to raise all this when broadband connectivity in the UK is soaring. The problem is not one of width but depth. If the rest of the world adopts fibre faster than us we could be left behind in the race to make digital products that will dominate the future. When I blogged about this recently it got a number of responses, mainly critical, from people in the industry who knew far more than I did. Two points stood out. First, there is at present &quot;no financially credible application today that wants, needs or can even use 24Mb&quot; even if the system could cope with it, which it can&apos;t. The other was that today&apos;s copper network had been poorly maintained for years (&quot;every time a sparrow pisses ... there is a service crisis&quot;) and that a fibre replacement would solve this and future-proof the system. Given today&apos;s soaring copper price, maybe simple cost pressures will solve the problem for us. The proposition that we don&apos;t need fibre because there won&apos;t be demand for it reminds one of past pundits who predicted that the world wouldn&apos;t need more than a handful of computers. In this game, supply creates its own demand, as the recent explosion of web content shows. Developers have no incentive to conjure up innovative services if there is not enough capacity for their dreams to come true. YouTube or MySpace couldn&apos;t have succeeded on dialup networks. The biggest users of fibre will be products not yet invented. In the digital revolution who dares, wins. In recent years Britain has conducted a fascinating experiment in opening up competition to deliver services along the final copper mile of telephone connections. But this could be at the expense of financing a modern infrastructure on which the digital battles of the 21st century will be fought. It is time to bid copper a sad farewell.  \u00b7 vic.keegan@theguardian.com \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/01/aretheypotty", "sentences": ["The only other mooted location I&apos;ve been able to find, proposed by Disney in 2004, was Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-01T14:30:00Z", "title": "Are they potty?", "tags": ["Harry Potter", "Culture", "US news", "Books"], "article": "Hogwarts&apos; Castle ... in Florida? Yesterday&apos;s news that Universal Studios was planning to open &quot;The Wizarding World of Harry Potter&quot; in 2009 will have prodded the shriek-buttons of millions of young Potterheads, whose relentless campaign for a &quot;really fun holiday this time, Daaad&quot; will have ratcheted forward a few more irreversible notches. But for those parents who, through sheer diligence, have found themselves immersed in J K Rowling&apos;s world - fielding debates like &quot;what is the seventh horcrux?&quot; or &quot;is Snape really evil?&quot; with casual ease - this news clangs badly, like Quidditch armour dropped on a flagstone floor. The initial plans show a dark, cloudy, white-capped scene. If you&apos;ve ever toiled and broiled your way round a high-season Florida theme-park - where the dominant sensation is of being positioned 20 miles closer to the sun than seems strictly necessary - you&apos;ll wonder how they&apos;ll get the plastic snow to stay un-melted. But the next reaction is more aesthetic. Harry Potter - damp, cobwebby, sepulchral Harry Potter - in the land of the George Foreman Grill and the fluorescent fanny-pack? As the Potterheads might write on their fanfiction pages: Just. Not. Right. The JK Rowling who initially resisted filming the books because she feared that Harry would be too &quot;Americanised&quot; has clearly softened her stance on that particular assimilation. The new theme park will be part of the Islands of Adventure area, right next to Marvel Comics Land and Spielberg&apos;s Jurassic Park. To give the writer her due, Rowling&apos;s quality control over the various exploitations of her creation has been pretty fastidious. And as you watch your 10-year-old getting completely lost in a well-written 700-page book, steadily answering her vocabulary questions about what &quot;mortal peril&quot; or &quot;scrutinised&quot; means, you can imagine vast capitalist franchises based on much less worthy foundations. But I am here to complain, in a slightly peeved manner, about one aspect of the location of PotterWorld: that nobody ever seems to have thought, including Rowling, that it could have been based in Scotland. The only other mooted location I&apos;ve been able to find, proposed by Disney in 2004, was Singapore. And let&apos;s take for granted, in terms of the sensibility behind the books, that the Scottish climate might be a bit more appropriate than Orlando. Artistically, though there are many elements swirling around in the Harry Potter mythos, surely the Caledonian theme is the strongest. The Hogwarts Express may be leaving from King&apos;s Cross, but it hurtles northwards and greenwards, where it eventually arrives at a scene which Walter Scott and R L Stevenson laid the template for - a looming mist-wreathed castle on a mysterious loch. Hogwarts also touches on what Tom Nairn once called &quot;Balmorality&quot;: this is an isolated boarding school, surrounded by dark forests full of huntable creatures, and a stamping ground for half-blood princes. Though Rowling didn&apos;t get Sean Connery as her first choice for Professor Dumbledore, she did get Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall. And how much more Calvinist and Presbyterian a hero do you get than Harry Potter - literally marked on his head with the stain of evil, perpetually struggling with his own sense of being unworthy of his status? There&apos;s no doubt the Potter sensibility, and particularly the edifice of Hogwarts, is pre-dominantly Scottish. But I want to gently suggest that not only could the theme park have been built in Scotland, maybe it should have been too. The burden of responsibility falls very lightly on Rowling, and more heavily on the deficit of strategic power in Scottish politics and society. The Bristolian Rowling is about as naturalised an adoptive Scot as you could imagine - married to a Scottish-born anaesthetist, Neil Murray, both living and working in Edinburgh and Perth, her children educated at local state schools, with Gordon Brown a family friend. It&apos;s also well known that the very genesis of the Potter books couldn&apos;t have happened without two kinds of benefit from the state in Scotland - unemployment benefit as a single mother, and a grant of \u00a38000 from the Scottish Arts Council to help her stabilise her finances and complete the first book, The Chamber of Secrets. Bring the fiction and the biography together, and you can see why Rowling might have considered that her great return gift to Scotland - as one of the enabling conditions for her mighty empire - would be a global-standard tourist attraction, based on some aspect of the Potter mythology. The bigger problem by far is that, over the last decade of mounting Potter-mania, there has been no executive power in Scotland strong enough, or imaginative enough, to give Rowling a clear option to base such a theme park in its natural home. That weakness might be beginning to change, with the end of Labour rule in Scotland this May and the arrival of an SNP government. But it seems to me quite an indictment of the Scottish tourism industry (with its own resplendent quango Visit Scotland) that the possibility, to my hearing, has never even been raised - particularly given the steady drone about tourism being our &quot;biggest industry of the future&quot;. Anyone familiar with the Scottish landscape, watching the movie&apos;s tracking shots around a simulated Hogwarts&apos; castle, could easily identify possible locations. And it&apos;s not that we can&apos;t build extraordinary and world-class new edifices: take the Scottish Parliament building, followed soon by Zaha Hadid&apos;s Transport Museum in Glasgow (though hopefully we&apos;d have learned enough about managing costs from the former). The cachet of the world&apos;s biggest arts festival in Edinburgh - whose literary credentials, with the book festival and the Unesco&apos;s award of first ever &quot;City of Literature&quot;, are unparalleled - might have provided a less crass, more resonant overlay to the project. Meaning as much storytelling, creativity and drama, as robotic postal owls and first-person-shooter wand action. The technological challenges would have to be just as enthusiastically met, however: I know I wouldn&apos;t get my daughter through its gates if there weren&apos;t at least one near-authentic Quidditch ride in the building. And a properly animated Death Eater that frightened her right out of her Converses. All in all, though, I suspect that Scotland has missed the coracle here - not enough sovereignty, and vision, and maybe capability, at the crucial moment. In any case, it looks like all remaining Scottish ingenuity is going to be steered in the direction of clean coal capture, wave machines and wind farms. Ah well. Personally, I will resist the propaganda to haul myself to the state of the hanging chad, and strap on my Quidditch roller-coaster harness and eat melting Bertie Botts&apos; Every Flavor (sic) Beans, until the very last minute. And even then, I will probably travel under the command of the Snape Army.

In Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, Umaru Yar&apos;Adua has just been sworn in as the new president. Resplendent in white robes, he offers himself to the Nigerian people as their &quot;servant leader&quot;. How touching, although possibly lifted from Tony Blair&apos;s comments when he became prime minister. &quot;I&apos;ll be a good listener... and serve this nation with honesty, transparency, accountability, absolute fear of God and with absolute humility&quot;, adds Mr Yar&apos;Adua. Which all sounds admirable until you consider the fact that Mr Yar&apos;Adua has just been &quot;elected&quot; in one of the most fraudulent polls ever conducted anywhere in the world. I know that because I was in Nigeria in April when the elections took place, and not only saw it all but also spoke to many experienced election monitors who witnessed it too. Having a chat with one of them in Abuja after the dreadful presidential poll of April 21, he told me that he had been discussing the election with two of his colleagues, who between them all had observed over a hundred elections throughout the developing world over the past 20 years or so. None of them had ever seen anything as bad as Nigeria 2007. The EU, normally masters of diplomatic nuance in these matters, baldly declared that the elections were &quot;not credible&quot;. In some places, events bore a closer resemblance to a coup d&apos;\u00e9tat than an exercise in democracy. The people responsible for the rigging, the cheating, the stealing of ballot boxes, the fake results and all the rest of it were mainly those from the ruling People&apos;s Democratic Party, overseen by the outgoing president Olegun Obasanjo. And so the ruling oligarchy just hands on power to its own. It was another example of what one Nigerian official has called political &quot;gangsterism&quot;. And the rewards for such gangsterism are fabulous; all this takes place in Africa&apos;s largest oil producer, where some state governments, mainly in the oil-producing Delta region, command budgets that run to over $1bn. And to put that figure in perspective, it is quite a bit more that the whole national budgets of some other west African states. No wonder, perhaps, that the politicians will go to such crooked lengths to hang onto office, or make sure that their mates get in instead. And in Nigeria, most of that money at state and federal level will remain in the hands of politicians; little of it will be spent on services such as schools, hospitals and roads. Having achieved office by foul means, the politicians carry on as before. As the head of Nigeria&apos;s own anti-corruption agency asserted last year, during the period from the country&apos;s independence in 1960 to 1999, when Mr Obasajo was first elected, Nigeria&apos;s politicians got through $380bn in corruption and waste. And just to put that figure in perspective, it&apos;s the equivalent of about two-thirds of all the aid from foreign countries given to the whole of Africa in the same timespan. And you can probably add quite a lot on to the corruption-count since 1999 as well. I dwell at length on Nigeria because it is a perfect current example of a wider phenomenon across Africa; the continent&apos;s problems are largely one of politics, not of money. Nigeria is a wealthy country, yet most of its people live in poverty (over 70% on the equivalent of less than $1 a day). Blaming Africa&apos;s corrupt &quot;big men&quot; for its problems is, of course, an old argument. But the fact remains that the systemic deficiencies of many African countries&apos; political heirarchies still do more than anything else to hinder their development. And western countries getting all pious about some of the more &quot;promising&quot; African leaders - such as Mr Obasanjo - wilfully turn a blind eye to their failings, and end up supporting charades like the Nigerian elections which then legitimise gangster politicians. Foreign donors spent about $6m funding the Nigerian elections. What a dreadful waste of money. The depressing feature of all this for Africa-watchers is that in many respects African countries are becoming much more sophisticated, while their political systems, and their leaders, lag far behind. Nigeria, for example, has made huge strides in the management of its public finances and debt, it can now issue bonds on the international money markets: but its politics still look antediluvian. The same is true of countries as diverse as Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda and Senegal. Almost every African country now pays at least rhetorical respect to multi-party elections, political competition, democratic elections and the like. The New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) is supposed to hold everyone to account on these matters, but in practice, far too often these investigations are made into nothing more than a sham to cover up the same old authoritarian practices. And the leaders who benefit from this watch each others&apos; backs in their cosy clubs such as the African Union and the Southern African Development Community. It was the latter that let Robert Mugabe completely off the hook after his latest round of thuggery in March when southern African leaders met up with him and uttered not one word of public condemnation. So it was a nice, bright, green light to him to go on ruining his country. By the same token there was scarcely a squeak out of the African Union, or anyone else, after the Nigerian elections. It is ordinary Africans who continue to suffer at the hands of their politicians, and well-meaning western aid will make a lot less difference than it should do, unless the continent&apos;s politics change. That is up to Africans themselves to bring about. Too often, what people do achieve is done despite governments, not because of them; the revolution in mobile telephony sweeping through the continent is one example. The extraordinary growth in privately run schools is another. Open societies and democracies do not necessarily guarantee economic prosperity; the postwar experience of the Asian tigers such as Malaysia and Singapore prove that. But Africa does show that corrupt and venal politics ruin comparatively rich and prosperous countries. And sadly, continues to do so.

Everything we ordered from a menu that gathers authentic dishes from the Straits of Malacca, which it informs us is &quot;a giant melting pot of culture, race and religion&quot;, was excellent. However, not anticipating the generosity of the servings, we ordered grotesquely. Although history teaches us to fear the twice named (Humbert Humbert, the Lolita paedophile; Sirhan Sirhan, the Bobby Kennedy assassin; Neville Neville, the father of Everton and England defender Philip), the rule can be safely reversed here - gado gado was a vast portion of wonderfully fresh vegetables, boiled egg and rice cake in a warm and creamy peanut sauce, while otak-otak proved to be no fewer than six delicious fishcakes wrapped in banana leaf and served upright to resemble piscine cupcakes. Chicken satay was juicy and immaculate, and also came in a half-dozen; spring rolls were crisp and greaseless; and acar brought together crunchy carrots, beans and peppers in a gently chillified pickling vinegar. On the wall beside our table was a mural listing various things to be afraid of, and while some suggested phobias were sensible enough (turmoil, for instance, and mother), we&apos;d already eaten so much that &quot;fear of being thin&quot; had come to seem needlessly sardonic. Even so, my sister and I plugged gamely on with the main courses, and splendid they were, too. Spare ribs were great, fat, fleshy brutes baked in a delectable sweet-and-sour sauce, and beef rendang saw thick chunks of surprisingly tender beef (well, you don&apos;t expect a decent cut at \u00a36.80) drenched in a gravy that gratifyingly tingled the tongue despite the leavening presence of coconut milk. Egg-fried rice with prawns and pork was perfect, but my pick from this crowded field was ko lo mee (mee being Malay for noodles, which dominate the menu; it&apos;s mee, mee, mee with these people, all the time): braised egg noodles, infused with a glorious, sesame oil and rice wine hot-and-sour twang, served with barbecued pork and floating on a delicate broth. The service was warm and smiley, and the bill absurdly small for the quality of food and the size of the servings. (Asked if we wanted to take anything home, it was no surprise to hear my sister say, &quot;How about the chef?&quot;). This place is an absolute corker in any language, and cannot be recommended too warmly even to those with a deep-rooted terror of south-east Asian modernist cafes. Be unafraid, in fact.

Now released by the Syrian government, he paid tribute last week to Irrepressible.info, the joint campaign run by Amnesty International and The Observer which calls for an end to the persecution of bloggers by repressive regimes. &apos;This always made me stronger,&apos; he said. &apos;I no longer felt that I had been a mere straw in the wind.&apos; Irrepressible.info has just turned one year old. Its impact will be debated on Wednesday when an event, &apos;Some People Think the Internet is a Bad Thing: The Struggle for Freedom of Expression in Cyberspace&apos;, is held at Amnesty&apos;s headquarters in Shoreditch, east London, and webcast around the world. Among the speakers will be Martha Lane Fox, the pioneering dotcom entrepreneur. The campaign - launched 45 years after a powerful article in this newspaper led to the founding of Amnesty - recognises the internet as a new frontier in the struggle for human rights. It demands that governments stop censoring websites, blocking emails and imprisoning bloggers, and calls on major corporations such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo! to stop colluding with them. Nearly 68,000 people have pledged their support so far, including Bob Geldof, Chris Martin and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It was last August that The Observer reported on the plight of Shihabi, an English-language teacher detained in Syria for activities including posting pro-democracy articles online. Amnesty warned that Shihabi was at risk of torture and, according to his testimony, the fear proved well founded. &apos;I was incarcerated in a cell in a basement for two months,&apos; the 52-year-old said via email. &apos;The cell was 2x1 metres. I never got out, except to WC [and] for investigation and torture. After that, I was moved to Adra Prison in Damascus. I was put in a collective cell, with about 40 criminals. Fresh air was very fine, but the food was always disgusting. &apos;My eyes were shut with a piece of leather round my head and my hands were cuffed behind my back. Almost every 10 days, when I was in the cell, they got me out, ordered me to lie down on my belly and raised my legs up. They set to hitting me on my feet in an attempt to compel me to co-operate with them, ie to be an informer. Every time they hit me about 25 hits.&apos; Shihabi said the support of the Irrepressible.info campaign had been a source of strength throughout his ordeal, which ended with a presidential amnesty in January. &apos;The campaign was something else, it was great,&apos; he continued. &apos;Every time my family came to meet me in prison, my wife or my sister used to tell me that Amnesty International, Reporters without Borders, The Observer and the Guardian are saying so and so, and calling on the Syrian regime to release all of you. I narrated every bit my family told me about this subject to the other prisoners. Though they had never heard of those organisations or papers, they listened with open eyes. &apos;After my release, many intellectuals came to me and talked about the importance of the above campaign, especially your article, as it was published not only on the internet. One of them had a copy and took it out of his pocket. They assured me that campaign had compromised the Syrian junta.&apos; The importance of the internet in defending human rights has inspired Martha Lane Fox to lend her support. The co-founder of Lastminute.com, now a board member at Marks &amp; Spencer and trustee of the anti-death penalty charity Reprieve, said: &apos;Freedom of expression and freedom of speech are fundamental, and the technology that&apos;s enabled it more than any other is the internet, so it&apos;s very important to keep fighting to make the internet what it was originally intended to be, which is disruptive and chaotic and about people being empowered to do amazing things.&apos; She added: &apos;The things that strike me now as so extraordinary about this technology is that it gives an outlet to people in the most extreme situations. Whether they can write their own blogs or communicate by email, it can be a channel through which people have a voice in an otherwise repressive country, and that&apos;s fantastic and worth preserving at the highest cost.&apos; The challenge facing Irrepressible.info is spelled out by a new report from the OpenNet Initiative, an international university consortium, which found that online censorship is growing around the world. Of 41 countries surveyed, 25 showed evidence of content filtering by governments: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Burma, China, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, UAE, Uzbekistan, Vietnam and Yemen. Professor Ron Deibert of the OpenNet Initiative said: &apos;We can&apos;t take the internet for granted. Most people think of it as a seamless web, but our research shows it&apos;s being carved up and controlled..&apos; A new Irrepressible.info website launches at Wednesday&apos;s event, incorporating a news aggregator enabling people to &apos;tag&apos; items about internet freedom and repression and post them to the site. Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International, whose article in The Observer ignited the campaign a year ago, said: &apos;We think it&apos;s been a brilliant success. We&apos;d only set out to get 30,000 people to sign the petition and we&apos;ve got over 65,000. We presented that to the UN&apos;s Internet Governance Forum, and I think all the commentators on that forum were clear that human rights had a central part to bear. One of my colleagues told me that when the Chinese government representatives got to their feet and said there was no internet repression in China, everybody just laughed.&apos; A webcast of the event, which starts at 6.30pm on Wednesday, will be online at www.amnesty.org.uk/webcast."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/03/economicpolicy.politics", "sentences": ["As the International Monetary Fund warned way back in its April 2004 world economic outlook: &apos;Globalisation cannot be relied upon to keep a lid on inflationary pressures...

The answer is they were the only years, before the advent of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee in 1997, when inflation in the UK was within the target introduced by Gordon Brown. That the retail prices index had risen by less than 2.5 per cent in only a handful of the years between 1948 and 1996 was one reason why I was so concerned about the new monetary arrangements. It seemed a pretty tall order to expect the MPC to hit the newly ordained target (subsequently revised and redefined, to conform with European standards, to 2 per cent for the new consumer prices index), although it is a fair point that one of the aims was to rid the UK of the inflationary culture of the post-war decades. To some extent this had already been achieved under the premiership of John Major and the chancellorships of Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke, as illustrated by the inflation statistics of 1.6 per cent for 1993, 2.5 per cent in 1994 and 2.4 per cent in 1996. But measures of that mysterious concept known as &apos;inflation expectations&apos; came down further after the introduction of the MPC and almost 10 years elapsed before the governor of the Bank of England had to write to the Chancellor to explain why inflation was more than 1 per cent away from target. Now, it is a truth almost universally acknowledged that the impact of globalisation has been of enormous benefit in helping the Bank of England and other central banks to be credited for keeping inflation low. Those versed in Marxist economics will recognise a world in which the aspirations for higher wages of tens of millions of workers in this country, and of hundreds of millions around the world, are being thwarted by the triumph of global capitalism. We have witnessed a shift in the balance of power from workers to entrepreneurs, to financiers and, not to put too fine a point upon it, to old-fashioned capitalists. As MPC member David Blanchflower said in a lecture last week: &apos;Workers these days seem increasingly aware that they can be replaced by immigrants and/or that their employer can move his or her production facilities abroad. This limits workers&apos; bargaining power. These pressures manifest themselves in the recent low settlements figures.&apos; Not all wages are ground down. As the estimable Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) points out in its June economic outlook, &apos;many low skilled-workers are [still] providing services that cannot be imported&apos;. As for chief executives, the financial sector and men who still kick a ball around when they are grown up, &apos;globalised&apos; competition has produced a world where, when it comes to earnings, the sky (or Sky) is the limit. Incidentally, people who still have social consciences and who are worried about the way the world is going can take heart from a paper by the eminent labour economist David Metcalf, of the London School of Economics. Its very title - &apos;Why has the British national minimum wage had little or no impact on employment?&apos; - gives the game away. For all those predictions by (usually) right-wing economists that a minimum wage would produce economic disaster, it hasn&apos;t happened. Indeed, Metcalf concludes: &apos;The national minimum wage has raised the real and relative pay of low-paid workers, tempered wage inequality and contributed to the narrowing of the gender wage gap.&apos; It has not had adverse effects on employment; nor has it been inflationary. But there may be a limit to the benign impact of globalisation on inflation. As the International Monetary Fund warned way back in its April 2004 world economic outlook: &apos;Globalisation cannot be relied upon to keep a lid on inflationary pressures... Strong global growth and diminishing economic slack have reduced the restraining impact of declining import prices on inflation... the possibility of further, partly globalisation-related, commodity price increases adds to the upside risk from the external sector.&apos; As I reported from the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Singapore last autumn, it was clear that inflation was once again becoming a worry for central banks. The recent trend of oil and other commodity prices has reinforced the fears of the hawks. Bill White, the chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements, now has many followers with regard to his concern about excess liquidity and an orgy of risk-taking in the markets. Again, in its June economic outlook the OECD echoes the warnings of the Bank of England&apos;s chief economist, Charles Bean, and others, that &apos;core&apos; inflation measures, which exclude &apos;volatile&apos; items such as energy and food, may be misleading. The OECD notes: &apos;They suffer from the shortcoming that they reflect the systematic downward impact of globalisation on manufactured goods prices, but not the possibly systematic, though volatile, upward impact on commodity prices.&apos; We now learn that the nascent, politically correct agricultural shift from the cultivation of food to production of &apos;crops for fuel&apos; is affecting food prices, and that blue ear disease has produced rocketing pork prices in China. For inflation hawks, this offers a chance to make something out of a sow&apos;s ear. In any case, it is evident that the Bank of England has a renewed resolve about inflation. This could mean that the MPC will be in no position to lower interest rates on demand, even though the accumulated effects of previous rises appear finally to be making themselves felt. Brown&apos;s target could yet prove to be historically ambitious."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinjacques", "sentences": ["He is presently a visiting senior fellow at the National University of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-03T15:02:00Z", "title": "Full profile", "tags": [], "article": "Martin Jacques is a writer and broadcaster.

Two weeks after losing the Irish Open in a play-off to Padraig Harrington, Dredge was in sight of making perfect amends - and becoming \u00a3250,000 richer - when he stood on the last tee one shot ahead. No Welsh player has lifted the trophy, but when the South African Richard Sterne in the group ahead sank a five-foot birdie to complete a five under par inward 29 Dredge suddenly had to par to force another play-off. However, for the second day running his drive failed to carry the right-hand bunker, he came up way short of the green by catching too much sand and then he lipped out from six feet. &quot;I really feel this is a kick in the nuts,&quot; said the 33-year-old after the most crushing bogey of his career. It cost him more than \u00a3150,000. By finishing in a four-way tie for second place rather than a two-way share he will just miss out on earning an exemption into next month&apos;s Open through the world&apos;s top 50. As with the US Open, which he has still to play in, Dredge has controversially decided not to compete in the 36-hole qualifier at Sunningdale on July 2, but there are other ways in. Sterne is the one who is no longer searching for a place at Carnoustie. Third in last week&apos;s PGA Championship at Wentworth - he was the one to suffer last-green agony there - the 25-year-old is now into the game&apos;s top 40 for the first time. The two of them had both produced superb fightbacks after looking as if they might become also-rans in the title race. Sterne birdied four of the last five holes for a 65 and 13 under par total of 263 on the par 69 Roman Road lay-out. Dredge, joint overnight leader, fell four adrift by covering the first eight holes in a desperately disappointing two over, but then birdied the ninth and 10th and had three more in a row from the 15th. After playing a bunker shot to four feet on the long 16th to make it a five-way tie at the top he produced an even better approach to the 17th and with a seven-foot putt led on his own for the first time. There was to be no happy ending, however. &quot;I thought I needed a par to win and I thought I had carried the bunker on the last,&quot; he said after his bogey had dropped him into a tie with the Danes Soren Kjeldsen and Mads Vibe-Hastrup and also Singapore&apos;s Mardan Mamat, who closed with a best-of-the-week 62. Sterne, who lost a play-off to compatriot Anton Haig in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand in March, said: &quot;To get the breakthrough means a lot. It&apos;s always difficult when you are knocking on the door and you don&apos;t win.&quot; Scot Gary Orr, England&apos;s Paul Broadhurst and Ireland&apos;s Gary Murphy were among others who still had a chance entering the closing stretch, but Murphy had to settle for a share of sixth place and the other two were in a tie for eighth. Colin Montgomerie fired a 63, his lowest round since an opening 62 in the event last year, to leap from 50th to 20th.

However, he warned that a boom in plane orders was making aircraft more expensive to acquire, while trade union pressure could increase wages and a small economic shock might be enough to cause serious problems for the industry. &quot;We are now a $470bn industry and a profit of $5bn is peanuts,&quot; Mr Bisignani said in a keynote address at the IATA annual general meeting in Vancouver. &quot;We need $40bn just to cover the cost of capital. We are moving in the right direction, but the financial hold is deep. &quot;The industry is $200bn in debt. Our financial foundation is weak. Some economists predict another five years of strong growth but nobody can predict shocks, and even a small one could have an impact.&quot;  The fifth largest carrier in the US, Northwest Airlines, emerged from bankruptcy last week - meaning that, for the first time in five years none of the large US carriers was operating under protection from creditors. Analysts now expect the US industry to consolidate. Mr Bisignani added that the environment was the &quot;toughest climb&quot; of all the challenges the industry faces.  Aviation accounts for 1.6% of global carbon dioxide emissions but generates a much higher proportion of column inches in the debate about which industries should be reined in over their contribution to global warming.  The IATA boss singled out the UK as one of the key instigators of the industry&apos;s &quot;reputation crisis&quot;, pointing to Gordon Brown&apos;s decision to double air passenger duty on all flights out of Britain. &quot;We are paying \u00a31bn for his green credentials,&quot; he said. &quot;He helped the UK budget, but what has he done for the environment? He hasn&apos;t planted any trees, but he is lost in the woods.&quot;  Mr Bisignani added that the actions of other European governments were &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;inconsistent&quot;, underlined by the failure to agree a unified air traffic control system across the continent.  However, he admitted that carbon dioxide emissions from aviation companies were growing, saying that was &quot;politically unacceptable&quot;, and challenged the industry to meet a target of zero carbon dioxide emissions within 50 years. He also laid down four short-term goals to improve the industry&apos;s green credentials - improve air traffic management and save 35m tonnes of C02 per year, introduce a global emissions trading scheme for airlines, construct a zero emissions aircraft within 50 years, and establish &quot;IATA Project Green&quot; to help airlines share environmentally friendly measures.

At least, none that come to mind as he walks to class after a quick surf, something he does almost every day. Natasha Krichefski, 22, from London, is spending a year at the University of New South Wales as part of her Edinburgh University undergraduate music degree. &quot;A masters out here has great appeal,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m seriously considering music therapy at the University of Western Sydney, although an equivalent course is also offered in London.&quot; In the first semester of 2006, there were 1,801 UK students like Sheane and Krichefski on undergraduate, postgraduate or exchange programmes in Australian universities. This is peanuts compared with the numbers of students from China (40,292), Malaysia (24,952) and Singapore (20,714). But Australian universities are paying more attention than might be expected to their UK student numbers. Several of them believe that in two years&apos; time, when the cap on English tuition fees - currently at \u00a33,000 - is likely to be lifted by the government, more of our students will head &quot;down under&quot;. Living costs are, after all, much cheaper in Australia than in the UK. If fees at some English universities stretch to \u00a35,000 or more from 2009, Australian fees for international students will seem comparable. For example, at the University of Wollongong, a bachelor of arts costs an international student Aus$16,500 (\u00a36,863) a year. Christine Cox, head of the international office at the University of New South Wales, says: &quot;People are saying that once the cap has been lifted on UK tuition fees - if it is - we might see a growth in the number of undergraduates. We are looking closely at this. The UK student market is fairly recent for us. Our roots are in south-east Asian student recruitment.&quot; Charles Tyler, from the University of Sydney&apos;s international office, agrees. &quot;We are predicting a possible increase in UK undergraduates if the UK introduces higher fees. But we are still getting our name on the map in the UK. We expect to see a gradual increase, perhaps as the differential between the cost of a UK education and an Australian one decreases. &quot;Among factors limiting any sudden increase will, of course, be the cost of international travel and the savings on accommodation for students based at home. The luxury of relocating to Australia for a degree will still be only for a few, but a few more than before the cap is lifted - if it is lifted.&quot; Less cautious are the educational agents whose business it is to recruit UK students to Australian campuses. Charlotte Hurst, manager of Study Overseas, which recruits for four Australian universities and seven colleges from a base in the UK, says: &quot;Student mobility is increasing worldwide; information is more widely and readily available through the internet and direct contact with Australian academics at education fairs in the UK. &quot;When the current cap is lifted, we are likely to see an exponential increase in the number of UK students considering Australia as a study destination. If fees rise to \u00a35,000 or \u00a37,000 or more, Australia becomes a more economical option for parents who are comparing the cost of different types of university education.&quot; Michael Shattock, visiting professor at the Institute of Education, is not convinced. He says we should not assume that the cap will be lifted and points out that Australian university fees still tend to be higher than the US ivy league. &quot;The beneficiaries of any increase in UK students going to Australian universities will be Melbourne and Sydney,&quot; he says, &quot;because they are the brand leaders for UK students, but it&apos;s important to realise that fees are quite high in Oz.&quot; Australian universities certainly hope their predictions will come true, though. They are keen to diversify their pool of international students, particularly from countries other than China. Prospective Chinese students may be put off if they hear that they make up 30% of the students on campus. Recruiting Asian students has become more difficult. Students from India and China are increasingly studying in their home countries. Countries that were once consumers are becoming exporters of education and attracting their own international students. For now, though, numbers from China remain strong, at 40,292, up from 38,619 last year. But when you add to the mix that the Australian government has reduced funding for universities, it is easy to see why UK students - paying higher fees than the locals - are an attractive prospect. While a rise in UK students could be wishful thinking for universities, the same cannot be said for the technical and further education colleges. These institutions, known as Tafes, have had a 22.7% growth in enrolments from UK students since last March; some 1,184 signed up this year. The most popular courses are designed to alleviate Australia&apos;s skills shortages in areas such as hairdressing, building studies and IT. Some, including hairdressing, even give permanent residency on completion. Trudy Sharpe, a 32-year-old from Lincolnshire, is studying to become a hairdresser at a Tafe on the Gold Coast. She is undecided about whether she is going to emigrate permanently, but says she knows people &quot;who believe permanent residency leads to a better future for their children and better prospects&quot;. If this trend continues, what will it mean for UK higher and further education? &quot;The effect of more UK students going abroad is unknown,&quot; says David Pilsbury, chief executive of the Worldwide Universities Network. &quot;The positive effects might include further increasing the diversity of UK campuses and more informal ambassadors for the UK overseas. Much depends on the quality of the students who leave and whether they return. If some of the best leave and then return, they will bring welcome international perspectives. If they do not return, then the UK faces a bleak future.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/07/bae13", "sentences": ["The list for 2005 comprised Greece, Japan, Malaysia, Oman, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and the US."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-07T09:08:12Z", "title": "BAE files: The Defence Export Services Organisation", "tags": ["The BAE files", "UK news"], "article": "No other industry has a well-funded government unit solely devoted to flogging its products around the world.

Within three years US arms sales had quadrupled. Healey turned to Donald Stokes [biography], the head of Leyland motors, asking him to do a &quot;crash job&quot; on setting up a British equivalent. Stokes recommended a &quot;small but very high-powered central arms sales organisation with the MoD&quot;. It was to be headed by a businessman &quot;with a strong personality, drive, organising ability, experience of exporting and an instinct for business&quot;. He would report directly to ministers. Until then, civil servants had passively responded to inquiries from overseas for British arms. Stokes envisaged the new body as being a &quot;spearhead in the thrust for important overseas orders&quot;. Healey agreed, announcing the setting-up of the Defence Sales Organisation on January 25 1966. DSO, he said, would secure Britain its &quot;rightful share&quot; of the world&apos;s arms sales&apos;. In time, it would change its name to Deso. It has succeeded. Garwood has said: &quot;Over the past 40 years we&apos;ve gone from a position where British defence exports were not terribly significant, to where we are now the second-largest defence exporter in the world, number one in the world after the Americans.&quot; The arms companies are satisfied. In surveys, they say that more than 75% of arms export orders are landed with the help of Deso. After it was set up, Deso expanded steadily. Back in the 1960s Stokes believed that 15-20 employees would be enough. By 1994 the total number of staff was 708. Nowadays there are 450. They seek out potential orders from foreign governments, tipping off arms companies and then promoting companies&apos; wares to those governments. They also attend trade fairs around the world to tout British military equipment, and arrange for members of the British armed forces to travel abroad and demonstrate UK firms&apos; equipment to prospective buyers. In addition, military attaches in embassies abroad spend up to a third of their time promoting arms sales. All this effort is aimed at securing as many contracts as possible. As Charles Masefield [biography], one-time head of Deso, remarked: &quot;Every order is fought to the death.&quot; Deso costs the taxpayer \u00a313m a year. Much of this is channelled into selling military equipment to a single regime: Saudi Arabia. Ministers have admitted that &quot;around 40%&quot; of the staff is dedicated to this task. A copy of Deso&apos;s staff directory showed that in 2005, 161 civil servants worked for the &quot;Saudi armed forces project&quot;, distributed between Britain and the Middle East. As well as in Saudi Arabia, there are 22 Deso offices scattered around the globe. Each year Deso draws up a list of &quot;priority&quot; countries for its sales effort. The list for 2005 comprised Greece, Japan, Malaysia, Oman, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and the US. The most recent list is deemed by Deso to be too commercially sensitive to publish. The head of Deso always comes from the arms industry. A senior executive from one of the arms companies is seconded to lead the organisation for a number of years, often returning to their company or the arms industry afterwards. The head is paid a wage from the civil service, which is then topped up by the arms industry. The heads since 1966 have been: \u00b7 1966-1969 Raymond Brown (seconded from Racal) \u00b7 1969-1976 Lester Suffield (British Leyland) \u00b7 1976-1981 Ronald Ellis (British Leyland) \u00b7 1981-1985 James Blyth (Lucas Aerospace) \u00b7 1985-1989 Colin Chandler (British Aerospace) \u00b7 1989-1994 Alan Thomas (Raytheon) \u00b7 1994-1998 Charles Masefield (BAe) \u00b7 1998-2002 Tony Edwards (TI Group) \u00b7 2002-present Alan Garwood (MBDA). The head has a direct line to ministers, and reports in the first instance to the arms sales minister (currently Lord Drayson), going higher if necessary. BAE openly said that Masefield enjoyed &quot;direct access to Major and Blair&quot; while he was Deso head. This means that arms companies are given privileged admission into the heart of government. Anti-arms trade campaigners are pressing for Deso to be closed down."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/07/conservation", "sentences": ["Ivory from Zambia was sent to Malawi for packing then transported to Mozambique for shipping to Japan via Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-07T09:21:16Z", "title": "Governments 'ignoring environmental crime'", "tags": ["Environment", "Conservation", "Organised crime", "World news"], "article": "Organised crime syndicates working with corrupt government officials have turned environmental crime into a multi-billion pound business that is rivalling the drugs trade, according to a new report published today. The profits to be made from the illegal trade in everything from Asian big cats to Tibetan antelope and the growth of illegal logging is now creating instability in many countries, claims the report by the international Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). The agency, which carries out undercover operations to expose environmental crime, said: &quot;The frequent involvement of government officials links environmental crime to issues of corruption and bad governance, highlighting its contribution to cultures of lawlessness, impunity and social instability.&quot; Cross-border crime The EIA said many of the crimes against wildlife involved gangs in several countries, a point illustrated when a syndicate in the illegal ivory trade was exposed by the agency in 2002. The syndicate consisted of criminals from south-east Asia and Africa who between them poached thousands of elephants and made hundreds of millions of dollars. Ivory from Zambia was sent to Malawi for packing then transported to Mozambique for shipping to Japan via Singapore. Fake companies and the bribery of customs officials eased the passage of the goods. Such illegal trade has a knock-on effect on Zambia&apos;s burgeoning tourism industry, claims the report, entitled Upholding the Law. As many of the elephants killed for the ivory trade come from South Luangwa national park, a prime tourist destination, their disappearance threatens the tourist industry which is vital to the country&apos;s economy. The report, published as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) holds its annual summit, calls on governments to take wildlife crimes more seriously. It concludes: &quot;Until wildlife crime is taken seriously by governments and viewed on a par with other transnational organised crime, the plunder will continue, damaging biodiversity, threatening species with extinction, stealing from local and national economies and perpetuating corruption.&quot; Political agenda Julian Newman of EIA said the main problem was resources. &quot;Every country has its priorities in terms of where it puts its enforcement personnel. This whole issue has to go up the political agenda,&quot; he said. China has now replaced Japan as the biggest market for illegal ivory, said Mr Newman. While most attention was focused on the plight of elephants and tigers reptiles, amphibians and rare birds were also at risk as they represented major profits for organised crime. The report comes a week after Scotland Yard warned that its successful wildlife crime unit could be scaled back unless it finds outside funding to pay for two civilian officers attached to the unit. Over the past decade, the unit has been responsible for major seizures of products made from tigers, rhinos, bears, elephants and reptiles."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/08/britishamericantobaccobusiness", "sentences": ["BAT is selling the stake to SUTL, a Singapore-based trading group that invests in business ventures in South East Asia.", "Under the terms of the agreement, BAT will license its Craven A brand to the Singaporean investment group for manufacture and sale in the North Korean domestic market."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-08T15:40:41Z", "title": "Tobacco company pulls out of North Korea", "tags": ["Business", "British American Tobacco"], "article": "British American Tobacco is pulling out of North Korea, but insisted the move had nothing to do with political pressure.

When The Magic Gourd opens at the end of this month, the Chinese-language film will mark a departure for Walt Disney and a step-change in its charm offensive in emerging markets. The Magic Gourd is Disney&apos;s maiden co-production in China and if all goes to plan it will be the first of many locally made, Disney-branded films around the world. The creator of Mickey Mouse first made its way into China in the 1930s and already reaps a healthy profit from toy stores across the country. But the Magic Kingdom is no longer content with exporting shows, films and characters. Disney is now on a mission to woo even more families in countries such as Russia, India and Korea by giving them their specially created Disney tales. Thomas Staggs, chief finance officer, has earmarked $100m (\u00a350m) for locally made films. That may seem like peanuts for a group with annual revenues of more than $34bn but Mr Staggs stresses it is a clear commitment to TV shows and feature films not made in the US. Unveiling the plans on a trip to London, he refused to divulge details of what will be made where. But he hinted at a string of indigenous films and television shows in both emerging and developed markets. Wherever it is - and he mentions &quot;capabilities in South America&quot; - the locally made, Disney-branded strategy is motivated by two business benefits. &quot;We make our brands more relevant to the local market. If you produce in-market it gives you the opportunity to produce something that is going to be resonant in a different way than the simple export programme,&quot; says Mr Staggs. &quot;And we also give ourselves access to a broader marketplace. If you go round the world, local content can be anywhere from an important part of total media consumption to a dominant part. In some markets like China you can get much greater distribution of a film made in the country for that country.&quot; Film companies have had an eye on the global marketplace for years. David Miller, entertainment and media analyst at the brokerage Sanders Morris Harris in Los Angeles, highlights studios&apos; use of foreign actors and storylines that boost a films&apos; relevance for non-US audiences. The point to bear in mind as a film-maker is where the market is growing fastest, he says. &quot;How these films play internationally is far more important than how they play in the United States. In terms of overall screen count, here in the US we have about 32,000 movie screens and that number hasn&apos;t really changed in about six years. But the number of screens abroad is going up, fairly dramatically in places like Russia, Vietnam and China.&quot; Disney&apos;s latest Pirates of the Caribbean instalment, At World&apos;s End, epitomises the attempt to achieve global appeal. It features scenes in Singapore and an international cast and characters. What is different about The Magic Gourd production is its attempt to wholly serve one big market. The tale of a young boy who befriends an enchanted gourd is based on a classic Chinese novel by the children&apos;s author Zhang Tianyi. Featuring a soundtrack by the Chinese pop star Baby Zhang, it was a co-production with the state-run China Film Group and the Hong Kong-based Centro Digital Pictures. Media experts highlight other reasons for local co-productions beyond what Disney calls &quot;resonance&quot;. Joseph Lampel, a film industry expert from London&apos;s Cass Business School, said Disney&apos;s Chinese venture was no surprise. &quot;The Chinese government strictly controls theatrical release of foreign films into the domestic market,&quot; he says. &quot;Disney is therefore unable to fully leverage the powerful synergy between theatrical release and merchandising which it uses elsewhere. A co-produced film with Chinese content allows Disney to combine its technical skills with local content. This has the double advantages of neutralising restrictions on theatrical release within China, and increasing appeal to the Chinese market.&quot; The US entertainment group is keen to flag up that whatever it launches in developing economies, it has reached a scale where it has a clear advantage over rivals. It is making the most of the appeal of Disney products, whether it is films, toys or theme parks, says Andy Bird, head of Walt Disney International. So even when a film or character is locally made, the company&apos;s strategy relies on that creation bearing a clear Disney imprint - The Magic Gourd is described as featuring &quot;all the classic Disney storytelling elements&quot;. &quot;That ability to drive our different businesses under a common umbrella sets us aside from our peers and also allows us a degree of flexibility when we create our market entry strategy,&quot; says Mr Bird, who is charged with growing the business outside the US. &quot;Unlike other media companies that are largely focused around television and film, we do have many other strings to our bow ... we can look at the infrastructure and architecture of a particular country and work out the best way of entering it with the various businesses that we have.&quot; In India, Disney&apos;s focus so far has been on television. Last year it became the country&apos;s leading children&apos;s television group after acquiring the teenagers&apos; channel Hungama. In Latin America it has created local versions of TV shows such as Desperate Housewives. In Korea, it is trying to tap into the rapid evolution of mobile video. Russia also offers big opportunities in mobile because, like other emerging markets, there is a limited fixed-line infrastructure. &quot;In these markets you see a leapfrogging of technology at a far greater pace than you see in developed markets,&quot; says Mr Bird. More than eight decades after Walt Disney sold his first cartoons, the company is present all over the world in various guises. But Disney still feels it has more to do, even if the finance director is trying to temper the excitement somewhat. &quot;We want to move with measured impatience,&quot; says Mr Staggs. The mouse that roared  From its creation in 1923, the Walt Disney Company has grown into a global media, leisure and retail group with 133,000 employees and a market capitalisation of more than $70bn. It runs five theme parks across North America, Europe and Asia as well as a cruise line and holiday resorts. It owns a host of TV channels, including the ABC network in the US and a majority stake in the ESPN sports channels, and runs a distribution business selling hits such as Desperate Housewives and Lost. Disney&apos;s film division has been riding the Pirates of the Caribbean wave, which last year put it at the top of the global box office. It claims the latest instalment has smashed records. The merchandising business that Walt Disney started with Mickey Mouse in the 1920s has grown to notch up global retail sales of $23bn last year. There are more than 4,000 Disney Corner retail outlets in China, compared with 57 Disney Stores in the UK."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/12/chilldescendsonuschinarela", "sentences": ["Speaking at an International Institute for Strategic Studies conference in Singapore, Lt-General Zhang Qinsheng, deputy chief of the Chinese general staff, said US fears were exaggerated."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-12T20:00:00Z", "title": "Chill descends on US-China relations", "tags": ["US news", "China", "Japan", "Weapons technology", "Military", "Russia", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Even as the US struggles to stop relations with Russia plunging into deep freeze, a distinct chill has descended over its dealings with Beijing following a new Pentagon report on China&apos;s military build-up. Richard Nixon knew better than to antagonise both superpower rivals at once. No such wisdom troubles George Bush. Noting China&apos;s &quot;rapid rise as a regional political and economic power with global aspirations&quot;, the Pentagon complained of uncertainty surrounding its expanding military might and how it may be used. Beijing&apos;s short-term focus was &quot;military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait&quot;, it said. But it was also planning to project military power further afield in the Asia-Pacific region, in preparation for possible conflicts over resources or territory. The Pentagon took particular exception to the Chinese navy&apos;s development of a new fleet of five Jin-class ballistic missile submarines with enhanced, long-range nuclear weapons capabilities; the successful test in January of a direct-ascent, anti-satellite weapon that &quot;put at risk the assets of all space-faring nations and posed dangers to human space flight&quot;; and China&apos;s growing ability to counter US battlefield, space and cyberspace technologies in support of so-called &quot;area denial&quot; strategies. Challenging the communist party leadership&apos;s &quot;peaceful rise&quot; slogan, the US defence planners claimed &quot;China&apos;s actions in certain areas appear inconsistent with its declaratory policies and defence expenditures remain far above officially disclosed figures&quot;. And they highlighted two problems. While tensions with Japan had eased somewhat after last November&apos;s Beijing summit, &quot;territorial disputes in the East China Sea and China&apos;s efforts to block Japan&apos;s quest for a seat on the UN security council remain sources of friction&quot;. The report also warned that Taiwan, which Beijing deems a renegade territory but whose de facto independence is implicitly underwritten by the US, remained the most likely flashpoint. &quot;China&apos;s military modernisation and the deployment of advanced capabilities opposite the island have not eased, with the balance of forces continuing to shift in the mainland&apos;s favour,&quot; it said. While Taiwan was also increasing its defence spending, presidential elections due in Taipei next March could further exacerbate bilateral strains. Taiwanese officials recently denied they were planning to acquire medium-range missiles or weapons of mass destruction but internal political divisions continue over how best to deter China. China&apos;s response to the Pentagon&apos;s critique has been robust and subtle. The foreign ministry deplored &quot;brutal interference&quot; in China&apos;s internal affairs. The official People&apos;s Daily suggested the report was a blatant attempt by US hawks to disrupt US-China relations. &quot;By ignoring the facts and deliberately playing up the so-called China military threat, the report absolutely does not have a leg to stand on,&quot; the paper said. Speaking at an International Institute for Strategic Studies conference in Singapore, Lt-General Zhang Qinsheng, deputy chief of the Chinese general staff, said US fears were exaggerated. &quot;China is different from the rising powers in history as it has chosen the path of peaceful development ... China all along adheres to a defence policy that is defensive in nature. China shall never fire the first shot,&quot; he said. Gen Zhang insisted China&apos;s defence budget figures were &quot;true and authentic&quot;. Given &quot;the multiple security threats we face&quot;, he said overall expenditure was &quot;fairly small&quot; in comparison with the US. Western and Taiwanese analysts say China&apos;s emerging Taiwan strategy is to deter US military intervention in a future conflict by keeping US aircraft carrier groups at bay, far out in the western Pacific, principally through the use of missile submarines \u2014 the policy of &quot;area denial&quot;. But China also has concerns about US capabilities, they say, including Washington&apos;s overwhelming nuclear superiority \u2014 roughly 10,000 warheads to China&apos;s 400. As a global trading power with growing international interests and vulnerable Middle East oil supply routes, China&apos;s growing projection of military power, is hardly seen as exceptional. Rather, it follows an established western tradition. Mr Bush&apos;s plans for global missile defence, a source of friction with Russia, have meanwhile further complicated the east Asian military equation. Joint US-Japan cooperation on missile defence, ostensibly to deter North Korea, has left Beijing wondering, like Moscow, whether for all its emphasis on transparency, the Bush administration is telling the whole story."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/13/newsstory.sport7", "sentences": ["Thaksin has been granted 60 days to present evidence to an anti-corruption committee in Thailand to prove that his wealth - principally generated from the \u00a31bn tax-free sale to the Singapore government of his family&apos;s stake in the Thai-based Shin Corp telecoms group - has been earned legally."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-13T01:12:20Z", "title": "Football: Fresh hurdle faces Thaksin's City takeover bid", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s proposed \u00a390m takeover of Manchester City faces another obstacle after it emerged that the Premier League would implement fit-and-proper-persons regulations if he were convicted of fraud in his homeland. The bulk of the former Thai prime minister&apos;s assets have been frozen, pending possible corruption charges, and City have reluctantly started to plan for life without him. City&apos;s chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, has embarked on a two-day trip to mainland Europe to speak to managerial candidates. With Mackintosh hoping to meet the Sevilla coach, Juande Ramos, and possibly going against Thaksin&apos;s wishes by approaching Sven-Goran Eriksson, sources close to Thaksin admitted the deal was &quot;on the ropes&quot;. The billionaire was said to be determined to press ahead with his takeover but the Premier League&apos;s intervention might prevent him taking any role in the top division even if he were still in a financial position to proceed. Every board member or controlling shareholder of a Premier League club must sign a &quot;director&apos;s declaration&quot; stating whether he or she has convictions for fraud, theft, corruption or associated offences. Clubs with a director carrying such convictions are debarred from competing in the league until the association with the individual is terminated. Thaksin has been granted 60 days to present evidence to an anti-corruption committee in Thailand to prove that his wealth - principally generated from the \u00a31bn tax-free sale to the Singapore government of his family&apos;s stake in the Thai-based Shin Corp telecoms group - has been earned legally. The committee will then refer its findings to Thailand&apos;s courts of justice. If charges and a conviction were to follow, the Premier League would be forced to exercise its fit-and-proper-persons regulations for the first time. At their introduction in August 2004 the league&apos;s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, stated: &quot;The fit-and-proper-persons test puts football club directors in the Premier League under a far more rigorous test than ordinary company law.&quot; The fact that Thaksin might already have completed his purchase of City would not prevent retrospective action by the Premier League. Thaksin and his representatives spent yesterday in a series of top-level meetings to discuss the freezing of his bank balances and other financial assets, and a statement from his lawyer, Michael Goldberg, said the 57-year-old would &quot;vigorously evaluate all international options to protect his rights and interests&quot;. Thaksin was overthrown in a bloodless coup last year and is now living in London. &quot;The junta is committed to finding means to circumvent any rule of law to persecute Dr Thaksin, his family, his friends and his business activities,&quot; Goldberg continued. &quot;The junta&apos;s attacks on Dr Thaksin amount to an arbitrary interference with his privacy and his family, his private property, his business interests as well as his honour and reputation.&quot; The implications for City are enormous and the club chairman, John Wardle, convened an emergency board meeting yesterday. The club&apos;s lawyers have asked Thaksin for written confirmation that he is in a position to proceed and Manchester city council, which owns the stadium, has become involved. &quot;The perception of the club is one of drift,&quot; said the council leader, Sir Richard Leese. &quot;The board ought to put a deadline on the takeover issue.

Jubilant police claimed that Dujana, Indonesia&apos;s most-wanted Islamic militant, headed JI&apos;s military wing and his arrest had thwarted future terror attacks by the group, which last carried out an attack in 2005.   &quot;With this arrest we have successfully stopped acts of terrorism in the future,&quot; said Indonesian police spokesman, Sisno Adiwinoto. &quot;He was a key figure in the terrorist network in Indonesia.&quot;   Few details emerged of the operation that led to Dujana&apos;s capture. But information gleaned from raids in March, when a vast cache of bomb-making equipment was seized, led the police anti-terror unit, Detachment 88, to Dujana&apos;s hideout on Saturday. He was wounded in the thigh in a shootout.   JI has been blamed for a series of bomb attacks following the Bali nightclub bombings that killed 88 Australian tourists. An attack on Jakarta&apos;s Marriott Hotel in 2003 that killed 14, mainly foreigners, was followed by a blast at the Australian embassy in 2004 and another bombing in Bali in 2005.   Dujana, a fluent Arabic and English speaker who is reputed to have met Osama bin Laden, has long been a central figure in the organisation that seeks an Islamic state spanning south-east Asia.   Al-Qaida was said to have funded JI&apos;s earlier bombing missions but a gulf has grown between the organisations in recent years. Now the Indonesian group is thought more likely to target Jakarta&apos;s police and officials rather than foreign diplomats or tourists.   Dujana&apos;s links with senior al-Qaida leaders go back to the mid-90s, when he and others fled to Malaysia to escape a crackdown in Indonesia by President Suharto.   JI has been badly hit by the prosecution of 200 of its operatives - including five who were sentenced to death - since 2002. But the group also proved resilient in replacing leaders arrested or killed and still has about 900 members.   &quot;This is the most significant arrest in the last three years,&quot; said Sidney Jones, south-east Asia director of the International Crisis Group think-tank. &quot;This man knows everything there is to know about Jemaah Islamiyah. But this is not the end. It will rebuild itself.&quot;  &quot;Indonesia still faces significant threats because of the new groups that have emerged,&quot; said terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna, of Singapore&apos;s S Ragartnam School of International Studies. &quot;JI has penetrated these groups and established links. Radicalisation activities are still taking place in south-east Asia and Indonesia&apos;s no exception, so the threat of terrorism remains.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/13/simontisdall.international", "sentences": ["Speaking at an International Institute for Strategic Studies conference in Singapore, Lt-General Zhang Qinsheng, deputy chief of the Chinese general staff, said US fears were exaggerated."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-13T22:50:27Z", "title": "Simon Tisdall: Pentagon report chills  US-China relations", "tags": ["World news", "US national security"], "article": "Even as the US struggles to stop relations with Russia plunging into deep freeze, a distinct chill has descended over its dealings with Beijing following a new Pentagon report on China&apos;s military build-up. Richard Nixon knew better than to antagonise both superpower rivals at once. No such wisdom troubles George Bush. Noting China&apos;s &quot;rapid rise as a regional political and economic power with global aspirations&quot;, the Pentagon complained of uncertainty surrounding its expanding military might and how it may be used. Beijing&apos;s short-term focus was &quot;military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait&quot;, it said. But it was also planning to project military power further afield in the Asia-Pacific region, in preparation for possible conflicts over resources or territory. The Pentagon took particular exception to the Chinese navy&apos;s development of a new fleet of five Jin-class ballistic missile submarines with enhanced, long-range nuclear weapons capabilities; the successful test in January of a direct-ascent, anti-satellite weapon that &quot;put at risk the assets of all space-faring nations and posed dangers to human space flight&quot;; and China&apos;s growing ability to counter US battlefield, space and cyberspace technologies in support of so-called &quot;area denial&quot; strategies. Challenging the Communist party leadership&apos;s &quot;peaceful rise&quot; slogan, the US defence planners claimed &quot;China&apos;s actions in certain areas appear inconsistent with its declaratory policies and defence expenditures remain far above officially disclosed figures&quot;. And they highlighted two problems. While tensions with Japan had eased somewhat after last November&apos;s Beijing summit, &quot;territorial disputes in the East China Sea and China&apos;s efforts to block Japan&apos;s quest for a seat on the UN security council remain sources of friction&quot;. The report also warned that Taiwan, which Beijing deems a renegade territory but whose de facto independence is implicitly underwritten by the US, remained the most likely flashpoint. &quot;China&apos;s military modernisation and the deployment of advanced capabilities opposite the island have not eased, with the balance of forces continuing to shift in the mainland&apos;s favour,&quot; it said. While Taiwan was also increasing its defence spending, presidential elections due in Taipei next March could further exacerbate bilateral strains. Taiwanese officials recently denied they were planning to acquire medium-range missiles or weapons of mass destruction but internal political divisions continue over how best to deter China. China&apos;s response to the Pentagon&apos;s critique has been robust and subtle. The foreign ministry deplored &quot;brutal interference&quot; in China&apos;s internal affairs. The official People&apos;s Daily suggested the report was a blatant attempt by US hawks to disrupt US-China relations. &quot;By ignoring the facts and deliberately playing up the so-called China military threat, the report absolutely does not have a leg to stand on,&quot; the paper said. Speaking at an International Institute for Strategic Studies conference in Singapore, Lt-General Zhang Qinsheng, deputy chief of the Chinese general staff, said US fears were exaggerated. &quot;China is different from the rising powers in history as it has chosen the path of peaceful development ... China all along adheres to a defence policy that is defensive in nature. China shall never fire the first shot,&quot; he said. Gen Zhang insisted China&apos;s defence budget figures were &quot;true and authentic&quot;. Given &quot;the multiple security threats we face&quot;, he said overall expenditure was &quot;fairly small&quot; in comparison with the US. Western and Taiwanese analysts say China&apos;s emerging Taiwan strategy is to deter US military intervention in a future conflict by keeping US aircraft carrier groups at bay, far out in the western Pacific, principally through the use of missile submarines - the policy of &quot;area denial&quot;. But China also has concerns about US capabilities, they say, including Washington&apos;s overwhelming nuclear superiority - roughly 10,000 warheads to China&apos;s 400. As a global trading power with growing international interests and vulnerable Middle East oil supply routes, China&apos;s growing projection of military power, is hardly seen as exceptional. Rather, it follows an established western tradition. Mr Bush&apos;s plans for global missile defence, a source of friction with Russia, have meanwhile further complicated the east Asian military equation. Joint US-Japan cooperation on missile defence, ostensibly to deter North Korea, has left Beijing wondering, like Moscow, whether for all its emphasis on transparency, the Bush administration is telling the whole story."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/14/india.formulaone", "sentences": ["Valencia and Singapore will hold races for the first time in 2008, while Abu Dhabi will enter the fray in 2009 followed by South Korea a year later."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-14T14:27:48Z", "title": "Formula one: India to host formula one after Bernie Ecclestone approved deal for a 2009 grand prix", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Formula One", "Sport", "Formula one 2007", "Bernie Ecclestone"], "article": "New Delhi will host a grand prix in 2009 after the Indian Olympic Association announced a preliminary deal with with formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone.

After a three-day visit by an IOC coordination commission, including 14 Olympic medallists with the experience of 215 Games between them, its Swiss chairman, Denis Oswald, said London&apos;s preparations were perhaps the best he had seen. After nine months dominated by rows over a spiralling budget and capped by 10 days of controversy over the new logo, Oswald&apos;s five-star assessment was gratefully received by the organising committee chairman, Lord Coe, at a press conference yesterday afternoon. Sitting alongside Oswald, the double Olympic champion&apos;s smile broadened as the superlatives flowed, as well it might; had his school reports been this good he might not have needed to take up running. Even by IOC standards of diplomatic language, a code that reduces crises to &quot;challenges&quot; and fiascos to &quot;setbacks&quot;, Oswald&apos;s summary was glowing. &quot;The IOC have been very impressed with what we have seen this week. There is an excellent team in place who work together with real spirit,&quot; he said. &quot;Operationally and financially they are on track and on time. The interest from the business community is very high . . . and interest in the local community is also very high. The vision outlined in Singapore is still there. As far as legacy is concerned . . . we really consider that London will be a model for future host cities.&quot; Asked whether London&apos;s progress was the most impressive he had seen, Oswald only hesitated for fear of insulting the 2008 hosts Beijing by omission. &quot;It is very difficult to compare because every Games is different . . . but I am strongly tempted to say yes . . . I have been involved in the organisation of 18 Games and for recent Games I have to say yes.&quot; He was, if anything, even more enthusiastic about the logo, described earlier in the day by Tony Blair as either &quot;brilliant or awful&quot;. &quot;I love it,&quot; Oswald said. &quot;It&apos;s very simple. We had a presentation about two months ago before it became public. When I came back I phoned the IOC president to report and the first thing I told him is they have a fantastic logo: very young, very dynamic, with flexibility about how it can be used. It reflects what London wants to do with the Games in 2012.&quot; After the controversy of the past few months, epitomised by the damaging longeurs while the DCMS and the Treasury haggled over the \u00a39.3bn budget, the IOC&apos;s assessment was particularly welcome, not least among Locog staff said to be disheartened by negative coverage. Challenges remain for the organising committee and the Olympic Delivery Authority as they prepare to start the construction of the Olympic Park next summer, not least the transfer of power from Blair to Gordon Brown. Oswald said he was confident that the shift in power would not affect London&apos;s progress, even if the change were to end with a Conservative government. &quot;The IOC has no influence over national politics, but we are well used to change. In Athens [2004 hosts] we had elections almost every year at local, regional or national level and we had a change of government four months before the Games, so we are used to it. What is important is that people support the Games, and from what I have heard there will be full support . . . from both sides.&quot; The IOC&apos;s visit, the second of what will become twice-yearly inspections from 2008, was the first since the massively increased budget - up from \u00a32.4bn at the bidding stage to \u00a39.3bn - but Oswald professed to be untroubled."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/jun/15/shouldwecensortouringprodu", "sentences": ["But in Singapore, they go one step further: theatre has age-related censorship and an R18 rating means that nobody under that age is allowed in.", "The rules in Singapore are such that if McKellen strips off, the production must be given an R18 rating, which means that more than a thousand children who have booked for the performances will be unable to attend.", "What&apos;s happening in Singapore may seem insignificant, but in the search to broaden audiences both here and abroad, it may be that companies are allowing themselves to fall prey to censorship.", "But, as with what&apos;s happening in Singapore, it gives me a twinge of uneasiness."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T14:03:00Z", "title": "Should we censor plays for overseas audiences?", "tags": ["Stage", "King Lear"], "article": "On, on you lendings ... Ian McKellen in the RSC&apos;s King Lear Photograph: Tristram Kenton The fear of causing offence - and attracting litigation - means that the average British theatre foyer now offers more warning notices than a packet of cigarettes. In some cases, this means that while Hamlet might be a no-no for anyone under 14, Snow White is considered just fine and dandy for under-sevens - despite its tale of murder, revenge and a teenage girl living alone with seven men. Not to mention red-hot shoes that dance you to death, a punishment that even the Jacobean playwrights at their most nastily inventive couldn&apos;t come up with. These restrictions are, of course, entirely unenforceable; parents can ignore them as they wish. And so they should, although I recall once watching a mother and her twin eight-year-olds waiting outside the Gate Dublin and thinking that Medea was a slightly odd choice for a family outing. But in Singapore, they go one step further: theatre has age-related censorship and an R18 rating means that nobody under that age is allowed in. This has caused a spot of bother for the RSC, which is heading there with its version of King Lear starring Ian McKellen, who follows a recent theatrical tradition and divests himself of his undergarments during the storm scene. The rules in Singapore are such that if McKellen strips off, the production must be given an R18 rating, which means that more than a thousand children who have booked for the performances will be unable to attend. The RSC has bowed to pressure: McKellen will now keep his togs on. I feel some ambivalence about this. Anyone touring a production abroad, particularly to Asia or the Middle East, will obviously be aware of local sensibilities. To cut the offending action seems the most sensible option, and it would seem absurd to deny the children the opportunity to see the production in all its glory because of a tiny section when McKellen can be seen in all his. But if the divestment can be cut so easily, perhaps it&apos;s not really integral to the production and maybe shouldn&apos;t be there at all. More importantly - whichever way you look at - it is a form of censorship. How far should directors, companies and theatres go to avoid offending audiences or accommodate audiences&apos; particular sensibilities? Already, here in Britain, religious groups are increasingly successful in their attempts to suppress productions, whether it&apos;s pressure groups such as Christian Voice over Jerry Springer or some of Birmingham&apos;s Sikhs over Behzti. In North America, plays including My Name is Rachel Corrie have been pulled by theatres afraid that they might lose audiences - and precious subscriptions - if they go ahead with controversial productions. What&apos;s happening in Singapore may seem insignificant, but in the search to broaden audiences both here and abroad, it may be that companies are allowing themselves to fall prey to censorship. Last Christmas, BAC and Kneehigh made changes for one performance of Rapunzel in order to allow a group of Muslim schoolgirls to attend, who otherwise would not have been allowed to see it because of some of the content. When I spoke to BAC&apos;s David Jubb about this, he spoke persuasively about how making very minor changes brought a new audience into the theatre and that the gains were greater than the losses: in many ways, a sensible choice. But, as with what&apos;s happening in Singapore, it gives me a twinge of uneasiness.

If his \u00a345bn bid for Dutch rival ABN Amro is successful, he is in line to become the boss of the world&apos;s fifth-largest bank; if he loses, as some are warning he will, to a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland, he could find himself out of a job and Barclays itself vulnerable to a takeover. The 51-year-old grey-haired banker refuses to be downbeat about the RBS consortium gatecrashing his dream deal with a higher offer, laden with cash to appeal to ABN Amro shareholders. &quot;I haven&apos;t been surprised by anything that&apos;s occurred in the last three or four months [since the ABN Amro bid was announced]. If other people express an interest in it, then so be it,&quot; he says. The battle for ABN Amro has become &quot;pretty much all-consuming&quot;. &quot;You know how it is, if you have the adrenaline from doing something you believe in strongly then it keeps you going.&quot; Adrenaline is something he is likely to need in spades. The fight for control of the Dutch bank has become locked in the courts. Late in July the Dutch supreme court is expected to rule whether the ABN Amro board can sell the bank&apos;s US subsidiary, LaSalle, without a vote by ABN Amro shareholders. The LaSalle sale was a side deal pulled off by Barclays to help bolster its all-share offer and see off any rival bidders. It has backfired. Taken to the courts by ABN Amro shareholders who regarded it as a poison pill, the once so-clever deal has become a complicating factor. Until the court decision the bid seems to be at a stalemate but the uncertainty is giving Barclays shareholders the chance to get cold feet and question the price being paid. One activist investor is urging Varley to drop the bid. Red braces Without his jacket but sporting his trademark high-waisted trousers and bright red braces, Varley acknowledges the stakes are high. &quot;I think you&apos;ve got to be realistic if you embark on something like this. You&apos;ve always got to accept the possibility that somebody else will compete and you shouldn&apos;t be disconcerted by that.&quot; The Oxford-educated banker initiated talks with ABN Amro less than a year after he became chief executive in September 2004, although they did not begin in earnest until this year. His promotion to the top job, having been previously passed over at least once, followed a varied career with the bank which he joined in 1982 after a brief spell as a solicitor. An aloof intellectual who boarded at prep school before going to Catholic school Downside, Varley has close ties with the bank through his marriage to Carolyn Pease, whose Quaker family sold their bank to Barclays in the 1900s. He had one year of absence in 1994 when he went to work for Odey Asset Management, run by his sister-in-law&apos;s husband. Work at Barclays had got on top of him. &quot;I was deputy head of equities in BZW [the now defunct investment arm]. A lot of what we wanted to achieve was done. I was feeling quite worn out at the time. I&apos;ve never had that experience before or since. I find my work energising but I went through a period then when I didn&apos;t. I needed to do something different.&quot; The year&apos;s absence did his career no harm: he came back to take on a number of senior roles, including running the retail bank, and became finance director. Questions about the family connection seem to frustrate him. When asked how he met his wife, who gave him his passion for fishing, he retorts: &quot;I can&apos;t remember.&quot; Clearly he can and it is more a reflection of an inability to be rude, when what he would rather say is: &quot;It&apos;s none of your business.&quot; The family connection was raised when the bid for ABN Amro was announced and analysts accused him of being motivated by &quot;ego and politics&quot; to satisfy his in-laws. A search for his motivation for the bid is perhaps also behind rumours that he embarked on it to rein in his boardroom colleague - some say adversary - Bob Diamond by building up the retail and commercial banking parts of the Barclays empire, which are not within Diamond&apos;s large remit. Varley sighs: &quot;I hear some of those comments. They don&apos;t trouble me much. We are very clear about what we&apos;re after here. You can&apos;t move on something as significant as this if you don&apos;t have your executive committee and your board full-square behind you.&quot; Formidable pairing If the bid is successful, Varley will move his &quot;centre of gravity&quot; to Amsterdam, moving to the Dutch city but leaving his wife and two children behind to complete school. Members of his executive team will follow, as will an undisclosed number of people from the hi-tech Canary Wharf headquarters where Varley runs his empire from the 31st floor and four times a year challenges staff to a table tennis match against himself and Paul Idzik, the eccentric chief operating officer and former world-ranking tennis player. The passion for ping pong comes from his school days. Otherwise calm and collected, he can barely hide his competitive streak. &quot;Idzik and I are a formidable pairing,&quot; he says, though conceding they do not always win. It would be easy to accuse Varley of being a Barclays lifer who would be reluctant to instigate change. He acknowledges the concern. &quot;What you say to yourself is that someone who has been there a long time is a prisoner to the organisation and won&apos;t have the will to change it.&quot; In reality, he has made more changes than many had predicted, most visibly in refreshing the top management team and squeezing out one-time internal rivals for the top job. Below board level, he has brought in Deanna Oppenheimer from the US to revitalise the sluggish high street bank and he credits her with having a &quot;massive and positive effect&quot;. &quot;She is followed by people who respect her,&quot; Varley adds, and goes on to talk about the 60% of the Barclays workforce who are female. &quot;There aren&apos;t enough of them at the top,&quot; he says. He has two &quot;women&apos;s listening groups&quot; where he goes to, well, listen. Varley used to run the retail business that is now Oppenheimer&apos;s domain. He is still remembered for closing 171 branches on one day in April 2000, at the same time as the bank was changing the way it charged for cash machine withdrawals, introducing a potentially lucrative pay scheme for top executives and firing 6,000 staff. In an interview on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme he was skewered on the bonus question by an extremely combative John Humphrys. The episode is now used by public relations executives as an example of how not to do it. Varley admits the episode was a &quot;difficult experience&quot;. &quot;I accept we got it wrong and I learned a lot from that.&quot; Around this time, Barclays also bought Woolwich, which has since lost mortgage customers and is being used by critics of the ABN Amro takeover to justify their scepticism. The retail bank, like others, is being swamped by customers reclaiming overdraft fees. While it is hard to imagine Varley has ever had an overdraft, he stresses that 85% of customers who ask for a free overdraft get one. The retail bank has shrunk in importance from the days when Varley ran it. Then it generated 70% of Barclays&apos; \u00a32.4bn profits. Seven years on, it generates 20% of the \u00a37.1bn profits, after Varley set the bank on a drive to earn more than 50% of its revenue overseas. To him, the takeover of ABN Amro is a continuation of the grand international plan even though the deal has surprised many who had grown used to his mantra that acquisitions are the &quot;servant of strategy not the master&quot;. His dream deal may yet end in tears. But Varley insists he can keep a cool head. &quot;We&apos;re exhilarated by the deal but not in love with something we can&apos;t walk away from. If you fall in love with an opportunity then you are tempted to do something on the wrong terms and we are very clear about the financial tests we apply,&quot; he says. If the bid fails he insists it will be business as usual. &quot;Our strategy will be exactly the same. It&apos;s right for Barclays to look at this from a position of strength. That means if we decide not to go ahead we can walk away without feeling we are in some strategic cul-de-sac.&quot; Some believe failure could leave Barclays a sitting duck. Varley disputes this but adds: &quot;What board would command confidence from its shareholders if it was not prepared to consider acquisitions?&quot; Few are prepared to predict the outcome of the fiendishly complex battle but some warn it may turn out to be a risk too far for Varley, a man usually so cautious he sets his watch 10 minutes fast - he finds it &quot;reassuring&quot;. That 10-minute head start may be just what he needs in the weeks ahead. CV Born April 1 1956 Education Downside School; Oriel College, Oxford.

The singer, a former member of Destiny&apos;s Child, is used to people taking the odd pot-shot. But some things go beyond the pale. &quot;I&apos;ve heard everything these past few weeks,&quot; she chuckles with bemused resignation. &quot;From Beyonc\u00e9 bein&apos; engaged, to my mom and Mathew [Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9&apos;s dad and Destiny&apos;s Child&apos;s manager] having this rendezvous and making me, to me being pregnant, to me being dead ...&quot; It&apos;s bad enough when people are suggesting that you&apos;re manipulative or cold, as some did of Rowland and Beyonc\u00e9 when the group abruptly shed two members, amid legal acrimony, just as they were becoming one of the biggest brands in urban pop; and pretty difficult when rumour-mongers insist that your closeness to your manager is because he&apos;s secretly your dad, or that he&apos;s your uncle, or that he and his wife have become your legal guardians (all of which have been alleged, and none of which is true). But being pronounced dead is no laughing matter. &quot;I had been in Singapore, and was on an 18-hour flight home, so none of my family could get in contact with me,&quot; she recalls of the moment when exaggerated rumours of her demise became all the rage last November. &quot;All they know is that it&apos;s all over the radio airwaves that I&apos;m dead, that I was in a car accident in Singapore. And I was like, &apos;That&apos;s so not funny&apos;: one, to play with life like that, and two to play with my family&apos;s emotions. So, that was the worst. But people make up crazy stuff because they want something to say. And we,&quot; she says, referring to the extended Destiny&apos;s Child clan, &quot;don&apos;t have nothin&apos; to talk about.&quot; It seems one of the more bizarre demands that celebrity places on those it envelops that their lives must assume a status somewhere beyond reality. Whether Destiny&apos;s Child had presented themselves as down-home girls next door, or bionic sex kittens from outer space on a mission to conquer earth (and there were times during the group&apos;s career, which included selling 70m albums, when they appeared to be doing both simultaneously), what the audience sees is rarely enough. Conspiracy theories have always fed the popular imagination, but it seems we are no longer happy just to muse over UFOs and assassination plots: we want to believe that our pop stars have dark secrets and hidden motivations. So when Rowland sits down in a London hotel to talk about her second solo album, Ms Kelly, she knows that it won&apos;t be long before conversation turns to those moments of controversy and confusion; the bumps in what seems a remarkably smooth road from childhood ambition to global superstardom. And while her assertion that the DC set-up has &quot;nothin&apos; to talk about&quot; is a bit wide of the mark, what ensues is not a series of media-trained banalities, but a conversation that feels rather more substantial - perhaps even real. Like the singers she idolised as a child, Rowland is finding that baring your soul for a living can be a painful experience. Born in Atlanta in 1981, Kelendria Rowland moved to Houston with her mother when she was eight. At school, she met LaTavia Roberson and, through her, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles. Roberson and Knowles were members of a girl group - for which, before her teens, Rowland had auditioned successfully. Inspired by the likes of TLC and SWV, they tried out group names redolent of the fresh-faced pop-R&amp;B styles of the day - Girls Tyme; Somethin&apos; Fresh; Cliche. Settling on the name Destiny&apos;s Child, and with a line-up of Knowles, Roberson, Rowland and LeToya Luckett, they spent years rehearsing at Knowles&apos; home, putting in the hours between homework and bedtime. By 1997, with Mathew having given up a well-paid job with Xerox to manage them, the group got their big break, signing with the Columbia label. Their first single, No, No, No sold more than a million copies, turning the girls into &quot;overnight&quot; stars. The problems began after the second album, the portentously titled The Writing&apos;s on the Wall, was released in 1999. Luckett and Roberson issued a lawsuit, alleging that Mathew Knowles was taking too great a slice of the group&apos;s income and chafing at what they saw as his overbearing control. They named Mathew, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly as respondents. They may not have intended to split up the group, but that was the result. The video for Say My Name, the album&apos;s third single, featured two new members miming Roberson&apos;s and Luckett&apos;s parts, much to their - and the group&apos;s fans&apos; - surprise. The suit against Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly was eventually dropped, though conditions were placed on both sides preventing them from discussing their former bandmates in negative terms. &quot;I can&apos;t say too much,&quot; Rowland apologises. &quot;I don&apos;t know how to say it without ... sayin&apos; it!&quot; she laughs. &quot;But fingers were pointed, and, er, facts were not stated.&quot; Rowland&apos;s usually sunny demeanour darkens. Earlier in our interview she has carefully but politely referred to Roberson and Luckett not by name, but as &quot;the former members&quot; or &quot;the ladies&quot;. &quot;It was really unfair, when I think about the whole situation, just because the ladies didn&apos;t talk to me, nor Beyonc\u00e9, about how they were feelin&apos;,&quot; she says, carefully but with evident emotion. &quot;We were just served these papers. And it was the worst feeling, because you think about growing up with these ladies for your whole life, pretty much, and you lose your best fri-&quot; She chokes a little, and tears start to well up. She apologises. &quot;I remember how that hurt so bad, because we loved them.&quot; She is surprised by the strength of her feelings: clearly that love still exists. &quot;Yeah, definitely,&quot; she says, dabbing her eyes carefully with a manicured finger. &quot;And care for them, genuinely. And now, to see LaToya doin&apos; her thing with her career [Luckings released her debut solo album to considerable success last year], I&apos;m so proud of her. And I think LaTavia&apos;s a writer now, and to see her like that is just amazing. So I think you realise that life has to happen, and you have to move on. But that was painful.&quot; Perhaps surprisingly, Rowland is able to talk about the end of her relationship with Dallas Cowboys football player Roy Williams without as much evident angst. The couple were engaged, and Rowland appeared on the cover of an American bridal magazine discussing plans for their wedding. But the March 2005 ceremony was cancelled at relatively short notice. &quot;With the engagement, I feel like I wasn&apos;t ready, to be honest,&quot; she shrugs. &quot;This is the first time I&apos;ve ever said this, but I felt like I wasn&apos;t healed from my other relationships. From the relationship before him.&quot; The album that has become Ms Kelly was begun in the wake of the end of the engagement, and due for release last summer, but Rowland felt the emotions she was going through were making it a depressing listen. &quot;It was more serious,&quot; she recalls of the now largely scrapped version, &quot;all, &apos;This is what I&apos;ve been through&apos; and &apos;My heartache&apos;. But,&quot; she says, switching into an admonitory tone, &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;Kelly! Life is not just about heartache! You have good times and you should talk about those as well!&apos; So that&apos;s what I did.&quot; She describes the second album she&apos;s released under her own name as the first she feels represents her as an artist. Enlivened by uptempo tracks recorded near her Miami home after nights out clubbing with A-list hip-hop producer Scott Storch, Ms Kelly rights the wrong Rowland perceived in her first solo album, Simply Deep, and contains the &quot;missing elements - the fun, playful elements&quot; that make up her character. But the shadow cast by her relationship looms large. &quot;I think I&apos;d have made people cry with the first draft of the record,&quot; she says with a chuckle. &quot;But with this one, they&apos;ll feel everything. To me, it feels like the healing process of a break-up. The first half is, &apos;OK, I broke up, but I&apos;m just fine, and I&apos;m gonna go out here and show the world.&apos; Then you go through the sadness, and the anger, and then you let it go and know that it&apos;s OK just by yourself. I think that when bad things happen to us, you kinda dwell on it. And I never wanted - never want - to be bitter.&quot;  \u00b7 Ms Kelly is released on RCA on June 25"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jun/16/theatre3", "sentences": ["Peter Bowles and Maggie Steed star.Lyn Gardner \u00b7 Minerva Theatre, Sat 16 to Aug 4 Song Of SingaporeBolton Murder meets musical in the Octagon&apos;s final show of the season, a sultry, jazzy musical comedy set in 1941."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T23:02:17Z", "title": "Theatre preview: June 16-22", "tags": ["Theatre", "Culture", "Stage", "Stephen Sondheim", "Musicals"], "article": "The Five Wives Of Maurice PinderLondon If you watched the Channel 4 series Big Love - concerning the emotional strains and practicalities of a man having several wives - you&apos;ll have some idea of what Matt Charman&apos;s new play is all about.

However, the fact that Ranjit Bolt has done this brand new translation bodes well for this story of the ageing general, once a debonair lieutenant, who revisits lost love. Like school reunions this can be a mistake, particularly as the once handsome general has run to fat and has a hypochondriac wife and two ghastly daughters.

How is maleness expressed and is it expressed in different ways if you are a seven-year-old or 70? Those are just some of the issues being explored in Boychild, the result of a year-long collaboration between theatre-maker Mark Storor and groups of Dorset boys and men from local primary schools, young offenders institutes and working men&apos;s clubs. Taking place in the former Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment on the Isle of Portland, this is a site-specific production in which the audience is given entry at timed intervals throughout the day as they follow a young boy through the deserted corridors of an abandoned building and discover what lurks behind closed doors. Storor made one of the best site-specific shows I&apos;ve ever seen, Best Behaviour in the Polka foyer, and this should be a truly memorable experience.LG \u00b7 Southwell Business Park, Sun 17 MonsterManchester The young get a pretty tough time - we either wrap them in cotton wool or treat them as a threat.

It&apos;s that culture which is the subject of Duncan Macmillan&apos;s play, which was runner-up in the Bruntwood playwriting competition and which now gets its studio premiere as part of the first Manchester International Festival. Set in a classroom, it brings together Darryl, who has been excluded from school, and Tom, a teacher who is trying to get through to the boy although others before him have failed. When the going gets tough, will Tom give up? And if he does, will the dialogue between young and old, pupil and teacher be silenced forever?LG \u00b7 Royal Exchange Theatre Studio, Wed 20 to Jul 7 The Elgin MacbethElgin Apparently Lady Macbeth was really quite a nice woman, and her husband was the sort of chap you&apos;d invite around for tea. Just as Shakespeare&apos;s view of Richard III might not be historically accurate, so its seems that he might have given the Macbeths a bad press too. A follow up to National Theatre Of Scotland&apos;s Project Macbeth, The Elgin Macbeth returns to the case of Scotland&apos;s notorious king and tries to reassess his reputation and identity. Looking at the historical evidence and how it shapes up against Shakespeare&apos;s bloody version of the king, the project considers him in a new light and asks whether he was hero, villain or something in between.

In case you haven&apos;t encountered it, Flickr is one of the wonders of the digital world. It&apos;s essentially a global shoebox: it enables subscribers to upload their digital photographs to a server and as each image arrives, it is resized, stored and assigned a unique URL. Among other things, this means that instead of sending your photographs to friends and family as unwieldy email attachments, you can simply send them the links. It&apos;s a beautiful idea and it works a treat - which is why Flickr has triumphed over similar services like Photobox. It also operates on a colossal scale. As I write, the site informs me that 2,042 pictures have been uploaded in the last minute. A search for photos in its database that have been tagged with the word &apos;Ireland&apos; brings up 614,797 hits. A search for &apos;happiness&apos; brings up 36,740, &apos;sadness&apos; elicits 8,697 hits - and &apos;clouds&apos; trumps everything with 681,618. If you search for photos tagged with the word &apos;censorship&apos;, you come up with 4,012 results, and therein lies the story. Some time ago, Flickr was bought by Yahoo and folded into the latter&apos;s portfolio of web services. So Flickr - like Google in its day - went from being a clever combination of software and hardware put together by geeks to a division of a large public corporation. Initially, there were few overt signs of Flickr&apos;s change of status. Yahoo closed its own photo-hosting service. Then Flickr users were required to acquire a Yahoo ID to access their accounts. But, overall, things continued as before; until a few days ago, when Flickr users in Singapore, Germany, Hong Kong and Korea noted that they were unable to alter one of their account settings: the &apos;safe search&apos; option, which allows them to specify whether they want searches for images to filter out certain types of content. Under the new dispensation, Flickr users in these territories could only find images that had been flagged as &apos;safe&apos; - which meant, as one disgruntled protester put it, &apos;only flowers and landscapes for Germans&apos;. Nothing irritates internet users like censorship, whether real or apparent, and a revolt spread through the Flickr community. People began uploading images designed as protests against what they saw as the arbitrary actions of &apos;the management&apos;. One shows a face with patches over the eyes. The image is titled &apos;Censr steals your eyes&apos;. The protests caused some angst among members of the Flickr team, especially those who have not yet been conditioned into Yahoo&apos;s corporate culture. They went to great pains to distance themselves from the charge of censorship. One added: &apos;The central problem is that Germany has much more stringent age verification laws than its neighbouring countries and specifies much harsher penalties, including jail, for those with direct responsibility (in our case, it would be our colleagues in the German offices and we&apos;re not willing to make a call that has that kind of consequence for them).&apos; The Flickr firestorm is just the latest refutation of the enduring myth that the internet is uncontrollable. While technologically adept users can usually find anything they&apos;re looking for, the vast majority of the internet&apos;s 1.1 billion users are at the mercy of local laws, ordinances and customs. Flickr users in Singapore, Germany, Hong Kong and Korea are finding themselves at the sharp end of this, because Yahoo needs to conform to local laws if it is to continue to trade in those jurisdictions. The same forces explain why Google provides only a restricted search service to its Chinese users. Libertarianism is all very well when you&apos;re a hacker.

Standard, which plans to increase the number of its private bankers to 450 from 150 in three years, believes that wealthy individuals in Asia and the Middle East want different services from their counterparts in the west. They prefer to invest in domestic markets, whereas private banking in the US and Europe is often based around offshore investment. Wealthy Asians tend to hold a high proportion of their assets in cash, compared with Americans and Europeans who seek higher returns on the stock market. The London operation will target customers of Asian, Middle Eastern and African origin who are based here but retain ties with their country of origin. A recent Merrill Lynch Capgemini Wealth Report estimated that the wealth of rich people around the world will grow at an annual rate of 6 per cent to reach $44.6 trillion by 2010.

This one comes in at around \u00a32,700 a head. Mind you, there are a few freebies thrown in, not least the plane ticket. I am in the upper-class cabin of a Virgin Atlantic flight to Tokyo, and the bento box in front of me is lunch. I&apos;m seriously impressed. There is soft, yielding sesame tofu with walnut in one compartment and in another, a little heap of delicate shimeji mushrooms dressed with sprightly ponzu. There is some tender, savoury sukiyaki-style chicken, a little teriyaki beef with braised mountain vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, steamed rice scattered with black sesame seeds and a dish of tart, crisp Japanese pickles.  It is the best food I have ever eaten in the air, which used to be where ingredients went to die. Then again I am in the pointy end of the plane, along with Take That, who are off on a promotional trip. Obviously up here, with pop stars and plutocrats, rehydrated gunk is not a goer, and increasingly so. Since the mid 1990s when British Airways introduced the first lie-flat beds in first class, the luxury end of the airline business has been forced into a furious competition to modernise their facilities.  Now that almost all first- and business-class services have seats that uncurl into something approaching a horizontal surface, the battlefield has moved. Now it&apos;s about all the stuff that&apos;s available when you&apos;re not lying flat. It&apos;s about airport transfers. It&apos;s about lounges. And of course it&apos;s about dinner, potentially the trickiest arena of the lot. So what are the airlines doing? What would you find if you happened to turn left rather than right as you got on to a transatlantic flight?  For the most part you are likely to find the worryingly familiar face of a TV chef. Singapore Airlines has had Gordon Ramsay on its payroll for a number of years. Air New Zealand has the London-based Kiwi fusion chef Peter Gordon of the Providores restaurant turning out the likes of &apos;pan-seared halibut on parsley potato mash with nam phrik num dressing and char-grilled asparagus spears&apos;. British Airways meanwhile has, ooh, just about everyone else. Among those on their international culinary council are Michel Roux of the Waterside Inn and Richard Corrigan of Lindsay House, Mark Edwards from Nobu and the Michelin-starred Indian chef Vineet Bhatia. &apos;The chefs aren&apos;t just a marketing tool,&apos; says Derek Reid, a trained chef and now a food innovation executive at BA. &apos;While it is extremely important to have these people&apos;s names on the menus, it&apos;s also about product development.&apos; But in-flight food presents a lot of what the airline people call challenges, and chefs refer to quietly as &apos;a total pain in the arse&apos;. Michelin-starred chef Shaun Hill, now at the Glasshouse in Worcester, has been working with BA for nearly 15 years and knows all about those challenges. &apos;There was a quail dish I wanted to do for business class recently and I couldn&apos;t because they worked out they would need 2,000 quails a day to supply the service. There are also ingredients they don&apos;t like - pork for example, because of the religious sensitivity. Then there are ones that are never worth doing: they can afford lobster but they are so concerned about not poisoning people that it is either heated until it&apos;s dry and stringy or served fridge-cold so your teeth chatter.&apos;  So what food does he think works best? &apos;Curry,&apos; he says simply. &apos;Your taste buds are deadened in the air, plus food dehydrates easily. So highly spiced stews that won&apos;t suffer if cooked for longer than normal are the best thing.&apos; Which is where Vineet Bhatia comes in. Bhatia is the king of the high-class curry. The first Indian chef to win a Michelin star in Britain, he has been working with BA for a few years, and has a clear sense of what will work. One morning he invites me to join him at Alpha Services, near Heathrow, which handles part of the high-end catering for BA. He is to spend two days demonstrating dishes to the company&apos;s chefs. &apos;You can&apos;t use cabbage because that would stink out the very small space of the cabin,&apos; he says. &apos;And scallops and squid just go rubbery.&apos;  So he makes a soup of asparagus, punched up with ginger leaf, curry and spring onion. It is rich, pungent and moreish. He shows the chefs how to make a big-fisted marinade for hunks of paneer - Indian cheese - which will be roasted on the ground then reheated in the air and served with a mango and coconut chutney. &apos;I&apos;ll come back in a few weeks and see how they got on,&apos; Bhatia says. &apos;Often a dish simply won&apos;t work and we won&apos;t let it fly.&apos; One company is tackling the catering question in an altogether different way, by running what is possibly the most exclusive takeaway business in the world. NetJets, the private aviation company, has formed partnerships with some of the most exclusive restaurants and hotels going, who will deliver food to the plane. If you happen to be flying from London you can now request Chinese food in-flight from the Michelin-starred Hakkasan. If the flight is leaving Paris, you can get dishes from the three-Michelin-starred Arpege. And if it&apos;s Moscow, you can get serious sushi from Sumosan.  Of course this doesn&apos;t come cheap. An eighth share in a Gulfstream jet costs around \u00a33.8m. On top of that a one-way flight from London to New York costs just over \u00a320,000.  And be warned.

Cities were ranked on the cost and availability of broadband and wireless, adoption of new technology, government and education support and future potential. Seoul has an impressive 80% of households with comparatively cheap broadband connections, and digital mobile TV is also big business; two million South Koreans now watch TV on their mobiles on public transport. In Tokyo, three quarters of residents have a 100Mbps connection that costs only \u00a312 per month, while Hong Kong is leading in web TV with one third of all households signed up to the city&apos;s 70-channel service.

New York is at 8, Beijing at 9 and New Songdo City at 10. US cities scored well on wireless networks but were not as affordable as Asian cities.

He says he feels fine and somehow manages to fit in his &quot;day jobs&quot; in Britain - Bartlett professor of planning and regeneration at University College London, chairman of Blackpool&apos;s urban regeneration company, regular columnist in specialist magazines, prolific writing elsewhere, and with a rate of globetrotting that would make younger men tremble. &quot;Actually, I&apos;m sleeping very well,&quot; he volunteers in the splendid offices, near the Mall, of his beloved Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA), of which he is president and long-time activist. As the foremost geographer and planner of his generation, Hall feels compelled to write about every place he visits with a journalistic skill - a keen eye, attention to detail, bound in an immensely readable style - that eludes most academics. The fruits of his labours, closer to home, will be unveiled shortly in a new book, London Voices, London Lives - Tales from a Working Capital, to be published soon. Hall, who has written well over 30 books - including the masterly Cities in Civilisation (1998) - has charted the &quot;extraordinary changes&quot; in the capital over the last 50 years. The book&apos;s genesis lies in a project, undertaken with a team, that included 130 interviews for an Economic and Social Research Council-funded project. &quot;They were fascinating when transcribed,&quot; he says, &quot;but we only used a fraction of the material and, at the end of it, we said to ourselves: &apos;This is fascinating stuff. Shouldn&apos;t we make another book out of it?&apos;&quot; Fascinating because of ordinary lives? &quot;So ordinary, yes. It brings out the differences between one part of London and the other. We started out in Reading, because we thought this was a typical Thames Valley boom town. Then we jump over to Hounslow, which we call airport city, and is also a big area of Indian sub-continent settlement, mainly Gujurati from the 60s and 70s. Now many of them are saying: &apos;Oh, we don&apos;t like it here (now) because of the immigrants. We need to go to Surrey.&apos;&quot; But it is Gants Hill, near Essex, that Hall finds &quot;absolutely fascinating&quot;, as 1930s suburbia, which was very largely Jewish. &quot;They came out from Whitechapel and now they are being replaced by people from the Indian sub-continent who have come from Whitechapel.&quot; Born in Hampstead, north London, Hall went to live in Blackpool in 1940 when his father, a clerical officer in the pensions service, was dispersed to the seaside resort. Consequently, he is proud to call himself &quot;an honorary Blackpudlian&quot; and is deeply grateful for &quot;an extraordinarily good education&quot; in the town&apos;s grammar school. He is now repaying his debt to the town as chairman of its urban regeneration company. Part of his crusade to reinvent the resort involved a campaign to bring a super casino to the seafront in an attempt to kickstart wider regeneration. But earlier this year, to the surprise of almost everyone, an independent planning panel said the super-casino should go to Manchester. Uproar ensued. Hall says the latest intelligence indicates that the government will &quot;park&quot; the plan, and instead allow 16 smaller casinos to go ahead. Interviewing Hall is rather like attending a tutorial: endlessly informative, and amusing. His planning/ academic career took off with the publication of his book, London 2000, in 1963 while at Reading University as a young Fabian. &quot;It was really about planning London at a time when planning was at the top of the public agenda in a way I think it has never been since.&quot; He was invited by the government to join the South East Economic Planning Council. It was abolished in 1979 by Margaret Thatcher. &quot;I wrote afterwards that the greatest irony was she shut it down because she thought it was not making any contribution, and we had three big agendas in our last years: one, that you would never develop London Docklands without an urban development corporation; two, that London&apos;s third airport should be at Stansted; and three, that the first national transport priority should be the M25 orbital motorway. So she shut us down rapidly to implement all three!&quot; As the TCPA celebrates the 60th anniversary of the Town and Country Planning Act, Hall is no starry-eyed sentimentalist longing for a return to the interventionist politics of post-war Britain. He says: &quot;The act really assumed that the private sector wouldn&apos;t be very important any more, that most of the houses would be built by the public sector for the workers - a bit like a liberal communist country.&quot; Now the world has changed and Hall&apos;s view is that it should be possible for planners to determine where development takes place, with the private sector delivering housing and new settlements. &quot;We do know this is possible because we&apos;ve been doing it very successfully in new towns such as Milton Keynes, where you had a very strong, positive planning thrust.&quot; One of his regrets is that planning became such a pejorative term during the Thatcher governments that the discipline was ground down over 20 years to the extent that there is now a shortage of professionals. &quot;Training plummeted and the profession became beleaguered, overloaded and overworked,&quot; he says. His other regret is that the volume house builders have morphed into land speculation companies, holding back valuable, desperately-needed building land to boost balance sheets. His answer? &quot;You have to have strictly [time] limited planning consents and take it [land] off them and give it to someone else to develop. I really do.&quot; Curriculum vitae Age 75.

Undeterred, a Thai government scientist has made it his life&apos;s work to breed a virtually odourless variety. His goal is to find devotees for the south-east Asian fruit among those presently repelled by its smell. After 20 years of cross-breeding more than 90 varieties and conducting endless DNA tests at a horticultural institute near the Cambodian border, Songpol Somsri has come up with a durian strain that smells as inoffensive as a banana. Not before time. One travel writer was moved to venture that the durian - in season from April to June - smelled like &quot;pigshit, turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock&quot;. The yellow-green spiky fruit with an image problem is banned from Singapore&apos;s underground trains and many south-east Asian hotels and airlines. For durian lovers, however, the strong smell is considered a measure of its quality and is much discussed during the communal eating experience. But Mr Songpol thinks his new variety, named Chantaburi No 1 after his home province, could win favour in Europe and the US. He is cultivating seedlings and believes Thailand - the world&apos;s largest exporter - could produce up to 1m odourless durians over the next five years. &quot;I&apos;ve got friends from Australia, Europe and Japan who just won&apos;t eat durian because they can&apos;t stand the smell,&quot; said Mr Songpol. &quot;But I&apos;m sure producing those with a mild smell will help us find new markets.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jun/22/football.andrewculf", "sentences": ["The business that became Shin Corp turned into an empire that was sold to the Singapore state investment arm, Temasek, for a staggering \u00a3950m last year."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-21T23:40:49Z", "title": "Thai corruption charge overshadows tycoon's Premiership club hopes", "tags": ["UK news", "Football"], "article": "Thailand&apos;s billionaire former prime minister was charged with corruption yesterday - hours before he launched a formal bid to become the latest high-profile overseas owner of a Premiership football club. Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in his homeland nine months ago, tabled an \u00a386.1m offer to buy Manchester City, with the aim of reviving the glory days of one of England&apos;s best supported clubs. The present City board is recommending its shareholders accept the offer, but supporters, although anxious to secure Mr Thaksin&apos;s millions to spend in the transfer market, expressed concerns about his colourful background. After months of accusations by Thailand&apos;s ruling junta, prosecutors yesterday formally accused the 57-year-old of illegally helping his wife to buy a prime piece of land in Bangkok at a bargain price from the Bank of Thailand after other bidders withdrew from the auction. Mr Thaksin has been living in exile, mainly in London, since he was deposed in the bloodless coup while he was out of the country in September amid a flurry of corruption allegations that split the country between those who loved him and those who loathed him. If the Manchester City deal is approved and Mr Thaksin passes the Premiership&apos;s &quot;fit and proper person&quot; test, the club will become the eighth in the league under foreign ownership. There is speculation that even more clubs could become targets of overseas interest as the trend started by the \u00a3140m sale of Chelsea to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in 2003 intensifies. Investors are increasingly lured by a heady mix of the prestige and glamour of the league coupled with the unprecedented \u00a32.7bn global TV rights, which means that next season&apos;s champions will win \u00a350m and the bottom club \u00a326.8m even before selling tickets and merchandise. Manchester City&apos;s board, headed by chairman John Wardle, accepted financial assurances from Mr Thaksin yesterday, claiming the offer would &quot;deliver the on-field success we have been striving for&quot;. Mr Thaksin&apos;s favoured choice to become City&apos;s manager is former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, who could have \u00a350m to spend on new players to elevate the fortunes of a club that last won silverware in 1976. It finished 14th in last season&apos;s Premiership, while arch rivals Manchester United claimed another title. City, currently \u00a360m in debt, have pledged 55.9% of the shares - those owned by members of the board and former chairman Francis Lee - to Mr Thaksin. If he were also to obtain the 9.9% owned by the only other major shareholder, Sky, he would have 65.8% - close to the 75% threshold where he could take the company off the stock market. Mr Thaksin plans to become chairman with his son and daughter joining the board,. But before he can sit in the directors&apos; box at Manchester City&apos;s Eastlands stadium, attention will switch back to Bangkok. A nine-judge panel of Thailand&apos;s supreme court has until July 10 to decide whether to press ahead with charges that he allegedly flouted a bar on politicians being involved in the sale of state assets. Over the past week a committee set up by the military-appointed government to investigate corruption allegations against Mr Thaksin has frozen about \u00a3900m of assets raised from the sale of his telecoms empire. Earlier this week the Thai justice ministry ordered him to return by June 29 to face charges of concealing his assets. The prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, gave assurances that Mr Thaksin would be safe, but the army chief, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, warned he could be the target for assassins. The coup leaders were under mounting pressure to come up with hard evidence against Mr Thaksin because the corruption allegations were among the prime justifications for his overthrow nine months ago. The charges relate to a 772m baht (\u00a311.3m) 2003 land deal by the former prime minister&apos;s wife, Pojaman, during his first term. Mr Thaksin, who faces 10 years in jail and a 60,000 baht fine, denies the charges. His lawyer and unofficial spokesman in Thailand, Noppodol Pattama, said Mr Thaksin was considering whether to return. A further 12 corruption allegations against Mr Thaksin are under investigation. Mr Noppodol said that Mr Thaksin still had enough money outside the country to finance the purchase of Manchester City, but according to records of his assets filed while the prime minister, only about \u00a3200m remains unfrozen. The roller-coaster ride in Mr Thaksin&apos;s fortunes will be a new experience for the Thai of Chinese descent. A former policeman, he won a scholarship to study criminal justice in the US, returning to Thailand to set up in business. During the 80s he built up a telecommunications business that was boosted by cornering state monopolies. The business that became Shin Corp turned into an empire that was sold to the Singapore state investment arm, Temasek, for a staggering \u00a3950m last year. But along the way Mr Thaksin&apos;s ambitions outgrew commerce and in 1998 he founded the Thai Rak Thai party that from a standing start swept to power in 2001. It governed for an unprecedented full four-year term and was re-elected. In the impoverished Thai countryside, Mr Thaksin&apos;s debt relief schemes and cheap medical care won him legions of friends who have yet to desert him. But the metropolitan elite viewed his concentration of power with outrage and used the tax-free sale of Shin Corp as a catalyst for street protests that proved his eventual undoing. In Manchester yesterday Alan Galley, chairman of the City supporters&apos; club, said the deal could represent the &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot;. But he added there was still a &quot;big question mark&quot; over what would happen if Mr Thaksin was found guilty in Thailand. The former prime minister, however, pledged his &quot;utmost commitment&quot; to the club&apos;s future success and expressing a &quot;determination to take the club back to its rightful place at the highest level of competition in both the FA Premier League and European football&quot;.

Under a tree in Jamaica, far from the tourist trail, I read Thomas Flanagan&apos;s epic novel of 1798 Ireland, The Year of the French, while keeping an eye on the spider above my head, which had a body the size of a soup-plate. Still on an Irish theme, but with a change of beast: on my first morning in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, I finished Cecil Woodham-Smith&apos;s The Great Hunger, while a vast cockroach strolled around the room. Only when the famine was over did I go for the bug spray. In 1980, on a steam train stopped somewhere between Victoria Falls and Bulawayo, I pulled out of my bag Ian McEwan&apos;s The Cement Garden. What a sinister little effort, I thought. I wonder if I could write a sinister book? I wrote one or two. And quite separately, in my novel A Change of Climate, I wrote about a steam train stopped on a line in southern Africa, the heat building. Many years later, I was walking down a street in Adelaide, and a man stopped and asked if I was me. In a burst of honesty I admitted it. He said that he had taken A Change of Climate on a journey through Africa. He barely knew where it was set or anything about it, but took it out, bored, when his train happened to stop. He opened it at random and read. The paragraph he read described a stopped train. He realised, as his own train pulled into the next station, that he and the characters on the page, though lost in the vastness of the continent, were drawing simultaneously into the same dusty halt. This moving synchronicity (or perhaps just meaningless coincidence) persuades me that there may be something in the idea of holiday reading after all. Ian McEwan At the age of 18 I hitch-hiked to Greece with a schoolfriend. We found ourselves a job in a cheap hotel in Athens and lived under a tarpaulin on the roof. In our hours off, in the disabling afternoon heat, I lay on a bed and read Saul Bellow&apos;s Herzog. The dense, digressive prose, the meandering vagueness and vast intellectual reach of Moses Herzog bewitched me. I began writing letters in my head and dispatching them to world historical figures. After a week or two it became clear that the hotel owner was not going to pay us, so we presented ourselves at the British embassy to complain. While we sat in an anteroom waiting for the Third Secretary to see us, I had my Herzog with me. Like him, I could float above my circumstances; like him, I believed myself to have infinite inner resources. The Third Secretary heard us out, picked up the phone and for five minutes yelled in Greek at our employer. I was impressed, but impatient to get back to my book. At the hotel we were treated with greater respect - but still not paid. We walked out, and financed the rest of our travels by selling double doses of our blood. Weak and a little dizzy from lowered blood pressure, I sat in the medical waiting room and read Bellow&apos;s final pages, at one with Moses becalmed on his Recamier couch. He wanted to call out to his cleaning lady to tell her she was raising too much dust - but not yet: &quot;At this time he had no messages for anyone. Nothing. Not a single word.&quot; So this magnificent novel ends; my first encounter with contemporary greatness. Nothing in my rather arduous journey could touch me now. David Mitchell My first long-haul flight took the clueless 19-year-old that I was to New Delhi. It was 1988, and backpacks were still rucksacks. Squashed at the bottom of mine, under an iodine-filter water purifier, Hindi phrasebook and boxes of Band-Aids and Lemsip, was a Penguin Classic of Le Grand Meaulnes. Alain-Fournier&apos;s book stayed squashed there for a few weeks, while the subcontinent redefined my previous understanding of words such as &quot;sublime&quot;, &quot;squalor&quot;, &quot;liquid&quot; and &quot;bowels&quot;. The novel saw the light of day when I boarded a bone-shaker bus at Srinigar, bound for the city of Leh in Ladakh. Readers of Le Grand Meaulnes will know that the novel has no connection whatsoever with India, or indeed anywhere beyond its misty, muddy, pre-war French countryside. My memories of the two-day bus ride, however, and my first reading of Alain-Fournier&apos;s beautiful narrative are knitted together unpickably. The novel is not long, but rich and dense and not to be hurried. The story of Augustin Meaulnes, his unassuming friend Fran\u00e7ois Seurel and Meaulnes&apos;s romantic adventure between childhood and adulthood was dyed by the scenery passing by. The bus climbed a zig-zagging track up an escarpment, and Kashmir&apos;s muggy fertility gave way to a landscape like the moon&apos;s, but with glassy rivers. By mid-afternoon, Meaulnes had stumbled across a mysterious ch\u00e2teau where children and youths enacted a sort of masquerade. Vultures rode on Himalayan thermals, road-workers squatted by an oil-drum of bubbling tar, the skeleton of a bus lay rusting down its precipice, and a young woman showed Augustin Meaulnes the way into a new chamber of his young man&apos;s heart. Night fell without warning, and the bus disgorged us outside a hotel with no name, reception or furniture. My memory is fond of insisting that I never saw a sky so drenched with stars, either before or since. On the following morning, the landscape became arid, biblical and, to my travel-weary eyes, tedious. Le Grand Meaulnes ended in bittersweet perfection, and the bus stopped on the edge of Leh. A car had overtaken us, stopped, and now blocked the narrow road. Too naive to worry about armed robbers or a hostage situation, I took in a prayer-wheel, a prominent barracks for the Indian army, white-washed houses, TV aerials and a Buddhist stupa with fluttering prayer-flags. Our bus driver got out to remonstrate with the driver of the car, only to be greeted by a punch to his head. Down he went. Jan Morris Two books are improbably linked in my consciousness because I associate them both with particular journeys. One is Charles Doughty&apos;s classic Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888), the other is Inside USA (1947) by the incomparable American reporter John Gunther. I am prepared to swear that they have never been mentioned in the same paragraph before, but in my mind&apos;s bookshelf they stand permanently side by side. I bought my copy of Doughty at Steimatzky&apos;s in Jerusalem in 1947, during a protracted meander through the Arab countries, and it has profoundly affected me ever since. I was new to those parts then, and whenever I think of the experience now I hear the intoxicatingly antique cadences of Doughty&apos;s prose, and I remember the moment when, waking one morning in my tent on the edge of the Negev desert, I saw that during the night a company of Bedu had pitched their black tents, and hobbled their camels, miraculously in the distant sands. &quot;Ay, Wellah,&quot; Doughty murmurs to me then, &quot;the sooth indeed!&quot; On the other hand, Gunther&apos;s book (which I bought in Chicago in 1953, and which still smells suggestively of old American printer&apos;s ink) speaks to me from the corner of its mouth, as it were, and tells me of crooked mayors, presidents, oil-fields, dams, gangsters and railway tycoons. I used it constantly when I had a year&apos;s travelling fellowship in America, and went everywhere that Gunther went. &quot;Who runs this town?&quot; I can still hear him demanding. &quot;Boss (&apos;Ed&apos;) Crump, that&apos;s who, of the EH Crump Buggy &amp; Harness Company!&quot; Although the Bedu, I fear, no longer pitch their tents in that corner of Arabia Deserta, and hardly anybody remembers that WC Handy&apos;s &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; was originally called &quot;Boss Crump Blues&quot;. Although the worlds they described have long gone, I have only to open those dear old volumes to feel myself on the road once more, labouring down the trail of the Haj, or pressing on to Tennessee. DBC Pierre Childhood is where the most intense experiences of holidays and books seem to gather. A book was always a sacred piece of luggage for me on holiday, though being a strange little sod I often didn&apos;t read it. This was because, in bookshops, I was mostly taken with the smell of the ink, the weight of the pages, the cover art, and the resonance of the title. It never occurred to me to wonder what the narrative was about, or if I&apos;d even be able to read it - I was into the book as an end in itself; a shining, odorous promise of unexpected imaginings. This explained the unread Cantonese and Samoan works on my bookshelves; it explained me schlepping a green-covered hardback of Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Decline and Fall around one summer before I could even spell properly. One time though, by accident, I struck it lucky with a holiday book - the smell and title and artwork for Ray Bradbury&apos;s Something Wicked This Way Comes miraculously coincided with my reading skills, and a half-term holiday with best mates from school. We went camping to an arid chaparral in central Mexico, where the sinister twist of the bushes and the sharp edge of breeze in thin air brought the work to life. As twilight gripped the high plain, every word in the book became an immediate and ominous truth. I can&apos;t tell you now precisely what the storyline was - this was a narrative that seemed only to boost and fulfil the menace in its title. But I felt its threat approaching, my heart raced with it, night after night on that holiday and I carry the feeling of the place and its razor-edged breeze today. Jonathan Raban In 1977, licking my critical wounds after a play of mine had gone on, and swiftly come off, at the Bristol Old Vic, I fled to Aleppo with a magazine commission in hand, along with a penitential copy of Middlemarch, a book I hadn&apos;t reread since I slogged through it for A-level, figuring that three weeks alone in a Baathist police state were likely to provide ample leisure to come to terms with this most forbidding of great Victorian novels. Holed up in the venerably tacky Baron hotel with George Eliot for company, I made the transfixing discovery that she is not just the most serious, most intelligent, most grown-up, et cetera, writer of her age - she&apos;s funny. I became wedded to the book, reaching for it at the unearthly hour when taped muezzins were broadcast at full blast from the minarets of half a dozen competing mosques and the dawn orchestra of novelty car horns burped out the tune of &quot;Hitler has only got one ball . . .&quot;; I read it in caf\u00e9s, sucking down cool gusts of Latakia tobacco smoke from a hubble-bubble, and in the bugged hotel dining room over meals of leathery meat that might have been horse or goat; I carried it with me on walks, when I was followed at 20 paces by my very own, extremely dim, not-so-secret policeman. I was lucky he didn&apos;t confiscate the book as a concealed radio device, since when I communed with it I often muttered sentences from it aloud. &quot;Even Milton, looking for his portrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.&quot; When Dorothea is moved to tears of love and gratitude by Casaubon&apos;s preposterous letter of proposal, there is, besides much else, dark laughter in the writing of the scene - laughter that permeates this wrenching comedy of misperception, misunderstanding, misjudgment. And the dialogue sings: the buffoonish solemnities of Casaubon and the ineffectual witterings of Mr Brooke are conjured by Eliot with a kind of mordant hilarity. I&apos;m rereading the book now, with almost unalloyed pleasure (yes, it&apos;s too long), and each time I open its pages, it seems to release a whiff of the red dust from the tunnels of the underground soukh, and the smell of glue and wood-shavings in the lute-maker&apos;s shop - happy memories, not of Aleppo so much as of the bewitchment I felt when I first fell under Middlemarch&apos;s spell. Ian Rankin A few years back, my wife and I headed off on a rare holiday without our two sons. My brother-in-law was a diplomat stationed in Nairobi, and we were going to stay with his family for a few days, then embark on a couple of five-day safaris. My wife and elder son had done the same thing the previous year, so I was forewarned: out in the bush, facilities are limited. We would be packing insect-repellent, torches and plenty of batteries. With the prospect of a publess, tellyless two weeks, I started looking for a big fat book to take along. I had the notion of rereading Bleak House, but couldn&apos;t find it amid the clutter in my study and was determined not to buy a duplicate copy. Instead, I decided it was time to tackle Tolstoy&apos;s War and Peace. The first couple of hundred pages certainly filled the Heathrow-Nairobi flight, but while I enjoyed it, I wasn&apos;t so sure about that &quot;greatest ever novel&quot; tag. Tolstoy is good on the upper classes, great at set-pieces, but I found few characters from the lower orders in the story - something separating him straight away from Dickens. Mind you, Dickens wasn&apos;t a Count. War and Peace really came into its own, however, as we lay down to sweat the night away at sundown. My wife had bought me the sort of torch cyclists sometimes use. It could be attached around the head by a strap. This made it the perfect reading companion. Miranda would get me to read bits aloud, especially the lengthy, realistic descriptions of deep Russian winters and the frostbite suffered by the Napoleonic soldiers. The various tents and lodges we slept in didn&apos;t run to air conditioning, but here was a worthwhile alternative. By day we had plenty of adventures and misadventures (the near-submersion of our vehicle in a flood being the least of them), and one evening were left to dine alone at a candlelit dinner-table, interrupted only by the roar of a lion in the near-distance. We retreated to our lodge and I strapped my reading-light on again, ready with the next chapter. By the end of the fortnight I&apos;d finished the book. Probably not many people associate War and Peace with the heart of sweltering Africa, but I do. Elif Shafak In winter 2007, I suffered from a long and draining depression that ensnared me amid the perplexing whirl of Istanbul. For the first time in my adult life, I stopped writing and began to lose faith in words. When April came, still orbiting around the black sun of melancholy and unable to welcome the joy of spring, I decided to leave my beloved city for a few days and spend some time in Amsterdam. Istanbul was crowded, chaotic and demanding, whereas Amsterdam was small, orderly and giving. With its tranquil, tolerant culture and easygoing lifestyle, Holland seemed like El Dorado - a blissful land of milk and cheese. Purely by coincidence, if there is such a thing, I took Harry Mulisch&apos;s The Discovery of Heaven to Amsterdam with me. I enjoyed the book very much, but when I had finished reading it there remained a rather morose feeling - a feeling of apprehension and loneliness, and a sullen recognition that not even the most sterile places on earth were immune to conflicts and clashes. Helen Simpson A few years ago, I booked us a last-minute summer holiday to Ischia, and by some lucky chance packed a copy of Reflections on Blue Water by Alan Ross. We alternated ferry trips to Capri, Pompeii, Naples and Procida with days round the pool, which was fed from the hot springs for which the island is famous. Many of Ischia&apos;s visitors come for the hot mud treatments and thermal springs - Ross describes &quot;the fanghi, the foul-smelling mud pools in which there are always a handful of stout customers of both sexes wallowing&quot;. Our pool was fringed with elderly Teutonic arthritis-sufferers, up to their necks in warm water, staying put for hours. Sometimes these heads talked to each other, but more often they remained silent and glared at the children splashing around in the middle. I was glad to have a good book. In my ignorance I hadn&apos;t heard of Alan Ross, the poet, travel and cricket writer who edited the London Magazine for 40 years. Ross first visited Ischia, war-weary, in 1947; he returned often with family and friends during the 50s and 60s; then he stopped. Towards the end of his life he felt curious to see the Aeolian islands again and this book is the result of his return visit. It is a fund of associative literary information that could only have been amassed by a passionate reader. Gorky, Ibsen, Rilke, DH Lawrence, Walter Benjamin, Pablo Neruda and scores more wrote in or near Ischia; Ross describes their books and their lives with detailed succinctness, en route dipping in and out of his own thoughts and travel observations. Reflections on Blue Water was published in 1999; Alan Ross died early in 2001 (although I didn&apos;t know this). How strange that his farewell to Ischia should be my introduction, and that on holiday six months after his death I should have had such a powerful sense of being in the company of this wonderfully well-read, thoughtful man. Paul Theroux In the monsoon season of 1970, I boarded the MV Keningau in Singapore bound for Borneo. The ship was small, not much bigger than a ferry, the inexpensive way for rubber-tappers and their families to travel to the plantations of East Malaysia. They were down below - hundreds of them, off to work. I was sailing to Kota Kinabalu, for the fun of it, and also to climb Mount Kinabalu. In a few months, my wife would be giving birth to our second child, and this was a selfish and solitary jaunt, before I became fully engaged as a father of two. I also had the notion that this solitude would help me in my writing project at the time, a novel with the provisional title Saint Jack, about a middle-aged American who dreams of getting rich in Singapore. In my small bag with a change of clothes were my notebooks and my book for the trip, a hard-cover copy of VS Naipaul&apos;s novel A House for Mr Biswas. Because there were so few of us in first class, we all ate together: the captain&apos;s wife and his son; a planter&apos;s wife, part-Malay, and her small son, in the cabin next to mine; and a Tamil lawyer, travelling on his own - he was about my age, which was 29. What seems like a cast for a Maugham story was in fact a pleasant and sedate group. The captain and his family were friendly people but all of them chewed food with their mouths open, a family trait I have never encountered anywhere else. Some evenings, I played cards with the Tamil and the planter&apos;s wife, usually the game of Hearts. Then I became engrossed in the Naipaul novel, slipped into the life of the Tulsi family and its odd-man-out, Mohun Biswas. The novel is without mannerisms, seems almost not to have a style, yet is so detailed and humane, it offered me a whole world; and as with the greatest novels, it made me care. I memorised a paragraph beginning &quot;The mind is merciful . . .&quot; &quot;Paul&apos;s laughing,&quot; the planter&apos;s wife said from the card table. &quot;At a book!&quot; the Tamil said. I hardly noticed the voyage. Most of the time, I was in Trinidad with Mohun Biswas and Anand. I was dismayed that in a day or so I&apos;d be finished with the book, and I thought - as young writers do - I could never write this. But the passion of this novel helped me see that I had my own novel to write. Colin Thubron Thirty years ago I was travelling across north-east Iran in a battered Austin, reading Hermann Hesse&apos;s futuristic The Glass Bead Game. This was the consummating work of the mystical nobel laureate: a feat of transcendent genius or of earnest kitsch, depending on your taste. It was also a cult novel for hippies, and by chance I was following the old hippie trail. As I crossed the Afghan border and made for the Hindu Kush, I reached the point in the novel where its hero&apos;s spiritual journey moved beyond an immersion in mathematics towards a retreat into wild nature. At last I climbed into the remote Bamiyan valley. Above me, from my half-abandoned hotel (the hippies were dwindling), the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan - later to be dynamited by the Taliban - were still mountainously intact, and stared across to where the city ruined by Genghis Khan lay desolate under the stars. Either the altitude or the other-worldly landscape began playing on my imagination. Next day, as I drove along a track to the lakes of Band-i-Amir, I might have been Hesse&apos;s pilgrim, advancing into oblivion. The lakes were canyons sunk in the mountain plateau, treeless and lunar, like abstract sculpture carved in desert rock. The river that fed them fell in a half-calcified waterfall to the valley, where wild horses grazed. For hours I wandered round their rim. They were glassily still. Their colours were all different, brilliant and intense: one a vivid cobalt blue, another malachite green. The end of Hesse&apos;s hero comes as he swims into a blue-green lake that closes over him. I was reminded so powerfully of this as I walked that it took on a dazed foreboding. To swim into the waters of the Band-i-Amir, I felt, would be like entering a jewel, to be embalmed there: an insect trapped in amber. You would become immortal. But the cliffs beneath me were sheer; the waters looked literally untouchable. Besides, I was more in love with life than with Hesse. I retreated from their edge, and soon afterwards, back in Kabul, somebody stole my copy of The Glass Bead Game Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn It was the spring of 1985 and I had lost my job and was wandering for no good reason in South America. In my bag I had novels by some of the local geniuses, which I read in cheap pensions and dimly lit waiting rooms and buses and trains. On the train from Puno to Cuzco in Peru, which is at the oxygen-scarce top of the Andes, I began to read Mario Vargas Llosa&apos;s Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter. I had no idea it was going to be so funny. I loved the hero who marries his glamorous aunt and I could not stop laughing at his antics in the radio station. The book got funnier as the oxygen became scarcer. The more I turned the pages the more I laughed, not understanding that on this journey it was essential to save your breath. Gradually, I began to lose consciousness. It was delicious for me but most alarming for those around me. Eventually, they had to send to the guardroom for oxygen, supplies of which were kept for gringos, and applied with dexterity and haste to my poor lungs. I was warned not to pick up the book again until we had reached our destination. The Andes and Mario Vargas Llosa had left me breathless. I have never looked back. 20 recent recommendations Fiction Half a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie The Yacoubian Building by Alaa Al Aswany Falling Man by Don DeLillo The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai What Is the What by Dave Eggers Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris The Road by Cormac McCarthy On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan The Damned Utd by David Peace Absurdistan by Gary Shteyngart Non-fiction Tocqueville by Hugh Brogan Heroes by Gordon Brown Imperial Life in the Emerald City by Rajiv Chandrasekaran The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh by Linda Colley The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery The Mistress&apos;s Daughter by AM Homes Austerity Britain by David Kynaston Family Romance by John Lanchester The Hungry Years by William Leith Homo Britannicus by Chris Stringer \u00b7  To order any of these books with a discount and free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875. \u00b7 This article was amended on Wednesday June 27 2007.

Sovereign wealth funds - set up by governments to invest excess foreign exchange reserves - promise to supply the next big wave of controversy as they mushroom in size and become more aggressive in their quest for higher returns. The funds have been around for years; the Economist magazine suggests the concept may have begun when the British administration of the Gilbert Islands in Micronesia in the 1950s used money raised from the sale of bird poo - which was used in fertiliser - to set up a fund that is now worth more than $500m. Sovereign funds, swelled in many cases by petrodollars, embody the increased muscle of emerging economies on global markets. Governments traditionally held assets in reserve to protect themselves from a currency crisis; these were gold, bonds or deposits, all low-risk and easy to liquidate. With more than enough set aside for a rainy day, sovereign funds are now planting their flags in overseas share and property markets, and not everyone is happy. Apart from Norway&apos;s fund, set up with its North Sea oil money, these investment vehicles are opaque, giving little or no information on their returns or strategy. The Bush administration in the US has just issued a warning that their lack of transparency is a threat to the stability of world financial markets, saying it wants the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to intervene. The nascent US debate has been stirred further by the Chinese purchase of a $3bn stake in private equity group Blackstone - a communist state embracing the uber-capitalism of the leveraged buyout. Perhaps the mutual love of secrecy explains the attraction. There is an undercurrent of protectionism behind America&apos;s ostensible worries about financial stability; the US has already blocked a bid by China for oil company Unocal and prevented Dubai from taking over P&amp;O&apos;s US ports.But there are concerns. Sovereign funds already control around $2,500bn of assets, according to Morgan Stanley - more than the $2,000bn global hedge fund industry - and are growing by an estimated $450bn a year. This wall of money will be chasing a finite pool of assets and raises all sorts of questions. What happens when countries which do not believe wholeheartedly in capitalism or democracy become major stakeholders in large companies? Will the funds be used to prop up undemocratic regimes? Will it provoke a backlash against globalisation? Where should the lines be drawn on foreign governments acquiring stakes in strategic industries? Britain will be on the front line. Temasek, the Singapore fund, is the biggest shareholder in London-based bank Standard Chartered; Dubai took over P&amp;O and the Qataris have a chunk of supermarket group Sainsbury. Again, this is not new - in 1987 there was a furore when the Kuwait Investment Office snapped up 20 per cent of BP in its disastrous privatisation after the stock market crash - but the sovereign buying will gather pace. The Chinese, for example, know that the US is resistant and will be searching for UK assets to add to their shopping list; Middle Eastern funds will probably take a similar view. Britain should not turn protectionist, but it is time to start putting pressure on these countries to open up their own markets. The UK&apos;s position in all of this might have been rather different if we had emulated the Norwegians and set up a fund with our North Sea oil revenues. In the 1970s, my colleague William Keegan suggested just that in this newspaper - instead, the money was spent."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/24/theobserver.observerbusiness5", "sentences": ["UK corporate scalps \u00b7  Corus, formerly British Steel, sold to Tata of India in 2007 for \u00a36.7bn, after it beat off rival bidder CSN of Brazil \u00b7  Hanson, the building materials group, bought by Heidelberg Cement of Germany in 2007 for \u00a38bn \u00b7  Scottish Power, sold to Iberdrola of Spain in 2006 for \u00a311.6bn \u00b7  P&amp;O, bought by Dubai Ports World for \u00a33.9bn in 2006, defeating rival bidder Temasek of Singapore \u00b7  BOC, industrial gases group, sold to Linde of Germany in 2006 for \u00a38.2bn \u00b7  02, the mobile phone operator, went to Telefonica of Spain in 2005 for \u00a317.7bn \u00b7  Manchester United, bought by the US&apos;s Glazer family, backed by JP Morgan bank, in 2005 for \u00a3800m \u00b7  PowerGen, electricity group, sold to Eon of Germany for \u00a35bn in 2002 \u00b7  Blue Circle Industries, the cement maker, was taken over by Lafarge of France in 2001 for \u00a33bn \u00b7  Thames Water was sold first to RWE of Germany in 2000 for \u00a34.3bn, then to Macquarie of Australia in 2007, for \u00a38bn"], "publicationDate": "2007-06-24T15:17:54Z", "title": "How competition ate away Britain's chemicals giant", "tags": ["Business", "Victrex"], "article": "The bell is tolling for ICI, the once mighty Imperial Chemical Industries that invented polythene, beta blockers and assorted materials used to make the first atomic bomb. Akzo Nobel has fired off a \u00a37bn bid for the company and although ICI boss John McAdam has rejected the offer as too low, analysts say it is just a matter of time before the Dutch firm renews its attack or others enter the fray. BASF of Germany and America&apos;s Dow Chemical are cited as possible counter-bidders. Turn the clock back 40 years and no one would have believed that ICI faced being gobbled up by a foreign predator. The firm employed 130,000 people from New Zealand to Canada and, like British Petroleum, was viewed practically as an arm of the British state. Today, ICI is a shadow of its former self following three decades of rationalisation. Its market value has fallen from \u00a311bn to \u00a35bn and the workforce has shrunk to just 26,000. But as former chairman Sir Denys Henderson says: &apos;Companies don&apos;t go on for ever and a day: they must adapt to changing circumstances.&apos; The company&apos;s fall from power mirrors the UK&apos;s own post-imperial decline as a manufacturing nation. A former industrial bellwether, ICI supplied raw materials to a country where hundreds of thousands were still employed in shipbuilding, steel and aluminium production and making cars. Heavy chemicals helped to oil the wheels of industry in Britain and the old Commonwealth. But the company&apos;s top brass remained wedded to imperial values in a post-imperial world. Their attitude would astonish investors today. Writing in 1961, ICI chairman Paul Chambers pooh-poohed the notion that the company should move into expanding and more profitable sectors. Instead, he said: &apos;There is a public duty to go on making the essential, basic, chemicals even though the sales may appear to be less progressive and less profitable. ICI could not, for example, withdraw from the production of industrial explosives without giving the government and the public many years&apos; notice of its intention.&apos; History worked against ICI. Before the Second World War, the world chemicals industry was composed of just three companies: IG Farben of Germany, which dominated Europe, DuPont, which controlled the US, and ICI, which spoke for Britain and the Empire. They set their own prices and never competed in each other&apos;s markets. All that changed after the war when regional markets began to break down and firms were exposed to the icy winds of international competition. Arguably, the sheer size of ICI worked to its disadvantage. A former senior manager who worked at the company for 28 years until 1994 said: &apos;We were too big, trying to do too many things. We were in bulk chemicals, pesticides and biosciences. ICI was more diverse than even its main global rivals. Something had to give.&apos; What gave, eventually, were the company&apos;s profits: in 1980 ICI reported its first ever loss and cut the dividend. The results sent shockwaves around the City. Martin Adeney, the former BBC industrial editor who worked in ICI&apos;s communications department for 10 years, says: &apos;The whole business was under pricing pressure and that affected ICI&apos;s ability to maintain its competitive edge. We would come up with a new product, but it was soon copied by rivals in the Middle East or eastern Europe who could supply the same thing for less money.&apos; The business historian Geoffrey Owen has suggested that Britain&apos;s failure to join the Common Market deprived ICI of the kind of growth enjoyed by European firms at a time when continental trade was going through the roof. But, in the long run, Owen reckons that ICI, like many of its competitors, was always on a sticky wicket. &apos;There has been a re-ordering of the chemicals industry and tremendous upheaval. Production is shifting to lower cost centres in the Far East and elsewhere; ICI has been caught in a historical cross-current. So too have others. &apos;Hoechst [the German firm that emerged from IG Farben&apos;s break-up in 1951] has been restructured out of existence; DuPont has survived but has been forced to streamline its operations.&apos; At ICI, there was a brief renaissance in the mid-1980s when it was the first company to make \u00a31bn profit under Sir John Harvey Jones, who sold off lower margin businesses such as soda ash (which goes into glass) and industrial explosives and focused on petrochemicals, polymers, agrochemicals and the fast-expanding pharmaceuticals operation. But when the recession came in 1990, chairman Henderson discovered that the company hadn&apos;t done enough. And then Lord Hanson struck, buying a stake in 1991 and seeking discussions with the board. ICI conducted a remarkable lobbying campaign, convincing even some ministers in the Major government that a Hanson break-up of ICI would be against the national interest. In the end, Hanson didn&apos;t bid, but the cat was out of the bag. A former director says: &apos;We all knew that if Hanson had broken up the company, he would have made a lot of money. The new mantra was shareholder value, so we began to work on ways to break the company up ourselves. &apos;ICI brought in [rising investment banking star] John Mayo from SG Warburg to help with the project. He decided that the firm was in too many product ranges and too many geographies.&apos; Mayo and his team realised that ICI was a chemicals company wrapped in an expanding pharmaceuticals business. That realisation led to the demerger of the pharma arm, renamed Zeneca and separately quoted. Zeneca eventually merged with Astra to become one of the FTSE&apos;s top 30 companies. But the chemicals business seemed to lurch from one crisis to another. In the mid 1990s, chief executive Charles Miller Smith reshuffled the portfolio again, selling what one analyst described as the &apos;cyclical, smelly industrial bits&apos;, and buying Unilever&apos;s higher-margin speciality chemicals. But debt hit \u00a33bn, almost the same as the company&apos;s market valuation. It was time for another round of cost-cutting and rationalisation. Under McAdam, ICI has paid off its borrowings to emerge as a paints company with Dulux as its most famous brand. It also owns National Starch, the US-based adhesives business. Adeney says: &apos;The ICI story is that its home market disappeared with the demise of British manufacturing industries. Linked to that trend has been stiff global competition and constant pressure from shareholders for ICI to reinvent itself.&apos; Owen says those who argue that ICI would have stood a better chance had it been in Europe, where governments are more protectionist, are probably wrong: &apos;It might have slowed down the process of contraction, but the result would have been the same,&apos; he says. In the end, the City viewed ICI as a conglomerate that had overstretched itself and was ripe for unbundling. Ironically, the same fate awaited Lord Hanson&apos;s company, which exploited acquisition accounting rules to assemble - according to investors - assorted businesses under one roof with few synergies and scant commercial logic. It would be wrong, however, to conclude that ICI has been an unmitigated disaster. Zeneca has been successful and so too has ICI&apos;s Australian business, now called Orica, the world&apos;s number one industrial explosives company. A number of ICI&apos;s chemicals operations have been acquired by Ineos, the profitable and privately owned UK mini-multinational. But the fact that parts of the group are still flourishing under new ownership will be little comfort to those who rue the demise of yet another once-great British industrial giant. Arab investors: Britain&apos;s a good home for petrodollars The tide of foreign money flowing into Britain isn&apos;t confined to City takeovers. One of the hottest spots is commercial property, where overseas investors have poured billions into offices, retail and residential premises over the past six years. &apos;There is a wall of money coming in from the Middle East,&apos; says property analyst Mike Prew at Lehman Brothers. &apos;Arab countries are awash with petrodollars, and London properties have been the destination of choice for their cash.&apos; Consultancy DTZ says the value of UK property owned by Middle East investors exceeds the entire portfolio of Land Securities (\u00a314.8bn), the UK&apos;s largest property group. Two of the most expensive homes sold in London last year were bought by Arab investors. The Qatari foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jaber al Thani, paid \u00a3100m for a penthouse at One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge. Gulf investors are also understood to have bought a home in Belgrave Square for \u00a333m. But the biggest London residential deal was done in 2006 when the Abu Dhabi royal family bought 33 Cavendish Square for a staggering \u00a3445m. Elsewhere, Dubai&apos;s Maktoum royal family is said to own a huge portfolio of central London properties, with Lowndes Square often referred to as &apos;Dubai Square&apos;. Analysts say prime City office property is also being targeted by Middle Eastern money, not least because Britain is viewed as more accommodating than the US, where there was a row two years ago about Dubai Ports World taking over US ports as a result of its acquisition of Britain&apos;s P&amp;O. Some on Capitol Hill thought this could pose a security threat. The ports were eventually sold on to assuage concerns, much to the chagrin of Dubai, which views itself as a staunch ally of America and friend of the West. Prew says: &apos;London is seen as a safer bet: some investors have been redirecting funds from the US to new offices in London.&apos; According to DTZ, Middle Eastern investors have spent \u00a38.9bn on commercial property in the past five years. Prew reckons there could be a slowdown in some sectors of commercial property, &apos;but at the top end, there is probably more growth to come&apos;. However, the prospect of Middle Eastern takeovers of large, listed UK companies remains the big talking point in the Square Mile. The spotlight is on supermarket group J Sainsbury, where Delta Two, a Qatari investment group, has acquired a 25 per cent stake, sparking speculation that it could mount a bid.

A Chinese aviation tycoon told the forum that the west was the original polluter, while an American businessman noted that Asia&apos;s energy consumption is relatively disproportionate to its contribution to the world economy. But all participants agreed that instead of apportioning blame, the problem should be solved internationally and with private sector participation. China has come under increasing pressure from the west to take more forceful measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The country relies on coal - among the dirtiest of fuels - to provide two-thirds of its energy. At the conference, the US and Australia were also criticised for not signing the Kyoto protocol, which caps the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that can be emitted in industrialised countries. China is a signatory but because it is considered a developing country it is exempt from emission reductions - a factor often cited by Washington and Canberra as a reason for not accepting the treaty.

They are benefiting from the cheap labour, from the resources and at the same time accusing China of pollution,&quot; said Nor Mohamed.  &quot;There should be no hypocrisy. Let&apos;s take the hypocrisy out of the equation,&quot; he said. &quot;Treat it as a global problem ... the world has to play a role rather than take the issue in a very adversarial or biased basis.&quot; In 2006, China overtook the United States in carbon dioxide emissions by about 7.5%, according to the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency&apos;s report last week. While China was 2% below the US in carbon dioxide emissions in 2005, voracious coal consumption and increased cement production caused the numbers to rise rapidly, the agency said. China uses other statistics to contend that it is not the worst offender: with a population of 1.3 billion people, China releases about 4,762kg (10,500lb) of carbon dioxide per person, while the United States releases nearly 19,277kg (42,500lb) per person. Chen Feng, the chairman of China Hainan Airlines, said &quot;now is not the time&quot; to attribute blame but to create an international solution, noting that the west was the original polluter when its industries were ruining the environment 100 years ago. &quot;So the way I see it is, you (the west) were bandits before you became right-minded people,&quot; he told the discussion. Japan&apos;s environment minister, Masatoshi Wakabayashi, said it was &quot;significant&quot; that President Bush had proposed the 15 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases hold meetings and set an emissions goal. &quot;Without the participation of United States, China and India - the main emitters - we will not stop global warming,&quot; Mr Wakabayashi said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/27/3", "sentences": ["The largest share of the growth in the world&apos;s higher net worth population came from Singapore and India, where numbers rose by 21.2% and 20.5% on the year respectively."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-27T13:59:52Z", "title": "Super-rich get wealthier faster", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "The wealth of the world&apos;s super-rich soared last year at the fastest rate for seven years. The rise in riches was accompanied by a surge in charitable giving to $285bn - believed to be a record.  The downside for the super-rich was that the cost of their favourite luxury products and activities rose at nearly twice the average rate for goods and services.   The 11th annual study of 71 countries by investment bank Merrill Lynch and consultancy firm, Capgemini found that buoyant economic growth across the world pushed the riches of &quot;high net worth individuals&quot; (HNWI) up by a hefty 11.4% last year. The dramatic increase took the total prosperity of the world to $37.2 trillion - equivalent to 15 times the annual output of the UK economy.   High-net worth individuals are those with $1m (\u00a3500,000) to invest in financial assets excluding first homes. Ultra high-net worth individuals have $30m at their disposal.   Britain had the fourth biggest number of the world&apos;s wealthiest, with a total of 484,580 high-net worth individuals, up 8.1% from 2005. Only the US, Japan and Germany have more. Britain is home to 16.7% of Europe&apos;s super-rich.   Part of the rise in world wealth last year came from booming stock markets. The Dow Jones world index, for example, increased by a solid 16.4%.   The boost in cash held by the world&apos;s millionaires and billionaires gave way to a surge in philanthropy, the report said. Rich individuals donated 7% of their wealth to charity, while the ultra-rich donated more than 10% to these causes. This charitable giving amounted to more than $285bn globally.   Warren Buffett, the world&apos;s second-richest man, added to the trend last year when he donated 85% of the $45bn earned from his lifetime of investments to a foundation established by Microsoft&apos;s Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.   &quot;Philanthropy is central to what wealth managers are having to do; it cannot be ignored,&quot; said Nick Tucker, a Merrill Lynch executive director and co-author of the report. &quot;New wealth especially are keen on this.&quot;   Environmental and socially responsible investing were no longer niche categories. Nearly half of all British investment firms invest more than 10% of the assets under their management in socially responsible projects, a rise of 20% from 2004.   The report predicted that global wealth was expected to grow by 6.8% each year until 2011, pushing the total amount to $51.6 trillion, though Mr Tucker warned that a slowing world economy may put a brake on the soaring expansion of wealth over the coming years.   &quot;With many central banks tightening monetary policy, the period of high liquidity that has stimulated recent growth may soon come to an end. The growth rates of Asia and Latin America are expected to ease back as global demand slows. The dual risks of rising energy prices and geopolitical conflicts are a continued threat, adding a level of uncertainty to our current forecasts.&quot;   Britain in particular was facing slowing growth, and therefore a lower generation of wealth, as a result of higher inflation and low household savings rates this year.   There were 9.5 million HNWIs last year, according to the report - a rise of 8.3% from 2005. Europe saw its wealth increase at the sharpest rate since 2000, with a rise of 7.8% to $10 trillion. The performance of financial markets in eastern Europe in particular was a key driver in this, Mr Tucker said. Ultra-HNWIs also rapidly increased by 11.3% to 94,970 last year.   The largest share of the growth in the world&apos;s higher net worth population came from Singapore and India, where numbers rose by 21.2% and 20.5% on the year respectively. This continued the rise of a new elite of super-rich individuals in developing nations as their economies expanded, in the case of India and China at rates more than triple that of the UK.   Many of these emerging economies, which included Russia, were gaining strength from domestic private consumption, competitive services and manufacturing sectors.   Wealth generated in Latin America, the Middle East and Russia was buoyed up by high commodity and oil prices.   &quot;The globalisation of wealth creation has accelerated,&quot; said Chris Gant, head of wealth management at Capgemini Financial Services. &quot;If 2005 was characterised by a flow of investment to international funds from HNWIs, 2006 ushered in a new era whereby emerging economies leaped ahead with direct foreign investment, strong domestic demand and hefty stock market gains.&quot;   The report found that as the rich got richer, the demand for luxury products increased, making them more expensive. The Cost of Living Extremely Well Index (CLEWI) measured the cost of a basket of 42 luxury goods and services, including designer handbags, tuition at Harvard University and filet mignon.   Last year, this index rose nearly twice as fast as the cost of everyday consumer products. The CLEWI rose at 7% while the consumer price index increased by 4%.   The world&apos;s millionaires nevertheless devoted about a quarter of their &quot;investments of passion&quot; to yachts and private jets, dubbed &quot;mobile mansions,&quot; and a fifth to art.   The report said more investors were moving their money out of the US to Europe and to a lesser extent Asia. This was likely to be because of signs of a slowdown in the US economy. The study found investment in property showed a large rise thanks to spiralling prices.

Last year, the Australian government issued 113,936 working holiday visas, with nearly 30,000 of them going to British applicants. It&apos;s a big adventure, but doesn&apos;t have to be a complicated one. It&apos;s simply a case of knowing where to look.   The working holiday visa  The Working Holiday Visa allows holders to stay in Australia for up to a year, working for a maximum of six months with any one employer. During this 12-month period, holders may leave and enter the country as many times as they wish.  The visa must be applied for outside of Australia, and applicants must be between the ages of 18 and 30. Evidence of having sufficient funding for the trip is also required - a certified bank statement showing AU$5,000 (\u00a32,120) in your account and a return plane ticket. Applications can be made online at the Australian Immigration Department&apos;s website. The visa costs AU$185 (\u00a380).  Note: Visa eligibility requirements, costs and entitlements are subject to change \u2013 check before applying.   Getting there  The simplest way is getting a return flight, with the best value coming from the less prominent Asian airlines, such as China Eastern, Malaysia Airlines and Royal Brunei. Most airlines will include a free stop-off on the way, as it is inevitably two flights rather than one. Rock bottom prices start at around \u00a3550 return, although in practice expect to pay \u00a3700 to \u00a3900.  Round-the-world tickets are also worth considering \u2013 they work out slightly more expensive, but include a series of stop-offs. Expect to pay between \u00a3900 and \u00a31,300 with specialists such as STA Travel and Roundtheworldflights.com.  One thing to bear in mind is the destination city. Many fly into Sydney, blow most of their money there and end up staying for most of the year. It&apos;s worth considering flights into Darwin, Cairns or, particularly, Perth. The latter tends to be slightly cheaper. Another potentially cheaper option is getting a return to Thailand or Singapore then using a budget carrier such as Tiger Airways to get to Perth or Darwin.  The more adventurous can go the long way, over land and sea from London to Sydney. Oz Bus runs a mammoth 12-week tour through 20 countries for \u00a33,750.   Getting around  Most Australians fly between the major cities, which is unsurprising given the vast distances - it&apos;s roughly as far from Darwin to Sydney as it is from Oslo to Istanbul. The main airlines are Qantas (plus its budget subsidiary, Jetstar) and Virgin Blue . The same theories apply to these as to European budget airlines \u2013 flights are cheaper booked in advance and at unpopular hours of the day.  However, flying from place to place somewhat defeats the object \u2013 much of the country&apos;s character is unveiled in the long journeys through country towns and pure nothingness.  In terms of freedom to explore, buying or renting a car or van is the best option. The cheapest cars can be found advertised by fellow travellers on hostel notice boards, although the safer bets are sold and hired by specialist companies such as Travellers Autobarn  and Wicked Campers. Prices range from AU$1,000 to AU$10,000, depending on vehicle type, age and roadworthiness.  The other option is the bus. The Greyhound network covers most of the country, and sells passes based on either route or distance. It&apos;s the cheapest way to get from A to B to Z, but it can be a pretty unexciting way to travel. Then there are tour companies such as Oz Experience, Adventure Tours and Wayward Bus. Geared to the backpacker, these prove more expensive, but can be more fun and informative.   Package deals  Many of the more popular destinations and activities are bundled together in package deals by specialist backpacker travel agents. These include Backpackers World, Adventure Travel Bugs, Wanderers Travel and Peter Pans. Generally these deals will represent a considerable saving on buying the components (usually a Whitsundays sailing trip, Fraser Island 4WD safari and numerous free nights&apos; accommodation in hostels) individually. However, there are usually extra costs involved - insurance, park entrance fees etc \u2013 and there is often very good reason for a bargain basement price. The included hostels can sometimes be miles out of town, while the baseline Whitsundays yachts tend to be very crowded, with poor catering and facilities. It pays to investigate exactly what is provided for the price.   Accommodation  Australia has the most geared-up, extensive hostel network in the world. Some are still very basic, but the sheer level of competition means most have had to buck up their game. This has led to many resort-style one stop shops (particularly in the north), and more upmarket &quot;flashpacker&quot; hostels, such as those in the Base chain. Bigger doesn&apos;t necessarily mean better, though \u2013 many of the larger complexes are utterly lacking in charm. Word of mouth is the most reliable indicator, especially in the smaller towns.  Very few people continue to stay in a hostel if staying in a city (usually Sydney, Melbourne or Perth) to work for a while. Estate agents usually insist on six-month contracts at the very least, and properties usually come unfurnished. As a result, many backpackers end up in (not entirely above board) shared flats, the new person handing their bond money to the person leaving. These are particularly prevalent in Pyrmont, Sydney and St Kilda, Melbourne, and are generally found through word of mouth and notice boards. Expect to pay between $100 and $250 a week in rent, depending on the quality of accommodation.  Backpacker magazines such as British Balls!  and TNT  are also good sources of longer-term accommodation.   Work  If blessed with specialised skills and qualifications, finding work is a doddle. Tradespeople and nurses are always in demand, while gold can be struck in IT and accounting. Otherwise, the work on offer is generally poorly paid and not particularly glamorous - welcome to call centres, fruit farms and bars. Again, the backpacker magazines have good job listings and contacts, while agencies such as Work And Travel , Freespirit and Geoffrey Nathan specialise in placing backpackers. It&apos;s not worth bothering with the more mainstream agencies \u2013 unless you meet their requirements, they generally couldn&apos;t care less.  Many jobs \u2013 especially in bars and restaurants - aren&apos;t advertised. A bit of legwork, nipping in and dropping off a CV can pay dividends. There may not be any vacancies at the time, but when there are, your name is down.  If struggling to find work, it&apos;s worth moving to another city. In November and December, for example, Sydney is crammed with backpackers, all looking for temporary work.   Money  The cost of living in Australia is slightly cheaper than it is in the UK, but not by much. The days of three dollars to the pound are long gone \u2013 expect an exchange rate of around 2.4.  It is possible to get off the plane with hardly anything in the bank and walk into a job within a few days, but unlikely. The Australian government figure of AU$5,000 is a little over-cautious, but it&apos;s worth having enough to live on for at least six weeks. How much you need depends on spending habits and (largely) alcohol consumption.  Pay rates are very ordinary \u2013 expect AU$13-$17 per hour in bars and restaurants, $20-$30 an hour for accounting work, for example.  The base tax rate for non-residents is 29%. In some circumstances, it is possible to get a partial refund at the end of the financial year. Try companies such as Taxback.com to check eligibility. Be warned, however, that non-residents without a tax file number  are taxed at 46.5% - get one as soon after arrival as possible.   Tried-and-tested destinations  By far the most common route is up the East Coast from Sydney to Cairns. Chilling out in Byron Bay, driving and camping on Fraser Island and sailing around the Whitsunday Islands  on the Great Barrier Reef are practically obligatory activities. Most will visit Melbourne and Darwin too. For tours, the big four tend to be Cape Tribulation in Far North Queensland, The Great Ocean Road in Victoria, the Red Centre and Kakadu National Park.   Other destinations  The West Coast is becoming an increasingly popular (and far less crowded) alternative. It even has its own reef \u2013 the Ningaloo. For somewhere completely out of the way, there is Kimberley in the north-west, while up-and-coming spots on the East Coast include Coffs Harbour, the Town of 1770 and Mission Beach.   Staying longer  It is possible to get a second working holiday visa . However, applicants for this extension must have done seasonal work in a regional area for at least three months.  Other options for staying include sponsorship, for which applicants must have an Australian company willing to back their application, and permanent residency for those with skills in high demand.

The memories come flooding back: of the crew member who turned up at the pier in a chauffeur-driven limo, dressed in a captain&apos;s suit; the ship&apos;s chef who gave up a radio cookery show to join the voyage. The other diners are oblivious to the identity of the frail old man who lights yet another cigarette and then fixes the listener, his friend Avi Livney, with piercing eyes. He is 83-year-old Ike Aronowitz, former captain of the illegal immigrant ship Exodus. Who would recognise him? He is known to the world in an entirely different incarnation: as the blond, blue-eyed Paul Newman, who played Aronowitz in Otto Preminger&apos;s 1960 film Exodus, based on Leon Uris&apos;s blockbuster novel of the same name. Both film and book tell the story of the postwar illegal immigration ships bearing a human cargo of Holocaust survivors who tried to break the British blockade of Palestine in the last days of the Mandate. It was an incident that would become part of the founding mythology of Israel, legendary because the fictionalised account came to symbolise the birth of a nation and generated international sympathy and support. But it was a fairy tale. In Uris&apos;s version, the Jewish refugees, stranded on Cyprus, are saved by a sympathetic British general who convinces the British government to allow the ship to land. In real life, the British army boarded, killed three people, loaded the passengers on to prison ships and took them back to Hamburg. When Uris was researching his novel in 1956, he interviewed Aronowitz, who was unimpressed by his credentials: &quot;I told him: you&apos;re a great writer of bestsellers, but for history you&apos;re the wrong guy. He was very offended.&quot; Two years after the end of the war, 200,000 homeless, stateless Jews were still in displaced-persons camps all over Europe, while Britain and the US placed visa restrictions on entry to their own country. Britain, which then ruled Palestine, issued only 1,500 entry permits a month in an attempt to limit immigration for fear of increasing ethnic tensions. The Zionist policy of illegal immigration was part humanitarian rescue mission, part political gerrymandering of the country&apos;s population. It gave Holocaust survivors hope of a new home, but was also designed to flood Palestine with Jews ahead of the UN partition vote expected in November 1947. For the Exodus&apos;s American crew, the trip was an incredible adventure. Though young, many were experienced seamen just out of the wartime navy, and were recruited by word of mouth in the Jewish community, their heads buzzing with Zionism. As Americans, they saw themselves as re-enacting their founding fathers&apos; anti-colonial struggle in the War of Independence; as Jews, they were enraged about the plight of the refugees. New Yorker Avi Livney was 19, fresh out of the navy and asking around about how he could get on to one of the ships. The initial response was discouraging; official Jewish and Zionist bodies disclaimed all knowledge of the operations. &quot;Ultimately, I got a call from somebody telling me to meet him in the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, a place I had never been. A number of weeks went by and then I got another call. They told me they had a ship ready to go - it was called the President Warfield.&quot; Livney was sent to Baltimore, where he got a taxi to the pier: &quot;We drove along past all these magnificent ships, we got to the end and I thought we must have missed it. Then I saw a hulk. It was an embarrassment, not a ship.&quot; The President Warfield had started life as a luxury 200-berth steamer taking wealthy passengers up and down Chesapeake Bay. At the start of the war, it had been commandeered by the navy to ferry troops for the D-day landings; returned to the US to be sold for scrap, it had been bought for 40,000 of the collected dollars of US Jews. It nearly sank when it first left Baltimore and had to return to port for repairs. Eventually, it set sail for Marseille amid press speculation about what a ship supposedly bound for China was doing with Mediterranean charts. Stopping at the Azores, Livney says, they were greeted by US sailors who jeered, &quot;Are you going to run the British blockade in that? Big secret!&quot; While the ship made its way across the Atlantic, a parallel organisational structure was moving Jews from the displaced-persons camps to southern France, where the ships would arrive. Norbert (now Noah) Klieger was born in Strasbourg in 1926; his father, a journalist and author, foreseeing that Hitler would start a war, had moved his family to Belgium, believing it would stay neutral. After the invasion, father and son joined an underground resistance group, but in 1943, aged 16, Noah was picked up and deported to Auschwitz, and his father and mother were sent there a year later. He ended up in Auschwitz Monowitz, the rubber factory, where he worked alongside Primo Levi and was forced to join the Auschwitz boxing squad, in which Jews fought each other for the amusement of the commandants. Auschwitz, not political ideology, made Klieger a Zionist. &quot;I realised that the only solution for the Jewish people was for there to be a country they could run to.&quot; Surviving both the camps and the death marches, he eventually found himself just outside Ravensbr\u00fcck, where he was liberated in April 1945 by the Red Army, which held the inmates for two months, hoping to send them to the Soviet Union. Klieger smuggled himself into the French zone and joined Mossad Aliyah Bet, the precursor to Mossad, which at the time was in charge of protecting Jews in the Diaspora. For the whole of 1946, Klieger was involved with the European end of the clandestine immigration operation, which had offices and agents across the continent. David Passow, who had been ordained as a rabbi in America during the war, became the New England director of the American Christian Palestine Committee, a network of American Christians of all denominations who were supporting clandestine immigration, with contacts, he says, in the Vatican. Passow was sent to Europe, where a Methodist newspaper, Zion&apos;s Herald, gave him press accreditation that allowed him to move freely across borders. In charge of the Warsaw office, his role was to build public support for illegal immigration and to convince apprehensive Jewish refugees that they should try to get to Palestine. &quot;They needed reassurance in all forms,&quot; he says. &quot;The passport to the whole thing was to give them some kind of hope. The reaction ranged from total negation to total acceptance and anticipation. But what was most striking to them was that I was an American who spoke Yiddish.&quot; One hundred and 60 trucks were chartered to bring refugees from the camps to Marseille, where the President Warfield was waiting - a manoeuvre complicated by a France-wide strike that required a union payoff. By now Klieger had decided it was time to go to Palestine himself. &quot;I sat in the cabin of the first truck. When we got to port, I said, &apos;Where is the ship?&apos; I figured that for $40,000 it would be something like the Queen Elizabeth. I said, &apos;This is a ship?&apos; &quot; The crew had ripped out what remained of the interior and built shelves to house the 4,500 passengers, each with enough space to lie down, reminding them of the concentration camps they had left. Also on board were 150 Zionist Jews from North Africa. Klieger was given a blue and white armband and told to prevent passengers from ascending to the bridge. &quot;All of a sudden a young kid came along, whistling, wearing nothing but shorts, plimsolls and a cap. He was determined to climb up and I thought I was going to have to hit him. It turned out this was Ike, the captain. He was 23 and he looked 16.&quot; &quot;Ike&quot; was the Haganah (the main Palestine Zionist organisation) codename for Yitzhak Aronowitz. A short, black-haired Pole, he was born in Lodz and grew up in Danzig, until his father presciently took the family to Palestine in 1936. Unlike Klieger, with his first-hand experience of the firm grasp of Soviet hospitality, at the start of the war Ike had romantic ideas about the egalitarian Red Army and swift promotion. Accused of being all talk, he gave in and joined the British merchant marines. He had nothing personal against the sailors he met, but to Jews in Palestine Europe was a hell of death and endemic anti-semitism. They saw themselves not as western colonial implants in the Arab world but, like their US counterparts, involved in a worldwide struggle against British imperialism, drawing inspiration from the struggle for Indian independence. Aronowitz had sailed aboard the President Warfield from Baltimore as the first mate under a non-Jewish American captain who was paid off once he had got the ship across the Atlantic. Promoted to captain, it was his first command. Despite his inexperience, he proved a sailor of chutzpah and skill. Closely watched by the French authorities, the ship had to slip out of Marseille to the port of S\u00e8te, just up the coast, to evade detection. Unable to afford a tug, they had paid a pilot but he hadn&apos;t turned up, and Aronowitz had to negotiate a series of tricky turns to get the ship through the narrow channels and into open water. &quot;Ike was a genius,&quot; Klieger says. They left on July 11 1947. It was a seven-day voyage to Palestine, and despite the discomfort and the limited chance of success, the passengers were optimistic. &quot;The atmosphere was incredible,&quot; Klieger says. &quot;We had a radio broadcasting in four languages, we had folk dances, we sang. There were women who taught the children, everything was organised. The spirit was something out of this world - they knew that, at worst, they&apos;d get sent to camps in Cyprus. They would not be free, but what was the big deal? Ninety-five per cent were [Holocaust] survivors, they were ready to endure anything, because they knew that the partition vote was coming and in a few months there would be a Jewish country.&quot; For the young crew, this was the first time they&apos;d come face to face with survivors, and they spoke to them using their common lingua franca, Yiddish, emphasising both the common bonds of culture and the sense of a shared destiny. &quot;I was once talking to a group my own age,&quot; Livney says, &quot;and at the end one girl told a particularly harrowing story and said she had only one wish, to have her own table. I&apos;ve never forgotten that, and I&apos;ve gone on wondering whether eventually she got her own table.&quot; The crew had been sworn into the Haganah when they left America, and the leadership in Palestine had also sent what Aronowitz - already rankling at attempts to exert authority over what he saw as his ship - calls &quot;a political commissar&quot;, Yossi Harel, a senior Haganah member. Tensions erupted between the Americans and what were then called Palestinians (Jewish residents of Mandate Palestine). The Haganah radioed the ship, ordering it to change its name to the Exodus 1947, which many of the Americans hated. &quot;We wanted something with more zip,&quot; Livney says. &quot;Personally, I wanted it to be called the Eleanor Roosevelt.&quot; As the ship neared the Palestine coast, it found itself hemmed in by British destroyers. Harel said the point had been made and they should give in. &quot;He didn&apos;t want us to resist the British,&quot; Aronowitz says. &quot;He wanted us to surrender. But most of the passengers were more courageous and had more guts than any of us - they had seen terrible things.&quot; Aronowitz rebelled. The crew had prepared plans to repel the British soldiers by placing nets over the deck, but they didn&apos;t have time to get them out when the surprise raid took place at midnight on July 18 and they resorted to throwing cans of kosher corned beef at the boarding party. There were three casualties: two passengers - one a 16-year-old boy, shot in the face, according to a witness - and one of the young crew, Bill Bernstein, who was clubbed to death with a rifle butt. He died in Aronowitz&apos;s bunk. The battle with the British was not only played out on radio and in the newsreels. Representatives of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (Unscop) had been sent to Haifa as observers. The brutal treatment of the Exodus&apos;s passengers had become a powerful propaganda tool in the Zionist campaign, but in Jaffa, 15-year-old Hasan Hammami, the son of a wealthy Arab businessman, watched and listened with foreboding: &quot;I remember seeing pictures of the Exodus as it was being towed into port in Haifa. Its pictures were in the papers. I remember clearly the news about this and other illegal immigrant ships. Most were regularly reported on the official radio station, which broadcast in Arabic and was located less than half a mile from our house. &quot;The mood was one of sorrow for the poor, weak, hungry Jews who had come from European concentration camps, and of the condition they&apos;d been driven to,&quot; Hammami says. &quot;But it was mixed with fear of being overrun by European Jewish immigrants. There was bewilderment and anger - why were they being sent to Palestine, given all this aid to settle in a land that did not belong to the power that was admitting them and that they did not own?&quot; All the passengers were forcibly disembarked at Haifa - the crew had hiding places on board and were able to slip away and evade arrest. The rest were loaded on to three British ships, imprisoned in cages and returned to Europe. On arrival in France, they refused to disembark and after three weeks at Port-de-Bouc, amid worldwide publicity, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin took what seems now the inconceivable step of returning them to Hamburg, where they were re-incarcerated in refugee camps. It was a PR catastrophe. &quot;Back to the Reich,&quot; one US newspaper put it. &quot;Return to the death land,&quot; said another. &quot;If there is an Almighty,&quot; Aronowitz says, &quot;he sent us Ernest Bevin in order to create a Jewish state.&quot; The story of the voyage of the Exodus ended there. The ship remained in Haifa harbour until 1952, when it caught fire and burned to the waterline; the hulk was towed to Shemen beach. &quot;It was the greatest tragedy of my life,&quot; Aronowitz says. &quot;I thought we had lost this battle, but I wrote to John Grauer [a Methodist minister and the only non-Jewish member of the crew], &apos;If we have one more defeat like this, Britain&apos;s empire will sink into oblivion.&apos; &quot; In 1948, after the British Mandate formally came to an end, during what Israelis call the War of Independence and what Palestinians call the Nakba (the Catastrophe), the Hammamis were driven out of Jaffa. Another refugee ship set sail, this time in the opposite direction. Hasan says, &quot;We left in a Mediterranean saiq, a traditional cargo boat, [with] more than 3,000 people like sardines, escaping for their lives. We ran out of water in the first few hours, I saw a woman abort three feet away, and we were intercepted by British navy ships several times and they let us go.&quot; After days at sea, they arrived in Lebanon, where the now penniless family struggled to make a living and give their children an education. Hasan wandered from one country to the next, eventually settling in Florida, where he had a successful career as an engineer. Aronowitz, now 83, became a ship owner running lines to China, Singapore and Iran. Livney and his wife live on Kibbutz Barkai, a short drive from Aronowitz&apos;s house where, this year, the day after Independence Day, the red flag was flying proudly alongside its Israeli counterpart from the roof of the communal building. Passow, now 89, retired two years ago from a professorship at Hebrew University and lives in Jerusalem. Klieger was reunited with his parents in Brussels and made it to Israel six days after the state was declared. He became a journalist and is on the editorial board of Israel&apos;s leading newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, where, at 81, he still goes to work every day, the forearm on which his Auschwitz number is tattooed bent over his keyboard. Politically, they all took different directions. Livney, a teenage member of the Hashomer Hatzair socialist-Zionist youth movement in New York, maintains his socialist convictions - he and his wife have been active members of Peace Now. Aronowitz, who started out on the left, developed a feud with prime minister David Ben-Gurion in the early 50s, when Ben-Gurion broke a shipping strike, driving Aronowitz to the right, perhaps more out of intransigence than ideology. As Livney says diplomatically, Aronowitz was always strong-willed - a couple of weeks earlier, he&apos;d briefly hit the headlines again, this time for being in court for driving without a licence for 18 years. To Klieger, a specialist writer on anti-semitism, European anti-Zionism remains inexplicable: &quot;How can a normal European think we are wrong?&quot; he says. &quot;Not only do they think we are wrong, they say we are wrong, that we are Nazis!&quot; Listening to these old men in a sunlit restaurant as they talk about events of six decades ago, one is struck by how the history of Zionism, and the Zionist policy of illegal immigration that brought hope to Jewish refugees and made new refugees out of Palestinians, has an additional meaning we have half-forgotten - that in taking on the British empire, the survivors of an attempt at total genocide were recovering their pride and dignity, their sense of being human. The defiance of the blockade helped them overcome their shame at having been victims. &quot;I would say that if I had to do it again, because, God forbid, we had an extreme situation, I would,&quot; Passow says. &quot;There is no question that it was an act of heroism and proved that, when push comes to shove, the Jewish people were capable of great things. Of course, living in Israel today, you wouldn&apos;t say that.&quot; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jun/30/saturday.hotels", "sentences": ["Back in my cabin I try not to flick Singapore noodles, delivered in acarton, on to the bed linen while watching Helen Mirren in The Queen.Air-con noise and audible voices in the corridor mimic real flying just alittle too closely and I surface before the alarm."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-30T15:16:00Z", "title": "Yotel,  Gatwick Airport", "tags": ["Hotels", "Travel", "London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "England holidays"], "article": "Simon Woodroffe, the man who brought us Yo!

So it&apos;s unsettling beyond the usual effects of the genre to read a book by a writer who has recently died. The shadow of mortality and mourning that is a basic requirement of mysteries is doubled in the case of End Games, Michael Dibdin&apos;s 11th novel about the Italian cop Aurelio Zen, because the advance copies began to circulate just after the news of the writer&apos;s death on March 30, nine days after his 60th birthday. Whatever state Zen is in on the final page of End Games, he has no chance of surviving this book. The tying up of ends in the final chapter will not, for most readers, achieve the catharsis that is one of the reasons such stories have appeal. The author&apos;s sudden absence haunts us far past the last page. Officially, the title of the final Zen book alludes to a plot involving a film company shooting, in Italy, a movie based on the apocalyptic Book of Revelation. As the director explains in a television interview: in &quot;our post-9/11 world, the Book of Revelation touches many exposed cultural nerves. We all know that if terrorists gain access to nuclear or biological weapons, it will quite literally mean the end of the world.&quot; Dibdin&apos;s end, though, has encouraged the book&apos;s name to be taken in a different way. Because of the finality of the title - and the fact that the story begins with the ominously prophetic words &quot;The dead man&quot; - there has been an assumption, reflected in some obituaries, that End Games was consciously a final work, for both Dibdin and Zen. The possibility of the detective&apos;s death has been strong since Blood Rain (1999), in which he seemed to have been dispatched by a Mafia car bomb in the final paragraph. Although there were four more books, this hint of the hero&apos;s expendability gave Dibdin&apos;s creation a sense of fragility that few series characters attain. Paradoxically, though, End Games is not obviously an acknowledged finale, though there is, for the reader particularly alert to clues, a rather circuitous inclusion of the word &quot;tomb&quot; in a climactic, and otherwise optimistic, paragraph, as well as an odd, brutal reference to a medical condition that seems to have no functional purpose within the book. Otherwise, it is energetically and meticulously written, and the longest novel in the Zen series. There is, perhaps, one other subtle indication of a writer knowingly book-ending his career or, at least, one sequence of novels. In the last paragraph of Ratking, the 1988 story that introduced Aurelio Zen, the detective, walking home, notes that &quot;the sky was clear and littered with stars&quot;. Almost 20 years on, as he enters the final pages of what we now know to be his last case, Zen looks to the heavens and regrets that light pollution has largely obliterated this natural illumination: &quot;[Within] his lifetime that celestial array had been erased like a medieval fresco gaudily overpainted in a more enlightened era.&quot; Another possible suggestion of a writer turning to what the Roman Catholic church calls &quot;last things&quot; is that the Italian cop seems more conspicuously interested in religion than before, even more than when, in Cabal (1992), he was actually investigating a mystery within the Vatican. In End Games, he worries about his &quot;sin list&quot;, quotes the Latin mass at one witness, then warns her that, if she fails to co-operate, &quot;even the blessed sacraments may not suffice to ensure the salvation of your soul&quot;. At another point, Dibdin seems to have got a detail of Catholic theology - the Holy Trinity - wrong, but it turns out that the character, an old lady raised devoutly, has adopted a deliberate and revealing heresy. Underlining this ecclesiastical patterning, the book&apos;s recurrent metaphor for Zen is spiritual. His face is first compared to &quot;the frescoed image of some minor saint who was being martyred&quot;. When he enters the interrogation room, a witness notes him as &quot;a handsome man with the appearance of a certain kind of priest ... suggesting a basic bent towards such kindness and indulgence as he might be able to reconcile with the strict rules of his calling&quot;. During a second interview, the same witness directly asks whether Zen&apos;s mother wanted him &quot;to be a priest rather than a policeman&quot;. His spoken reply is that he had &quot;no vocation&quot;, but Dibdin then gives him a silent thought that anyone who has followed the character through 11 books is tempted to chisel in the memory as an epitaph: &quot;But I do have a vocation ... it&apos;s this stupid, meaningless, utterly compromised job that I try to do as well as I can.&quot; Zen&apos;s near-contempt for his profession is one of Dibdin&apos;s most significant contributions to modern British crime fiction. He took Italy as his location because he had come to love the country and speak the language while teaching at the university of Perugia. But the decision to set the series outside the UK was perhaps also an acceptance that his home readership would not, at least 20 years ago, accept him being quite so consistently maudlin about the British force. PD James&apos;s Dalgleish, Ruth Rendell&apos;s Wexford, Reginald Hill&apos;s Dalziel and Colin Dexter&apos;s Morse all have moments of doubt and self-laceration during investigations, and it has sometimes seemed that resignation might end the career of Ian Rankin&apos;s Rebus before retirement does. But, from the very beginning of Ratking, when he seems at risk of being sacked after botching a politically sensitive investigation, Zen encourages the reader to think he has chosen the wrong job. Some of this comes from geographical accuracy: an Italian cop has to deal with a legacy of corruption and dizzily rotating political administrations. Zen&apos;s morality is one of the most absorbing areas of the portraits. Modern fictional cops are maverick almost by default - Rebus and Dalziel delight in ignoring new Home Office guidelines - but Dibdin&apos;s detective frequently resorts to illegality: planting or ignoring evidence, suborning witnesses, even, in And Then You Die (2002), committing an act that, if discovered, would merit a life sentence. Yet, when Zen breaks the law, it is because it seems to be the only way of enforcing the law within the Italian system. That the cop is to some extent on the run from what he has previously done, a burden left to the villains in most other crime fiction, significantly shapes his personality. In the later books - especially the penultimate Back to Bologna (2005) - Zen is suffering from disabling depression, an aspect of his personality that even the loosest acquaintance of Dibdin suspected to be autobiographical. But to have described Dibdin&apos;s fiction in the previous section as &quot;British&quot;, though technically correct, feels uneasy. As a writer who was born in Wolverhampton and educated in Belfast but died in his final adopted home city of Seattle, Dibdin was always hard to pin on a map. So, in retrospect, it&apos;s not surprising that he should have become one of the few novelists who set the majority of their books outside the country of their birth. There are almost 3,000 Italian pages in the Zen sequence, and only two of Dibdin&apos;s other seven novels - The Tryst (1989) and Dirty Tricks (1991) - are set in contemporary England. After becoming a &quot;resident alien&quot; in the US to be with the writer KK Beck, his third wife, he soon wrote two novels in a contemporary American voice: Dark Spectre (1995) and Thanksgiving (2000). Fascinated by vocabulary, Dibdin was a magpie of language, and this became reflected in an accent that had already been complicated in childhood by the imposition of Northern Ireland on British black country. The language of End Games properly reflects Dibdin&apos;s eclectic lexicon. The basic storytelling tone is simple, but ominous English: &quot;Mirella and Tom were walking up an inclined alley in the old town when the attack occurred.&quot; And, as always in his fiction, the narrative voice enjoys frequent English wordplay: the history of religious cinema is neatly summarised as running from &quot;De Mille to Mel&quot;. There&apos;s also a risky reference to a computer&apos;s &quot;Down&apos;s Syndrome software&quot;, which reflects the author&apos;s intermittent truculence about the polite sensitivities of English society. He once suggested on television that theatres staging Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals should be blown up. Inevitably, though, most of the dialogue in these books has to represent Italian conversation. The early Zens employed the usual compromise of anglophone writers operating overseas - English dialogue with an occasional flavouring of localisms: Questura, Signora. Gradually, Faber &amp; Faber&apos;s printers were required to make more and more use of their italic font and, with End Games, the publisher might think about giving away a Berlitz guide as a tie-in. A key plot-point at the end of one chapter is delivered in untranslated Italian and, within the English dialogue, there is a subtle misunderstanding between a Calabrian and an outsider speaking Italian. The local explains: &quot;An easy mistake for a foreigner. Our verbal forms are very complex.&quot; Aptly, this book&apos;s idiom also reflects the writer&apos;s other adopted country. Symbolically, one character has plans to open a trattoria in Calabria serving US food. And several chapters, which use the viewpoint of an American who has come to Italy as a movie producer scouting locations for the Revelation film, are written in American west coast rhythms: &quot;By the time his modified 737 finally touched down at wherever the fuck it was, Jake felt pretty well bummed.&quot; So consistent is the ventriloquism that one of Jake&apos;s sentences makes sense only if the letter Z is read to rhyme with &quot;bee&quot;, in the stateside way. An Anglo-Italian-American writer, Dibdin is represented in this final book by all three of his dialects. In that sense, the book could not be a more appropriate coda, because his work represents a sort of unification of modern detective fiction. In the three decades of Dibdin&apos;s publishing career, the traditional English crime novel has been refreshed by influence from Europe - especially the novels of Scandinavian writers such as Henning Mankell and Karin Fossum - and America: the dense, violent, sardonic fiction of James Ellroy, James Lee Burke, Robert Parker, George Pelecanos and others. Many younger British writers were guided by these imported styles to make their books darker, funnier and more internationally aware, but only Dibdin went as far as to base his fiction in continental Europe and the US. But, revealingly, even within their chosen foreign country, the Zens were restless. Most fictional sleuths, in line with usual police practice, have a single patch: Edinburgh for Rebus, Oxford for Morse, Brighton for Peter James&apos;s Roy Grace. Dibdin&apos;s cop, though Venetian by birth, operated nationally rather than locally, seconded to a different Italian region in each book. This had the benefit of providing Dibdin with a new cuisine and dialect each time and giving the central character the permanent status, always useful in a narrative, of an outsider. It also gave considerable emotional force to the mystery in which Zen worked for the first time among the canals and basilicas of his birthplace: Dead Lagoon (1994). Fittingly, End Games brings him to one of Italy&apos;s limits: Calabria, in the toe of what schoolchildren are taught to call the &quot;boot&quot; of the nation&apos;s shape on a map. In this distant and institutionally suspicious terrain, an American business traveller has been kidnapped, a crime that, again, perhaps deliberately echoes the missing man set-up in Zen&apos;s first Ratking investigation. This last book feels like a summation of Dibdin&apos;s feelings about the country he adopted fictionally. The significance of Catholicism in this novel could be explained, apart from any escalating sense of mortality in the author, by a desire to capture every significant aspect of Italy in one storyline. The Fellini-esque movie director, Aldobrandini, who &quot;won the silver at Venice back in the 1960s&quot; and sails around the Adriatic on his yacht, drinking Singapore Slings while preparing to shoot a movie for his American backers, can be taken as a similar attempt at inclusivity. Culture, religion, politics: the novel is as thorough as a checklist for a visiting diplomat. And, throughout, the writer aphorises about the country with a rueful authority more common in the native. One character is &quot;in the most desperate situation in which any Italian can ever find himself. He was alone.&quot; Elsewhere, someone observes: &quot;Italians always seemed to know where they were in space ... Maybe that was why they were so good at art.&quot; In the final chapter, the authorial voice delivers a moving and truthful geopolitical pr\u00e9cis: &quot;Everything went wrong all the time, but somehow it didn&apos;t matter, while in other countries even if everything went perfectly, life was still a misery.&quot; Though he was familiar with the misery of life, Dibdin, in up moods, knew how to enjoy himself. Once commissioned to write a book about wine (he failed to complete it), he was a writer of appetite, his sentences lingering over lip-glistening descriptions of sex and food, although those tastes were indulged in different areas of his fiction. Culinary consumption is generally to be found in the Zen books. Within 20 pages of Ratking, Zen is eating lamb in a restaurant, despite already having had soup and spaghetti alla carbonara at home, and the banquet reaches a final course in End Games. There might be a case for this book being stamped with one of those new government traffic-light panels, warning of its calorific contents. Indicating the depth of his depression, Zen has for once lost his appetite in the early sections, nauseated by the obsession of Calabrian cooking with the tomato. The American characters, though, are tucking into &quot;ribbons of home-made egg pasta overlaid with chunks of unctuous porcini ... aged ewe&apos;s-milk cheese and slabs of Amedi dark chocolate.&quot; During the Sherlock Holmes moment in which he deciphers what actually happened in the kidnapping, the detective is treating himself to an alfresco picnic in the mountains, chewing &quot;a sharp sheep&apos;s cheese, chunks of crusty wholewheat bread baked in a wood-fired oven&quot;. Beyond reflecting the author&apos;s own eager and curious palate, the reason for all these meals is that, in Italian culture, food reveals history and regional distinction. Also, Zen, as a depressive whose job unsettles him, eats as a distraction and a comfort. Interestingly, given the increasingly dominant comparisons between the policeman and a priest, sex seems to play little role in Zen&apos;s life. In End Games, for example, the only moment of tumescence occurs through food, when the dining policeman savours &quot;the soft clitoral gristle of the clams&quot;. Zen&apos;s literary celibacy may have been partly a marketing decision. These books were increasingly targeted at the PD James and Ruth Rendell market, where readers are potentially decorous. Indeed, it is a curious fact that intercourse is more or less outlawed for the investigating figure in British detective fiction. Apart from Wexford, who is married, the other major detectives - Poirot, Marple, Dalgleish, Morse, Rebus, Zen - are all single through all or most of their mysteries. Divorced when the series begins, Zen is permitted occasional relationships and, by End Games, is married to Gemma, a witness in a previous case. But because each of his cases requires travel, he remains alone in his encounters with the reader, enforcing the generic convention that the bringer of justice is monk-like and undistracted. The intervening books outside the series were vacations from such publishing manners, and Dibdin certainly enjoyed them. The non-Zen novels are erotically inventive and explicit, making full use of the author&apos;s post-Chatterley freedom to map the erogenous zones. In The Tryst, a unsatisfyingly married psychiatrist becomes dangerously attracted to an adolescent patient. Dirty Tricks, a brutal comedy of bad behaviour, private and public, during the Thatcher era, begins with adulterous fellatio in the kitchen at a north Oxford dinner party and proceeds to sexual acts rarely described in mainstream fiction. Although Dibdin never formally employed a pseudonym, he seemed to do so psychologically, writing under two quite distinct identities. I have so far been fairly sparing with details of the action of End Games. This is partly, as in any discussion of a crime novel, for fear of spoiling the plot. But in Dibdin&apos;s case, there is also a sense, especially in the later Zen novels, that he slightly believed crime novels to be spoiled by the plot. End Games is typical of his late style in being a collage of seemingly unrelated scenes, played out in un-numbered, untitled chapters, the divisions signalled only by space at the base of a page. Readers will have to decide whether the three narrative strands - the kidnapping, the Revelation movie and a hunt for buried historical treasure - are ever satisfactorily connected, and whether this finally matters, given the intensity of the psychological and geographical detail Dibdin provides. The writer&apos;s increasing resistance to the twists and tension traditionally required by the genre may result from the fact that he came slightly reluctantly to the crime shelves. (In this respect, he parallels Ian Rankin, whose first Rebus novel began as a scholarly variation on Jekyll and Hyde in which, in the first draft, Rebus died.) The first two Dibdin novels to be published were erudite exercises in historical pastiche: The Last Sherlock Holmes Story (1978) sent Arthur Conan Doyle&apos;s sleuth on the trail of Jack the Ripper, while A Rich Full Death (1986) was a murder mystery set around the household in Florence of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Although critically praised, neither book achieved paperback publication or significant sales until the Zen books broke through; his readers may regret that Dibdin never returned to that strain of literary-historical fiction, except tangentially in the slight and somewhat bitter The Dying of the Light (1993), a parody of the classic English country house crime book, which has the feel of a lawyer&apos;s letter warning that critics and readers must never make the mistake of associating him with the genre of Agatha Christie. More than most mystery writers, Dibdin was angered by the extent to which prize committees and literary editors in Britain maintain a distinction between crime books and &quot;literature&quot;. As a Booker prize judge in 1992, I tried to make a case for Dibdin&apos;s Cabal, but it was dismissed by a don on the panel as &quot;a Vatican travelogue&quot;. End Games, though, completes a library that at least competes with the output of many writers who have been given cheques by literary committees. It would have been good to have more books, but this one serves as a culmination of what Michael Dibdin stood for, in writing and in life: place, language and the consolation that worldly pleasure can provide against darker intimations. To borrow from the ancient language of the nation in which his main fiction was set, and the religion of his troubled but finally decent detective: requiescat in pace. Michael Dibdin&apos;s End Games is published by Faber on July 5.

At least, that is the fear of many influential figures - from senior officials at finance ministries to politicians and independent economists. These experts are, generally speaking, pointing their fingers from West to East, from the US and Europe to China, Russia and the Gulf, and they are being specific about the threat. A new breed of global investment behemoths, the so-called &apos;sovereign wealth&apos; funds (SWFs) - effectively state-controlled investment funds bankrolled by huge foreign exchange surpluses or petrodollars - want to buy up, among other things, western companies. This could provoke protectionist calls from populist politicians. Last week, for example, the German government was reported to be setting up an agency to examine acquisitions by these investment colossi, concerned that they could pose a threat to national security, particularly if they bought a major bank. A day later, the IMF joined calls for greater scrutiny of what it calls &apos;black boxes&apos; through which increasing financial flows are funnelled. There are also questions about whether it is desirable for companies in the UK, say, to be owned by foreign governments whose commitment to capitalism and democracy may be shaky. A week ago, a US Treasury official, Clay Lowery, stated baldly that there was a risk that &apos;the size, investment policies, and/or operating methods of these funds fuel financial protectionism&apos;. The UK is concerned too - senior officials from the Treasury and the Foreign Office are meeting the head of China&apos;s fund to indicate that, while Britain is open for business, it would be nice to know a bit more about the fund&apos;s management and intentions. As these fears were pouring out, China announced that its state-run foreign exchange corporation would raise \u00a3200bn via a bond issue. Even before this capitalisation, China had been active on the international stage, buying a $3bn stake in private equity group Blackstone earlier this year, making investments in Africa and unveiling offers for US companies such as oil giant Unocal. Meanwhile, officials in Dubai, which operates a hyperactive global investment fund as part of the Maktoum family-controlled Dubai World group - which bought P&amp;O last year - indicated that it was prepared to collaborate with China on future projects and could get involved in asset swaps. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, says: &apos;It is possible that this could lead us down a protectionist route. We have already seen signs of how some countries respond. The problem is that there are few ground rules for how these funds operate.&apos; Lyons points to reaction in the US Congress to China&apos;s approach for Unocal and its demand that Dubai Ports World divest US ports on national security grounds as a condition for US clearance of its bid for P&amp;O. But he also points out that sovereign funds have been around a long time. For example, the Singapore Investment Corporation and Kuwait Investment Office have existed since the Eighties. So what has changed? The US view seems to be that things are getting serious because they are getting big. Lowery said: &apos;What is new is the number of sovereign wealth funds and their sheer current and projected sizes.&apos; The numbers are indeed dizzying. According to Morgan Stanley and figures quoted by Lowery, SWFs hold some 2.5 per cent of all the world&apos;s financial assets. In 10 years&apos; time, says Morgan Stanley, this could rise to 9 per cent. The reason is the swelling of foreign currency reserves and the increased appetite for risk since the effects of the financial crises in Russia and Asian countries in the late Nineties have receded into history. In the past five years, global foreign currency reserves have increased at a massive 20 per cent annually to stand at some $5.6 trillion. Much of the increase is accounted for by Asian countries building up reserves following the 1997-98 crisis. In the meantime, the high oil price has boosted foreign exchange earnings for Russia and the Middle East. With post-crisis safety in mind, the repository for much of these reserves has been government bonds, particularly US treasuries, of which China alone holds about $ 1trillion. Now, however, the limits of prudence have been reached, and countries in surplus are looking to target higher-risk, higher-return assets - such as western companies. Such is the weight of money behind these funds that analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that as SWFs grow toward controlling 9 per cent of global wealth in the next decade, global bond yields will rise some 30 basis points in response. In short, the world could become a riskier place as these major investors switch away from safe old government bonds. The fear is that risk will mean instability and that moving from holding debt to owning companies will make SWFs much more intrusive. The problem is that as things stand little is known about these bodies - from Dubai World to China&apos;s State Foreign Exchange Investment Corporation, to Russia&apos;s oil stabilisation funds. This only increases the risks that ownership by such bodies poses. Although China&apos;s bond issue gives a $200bn clue it is unclear if this is the extent of its finance, and similar queries exist over the scope of the other players. Meanwhile, such things as investment principles and management discipline are unknown. This, believes Lowery, could lead to protectionism. &apos;There will likely be much public attention to whether SWFs exercise the voting rights of their equity shares and if so how. If SWFs obtain operational control of the companies in which they invest, the fact that they are government entities may invite additional scrutiny.&apos; Lyons says: &apos;This is all evidence of a major change in the global economy.&apos; He points to the forecast growth in Asia over the next 13 years - by 2020, a third of global trade could be accounted for by Asia compared with a seventh for the US, with the need to create some 750 million jobs on the continent by then. His view is that it is vital to ensure a &apos;level playing field&apos; for trade throughout this period of change, rather than the current higgledy-piggledy relationships. &apos;The US and Germany do have a more protectionist feel about them today,&apos; he says. But this might be down to concerns over reciprocity: if China is able to buy companies in the US and Germany, and gain access to intellectual property, could it happen the other way around? It certainly looks more difficult. However, as Lyons argues: &apos;If China opens up its markets, the Germans might become less protectionist.&apos; He believes a multinational, multilateral approach is needed to establish ground rules governing the operation of state-controlled funds. The question is, which organisation to use. The IMF (or the World Bank) may not cut it in Beijing. Vincent Cable, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, says: &apos;The World Trade Organisation should pick it up. China is a member and should be compliant with any conclusions. And this would be a good example of the importance of having Russia as a member of the organisation.&apos; The difficulty is that there are reservations over Russia&apos;s membership - its conduct on trade and economic issues, particularly over &apos;resource nationalism&apos;, is seen as getting worse, not better. There clearly is a will for reciprocity. While Lowery has made his fears clear, another official said last week that the US welcomed investment and would like to see China channelling its dollar reserves back into the US. Whether the need for a share of investment from the new capitalist bloc overcomes the fear of economic takeover by former communist state-owned monoliths may well determine whether the world enters a new era of protectionism.

Now Bernie is no mug - you don&apos;t become as rich as he is without being very smart. Not least, he is perceptive at spotting new trends. He recognised the potential of TV broadcasting and its associated rights before virtually anyone else in Europe. And he was right about the growing importance of East Asia (though hardly the first to notice it). But Bernie always has an agenda, his own, and it is almost invariably about money, his own. When he suggested that F1 should move east, it was because he could see rich pickings. You may remember that when he gave a \u00a31m donation to the Labour Party in 1997, a government decision about a ban on tobacco advertising in sport happened to be imminent - and F1 was later exempted from it. Pure accident of timing, of course. Soon F1 was moving east. We had grands prix in Malaysia, Shanghai, Turkey and Bahrain, in addition to Japan. In the near future we are likely to have Singapore and New Delhi. To judge by the sparsely populated grandstands at many of these races, the incentive is certainly not the attendance figures. But in return for the privilege of holding a grand prix, these countries have paid exorbitant annual fees to Bernie&apos;s management company, as well as spending a fortune on building state-of-the-art facilities. There is no way that these operations are commercially viable. All the new circuits depend on a huge and continuing state subsidy. Governments have calculated that the global attention a grand prix attracts makes the outlay worthwhile. Bernie would love to persuade - or bully - European governments to do the same. He has been biting at the heels of Spa, in Belgium, and Imola, the Italian venue for the San Marino Grand Prix, and the latter appears to have disappeared off the calendar. As we head for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone next weekend, Bernie will no doubt remind us yet again of the desperate condition of the facilities and the need for a huge injection of cash. In May, he suggested for the first time that the British government should pay for improvements, mindful that it is difficult to imagine any private investor ever securing a commercial return. The underlying idea is this: the government should subsidise Bernie&apos;s company. Given his wealth and the riches that abound in F1, this solution should be resisted. If Bernie thinks - rightly - that Britain is the spiritual home of motorsport, alongside Italy, then this is something his company should take into account. Perhaps he should promote it - and also subsidise its future. To his credit, Ken Livingstone, attracted though he was to the idea of staging a British Grand Prix in London, drew back when he realised how much of London&apos;s money would need to be spent on Bernie&apos;s fees and making the capital race-ready. The Great Eastern Experiment seems to have encountered serious problems. The Singapore Grand Prix is scheduled to be held at night, a possibility being canvassed for the Malaysian and Australian races. One assumes that the reason is that the TV audiences in Europe in the middle of the night or early morning are too small to justify the fees being charged to broadcasters. Bernie may have dreamt that the future lay in the East, but the support-base remains firmly located in the home of the sport, Europe. It may be an exaggeration that the future of F1 will consist of well attended races in Europe, and fans there watching barely attended night races in the East on TV, but there could be more than a germ of truth in it. Not that it will worry Bernie, as long as the money keeps rolling in. After all, grand prix races are now almost devoid of overtaking and have, as a consequence, become boring, but while they continue to make loadsamoney for Bernie and Co, no one seems to mind. Is Silverstone&apos;s future safe? I think so. When Michael Schumacher was in his pomp, Germany was given two grands prix. Spain will have two races in future, such is the support for Fernando Alonso there. It is inconceivable that, with Lewis Hamilton now established as a new national hero, Britain will be deprived of its one grand prix a year. After all, it wouldn&apos;t make commercial sense. Second thoughts I was recently in a radio discussion about Lewis Hamilton when Luther Blissett, the black former Watford and England footballer, touchingly said that the younger man was his role model. Just what is it about Hamilton that appeals to so many? He is obviously a great driver, intelligent, articulate, presentable, enjoys a close and supportive relationship with his father, and is in a sport - Formula One - that has never before had a black driver, let alone a black superstar. In other words, he defies all the stereotypes held by white people about black men. Perhaps that is why so many people find him so intriguing and attractive."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/01/cricket.features2", "sentences": ["I watched the 2003 World Cup at the British High Commission in Singapore with Mick and the Stones&apos; drummer, Charlie Watts."], "publicationDate": "2007-06-30T23:06:27Z", "title": "Former prime minister John Major and the great England fast bowler Bob Willis in conversation", "tags": ["Sport", "Cricket"], "article": "Bob Willis: Why did you want to write a book about the early years of cricket? John Major In the established histories, there are some mistakes which I wanted to correct. For example, the suggestion that cricket began in France is a straightforward misread of the original document. While we knew a lot about what cricketers did on the pitch, we did not know much about how they fitted in with what was happening in the rest of the country at the time and the structure of society. BW: Who were your boyhood heroes? JM: My family moved to Brixton in the Fifties when Surrey won seven consecutive County Championships from 1951. There were the great names like Peter May, Alec Bedser, Tony Lock, Jim Laker, but also batsmen like Bernard Constable and David Fletcher, and Eric Bedser, who would have had a long England career if it hadn&apos;t been for Laker. BW: Is there too much international cricket played now? JM: There&apos;s too much one-day cricket, such as the trilateral tournaments before, during or at the end of a Test series. I understand how important they are financially, but, as we saw with this year&apos;s World Cup, you can have too much. That said, I&apos;m a big fan of Twenty20. I see 20,000 people pouring into The Oval after their day at the office, many with their children. If this is going to introduce them to cricket, I&apos;m all for it. BW: Who have been your favourite players? JM: In terms of bowling, it would have to be Shane Warne (left). He is a phenomenon. I once asked Peter May how he would play Warne and he said: &apos;I don&apos;t know.&apos; Of English batsmen, it would be Graham Gooch for his consistency. For enjoyment of watching him bat, David Gower. BW: And the great all-rounders? JM: I saw so much of Ian Botham that it&apos;s difficult to get past him. You never quite knew what was going to happen. He might take two or three wickets in an over, he might be hit around the ground; he might smash the ball over the boundary or he might be out trying to smash the ball over the boundary. BW: Does the &apos;spirit of cricket&apos; still exist? JM: The belief that things like match-fixing are new is hogwash. The marriages of cricket and gambling, and of cricket and alcohol have been there since the start. But although there is bad behaviour in cricket, it is practised only by a very small minority. Cricket exists a good deal beyond the Test level. The spirit of cricket at village level, where you see people playing even though they&apos;re absolutely useless, is a very attractive aspect of the game. BW: Why did you award Harold Larwood an MBE 60 years after the 1932-33 &apos;Bodyline&apos; tour? JM: Harold had been treated disgracefully by the cricket establishment. Because of the innate class distinctions that racked this country for so long, there were a lot of people, like him, who were at least as deserving of an honour as those who already had one. BW: I met Harold on my first tour of Australia in 1970-71. He lived in a fairly modest home in Sydney. To hear him talk about his captain Douglas Jardine and the ruthless preparation that went into that tour was fascinating. JM: I called him up one day when he was having a nap, but his daughter woke him up. Within a few seconds, he was reminiscing about Jack Hobbs batting against Australia in 1926. He obviously regarded Hobbs as the greatest batsman he had seen. Harold had every right to be bitter about the way he had been treated in England, but he never once spoke out about it. BW: Did you talk cricket with any of your fellow political leaders? JM: In Harare a few years back, Robert Mugabe told me that he thought cricket civilised people and he wanted Zimbabwe to be a nation of cricket-lovers. I tried explaining the game to George Bush Senior, but when I told him that it could last for five days and there might not be a positive result, I could see his eyes glaze over. I saw Bill Clinton in Moscow a few weeks ago and he asked for a copy of the book. BW: Any other interesting characters with whom you&apos;ve talked cricket? JM: I&apos;ve known Mick Jagger for almost 30 years and he&apos;s a huge cricket fan. When I travel overseas I quite often find myself in the same hotel as him. More often than not, he&apos;s taken the suite I wanted. I watched the 2003 World Cup at the British High Commission in Singapore with Mick and the Stones&apos; drummer, Charlie Watts. \u00b7 More Than a Game by John Major is published by Harper Sport"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/02/mondaymediasection.politicsandthearts", "sentences": ["It means treading quite a delicate line, which government has had to do for 20 years, between maintaining the strength of public service broadcasting but at the same time allowing commercial operators to spread their wings.&quot; Corridors of power One of the biggest victories for the DCMS (aside from the obvious one in Singapore) was carried out among the labyrinthine corridors of power in Brussels."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-02T09:25:32Z", "title": "Owen Gibson on the challenges facing new culture secretary James Purnell", "tags": ["Media", "Art", "Theatre", "Culture", "Politics", "James Purnell"], "article": "There is one organisation that Tessa Jowell probably will not be too sad to leave behind as she bids farewell to the DCMS offices just off Trafalgar Square in London and heads up the road to the Cabinet Office in her new role as Olympics supremo. Not the BBC, Sky or even the Daily Mail, but the august Royal Television Society, which has played host to some of the most pivotal - and embarrassing - moments of her tenure as culture secretary. It was at its biennial conference that she first displayed her shaky early grasp of her brief when, in September 2001, she stumbled and gaffed her way through a question and answer session. Two years later, she arrived three hours late to fire the starting gun towards digital switchover, as well as to begin the interminable post-Hutton review of the BBC that led to last year&apos;s licence fee settlement. In 2005, she made it on time to pledge it would happen before 2012 and be paid for out of the licence fee. And she recently chose an RTS event (for which again she was late) to tie up her broadcasting policy loose ends, including giving Channel 4 \u00a314m in licence fee support with one hand and delivering a stern warning over its future remit with the other. Her successor as culture secretary is certainly no stranger to the brief, having played a key role in many of the biggest broadcasting policy decisions of the past decade. Already well known to the broadcasting fraternity, 37-year-old James Purnell has become more visible to the general public in recent months as a regularly tipped &quot;rising star&quot; under the Brown administration, despite having close links to his predecessor. When he was acting as unpaid intern for Tony Blair during his university holidays, using an upturned bin for a desk, the quietly ambitious Purnell may even then have had half an eye on a cabinet post. Having successfully shifted his allegiance from Blair to Brown, he now has one. Purnell followed the familiar New Labour path from researcher (working alongside Ed Richards, among others) to thinktank (coming up with the blueprint for Ofcom while at the IPPR) to policy wonk (where he again worked alongside Richards, framing the 2003 Communications Act) to junior minister. He became an MP at 31 and during a spell as minister for the creative industries impressed many with his knowledge, and made friends by banging the drum for the music industry, fashion and gaming. What some consider arrogance is, insist friends, merely enthusiasm. Yet there could be some difficult exchanges when the boundaries between Jowell and Purnell overlap, particularly in areas like sport, tourism and arts spending. Meanwhile, all the major broadcasters are attempting to read the runes over what the switch from Blair to Brown will mean for them. At the BBC, they are trying to determine whether the Treasury&apos;s hardline approach to the licence fee negotiations was that of a prudent chancellor or of a future prime minister who still feels the BBC is bloated and inefficient. All will be reconfiguring their lobbying operations to deal with the regime change. Whitehall insiders say the dividing lines between Purnell and Jowell have yet to be properly established, with at least 70 staff remaining within the DCMS but reporting to the new Olympics minister, because the decision was taken so late. But they also point to their close working relationship when she was his boss. Across the media industry the verdict on Jowell&apos;s tenure is mixed, but broadly positive, and on a personal level she was well liked. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at Westminster University, sums up the consensus view. &quot;I think she&apos;s been generally good news. She followed the template laid down by Chris Smith, which is essentially pro-public service and the BBC but also pro-competition. It means treading quite a delicate line, which government has had to do for 20 years, between maintaining the strength of public service broadcasting but at the same time allowing commercial operators to spread their wings.&quot; Corridors of power One of the biggest victories for the DCMS (aside from the obvious one in Singapore) was carried out among the labyrinthine corridors of power in Brussels. Despite starting with only Slovakia onside, the success of DCMS wonks (with Ofcom backing) in persuading the EC to dilute plans to force individual states to regulate internet content, has huge implications for the future of media regulation. Similarly, Jowell&apos;s constant efforts to promote media literacy may come to be seen as one of her most significant achievements. Digital switchover, potentially such a minefield, appears well on course in technical and financial terms although it will require close attention to ensure the election year nightmare of blank television screens does not come to pass. She has also bequeathed Purnell the fallout from Ofcom&apos;s decision over the digital dividend. But Jowell has left a clear direction of travel for her successor to follow. Indeed, with the BBC licence fee set and a determination to preserve the principle of public service plurality in the digital age established, it could be argued that in the short term she has left Purnell with little to do. Some take a more critical view of Jowell&apos;s unusually long stint in the same ministerial office, arguing that she fudged the major issues and failed to back up her words with action. Greg Dyke, the former BBC director general whose explosive clash with the government provided the most dramatic media moment of Jowell&apos;s tenure, is firmly in that camp. &quot;In the end, the disappointing thing was that she didn&apos;t deliver for the BBC. They didn&apos;t get anything like the licence fee settlement they wanted or, more to the point, needed. &quot; Of course, Dyke&apos;s view is not altogether surprising given that their personality clash emerged as one of the reasons why the BBC governors forced him out. Also in the debit column, some argue that she was so consensual in style that it took an age to get anything done and despite repeated promises to lift the sense of continual review hanging over the BBC and public service broadcasting in general, there seems little hope of that. In the past year, as planning for the Olympics has reached a more controversial and intense stage, broadcasting appears to have dropped off the agenda. In the final analysis, most believe Jowell was an instinctive friend of the BBC and without her, there is little doubt the Treasury would have turned the screw even tighter on the corporation&apos;s finances. She also repeatedly advocated plurality in public service broadcasting but recoiled at some of C4&apos;s recent programming excesses - on a day of high drama in Oxford, she denounced Celebrity Big Brother as &quot;disgusting&quot; and &quot;racism as entertainment&quot; on the same day that chief executive Andy Duncan was making a hash of defending it. It seems certain that Purnell will take a similar line, although his view of the BBC is more difficult to divine. Some have simplistically assumed that, because he once worked there as head of corporate planning under John Birt, he will be sympathetic. The truth, as anyone who has followed the internecine power struggles of the corporation down the years will note, is more complex. Just as Birt himself turned against the BBC once outside its walls, supporting the case for top-slicing much to Jowell&apos;s consternation, Purnell was known to be extremely hawkish during the Gilligan affair. Indeed, he later caused a minor furore by auctioning off a copy of the Hutton report signed by Alastair Campbell and Cherie Blair for charity. His relationship with Ofcom, where he will again cross paths with Richards, will also be interesting. There are those who are quietly wondering whether Ofcom is assuming the mantle of policy maker rather than regulator, and whether the government should not lend a steadying hand. Though, having established an independent converged regulator, it is of course difficult to be seen to be influencing it. As far as newspapers are concerned, there is little appetite to re-examine the case for statutory regulation. When Blair delivered his &quot;feral beasts&quot; speech, which contained a muddled shot across the bows on newspaper regulation, Brown&apos;s aides were quick to dampen speculation that it would translate into anything harder. If anything, the trend is likely to continue to be towards more hands-off regulation as convergence accelerates. In public, Jowell was always supportive of the press although in private she was a little more forthright given her experiences over that pesky business with her husband, her mortgage and Silvio Berlusconi. Jowell managed to get through her tenure without a major media ownership battle crossing her desk; Purnell is unlikely to be so lucky. He will perhaps be relieved that the big media question facing the government in the coming months - whether it has the appetite to take on Rupert Murdoch ahead of a looming general election - is one for John Hutton and his new department for business, enterprise and regulatory reform and, more pertinently, Brown himself. Indeed, despite the framework being well established, big structural questions remain for Jowell&apos;s successor. Her RTS speech contained a heavy hint that hiving off the licence fee directly to producers or to fund Ofcom&apos;s Public Service Publisher wheeze was a live possibility at the end of the current six-year deal. The decision of the BBC&apos;s web 2.0 guru Tom Loosemore to quit to head up Ofcom&apos;s PSP plans was a further indication that the idea is being taken extremely seriously. The public service broadcasting construct that has served Britain so well for 50 years is rapidly breaking down, and it could well be on Purnell&apos;s watch that the significant decisions about its future have to be taken."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/02/1", "sentences": ["Top 20 most prosperous countries Norway United States Sweden Austria New Zealand Canada Denmark Germany Finland Switzerland Australia Singapore Netherlands Ireland Iceland Mexico Israel United Kingdom Belgium Spain"], "publicationDate": "2007-07-02T16:23:39Z", "title": "UK lags behind in prosperity league", "tags": ["Money"], "article": "The UK has come low down on a list of the most prosperous countries in the world to live in, failing even to make it into the top 15.

Following a number of contamination scandals in the US, the world&apos;s biggest exporter is struggling to prove that it can match quality with quantity. In the first half of 2007, 19.1% of products made for domestic consumption were found to be substandard, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on Tuesday. Among products made by small firms, the failure rate was nearly 30%. &quot;These are not isolated cases,&quot; Han Yi, director of the administration&apos;s quality control and inspection department, told the state media. Underlining his concerns, officials said hundreds of bottles of fake human blood protein were found in hospitals and excessive amounts of additives and preservatives were detected in children&apos;s snacks. The trust deficit is enormous and growing. Shi Ying, 50, a businesswoman, said she was so concerned about food safety that she found it difficult to shop. &quot;I dare not eat farmed fish or meat because most are fed with growth pills or pumped with bad additives. I worry about vegetables in case they are tainted with pesticide. I even think twice about the water I drink because it might contain heavy metals.&quot; Although Ms Shi lives in Shenzhen, one of China&apos;s most-advanced cities, she has started to grow her own vegetables, eat less meat and drink water only from respected bottled brands or the family well. When she does have to shop, she puts safety above patriotism. &quot;I think foreign food is less risky. Even though they are not as fresh, I trust products from the US, Europe and Japan because those countries protect their environments. Sometimes when I see foreigners blithely eating raw lettuce in Chinese restaurants, I worry for them.&quot; While the worst violations are in the domestic market, the repercussions are felt beyond the country&apos;s borders. China fills the shelves of Wal-Mart, Tesco and Sainsbury&apos;s with low-price products. But as its world presence has grown, so have concerns about safety. First, there was a mysterious spate of cat and dog deaths in the US this year that was later attributed to tainted pet food from China. Next, in the US and UK, came the recall of more than 1m Thomas &amp; Friends toy trains coated with poisonous lead paint from China. Then, independence day fireworks were withdrawn in the US because of their dangerously unpredictable sense of direction. Most of these scandals occurred in the US, where food safety is fast becoming a front in the trade war between the world&apos;s biggest consumer and producer. &quot;I think we have reached a point unfortunately where Made in China is now a warning label in the United States,&quot; said a Democratic senator, Richard Durbin, recently. The issue also topped the agenda of recent talks between the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, and the Chinese vice-premier, Wu Yi. Other countries have also expressed concern. Last year Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner, said that European customs officers had seized fake birth control pills and HIV drugs from China. According to Mr Mandelson, half the counterfeit goods found in the EU originate in China. Japan has also called for higher safety standards, and Singapore, Australia, Panama and the Dominican Republic have recalled millions of tubes of Chinese-made toothpaste that allegedly contained dangerous levels of diethylene glycol, a toxin. It remains unclear whether this represents a surge in the number of unsafe goods or simply wider coverage at a time of rising trade friction. But the threat to China&apos;s business is growing. In an attempt to quell concerns, the government said yesterday it was drawing up new safety rules for oral care products. Beijing has also promised to revise its inspection system for other products. Last month, the government published its first five-year plan for improving food and drug safety. It closed 180 food factories in the first half of this year and seized tonnes of sweets, pickles, crackers and seafood tainted with formaldehyde, illegal dyes and industrial wax. But the government also stands accused of reacting slowly to scandal rather than dealing with the root causes: a lack of trust in the safety standards of a country with a profit-first economic policy and a secretive, unaccountable political system. Public confidence has not been helped by an official response that includes denial and scapegoating. &quot;I think it would be better if the media would stop playing up this issue,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said this week. Last month, the former head of China&apos;s food and drug agency, Zheng Xiaoyu, was sentenced to death for accepting 6.5m yuan (\u00a3425,000) in bribes from pharmaceutical companies to expedite the approval of new drugs. Media reassurances are unconvincing. &quot;More than 80% of China&apos;s products are up to standard,&quot; the Business Daily said yesterday. It was not meant ironically. This was a gain on the previous year. Along with health and the environment, consumer safety has been one of the biggest victims of the rush to get rich. The domestic market has probably been affected more than international trade because export standards are higher than for goods sold in China. Last month, food inspectors said paraffin wax, dyes, formaldehyde and cancer-causing compounds were detected in food produced by unlicensed and small producers. There have also been scandals related to fake or poorly made drugs. Last summer, 11 people were killed by antibiotics that contained diethylene glycol, an industrial toxin. In 2005, two boys in Guangdong province died from rabies after receiving bogus vaccinations. A year before, at least 50 babies in Anhui province died and more than 100 were malnourished after being fed fake milk formula, some of which had only 6% of the vitamins, minerals and protein needed for a growing infant."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/05/thefiver.sport", "sentences": ["In Singapore, you can get a $1,000 fine for chewing gum in public."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-05T15:54:41Z", "title": "Nick Nack-A-Like Carlos Tevez", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Carlos Tevez"], "article": "BOOTY CALLS Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Victorians might have been good at relieving themselves over scandalously exposed table legs, but their puritanical legacy stinks like Queen Victoria after a five-day coke binge.

And with Louis Saha out injured and the Emmerdale Eminem rumoured to be about to hip-hop off to Newcastle, the GlazerDome may start to resemble a late-Henry era Emirates. Then there&apos;s the selection problems - if you take a shipload of attacking players and try to squeeze them into a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 formation someone&apos;s going to be left out.

Negotiations between the BBC and the Augusta National remain at a sensitive stage but it is thought a deal will be tied up before the golfing circus arrives at Carnoustie for the Open later this month. Should the deal be completed it will represent a blow to Sky&apos;s hopes of shoring up its clout in the sport, a reputation that took a knock when Setanta snatched the rights to the USPGA Tour earlier this year. Sky has been courting the Masters for some years and the interest has helped the Augusta National drive an increasingly hard bargain with the BBC. The contract length has come down from five years to three and then to a one-year deal that leaves the two sides in an almost constant process of negotiation. For the BBC the deal would be a fillip after the loss in football of the England and FA Cup rights, and vindication for the enthusiasm shown by senior executives. Both the BBC&apos;s director-general Mark Thompson and its head of sport Roger Mosey flew to Augusta prior to this year&apos;s tournament to meet with the notoriously conservative members and reassure them of their commitment to the tournament. Murray&apos;s double fault Given Andy Murray&apos;s enthusiasm for the United States it seems odd that the Scot&apos;s management team should have turned down an interview opportunity with the country&apos;s most influential sports magazine.

After a correspondent had flown in from the US Apey pulled the plug, telling the magazine that his client &quot;was not ready for the publicity&quot;. A few weeks later, on the weekend SI was due to publish its piece, an exclusive interview with Murray appeared in a British newspaper&apos;s Saturday magazine. Sports Illustrated had to make do with quotes from a round-table meeting with a number of news outlets. Homer ambush fails A marketing stunt intended to publicise the forthcoming Simpsons movie foundered at Wimbledon yesterday when security guards were ordered to confiscate A4 cards featuring Homer Simpson that were handed to spectators at the gates.

Fun and the Games Wimbledon will provide the venue for the tennis tournament at London 2012 and the All England Club already boasts impeccable ties with the organising committee. Debbie Jeavons, the director of sport at London 2012, is a member at the club and sits on the Championship committee that is credited with dragging the tournament towards the 21st century. She is also an occasional tennis partner of the BBC presenter John Inverdale, which may explain why his enthusiasm for this year&apos;s damp squib remains undimmed. Putin scores for Sochi Sochi&apos;s victory in the race for the 2014 Winter Olympics has confirmed some of the trends evident in London&apos;s successful bid for 2012. The Russian resort triumphed in part because of the massive marketing budget provided by the state and supportive oligarchs, but the influence of Vladimir Putin, pictured below, who put his reputation on the line by travelling to the decisive vote at the IOC session in Guatemala City, should not be underestimated. Following Tony Blair&apos;s decisive contribution on London&apos;s behalf in Singapore in 2005, it seems that without overt support from a head of state or most senior political leader, cities have little chance of success. The result also confirms the IOC membership&apos;s lack of sentimentality when it comes to rejecting multiple bidders.

According to one industry expert, the airlines are deliberately making the job harder for longer-serving crew in the hope they will quit and make room for fresher, cheaper staff. &quot;Thousands of flight attendants have left their jobs since the 9/11 terror attacks because of layoffs, pay cuts and the emotional toll of a high-stress job,&quot; claims sociologist Drew Whitelegg in a new book. &quot;Their replacements earn much less, have less job security and face working conditions that make it difficult to balance work and family obligations,&quot; explains Whitelegg in Working the Skies (New York University Press). &quot;Basically the airlines are trying to get back to the pre-unionised days when women were hired on youth and looks, and inexperience meant wages were low,&quot; she says. &quot;Just look at the job profiles of cabin crew for Ryanair and easyJet - becoming a stewardess is like taking a gap year. &apos;Go wild, and travel while you are young for a few months&apos; is the message.&quot; Older cabin crew, such as the 85-year-old Iris Peterson who retired from United Airlines last month, will not be happy about the return to old values. But with airline bankruptcies and security uncertainties, the job may lose its hard-earned professional status if the bosses get their way. The tactic of hiring pretty, easily fired young things proved popular with the mostly male travellers of the post-war years when male stewards were replaced by &quot;sky girls&quot;, who then made way for the &quot;air hostess&quot;, who appeared to promise more than service with a smile. In 1950s north America, where commercial flights really took off, these air hostesses were, says Whitelegg, &quot;mostly farmers&apos; daughters and, of course, white. Then in 60s came the era now known as &apos;coffee, tea, or me?&apos;. &quot;This suggestion of sexual [appeal], played down now by airlines, and utterly revoked by the equal rights campaigns, still endures. It&apos;s just much more subtle these days. Virgin cabin crew, for example, are supposed to have &apos;Virgin flair&apos; because you can&apos;t, these days, say your flight attendants are more sexy - but it amounts to the same thing.&quot; In Asia, where airlines seem to have fewer scruples about this connotation - and where arguably women find it harder to secure equal rights - the &quot;air hostess&quot; has never really gone away. Singapore Airlines, for one, still emphasises the allure and youth of its female crew. While, in the west, older cabin crew are &quot;high-profile, elder-woman role models&quot; as Whitelegg puts it, in Asia the job is still perceived as glamorous and escapist. As one of the few half-decent jobs available for educated, middle-class women that doesn&apos;t mean being chained to a desk, the job of air hostess still has cachet in Japan. So sought-after are these posts that often only the most accomplished graduates - in Japan you need a degree to be a flight attendant - get past the first interview. &quot;In the Pacific Rim you see all the old practices living on and that indicates to me that such practices will come back here again,&quot; says Whitelegg. Airlines are using all kinds of tactics to encourage older staff to leave, says Whitelegg. &quot;Uniform redesigns emphasise a sexy figure, which many older women don&apos;t feel comfortable in.&quot; The industry is also stripping away incentives for seniority. &quot;Flying hours have been increased, which can be absolutely knackering as you get older,&quot; adds Whitelegg. The answer, says Whitelegg, is for crew to reassert their status as safety experts, something that briefly made an impression on flyers after cabin crew heroics during the events of 9/11. Since those attacks, cabin crew are now also expected, on top of their other duties, to save passengers from an increasing number of drunks and would-be killers boarding our planes. &quot;As flight attendants carry out their new security roles, they are still expected to perform their original duties,&quot; says airline cabin procedures expert and former flight attendant Diana Fairechild. &quot;Imagine asking marines patrolling enemy territory to simultaneously operate a refreshment stand, being sure to put forth a winning smile. &apos;Would you like a pillow? Oh, excuse me, I have to wrestle a knife away from the passenger in 24A.&apos;&quot; How the airline industry has changed The passengers Then: Mostly male; tycoons, internationalists, men of breeding; impeccably groomed. Good marriage prospects. Now: Known as the &quot;hairy armpit brigade&quot;. Some drunk, abusive, violent; all the sartorial sense of students in the bar. Lifestyle Then: Long stayovers at fine hotels, spending money, taxis everywhere, time to burn in gorgeous locations. Now: Digs in Crawley. Sleep in uniform before working return leg of intercontinental flight. Always jetlagged. Pay and conditions Then: Short-term contracts, sacked if pregnant, married, overweight or over the hill. Cheap flights. Now: &quot;Structured to reflect ongoing efforts to restore company to good financial health,&quot; says one airline PR. The crew Then: Sociable youngsters keen to see the world and maybe marry one of the men flying around it. Shorter hems. Now: Older, wiser, highly trained professionals with families to feed.

The 22-year-old comes to his home grand prix determined to display the same dominant form that earned him a decisive victory in the GP2 race that supported last year&apos;s round of the world championship, a success that dramatically endorsed his candidature for promotion. But Hamilton knows only too well that tackling Silverstone at the wheel of a 740 horsepower formula one car - rather than a 600 horsepower GP2 Dallara - will be a particularly exacting business, with the blustery crosswinds and the wide variety of corners that abound at this one-time RAF base. There is also the strong likelihood of his McLaren being overwhelmed on the 3.2-mile track by the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa after they dominated last Sunday&apos;s French grand prix in which Hamilton finished third. By the end of yesterday&apos;s second 90-minute practice session, Raikkonen and Massa had established themselves at the top of the timing sheets in first and second positions, emphasising that their excellent form in testing last month at the Northamptonshire circuit was no flash in the pan. Yet Hamilton, who after a blustery session finished the session fourth behind Ralf Schumacher&apos;s Toyota and two places ahead of his McLaren-Mercedes team-mate Fernando Alonso, still felt guardedly confident that he will be competitive in today&apos;s qualifying battle. &quot;The weekend last year with GP2 was something I will never forget,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;The response from the crowd was like nothing I had ever experienced and I just couldn&apos;t wait to get back on to the track. Silverstone is very different to Magny-Cours due to all the high-speed corners. It still needs a set-up compromise to make sure we have high-speed stability for the first section and grip to the latter part through the slower corners, such as Priory and Brooklands. To win at this race would be immense, but we have to be realistic about our expectations.&quot; Alonso, who goes into the race trailing his team-mate by 14 points, believes this could be the race in which the championship initiative begins to swing back in his favour at the circuit where he won 12 months ago for Renault. &quot;That race was very competitive and tough, but that&apos;s always the way with Silverstone,&quot; said the world champion. &quot;Because of all the speed, the car needs to have a good handling balance, and the track is quite bumpy in places.&quot; Jenson Button sat out the session after a repetition of the back problem that was caused by his first-corner collision in the US grand prix at Indianapolis, while David Coulthard posted the 14th fastest time to celebrate the renewal of his Red Bull contract for 2008. Meanwhile, it would not be British grand prix time without Bernie Ecclestone warning the owners of Silverstone that they will lose their race after 2009 unless the circuit is suitably upgraded for the future. Silverstone&apos;s contract runs out the year after next and the commercial rights holder is demanding improvements to the pits and paddock before any contract extension will be granted. With the introduction next year of Valencia and Singapore as grands prix venues and other races, including Abu Dhabi in 2009, to become part of the calendar, Silverstone is under pressure to act on Ecclestone&apos;s requirements. When asked what would happen if Silverstone&apos;s owners, the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, failed to upgrade the circuit to his satisfaction, Ecclestone replied crisply: &quot;We won&apos;t be here. They know, they&apos;ve known for five or six years, exactly what we want.&quot; How they stand Hamilton 64 Alonso 50 Massa 47 Raikkonen 42"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/jul/07/weekend7.weekend3", "sentences": ["Linda Soo-Tan, 40, from Singapore I always prefer to come to the UK in the cooler months.", "The British Museum is very famous in Singapore.", "People in Singapore tell you, &apos;You must visit the British Museum - they have 1,001 things.", "Simon Teo, eight, from Singapore  We were here yesterday: I saw the planes and the room about medicine, but we didn&apos;t spend enough time, so I asked to come back today."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T10:04:30Z", "title": "Over here: what do tourists really think of Britain?", "tags": ["Life and style", "Blackpool"], "article": "British Museum Joanne and Steve Crawford, both 62, from US Joanne Since I retired, I&apos;ve become interested in Bible history.

There&apos;s nothing comparable back in Sacramento. We&apos;ve got Sutter&apos;s Fort - where they discovered gold - but our history is nothing compared with European history. For us, 150 years ago is, &apos;Wow.&apos; Now we&apos;re talking about things that are a couple of thousand years old - things from Mesopotamia to do with Nimrod. I mean, those are really old things. And the Portland vase was neat, too. Attilia, 68, Enrica, 39, Giuseppe, 78, and Valentina Bellia, 37, from Italy Enrica There is such a big difference between the way we see art and history in Italy, and the way you see it here. In Rome, we just have to walk through the city and we see it. Whereas here you have everything organised very neatly. Linda Soo-Tan, 40, from Singapore I always prefer to come to the UK in the cooler months. I like it when it&apos;s cloudy and I can wear my jacket. The British Museum is very famous in Singapore. We read about it at school, and studied it in English lessons. It&apos;s the place you must see. People in Singapore tell you, &apos;You must visit the British Museum - they have 1,001 things. Blackpool Nicholas Thompson, 39, owner, Blackpool Pleasure Beach The Pleasure Beach has been in the family for years. It was my great grandfather - a Mr Bean, believe it or not - who set it up back in 1896. He visited the States and bought a ride called the Hotchkiss Patent Bicycle Railway. He tried to set up the Pleasure Beach on the south coast first, but it was a flop, so he came up to Blackpool and success grew and grew. I&apos;ve spent my whole life in the park. I&apos;d come here as a kid, and then as a teenager for my summer jobs. I learned how to make popcorn and candyfloss, and how to weld, so I could mend the rides. It&apos;s like a mini city here - everything&apos;s self-contained. We&apos;ve got our own plumbers, welders, joiners, wardrobe department. We&apos;ve even got a park vicar - when you&apos;ve got 2,000 employees from all over the world, there are going to be sad times as well as happy ones, so it&apos;s good to have someone to talk to. I&apos;d say I&apos;ve got the best job in the world - I basically sell smiles for a living. I may have a mountain of paperwork on my desk today, but I&apos;ve still been out making popcorn, and I rode on Infusion first thing to check it was OK. I go on the rides all the time - there&apos;s nothing like adrenaline to wake you up before work. Ben Smith, 33, Mark Beasley, 34, Damien Jackson, 28, Simon Jackson, 32, Rob Green, 24, Neil Beasley, 31. Kneeling: Tom Boote, 22, and Will Redgrave, 38, from Torquay Ben We&apos;re here on a stag do for Damien. We&apos;re pirates, and he&apos;s Peter Pan. Last night, we dressed him up as Pamela Anderson. The ladies loved it. We&apos;ve come from sunny Torquay, and this is our second day in Blackpool. It&apos;s one of the best places I&apos;ve been to - there&apos;s more fish and chip shops than you can ever imagine. We started drinking at one this morning. If it&apos;s got alcohol in it, we&apos;ll drink it. We&apos;ve had a few casualties already: some of the lads rocked in about 4.30 this morning, but we&apos;re on the go again. We are pirates, after all. Tahir Zia, 28, from Manchester I&apos;m in a suit, because I&apos;ve just finished work. I&apos;ve had some fries and candyfloss from a kiosk. It&apos;s not healthy, but no one&apos;s looking. Winnie, 21, and Catherine Wang, 20, from China Winnie We came here today because it&apos;s Children&apos;s Day back in China. It&apos;s a national holiday to celebrate the children finishing their exams. This year, we&apos;re celebrating it in Blackpool. The guys we&apos;re with won us these sharks on a basketball game. Ranijan, 60, and Surendra V Mehta, 66, from Manchester, with Samjoo D Sheth, 69, Suvidh, 59, and Neela Samghui, 53, from India Suvidh We arrived three days ago from Mumbai. This is our first visit to the UK, so we&apos;re very excited. First impressions are good: the people are very disciplined and decently dressed. In the US, where we&apos;ve just been, most people were in hot pants. We also felt quite lonely there, because there were so few Gujarati Indians. Here in the UK, I have plenty of relatives. I feel like I&apos;m at home. Kyle, 11, Angel, six months, Gloria, 46, Chloe, six, Alana, 19, Ben, eight, and Chanel Tyldesley, 16 (with boyfriend Bernard Richardson, 18), from Blackpool Gloria We&apos;ve just come for the day to enjoy the sun - but the price is a bit high. It&apos;s \u00a315 for a wristband at the Pleasure Beach, and when the season starts properly it&apos;s about \u00a330. It gets quite dear when there&apos;s a few of you. I have to wait till I get enough money saved. Tayla Meyer, 13, Chantel Marais, 16, Sylise Marais, 13, and Sue-Ellen Uermaak, 12, from South Africa Tayla I&apos;m the South African champion for under-15 freestyle couples dancing. It&apos;s the World Championships in Blackpool, and we&apos;ll be dancing from eight in the morning right into the night on Saturday and Sunday. I thought Blackpool would be for old people. I didn&apos;t think there&apos;d be entertainment and roller coasters. I got a nice surprise. Madame Tussauds  Maricha Martinez Ibana and Anabelle Sorcia Martinez , both 28, from Mexico  Anabelle The best thing about Madame Tussauds? When I saw Tom Cruise. I&apos;m a big fan - ever since Top Gun. I was, like, 12 and I fell in love with him. He&apos;s really handsome. Katie Holmes is so lucky. When I saw the figure, I thought, &apos;I want to bring him back to Mexico.&apos; Really. I want to cut him into pieces, put them in my bag and go. I took three pictures with him, maybe more. I got all the angles. You don&apos;t know how much I love him. My favourite angle was when I was really close, with my face next to his. And Prince William&apos;s not that bad, either. Brighton So Hee Hwang, 14, from South Korea I&apos;m from Seoul, but live near Beijing. I study at the International School, and 33 of us are on a school trip to the UK. Even though it&apos;s cold, we&apos;re going down to the beach to swim later. We&apos;ve already visited the London Eye and Buckingham Palace. We saw the Queen: it was her birthday and we saw her waving. We have no monarchy in Korea so it was great. Heike, 47, and Detlef Junger, 42, from Germany Detlef We&apos;ve come to discover the south coast. We saw an advert for it on TV, and thought, &apos;We must see if it is as nice as it looks.&apos; The guidebook said one of the most famous things was Brighton Pier. When we go back, our friends will ask, &apos;Did you see it?&apos; and it&apos;s not good if we say no. Science Museum  Ron Benigo, 68, and Dave Turner, 64, from US Ron We just returned from a cruise of the Baltic countries and we&apos;re spending a day in London before returning home to Las Vegas. We&apos;re just here for two nights and we&apos;re going to the theatre tonight, to see The Drowsy Chaperone. We&apos;re going to go meet our wives for dinner later. They&apos;ve gone to Harrods and Marks &amp; Spencer. Simon Teo, eight, from Singapore  We were here yesterday: I saw the planes and the room about medicine, but we didn&apos;t spend enough time, so I asked to come back today. I&apos;d like to study science and become an inventor when I&apos;m older. Stephanie Engohund, 28, from London I&apos;m here with a group of 24. We&apos;ve just finished our PGCE programme in secondary education - I&apos;ve trained to be a chemistry teacher. We felt we should come to the Science Museum, as teachers for the first time, to have a look around, so we can bring children here. We went to see a show - Flame, Bang, Wallop - about explosives. It&apos;d be ideal for Key Stage 3 children. I have been here before, about five years ago, but I won&apos;t say I really enjoyed it. But now I&apos;m looking at it through the eyes of a child. Xavi Calafell, 19, and Nadal Torres, 20, from Spain Xavi We&apos;re staying at the same hostel in Piccadilly. We&apos;re waiting till we get some work, visiting museums in the meantime. London is massive - it&apos;s too much. You can go where you want on the underground - you can do miles in minutes - but it&apos;s still too much choice. There&apos;s too many people and it&apos;s too expensive. Even meeting a friend takes so much time - he tells you to go to this stop, turn right, turn left, but it&apos;s impossible to find him. National Gallery, London Nechemia, 67, and Rachel Stern, 63, from Israel Nechemia I have come to London for the first time in 40 years - I studied here for my accountancy exams, but I have never been back. I have never been here with my wife, so we have been looking at places I remember. When I was a child, my parents showed me pictures from the National Gallery, and when I came 40 years ago I was surprised. In real life, the paintings were so much nicer. I planned our trip about half a year ago, and went to find out the times of opening, transport, everything, all on the internet. We have a printed itinerary of where else we want to go: Tower Bridge, Museum of London, Bank of England, Tate Modern, V&amp;A, Science Museum, Kensington Palace, British Museum, the Guildhall. We&apos;ll get through it all - we have a plan for every day. A lot has changed. Chinatown wasn&apos;t here 40 years ago. There seem to be many more foreign citizens. When you think of England, you think of a man in a bowler hat. In our office in London, everyone wore bowler hats and dark suits - we looked very official. I&apos;ve also found, revisiting places, that I remembered things differently. For instance, Oxford Street: I remember it as big, but we went this afternoon and it&apos;s very narrow - only two buses can pass each other at a time. I had an impression it was much bigger and wider. Jing Qian, Wei Zhang and Hang Wei, all 20, from China Hang Wei We&apos;re mainly here because our girlfriends have gone shopping. We wanted to see Van Gogh&apos;s Sunflowers, but we couldn&apos;t find it - only this one from the gift shop. London Eye Hannah and Rachel Webster, both four, from Edinburgh Hannah Eating my lunch was the best bit today. I like the big Ferris wheel because it goes round and round and round. Rachel I like the Ferris wheel because it&apos;s so funny. Hannah And you know what else I did? I went on my holidays and I got a surprise. I got a surprise that I love going on the Ferris wheel. Rachel That&apos;s not a surprise! Rebecca and Marc Fagan, both 25, from Australia Bec I had the idea for this trip about 18 months ago and we&apos;ve been planning ever since. Then I got pregnant. That wasn&apos;t planned. London&apos;s quite popular with young people in Australia. We get The Bill on TV, but no one watches it. Little Britain and The Vicar Of Dibley are good, though. We went to Fifteen last night. We didn&apos;t eat there, just took a photo. We get a lot of Jamie on telly in Australia, and there&apos;s a Fifteen in Melbourne, so we wanted to check out the real deal. Marc The one thing I was dreading about the UK was the warm beer. The Aussies always go on about warm beer over here, and, oh God yeah, it&apos;s been terrible. I had one yesterday in some pub near Turnham Green. I got a pint of London Pride. Apparently it&apos;s supposed to be warm and flat, but that&apos;s blasphemous in Australia. You&apos;ve always got to have your beer icy-cold. Joe, 62, and Jadzia Lordeon, 57, from US Joe We were actually on our way from D\u00fcsseldorf to Croatia, but we decided to come see London for four days. Our plan is to have no plan - we just let life come along. We were keen to come and see this lovely venue, the Eye, as it&apos;s known around the world. It&apos;s a real engineering marvel and celebration of life. Jadzia My father served in the Polish air force under the King of England during world war two, which is how he met my mum. She&apos;d just spent a lovely five years doing slave labour at a textile factory in Germany. They got married and lived in England for five years before moving to Argentina. My sister was born in Kent. This is my first tourist experience in the UK. Everything&apos;s gone smoothly, except the hotel. We arrived straight from the plane at about five yesterday evening and asked to see the room. It seemed fine, but a train hadn&apos;t been by yet: it was as if the tracks ran through our room. We left two hours later. Derwent Valley reservoirs, Peak District  Pauline Walmsley, 41, from Stockport Sometimes you&apos;ll go somewhere and it feels like you&apos;re not really wanted, but people are interested in the bikes here. You let kids sit on them, but you have to watch out for the hot parts - a hot exhaust will take the skin off bare legs. We&apos;re in a bikers&apos; club called Hatters Chapter - we&apos;ve got badges embroidered on our leathers and everything. We go all over. Up to the Lakes and back, or to Ponderosa. Today, there are six bikes. Two of us have army backgrounds, so the historic bit of the lake and the dams appeal to them. Last week they went to the battlefields in Normandy - I&apos;ve done that before with my husband. The year before that, we did the Somme."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/08/barbaramcmahon.theobserver", "sentences": ["After a route that took them over the Caribbean, South America, Africa, Arabia, India, Burma, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia they stopped in Lae, New Guinea."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T23:04:43Z", "title": "Island hunt to solve the riddle of Amelia Earhart", "tags": ["World news", "Amelia Earhart"], "article": "A team of investigators is heading to one of the most remote islands in the Pacific next week to resolve a 70-year-old mystery: what happened to Amelia Earhart, the world&apos;s most famous woman aviator. The glamorous adventurer, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, disappeared along with navigator Fred Noonan while attempting to circumnavigate the globe. It was always assumed their aircraft crashed in the sea and sank, but now an expedition by members of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, or Tighar, hopes to prove that one or both of the fliers survived. The organisation has found circumstantial evidence Earhart may have spent the last days of her life as a castaway on Nikumaroro, one of the Polynesian Kiribati islands, northeast of Australia. A team of 15 will carry out archaeological searches at a campsite where human remains and a woman&apos;s shoe were found in 1940. &apos;We hope to find some bones on the island and use DNA tests to prove they belonged to Amelia or her navigator by comparing it with DNA from their living relatives,&apos; said American expedition leader Ric Gillespie. Earhart and Noonan set off from Oakland, California, in May 1937 in a twin-engined Lockheed Electra. After a route that took them over the Caribbean, South America, Africa, Arabia, India, Burma, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia they stopped in Lae, New Guinea. The next leg of the flight on 2 July was a daunting 2,500-mile trip across the Pacific to tiny Howland Island. A US coastguard vessel, Itasca, was to guide them in by radio. The Lockheed, fitted with extra fuel tanks, never arrived. After 19 hours in the air, radio operators aboard the Itasca heard Earhart but apparently she was unable to hear them. She said the aircraft was low on fuel before contact was lost. A massive two-week search failed to find any trace of the plane or its crew. Wild theories flourished. It was suggested the US Navy had used the incident as an excuse to send aircraft over the Marshall Islands, where the Japanese were building military installations. Another, widely discounted, premise was that Earhart and Noonan were captured by the Japanese and shot as spies, or returned to the US secretly. Gillespie says ships reported radio distress signals that continued for several days, coming from the vicinity of Nikumaroro. They were dismissed as hoaxes or mistakes, he said. Then, three years after the crash, bones were found on Nikumaroro near a campsite where a castaway had obviously lived. A British administrator took the bones to a Fiji doctor who said they were from a small man. More than 50 years later, in 1997, forensic anthropologists re-evaluated the remains and said they were probably those of a white woman who was about 5ft 7ins tall. They have since been lost. &apos;It is a popular mystery shot through with myth and legend,&apos; said Gillespie. &apos;By using the latest techniques and technologies we may be able to get closer to the facts and find out what happened.&apos; tighar.org"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/09/theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines is reviewing its stake in Virgin Atlantic, raising speculation that it could be sold or offloaded in a stock market flotation.", "Sources close to the situation said the airline has sounded out investment banks about exploring options for the 49% shareholding, which Singapore Airlines acquired for \u00a3600m in 1999.", "Singapore Airlines could not be reached for comment, and Virgin Atlantic declined to comment on the development, which first came to light in today&apos;s Daily Telegraph.", "&quot;If Singapore Airlines is reviewing its stake then it is a matter for them,&quot; said Paul Charles, director of communications at Virgin Atlantic.", "&quot;Singapore Airlines is a a valued shareholder, and it has delivered substantial value to Virgin Atlantic,&quot; he added.", "Chew Choon Seng, the chief executive of Singapore Airlines, told analysts in May that the airline &quot;participated actively&quot; in boardroom discussions at Virgin Atlantic and was &quot;not watching the grass grow&quot;.", "The move will subject Virgin Atlantic and the other JFK slot-holder, British Airways, to a new competitive threat - a factor that may influence the Singapore Airlines review."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-09T14:28:22Z", "title": "Singapore Airlines reviews its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic", "tags": ["Business", "Airline industry", "Virgin Atlantic", "Air transport"], "article": "Singapore Airlines is reviewing its stake in Virgin Atlantic, raising speculation that it could be sold or offloaded in a stock market flotation.

In turn, budget airline executives including Mr Fernandes have predicted that the industry will split into two camps: 5-star airlines and 3-star airlines, with no-frills carriers making aggressive moves into the long-haul market. Fly Asian Express expects to launch its first UK flight - from Kuala Lumpur to London Stansted - around next Easter. Return flights will cost between \u00a3130 and \u00a3200. Food and in-flight entertainment will cost extra and the airline plans to offer a number of flat-bed seats at the front of the aircraft at a considerably higher cost. With about 380 seats per plane, the venture is expected to break even when the plane is 56% full. It is backed by an initial investment of $30m (\u00a315m) from Mr Fernandes and fellow AirAsia investors. Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic declined to comment on a report in today&apos;s Daily Telegraph that Singapore Airlines is reviewing its 49% stake in the transatlantic carrier. The review could lead to a sale or flotation of the holding, which analysts value at around \u00a31bn. Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines could not be reached for comment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/09/mediatop1002007.mondaymediasection104", "sentences": ["He has continued his obsession with building a solid presence in Asia with a string of acquisitions of traditional and digital agencies across South Korea, India, China and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-09T15:48:30Z", "title": "MediaGuardian 100 2007: Marketing & PR top 10", "tags": ["Media top 100 2007", "Media", "Virgin Group", "Virgin Media", "Richard Branson"], "article": "There is nothing like open media warfare to propel someone up the MediaGuardian 100 list. For serial entrepreneur and energetic marketer Richard Branson, who has rocketed from 29th to sixth place this year, it is in once again taking on the establishment - in this case the BSkyB empire. He clocked up a thwarted attempt to takeover ITV (could the UK have handled its biggest terrestrial channel being called Virgin TV?); a very public tit-for-tat dispute with Sky that resulted in the satellite operator&apos;s basic channels disappearing from Virgin Media; and, finally, has upped the ante with legal action against Sky. Simon Fuller (39) has seen a similar meteoric rise. Last year, he only made the top 10 list for marketing and PR, not the main 100 list. His appearance is perhaps because, in a bid to be a major global media and marketing player, Fuller and US entertainment heavyweight Robert Sillerman recently engineered a $1.3bn (\u00a3657m) bid to take over CKX, the company that owns the rights to American Idol. He also engineered the innovative - not to mention lucrative - $275m five-year media, marketing and merchandising deal for David Beckham to transfer to LA Galaxy. Time magazine also recently decided that Fuller had finally reached the pantheon of media giants by naming him in its annual top 100 of most influential people in the world. Sir Martin Sorrell (43) has continued to forge ahead in his bid to make WPP - the world&apos;s second-largest marketing and communications group - a truly 21st century entity. He has continued his obsession with building a solid presence in Asia with a string of acquisitions of traditional and digital agencies across South Korea, India, China and Singapore. Not wanting to be left out of a digital advertising services landgrab, WPP pounced on digital marketing firm 24/7 Real Media for $649m; and it has taken strategic stakes in firms such as mobile search and advertising company JumpTap and US-based VideoEgg. As architect of the strategy to rejuvenate the Tory party, ex-Saatchi &amp; Saatchi ad man Steve Hilton (80) makes the power list as a heavy-hitter in the PR, advertising and marketing spheres. The 37-year-old, who is godfather to David Cameron&apos;s first child, has set about rebranding the fusty image of the Conservatives, complete with new logo, web 2.0 initiatives such as Webcameron, and a Tory party viral ad campaign called &quot;The inner tosser&quot;. Part of the plan has involved severing ties going back almost 30 years with the Saatchi brothers by dropping ad agency M&amp;C Saatchi in favour of using sexier, trendier firms such as Karmarama. Matthew Freud (86) has managed to hold his ground this year, as his PR agency Freud Communications has expanded its media advertising capability by purchasing ad agency DFGW and has created its first ad for client Asda. However, his attempt at moving into publishing with the acquisition of Press Gazette, with Piers Morgan, ended in failure. The past year also saw the departure of Kris Thykier, Matthew Freud&apos;s right-hand man of 15 years, who left to set up a film production company with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels producer Matthew Vaughn. James Kydd, the former marketing director of Virgin Mobile and now managing director of Virgin Media, gets the nod for a valiant marketing effort against the odds. Battling to throw off the shackles of NTL&apos;s fusty, unreliable image Kydd launched a \u00a325m campaign featuring Uma Thurman to announce the arrival of the freshly minted Virgin Media. Despite seemingly being hamstrung by analyst forecasts that customers would turn away from Virgin without Sky&apos;s basic channels - and shows like 24 and Lost - the company&apos;s latest customer forecasts appear to show it may just have marketed its way through the worst of the storm. Kydd also took the risk of filling Carphone Warehouse&apos;s vacant shoes by taking over Big Brother sponsorship this summer. Procter &amp; Gamble&apos;s Roisin Donnelly became only the third woman to be named the UK&apos;s top marketer in the 23-year history of the prestigious Marketing Society Awards for Excellence. P&amp;G, which owns brands including Gillette, Pantene, Wella, Pringles, Max Factor and Ariel, is the biggest advertiser in the UK spending in excess of \u00a3180m annually. Last year, Carphone Warehouse boss Charles Dunstone ranked 20th in the MediaGuardian 100 but this year he hasn&apos;t made the cut at all. This is may be because he shook up the business status quo last year by launching &quot;free&quot; broadband and sparking a marketing war. Dunstone won the battle to buy AOL&apos;s internet access arm, for \u00a3370m, and recently signed a three-year deal to sponsor The X Factor, effectively replacing Carphone&apos;s deal with Big Brother, which it exited following the Shilpa Shetty racism row. By and large, Dunstone&apos;s profile in the UK has been much more low-key this time around, possibly because of a focus on launching into the US in a joint venture with Best Buy. Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s Steve Sharp, the man behind the phenomenally successful &quot;Twiggy&quot; campaign, has maintained a vibrancy in the retailer&apos;s marketing, with the campaign being awarded the grand Prix at the Marketing Society Awards. Tim Allan, the former Labour party spin doctor and founder of Portland PR, has built on the firm&apos;s new media credentials of last year when he secured the Google account. In April, the rapidly growing internet darling Bebo appointed Portland PR as its first UK PR agency, handing the agency a wide-ranging corporate, consumer and public affairs brief. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

There were suggestions yesterday that Temasek could be interested in Lloyds TSB, up 6.5p to 566.5p, but many traders believe Standard would be a more likely target.   Onto the never-ending story, the bid battle for Dutch banking group ABN Amro. Today&apos;s development saw ABN effectively given permission to sell its US business LaSalle to Bank of America for $21bn.   This disposal boosts Barclays, which is battling with a rival bidding consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland. The RBS-led offer was predicated on LaSalle remaining part of ABN, although traders still think RBS may now return with a revised bid to reflect the new circumstances.   Barclays added 6p to 724.5p, while RBS rose 5.5p to 640p.   In the drinks world, Magners cider maker C&amp;C slumped 1.65 cents to \u20ac8.45 after the Irish group warned the wet summer was hitting sales volumes. Citigroup pointed out that as well as the weather problems, the company was also facing increased competition from Scottish &amp; Newcastle, and cut its price target from \u20ac11.2 to \u20ac10. Meanwhile S&amp;N lost 6p to 629p.   JD Wetherspoon fell 1.5p to 555p as Bridgewell said it would one of the pub groups most effected by any poor summer trading.   Bridgewell said: &quot;The most highly operationally geared pub company is Wetherspoon where we have an underweight rating and a 500p price target. It will release its current trading in a pre-close statement on Thursday.&quot;   Soft drinks groups also lost their fizz. Britvic fell 10.75p to 356.75p on fears it may follow C&amp;C and reveal a summer downturn. The shares were not helped by Altium Securities starting coverage with a reduce rating and 330p price target.   &quot;While we remain of the view that Britvic should benefit from its cost reduction programme, this may not be sufficient to offset what we suspect is a challenging trading environment,&quot; said Altium. &quot;In our view AG Barr offers more defensive qualities. It also has net cash, versus around \u00a3440m of debt at Britvic.&quot;   However, worries about poor trading because of the weather outweighed Altium&apos;s add recommendation for AG Barr, and the company&apos;s shares lost 21p to \u00a312.85.   Cadbury Schweppes, which encompasses soft drinks and chocolate, fell 8p to 655.5p after it said the recent floods had disrupted production at its Sheffield mint and wine gums factory. Sweet-making has been temporarily suspended, and it is expected to be several weeks until things are back to normal.   The company is also set to be fined early next week over the salmonella scare last summer.   But overall leading shares were in a positive mood. The FTSE 100 closed 19 points higher at 6716.7 \u2014 a six and a half year high \u2014 while the FTSE 250 added 113.9 to 11922.9.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher when trading opened, despite US retail sales figures showing their biggest monthly decline in nearly two years in June. Traders said the figures showed that consumer confidence was being hit by a number of factors, including higher oil prices and the subprime mortgage lending problems, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to consider cutting US interest rates.   The news pushed sterling to a 26-year high against the dollar.   Back in the UK, hedge fund manager Man Group added another 17p to 633.5p on further consideration of its upbeat annual meeting statement yesterday, while property group Quintain Estates rose 40.5p to 895.5p on takeover hopes. Mortgage bank HBOS has just bought a stake of 11.898% in the company from Rock Investments, the vehicle of property investor Paul Kemsley.   Another property firm, Marylebone Warwick Balfour, added 15p to 278p as it said it had started talks over a possible sale of its Malmaison and Hotel du Vin businesses.   Marketing group Aegis rose 5.5p to 141.5p on news it had won the European media buying account for US consumer group Johnson &amp; Johnson. UBS also issued a positive note on the business, saying: &quot;We think the other major ad agencies \u2014 WPP, Publicis and Havas \u2014 would be very interested in acquiring Aegis. We estimate WPP and Publicis could afford to pay up to \u00a32, with even Havas affording this figure if it can tie up with a partner such as WPP.   &quot;While \u00a32 represents a near 50% premium to the current share price, we think management may be tempted by recent digital transactions to push for a higher sale price, especially as they are aware of the strategic importance of Aegis to both WPP and Publicis. A sum of the parts valuation for Aegis could be high as 235p or more.&quot;   But B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher slipped 1.25p to 223.5p as JP Morgan cut its price target from 300p to 285p, although the bank kept its overweight rating. Also today came news that B&amp;Q is suing a Chinese firm for defamation and breach of contract.   Miners were mixed after the excitement yesterday over Rio Tinto&apos;s $38bn bid for Alcan. Rio fell 80p to \u00a337.30 while BHP Billiton \u2014 which some traders believe could bid for Alcan&apos;s losing bidder Alcoa \u2014 dropped 27p to \u00a315.27. But Vedanta Resources added 30p to \u00a318.30.   In what is becoming a new tradition, there was a late Friday afternoon profit warning from support services group Carter &amp; Carter which sent its shares crashing 214p to 52p, an 80% drop. Two weeks ago the company \u2014 whose founder and chief executive Phillip Carter was killed in a helicopter crash in May \u2014 issued a pessimistic trading update half an hour before the market closed for the weekend. Today the statement came at 4.14 pm, saying the company had failed in winning 15 contracts it had bid for in the government&apos;s Pathways to Work programme. On top of that, performance from its construction training programme was worse than expected at the time of the June announcement, its apprenticeship business was producing a lower level of achievers than hoped, and the takeup under the Train to Gain programme was behind expectations.   It said as a result profits for the year would be \u00a310.5m, down from the \u00a315.5m predicted two weeks ago, and it was in the process of renegotiating its bank facilities.   Also in for a heavy fall was Aim-listed Renewable Power &amp; Light, which slumped 75.75p to 38.75p after it said it would make a loss for the year rather than the expected $25m profit. It blamed its difficulties on losing out on supplies of palm oil, which would have fuelled its power plants. It is suing the US supplier, Safari, for breach of contract for failing to deliver the palm oil at the agreed price, after prices rose on world markets since the contract was agreed.   The company&apos;s shares were suspended last week when news of the palm oil problem emerged.   &quot;Clearly this is terrible news for RPL,&quot; said Ambrian Research. &quot;But the wider repercussions for the industry could also be damaging. Biofuel producers will need to read the small print of contracts to see if their suppliers can default on deliveries due to the rapid rise in feedstocks.   &quot;It certainly adds credence to companies like D1 Oils, which is working on a plantation to refinery model.&quot;   D1 however was also hit by the news, down 7.5p to 277.25p.   Telecoms minnow Pipex fell 0.5p to 12.75p. Italy&apos;s Tiscali has bought the company&apos;s broadband assets for \u00a3210m. Traders said this could be bad news for Cable &amp; Wireless, which provide network services to Pipex, since Tiscali has its own network. But C&amp;W issued a statement saying: &quot;We&apos;re very happy to confirm that the contract we had with Pipex remains in place under the new Tiscali ownership.&quot;   C&amp;W shares added 2.1p to 194.5p.   NXT, the specialist in flat panel loudspeakers, slipped 1.25p to 13.25p after raising \u00a3500,000 via convertible loan notes and warning of a shortfall in projected sales growth.   TV production company RDF Media fell 1p to 255.5p. In a trading statement last week it was puffing its documentaries including the one where &quot;the Queen and the royal household will be observed over a year in a five part series for BBC 1.&quot;   Sadly the headlines today were more about the gaffe over the Queen storming or not storming out of a photo shoot with Anne Leibovitz, a sequence from a promotional tape for the RDF film which lead to an apology to the Royals from the BBC.   Finally consultancy group Wyatt was suspended at 22p, up 3p, awaiting news of an earnings-enhancing reverse takeover, as reported here.

I could see plumes of blue smoke, but it was not until I got up close that I discovered what was being cooked on the charcoal - carciofi ripieni alla griglia About 50 small purple artichokes had been grilled among the hot coals. They were filled with a vibrant green stuffing and anointed with thick green olive oil from a clear plastic bottle. I was handed a couple of clean, crumpled napkins from the pocket of the stall holder. He took another drag of his cigarette and resumed chatting with his two friends while turning some red peppers on the grill. I stood by the stall peeling the burnt outside leaves, dropping them into a box below. The inside was delicious and sweet - then I came to the stuffing. Toasted pine nuts had been mixed with lots of chopped parsley, garlic, dried chilli, salt, lemon juice, and lashings of the local olive oil which ran down my wrist. It was a great feeling warming myself on this cold day by the charcoal fire, eating these delicious morsels. Damascus, Syria Nuts and seeds feature in dishes throughout the Levant, incredibly fresh and delicious and completely different from the stale stuff we are sold in the west - not to mention cheaper. Each trader has old family recipes for lohz, nuts roasted with spices and sugar then sprinkled with salt and a squeeze of lemon.  In the spice-scented passages of the souk in Damascus I saw an ingenious portable nut stall made from a bicycle. At the front where a basket would have been was a flat hot plate heated underneath with charcoal, ensuring that the nuts were freshly roasted in small batches. On top was a 6ft metal chimney so you smelt your snack long before you saw the queue. And that&apos;s the best advice - when lost in the souk, follow your nose.  Singapore Even though I arrived in steamy Singapore in the middle of the night, I wanted to begin my mission immediately. A friend had told me about roti prata, based on the Indian flat bread, and despite the late hour I was determined to find it.  I asked my taxi driver to take me to the best roti prata stall in Singapore. The streets seemed ominously quiet, but five dollars later we turned a corner and I saw a small cafe, its canary yellow plastic tables and fluorescent lights welcoming prospective diners - and there were hundreds.  For the length of the block, there was no footpath to be seen - only happy faces seated at flimsy chairs and tables.  And this was 1.30am on a Tuesday. I sat down and finally my roti arrived. I tore it to pieces, dipped it into a spicy curry sauce and devoured.  Istanbul, Turkey One of the city&apos;s most famous street foods is the delicious midye dolmasi, a dish of plump mussels stuffed with short-grain rice, raisins, pine nuts, and a heady mix of cinnamon, ground allspice, paprika, cayenne pepper, and ground cloves, then steamed, and served with wedges of lemon. It is amazing that they can be sold so cheaply when someone has had to open the individual mussels with a knife like an oyster.  Hanoi, Vietnam In the centre of town, I counted about 10 outdoor cafes selling exactly the same prawn cakes. Like many Vietnamese dishes, they are served with salad, a selection of mixed fresh herbs, lettuce and crisp green vegetables.  Small pieces of meat or fish can be wrapped in a leaf and eaten from the hand or dipped with chopsticks into one of the many spectacular dipping sauces. Five cakes, sauce and salad costs less than a dollar.  Salvador da Bahia, Brazil Acaraj\u00e9 has virtual cult status in this colonial city on the northern coast. The bean patties, which came to Brazil with the slaves from west Africa, are like large spicy falafel and extremely tasty, particularly in combination with salt-dried prawns, chilli salsa and salad. Stalls are set up near market squares filled with plastic tables and chairs.

This was the former plantation on which a few generations ago his ancestors had worked, lived, loved and died, owned as property by white masters. &apos;You must assume that it&apos;s family here,&apos; Sharpton said, referring to the abandoned slave graveyard. A few weeks previously Reverend Sharpton, one of America&apos;s most outspoken black civil rights leaders, had not known of the cemetery&apos;s existence. But researchers had explored his genealogy and broken the news to him. Sharpton&apos;s story had an astonishing twist: the genealogists discovered that his ancestors had once been owned by the ancestors of Strom Thurmond, the Senator and former segregationist who once ran for president on a racist platform. The phrase &apos;ironic coincidence&apos; did not begin to cover it. Dozens of reporters tagged along when Sharpton first visited the Edgefield woods, yet it was clear he was genuinely stunned by what he called &apos;the greatest shock&apos; of his life. &apos;It profoundly affected him,&apos; said Tony Burroughs, a genealogist who worked on the project. Sharpton was not alone. America has embarked on an amazing journey to explore its own past. Millions of Americans of every creed and colour are exploring their family histories in a genealogy boom that is redefining who they are and what it means to be American. The internet has allowed people to find obscure information at the click of a mouse that was previously locked away on dusty library shelves. They are also using modern DNA techniques to research their racial history, creating a multi-million dollar industry of consumer genetics. Like Sharpton, many are making shocking discoveries. They are finding slaves and slave-owners. Far from being a nation of different races, many are finding they have mixed pasts. Blacks are discovering they have white blood, whites are finding black relatives. Native Americans are growing in numbers, not because of a high birth rate, but because many Americans are discovering unknown native ancestors written in their DNA. And it is impacting right up to the highest in the land. Just after the Sharpton story broke, other genealogists revealed they had discovered presidential hopeful Barack Obama&apos;s family - through his white mother - had also once owned slaves. Just like the Thurmonds. That means the man who hopes to become America&apos;s first black president could be the direct descendant not of black slaves, but of white slave-owners. Literally, nothing is now as black and white as it once seemed. America has embarked on an identity revolution. Last year, Professor Peter Fine at Florida Atlantic University had an idea for an art class. He would gather a group of students to produce work around their idea of their racial identity. But as part of the class he asked them to take a DNA test that would break down their racial background. His bet was that most of the class - of whom the majority saw themselves as whites of European descent - had no real idea who they were. He was right. Of 13 students, only one turned out to be completely European. The rest displayed a mixture of European, Native American, African and Asian genes. The one black student turned out to be 21 per cent white. Fine himself - who admits to looking like a corn-fed stereotype of a white Midwesterner - discovered he was a quarter Native American. &apos;I honestly think these tests could have a large effect on American consciousness of who we are. If Americans recognise themselves as a mixed group of people, that could really change things,&apos; he said. Fine has a point. For centuries, America has been less a racial melting pot and more a stew, where different communities bump up against each other, but keep mostly to themselves. Yet, as millions of Americans take DNA tests, they are discovering a surprising truth: America&apos;s strict racial lines are, in fact, blurred. One-third of white Americans, according to some tests, will possess between two and 20 per cent African genes. The majority of black Americans have some European ancestors. For a few hundred dollars, Americans can radically alter the way they think of themselves through a new industry that has been dubbed &apos;recreational genetics&apos;. Dozens of companies now offer DNA tests, ranging from the basic - breaking down a person&apos;s racial profile into broad categories such as European or Native American - to more detailed ones which claim to identify specific regions or tribes of the world. All a consumer usually has to do is take a swab from inside their cheek to provide a cell sample and then wait for the post. It has led to some bizarre developments. One American discovered Jewish genes in his DNA and is now seeking to get Israeli citizenship. Some white college applicants, upon discovering they have African or Asian or Native American DNA, have applied for scholarships aimed at minorities. A black woman discovered 10 per cent British DNA in her test and has now identified the Scottish slave owners who used to own her ancestors. She has contacted their modern descendants - owners of a large fortune - and wants them to take tests, too. Some researchers will go to extremes to get samples from others. People have stalked newly discovered relatives, even going through rubbish to snatch DNA samples if they refuse to volunteer them. Some have even plucked hair from newly deceased relatives. For the celebrity-minded, DNA profiles of descendants of famous historical figures have been released on the internet, including Thomas Jefferson, General Robert E Lee, Marie Antoinette and Genghis Khan. One website plans to add others soon, including DNA profiles of people related to Columbus and Billy the Kid. DNA research is having a transforming effect on millions of lives. That is what happened with Issac Carter, 33, one of Fine&apos;s students. He is black but his family history told of a Native American ancestor, while his tests showed he was a lot whiter than he thought and had no Native American blood at all. &apos;My history has been all jumbled up,&apos; he said. In fact, the whole world of Native Americans has been thrown into turmoil. Many tribes, some of whom have become rich on the back of casino gambling, are now flooded with calls from people suddenly claiming to have discovered their Native American background. A country known for its racial faultlines has discovered a new sense of fluidity. The identities emerging are complex and multi-faceted. Take another of Fine&apos;s students, Shannon O&apos;Brien. Hailing from small-town Ohio with a name like O&apos;Brien, her identity as a white American should be secure. But O&apos;Brien&apos;s mother is Mexican and she has dark hair and skin. Many people assume she is Hispanic. Yet she has never felt any great affinity with a Hispanic identity and speaks no Spanish. &apos;People used to tell me that I should change my name to make it more Hispanic,&apos; she said. But, after her test results came in, she was identified as 61 per cent European, 26 per cent Native American and 13 per cent African. Does any racial label quite cover the complexity of that? &apos;I have my identity in my own mind,&apos; O&apos;Brien said. &apos;It is not just what people think when they see me. It is not so simple any more.&apos; But the one group for whom DNA tests have really stoked a sense of turmoil is black Americans. In America&apos;s long history of immigration, they are the people who have no &apos;old country&apos; to look back to. Slavery rendered mute any tangible links to Africa beyond having black skin. It left a cultural legacy that is easy to downplay if you are not a black American, but hard to overestimate if you are. Issac Carter&apos;s experiences with DNA in Professor Fine&apos;s class have spurred him on to further exploration. He plans to take a more detailed test that could identify markers in his DNA that hint at specific regions or tribes in Africa. &apos;I want to reclaim my history,&apos; Carter said. &apos;My wife is Indian. She speaks her native language. She knows where her family is from. I want to know my history, too.&apos; If the tests link him to somewhere specific in Africa, Carter intends to visit and even study the local language. &apos;We now have the ability to reconnect,&apos; he added. He is not alone. Scientists are scouring America and Africa collecting DNA and trying to find common genetic markers that allow links to be made between black Americans and African tribes. One of the most prominent is the Roots Project, run by Boston scientist Dr Bruce Jackson. He has collected DNA samples from 10,000 black Americans and is comparing them to DNA excavated from slave burial grounds in America and back to specific African tribes. The idea of being able to make such links has a powerful attraction for even the most high-profile black Americans. Last year a TV show called African American Lives, hosted by Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr, explored the genealogy and DNA of nine black Americans, including Oprah Winfrey, comedian Chris Tucker and actress Whoopi Goldberg. It ended up drawing links back to Africa, even taking Tucker to Angola, from where, the tests seemed to indicate, his ancestors hailed. The show has had a profound effect on many black Americans, popularising the tests. Yet experts say the science is far from perfect. They point out that beyond a few generations any human is descended from a huge pool of ancestors. The fact that a great-great-great-great-grandparent was from Ghana does not make one Ghanaian. The science is also largely reliant upon statistical analysis and not always exact DNA markers. Professor Troy Duster, of New York University, calls some DNA advocates &apos;pied pipers&apos; for making claims that their science cannot back up and playing up to a popular feeling that anything involving genetics is 100 per cent accurate. &apos;There is a cultural feeling that DNA evidence is sacrosanct. But a kind of false precision is rampant right now,&apos; says Duster. But such a debate only highlights how complex race has become in America. It is not just a matter of skin colour any more; it is also about how society perceives you. O&apos;Brien&apos;s reflection may scream Hispanic, but that is not her choice of identity. And Professor Fine may be a quarter Native American, but he admits his pale complexion means he will always be seen as white: &apos;I know I still have all the privileges of being white in America.&apos; Greater knowledge can pose troubling questions. While hosting African American Lives, Professor Gates, one of America&apos;s most eminent black scholars, was stunned to find he was half European. He had more ancestors in France and Ireland than in Africa. Such discoveries unsettle even the greatest mind. In the show, Gates lamented what this meant to a proud black American. &apos;I have the blues,&apos; he said, and then asked: &apos;Can I still have the blues?&apos; Genealogy is now the second most common hobby in America (after gardening). Genealogy websites are the second most commonly visited on the internet (after pornography). It is big business. The ancestry.com website has a database of five billion records and attracts four million visitors a month. The biggest player is the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, better known as the Mormons. The Mormon dominance of the booming genealogy industry is little known. The church puts a religious duty on its members to search out their family trees. &apos;We believe that families are eternal in nature. Death is not the end of a family relationship. We will see a great gathering. We will be reunited beyond the veil of death,&apos; said Paul Nauta, a Mormon spokesman on family history research. The doctrinal need is simple: Mormons believe the dead can be converted and have their souls saved. Thus Mormons scour the earth for genealogical records for any human being, which makes their church the best resource for millions of people researching their family histories. The greatest source of genealogical knowledge in the world is the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is a huge complex that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year. But it is just the centre of a global empire. The Mormons have set up subsidiary Family History Centers across the world. There are 4,000 in 88 countries, from Sydney to Singapore and London to Lima. They also have 200 camera teams roaming the earth, transferring records on to microfilm. They take in births, marriages, wills, deaths, property deeds, legal documents and military records. On any given day there are Mormon film crews working in 45 countries. For the ambition of the church is huge: to make all genealogical records of every human life available on the internet. &apos;Still less than one per cent of the world records are accessible on the internet. So far we have just the tip of the iceberg,&apos; says Nauta. It is the internet more than anything else that has enabled millions of Americans to find their family histories, forging links abroad and giving US citizens, many of whom are self-conscious about their country&apos;s youth, a link to older nations and longer histories. Nauta, for example, has traced his family back to a village in Italy. Now he visits every two years. But others make less happy discoveries, especially around America&apos;s greatest historical scar: slavery. That is where Barack Obama&apos;s past came back to haunt him. Obama is seen as black by most Americans. Yet that skin colour comes from his Kenyan father, who met his white mother, from Kansas, at college. That prompted some leading black commentators to claim that Obama is not a real black American (or not black enough). This, in turn, led a group of genealogists to trace Obama&apos;s mother&apos;s family back to before the Civil War - and they found that some were slave-owners. That is how - if he wins the 2008 race - America&apos;s first ever black president will be the direct descendant of white slave-owners. It is, ironically, an experience that many white Americans are having. In the wake of the Obama news, Chicago journalist Mark Brown asked his mother about his own background. He had assumed his family, most of whom hailed from Missouri and Kentucky hill country, had been too poor to own slaves. Not so. Soon he was looking at dusty documents that bore the name of his great-great-great-grandfather and also the black slaves he owned. &apos;It was a little difficult to process at first. I see there is a part my family played in this,&apos; Brown said. There was more, too. One slave was listed as: &apos;One negro boy named Tom, about 17 years old, of yellow complexion.&apos; That skin colour most likely meant that Tom was fathered by a white man. As Tom was owned by Mark Brown&apos;s family, he was probably related to Brown. As would be his modern descendants. Brown had discovered a personal family link to America&apos;s greatest shame, but also possibly a whole new branch of relatives - who were black. He now has a choice that is intriguing and agonising. &apos;People are suggesting I should try to trace the slaves and find them. But I am worried about opening a can of worms, opening it for a whole family,&apos; he said. Of course, it is black Americans who have to face the deepest traumas. Most blacks joining the genealogy boom expect to find a slave ancestor. But when it happens the experience can be upsetting. They must face the reality of descending from chattel slaves, living in bondage, and being beaten and brutalised at the hands of white masters. &apos;These were our ancestors. That is kind of rough to take,&apos; said genealogist Tony Burroughs. It can also question the whole notion of black identity in America. Allen McClain has been researching his family history for 20 years. It has been difficult, as he rapidly came up against the wall obstructing all black genealogy: the Civil War. Probing before that often means looking for ancestors in the wills and property deeds of white families - ancestors who were legally the property of others, with a value of a few hundred dollars, listed there alongside pigs, cows and bushels of corn. McClain, a 42-year-old Air Force veteran who now lives in Baltimore, traced his family back to rural North Carolina, where he found his first direct slave ancestor. Martha Eaton was his great-great-great-grandmother. She was found in the will of a white slave-owning family, listed alongside the rest of their estate. McClain felt &apos;very emotional&apos; looking at these documents. &apos;This was a commodity,&apos; he said, his voice growing a little soft. &apos;I thought, how could you? This is someone&apos;s life.&apos; But it is not just slavery that confronts black Americans delving into their past. Emancipation after the Civil War barely began to address their forefathers&apos; problems. After the war, the South imposed a system of brutal segregation known as Jim Crow Laws. Blacks were kept as virtual peons by rural share-cropping, and denied the vote. Obedience was enforced by lynching. So when Brooklyn-born Jennifer Stokes began to trace her family into the South of her parents&apos; birth, she came across the shock of her family&apos;s treatment by their fellow American citizens just 100 or so years ago. Her family&apos;s oral history had long contained an ancestor who had been lynched in South Carolina. Now she was able to read about it in an 1895 newspaper. Her great-great-great-uncle, William Stokes, had been hung and his body riddled with bullets. The &apos;excuse&apos; for such a brutal crime was a common one in a South obsessed with its white manhood. He had been accused of sexually assaulting a white woman. Throughout the description of his murder, the article referred to Stokes dismissively as &apos;Bill&apos;. &apos;It was very raw. It made it more real. It&apos;s one thing to hear about it and another to read it,&apos; Stokes said. Making such history personal has spelled out how the full story of black Americans is still not acknowledged by white America. The common American vision of settlers and hard-working immigrants still holds sway in popular culture. Yet it is a version of history that excludes not only what happened to Native Americans, but also how America&apos;s military and economic might was built on the back of black slaves. Stokes bristles at the word &apos;slave&apos; being used to describe her ancestors. &apos;They were enslaved. I prefer that word,&apos; she said. &apos;They were forced to be slaves. It was a system. It was not who they were.&apos; She says it again, her voice firm and brooking no discussion: &apos;They were enslaved.&apos; It is no wonder some black Americans emerge from the experience of looking for their ancestors wondering what their role in America really is. Lisa Salley is a successful engineer whose work has taken her all over the world. She has also traced many of her family&apos;s roots to the town of Smoaks and the surrounding countryside in South Carolina. Now, Lisa is driven by a mission to tell her family story for the next generation. &apos;I didn&apos;t want my nieces and nephews to define themselves via MTV,&apos; she said. &apos;I wanted to preserve our story before it is lost.&apos; Her work has united disparate strands of family and she is planning a huge reunion in Smoaks next summer. But she has found slave ancestors, and mulattos, too - usually the result of rape by white masters. She has found evidence of her family being split up on the whims of their white owners. It has left Salley with a sense that she does not really belong in the land of her birth. &apos;I have no intention of retiring in the US. Going other places there was a general acceptance of me just based on my professional qualifications. I have never felt that in America,&apos; she said. But amid all the horror of exploring slavery, there are positive aspects at play. No matter what colour your skin, the search for an ancestor pays tribute to a life forgotten: a life every bit as valuable as anyone else&apos;s. For many black Americans, the moment of discovering a slave ancestor has a sweetness to it. A vindication, too. &apos;I call it a genealogy high,&apos; said McClain. &apos;It makes it all worth it.&apos; The great southern writer William Faulkner once wrote: &apos;The past is not dead. In fact, it&apos;s not even past.&apos; Nothing illustrates that more in America than the identity revolutions being inspired by genealogy and DNA research. They show that actions and people hidden in the past - even to the point of being encoded in someone&apos;s genes - can profoundly shape the present. Even change it. On one hand they can expose divisions and remind us of the cruelty of history. One complaint of many blacks researching their family histories is that white families still often refuse to help them. Native Americans often complain they are swamped by &apos;American Indian Princess syndrome&apos;, because every white person wants native DNA in their past. In a world of minority grants, scholarships and Indian gambling rights, any debate over DNA and race could easily also become an argument over resources. But just as often there are happier moments that show how rigid ideas of race and identity are beginning to melt in America. Salley had one of those moments. In researching her family she discovered a slave ancestor who had children with her white master, Thomas Kinsey. She then traced the Kinseys to their modern descendants and got in touch. She met up with an elderly white woman, Myrtle Linder. Though she was white and Salley was black, the two women were likely distant cousins. Linder was feisty, still chopping wood in her own backyard despite her advanced years. Salley recognised the same independent spirit she felt in herself. &apos;I thought: &quot;Now these are my people, too,&quot;&apos; she laughed. And they were. The two women became firm friends. After all, they were family. Skin colour did not matter. It is individual moments like this that can slowly change a nation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/15/britishidentity.news", "sentences": ["Visitors to their website learn that Singapore is the second most densely populated country in the world, or that more Cape Verdeans live outside their country than in it."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-14T23:06:10Z", "title": "Search for the world in one city", "tags": ["UK news", "British identity and society", "Technology", "Travel"], "article": "When they were boys, Alex Horne and Owen Powell obsessively collected Panini football stickers. Now the two friends have embarked on a more daunting task: instead of hunting down that elusive Portuguese striker, they are trying to find a person from every country in the world who lives in London. Their quest for the &apos;World in One City&apos; was launched on 24 October last year, United Nations Day. More than seven months later, they have ticked off more than half of the UN&apos;s 192 official nationalities, starting with the Philippines and leading in the last week alone to Albania, Finland, Uganda, Vietnam and Senegal, the 112th profile added to their blog, worldinonecity.blogspot.com. The 2001 census said the capital contained people who said they were from a total of 243 countries. The pair, who perform separately as comedians, began their quest at Charing Cross - the official epicentre of the capital, from which all distances to and from London are measured - plucking up the courage to approach their first &apos;foreigner&apos;, Carl from the Philippines, who was guarding a motion simulator attraction in the Trocadero centre in Piccadilly. Since then they have accosted road-sweepers, an emergency plumber, a work colleague, neighbours, waiters and, as the project has mushroomed, friends of candidates already signed up. One chain of people took them from Ligia, a Colombian, to her colleague from Bulgaria, to her housemate from Mexico, to a percussionist from Spain whom Owen interviewed while they watched their football teams (Seville and Tottenham Hotspur) playing each other in the Uefa Cup. Most of the people are in their twenties and thirties, which Powell thinks is because so many people in London are young. He and Horne are both 28. An unscientific survey of the profiles involved suggests that most people who have come to London want to stay. Many like the capital&apos;s buzz and feeling of tolerance, and there are even votes for the weather and the food. However, most find London a hard place to make English friends and miss their friends and families and home cooking. Some have fled violence, whether domestic or warfare. Others left middle-class families with servants to further their careers. Some arrived at railway stations with no home, no money and almost no English; others were transferred by employers to work in the City. Some left children behind; others came to be with lovers. Now their jobs include waiter and cafe owner, butler and banker, designers, an architect, teachers, people who hand out free newspapers, artists and musicians, office workers and a property manager for the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Their stories are punctuated by the two friends&apos; factual data. Visitors to their website learn that Singapore is the second most densely populated country in the world, or that more Cape Verdeans live outside their country than in it. Other asides are more philosophical, as they discuss what they are learning about the project, immigration, politics and detail about the lives that most Londoners will never delve into. &apos;We went into the project thinking it was going to be very light-hearted and fun,&apos; said Horne. &apos;Some of the things are fun, but some are pretty harrowing. The Kyrgyzstani lady I met two days ago came to escape a husband who was beating her up. She reckons 80 per cent of women in Kyrgyzstan are beaten regularly by their husbands. It&apos;s the sort of country you never really read about. Each story is different, some will be sad, some will be happy.&apos; Along the way, Horne and Powell, who met at Cambridge University, have also learnt a lot about London, from its architecture to where to get good Ghanaian food and about ethical tensions between English people and recent immigrants, or between different ethnic groups. Many Afro-Caribbeans, for example, resent the influx of eastern Europeans, Horne said. &apos;They feel quite loyal to being a part of British history, but they don&apos;t feel loyalty to the European Union.&apos; The website where their &apos;collection&apos; is being logged lists the nationalities in the order they are found, generating a quirky and perhaps democratic view of the world. The Philippines, Poland and Bangladesh sit on top and the Netherlands is sandwiched between Nigeria and Ireland, with Greece falling between Indonesia and Zimbabwe. Horne and Powell both have solo shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival next month and hope to stage a one-off show about their project. They have hopes of a book deal, and would like to get everybody into one room for a worldwide party.

On Tuesday Virgin Rail, in which Virgin has a majority stake in a joint venture with Stagecoach, failed in its attempt to keep running Cross Country, one of the two franchises it operates on the privatised rail network. The unhappiness at losing out to rival operator Arriva was palpable. Virgin Rail&apos;s chief executive Tony Collins said: &apos;We are obviously extremely disappointed at today&apos;s announcement.&apos; Rail operations are not the only part of Branson&apos;s empire in flux. Singapore Airlines, partner in his airline Virgin Atlantic, indicated on Monday that it might sell its 49 per cent stake, prompting analysts to ask why and whether Virgin might be a winner or a loser from the Open Skies agreement liberalising air transport between Europe and the US. Meanwhile, Virgin is hurting on the high street, with its Megastore operation continuing to suffer, as have its peers, from difficult trading conditions and the switch from buying CDs to downloading music. Accounts for 2006 show a loss of some \u00a360m. Robert Clark of Retail Knowledge bank says: &apos;They have been a notable presence on the high street, but clearly have not had a particularly impressive profitability record.&apos; And Virgin Media, the US-quoted company formed when Branson sold Virgin mobile to cable group NTL, has been in the headlines for the wrong reasons - chiefly a spat with BSkyB cutting off its viewers from key channels - and is being stalked by private equity group Carlyle. Branson may sell out, having turned down a private equity approach last year. But if he does cash in - and a Carlyle bid at the mooted figure of \u00a311bn would mean a tidy return - it will, in the eyes of some analysts, draw a line under one of Branson&apos;s less glorious forays. Virgin is accustomed to difficulties. When Virgin Trains was launched in the 1990s it was problematic, with poor service and punctuality prompting many observers to question if it would damage Branson and the Virgin image; an attempt to run the National Lottery failed; Virgin Cola has not been a global success, and neither have smaller businesses from selling bridal wear to cosmetics and clothing. The difficulty is that although Virgin may be in the spotlight, that light cannot reveal the full impact of gains and losses because so much of the group is hidden from view. Virgin is made up of a web of some 350 companies, many of which are registered overseas. Virgin Group itself is a holding company, whose last accounts record a loss of \u00a33.9m for the year to March 2006. It is not clear what this tells us. Some component Virgin companies made losses in the same period: Virgin Bride, for example, lost \u00a3637,000, Virgin Drinks Group \u00a37.1m. But Virgin Holdings, the holding company for Branson&apos;s airline and rail operations, made an \u00a387m profit for the same period. So could the group&apos;s fortunes be changing? Patrick Barwise, emeritus professor of management and marketing at the London Business School, says: &apos;Quite a few things are going wrong for Branson at the moment. One response could be that this is finally revealing a flaw in what is essentially a conglomerate model - that it does not work and that the market is telling him this. Another could be that he is getting older and he is losing interest.&apos; Last week&apos;s train franchise loss clearly hurt Virgin Rail. Andrew Fitchie, analyst at Collins Stewart, says: &apos;It is a definite knock.&apos; However, as he points out, the immediate financial implications are not major because Virgin was operating the service on &apos;letter agreement&apos;, where it took little revenue risk, but made little profit in running it for the DFT. However, Fitchie says: &apos;This is really a lost opportunity.&apos; Virgin was hoping to renew the franchise on terms that would make it a profit. In its 2006 accounts Virgin Rail talked of strong passenger growth on Cross Country, breaking the 2 million mark, raising the number of people travelling on the franchise by two-thirds since 1997, when it started running the service. Fitchie estimates the value of the deal at \u00a3100m over its nine-year life to Arriva, which won it. Virgin now goes from being a two franchise operator to a singleton - running the west coast mainline. The airline situation is equally unclear. By any reckoning, Virgin Atlantic is key to the Branson empire, helping to define him as a consumer&apos;s champion in its &apos;dirty tricks&apos; battle with British Airways enhancing Branson&apos;s reputation as a tough operator rather than a simple PR man, and it makes money. In one sense, Branson looks shrewd in having cut the deal to sell a 49 per cent stake to Singapore in 1999 for \u00a3600m. Singapore might want to sell, but, regardless of who buys in, Branson remains the majority holder. He is rumoured to be considering buying in the stake himself. But although he would have control, his life could be made less comfortable if Singapore sold to one of the private equity houses, such as TPG, which have been sniffing around airlines from Qantas in Australia to Iberia in Spain. &apos;Private equity may look at this and think there are assets that could be leveraged,&apos; says an analyst. &apos;They could try and do something with Branson&apos;s Heathrow slots [he has some 2 per cent of the total take-off and landing slots at the airport which, at times of strong demand, can change hands for around \u00a320m a pair] or look closely at the fleet.&apos; Also, increased transatlantic competition at Heathrow, with several US carriers looking to shift operations there from Gatwick, poses a question over the future. But analysts do not expect change to come quickly at Heathrow, threatening the transatlantic market leaders - Virgin, BA, American and United. &apos;Heathrow is effectively full, so it isn&apos;t clear how much will change in the short term,&apos; says one analyst. &apos;The main problem is national ownership rules. Virgin has to remain majority UK-owned if it is to continue operating out of Heathrow. Singapore has not made it work. If they can&apos;t, who wants a minority stake?&apos; At present Virgin Atlantic is performing well: profits for the year to February 2006 rose to \u00a360m from \u00a340m the year before. In the longer run, there may be one-off opportunities to expand. If Sir Michael Bishop, owner of BMI, which has 11.5 per cent of slots at Heathrow, were to exercise an option to sell to Lufthansa, the German carrier might do a deal with Virgin, giving Singapore an exit route, Branson a new partner, and a major increase in his capacity. Branson&apos;s media adventure, however, presents different problems. Formed when he sold Virgin Mobile for \u00a3800m and a 10 per cent stake in a combination with cable operator NTL, it has been fighting it out with BSkyB ever since. This year Murdoch&apos;s group withheld channels that were supposed to be accessible via Virgin in a dispute over price. As with the Singapore situation, Branson himself could enhance his reputation as a shrewd operator if an \u00a311bn deal with Carlyle materialises. His stake would have increased from \u00a3420m on the NTL deal to \u00a3577m. But there would be a cost too. It would be another example of a company that has not delivered cash, and has provided customers with an equivocal view of the Virgin brand. Nomura analyst Martin Mabbutt says: &apos;I would have thought this would be a pretty poor reflection on Virgin.&apos; Mabbutt points out that NTL and Telewest, the companies that formed NTL, had never made money and suffered reputations for poor customer service. In addition, he is sceptical of the proposition behind Virgin media - a &apos;quad play&apos; offering of TV, broadband, home phone and mobile. &apos;Mobile [the part Branson brought along] doesn&apos;t fit. The other three services are all household things, but mobile is a personal product.&apos; If the trains experience is anything to go by, the Virgin brand is strong enough to weather the odd knock. Branson has always had an ambition to get into TV, but, while it is early days, Carlyle is rumoured to be considering dropping the Virgin brand if it goes through with a deal. Branson is worth a reputed \u00a34bn, so that \u00a3157m may be scant compensation for being unplugged from TV. Nevertheless, Barwise does not think Branson is finished: &apos;He has a very valuable brand, closely associated with him. He seems as engaged as ever - and has come through bad periods before.&apos; The Virgin Story 1969 Richard Branson sets up Virgin mail order record business.

Nick Dougherty, the sweet-faced young pin-up of the Golf Punk gang, was deep in unfamiliar territory and looked as if he knew that Woods was ready to do real damage. &quot;I felt extremely nervous alongside Tiger,&quot; Dougherty recalls. &quot;The crowd was very loud and when I went to tee up my first ball I was shaking. I tried to play as solid a shot as I could in the circumstances. But it was anything but solid. It went way off to the left and someone shouted: &apos;This guy is gonna shoot 89 today&apos;.&quot; Eighteen hours earlier Dougherty had felt very different. His dejection after a second-round 77, following the 68 which had taken him to the top of the leaderboard at the end of the first day, gave way to elation. &quot;I&apos;d been so disappointed with my round that afterwards, in the courtesy car, I said to my manager, &apos;Aw, just give &apos;em a call and find out what time I&apos;m playing tomorrow.&apos; So he called them up and all he said was: &apos;2:05, Tiger Woods&apos;. I was so excited I almost punched a hole in the roof of the car. It changed the whole complexion of the day because it was definitely worth shooting seven over to get to play with Tiger in the third round of a major.&quot; Dougherty has played some of the best golf of his career this year but the fact that he has led nine tournaments without winning a single event is held up as proof of his mental frailty. His testing encounter with Woods threatened to expose him still further as a talented and marketable player rather than a serious contender at the highest level of the game. &quot;If ever there was a time I was going to crack psychologically then it was going to be in that third round at Oakmont,&quot; he counters. &quot;But I didn&apos;t. My round with Tiger showed that any psychological hurdles I&apos;ve got to get over have nothing to do with me being frightened of the big occasion. It was an honour and a privilege and it ended up being one of the most enjoyable days of my life so far. &quot;It also gave me a lot of confidence because I was determined to go out there and get his respect. And I did myself proud, even if I wasn&apos;t hitting the ball as well as I would&apos;ve liked. I held myself together fantastically well for most of the day because my course management was very good and that&apos;s what&apos;s key in these majors, especially the US Open, where the course is so tough that if you miss a fairway you&apos;re staring down the barrel of a double-bogey. &quot;I had a chance of getting within one shot of him by the time we got to the 14th and I was really pleased because that day, as some commentators said afterwards, Tiger probably played his best round so far this year. But it was gut-wrenching to finish the way I did - with a bogey at 15, which was understandable because it&apos;s such a tough hole, and then a double-bogey at 17 and again at the last. I ended up being four over which was at least three shots worse than I should&apos;ve been. But it was a great learning experience.&quot; In standing up to Woods for most of that round, and going on to finish seventh, his first top-10 place in a major, Dougherty gave fresh hope to those who have long claimed that he has the ability to match the likes of Justin Rose and Paul Casey. His two countrymen finished a shot further back at Oakmont, to share a tie for 10th, but Dougherty believes the lessons gleaned in close-up from Woods will help him - in particular this week in the Open at Carnoustie. &quot;I&apos;m going to Carnoustie in a terrific frame of mind. I learnt so much from that third round but the things I liked most about Tiger were his composure and his will. Even when he was two under early in his round he was pushing so hard. He had a putt to go three under but it was very tough and it grazed the edge of the hole. The pain in his face was incredible. Even though it was a 20-footer, with about three feet of break in it, Tiger looked absolutely insulted that it hadn&apos;t gone in. I thought that was marvellous. &quot;People go to Oakmont and Carnoustie, which can feel barbaric at their toughest, and they say it&apos;s best to try and make par every hole. The odd birdie is meant to be a massive bonus. But Tiger was trying to birdie every hole. It was also really interesting to watch how he maintained his composure all through the round. I noticed how slowly he walks between shots and, also, how he controls his breathing so effectively. I&apos;ve been doing these breathing exercises with a programme called HeartMath, and it&apos;s real groundbreaking stuff which scientists over here are doing with the government, but I looked at Tiger and thought: &apos;Christ, he&apos;s been doing this all along.&apos; Ever since he was a young kid he has been working on his breathing - it&apos;s typical Tiger being 10 years ahead. &quot;But for me HeartMath is new and amazing. It allows you to use your breathing to get into &apos;the zone&apos; - which is basically reaching that level of heart rate where we perform best. It does wonders out on the golf course and it works fabulously for jet lag and a whole lot of other things . . .&quot; &quot;Including sex?&quot; I wonder, in a nod to his old girl-getting persona. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he marvels, &quot;it&apos;s huge. Absolutely huge.&quot; But to underline his post-Tiger seriousness, Dougherty stresses how breathing and positivity are even more pertinent when set against the rigorous backdrop of Carnoustie. &quot;Like Oakmont, this is a course that really suits me. I&apos;ve played it many times during the Dunhill [Links Championship] and I&apos;ve never shot worse than level par. I really like the layout because it&apos;s not one of those links courses you feel you get too many bad breaks on either. It&apos;s pretty much as you see it and you can generally land on the greens and the ball will stop within reason. I like that.&quot; That phrase was not in much use during the 1999 Open at Carnoustie when Paul Lawrie became the last European to win a major. Dougherty, who has just turned 25, was far too young to play that year but remembers watching on television. &quot;The weather beforehand was not great and it produced brutal rough. It was far too thick and the difficulty of the course went over the top. This year they&apos;re going to err on the side of caution and it&apos;s going to be set up far easier than they&apos;d probably like it. But it&apos;s a great golf course.&quot; As he has blown so many leads this year it seems cruel to ask Dougherty if he has a chance of winning on Sunday. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says quietly, &quot;I believe I can win. That&apos;s all I need. I don&apos;t need to push it any further because as long as I believe I can then I have a real chance. That&apos;s how I approached the US Open. I thought I could maybe win beforehand but I certainly didn&apos;t expect to. I was free from pressure. &quot;The problem I&apos;ve had this year is that I believe I should now be winning European events regularly. I&apos;ve got into a situation where, rather than just playing my game, I&apos;ve gone into final rounds bossing myself around and saying &apos;I have to win this!&apos; &quot;The toughest one was the Italian Open [in May] because going into the back nine I thought: &apos;Christ, this is mine to lose now. If you don&apos;t win this then you&apos;re a right plank and a plonker.&apos; I was three shots clear and playing fantastically. But suddenly golf became very difficult and things that had been coming easy were a real strain. It was all down to me buckling under self-imposed pressure. But at least I understand it - and that&apos;s the first step to getting over it.&quot; Significantly, Dougherty&apos;s only victory on tour, at the Singapore Masters in 2005, &quot;was not one I really expected to win. In the end I won by five shots but I played the last 36 holes with Colin Montgomerie and Thomas Bjorn and didn&apos;t drop a shot. So that showed I have the mentality for the big occasion. Oakmont with Tiger confirmed it. &quot;So I&apos;m going into Carnoustie with a lot of optimism because that&apos;s the only way you&apos;re going to get a sniff of victory. But I&apos;m also not putting myself under any pressure. I&apos;m aiming to play as well as I can through the first two rounds and then maybe, just maybe, I&apos;ll get another look at Tiger on the weekend.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/20/sport.golf", "sentences": ["The programme for London 2012 is confirmed but two sports will be added for the 2016 summer Games and the IOC has pledged to reform the shambolic process used in Singapore in 2005.", "This resulted in no sports being added and many of the contenders leaving Singapore feeling hard done by."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-20T00:37:46Z", "title": "Digger: Golf makes a pitch for inclusion in Olympics", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Golf", "The Open 2007", "The Open"], "article": "The Royal and Ancient is to launch a concerted campaign to get golf into the Olympics, after receiving assurances from the International Olympic Committee that it will receive a fair hearing when the programme is reviewed in 2009.

Brown, a member of the R&amp;A rules committee, told jokes about &quot;Nips&quot; and disabled people in a speech to the Association of Golf Writers&apos; annual dinner on Tuesday. The speech caused huge embarrassment to the club, featuring on the front page of some papers in Scotland.

Whereas visitors have to pay \u00a3135 for 18 holes on the toughest course on the Open rota, some members pay less than \u00a3300 a year for unlimited rounds. The members also enjoy some of the best seats in Carnoustie for the tournament, with their various clubhouses lining Links Road parallel with the 18th fairway. Payne in line for R&amp;A The chairman of the Augusta National, Billy Payne, is on the shortlist for membership of the only club in golf more exclusive than his. Payne is believed to have made the American waiting list for entry to the R&amp;A, and can expect to get in far quicker than those biding their time on this side of the Atlantic. McIlroy in demand Among those smiling at Rory McIlroy&apos;s stellar opening round was the agent Chubby Chandler, who already counts Darren Clarke and Ernie Els among his clients. Chandler is hopeful of recruiting McIlroy to his ISM stable and taking charge of his move into the professional ranks. The Walker Cup will be staged at Royal County Down near his home in September, and it is inconceivable now that he will not make the squad.

Publication of the 142-page transcript has fuelled growing concerns over the apparent lack of evidence against Mohammed Haneef, a 27-year-old Indian doctor who was arrested in Australia as he was about to board a flight to Bangalore on Monday July 2, two days after the failed car bomb attacks in London and Scotland. In police affidavits filed with a court in Brisbane, officers stated that throughout two days of questioning Dr Haneef gave no explanation as to why his ticket to India was one way. But in the interview transcripts Dr Haneef, who has been charged with providing support to a terrorist organisation, told officers he was flying to Bangalore via Singapore to see his wife and new baby, who had just been born by caesarean section. He said his father-in-law bought him the single ticket and he was planning to buy his return ticket in Bangalore with his own money. The doctor also gave a full explanation of why he had given his mobile phone Sim card over a year ago to Sabeel Ahmed, one of the men subsequently charged in Britain in connection with the attacks. He said he and Dr Ahmed, who are second cousins, were living together in the UK while studying medicine. When in July last year Dr Haneef finished his contract at the Royal Liverpool hospital his Sim card still had a month of time on the contract. Dr Ahmed asked for the card, saying he would transfer the registration to his own name when the contract expired, he says in the transcript. Dr Ahmed was charged last week in London with having information that might have prevented the attacks. Revelations from the transcripts come as a former chairman of the National Crime Authority in Australia condemned the police investigation into Haneef&apos;s alleged part in the plot as &quot;incompetent&quot;. Peter Faris, a barrister, told the Australian newspaper: &quot;I think this is fast approaching the situation where there is not a reasonable prospect of a conviction unless there&apos;s some other evidence that we don&apos;t know about.&quot; Dr Haneef, who left the UK last summer to work as a registrar at the Gold Coast hospital, was arrested by police at Brisbane airport on Monday July 2 as he allegedly attempted to leave the country on a one-way ticket. A 50-page government dossier outlining the case against Dr Haneef released in Sydney claims that he had been in regular contact with his cousins, Sabeel and Kafeel Ahmed, who are both in custody in Britain. But in the interview Dr Haneef told how he had made repeated attempts to contact anti-terrorist police in Britain to explain his connections to the Ahmeds after the failed bomb attacks. He said he had received a telephone call from Dr Ahmed&apos;s mother on Saturday June 30 saying that her son had been arrested and the police wanted to talk to Dr Haneef. She gave Dr Haneef the police officer&apos;s number and name. He told Australian police he tried four times to contact the officer, but his calls were unanswered. In London yesterday the fourth person to be charged in connection with the failed car bomb attacks appeared in court. Mohammed Jamil Asha, 26, who is also a doctor, was remanded in custody after appearing at City of Westminster magistrates court. He is accused of conspiring with Bilal Abdullah, Kafeel Ahmed and &quot;others unknown&quot; to cause explosions. Dr Asha, from Newcastle under Lyme, is due to appear at the Old Bailey on July 27.

It was his general manager in Phuket. &apos;He said: &quot;There is this huge wave coming!&quot; Then there was silence,&apos; Ho recalls. Ho turned on the BBC but found that news of the Asian tsunami was yet to break. Then the phone rang again. It was his GM in Sri Lanka. He told the same story - a huge wave, heading his way, about to hit. It was not looking good for Ho, whose properties were dotted across the Indian Ocean. The next call came from the Maldives; more followed. By the time the tsunami had passed, nine of Banyan Tree&apos;s 20 or so resorts had been struck. Although Ho was insured, the wave had longer-term consequences for his company: the year following the tsunami &apos;we suffered because nobody came&apos;, he says. In that year occupancy rates dropped from a typical 70 per cent to 20 per cent and Banyan Tree made a loss. Ho points out that since its foundation in 1996, Banyan Tree has made a profit every year except 2005. Last year, Banyan Tree Holdings - which owns the 21 resorts, 58 spas and 68 &apos;retail galleries&apos; - was floated in Singapore. It was sold at Singapore for S$0.97 a share. The shares are now worth S$2.83; the market capitalisation is S$2.2bn (about \u00a3730m). That is the free float - Ho owns the remaining 50 per cent of the business. As you would expect given this background, Ho looks at home in the Savoy, where he holds court on his frequent visits from his Singapore base to London (though he stays in a flat nearby). He cuts a suave figure in suit and open-necked shirt, talking on a range of subjects from the pros and cons of colonialism and the legacy of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore to the impact that the travel industry is making on the environment. Ho lapses into marketing-speak when he describes what has made Banyan Tree successful. &apos;If I can get you to go with your partner to a Banyan Tree you have created memories of your own there. It is an emotional response you will remember forever.&apos; It is hard to listen to, but he probably has a point. He means that Banyan Tree resorts do not aim to offer plain luxury. Ho says, for example, that there is no point in giving solid silver cutlery where plate will do. People go for the locations, and the feeling of being away from everything. Ho, who started out in a Chinese trading family in Singapore, has become one of south east Asia&apos;s most prominent entrepreneurs. He studied at Stanford University but was suspended for joining a protest against the Vietnam War in 1972, when he was 20, and did not graduate. He continued his studies at the University of Singapore and now notes, sardonically, that Stanford has him as an alumnus &apos;for fundraising purposes&apos;. He moved on to work as a journalist on the Far Eastern Economic Review until 1981, when he joined to the family business, which he describes as a &apos;typical mini overseas Chinese conglomerate&apos;. Ho&apos;s family was part of the diaspora that has built up in south east Asia through emigration over the past two centuries. He is straightforward about the reputation the Chinese have in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. &apos;The Chinese were ethnically quite distinct from the rest of the population. They were called the Jews of south east Asia. Over a long period of time they became very wealthy.&apos; However, despite decades of apparent success, Ho believed that by the 1980s the typical overseas Chinese business model was outdated. His diagnosis of why the &apos;mini overseas Chinese conglomerate&apos; was failing fixed in his own mind that he was going to leave the family firm, and determined the kind of business he would set up when he did. He says: &apos;The overseas Chinese business model - as most of them were engineered in the Seventies - was in trying to be the lowest-cost producer in terms of contract manufacturing for Western companies. In our family business, we did TVs for Mitsui, shoes for Nike, engineering, construction. We had businesses in Singapore, we had a business in Thailand and so on. The essential weakness of that model is that cost competitiveness is only a comparative advantage. When cheaper countries come in you are running to keep up.&apos; In the early Nineties, Ho had the jolt that made him change course. &apos;I had a real wake-up call. There was a business I started that was a sneaker contract manufacturer. It started in Thailand and in 12 months I closed it down. Indonesia was making sneakers more cheaply.&apos; The question then was what to do next. Ho says: &apos;I thought about it and realised there were two kinds of [business] advantage. There is competitive advantage, but that is comparative, and there is proprietary advantage. There are two kinds of this: technology - I am not technological - or there is a brand. &apos;I made the decision to build a proprietary brand and I was casting around looking for a candidate.&apos; Banyan Tree, in other words, started as a brand in search of a business. So why hotels? The choice was a &apos;fluke&apos;, says Ho. It transpires that in the Eighties, Ho and his brother had invested in land in Phuket, which they subsequently found to be partly contaminated as it was the site of an old tin mine. Nevertheless, he and his brother built several hotels there managed by other groups - Sheraton and Dusit, the Thai group, for example. Ho believed that there was space at the very top of the market for places that gave the &apos;emotional&apos; response he likes to describe. So he started Banyan Tree in 1996. More than a decade on, Ho believes that the business is secure because the brand is strong, not just in Asia but across the world. He says a third of customers come from north Asia - Japan, Korea and China - a third from Europe and the US and a third from the rest of the world. The next big geographical push will be to expand its presence in China. Ho says: &apos;We are in the process of starting our own private equity fund. We are raising $500-700m from institutional investors that we would use to add to our existing hotels in China. The fund will be used to develop properties in China, exiting in five to eight years&apos; time. [Eventually] the properties would have full management agreements with Banyan Tree.&apos; His ambition is to keep the business growing.

The deal would allow Barclays to increase its \u00a345bn offer for ABN and include more cash in the deal. It is understood that if Barclays acquires ABN, the Chinese state would be sold a stake of about 7% in the enlarged British group. A smaller holding of about 3% would be held by Temasek, the investment arm of the Singapore government. The BBC said that it believed Barclays would increase its offer to \u00a350bn, beating a \u00a348bn bid from a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland. Barclays has come under intense pressure from ABN shareholders to increase its bid or risk losing to the RBS-led consortium. But it has struggled to reconcile this demand with fears expressed by its own shareholders that already it is overpaying for the Dutch bank. Some Barclays shareholders may also be concerned that the bank will offer a stake to the Chinese government without first giving a rights option to existing shareholders. Barclays has been in talks with ABN since last year, and made an all-share offer to buy ABN this year. Dutch regulators have given the bank two weeks to table a formal offer. Last week RBS said it would increase the cash element of its offer to 93%, strengthening its hand in the bidding war. The rival British consortium issued its formal offer on Friday in an attempt to trump Barclays, which many commentators have said has nowhere to turn for extra cash without upsetting its own shareholders. The deal with the two Asian governments was arranged by the US private equity house, Blackstone, which recently floated on the New York stock exchange and in the process sold a \u00a31.5bn stake in itself to the Chinese state. If Barclays fails to buy ABN, the newly formed Chinese investment authority and Temasek would take smaller stakes in the British bank, the BBC said. The Chinese and the Singapore government are understood to be paying about 740p for each Barclays share, above its closing market price on Friday of 713.5p. Like many cash-rich foreign governments, China has signalled its intention to make long term investments in major western economies.

Barclays announced this morning that China Development Bank is spending \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.5bn) on a 3.1% stake. It has also agreed to raise its investment to \u20ac9.8bn if Barclay&apos;s attempt to buy ABN Amro succeeds.   This would be the biggest foreign investment even made by a Chinese company, beatng  the \u00a31.5bn stake China&apos;s government bought in private equity firm Blackstone in May.   The two companies have also formed a strategic partnership. Chief executive John Varley claimed that the deal would help Barclays grow its business in Asia.   &quot;This is a significant step that provides Barclays with unprecedented access to the Chinese financial market, and to Chinese companies as they grow their operations around the world,&quot; said Mr Varley.   &quot;Our strategy has been to rapidly grow our profits by targeting areas of future grow, and this deal will help create the conditions for us to succeed.&quot;   Bob Diamond, chief executive of Barclays Capital, explained that Barclays has over 1,000 branches in Africa, and that many Chinese firms want to strengthen their banking links with the continent.   Temasek, the investment arm of the Singapore government, is buying a \u20ac1.4bn stake, which will rise to \u20ac3.6bn if the ABN Amro deal goes through.   Selling these two stakes has enabled Barclays to make an improved takeover offer for ABN Amro, the Dutch bank which it has been doggedly pursuing for months.   It has raised its offer for the Dutch bank to \u20ac67.5bn, with \u20ac24.8bn in cash and the remainder in shares.   This is a \u20ac4.5bn increase on the deal Barclays  agreed with ABN Amro in April.   Mr Varley also denied that Barclays was offering less value to ABN shareholders than the rival consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland.   Its offer of \u20ac13.15 a share in cash and 2.13 Barclays shares for each ABN Amro share is currently worth \u20ac35.73 per ABN Amro share.   Last week the RBS consortium offered \u20ac38.50 a share, with 93% in cash.   &quot;It&apos;s too early to say that their offer is higher,&quot; insisted Mr Varley, pointing out that Barclays share price may have risen sharply by September when ABN shareholders will vote.   He admitted, though, that today&apos;s offer does not yet have the support of the Dutch bank&apos;s board.   &quot;They need time to see the share price consequences of today&apos;s news,&quot; Mr Varley explained, adding that &quot;we hope and expect&quot; to have their recommendation by the time the offer terms are sent to shareholders next month.   ABN Amro said this morning that it &quot;welcomes the opportunity for shareholders to consider two competing proposals on a level playing field&quot;. It also said that the alliance with China Development Bank would enhance the growth potential of a combined company.   Barclays shares were up 2.3% this afternoon, gaining 17p at 730.5p. ABN Amro shares were up \u20ac0.26 to \u20ac36.89.   Analysts pointed out that Barclays share price will have to reach around 790p before it is offering more money than RBS.

Barclays&apos; announcements yesterday were spectacular. The largest external investment by China is to take the form of shares in Barclays - that&apos;s a landmark deal, no doubt about it. A vote of confidence from Temasek also counts for a lot; the state-owned Singapore investment house has generated compound returns of 18% a year for 30 years and banking is the territory it knows best. To top it off, Barclays unveiled strong first-half figures, with earnings per share up 14%. Throw in the promise that a takeover of ABN Amro would yield greater savings than previously thought, and Barclays&apos; John Varley and Bob Diamond might have expected a roar of approval from the market. What they got was polite applause. The shares rose 21.5p, or 3%, to 735p. At that level, the see-through value of Barclays&apos; offer for ABN, which is still two-thirds in shares, is still more than 5% below the Royal Bank of Scotland consortium&apos;s rival offer. To get to equivalence, Barclays needs its own share price to be about 790p. You never know. There are two months still to run in the battle for ABN and Barclays&apos; Chinese deal could be a slow-burner; the applause could grow. At one level, it&apos;s a certainly a coup to persuade the Chinese to invest in a foreign bank. Arrangements have generally been the other around, with western banks expected to fork out a billion or so for thin slices of Chinese banks whose true level of bad debts is anybody&apos;s guess. We can probably assume, then, that China Development Bank is deadly serious about building a partnership with Barclays. It would be natural. China has been buying up the world&apos;s iron ore, copper and other commodities but hasn&apos;t been terribly canny in its execution. Expertise in areas such as risk management and procurement, courtesy of Barclays Capital, is needed. The good news for Barclays&apos; shareholders is that many of the advantages of the partnership are not dependent on landing ABN; that deal would merely bring greater strength in dull but important areas such as cross-border cash processing, a speciality of the Dutch. But it also would be wrong to paint the Chinese as financial amateurs. They are paying 720p a share for their first tranche of Barclays stock, and 740p for the second if the ABN deal happens. They are not (at least for another couple of years) investing at 780p, a price which if paid now, would have put a rocket under Barclays&apos; share price and given RBS a serious headache. In that sense, the market&apos;s modest reaction to Barclays&apos; news was rational. If the bank&apos;s new friends are investing at 720p and 740p, why would others want to pay more? So the sunny uplands of 790p-800p may continue to be distant. None of which undermines the fact that Barclays produced yesterday an elegant way to breathe life into its bid for ABN, which looked dead last Friday. We have a contest again, even if RBS &amp; Co are still favourites. But the real significance of yesterday may not lie in who ends up owning ABN. A state-owned Chinese bank has just made a sizeable investment in Barclays, a pillar of the UK financial establishment, and has been guaranteed a representative on the main board. In time, its ownership could grow even further: the agreement limits China Development Bank to a holding of 10% for three years. What happens then? Nothing in yesterday&apos;s documents prevents a full bid. That idea might seem fanciful now, but will it in three years&apos; time? The Chinese have embarked on a course of investing their foreign reserves overseas. Given the size of the sums, there is no way of telling where it might lead. The Chinese have certainly been cute in cultivating friends. An important broker in the Barclays investment appears to have been Blackstone, the enormous US private equity house in which China recently invested $3bn. At some point, it is surely inevitable that China&apos;s ambition to own assets overseas is going to inflame politicians and regulators in the west. It has already happened in the US, where two years ago a Chinese oil company abandoned plans to buy Unocal after Congress demanded that the plan be dropped. US politicians insisted that China open up its economy and get serious about protecting intellectual property rights. In the US, the row over an oil company was framed as a question of national security. Are banks so different? The investment in Barclays is not big enough to demand an immediate answer, but the question will have to be addressed soon. Yesterday showed the speed at which global financial power has shifted eastwards. Barclays could have chosen any number of western investors, but China and Singapore got the gig. It won&apos;t be the end of the story. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/25/horseracing.sport1", "sentences": ["In the eastern time zones, agreement has been reached to take British racing into Singapore, while in Australia, the Sky channel will add two British meetings every Thursday to the two it currently broadcasts every Saturday."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-24T23:37:33Z", "title": "Horse racing: Jockeys face 18-month ban if caught passing information for reward", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Jockeys and trainers who profit from privileged information can expect to be banned from racing for at least 18 months, following confirmation by the Horseracing Regulatory Authority yesterday of increased penalties for selling inside knowledge about a horse&apos;s chances. Licensed individuals who break the rules will also face complete disqualification from the sport, meaning that they cannot work in racing in any capacity, rather than the less severe penalty of the suspension of their licence. In recent months, a number of jockeys, including Robert Winston, Tony Culhane and Shane Kelly, have been suspended for between four months and a year for passing information for reward. Under the new regime a single breach of the rule - one involving information about one horse or one race - will incur a disqualification of between nine months and five years, with an &quot;entry point&quot;, the &quot;penalty for a single, average type of offence&quot; set at 18 months. At present, the entry point is nine months, with a range of three months to three years. However, most cases brought under Rule 243, which was introduced in 2003, involve multiple races. This means that in practice, the ban for such offences could be a great deal longer than 18 months, since the disciplinary panel will have the ability to impose several bans to run consecutively. &quot;It is important for people to realise that the entry point is for one offence, and that penalties can be aggregated,&quot; Paul Scotney, the HRA&apos;s head of security, said yesterday. &quot;Anyone caught passing information for reward is now likely to be warned off for a substantial period of time, and it will be complete disqualification, not suspension. &quot;Any case of the sort we have seen recently would now result in very long bans, and there will no longer be the option to carry on working in the sport. &quot;I think that we are justified in doing this now. We have made it clear what inside information is, and we have set the mark in the sand. There is no excuse for anyone any longer and there is now a very good chance that anyone who breaks this rule will be caught.&quot; The new rules would also prevent jockeys who have been banned from claiming injury payments from the riders&apos; insurance scheme. Culhane, who is currently injured, was suspended for a year for a breach of Rule 243 earlier this month. He will continue to receive payments of \u00a31,370 per week from the Professional Riders&apos; Insurance Scheme, which is funded by a surcharge on riding fees paid by owners. Had he been disqualified rather than simply suspended, these payments would have been stopped. Owners and jockeys&apos; agents are also covered by Rule 243, with an identical penalty range and entry point to those for riders and trainers. Stable staff and service providers - blacksmiths, for example - face an entry point of 12 months&apos; disqualification, with a range of nine months to five years. &quot;We believe that preventing licensed and registered people who are guilty of this offence from any involvement in racing more accurately reflects the seriousness of the offence,&quot; Malcolm Wallace, the HRA&apos;s director of regulation, said. The integrity of British racing is an important selling point as the sport seeks to exploit betting markets around the world, and the Racing UK group of racecourses yesterday announced significant progress on three continents. In the eastern time zones, agreement has been reached to take British racing into Singapore, while in Australia, the Sky channel will add two British meetings every Thursday to the two it currently broadcasts every Saturday.

However in this case, we don&apos;t see any serious money taking the plunge until after the next profit warning.&quot; He described this potential warning as &quot;inevitable.&quot;   Jonathan Pritchard of Oriel Securities was no more enthusiastic. He said: &quot;Avoid. Analysts can have no confidence in their numbers and thus it is very difficult to construct an argument for what is fair value. Underlying this is the fact that the whole [business] model could be under threat. It&apos;s definitely one not to own and is probably, even at 150p, still one to short.&quot;   Among the major fallers today was insurance group Resolution, down 15p to 616p as it unveiled details of its \u00a38.6bn all share merger with rival Friends Provident, down 2.4p to 194.1p.   Power group British Energy led the way down, falling 26.5p to 482.5p after Goldman Sachs cut its price target from 574p to 570p and reduced its earnings per share forecasts for the next four years.   Goldman also did some damage to pubs group Punch Taverns. The company&apos;s shares lost 31p to \u00a312.25 as Goldman removed it from its &quot;conviction buy&quot; list. The bank said: &quot;Rising interest rates, combined with a lack of potential news flow in the near term, suggest that catalysts [for a share price rise] may be further away than previously hoped.   &quot;However we maintain our buy rating given the significant upside we see from the possibility of a transaction to realise property asset value, and from potential further deals by the company given its strong track record to date.&quot;   Speciality chemicals group Johnson Matthey fell another 35p to \u00a317.11. US regulators last night decided to delay for at least six months approval for a prostate cancer pill from GPC Biotech, from which Johnson is due to receive royalty and manufacturing income.   Consumer goods group Unilever slipped 5p to \u00a316.07 as Colgate-Palmolive - tipped as a merger partner for the Anglo-Dutch giant - said it there were no such conversations underway.   Barclays lost 23.5p to 715p after shareholders subscribed for only two-thirds of the shares on offer at 740p, as part of its proposal to buy ABN Amro. The shares came from those allocated to China Development Bank and Singapore&apos;s Temasek bank.   As for Glaxo, it added 29p to \u00a312.75 as it more than doubled its share buyback programme to \u00a312bn and reported second quarter sales of \u00a35.67bn, in line with analysts&apos; expectations.   Also on the way up was Northern Rock, 15p better at 817p after its half year results and a hike in the dividend. BT, up 5.75p to 328.25p, and Vodafone, 0.3p better at 156.3p, were wanted for their defensive qualities.   Vodafone also benefited from an upbeat note from Dresdner Kleinwort, which was particularly positive on the prospects for its mobile data business. The bank said good figures from Telecom Italia confirmed a trend in mobile data growth reported by Vodafone.   &quot;We find this highly supportive as mobile data is clearly becoming a sector-wide rather than Vodafone specific event,&quot; said the bank. &quot;As a pure-play with extensive 3G, Vodafone is best placed to benefit.&quot;   Elsewhere BAE Systems rose 4.75p to 435.25p as it unveiled its long awaited shipbuilding joint venture with VT Group, down 2.5p to 623p.   Among the mid-caps engineering group Renishaw jumped 84p to 684p despite a 14% fall in annual profits after it also said the outlook was better.   But Bluetooth specialist CSR fell 98p to 770.5p on disappointment about its third quarter revenue forecast.   Recruitment group Michael Page lost 30.p to 543p after rival Randstad issued a cautious outlook statement.   But a positive update from a smaller player in the sector, Greatfleet, saw its shares add 0.25p to 16.5p. Traders believe the company is also on the acquisition trail.   Finally Neteller, which specialises in processing payments for online companies, dropped 113p to 63p - a 64% decline - as its shares returned from suspension after a trading update. The company agreed last week to pay $136m (\u00a366.27m) to the US government under an agreement which will avoid the company being prosecuted for conspiracy. Neteller was one of the businesses caught up in the US clampdown on internet gaming, and will also pay back $94m to US customers.

In his first major speech as chancellor, Mr Darling highlighted how Britain has benefited from and continues to welcome inward investment and said it should not slide back to protectionist ways. He added that the UK should resist calls for a collective EU policy for vetting corporate acquisitions by foreign firms. The German chancellor Angela Merkel last week said she was in favour of adopting this US-style procedure saying: &quot;This is a new phenomenon which we much tackle with some urgency.&quot; Mr Darling&apos;s intervention came after a warning yesterday from deputy Bank of England governor, Sir John Gieve, that the global rise of state-backed funds would create political tension. The speech to the City follows news earlier this week that the China Development Bank and Singapore&apos;s Temasek are to take stakes in Barclays bank. And supermarket group J Sainsbury is on the receiving end of a \u00a310.4bn takeover approach from Delta Two, a sovereign wealth fund backed by the royal family of the oil-rich Gulf state, Qatar. Unions have urged the government to block the proposed Delta bid , arguing that it would be against the national interest. Sir John said yesterday: &quot;The switch of reserve-rich countries from lenders to owners of financial or real assets is also likely to lead to political tensions and pressure for protectionism.&quot; The International Monetary Fund and US government warned last month as well that the spread of these so-called &quot;sovereign funds&quot; could create new risks for the global financial system. While the UK chancellor praised inward investment he also criticised &quot;closed&quot; countries such as China by saying that investment must be a two way process - stressing that &quot;free trade should be just that&quot;. Sir John said yesterday: &quot;The switch of reserve-rich countries from lenders to owners of financial or real assets is also likely to lead to political tensions and pressure for protectionism.&quot; The International Monetary Fund and US government warned last month as well that the spread of these so-called &quot;sovereign funds&quot; could create new risks for the global financial system. While the UK chancellor will praise inward investment he will also criticise &quot;closed&quot; countries such as China by saying that investment must be a two way process - stressing that &quot;free trade should be just that&quot;.  Speaking on maintaining a stable economy, Mr Darling also warned that public-sector pay needed to be kept in line with inflation targets if inflation expectations were to be anchored down.   &quot;Public-sector pay settlements must be consistent with our inflation target,&quot; he said. &quot;I will support the Bank of England in any decision they take to meet the inflation target.&quot;   The Bank of England has already raised interest rates five times in the last year to a six-year high of 5.75% to try rein in rising inflation.   The chancellor&apos;s comments may be interpreted as the government giving the Bank the green light to tighten monetary policy further.   Meanwhile, the new finance minister said he was keen on continuing to simplify the tax system, a process begun in the last budget by his predecessor, Gordon Brown. Mr Darling said it was important to ensure that the UK&apos;s business tax rates and regime remained competitive.   He added that the pre-budget report, which will be published alongside the three-year spending review this autumn, was the place to address any changes to the tax system and treatment of private equity firms.   &quot;I&apos;ve made it absolutely clear that we need to be vigilant in relation to the tax system to make sure that there are not abuses, that if there are unfair loopholes ... that we need to deal with that,&quot; he said. &quot;The time to do that is within the context of the pre-budget report or the Budget itself.&quot; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/25/terrorism.australia", "sentences": ["He was about to board Singapore Airlines flight 246 on a one-way ticket back to India."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-25T22:45:38Z", "title": "The Australia connection", "tags": ["Australia news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "In a photograph taken a few months ago on the golden sands of Surfer&apos;s Paradise in Queensland, Australia, Mohammed Haneef is shown smiling, with a protective arm around his young pregnant wife. The 27-year-old had recently left behind the grey skies of Britain, where he had been working as a junior doctor, for a job with better prospects at a hospital on the sunshine-soaked Gold Coast - and he looks like a young man with plenty to look forward to. Today, any hopes Haneef may have had for the future are in tatters. In the wake of the failed car bombings in London and Glasgow last month, the Indian-born Muslim doctor - described by colleagues as &quot;quiet and hardworking&quot; - has been charged with supporting a terrorist organisation. A picture of him hunched in the back of a van, shoeless and wearing a prison jumpsuit, has been on the front page of every Australian newspaper, and he is now in jail, in solitary confinement. Despite the evidence against him being, at least on the face of it, weak and circumstantial, he is due to stand trial, and is almost certain to be deported whatever the outcome. Amid claims that the police have badly bungled the investigation, Haneef&apos;s case has highlighted disquiet about Australia&apos;s tough new anti-terror laws, led to a slanging match between rival politicians, and prompted many of the country&apos;s legal experts to attack the government for interfering in the process of justice. At first, the case against Haneef seemed simple enough. The second cousin of two of the car-bomb suspects in custody in Britain, Kafeel and Sabeel Ahmed, his name had been passed by Scotland Yard to Australian federal police within hours of a Jeep filled with petrol cans and gas canisters being rammed into the doors of Glasgow airport. Haneef was put under surveillance by the Australian authorities, and then arrested 47 hours after the Glasgow incident in the departure lounge at Brisbane International Airport. He was about to board Singapore Airlines flight 246 on a one-way ticket back to India. He claimed he was on his way home to see his wife, Firdous Arshiya, who had just given birth to their daughter there. The police suspected that his hasty departure was down to him having had some involvement, or knowledge of, the British terror plot, and 12 days later he was charged. At a magistrate&apos;s hearing to determine whether he should be allowed bail, the police revealed their case against him. A mobile phone Sim card that Haneef had left behind in the UK had been found in the burnt-out Jeep at Glasgow; he had admitted sharing a house in Liverpool with the two Ahmeds; and he had not given a satisfactory explanation of why he had suddenly decided to leave Australia. The bail application was expected to fail, but the magistrate, Jacqui Payne, was underwhelmed by the facts set out by police. Noting that there was no direct evidence linking the 27-year-old to the British attacks, she ordered that he be freed, but that his passport be confiscated and that he report regularly to police. The move took the government and the police, who had been expecting Haneef to stay in custody, by surprise. Later that day came the reaction: immigration minister Kevin Andrews said he was revoking Haneef&apos;s work visa on the grounds that he &quot;reasonably suspected&quot; that Haneef had been associating with persons involved in criminal conduct, namely terrorism, and that Haneef would remain in detention. Andrews also implied that there was a secret dossier of evidence against Haneef that was still being assessed and had not been made public for fear of compromising further investigations. There was uproar among Australia&apos;s legal fraternity. Lawyers and QCs lined up to accuse the government of an abuse of power and of interfering in the judiciary. The president of the Australian Bar Association, Stephen Estcourt QC, called the decision to override the magistrate&apos;s ruling &quot;a threat to the rule of law&quot; and added: &quot;It&apos;s very difficult for me to see how this could be anything more than a cynical use of power.&quot; Civil liberties groups said it would now be impossible for Haneef to get a fair trial. A leaked transcript of Haneef&apos;s interrogation in custody by his own lawyer, who said the public should know the extent of the case against his client, fuelled the controversy. In the manuscript, Haneef claimed that he had only social contact with his cousins; that his father-in-law had bought the air ticket to India for him because he had limited funds of his own; and also that he had tried four times to call British investigators when he heard that they had been looking for him to question him about the Sim card - a card that he had left in Britain with Sabeel Ahmed because there was still credit on it and it was useless to Haneef in Australia. Haneef denied any knowledge of the terrorist attack or his cousins&apos; part in it. He said he had never touched a gun or explosives in his life and would not take part in any form of jihad. All he wanted, he said, was to &quot;live life as a professionalist in the medical profession&quot;. He added: &quot;Every drop of blood is human and I feel for every human being.&quot; Since then the police case against Haneef appears to have become even shakier. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation revealed that his Sim card had not been found in the burnt-out Jeep - in fact it had been found many miles away in Sabeel Ahmed&apos;s house in Liverpool. More-over, Scotland Yard, which sent a senior officer to Brisbane to sit in on Haneef&apos;s interviews, does not apparently regard him as an important figure in the investigation. The messy saga has prompted Peter Beattie, the premier of Queensland and member of the opposition Labour party, to characterise the investigation, and the leaking to the press that has being going on, as like something out of the Keystone Kops. His remarks prompted an angry outburst from prime minister John Howard, who said the state premier was exploiting the row for political purposes. Supporters of the government have pointed out that the authorities are acting in the public interest at a time when the global threat of terrorism remains high, and that Haneef has been given consular and legal access. It has also been pointed out that Australia&apos;s anti-terror laws are less draconian than the UK&apos;s and those of other countries in Europe. Meanwhile, the Australian public, normally supportive of the government&apos;s tough stance on terrorism matters, is clamouring for a resolution, and civil liberties organisations are putting pressure on the government to reveal all the evidence it has against Haneef and to let the public make its own judgment about whether he is being fairly treated. Imran Siddiqui, a cousin of Haneef&apos;s wife, has come to Australia to support the doctor. He has yet to see the accused man because police are still running security checks on him, but hopes to visit the prison today or tomorrow. He says he has come to take Haneef home and that the whole family still has faith in the Australian justice system. &quot;We know the truth is that he is not connected to these things,&quot; he said at a press conference at the weekend. &quot;It&apos;s not wrong on my part to expect that he should be released with all respect and dignity.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/26/politics.economicpolicy", "sentences": ["This week the investment arms of the Chinese and Singaporean governments said they wanted to help bankroll the bid by Barclays for ABN Amro.", "Some countries, such as China and Singapore, have based their economic strategies on exports."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-25T23:18:16Z", "title": "Recipe for political tension", "tags": ["Business", "Politics", "Economic policy", "Sovereign wealth funds"], "article": "The rise of sovereign wealth funds underlines the changing balance of power in the global economy. Where once it was the west that exported capital to developing countries, for the past few years the trend has been reversed. It has been cash-rich governments in Asia that have allowed consumers in Britain and America to live beyond their means. Where once countries such as China were happy to snap up financial assets such as US Treasury bonds, they now seek to branch out and want to own or part-own western companies. This week the investment arms of the Chinese and Singaporean governments said they wanted to help bankroll the bid by Barclays for ABN Amro. Qatar&apos;s Delta (Two) fund put in a \u00a310.6bn bid approach for Sainsbury&apos;s this month. Some countries, such as China and Singapore, have based their economic strategies on exports. As the world&apos;s new industrial heartland, they sell more goods abroad than they import in return. In other words, they run trade surpluses, which stand in contrast to the trade deficits recorded by the UK and US. A second group of countries rich in natural resources - such as Russia and the oil states of the Gulf - have received a windfall from the commodity boom of the past few years. Those nations with ample stocks of crude are also running big trade surpluses. Countries such as China and Russia recycle their surpluses into the global economy. Until recently, they have bought western financial assets, and by buying bonds in massive quantities have forced down long-term interest rates, thereby encouraging still more consumption in the US and Britain by making borrowing cheaper. Now they are seeking to diversify their portfolios by buying up real assets - a strategy which ensures their activities are more visible and controversial. With the City dominating the UK economy, it was hardly surprising that Alistair Darling, below, should say that Britain was open to business from sovereign funds. Other countries are, however, more equivocal. Washington blocked a takeover by the Dubai government of terminal operations at six US ports. The funds have an estimated $2-2.5 trillion at their disposal, although Morgan Stanley believes this could rise to $12 trillion - the annual output of the US economy - in 10 years.

I know that at 8pm I will be seeing US experimentalists the Wooster Group making a rare UK appearance, performing La Didone. I&apos;ll also pop in to see Mark Ravenhill&apos;s new short play, one of 17 he&apos;ll be writing over a three-week period. I might take in the Andy Warhol exhibition or go to see Germaine Greer talk about her new book about Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare&apos;s wife, not the star of The Devil Wears Prada). I won&apos;t be missing comedian Russell Howard&apos;s new show, Adventures, because I&apos;m a big fan of the bendy-legged mop-head with the zippiest comic brain on the planet. If I could find the time, I&apos;d hear a recital by Evelyn Glennie or see choreographer William Forsythe&apos;s Impressing the Czar, which has won rave reviews in Europe. Oh, and I&apos;ll definitely be squeezing in The Arab &amp; the Jew, the latest piece from physical theatre troupe Gecko, and Chronicles of a Sleepless Moon, a junkyard comedy from Australia. Yes, it&apos;s nearly the time of Edinburgh and the world&apos;s biggest festival. Or rather, Edinburgh and its many festivals. What makes Edinburgh unique is the sheer range of activity and its scope: the high-art programme of the international festival is complemented by the ever growing Fringe with its mix of amateurs and professionals performing side by side, and street theatre and new writing set cheek by jowl with stand-up comics and sketch shows. Add in the book festival, the film festival, the Tattoo and the jazz and blues festival, and you have the world&apos;s biggest shindig - all in a gem of a city so small that you can pretty well walk everywhere. Some call it an unholy mishmash; I call it heaven. I can think of no other festival in the world where you can see quite such a range of culture in a single day, where high and low art, those just starting out on their careers and those at the very pinnacle, all rub shoulders. If the Fringe is the place for young practitioners to take risks - both financial and artistic - then Edinburgh in August is a place where audiences also stretch themselves. And it&apos;s not just their calf muscles that are getting the exercise. Last year, at a performance by the brilliant New York drag queen Taylor Mac, I sat next to an 80-year-old woman and her granddaughter. They had come to Edinburgh for the day to see a matinee of Peter Stein&apos;s Troilus and Cressida and had wandered - with the aid of a pin and a Fringe programme - into the Underbelly. Granny, who had never been to the Fringe before, rated Taylor Mac - quite rightly - far higher than the Stein. She wanted some tips on what else she should see because she was planning to come back later in the week. This serendipitous scenario is typical of Edinburgh in August, as audiences stumble across the new and unexpected and art forms escape their pigeonholes. It is one of the things that makes me love the festivals so much. Is Phill Jupitus and Andre Vincent&apos;s Waiting for Alice comedy or theatre? Will DO-Theatre&apos;s Hangman at Aurora Nova be more theatre than dance? Does it matter? In London, where audiences are distinct for different art forms, very probably. In Edinburgh, not one jot: you just dive in. One of the great strengths of Jonathan Mills&apos; first year as director of the international festival is a programme that links art forms both thematically, structurally and down the centuries. In the first week, you can catch L&apos;Orfeo, Monteverdi&apos;s experiment in uniting drama and music; in the last, you can see the American Repertory Theatre&apos;s Orpheus X, a contemporary piece of music theatre with Orpheus as a rock star on a trip to Hades. There are those who say that Edinburgh is no longer what it was, that you would never discover a young Tom Stoppard on the Fringe today. No, instead you can discover Gregory Burke, Dennis Kelly, Abi Morgan and Josie Long. This year, I&apos;m looking out for Joel Horwood; his Mikey the Pikey was a hit with a student group two years ago and he has now graduated to the Traverse programme with a play called Stoopud Fucken Animals. You can watch entire careers develop at Edinburgh - whether those of playwrights, comics, directors (think John Tiffany, with shows from Perfect Days to Black Watch, who this year gets a crack at the international festival with The Bacchae) or even producers such as James Seabright, Underbelly founders Ed Bartlam and Charlie Wood, and Kate McGrath and Louise Blackwell of Fuel. It was the Edinburgh festivals, with their many spaces and venues, rather than the English National Theatre, that provided an alternative model for the hugely successful National Theatre of Scotland, a &quot;theatre without walls&quot;. Of course, the world is a very different place than it was 61 years ago, when Rudolph Bing conceived an international arts festival that would rise from the ashes of postwar Europe. In those days, air travel was limited and festivals a rarity. Now you can easily hop on a plane to see your favourite orchestra in Europe, visits by international companies to the UK are frequent, and the &quot;festivalisation&quot; of culture mean that you can now go to a festival somewhere in the UK every single week of the year. You don&apos;t have to wait until August and Edinburgh. Manchester is the latest to join a growing international festival circuit that includes other newcomers such as Singapore and Abu Dhabi, who have bigger budgets than Edinburgh and better transport infrastructures. They are also not lumbered with a city council that seems strangely ambivalent about its annual party, despite the fact that the festivals generate around \u00a3180m for the Scottish economy. Edinburgh&apos;s relationship with the festival was summed up a few years back by comic Jeff Innocent, who declared: &quot;The locals react to the festival like a hardened docker with a rather camp gay son.&quot; That camp gay son has done rather well for himself, even if his docker dad has done very little to help him on his way. A report published last year by the Scottish Arts Council argued that with the competition galloping up fast behind, Edinburgh needed massive investment to stay ahead in the game. A consortium of Fringe venue mangers are so concerned by the lack of national and international marketing of the festival that last year they toyed with the idea of selling the Fringe on eBay to the highest bidder to raise awareness, arguing that Edinburgh is in danger of becoming a local event. Almost 70% of the 1.5m tickets sold on the Fringe are sold to people who live in Scotland. Certainly there is work to be done. Edinburgh could do a great deal to help itself, not least in encouraging more people to visit the festival by seeking better transport links with Glasgow and the surrounding areas and founding a tented city for the duration that would allow young people to camp. It was done for the G8, so why not for the festival? The city and Scotland need to recognise that when Rudolph Bing alighted on Edinburgh as the location for the festival, they had a great big juicy plum dropped into their lap. If they want to continue to reap the benefits, they must be prepared to make an investment in the festivals&apos; future. For the time being, though, Edinburgh is still far ahead of the pack. During Manchester&apos;s first international festival, you had no sense walking around the city of a festival in full swing. Other attempts to replicate Edinburgh all over the world - from Montreal to New York, Dublin to Melbourne - have always been a bit of a damp squib. There is just not the same buzz. That&apos;s because the festivals that have sprung up alongside the Edinburgh international festival have done so organically over a long period, and they are constantly evolving. For years, the doom merchants have been predicting the Edinburgh festivals&apos; imminent demise. They will continue wailing, while I and thousands of other performers and punters will continue to flock there, because there is nothing else like Edinburgh: it really is the greatest show on earth."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/27/motoring.lifeandhealth", "sentences": ["The company is also considering its options for a new assembly and test facility, with the choice between Singapore or the US."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-27T16:34:55Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce hopeful despite weak dollar", "tags": ["Business", "Life and style", "Rolls-Royce", "Automotive industry", "Pendragon"], "article": "The engine maker Rolls-Royce said yesterday it expected higher underlying profits this year, despite the impact of the weaker dollar and rising raw material costs. Rolls-Royce said the weakness of the US currency had cost some \u00a340m in the first half of the year but underlying profits had still risen 17% to \u00a3380m. Sales rose to almost \u00a33.6bn while the order book increased by more than a third to \u00a335.1bn, with much of that coming from the civil aerospace sector.

Sir John Rose, the chief executive, said the group had made strong progress over the first six months. &quot;We have a well-balanced business with a broad portfolio of products and services and proven access to global markets. &quot;Despite the challenges of increasing raw material costs and the effects of a weakening dollar, the group is well placed to deliver growth in underlying profit and, before pension scheme injections, a positive cash flow in 2007.&quot; As well as its civil engine business Rolls-Royce also supplies the defence and marine markets, and builds turbines for the energy industry. Rolls-Royce said it had brought in three new engine programmes over the last six months - one for a business jet, the Dassault Falcon, another for the Airbus A350 XWB, and the third for the Robinson helicopter - which will give it access to a market which it believes will be worth $200bn (\u00a397bn) over the next 20 years. The company is also considering its options for a new assembly and test facility, with the choice between Singapore or the US. In Britain the company is close to completing its factory modernisation programme, with facilities at Derby and Bristol expected to come into operation by the end of the year. The company paid \u00a3132m into its UK pension schemes in the first half of the year and said it would put in a further \u00a3368m over the next six months. Analysts at Numis said that the results were slightly ahead of consensus forecasts and Rolls-Royce &quot;remains a very attractive long-term story&quot;. The strong aerospace sector also helped Boeing to record profits of more than $1bn for the last quarter, easily beating Wall Street&apos;s expectations.

I was sitting in a stuffy office at my soon-to-be publisher, on a baking summer&apos;s day. I had left my three-week-old baby at home with his dad and a bottle of expressed breast milk, and as King&apos;s Cross was shut, had walked all the way from Euston in the heat of the full sun. On arrival, I listened with astonishment as a roomful of enthusiastic publishing types told me how much they loved my first novel, which is about three generations of a Bengali/Pakistani family whose relationships are defined and compromised by deceit. And then the obvious question came. I knew the answer, and although I wanted to lie, I was too stunned to come up with something convincing at such short notice. So I told them the truth. I explained that my personal interest in the impact of deception on families - all those uncomfortable facts that are swept under the carpet and ignored for the common good, all the inventive lies that we use to comfort and conceal - was due to my father, a charmingly unrepentant rogue who found telling the truth rather dull, as though it somehow lacked imagination. Other people telling the truth landed him in jail on more than one occasion and in more than one country. This continued well into his 60s, when he should have known better. The last time I remember was when he sold someone a boat in Paris - which wouldn&apos;t have got him arrested, except the boat wasn&apos;t his. Every family has a black sheep, and in mine, it was my dad. It was confusing, as he was also the most admired by far; he was the eldest son (which was why his family nickname was Sonny), with a staggering IQ and had gone to Stanford University to study for his Masters at the tender age of 19. He spoke several languages (English, French, German, Urdu, his native Punjabi and even some Spanish and Arabic) and made vast sums of money as an entrepreneur. He frequented high society in various countries, and was on first-name terms with the sort of people who appeared on the pages of Tatler, such as James Goldsmith and John Aspinall. He even wrote novels that were well reviewed. Faces of Love and Death was described as a &quot;work of talent&quot; by the British press; Snakes and Ladders was described as &quot;a daring and outspoken excursion into the life of the [Pakistani] bourgeoisie as it messily cuts its own throat&quot;. And even after years of erratic misbehaviour, during which he had abandoned his family, bankrupted himself and a few others along the way, and carried on a cheerful nomadic existence in various hotels around the world, from Atlantic City to Singapore to Sydney, the extended family still talked about him with a mixture of affection and exasperation. &quot;Bhai Sonny, he should have been a great man, he should have been the most successful of all of us. My God, when I think of all the money he made ... and lost ... &quot; his wealthy younger brother said to us on a brief visit to Karachi, shaking his head ruefully at the shocking waste of it all. The truth was that my father, so very charming, and so very talented, was a compulsive gambler, and he used all his considerable skills to feed his addiction, while cheerfully denying that he was doing anything of the sort. His favourite game was blackjack, and he never gave up believing that he was clever enough to beat the house. He covered his tracks with elegant ease, fooling unwitting investors in his hobby. He&apos;d always been able to lie guiltlessly about the smallest, most mundane thing; he&apos;d pretend he was checking on his dry cleaning at the local Sketchleys, when he&apos;d obviously been at Gloriette&apos;s, the cake shop around the corner. If you ever dared challenge him by asking why he had cake crumbs on his jacket, he acted aggrieved, as though you&apos;d somehow shown the most appalling lack of manners by giving the game away. As a child I got used to not challenging what he said; it was just easier. When my father was flush, he was the most generous man in the world. We lived in a bijou flat in Knightsbridge, and he would whisk us off to Monte Carlo, or to stay in five-star luxury at the George V in Paris, where my sisters and I were allowed to order unlimited room service and jump up and down on the extravagant beds; but when he&apos;d lost the hundreds of thousands he&apos;d just won the previous week, he would simply disappear, sometimes for months at a time, until he&apos;d earned back enough to show his face at the smart Mayfair clubs again. His absence during these periods didn&apos;t trouble me too much; eventually I just accepted not having him around, to the extent that it seemed positively inconvenient when he was. Our mother coped with the feast-and-famine cycle by becoming inordinately frugal with the housekeeping, walking miles to markets where she could save money on our groceries, all to ensure she could cover the rent of our flat; so that whenever our father did resurface, handing his three daughters crisp \u00a350 notes from his money clip as casually as if they were sweets, we&apos;d ask, rather stupidly, &quot;Why is Abbu so rich and Amma so poor?&quot; My father finally skipped out on us altogether when I was 13. I vaguely remember him saying that he was going to the shops; I had got so used to my father&apos;s constant absenteeism and casual departures over the years, that it was quite a few months later that I realised he was gone for good. We had nothing in the bank, but my mother, who had been a housewife for almost 20 years, had gone out with admirable presence of mind, and got a job as a teacher to pay the rent. The only signs we had of him were the unpaid hotel bills fluttering in his wake, which would eventually land on our doorstep, and which we would either ignore or return. My mother and I caught up with him a few years later in Pakistan when I was 16; although still rather fond of him, she had decided that it would be best for us all if she asked for a divorce. My father was as cheerful and amiable as ever. He had met a Chinese-American nurse some 20 years his junior, and was living with her in New York (as much as he lived with anybody); they got married soon after, or so he said. No one attended the wedding and there were no photos. It was one of the many things he claimed that we just accepted. But his globe-trotting went on uninterrupted and he showed no signs of finally settling down. The last time I saw my father was in 2002, on a freezing December day in Paris, just a couple of weeks before he died. It was where I&apos;d met him most often over the years, as he had been barred from the UK since I was a teenager; his chequered record meant that he wasn&apos;t allowed a visa. By this stage, he had also managed to get himself banned from the US; he hadn&apos;t seen his wife for months - she was looking after her terminally ill mother and couldn&apos;t travel, but he didn&apos;t seem interested. He was in his 70s, and his chaotic lifestyle had taken its toll on his diabetes and his thrice attacked and once-bypassed heart, but he had so far refused to go back to Pakistan for medical treatment, where he could be looked after by his younger brothers. After all, he couldn&apos;t gamble in Pakistan with nearly as much freedom as in France. I&apos;d gone to one of the grey suburbs of Paris for a meeting (I worked in advertising at the time), and knowing that my father was convalescing and gambling in Deauville after another heart scare, arranged to meet him at the station where his train would come in. He&apos;d told me on the phone that he was finally intending to go back to Pakistan for treatment of his various maladies, and I&apos;d suggested that we meet up and share a cab to the airport. He was terribly thin and frail, but still full of enthusiasm, happily recounting the names of the healthier and younger acquaintances that he had thus far managed to outlive. &quot;Everyone says I&apos;m dying, but I&apos;m not dead yet!&quot; he exclaimed boisterously. We sat in a bar and looked at photos from my wedding that summer, which he hadn&apos;t been able to attend, and talked about the autobiography he was writing - All Gamblers Great and Small - which he claimed to have with him on CD. When I&apos;d finished my kir, and he&apos;d finished his coffee, I asked if he was ready to go to the airport. &quot;I think I might go tomorrow instead,&quot; he said carelessly, and I knew he intended to put off tomorrow for as long as his funds would allow. He asked me for a few hundred pounds to cover a medical bill. (Having ignored my sisters and I for years, now that we were of independent means, he had taken a renewed interest.) &quot;Sure,&quot; I said, but remembering how one of my sisters had wired \u00a31,000 to him just recently, asked for the invoice, so I could cover it directly with the hospital. He looked at me crossly, as though I was spoiling his fun. There doubtless were medical bills to be paid, but he wasn&apos;t going to pay them, not while the local casino still had a blackjack table. He died in a hotel in Deauville two weeks later, so my eldest sister and I went to Paris, and ended up taking him to the airport after all. His tiny suitcase had been beautifully packed with a capsule wardrobe of several neatly folded suits and sweaters, first editions of his novels, and the wedding photos that I&apos;d given him a fortnight previously. There was no sign of his autobiography; there was a CD in his case, but it was blank. His funeral was in Pakistan. All his obituaries claimed he died romantically in Paris, a final untruth that my father would have been rather pleased to hear. &quot;Who wants to die at home, surrounded by friends and family?&quot; he&apos;d once scoffed. &quot;How bourgeois! I&apos;d rather drop down dead in the streets of Paris.&quot; The obituaries gave various versions of his life that were full of misinformation and half-truths. And funnily enough, my instinct, when asked why I had written a novel about a family that practises complicit deception, was not to tell the truth, but to say anything else. Not because the truth was uncomfortable and awkward, or because I thought it would be better to comfort and conceal with a well-meant lie. My main fear was that if I said that my father&apos;s behaviour had prompted me to explore the theme, it might have smacked of ... approval, somehow, of this wayward man, of carrying on his legacy and letting him get away with it. He had rarely, if ever, been called to account in his life, and it didn&apos;t seem right to extend him any further credit now. After all, he was a compulsive gambler, an occasional white-collar convict, a casual abandoner of wives and children, a man who was frequently as bad as his word and who cheerfully lived and died beyond his means. But no one who met him ever said that he was anything but clever and charming, and for all his faults he was certainly never, ever dull. I realise that I&apos;m saying that with something like pride. Perhaps he got away with it after all. \u00b7 Roopa Farooki&apos;s Bitter Sweets is published by Macmillan at \u00a310."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/28/motorsports.sport", "sentences": ["Valencia will host the European leg on August 24 and the teams will race in Singapore on September 28, subject to approval of the cities&apos; respective street circuits."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-28T01:56:03Z", "title": "Motor sport: Spy row shifts gear as Ferrari claim flaw in McLaren case", "tags": ["Sport", "Motor sport", "Formula one 2007"], "article": "Ferrari last night signalled a possible appeal against the International Automobile Federation&apos;s decision not to penalise McLaren in formula one&apos;s industrial espionage scandal, with the Italian team&apos;s executive director outlining an argument on which such an appeal could be based. After a meeting in Paris the FIA ruled that, although it was clear the championship leaders had received confidential Ferrari data, there was nothing to show the information had been used to boost McLaren&apos;s chances. However, the world governing body warned that the Anglo-German team could be expelled from the championship if such proof emerged. Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the Ferrari president, said yesterday: &quot;I want to say to the fans who are getting in touch with Ferrari from all over the world, offended by the decision taken in Paris, that they need not worry because this affair will not end here.&quot; Ferrari&apos;s executive director, Jean Todt, went further last night, claiming the issue now was not that McLaren had the information but when they had it. The Italian team allege that their former mechanic Nigel Stepney passed sensitive information to McLaren&apos;s chief designer, Mike Coughlan. The Mercedes-powered British stable suspended Coughlan on July 3 and have insisted since then that none of the data he received was used to make changes to their cars. McLaren say they did not know Coughlan had that data until they were told by Ferrari on July 3. The British team stated on July 16 that &quot;no Ferrari material or data are, or have ever been, in the possession of any McLaren employee other than the individual sued by Ferrari&quot;. However, Todt claimed last night that McLaren possessed Ferrari data before the season started. He said on Ferrari&apos;s website: &quot;During yesterday&apos;s meeting, the McLaren bosses, with no exceptions, admitted that their chief designer had obtained since back in March, prior to the Australian GP, documents from Nigel Stepney. Some of this data was used to prepare a clarification request submitted to the FIA, aimed clearly at us.&quot; In the &quot;clarification request&quot; McLaren pointed out to the FIA that some teams were running a &quot;flexible floor&quot; on their cars, a design strategy to improve performance. McLaren requested a rule clarification in March and the FIA subsequently revised the floor regulations after the season-opening Australian grand prix. Ferrari were one of the teams affected. The Scuderia&apos;s Kimi Raikkonen won in Australia but they were then beaten in Malaysia by Fernando Alonso for McLaren. Todt said last night: &quot;Such information was in fact used to obtain an advantage over us, not through an improvement in their performance but instead through limiting ours.&quot; Stepney said of Thursday&apos;s decision: &quot;It is right that the world championship should be won on the track.&quot; But Todt claimed in an interview with the daily Corriere della Sera that his team were suffering discrimination. &quot;I wonder [what would have happened] if 780 confidential documents of another team had been found in the house of a Ferrari designer, the chief designer,&quot; he said, adding there would have been calls for the Italian team to be taught a lesson. &quot;And it would have happened. It&apos;s like having played poker with an adversary who knows your cards.&quot; Luigi Macaluso, an Italian on the FIA board, said he was the only one of the 25 members to argue for McLaren to be penalised. &quot;For me they are guilty and that&apos;s that. Juve were sent to Serie B for a lot less,&quot; he said in reference to Italian football&apos;s match-fixing scandal last year. Meanwhile, two new venues will host grands prix next season as part of an 18-race calendar approved by the FIA&apos;s world motor sport council yesterday.

Now some of Britain&apos;s grandest legal brains have been called in to sort it out - meaning that the closely guarded details of the falling-out between two of the world&apos;s wealthiest men are suddenly becoming public. In one corner is the Sultan of Brunei, supreme ruler of the tiny, oil-rich state nestled beside Malaysia on the island of Borneo. In the other is Prince Jefri Bolkiah, his youngest and once-favourite brother. Brunei&apos;s former Finance Minister, Prince Jefri became known as PJ to friends during his jet-setting heyday in the Nineties. The tabloid stories he inspired spoke of gold-plated toilet brushes, a Boeing 747 customised to carry polo ponies, even a gold-plated toaster in one of his cars. More important, the prince was founding chairman of the Brunei Investment Agency. Billions of pounds in oil revenues were funnelled by the BIA into domestic development and overseas property investments, famously including London&apos;s Dorchester Hotel. And a sum of some \u00a320bn - it was alleged in one of the more sensational revelations to emerge in the hearings this month before the Law Lords in London - went into the accounts of the now estranged brothers. Brotherly loved turned sour a decade ago. Prince Jefri was accused of having misappropriated about $15bn in BIA funds. He was fired, his funds frozen. Brunei demanded restitution. The brothers reached an out-of-court settlement in 2000. And there things stood until it began unravelling with a vengeance. Prince Jefri claims the Sultan gave him verbal assurances that if he signed the restitution settlement he would be allowed &apos;lifestyle&apos; exemptions, allowing him to keep a small number of foreign properties. The BIA says there was no such deal, and that Prince Jefri has defaulted on his written undertaking to return virtually everything. This, the London court has revealed, involves riches on a gargantuan scale. According to Prince Jefri&apos;s submission to the Law Lords, he has already handed back more than 500 properties in Brunei; over 100 properties outside Brunei, 1,700 cars; five boats, nine aircraft and over 100 paintings by famous artists. All of which leaves the disputed properties. Prince Jefri is down to his last two homes and last two hotels: St John&apos;s Lodge, near Regent&apos;s Park in London, 3-5 Place Vendome near the Ritz in Paris, the Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, and the Bel Air Hotel in Los Angeles. Both sides have been girding for a final battle after fighting their way to the highest courts in Brunei. There, the Chief Justice ruled against Prince Jefri, rejecting the idea there had been a lifestyle agreement and telling him to comply. There was just one avenue left to the prince: the final appeal before the Privy Council in London. Nothing in the cast of characters or the surroundings, as the council hearings began, could have prepared an unsuspecting observer for the fireworks to follow. The venue was a courtroom in Downing Street. On the bench were five Law Lords, chaired by Lord Bingham of Cornhill, a former Lord Chief Justice. But amid the dry legal argument, there emerged a battery of embarrassing and potentially explosive allegations and counter-allegations. None is likely to prove more incendiary than Prince Jefri&apos;s contention that the dispute arose because an agreed carve-up of BIA funds by the two men - involving &apos;special transfers&apos; into their personal accounts - went sour. &apos;The matter of special transfers is at the heart of the dispute between the two brothers,&apos; the prince&apos;s lawyers said. &apos;They total more than $40bn. It is His Royal Highness Prince Jefri&apos;s case that there was an agreement to divide up much of the monies between them. It is an agreed fact that of the special transfers that the BIA previously alleged were public money, some $8bn went into the private accounts of His Majesty,&apos; the lawyers added. Far from &apos;misappropriating&apos; the funds, the lawyers added, Prince Jefri had used them for &apos;...major infrastructure projects, such as power stations and roads in Brunei&apos;. Much of the rest was for &apos;gifts&apos; - one of them totalling $62m - &apos;to various ministers [and] deputy ministers&apos;. Prince Jefri&apos;s team also claimed that, given the Sultan&apos;s hold on Brunei, a fair ruling there was impossible. The BIA&apos;s counterblast began with an insistence the Sultan&apos;s role had nothing to do with the row. He, the lawyers said, was not a party to the case. It was the BIA whose funds were at issue. There were so many &apos;inconsistencies&apos; in Prince Jefri&apos;s accounts of the &apos;lifestyle agreement&apos;, they said, that the Chief Justice had reached the only obvious conclusion: there had been no such deal. Describing Prince Jefri as &apos;the disgraced former Minister of Finance and chairman of the BIA&apos;, its lawyers said he was lucky to have got as good a deal as he did. The agency had paid &apos;roughly \u00a3100 million&apos; to settle other parties&apos; claims against him. The Privy Council has broken up for the summer holiday, with a ruling expected in the autumn. The BIA was said to be confident of its ground: a deal was a deal; the prince was trying to back out of it. The prince, said friends, was also hopeful. &apos;He believes he has done much good for Brunei, and feels this is an issue of fairness,&apos; one said. The stakes could hardly be higher. A BIA statement after last year&apos;s victory in the Brunei courts made it clear they are targeting not just his homes and hotels. &apos;Other assets required to be transferred,&apos; it said, &apos;include valuable assets in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, France, the UK and the USA; works of art; jewellery, and cash...&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/29/football.newsstory", "sentences": ["Shinawatra&apos;s controversial sale of family shares in Shin Corp, a Thai telecoms company, to the Singapore government brought about his downfall in a military coup last year and he is under investigation for corruption in his home country."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-29T03:37:33Z", "title": "Selling off the family silver", "tags": ["Sport", "Football"], "article": "Arsenal Who used to own it? Old Etonian Peter Hill-Wood is the third member of his family to serve as chairman, his grandfather becoming the first in 1929. But his holding is less than one per cent, after selling many of his shares to David Dein in the Eighties. In 1999, Dein himself sold some of his shares to Danny Fiszman who, along with Nina Bracewell-Smith, Richard Carr and Granada Ventures, made up the main shareholders. Who owns it now? In April, American Stan Kroenke bought out Granada to take up a 12 per cent stake. At the same time, David Dein, with a 14 per cent share and believed to be a supporter of Kroenke, resigned as vice-chairman after members of the board, led by Hill-Wood, voted not to sell their shares for a year, to thwart a possible takeover. 2005-06 Turnover \u00a3133m 2005-06 Profit \u00a316m Chelsea Who used to own it? Ken Bates purchased the club for \u00a31 in 1982. An outspoken chairman, Bates secured the freehold and rebuilding of the club&apos;s Stamford Bridge ground. In 1994, Matthew Harding invested over \u00a325m in Chelsea but fell out with Bates before his death in 1996. Who owns it now? In 2003, Roman Abramovich became the first foreigner to buy a Premier League side when he took the club, on the brink of bankruptcy, off Bates for \u00a3140m. The Russian made his money in the post-Communist era of privatisation, when state assets were controversially sold off at low prices in closed auctions. His investment helped the club win back-to-back Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006. 2005-06 Turnover \u00a3152m 2005-06 Loss \u00a380m Liverpool Who used to own it? The Moores family, owners of the Littlewoods group until 2002, made their first investment in the 1950s. David Moores, nephew of John Moores, a former chairman of Everton who founded the family business, was chairman from 1991 until 2007 and held a 51 per cent stake. Who owns it now? American billionaires George Gillett and Tom Hicks acquired Moores&apos;s holding for \u00a3470m in February and now own the club 100 per cent. Gillett, who made his money in the meat industry, is a former owner of the Miami Dolphins; Hicks, a financial investor, has interests in ice hockey and baseball and has close ties to the Bush family. Their money has already seen the club break its transfer record with the signing of Fernando Torres. 2005-06 Turnover \u00a3122m 2005-06 Loss \u00a35m Manchester United Who used to own it? After failing to sell the club to potential buyers such as Robert Maxwell and Michael Knighton, chairman and chief executive Martin Edwards floated the club on the stock market in 1991. This eventually led to Rupert Murdoch&apos;s BSkyB and Irish racing entrepreneurs JP McManus and John Magnier taking significant holdings. Who owns it now? Malcolm Glazer, a 76-year-old American, took control in 2005, after a year of building up his stake, when he bought the 29 per cent owned by McManus and Magnier. Glazer also owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who won the Super Bowl in 2003. His sons Avram, Bryan and Joel sit on the United board. 2005-06 Turnover \u00a3168m 2005-06 Profit\u00a331m Aston Villa Who&apos;s the boss? Randy Lerner, who made his money as a director of credit-card company MBNA, has a personal fortune of around $1.6bn (\u00a3800m) and discovered football in his undergraduate days at Cambridge. He made a \u00a362.6m bid for Villa last August, buying the 39 per cent stake of Doug Ellis who had been chairman since 1982, and took full control in September. He also owns the Cleveland Browns American football team. Birmingham City Who&apos;s the boss? Until last month, the Gold brothers, Ralph and David, along with David Sullivan, owned 78 per cent of the club. But when they agreed with other shareholders, including Karren Brady, to sell part of their stake to Carson Yeung for \u00a315m, the Hong Kong businessman became the biggest shareholder, with 29.9 per cent of City. Yeung owns another club, Hong Kong Rangers, and fell out with their manager after allegedly interfering in team matters. Blackburn Who&apos;s the boss? Jack Walker, who died in 2000, bought Blackburn in 1991, appointing Kenny Dalglish as manager and investing heavily in players, which helped the club win the Premier League title in 1995. Walker&apos;s family trust is now in negotiation with two consortiums: one led by Daniel Williams, a Lancastrian with a financial business in the US; the other includes Wayne Huizenga, who owns the Miami Dolphins and built up Blockbuster Video from 19 stores to 3,700. Bolton Who&apos;s the boss? Eddie Davies took control in 2003, having made his money in Strix, a thermostat maker. Though based in the Isle of Man, Davies grew up near Bolton and is a Wanderers fan. The day-to-day running of the club is left to chairman Phil Gartside who, with former manager Sam Allardyce, consolidated Bolton&apos;s position in the Premier League. Allardyce resigned in April after the board&apos;s decision to reduce debts rather than spend in the transfer market. Middlesbrough Who&apos;s the boss? Steve Gibson, who owns more than 90 per cent, was born in Middlesbrough and in 1981 set up a business transporting hazardous chemicals. Bulkhaul has earned Gibson, 49, a personal fortune of around \u00a385m. A lifelong Boro fan, he founded the consortium that saved them from liquidation in 1986. He has overseen a transformation in the club&apos;s fortunes, with promotion from the third tier to the Premier League and a Carling Cup win. Newcastle Who&apos;s the boss? In June, entrepreneur Mike Ashley bought the club for \u00a3133m, securing his takeover when he purchased the remaining 41.6 per cent stake owned by property magnate and former chairman Sir John Hall, who had acquired a majority share in 1991, as well as chairman Freddy Shepherd&apos;s 29.8 per cent. The success of Ashley&apos;s chain of sporting goods shops, most notably Sports Direct, which he set up in 1982, has made him a billionaire. Portsmouth Who&apos;s the boss? The club was rescued from administration by Serbian Milan Mandaric in 1998. But Alexandre Gaydamak completed a buy-out from Mandaric last summer, paying \u00a332m. The Franco-Russian businessman - whose father Arcadi has been issued with an international arrest warrant - had initially become involved in January 2006 when an investment of \u00a320m helped Harry Redknapp to preserve the club&apos;s then threatened Premier League status. Reading Who&apos;s the boss? John Madejski, who made most of his \u00a3250m fortune from owning car magazine Auto Trader, bought the club in December 1990 for \u00a3315,000 when they were heading for financial oblivion. Madejski built a new stadium in 1998 - which he named after himself. During Reading&apos;s debut Premier League season in 2006-07, he announced that the club was for sale. He would prefer to sell to a private investor rather than a consortium. Derby Who&apos;s the boss? Owned by Robert Maxwell in the 1980s. In April 2006, local property developer Peter Gadsby led a consortium that took over from John Sleightholme and Jeremy Keith, who headed a group that bought Derby for \u00a327m, using money &apos;from home and abroad&apos;, in 2003. That deal is now being investigated over alleged financial irregularities. Gadsby cleared debts estimated at \u00a352m; Derby were promoted in May. Everton Who&apos;s the boss? Local businessman and Liverpool fan Peter Johnson made his fortune in the food industry and took a controlling share of Everton in 1994. After a boardroom struggle, theatre impressario Bill Kenwright headed a consortium to buy out Johnson&apos;s 68 per cent stake in 1999. Last year, US-based entrepreneur Robert Earl, founder of the Planet Hollywood chain, who also has interests in Las Vegas, acquired a 23 per cent holding. Fulham Who&apos;s the boss? TV commentator and former player Jimmy Hill became chairman in 1987 and helped avert bankruptcy and a merger with nearby Queens Park Rangers. Controversial Egyptian businessman Mohamed al-Fayed then took control in 1997. Under &apos;Chairman Mo&apos;, Fulham were promoted two divisions, reaching the Premier League in 2001 on the back of his investment. The Harrods owner is now based abroad for tax reasons. Manchester City Who&apos;s the boss? In July, ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra became the legal owner after buying out major shareholders BSkyB, John Wardle, the Boler family trust and former player and chairman Francis Lee. Shinawatra&apos;s controversial sale of family shares in Shin Corp, a Thai telecoms company, to the Singapore government brought about his downfall in a military coup last year and he is under investigation for corruption in his home country. Tottenham Who&apos;s the boss?  Sir Alan Sugar, owner of Amstrad computers and star of The Apprentice, bought the club in 1991 for \u00a38m and installed Terry Venables, a former manager, as chief executive, before sacking him in 1993. Sports group ENIC, led by chairman Daniel Levy, then paid \u00a322m for 27 per cent of the club in 2000. It now owns two thirds after purchasing Sugar&apos;s final 12 per cent share in June and is trying to buy out the remaining shareholders. Sunderland Who&apos;s the boss? Long-term chairman Bob Murray, who moved the club from Roker Park to their new home at the Stadium of Light in 1997, sold up last year to Drumaville, a consortium led by former Republic of Ireland and Sunderland striker Niall Quinn and including seven other Irish investors. Quinn appointed as manager Roy Keane - despite having fallen out with him when they played for the Republic of Ireland - and the team were promoted to the Premiership. West Ham Who&apos;s the boss? The Cearns and Warner families, the club&apos;s original founders, and chairman Terry Brown were bought out last November by a consortium financed by Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and led by Eggert Magnusson. The world&apos;s 799th richest man, Gudmundsson survived a financial scandal in his native Iceland - he received a 12-month suspended sentence in 1991 for embezzlement - to become a billionaire from banking. Wigan Who&apos;s the boss? Dave Whelan, a former Blackburn player whose career ended early due to injury, built up JJB Sports, the largest sports retail chain in the UK, before selling his final stake last month for \u00a3190m. The 70-year-old set up a chain of supermarkets, which he sold to Morrisons for \u00a31.5m in 1978. Whelan bought Wigan, then in the bottom division, in 1995; his money helped them reach the Premiership in 2005. He also owns Wigan Warriors rugby league club."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/29/newsstory.sport", "sentences": ["In Singapore, the TV rights were sold for $160m over the same period."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-29T16:51:37Z", "title": "Tom Bower: The big sell out", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "No other country allows the crown jewels of their major sport to become the uncontrolled playthings of investors whose backgrounds remain untested. The Football Association&apos;s failure to investigate properly the background of the foreign nationals buying top clubs or their growing influence on the sport heralds the end of the Premier League as an English institution. Persuaded that football&apos;s only hope of survival is spending unlimited millions of pounds, the game&apos;s administrators have swallowed the myth that the Premier League can flourish only by unquestioningly allowing a wholesale takeover by foreign investors. The silence and self-inflicted paralysis in Soho Square is endangering the whole of English football. The rot started when Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch, was allowed to buy Chelsea in 2003, despite the controversial origins of his fortune. Many Chelsea fans believed that Abramovich&apos;s billions would not have any negative effects on football in England. Standing on the sidelines, the FA and even the government, with powers to scrutinise any directors seeking to control a public company, allowed Chelsea to become an oligarch&apos;s toy without heeding the warnings that, while Abramovich&apos;s love of football seemed genuine, his money would destabilise the Premier League. The predictions were accurate. Four years later, the billionaire&apos;s investment looks shrewd. Having paid \u00a3150m for Chelsea, Abramovich could now resell the club for at least \u00a3500m. Over the next two years, the majority of Premier League clubs are destined to be owned by foreigners. Premier League football will not be played for English fans, but for one billion paying spectators on global television. Financially that might be rewarding for rich investors and for the players themselves, but the benefit for fans and for the national team is questionable. The English game, some believe, is facing a fatal blowback. Richard Scudamore, the gung-ho chief executive of the Premier League, has welcomed foreign takeovers as &apos;irresistible&apos;. Their millions, he predicted some years ago, would enhance the game. Thanks to foreign players and foreign money, the Premier League has certainly become the world&apos;s wealthiest, most watched and admired national competition. But Scudamore now risks being devoured by his new paymasters and the consequences for English football could be catastrophic. Over recent weeks, some of the nine foreign owners of Premier League clubs have been quietly discussing Scudamore&apos;s dismissal and his replacement by a non-British executive. Their motives are financial. Having spent millions to buy the clubs and many more millions on foreign players, they are impatient about inadequate profits. Scudamore, they complain, is an amateur compared to his American peers. &apos;Only the Americans know how to really market the Premier League brand,&apos; says a football agent close to the foreign owners. &apos;They&apos;ve got Scudamore with his unsophisticated &quot;Third World&quot; mentality. A proper marketing expert could earn millions more from the most exciting sporting fixture in the world.&apos; To maximise the profits, the foreign investors argue, the Premier League should be rebranded and marketed like Coca-Cola. In his defence, Scudamore can parade the high fees being paid by Asian television companies for the rights to show Premier League matches. In Hong Kong, the host broadcasters have just paid $200m (\u00a3100m) to screen the next three seasons&apos; matches, which amounts to about $10 spent per match for each viewer. In Singapore, the TV rights were sold for $160m over the same period. The biggest area of potential growth is China, which has paid $50m but is identified as a future bonanza. Those deals will contribute \u00a3625m to the Premier League over the next three years. And that&apos;s the rub. While Scudamore practically doubled the league&apos;s income over the previous contract, the new foreign owners want more. The recent tours by Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United to America and the Far East and South Africa are as much about long-term marketing as generating immediate income. Scudamore&apos;s successor is likely to be an American without any interest in the 37,500 English clubs affiliated to the Football Association, or the Premier League clubs&apos; commitment to the England team. The Premier League&apos;s relationship with the FA, already frail as a result of Scudamore&apos;s disdain, would be further jeopardised. With at least four more Premier League clubs, including Everton, Arsenal and Fulham (owned by the would-be Brit Mohamed al-Fayed) expected to be sold over the next year or so, the balance of power is inexorably tilting in the foreigners&apos; favour. No alternative scenario seems feasible. To remain in the Premier League with a chance of qualifying for the lucrative Champions League requires tens of millions of pounds to buy new players. Liverpool, for instance, have just signed the young Spain striker Fernando Torres for an improbable \u00a326m, a club record. One of Liverpool&apos;s main rivals, Arsenal, have in recent seasons begun to struggle because much of the club&apos;s money was spent on a new stadium, the 60,000-capacity Emirates, rather than players. Depressingly, none of the club&apos;s potential buyers is English. That is consistent with the absence of any Englishmen offering to buy West Ham, Aston Villa or Portsmouth. Even Liverpool were never destined to be bought by a wealthy local fan. The English are cashing in their national sport to earn fast money. Greed is not the only reason. No Englishman, it seems, has the vision and ability to secure an adequate profit from Premier League football as an owner. Daniel Levy, chief executive of Tottenham, would accept, it appears, an offer at \u00a3200m for the club (his company ENIC bought an initial 29.9 per cent share in Spurs in 2000 for \u00a322m and now owns 66 per cent), while Danny Fiszman, one of Arsenal&apos;s major shareholders, would agree to sell his shares if the club were bought for \u00a3400m, plus \u00a3300m of debt. There is no shortage of bidders for Arsenal. Boris Berezovsky, the fugitive Russian oligarch, unsuccessfully negotiated to buy the club and, like other oligarchs, oil sheikhs and Asian magnates, is still hunting for his prize. Their reasons are obvious: the international status of owning a Premier League club far outshines possession of aluminium plants and oil wells. Their motives are little different from generations of British owners. Sitting in the directors&apos; box, surrounded by thousands of screaming fans, and looking down at &apos;your&apos; team does wonders for the ego. Does it matter if Doug Ellis at Aston Villa sells out to an American or Terry Brown at West Ham is replaced by an Icelandic biscuit tycoon? Certainly, few would see little reason to cry that Ken Bates, previous owner of Chelsea, has been swapped for Abramovich. Pini Zahavi, the Israeli agent responsible for brokering Abramovich&apos;s purchase of Chelsea, Alexandre Gaydamak&apos;s takeover of Portsmouth, and Kia Joorabchian&apos;s failed bid for West Ham, epitomises the unsentimental predator. &apos;What&apos;s the problem?&apos; he asks rhetorically. &apos;Britain has sold its banks, its gas, electricity and water supply companies and even its airports to foreign companies.&apos; Laughing, he adds: &apos;Ninety per cent of Mayfair is foreign owned and sometimes all of Arsenal&apos;s team is foreign, so why not the football clubs? Honestly, I can&apos;t understand what difference it makes.&apos; The difference is that football is not a utility or a bank, but part of the fabric of England, uniting so much of the nation in frenzy and depression during international competitions such as the World Cup. That communal glorification is already threatened by the rising costs of watching Premier League matches. With the exception of the top-six clubs, spectators are increasingly deterred from watching less glamorous matches from the stands because of excessive ticket prices and the amount of football shown on television. More insidious is the growing habit by the managers of the star clubs to &apos;rest&apos; their best players in matches against their inferior rivals and in cup matches. That disappoints the fans, is a step towards potential match-fixing and hastens the introduction of a European super league, a poisonous scheme for English football. The only possible block to a complete foreign takeover of the game at the highest level would be the Football Association. Notorious for freebies and fiefdoms, the FA&apos;s executives and members are stubbornly loath to reform themselves. Ineffective to prevent corruption by agents, remove conflicts of interest among club owners (such as Chelsea&apos;s flagrant disregard for protocol when they tapped up Arsenal&apos;s Ashley Cole in January 2005) and control the spiralling prices and wages for players, they have meekly accepted their impotence at the power of the Premier League. Outwitted first by Scudamore and now by the foreign owners, the FA are powerless to persuade football&apos;s new tycoons to develop and sustain the sport at a local level. In those circumstances, English football could be said to be fortunate that foreigners have come to the rescue. Sky - owned by a naturalised American - and the major clubs owned by foreigners have invested enough money to save English football from its mounting debts. The downside is that the foreigners understandably appear only interested in personal wealth and glory. None is genuinely interested in investing in British youth or re-establishing closer relations between the clubs and the fans, or encouraging football&apos;s grassroots in order to strengthen the national game. According to former West Ham chairman Terry Brown, who was replaced at the East End club when an Icelandic consortium bought them for \u00a385m, his successor, Eggert Magnusson, has made little effort to retain the club&apos;s relationship with local charities and council officials. (When contacted, West Ham said they would shortly be announcing &apos;two initiatives&apos; with local charities.) So far, foreign players and managers have been tolerated because the game remained under English control. The first foreign takeovers were seen as eccentric but not threatening. That will change if Americans, Russians, Arabs and the odd shady Thai politician execute a wholesale takeover. Not only would the game lose its English identity but, more important, the FA&apos;s benign influence would be further eroded. Impotent against the foreign investors, the FA would find it increasingly hard to organise and train the England team and adequately police the rules about the registration of players and financial probity. As the divorce between the FA and Premier League solidified, loyal fans could well become disenchanted by the internationalisation of their clubs. The blowback for the investors would be empty seats in the stadiums reflecting the fans&apos; anger that their passion had become a plaything for remote speculators. \u00b7 Tom Bower is the author of Broken Dreams: Vanity, Greed and the Souring of British Football (Simon &amp; Schuster) The revolution in numbers 11 Number of players from outside the UK and Ireland who started the opening matches in the first weekend of the Premier League in 1992 340 Players from outside the UK and Ireland in the Premier League at the end of last season 75,000 Average annual salary in pounds at the start of the Premier League in 1992.

Pini Zahavi, the Israeli agent responsible for brokering Abramovich&apos;s purchase of Chelsea, Alexandre Gaydamak&apos;s takeover of Portsmouth, and Kia Joorabchian&apos;s failed bid for West Ham, epitomises the unsentimental predator. &apos;What&apos;s the problem?&apos; he asks rhetorically. &apos;Britain has sold its banks, its gas, electricity and water supply companies and even its airports to foreign companies.&apos; Laughing, he adds: &apos;Ninety per cent of Mayfair is foreign owned and sometimes all of Arsenal&apos;s team is foreign, so why not the football clubs? Honestly, I can&apos;t understand what difference it makes.&apos; The difference is that football is not a utility or a bank, but part of the fabric of England, uniting so much of the nation in frenzy and depression during international competitions such as the World Cup. That communal glorification is already threatened by the rising costs of watching Premier League matches. With the exception of the top-six clubs, spectators are increasingly deterred from watching less glamorous matches from the stands because of excessive ticket prices and the amount of football shown on television. More insidious is the growing habit by the managers of the star clubs to &apos;rest&apos; their best players in matches against their inferior rivals and in cup matches. That disappoints the fans, is a step towards potential match-fixing and hastens the introduction of a European super league, a poisonous scheme for English football. The only possible block to a complete foreign takeover of the game at the highest level would be the Football Association. Notorious for freebies and fiefdoms, the FA&apos;s executives and members are stubbornly loath to reform themselves. Ineffective to prevent corruption by agents, remove conflicts of interest among club owners (such as Chelsea&apos;s flagrant disregard for protocol when they tapped up Arsenal&apos;s Ashley Cole in January 2005) and control the spiralling prices and wages for players, they have meekly accepted their impotence at the power of the Premier League. Outwitted first by Scudamore and now by the foreign owners, the FA are powerless to persuade football&apos;s new tycoons to develop and sustain the sport at a local level. In those circumstances, English football could be said to be fortunate that foreigners have come to the rescue. Sky - owned by a naturalised American - and the major clubs owned by foreigners have invested enough money to save English football from its mounting debts. The downside is that the foreigners understandably appear only interested in personal wealth and glory. None is genuinely interested in investing in British youth or re-establishing closer relations between the clubs and the fans, or encouraging football&apos;s grassroots in order to strengthen the national game. According to former West Ham chairman Terry Brown, who was replaced at the East End club when an Icelandic consortium bought them for \u00a385m, his successor, Eggert Magnusson, has made little effort to retain the club&apos;s relationship with local charities and council officials. (When contacted, West Ham said they would shortly be announcing &apos;two initiatives&apos; with local charities.) So far, foreign players and managers have been tolerated because the game remained under English control. The first foreign takeovers were seen as eccentric but not threatening. That will change if Americans, Russians, Arabs and the odd shady Thai politician execute a wholesale takeover. Not only would the game lose its English identity but, more important, the FA&apos;s benign influence would be further eroded. Impotent against the foreign investors, the FA would find it increasingly hard to organise and train the England team and adequately police the rules about the registration of players and financial probity. As the divorce between the FA and Premier League solidified, loyal fans could well become disenchanted by the internationalisation of their clubs. The blowback for the investors would be empty seats in the stadiums reflecting the fans&apos; anger that their passion had become a plaything for remote speculators. \u00b7 Tom Bower is the author of Broken Dreams: Vanity, Greed and the Souring of British Football (Simon &amp; Schuster)"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/31/ianmackinnon1", "sentences": ["No country has been left untouched, with the richest countries, including ultra-modern Singapore, and the poorest, such as Laos and Cambodia, all fighting the virus.", "Singapore&apos;s building sites, full of migrant workers, have been the focus of outbreaks as mosquitoes bite infected workers and then pass the disease to others."], "publicationDate": "2007-07-31T16:06:35Z", "title": "Dengue fever sweeps SE Asia", "tags": ["World news"], "article": "Dengue fever is sweeping south-east Asia in an outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus that is already threatening to become the worst epidemic in almost a decade.

The economic secretary to the Treasury, Kitty Ussher, identified &quot;the Heathrow hassle&quot; as a factor damaging the City&apos;s status as a financial centre. The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said the wretched terminus &quot;shames London&quot;. John Tincey, of the Immigration Service Union, observed that passport control queues were longer than many short haul international flights. A survey of Heathrow&apos;s recent coverage would leave a neutral observer imagining that, were some or other yahoos to attempt a Glasgow airport-style assault upon the place, they would barely be able to see to steer their car bomb through the rose petals flung by grateful citizens. The opprobrium piled upon Heathrow, while largely merited, misses a crucial point. The key to understanding the ghastliness of Heathrow airport is not the &quot;Heathrow&quot; but the &quot;airport&quot;. I spend a lot of time in airports, and can confidently declare Heathrow no worse than most. Airports are full of people who, by definition, wish they were somewhere else. Perhaps for this reason, no consideration appears to be given to making airports pleasant environments in which to be. The queues and the pettifogging security checks probably can&apos;t be helped. The overwhelming, dispiriting characterlessness of the places can. In 2007 alone, I&apos;ve used the airports of London, Sydney, Melbourne, New York, Bucharest, Graz, Caracas, Nice, Bangkok and Singapore. Any one of them could have been any of the others: the same Speer-meets-Starck architecture, the same Dan Brown books on the racks, the same posters of David Beckham in stupid sunglasses, the same bloody awful food, the same piped pop pabulum. The only one that distinguished itself in my recent travels was Mehrabad airport in Tehran, which, while a decrepit dump, at least flaunted some local character - the Islamically correct gender-divided entrances to security screening; the huge gilt-framed tapestries unfathomably offered in duty free. The fault is a cultural one with the airline industry in general, not merely Heathrow in particular. Possibly in a bid to relax us about hurtling through the sky at 1,000 kilometres an hour, airports aim to make the experience seem boring and ordinary. That they have been rather too successful at this can be confirmed by surveying the morose, defeated herd known as the travelling public. Airports - especially Heathrow, which handles more international passengers than any other - should reconnect themselves and ourselves with the staggering accomplishment of modern air travel, which has done more to promote a global consciousness than anything else we&apos;ve ever done. For those awaiting departure, there could be aviation museums instead of shops, galleries instead of theme pubs, pilots lecturing on the marvels of their trade. For those arriving, an airport should at least say something about the city it serves - other, that is, than the current default, of Heathrow and all other ports of arrival on our querulous planet, of: &quot;Who the hell are you, and what do you want?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2007/aug/02/tistheseason2", "sentences": ["[For those philosophically opposed to academics looking at games, Jessica may offer some answers in her keynote, &quot;Industry &amp; Academia talking: what&apos;s the point?&quot;] State of Play V: Building the Global Metaverse 19 - 22 August, Singapore Obviously /the/ pointy headed event of the year for those in the know, locating it in Asia this year is genius."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-02T13:11:39Z", "title": "'Tis the season for games events", "tags": ["Events", "Games", "Technology"], "article": "While the marvellously talented game developers get back to work after the revelry that was Develop, the riff-raff that orbits around their labour has a busy few weeks ahead.

It&apos;\u2122s more tech focused than the other events listed here, but understating practice does actually come in handy sometimes.

A deal was expected to be announced at any time, but instead the company announced this morning it was postponing the move.   &quot;M&amp;B has concluded that the joint venture proposal is unlikely to be achieved until debt markets have improved,&quot; it said. Its shares dropped 35p to 713p.   The contagion from the sub-prime mortgage market problems in the US has left banks holding debt they are unable to sell on to other investors, which in turn has led to a reluctance by financiers to continue backing deals.   M&amp;B&apos;s decision stems from this situation, and analysts said other such plans may also falter.   So Greene King, which had been looking at a similar move, fell 16p to 964.5p while Marstons lost 11p to 370.25p and Punch Taverns was 4p lower at \u00a311.12.   Leisure group Whitbread dropped 65p to \u00a315.88, with traders saying the credit problems could put off any potential predator.

We expect the first quarter 2008 result to be decent.&quot;   Vodafone jumped 6.2p to 156.6p with 258m shares traded, on the back of upbeat results from both phone maker Nokia and France Telecom.   Moving on to takeover situations, chemicals group ICI was steady at 627.5p awaiting developments. To recap, Akzo Nobel has put a 650p a share offer on the table, but dealers said US rival Dow Chemicals might step in. Meanwhile ICI reported a 13% rise in second quarter profit.   Among the insurers, Resolution slipped 8p to 653p despite rival Pearl raising its stake to 16.47%. Dealers believe Pearl may make a move on Resolution to prevent the latter&apos;s plan to merge with Friends Provident. Old Mutual and Aviva are among names being suggested as possible rival predators for Friends, up 3.2p to 190.2p.   Prudential was 22p better at 700p as WestLB moved from reduce to hold, while Cadbury Schweppes rose 18p to 587p after Cazenove raised its target price from 670p to 700p.

But Alfred McAlpine added 26.5p to 475p after it unveiled the results of a strategy review. It plans to sell its PFI operations and slate business, then demerge the rest into two separately listed companies, business services and infrastructure services.

Finally technology group Pursuit Dynamics - hit heavily by a negative broker note in recent days - added 35.5p to 312p after it received US approval for its FireMist fire suppression product.

Elsewhere pub groups were weaker after Mitchells &amp; Butler delayed its long awaited joint venture with property entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz because of the current credit crunch. M&amp;B had planned to put 1,300 pubs into the partnership, as a way of unlocking some of the value in its properties. A deal was expected to be announced at any time, but instead the company said it was postponing the move. Analysts said similar plans by other pub companies may also falter. So Greene King fell 16p to 964.5p while Marstons lost 11p to 370.25p, Enterprise Inns dipped 9.5p to 647p and Punch Taverns was 4p lower at \u00a311.12. Leisure group Whitbread dropped 65p to \u00a315.88, with traders saying the problems with raising debt at the moment could put off any potential predator. US group Starwood Capital has often been tipped as being interested. Overall the market looked a bit brighter after the last few traumatic days, helped by the fact that the Bank of England decided not to spring any surprises, and left interest rates on hold at 5.75%. However traders pointed out that there are some key figures due out today from the US, specifically the non-farm payroll numbers, which would be closely watched. By the close of play, the FTSE 100 index was 49.7 points better at 6300.3, helped by some positive results from Unilever, Smith &amp; Nephew and indeed, Barclays. Consumer goods group Unilever added 64p to \u00a315.68 as second quarter figures came in ahead of expectations. The company is also planning 20,000 job cuts. Medical group Smith &amp; Nephew reported a 19% profit rise for the same quarter, and its shares added 7p to 593p. Meanwhile British Airways recovered 17.5p to 403.75p after this week&apos;s news of a \u00a3270m price fixing fine. ABN Amro said: &quot;We upgrade from sell to hold, with our 400p target price and estimates unchanged. Our thesis is unchanged: we see BA facing very material challenges from open skies, but recent share price moves seem to reflect this.&quot; Vodafone jumped 6.2p to 156.6p with 258m shares traded, on the back of upbeat results from both France Telecom and phone maker Nokia. Moving on to takeover situations, chemicals group ICI was steady at 627.5p awaiting developments. To recap, Akzo Nobel has put a 650p-a-share offer on the table, but dealers said US rival Dow Chemicals might step in with a rival bid. Meanwhile ICI reported a 13% rise in second-quarter profit. Among the insurers, Resolution slipped 8p to 653p despite rival Pearl raising its stake to 16.47%. Dealers believe Pearl may make a move on Resolution to prevent the latter&apos;s plan to merge with Friends Provident. Old Mutual and Aviva are among names being suggested as possible rival predators for Friends, up 3.2p to 190.2p. Prudential was 22p better at 700p as WestLB moved from reduce to hold, while Cadbury Schweppes rose 18p to 587p after Cazenove raised its target price from 670p to 700p. Water group Kelda added 13p to 848.5p despite Goldman Sachs cutting its recommendation from neutral to sell, but disappointing results from Rio Tinto left it 110p lower at \u00a333.35. Engineering business Invensys lost 38.25p to 341.75p in reaction to its first-quarter operating profits which came in below expectations, while technology consultancy Detica fell 26.5p to 338.5p after Panmure Gordon rated its annual meeting statement as disappointing. But Alfred McAlpine added 26.5p to 475p after it unveiled the results of a strategy review. It plans to sell its PFI operations and slate business, then demerge the rest into two separately listed companies - business services and infrastructure services. Lower down the market Metals Exploration was 1.5p better at 44.25p as it confirmed the renewal of a permit for the Runruno project in the Philippines. Finally technology group Pursuit Dynamics - hit heavily by a negative broker note in recent days - added 35.5p to 312p after it received US approval for its FireMist fire suppression product. Pursuit&apos;s US partner Tyco now plans to press ahead with a US and European launch of FireMist, which is said to be more efficient than existing fire fighting systems. Meanwhile further news is expected shortly on tests on the company&apos;s bioethanol technology. Debenhams shopping Debenhams has recovered some ground recently. Traders have spotted some interesting share-buying, namely by directors Rob Templeman and John Lovering and by the Icelandic group Baugur. Templeman and his wife each bought 50,000 shares in the department store group last week while Lovering purchased 150,000. The Icelanders have raised their stake from 9% to 10.6% and they recently had to say there were no plans to bid. Credit Suisse yesterday raised its full-year profit estimate by 7% after recent store visits. It said Debenhams&apos; credibility had been undermined by earlier mistakes, and so the company was seen as more high risk than its established business model deserved. Credit Suisse set a 160p target price, helping push the shares up 5.75p to 129.25p.  nick.fletcher@theguardian.com "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2007/aug/03/modernmosquesarethereligio", "sentences": ["Singapore is home to Forum Architects&apos; Assyafaah Mosque, a contemporary building in a city where contemporary interpretations of Islam also thrive."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-03T15:11:45Z", "title": "Modern mosques are as bad as Barratt homes", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "&apos;No charm and no authenticity&apos; ... The Hassan II mosque in Casablanca. Photograph: Abdelhak Senna/EPA One of the least satisfying buildings I have been to is the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca. The work of architect Michel Pinseau, it is a pastiche of the region&apos;s medieval mosques, scaled-up for the skyscraper age. The minaret, a supersize copy of the elegant towers of Marrakesh and Meknes, is the tallest in the world. There&apos;s a giant, retractable roof, like a football stadium. It resembles a traditional place of worship, minus the charm and the authenticity.  Unfortunately, pretty much the same could be said about British mosques. This week it was announced that the country&apos;s earliest, founded in 1889 by Abdullah Quilliam, is likely to be restored. As a converted semi-detached house it was never likely to set architectural pulses racing, and is being preserved more for its cultural value. Even if it were competing in the design stakes, however, it could still give modern British mosques a run for their money. Despite the huge number of new mosques being built, few reach beyond the level of flimsy imitation. Often they&apos;re given a regional look to chime with the community they serve. The Suleymaniye mosque, in a strongly Turkish area of north-east London, has Ottoman-style minarets. In Leeds, the Makkah mosque, built for the mainly Pakistani diaspora, has south Asian accents, circa 1670. This kind of mosque-lite is a terrible missed opportunity. There&apos;s nothing awe-inspiring about a Barratt home, and these are the religious versions. An arabesque and a spot of mosaic work do not a decent building make. Like gable-roofed supermarkets or covered malls with half-timbered facades, the new mosques are eyesores, contributing nothing to the urban fabric. Sophisticated, contemporary, original mosque architecture could do so much to enhance it. The problem in the UK is partly lack of money - there&apos;s no central institution like the Vatican bankrolling mosque construction, and a relative shortage of mega-rich Muslims. More important though is a failure of imagination, the result of many community leaders&apos; thoroughly conservative outlook. Changing, letting fresh ideas in, might seem like losing touch with your roots. Look elsewhere and you&apos;ll find the malaise extends from Casablanca to Qatar and Malaysia. The regional template is just reproduced, whether it&apos;s Moorish, Ottoman, Gulf or Iranian. So is anyone trying anything new? The brief - open spaces for prayer, one for women, one for men, rooms for ritual washing, a pulpit and a niche aligned with Mecca - is remarkably simple; there&apos;s plenty of opportunity for experimentation and there have been some attempts to break the mould. Singapore is home to Forum Architects&apos; Assyafaah Mosque, a contemporary building in a city where contemporary interpretations of Islam also thrive. Strasbourg nearly got an entirely new kind of mosque courtesy of Zaha Hadid, but it was never built. And Pakistan&apos;s Shah Faisal Mosque, though grandiose, at least provides an alternative vision. But these are grand projects. Until there&apos;s a rethink about how small, local mosques are designed, I suggest we&apos;re going to be stuck with a whole lot of mediocrity."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/aug/05/property.malaysia", "sentences": ["Just 30 minutes from KL International airport and 90-minute drive from the capital, it is a popular weekend and seaside holiday destination for the capital&apos;s residents and also visitors from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-05T22:57:43Z", "title": "Malaysia, where the ocean view starts beneath your feet", "tags": ["Money", "Property", "Malaysia holidays"], "article": "The Malaysian government is very keen on tourists and foreign property investors at the moment. It has declared this year &apos;Visit Malaysia 2007&apos;: the goal being to attract more than 20 million tourists to the country - at least 2.5 million more than last year. And there is a second initiative in place, &apos;Malaysia My Second Home&apos;, to encourage longer-term visitors. While it takes a good 13 hours to fly to Malaysia from the UK, the journey is getting cheaper. Earlier this year, aviation tycoon Tony Fernandes - Malaysia&apos;s Richard Branson - who owns the no-frills long-haul airline Air Asia X announced he would soon be offering return flights from London to Kuala Lumpur for between \u00a341 and \u00a3231. Malaysia is in a particularly celebratory mood this year as August marks the 50th anniversary of its independence from the UK and there are plenty of special events marking the occasion. One reminder that remains of the colonial era is the coastal resort Port Dickson - one of the few places in the country to have retained a British name. Just 30 minutes from KL International airport and 90-minute drive from the capital, it is a popular weekend and seaside holiday destination for the capital&apos;s residents and also visitors from Singapore. Under British rule at the end of the 19th century, the port was used to transport tin ore - the country&apos;s biggest export at the time. But it soon became popular as a resort with British colonial officials and their families. Almost 100 years later, it had become so popular that the coast was crowded with hotels and apartments and the town entertained thousands of weekend visitors. Growing pollution and competition from other more pristine beaches on Malaysia&apos;s east coast saw it eventually fall out of favour in the 1990s. But there has recently been a major clean-up and it is on the up again. Part of the regeneration is a holiday complex called Banyan Curve, which includes &apos;water homes&apos; - chalets built on stilts over the sea. The complex is the brainchild of Dato Low Tak Fatt, a UK-educated barrister who is managing director of property developers Kuala Lumpur Metro Group. The chalets are being promoted in the UK by estate agents Barrasford and Bird, who are better known for their involvement in the Bulgarian property market. (That market has now become saturated and some investment buyers who thought they had guaranteed rental agreements have found they were false promises; however, Alan Bird insists his company was one of the earliest into Bulgaria and none of his buyers has been disappointed). The Malaysian properties, which Barrasford and Bird is selling for between \u00a375,912 and \u00a3124,088 fully furnished, are due for completion in December 2008. They can be bought for own-use, but most investors are buying them for rental. A &apos;guaranteed&apos; rental income of 8 per cent for three years is offered, followed by a 75 per cent profit sharing arrangement that, in theory, could produce higher returns if occupancy levels increase. Investment buyers also get 10 days&apos; free use of the property, not including weekends. Although these properties are described as &apos;homes&apos;, they are effectively hotel-style apartments with no cooking facilities or washing machines. They are part of a complex run by Legend, a Malaysia hotel group established in 1996. The charm of these apartments, which stand 15ft above the sea bed, is said to lie in the gentle sea breezes to which they are exposed. Each contains a tiny swimming/plunge pool. Some apartments are also located on the shore, but their view of the sea will be blocked by the chalets in front. Although Malaysia was relatively unscathed by the 2004 tsunami - it was protected from the main waves by the Indonesian island of Sumatra - the developers are offering annual insurance covering the chalets against damage from tsunamis, earthquakes and typhoons. \u00b7 Barrasford and Bird; bandbw.co.uk; 0845 600 1871"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/06/horseracing.sport", "sentences": ["He was third to Dylan Thomas in the Prix Ganay and I finished third on him in the Singapore Cup.&quot; Murtagh, meanwhile, may be reunited with Peeping Fawn in the Yorkshire Oaks on August 22."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-05T23:14:40Z", "title": "Horse racing: Red-hot Murtagh sets his sights on Arlington Million", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Johnny Murtagh"], "article": "Peeping Fawn, unraced as a two-year-old and beaten in her first three starts this season, maintained her staggering rate of improvement when successful in Saturday&apos;s Nassau Stakes at Goodwood. That was her third Group One win in a row, but the filly is still playing catch-up to the man on board for her last two wins. Johnny Murtagh is enjoying an amazing hot streak. His no-nonsense win on Peeping Fawn was the jockey&apos;s sixth Group One victory since the end of May. Murtagh had stacked up wins at the highest level on Notnowcato, Soldier&apos;s Tale and Simply Perfect before guiding Peeping Fawn to victory in last month&apos;s Irish Oaks as a prelude to securing King George VI and Queen Elizabeth honours on Dylan Thomas. Murtagh is halfway to matching the tally of 12 Group One wins worldwide he recorded in 2000. Next stop is the Arlington Million in Chicago on Saturday, when he rides Doctor Dino for French-based trainer Richard Gibson. &quot;Things are going well, all right,&quot; said Murtagh yesterday. &quot;I&apos;m getting on some nice horses and Peeping Fawn, she&apos;s special. I hit the front sooner than I wanted on Saturday but she just took me there. When you get a filly as good as that, there&apos;s no telling how far they can go.&quot; Peeping Fawn readily accounted for the high-class older French filly, Mandesha, in the Nassau where jockeyship played its part. While Murtagh was making his winning run, Christophe Soumillon, having his first ride at Goodwood, had Mandesha covered up at the back of the field. Mandesha ran on late to finish a clear second but had no hope of catching the winner. &quot;Goodwood isn&apos;t the easiest track to ride,&quot; said Murtagh. &quot;I should probably have won the maiden on Belgrave Square on Saturday. I went for a run up the inside, got blocked and had to move out. We were beaten a neck.&quot; If that was one that got away, Murtagh&apos;s mastery of Goodwood&apos;s twists and turns was all too evident when he steered Yellowstone to victory in Tuesday&apos;s Gordon Stakes, getting first run on the hapless Richard Hills aboard Aqaleem. That was the first leg of a Group 3 double for Murtagh on the opening day. He will be a notable absentee from the three-man team representing Ireland in the Shergar Cup, the international jockeys&apos; competition, at Ascot on Saturday. &quot;Richard Gibson is a nice fellow and I said I would ride Doctor Dino for him in the Arlington Million,&quot; said Murtagh. &quot;He&apos;s a top horse. He was third to Dylan Thomas in the Prix Ganay and I finished third on him in the Singapore Cup.&quot; Murtagh, meanwhile, may be reunited with Peeping Fawn in the Yorkshire Oaks on August 22. That race is also a possible target for Light Shift, third in the Nassau, but yesterday Alan Cooper, racing manager to the filly&apos;s owners the Niarchos Family, said: &quot;We&apos;ll take our time before confirming her next run. She is absolutely fine this morning but didn&apos;t enjoy the fast ground at Goodwood.&quot; Marchand D&apos;Or, fourth in the July Cup when Dutch Art was second, took his revenge on Peter Chapple-Hyam&apos;s colt in the Prix Maurice de Gheest at Deauville yesterday. Winning the race for the second year running, Freddie Head&apos;s sprinter charged down the outside of the field to collar Dutch Art, who held on for second. &quot;This is a very good horse and I would like to dedicate this win to my team as he is not an easy horse to handle,&quot; said Head. Coral pushed Dutch Art out to 7-1, from 9-2, for the Betfred Cup at Haydock. Sakhee&apos;s Secret, the July Cup winner, is 2-1 favourite.

Campus aims And so Cranfield, which also has campuses in Silsoe in Bedfordshire and Shrivenham in Wiltshire, has established its latest operation in the South Australian capital of Adelaide. The move is part of an international venture that education planners from both countries hope will eventually become a fully fledged campus. For now, it is set to offer short-term postgraduate degrees in defence management and technology, in conjunction with local academic institutions and distance learning courses administered from Britain and the university&apos;s new Adelaide office. Cranfield, which was established in 1946 as a college of aeronautics, is unusual among British academic institutions for taking only postgraduates, as well as being associated with a substantial airfield. The university enrols roughly 10% of the country&apos;s engineering postgraduates, and is recognised globally for its courses in defence and management. It has close ties with the defence industry and with the Ministry of Defence, under contract from which it runs its Defence College of Management and Technology. In terms of the proportion of research income it receives from private sources, &quot;we&apos;re head and shoulders above any other UK university by a factor of two, which shows our very, very close relations to the industry&quot;, says Professor Hugh Griffiths, the principal of the Defence College, a key player in the Adelaide negotiations, which also centre on the local defence industry. It was in 1996 that South Australia first identified higher education as a potentially lucrative source of revenue. Not only could elite foreign institutions bring new students to the geographically isolated city of Adelaide, the thinking went, but niche programmes would offer new opportunities for those already there, particularly those working in the city&apos;s state service, entertainment and defence sectors. The Singapore-style venture - so-called because of its similarities to the south-east Asian state&apos;s efforts during the same period to refashion itself as &quot;the Boston of the East&quot; - has evolved largely on the watch of the state&apos;s Labor party premier, Mike Rann, who was returned to office last year after campaigning largely on his educational achievements. Speaking at the signing of the Cranfield agreement, Rann paid tribute to the institution&apos;s close ties with the military &quot;and how their research and courses are designed and taught to cater for precise capability requirements&quot;. That, he noted, was &quot;exactly the model South Australia&apos;s burgeoning defence industry is following&quot;. In Canberra, the Australian national capital, such academic entrepreneurship has appealed to a federal government eager to welcome a new institution that, as well as having the right reputation, could help the country to expand its foreign student market. The government moved quickly to amend legislation that until late 2005 did not allow foreign universities to offer degrees in the country. Last year, Australia welcomed the country&apos;s first foreign higher education institution to its 39-strong university club: Carnegie Mellon, an American university with a reputation for excellence in science and technology. The country&apos;s 40th university now offers US degrees in entertainment technology and management studies to around 100, mainly foreign, students enrolled at its Adelaide branch, located in the same downtown premises as the new Cranfield operation. The American degrees on offer are the same as those already taught at the university&apos;s Pittsburgh location - as is their annual cost of between $30,000 and $50,000 (\u00a315,000-\u00a325,000). &quot;One of the things we knew, but which still came as a surprise, is the fact that, unlike many other parts of the world, students in Australia don&apos;t like to travel for their higher education,&quot; says Timothy Zak, the chief executive of Carnegie Mellon&apos;s Heinz school in Adelaide, reflecting on the challenges awaiting his British counterparts. &quot;While we certainly would like to recruit students outside Australia, we are still pretty under-represented in the country. &quot;Any time you set up a campus in another part of the world, our experience tells us, there will be a lot of effort required, not least when it comes to the idiosyncrasies of a culture and place. But Cranfield, being a university of high regard and reputation, will be a great addition, no doubt.&quot; Electronic warfare Cranfield&apos;s presence will initially be a relatively small one, limited to short-term programmes, typically enrolling up to 30 students apiece, divided between conventional face-to-face instruction and distance learning modes. The university has signed an agreement with the South Australian government to run two defence-related courses in integrated logistical support and electronic warfare at the University of Adelaide, as well as developing similar courses for the University of South Australia. Over time, the plan is to deliver more professional development courses, teaching modules and dual degrees, and to implement academic staff exchanges between universities and the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation. Cranfield is also exploring possible collaborations with Flinders and Carnegie Mellon. Still, foreign ventures opening their academic doors offshore can be a touchy subject in Australia, where publicly funded local institutions are perpetually strapped for cash and, in some cases, have been known to resent the cash incentives offered to the international newcomers. (The new British office&apos;s \u00a31m budget has been jointly underwritten by Cranfield and the South Australian government.) UNSW Asia, Australia&apos;s first attempt to establish its own offshore campus, in Singapore, recently went bust only months into its operation thanks to an enrolment slump and poor business planning. But, says Griffiths, the city&apos;s existing institutions &quot;have been very supportive. I think they recognise we have some very distinctive things to offer through our deep associations with defence and security - areas that universities do not normally have - and so they are keen to work with us. &quot;Clearly, anything we do has to be financially viable, so no, we wouldn&apos;t be doing it if it weren&apos;t making us a profit. But there are altruistic motives as well. We like to see ourselves as a player on the world stage, so it&apos;s good for us to be involved in other countries.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/08/international.mainsection1", "sentences": ["Mr Gore made the comments at a forum in Singapore and likened the campaign to that of the millions of dollars spent by US tobacco companies years ago on creating the appearance of uncertainty within the scientific community on the effects of smoking.", "Associated Press in Singapore"], "publicationDate": "2007-08-07T23:07:48Z", "title": "International news in brief", "tags": ["World news"], "article": "Poll win may end support for ally in Afghanistan  Japan&apos;s biggest opposition party yesterday installed its first president of parliament&apos;s upper house for more than 50 years and said it would oppose plans by the prime minister to continue support for US forces in Afghanistan.

Under the banner &quot;Moshe Feiglin - because he has a God&quot;, the much-maligned challenger hopes to overcome the heavily-stacked odds against him, wrest control of Likud, and turn it into a party of &quot;Jewish Law&quot;. The man convicted of sedition less than 10 years ago is back on centre stage this summer, and already causing tremors amongst the Netanyahu faithful. Statistics and hard facts come a distant second to other-worldy belief for Moshe Feiglin and his supporters. When Josh and I met him at his house last month, he was sanguine about his position in the polls, telling us: &quot;it might look bleak now, but miracles do happen - especially in Israel.&quot; Assuring us that he was only in Likud in order to &quot;steer it in a new direction,&quot; he spoke confidently of becoming prime minister of Israel in the future, and heralding in a new dawn of proud Jewish identity among its citizens. Years on the outside looking in has taken its toll on Feiglin&apos;s ability to trust others and court favour among his political colleagues. Speaking over his shoulder as he hung up his family&apos;s washing in their modest back garden, he told us casually that &quot;I don&apos;t care whether the other Likud politicians are nice to me or not. I see myself as part of their party, but with my own agenda entirely.&quot; When he first joined Likud, &quot;the others realised that I was a big force, and tried to draw me near to them - but, once they saw I was totally independent, they fought me and tried to keep me down.&quot; His star&apos;s ascent has proved difficult to halt, however. Coming third in the primaries 18 months ago, he is now the only real challenger to Netanyahu, and he has gone from 14% in the polls a month ago to almost 25% last week, sending alarm bells ringing in the Bibi camp. And, from what I gleaned during our hour-long interview, the sirens should be sounding far beyond the offices of the Likud Central Committee alone. His plans for Israel&apos;s future seemed fairly harmless - at first. &quot;Every child will have to study Jewish history,&quot; he said. &quot;They won&apos;t have a choice, just like you didn&apos;t have a choice learning maths and English when you were growing up.&quot; He spoke of reaffirming family values, sounding like the quintessential conservative politician, but quickly returned to his cause celebre: the purification of the Jewish state. He took aim at the &quot;half a million immigrants from the FSU who aren&apos;t even Jewish,&quot; getting more and more indignant as he spat out his words. &quot;Why was it so important to bring them all here in the first place?&quot; he asked. &quot;It&apos;s because they [the government] don&apos;t want Israel to be Jewish. There&apos;s a war in this country between two dreams - those who want a Jewish state and those who want a secular Israel.&quot; He cited Shimon Peres&apos;s declaration that Israel should be &quot;the Singapore of the Middle East&quot;, apparently meaning that the country &quot;should have no flavour of Judaism whatsoever&quot;. Feiglin&apos;s plan is to &quot;return the country to the people, 70% of whom see themselves as Jewish first and Israeli second.&quot; The right of return law should be severely tightened, he went on. Currently, anyone with one Jewish grandparent qualifies for citizenship but, according to Feiglin&apos;s plan, &quot;only those who the Torah says are Jewish will be allowed to come [ie only those whose mothers are Jewish].&quot; He was reaching his crescendo at this point, and I decided it was as good a point as any to try and burst his bubble. What about an Israeli man who marries a non-Jew and has a child, I asked, would Feiglin deny that child citizenship too? Flustered at the interruption, as well as at his inability to reply coherently, Feiglin stammered that &quot;I don&apos;t have all the answers yet, I don&apos;t have all the details. Maybe the child would have citizenship, maybe not ... I&apos;m just laying down principles for now, trying to point in the direction we should head.&quot; Going back to the &quot;Russian problem&quot;, he told us that he hoped &quot;many will convert, and that the others will understand that there is no place for them here and find their future somewhere else.&quot; Next in Feiglin&apos;s line of fire was, predictably, the Arab population of Israel. &quot;There&apos;s a state within a state growing here,&quot; he said, shaking his head sadly. &quot;We&apos;ve got to stop fooling ourselves, look in the mirror, and deal with the problem head on.&quot; He said that 60% of the territory within the Green Line is controlled by Arabs, &quot;who build where they want, take over more and more land, and we need to start explaining to them who this country belongs to&quot;. In Feiglin&apos;s utopia, the Arab population would only be allowed to vote in municipal elections, and would only be consulted in civic affairs, &quot;such as sewage&quot;. National security, and all the other concerns of parliament, would be the exclusive preserve of Jews - but not just Israeli Jews. Proposing a two-house system modelled on the United States, he said that the upper house &quot;would be elected by both Israeli Jews and Jews from all round the world, since Israel belongs to every Jew on this Earth, all of whom should have a say in how it operates.&quot; The family dog, Scud, was getting impatient for his afternoon walk, so we wrapped up the interview, with Feiglin saving his best for last. &quot;When Jews are proud of who they are, then the Arab problem will disappear,&quot; he assured us, rising from his chair and ushering us through the house to the front door. Another day, another diehard Jewish supremacist - and, for all that my Cif detractors castigate me for allegedly only showing the extreme side of Israel, the fact that Feiglin is Likud&apos;s number two leadership candidate is worryingly revealing of the state of the so-called middle ground."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/08/5", "sentences": ["Thanks to particularly buoyant markets in London, New York and Singapore, pre-tax profits rose 49.4% to \u00a353.5m in the first half of 2007."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-08T14:06:16Z", "title": "City worried after another chief checks out of M&C", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Hotels chain Millennium &amp; Copthorne unnerved the City yesterday with the news that its second chief executive in a year was leaving because of disagreements over his management style.

Yesterday he said that the board had not envisaged such a different management style. Mr Papas, a former banker and board member of South African hotel group Peermont Global, left against a backdrop of strong results for Millennium &amp; Copthorne. Thanks to particularly buoyant markets in London, New York and Singapore, pre-tax profits rose 49.4% to \u00a353.5m in the first half of 2007.

Officials at the US Department of Transportation must appreciate that their decision to fund mayor Michael Bloomberg&apos;s visionary project, called PlaNYC, will determine the quality of air that more than 10 million New Yorkers breathe daily and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions the city coughs into the atmosphere. Already, New York City produces more CO2 emissions than all of Norway. More importantly, officials must realise that their actions will shape America&apos;s response to the global challenge of unparalleled urbanisation and carbon-induced climate change. This year, for the first time in human history, more people will live in urban areas than rural communities. In the US, the urban population has grown from 97 million in 1950 to 222 million in 2000. Today, nearly 80% of Americans live in urban areas. Such unprecedented and unplanned urbanisation wreaks environmental havoc by increasing carbon emissions, since higher population density results in greater automobile and energy use. PlaNYC encourages the use of public transportation systems by creating powerful disincentives to automobile use. The plan&apos;s proposed congestion charge on automobile use during peak times in certain parts of the city would reduce traffic and generate revenue that would go towards improving public transportation. Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s plan comes at the right time for a city burdened by worsening traffic and pollution problems. Vehicles cause nearly a fifth of New York City&apos;s CO2 emissions. Traffic congestion, in particular, is not only environmentally detrimental; it also imposes substantial time and resource costs on drivers. Americans lose around 3.7 billion hours and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel sitting in traffic jams. This implies an annual cost of around $200 billion. Due to congestion, New Yorkers face the longest commutes in the US, and their children have the highest rate of asthma hospitalisation. PlaNYC would impose the congestion charge on the 4.6% of New York City residents who drive to work, while its benefits would accrue to everyone. New Yorkers would enjoy cleaner air, shorter average commuting time, and better public transportation. Neither the economy in general, nor the retail sector in particular, should be adversely affected. In fact, service and delivery providers in Manhattan, among others, would benefit from shorter travel times and fewer delays. However, despite its many advantages, congestion charges face some skepticism. Fortunately, we can learn from other cities such as Stockholm, Singapore, and London, which have successfully implemented them. In all of these cities, CO2 emissions declined sharply and congestion was significantly reduced, with Singapore experiencing an immediate 45% drop in traffic. These cities have also benefited from more efficient public transportation. In London, bus-travel rose by 46%. According to an independent report, almost 60% of the businesses in London judged the programme&apos;s impact on the economy as positive or neutral. Automobile-dependent countries like America need smart solutions to ensure environmentally sustainable development. Having one of the largest urban populations and the highest per capita CO2 emissions, the US has the responsibility - and the means - to lead the world on this front. If the US does not act soon, American cities will lag behind not only European capitals, but also cities in developing countries such as Bogota (Colombia) and Curitiba (Brazil), which are already implementing innovative environmentally friendly solutions. New York City has always been a global leader in finance, the arts, and many other fields. It is an ideal candidate for creating a blueprint for cleaner and more efficient urbanisation in the US and the world.

It can only be the work of Sir Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin, which rarely spares a dime or two in cultivating its irreverent, risqu\u00e9 reputation. Gladhanding VIPs furiously, Branson was on exuberant form as his long planned domestic carrier, Virgin America, took off this week. Rod Stewart&apos;s ex-wife, Rachel Hunter, lent star appeal alongside the Californian band Cold War Kids. The mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, was even persuaded to don a pair of comical red spectacles for the occasion. In a sliver of bad luck, the airline&apos;s inaugural flight from New York was delayed by abysmal weather - but it was a fairly exceptional morning: the borough of Brooklyn was hit by its first tornado in 118 years. Traffic gridlock meant that the political satirist Stephen Colbert missed the flight - a bit unfortunate, since the plane was due to be named &quot;Air Colbert&quot; in his honour. Branson has founded four airlines - the long-haul carrier Virgin Atlantic, the Australian operation Virgin Blue, the African regional airline Virgin Nigeria and now Virgin America. It emerged this week that the group is set to make an investment in an Asian long-haul budget carrier, Air Asian Xpress. In the past, he has murmured about setting up an airline in India. So what is the long-term goal? Lieutenants of Branson suggest that eventually, the pieces could be put together to form a formidable global network of air travel in a single airline - perhaps simply Virgin Airways. That&apos;s almost impossible at the moment because of the aviation industry&apos;s interminable red tape which severely restricts cross-border ownership. And there are other obstacles - Branson has surrendered control of Virgin Blue, although he has been agitating to buy a majority stake from Australia&apos;s Toll Holdings. The big piece missing is a short-haul carrier in Europe. An early attempt, Virgin Express, was not a roaring success - partly because it never penetrated Heathrow - and it was eventually swallowed by Belgium&apos;s SN Brussels Airlines. Branson has made no secret of his desire to fill that gap by purchasing BMI when its founder, Sir Michael Bishop, eventually decides to cash in his legacy. The bearded entrepreneur has certainly shown that he is among a select few in the world who know how to make money out of aviation. Virgin Atlantic reported profits of \u00a341m in the year to February 2006 - double the amount the previous year. And Branson has pulled off some shrewd moves - not least of which was selling a 49% stake to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m eight years ago in a price which now looks a far better deal for Virgin than for its minority partner. According to Branson&apos;s venture capital partner Cyrus Capital, there are expectations that Virgin America will break into profit within 18 months to two years - which will be a remarkable feat, given that the US aviation industry recently lost $32bn in four years. In common with Virgin&apos;s other airlines, the US carrier has some clever quirks. Self-service drinks are a good idea, as is a system letting passengers order food on their seat-back screens. The state-of-the-art entertainment systems not only include TV and movies but a feature allowing passengers to create a playlist from 3,000 songs which can be downloaded on an MP3 player and taken away on landing. There are some tantalising hints of what is to come. According to one blogger who was on the inaugural flight, laptops can pick up a yet-to-be-launched wireless internet system called &quot;secretva1&quot;. Some customers, however, are pleased by more mundane details. In an eBay auction, businessman David Loewy paid $5,400 for a return ticket (economy class) on Virgin America&apos;s first coast-to-coast flight. So what feature was he most impressed by?

Surely the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street had not fallen asleep on the job, pundits asked? But the reason for the Bank&apos;s reticence was that last year it introduced a new money market system under which it has a permanent, unlimited standing facility available to commercial banks for them to draw on if they want to. It charges a rate above the prevailing Bank interest rate and currently any bank wanting to use the standing facility would have to pay 6.75% for funds - one percentage point over base. According to the Bank&apos;s latest announcement yesterday, no one had dipped into the facility at all during the frantic market activity on Thursday, although it was not clear as to whether anyone had yesterday. The European Central Bank and US Federal Reserve, as well as a number of Asian central banks, all provided tens of billions of dollars to ensure that the wheels of the money markets did not seize up, whereas the Bank of England has in effect introduced an &quot;auto-lube&quot; system. Those other central banks injected funds at below their current base rates to attract banks to use them. The Bank of England, though, sets a higher rate so banks will only use them if they really need to. And when they do use it, the Bank of England gets a vital early warning signal about which institutions may be in trouble - information which is not available to the central banks who shower cheap money on all banks indiscriminately. Central banks maintain a vital function in their economies by keeping the banking system working properly, ensuring the smooth lending and borrowing between banks that occurs every working day. The Bank of England uses the money market to transmit the interest rate policy of the monetary policy committee and to meet the liquidity needs of the banking system, thus ensuring its stability. In the current turmoil many commercial banks are worried about the effects on their balance sheets and have decided to hold more cash than they otherwise would, hence the draw on the money markets&apos; available funds. What prompted the interventions from the central banks was that overnight money interest rates shot up this week because cash was scarce. In other words, the price of money rose because it was in short supply. As of late yesterday, it appeared that the massive injections of funds in the US, Europe and beyond had had the effect of pushing those overnight rates back down again, relieving the pressure on the banking system, for now at least.

For African-American males, it is even shorter: 69.8. Jim McDermott, a Democratic Congressman, said: &quot;Health care coverage is the single biggest domestic crisis facing America. It threatens all but the wealthiest Americans. &quot;If you aren&apos;t part of the richest 1%, then you know you are living one phone call, accident or illness away from financial ruin because of a medical crisis.&quot; Obesity is frequently cited as among the causes of lower life expectancy. Almost a third of US adults are obese, according to the National Centre for Health Statistics, which compared US life expectancy with the rest of the world. Paul Terry, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta, said: &quot;The US has the resources that allow people to get fat and lazy.&quot; The drop is also due to improved health care, nutrition and lifestyle elsewhere in the world. Countries with longer life expectancy include most of Europe, Japan, Singapore and Jordan. The US also has a higher infant mortality rate than many other countries: 6.8 deaths for every 1,000 live births. The worst life expectancy figures are in Africa, with Swaziland at the bottom, at 34.1 years."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/14/india.technology", "sentences": ["&quot;It may not be here when you next come.&quot; In 10 years, people say (and perhaps hope), the city will look like Dubai or Singapore.", "This new middle class has cars and takes holidays abroad (eight days in Singapore for \u00a3150)."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-14T08:40:54Z", "title": "The making of a miracle", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Technology"], "article": "One early morning in Bangalore - at about six, before the traffic thickened and made the timing of any cross-town journey the subject of doubting speculation - an enterprising young man called Arun Pai took me in his car to the edge of the Karnataka Golf Association course, where he asked his driver to stop. On one side, greens and bunkers. On the other, big new buildings coated in glass and occupied by IBM, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs. &quot;I always take my foreign clients here,&quot; Pai said, &quot;and ask them to tell me which famous author stood almost in the same position.&quot; Many people have no difficulty. The answer is Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist and author of The World is Flat, and this is the setting of his book&apos;s first sentence, when Friedman is about to swing from the first tee and his partner tells him: &quot;Aim at either Microsoft or IBM.&quot; As a first sentence it hardly ranks with &quot;The past is a foreign country ...&quot;, but Friedman&apos;s book, the world&apos;s most popular gospel of globalisation, has sold 3m copies. It takes its several heroes from the IT business; one of them is Nandan Nilekani, co-chairman of the Indian software company Infosys, who gets the credit for inspiring the title by insisting to Friedman in 2004: &quot;Tom, the playing field is being levelled.&quot; But you might say that its real hero is Bangalore, or Bangalore as Friedman sees it: the leading example of how a city populated by clever, ambitious, English-speaking technicians in what is still known as the developing world can use the tools of the new information age to abolish geography - to undercut European and American costs so much, with no (or better) effect on quality, that it destroys the historic advantages of adjacency, when the counting house was best placed next to the warehouse and the warehouse next to the factory. The 600 pages of Friedman&apos;s book radiate a gung-ho optimism, and perhaps for that reason it is more widely read in India, a country that for most of the 20th century suffered the pessimistic prognoses of the outside world, than in Britain. To look for a British equivalent you might have to go back to Samuel Smiles and his Victorian testaments to hard work and self-help and his glorification of the great engineers. As I went around Bangalore this month I often thought of Smiles and the first industrial revolution - of its ruthlessness and chaos, its model factories and choked sewers, its slums and philanthropists, yet running through its new kind of people, freshly urbanised and adapting to the factory clock, the thread of a belief that they were at the centre of a new kind of world. Arun Pai, my guide that morning, is an example of this new kind of person, or new at least in India. Inspired by the walking tours of London, he created a small company, bangalorewalks.com, and every Sunday he leads groups of people through the history of the city as manifested in its monuments, churches, parks and barracks. At this, he is quite brilliant; from plain and obscure objects he can draw stories that take you to Napoleon and the conquest of Everest. To listen to him, Bangalore has been affecting the course of global history ever since Lord Cornwallis took it from Tipu Sultan in 1791. But walking tours aren&apos;t how Pai makes his real money. That comes when a software company, usually American, asks him to introduce one of its newly arrived executives to India: the bewildering totality of it. Pai has a one-day course. He takes them in his car to the famous Friedman site, to the ancient Hindu temple behind the new Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s, to the new suburbs and shopping malls. He may recall a few recent cultural references, such as the American passive verb, to be &quot;Bangalored&quot;, meaning to lose one&apos;s job to cheaper competition overseas. He can do Hinduism in five minutes. Most of the questions are about cows, but beggars and caste are also popular topics. He has persuasive answers for the innocent from Kansas, and to demonstrate and sharpen his skills he asked me to ask him any question at all about noticeable aspects of India. I asked why it was that Indian advertising never depicted any human being with a skin shade darker than olive, when so many of the population, especially in the south, were by no means so light. Pai said that it was just a local edition of a universal fact: the enduring appeal of whiteness. But he agreed that this answer might not satisfy an American executive who happened to be black, or indeed anyone from a society that has adjusted to multiculturalism in way that India, for all its divisions of religion, language and caste, has not. Later that Sunday morning, Pai took a group of us along the city&apos;s main thoroughfare, MG (Mahatma Gandhi) Road, in search of bungalows. The Victorian bungalow and its shady garden were once the trademarks of Bangalore - &quot;India&apos;s garden city&quot;. Only a few survive. Land is too valuable and its price increases every week. &quot;Take pictures, take pictures,&quot; Pai said when we stood in front of one. &quot;It may not be here when you next come.&quot; In 10 years, people say (and perhaps hope), the city will look like Dubai or Singapore. Some of it already does. Go back 60 years. Does the story of Bangalore&apos;s rise symbolise the larger history of independent India? Yes and no. In 1947, Bangalore contained about 500,000 people and has about six million now; the fifth largest city in India. In the same period, India&apos;s population, now 1.12 billion, has multiplied by a factor of three rather than Bangalore&apos;s 12, but urban growth rates that are much higher than the national average aren&apos;t unusual. When I first came to Bangalore in 1976, I didn&apos;t feel I&apos;d left India behind. The same restrictions on consumption, the same brakes to aspiration, applied as much here as anywhere else in the country. Under the regime of Indira Gandhi (and of her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, before her), the Indian middle class grew to a kind of noble austerity in the cause of national self-reliance. On the other hand, even then, Bangalore was clearly exceptional. It was tidier, neater, greener, English was more readily spoken, a striking number of church towers poked above the trees in a country where, outside the far south, Christianity had made very little impact. Above all, there was (and is) the climate. Bangalore is 3,000ft above sea level, protected by its height from the enervating heat; the British called it a &quot;no-fan station&quot;. When I asked Nandan Nilekani of Infosys how he explained the IT industry&apos;s attraction to Bangalore he made all these points - &quot;It&apos;s the most middle-class, Anglicised, cosmopolitan city in India, with a better quality of life&quot; - and added another: that a scientific and technical tradition already existed in the city, thanks to the aircraft and electrical instruments businesses that the government of India located there in the 1950s and 60s, militarily strategic factories that were as far away as possible from the borders of Pakistan and China, India&apos;s potential enemies. During the 1980s, even before economic liberalisation, it became known as the fastest-growing city in Asia. It is also, as the historian Ramachandra Guha says, a mongrel kind of town: the only place in India where you can watch films in six Indian languages. Partly, this is British doing. After Cornwallis dethroned Tipu Sultan and restored the kingdom of Mysore to its former Hindu rulers, the British built an army cantonment on the high ground outside the gates of Bengaluru, which in the local language, Kannada, was the name of the town they had captured. The cantonment grew in size to become a &quot;civil and military station&quot; which drew thousands of Tamil craftsmen, tradesmen and servants, as well as Persian horse traders and British civil servants and brewers. A large Anglo-Indian population became established. Missionaries opened schools, a great park was laid out, exotic trees imported, courts and administrative offices built. The lingua franca of this new town, Bangalore, was English; just down the road in the narrow lanes of Bengaluru they continued to speak in Kannada. The two towns became one municipality in 1949, but the differences between them persist. In Bangalore, I met men in their early middle-age, raised in the old city, who said that until their late teens they had never travelled the mile to the cantonment; and who had been warned by their parents that, when they did, they had better avoid the temptations of bars and hotels. Bangalore became the capital of the new state of Mysore (since 1973, Karnataka) when the Indian state boundaries were redrawn in 1956. The official language of Karnataka is Kannada. But thanks to the successive flows of migrants from other Indian states, only about 30% of Bangalore&apos;s inhabitants claim it as their first language. That means the city has no dominant majority, a welcoming absence as far as new migrants and businesses are concerned but a fretful one for the native Kannada speaker, who, if he lacks English, may feel excluded from the new consumer culture of his own capital city. Consequently, in what some Bangaloreans consider a political sop to the natives, Bangalore will be renamed Bengaluru within the next year or two. When it appears in airline timetables and on departure boards, a stranger might imagine that the new, more Indian name reflects a new, more Indian reality on the ground. But the opposite will be the case. A good way to understand what has happened to Bangalore is to look at a street map. In the old city, the Kannada names, many centuries old, come from castes and occupations and bazaars. In the cantonment, the source of the names is obvious enough: Brigade Road, Infantry Road, Church Street. Then, to judge from the parentheses, a burst of patriotic renaming took place - Sir Mirza Ismail Nagar (Richmond Town), Field Marshall Cariappa Road (Residency Road) - though to no effect on how people think and speak of these places. In the suburban spread of the 1960s and 70s, the streets renounce any claim to history or romance, as though Stalin was in charge of the naming department. In Indiranagar, named after Indira Gandhi, the main street is One Hundred Feet Road: that is its width. Many streets are simply numbered, as are localities: a visitor can spend many hours in an auto-rickshaw looking for 597, 15th Cross Road, JPNagar Phase Two. But now that anonymity, these plain square houses in their numbered streets, no longer satisfies new money. The names and architecture of the most recent settlements, high-rises and gated communities could be described as postmodern or pre-post-colonial: Buckingham Court, Windsor Residency, Palm Meadows, 10 Downing Street. Some quite small houses have castellated battlements. The word &quot;Residency&quot;, the title the British gave to the homes of senior imperial administrators, is very popular. &quot;People here speak of &apos;get-up&apos;,&quot; an architect told me as we had dinner in a hotel. &quot;They say to each other, &apos;What kind of get-up is your new house going to have? Mediterranean? English Castle?&apos; They think they can do anything - anything! - and they want to shove it in your face.&quot; In the hotel bar, young Bangalorean men were braying and drinking - the sound carried across the hotel gardens. They weren&apos;t poor; this was an expensive hotel. A phrase that the former Sunday Telegraph editor Peregrine Worsthorne coined in the red-braces 1980s came to me: bourgeois triumphalism. I came to Bangalore a few times in the 1980s and stayed in the homes of my then father-in-law, first in Indiranagar and then in the old Anglo-Indian colony of Whitefield. The sights and sounds I associate with these places were, and in most places still are, common to all India. You would go to sleep to the sound of the chowkidar, the night watchman, tapping his stick and blowing his pea whistle. In the morning there would be the cawing of crows and the cries of an early street pedlar, selling vegetables from a stall on wheels. Sometimes an occasional car would honk. The Whitefield house is now a restaurant, the Eurochine, and in Indiranagar they are tearing down 30-year-old houses all the way down the Hundred Feet Road to make way for the stores of the global brands: Benetton, Nike, Levis. Cars queue impatiently down every street and turning. It does no good to be wistful. A bright young science graduate can expect a starting salary of at least 270,000 rupees (about \u00a33,400) a year as a software engineer, and within a year or two will be earning far more than the professor who taught him. Between 200,000 and 300,000 people work in Bangalore&apos;s IT industry and not all of them will be so prosperous; call-centres, now referred to dismissively as IT&apos;s &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;, pay far less. The great majority, however, will earn far more than their parents. Rent and property are expensive - at the top end, a Bangalore flat can cost \u00a31m - but credit is cheap. This new middle class has cars and takes holidays abroad (eight days in Singapore for \u00a3150). The very rich have servants and a manager to manage them. A servant - a driver, a cook - can double his salary by learning English. If the new recruit joins Infosys, which has become India&apos;s most applauded company, he or she will travel each day to a &quot;campus&quot; at Electronic City, which has a putting green, an orchard, a swimming pool, free bikes to get around, and a canteen that serves 14 different cuisines (one of them Jain, which omits garlic and onions). In recent years, more foreign chief executives and heads of state have visited this campus than the Taj Mahal, or so it is said, and &quot;the Infosys tour&quot; has become a cliche of books and TV documentaries. And of course, after getting out of your golf buggy and ascending one of the taller buildings, you can look out through the plate glass and see the slums beyond the fence, where a small boy is defecating next to a stray dog and the ditch runs black. India: land of contrasts. But supposing this replica of Silicon Valley were to disappear? The slum, the stray dog, the black ditch, the defecating child - all these would still be there. Philanthropy is popular. Infosys has a foundation devoted to good works. Quite separately, Nandan Nilekani&apos;s wife, Rohini, estimates she has spent about $40m (\u00a320m) of their money on children&apos;s educational and water projects, mainly in village India, over the past few years. This is a lot. Then again, her husband is one of Infosys&apos;s seven founders. When the company went public in 1993, 100 shares cost 9,500 rupees. The same shares today would be worth 24,440,000 rupees, 3,000 times their flotation value. (Many more people have benefited than the founders; stock options were once given to all employees, who now number about 80,000.) &quot;It&apos;s just no use being an island of prosperity in this country, it isn&apos;t going to work,&quot; Rohini Nilekani said when I went to see her in her charity&apos;s office, and in that statement hover two large black clouds. The first is inadequate, sometimes collapsing, infrastructure: roads, railways, sewers, drinking water, schools, electricity. The second is the growing divide between urban and rural India. Despite increasing urbanisation, about 70% of the population still live in agricultural villages. The reverse side of the economic liberalisation that made India&apos;s software industry possible is the crisis of Indian agriculture. Poor crop prices, exhausted soil, expensive fertiliser, falling water tables, and land that needs to sustain too many livelihoods: so far this year 1,000 Karnataka farmers are said to have killed themselves. And yet the odd thing, the thing that a more curious American executive might ask their guide, Arun Pai, is: given that the price (80 rupees, about \u00a31) of a six-minute local call from my grand hotel surpasses the daily wage of the sugar-cane cutter in a field a few miles away, how come there is so little anger and unrest in Bangalore? The best answer to this question came from another software entrepreneur, Subroto Bagchi, who runs MindTree Consulting (its clients include Avis and Royal Mail). I went to see him at his house. He offered tea and when I said yes, went away to make it and brought it on a tray himself - striking behaviour; never before, in 30 years&apos; experience of India, have I ever seen any Indian man of above average wealth do anything so humbly domestic. Bagchi, like many other Indian IT success stories, likes to stress his middle-class origins, a term that has a more egalitarian implication in India than in Britain. Indian businesses in the past tended to be run by caste-based dynasties, with money and trading (as well as political) know-how inherited by succeeding generations. Bagchi&apos;s father, on the other hand, worked as a government officer in a remote, un-electrified district of Orissa State; Nilekani&apos;s father managed a textile mill; village postmen, teachers and railway ticket-collectors appear proudly in the biographies of others. According to Bagchi, it demonstrates the truth of the saying that the Indian IT business succeeded &quot;not because who we knew but because what we knew&quot; and having to compete in a global market without political protection. I asked about the prospects of discontent, given the disparities of wealth in Bangalore. Bagchi said: &quot;Tell me, where is the angst, where is the senseless killing? They&apos;re not even restless. They&apos;re not just content, they&apos;re quite grateful. Most people, labourers, maidservants, are making a better living. It doesn&apos;t occur to my driver that he has every right to be as well-dressed as I am. Just doesn&apos;t occur to him. You have to understand, we don&apos;t have a sense of urgency, our civilisation is 3,600 years old. For most Indians, it&apos;s been an upgrade from coach to business class. They&apos;re grateful to be where they are&quot;. \u00b7 Ian Jack began writing about India as a foreign correspondent in 1977 and lived for a time in Delhi and Calcutta.

The former leader, who was deposed in a bloodless coup last September while abroad, has been living in exile in London and failed to appear before a hearing scheduled to begin today. A nine-judge panel of Thailand&apos;s supreme court ordered the telecoms billionaire and his wife, Pojaman, to be produced before the court at the next hearing set for September 25.  Prosecutors said afterwards that if Mr Thaksin - who recently acquired Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m - failed to appear by the new deadline then extradition proceedings would be considered. However, an extradition request to British authorities would have virtually no hope of success. British law has no equivalent to that with which Mr Thaksin, 57, is being charged under Thai legislation. The couple are accused of being involved in a \u00a311.1m land deal to buy a prime piece of Bangkok real estate in 2003 while Mr Thaksin was prime minister, in contravention of laws barring serving officials and politicians from engaging in business with state enterprises. In the wake of the coup an &quot;assets examination committee&quot; set up by the military-appointed government investigated the land purchase from an arm of the Bank of Thailand at an auction, during which other bidders dropped out. If convicted Mr Thaksin faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of \u00a3900. The committee is demanding the purchase be set aside, the land returned and the money confiscated. The former prime minister&apos;s lawyer, Pichit Cheunban, argued that because of the political uncertainty in Thailand it was not safe from his client to return, though his wife has travelled in and out of the country often. The lawyer appealed to the judge that Mr Thaksin&apos;s reappearance in Thailand would merely destabilise the fragile political situation ahead of elections that the coup leaders have promised by December. He added that it would be impossible for Mr Thaksin to receive a fair trial while the junta was still in control and urged that the case be postponed until next year, or until at least a month after the elections. &quot;I have talked with my two clients and we agree that the best timing for them to return to fight the case is after the election,&quot; Mr Pichit said after the ruling. &quot;We reiterate that the current situation is still not good for their safety and we have no desire to see disunity in the country.&quot; In his initial reaction to the Thai court&apos;s decision, Mr Thaksin gave a non-committal response in an email to the Associated Press. &quot;I am aware of the decision in Thailand,&quot; he said in a statement released by a public relations company. &quot;I shall consult with my legal advisers and make an announcement in due course.&quot;  The army chief, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who led the coup, gave an assurance that Mr Thaksin&apos;s safety would be guaranteed if he returned, directly contradicting an earlier statement that the former prime minister might be at risk from his enemies.  &quot;The [national security council] has to be responsible and the government has to ask the police to take care of it with the military playing a supporting role,&quot; he said. &quot;There should not be any problem for him to return. Everything has gone in accordance with the asset examination committee and court process.&quot;  Since June almost \u00a31bn of Mr Thaksin&apos;s assets have been frozen in Thai bank accounts. The tycoon was already a wealthy businessman before he secured two terms in office between 2001 and 2006. But the tax-free sale of his telecoms empire to the Singapore government investment arm in 2006 sparked mass street protests that led to his eventual downfall. The Thai military, which justified its takeover on the grounds that Mr Thaksin was corrupt, vilified the former prime minister, but took almost eight months to lay the first charges."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/14/india.randeepramesh", "sentences": ["My Indian cousins, who had diligently studied science subjects, began to leave India for jobs with management consultants and computer companies in places such as Singapore and California."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-14T22:49:51Z", "title": "'I've witnessed the arrival of  a golden age'", "tags": ["India", "World news"], "article": "A few years ago, I visited an Indian software millionaire at his headquarters in Bangalore for a story about the country&apos;s effervescent computer industry. Software is modern India&apos;s spice, a precious commodity craved by the rest of the world. The businessman took great pleasure in showing me around. I marvelled at rows of programmers working in Japanese; I gawped at the basketball courts and pizza eateries imported to give the company an authentic Silicon Valley feel. After an hour or two, the conversation got personal. In the unselfconscious, no-nonsense manner of many educated Indians, the entrepreneur quizzed me on which university I had gone to (Cambridge) and the subject I had studied (physics), before triumphantly declaring that I had been &quot;born in the wrong country&quot;. When I protested, he raised his palm. &quot;The British system has come to this - taking scientists and making them journalists,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;What a waste. Just imagine the opportunities you missed by not being born here.&quot; In my youth I would have laughed that comment away as misplaced optimism in a country that could not even get its trains to run on time. I had grown up shuttling between my birthplace, London, and India, my parents&apos; homeland. My earliest memories revolved around the open sewers and the endless slumlands of my father&apos;s Mumbai, or Bombay as it was then known, and the tropical sloth of my mother&apos;s home in Kerala. It is fair to say that nothing worked in the India of yesterday. There were phones, but the lines were mostly dead. Frequent blackouts meant the inside of the fridge was invariably hotter than the air outside it. India appeared to be a place that, like my grandfather&apos;s battered Fiat, went faster backwards than forwards. I spent my childhood apologising for having any connections with India, a country that in my lofty opinion needed major surgery. But a decade ago, while the rest of the world was looking the other way, India reached some kind of tipping point, and change began to happen - fast. The signs were easy to spot. By the mid-90s, the Marks &amp; Spencer underwear and ovenproof CorningWare dishes my parents had always brought as gifts for relatives were politely returned, or left unopened. &quot;We can buy this here,&quot; sniffed my auntie in Bangalore. My Indian cousins, who had diligently studied science subjects, began to leave India for jobs with management consultants and computer companies in places such as Singapore and California. Friends in Britain started to climb the social ladder by having arranged marriages with Indian women who were often smarter, more sophisticated and better-looking than they perhaps deserved. Since I pitched up in 2003 to live and work in Delhi, I have witnessed firsthand the arrival of a golden age. The making and spending of money has become respected in a country where poverty was once revered. Middle-income westerners now feel poor in the upmarket postcodes of India&apos;s big cities. Yet it would be wrong to think that India has become just like everywhere else. Yes, an economic miracle is under way. Yes, there is now an elite as capable as any in the west. The paradox is that this is a modernising nation, but one still steeped in myth and legend. Indians tend to ascribe the country&apos;s rise to its unique, ancient civilisation and in the process tend to be rather dismissive of anywhere else. This does tend to blind Indians to the real problems faced by the country. Venality abounds, and the widespread acceptance of corruption tarnishes the pride that Indians take in their most tangible achievement - democracy - and saps the energy with which they express it. The abuse of public office for private profit reaches comical proportions in India. Family connections, privileges of caste and a pathological willingness to break the law characterise many social relations. In the dirt-poor state of Bihar, I once visited a local politician, in jail awaiting trial for numerous murders; he was campaigning from behind bars for re-election. Mobile phones and lime juice were brought by the guards as we spoke; they bowed in deference to my thuggish interviewee. Hanging in the air, too, is desperate poverty. To the naked eye, India appears not just an underdeveloped society, but an extremely unjust one. There are 260 million poor people in the country, and more than 1,000 children die of diarrhoea every day. The capital&apos;s streets are lined with ragged children and beggars waving handless stumps. Every day 22 farmers in India commit suicide. Official poverty numbers are going down, but not fast enough for anyone to notice. Yet the flow of good news keeps on coming. A top news story here last week was about a Punjabi businessman spending 1.55m rupees (\u00a320,000) on a bespoke mobile phone number. Living in India sometimes feels like living in the midst of a cult, with hundreds of millions of souls convinced of the country&apos;s inevitable rise to global, nuclear-armed power. The nation&apos;s privileged classes and castes have been gripped by a psychology of ascendancy, anticipating the greatness that imperialism and the cold war denied them. In fact, development for most Indians is a state of mind. Many simply sweep aside doubts by asserting the supremacy of the country&apos;s customs and traditions. I have heard my own family here in India discuss people with contempt just because of their background - be it class, caste, race or religion. When I protest, they simply tell me that I am not an Indian, so how could I understand? During my time here, I have come to realise that Indians have little interest in the British now, or in a British Asian like me who has returned to his parents&apos; land. My affinities with the country, too, have their limits. I have come to realise that despite a common heritage there is little I share in experience or beliefs with the millions here. America, the first British colony to break free, is the model now. Long gone is the view that Britain is a country to be admired or emulated.

With Sky&apos;s main Sunday match, Manchester United v Reading, attracting 1.3 million viewers and Setanta&apos;s first offering, Aston Villa v Liverpool, just under 400,000, the BBC feels there is life in the highlights format yet, despite Sky&apos;s Football First and BT Vision offering extended highlights from every Saturday match at the same time. Cast change The Premier League has made another signing from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport with Amy Casterton, formerly private secretary to Richard Caborn and currently filling the same role with the new sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, moving to Gloucester Place as the new head of public policy. Casterton joins the head of public affairs, Bill Bush, a former special adviser to Tessa Jowell, and press officer Tim Vine, formerly in the same role at DCMS. The move demonstrates an increasing focus on maintaining a favourable political climate in the wake of the record \u00a32.7bn TV deal that began this season. Third-party insurance With the dust settling on the Carlos Tevez affair the Premier League has another third-party ownership deal to unravel as Everton attempt to secure Manuel Fernandes from Benfica. The Portuguese club own 50% of his economic rights, with the other half owned by agents thought to include Pini Zahavi. Everton have sought Premier League advice on how to seal the deal and will pay Benfica \u20ac9m (\u00a36.1m) for 50% of the economic rights. This will be sufficient to secure his registration as long as the Premier League is satisfied the agents are prevented from exerting undue influence over the club in relation to Fernandes.

The former leader, who recently acquired Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m, was deposed in a bloodless coup in September while he was abroad. He has since been living in exile in London and failed to appear before a hearing scheduled to begin yesterday. The nine-judge panel of Thailand&apos;s supreme court ordered the telecoms billionaire and his wife, Pojaman, to be produced before the court at the next hearing scheduled for September 25. Prosecutors said afterwards that if Mr Thaksin failed to appear by the new deadline then extradition proceedings would be considered. However, an extradition request to British authorities would have virtually no hope of success. British law has no charge equivalent to that which Mr Thaksin, 57, is facing under Thai legislation. Foreign governments are also usually reluctant to extradite former heads of state where there are suspicions of political persecution. The couple are accused of being involved in a \u00a311.1m land deal to buy a prime piece of Bangkok real estate in 2003 while Mr Thaksin was prime minister, in contravention of laws barring serving officials and politicians engaging in business with state enterprises. In the wake of the coup, an &quot;assets examination committee&quot; established by the military-appointed government investigated the purchase of land from an arm of the Bank of Thailand at an auction in which other bidders dropped out. If convicted, Mr Thaksin faces up to 10 years in jail. The committee is demanding the purchase be set aside, the land returned and the money confiscated. The former prime minister&apos;s lawyer, Pichit Cheunban, argued that because of the political uncertainty in Thailand it was not safe for his client to return, though his wife has travelled in and out of the country often and is currently in London. The lawyer argued that Mr Thaksin&apos;s reappearance in Thailand would merely destabilise the fragile political situation ahead of elections that the coup leaders have pledged by December. He added that it would be impossible for Mr Thaksin to receive a fair trial while the junta was still in control and urged that the case be postponed until next year, or until at least a month after the elections. &quot;I have talked with my two clients and we agree that the best timing for them to return to fight the case is after the election,&quot; Mr Pichit said after the ruling. &quot;We reiterate that the current situation is still not good for their safety and we have no desire to see disunity in the country.&quot; In his initial reaction to the Thai court&apos;s decision, Mr Thaksin gave a non-committal response to the Associated Press. &quot;I am aware of the decision in Thailand,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;I shall consult with my legal advisers and make an announcement in due course.&quot; The army chief, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who led the coup, said Mr Thaksin&apos;s safety would be guaranteed if he returned, directly contradicting an earlier statement that the former premier might be at risk from his enemies. &quot;The [National Security Council] has to be responsible and the government has to ask the police to take care of it with the military playing a supporting role,&quot; he said. &quot;There should not be any problem for him to return. Everything has gone in accordance with the Assets Examination Committee and court process.&quot; Since June, almost \u00a31bn of Mr Thaksin&apos;s assets have been frozen in Thai bank accounts. The tycoon was already a wealthy businessman before he secured two terms in office between 2001 and 2006. But the tax-free sale of his telecoms empire to the Singapore government&apos;s investment arm in 2006 sparked mass street protests that led to his eventual downfall. The Thai military, which justified its takeover on the grounds that Mr Thaksin was corrupt, vilified the former prime minister, but took almost eight months to bring the first charges against him. Backstory Football-mad Thaksin Shinawatra became the first prime minister in Thai history to win two terms of office. The ex-policeman, born in the northern city of Chiang Mai, studied in the US and holds a PhD in criminal justice. On his return in the 1980s, he set up a telecom business and carved out a huge empire, helped by cornering state monopolies. He burst on to the political stage in 1998, using his millions to form the Thai Rak Thai party and in three years he was prime minister, championing Thailand&apos;s rural poor, who still revere him. Before purchasing Manchester City, he failed to win control of Liverpool FC while still prime minister after it emerged that he planned to use state funds to bankroll the deal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/16/viewpointcolumn", "sentences": ["That route has been trodden by Temasek, the state-owned Singapore investment house, and it is profitable: Temasek has generated compound returns of 18% a year for 30 years."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-16T22:42:21Z", "title": "Viewpoint: Bank on the banks - but not just yet", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Banks are always the first shares to be sold in a market obsessed by credit squeezes and bad loans. It&apos;s such a simple call: banks&apos; funding costs are rising and nobody can be sure where the next embarrassing loss will appear. HSBC was caught with too many junk mortgages in the US; if it can happen at one of the world&apos;s most conservative financial institutions, it can happen anywhere. Bank shares have been hammered in the past three weeks. The Chinese state-owned bank, which is investing \u00a33bn in Barclays at 720p, could have bought the same paper at 620p yesterday. Northern Rock, as a mortgage lender with a comparatively tiny deposit base, was down as much as 9% yesterday on fears that it is about to issue another profits warning. That won&apos;t happen soon unless Northern Rock is seriously misleading the market; reassuring noises were heard from the north-east. We might make similar comments about others; the mood music from Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland has been calm. Over at HBOS, the chairman Lord Stevenson dipped into his back pocket for \u00a3500,000 to buy a few shares in the bank. Admittedly, it was a fortnight ago and the sub-prime story has moved on since, but the purchase still looks like a plain statement of internal confidence. Has the selling been overdone? Banks, after the boom years, are well capitalised; many are diversified, and the mortgage banks have security over their loans in the form of bricks and mortar that is not (at least for now) falling in value. Yet the dividend yields on most big banks&apos; shares are now more than 5%, and a juicy 6% in the case of Lloyds TSB. Should you stick one in your ISA and sit back? Maybe not yet. It&apos;s a question of visibility. Goldman Sachs reminded us yesterday that the market was over-stating the earnings power of European banks by a full 20% at the time of the downturn of 2001. If that turns out to be the case this time, some of the current knock-down share prices won&apos;t be the bargains they appear now. There is another reason for waiting. It is almost impossible to imagine banks&apos; share prices rising in the face of a falling stock market. At the moment, fear is everywhere: the latest report from the US house builders showed sentiment at its lowest level since 1991. Some reports suggest it is hard, even for creditworthy borrowers, to get a mortgage in the US. That does not sound like the right climate to be buying financial stocks. But the sector is certainly where long-term opportunities lie. It would require a breathtaking downturn to damage the big banks&apos; capital structures. It&apos;s a matter of striking when prices become absurdly cheap, and we&apos;re not there yet. Qatari puzzle It&apos;s a useful rule: the longer negotiations take, the smaller the chance of them achieving anything. Sainsbury&apos;s looks like a case in point: the Qatari-backed Delta Two vehicle is whistling that its takeover talks, now one month old, are &quot;ongoing&quot;. But going where? The credit crunch hasn&apos;t helped, but the Qataris did themselves no favours by arriving with a me-too private equity proposal. The leverage is immense, and the board is, quite rightly, sniffy: chairman Sir Philip Hampton would look dumb if he recommended an offer that failed to satisfy other powerful parties. The Office of Fair Trading wouldn&apos;t like a deal that loads Sainsbury&apos;s with so much debt that the company couldn&apos;t give Tesco a fair fight. The pension fund would want a big up-front payment, perhaps as much as \u00a31bn. The Sainsbury family, whose leading members are rich enough to have cares beyond their next buck, want to know that the business that bears the family name would be in the hands of responsible owners. That&apos;s why the Qatari approach to these talks is so baffling. Sainsbury is a business that inflames emotions in a way that ICI never did. Customers, staff and outsiders are interested in the identity and ambitions of any new owner. The Qataris have made no attempt to explain what they are about, other than to make bland statements about wishing to spend their oil wealth on other assets. That&apos;s understandable, but why dress in the clothes of a leveraged buy-out outfit and provoke so much hostility? The smarter way to diversify would be to build minority stakes in undervalued companies and be a supportive long-term investor. That route has been trodden by Temasek, the state-owned Singapore investment house, and it is profitable: Temasek has generated compound returns of 18% a year for 30 years. Maybe the penny is dropping in Qatar. As stock markets fall, they are revealing opportunities aplenty for cash-rich investors willing to commit for the long-term. Any number must look better than buying Sainsbury&apos;s at a top-of-the-market price as consumer spending slows.  nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/17/1", "sentences": ["Toulouse-based Airbus said yesterday that the plane, whose wings are made in the UK, will be delivered to Singapore Airlines on October 15.", "The first flight, from Singapore to Sydney, will be 10 days later.", "Singapore Airlines announced last month that seats on the first flight of the double-decker plane would be auctioned on eBay, with the proceeds going to three charities."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-17T00:39:46Z", "title": "Business news in brief", "tags": ["Business", "Flu"], "article": "Dell pares past profits because of &apos;massaging&apos; The computer maker Dell is knocking between $50m (\u00a325m)and $150m off its previously reported profits after discovering that staff were massaging figures to meet financial targets.

Already, South Korea and Israel are deploying armed robot border guards and China, Singapore and the UK are among those making increasing use of military robots. The biggest player yet is the US: robots are integral to its $230bn future combat systems project, a massive plan to develop unmanned vehicles that can strike from the air, under the sea and on land. Congress has set a goal of having one-third of ground combat vehicles unmanned by 2015. Over 4,000 robots are serving in Iraq at present, others in Afghanistan. And now they are armed. Most robots currently in combat are extensions of human fighters who control the application of lethal force. When a semi-autonomous MQ-1 Predator self-navigated above a car full of al-Qaida suspects in 2002, the decision to vaporise them with Hellfire missiles was made by pilots 7,000 miles away. Predators and the more deadly Reaper robot attack planes have flown many missions since then with inevitable civilian deaths, yet working with remote-controlled or semi-autonomous machines carries only the same ethical responsibilities as a traditional air strike. But fully autonomous robots that make their own decisions about lethality are high on the US military agenda. The US National Research Council advises &quot;aggressively exploiting the considerable warfighting benefits offered by autonomous vehicles&quot;. They are cheap to manufacture, require less personnel and, according to the navy, perform better in complex missions. One battlefield soldier could start a large-scale robot attack in the air and on the ground. This is dangerous new territory for warfare, yet there are no new ethical codes or guidelines in place. I have worked in artificial intelligence for decades, and the idea of a robot making decisions about human termination is terrifying. Policymakers seem to have an understanding of AI that lies in the realms of science fiction and myth. A recent US navy document suggests that the critical issue is for autonomous systems to be able to identify the legality of targets. Then their answer to the ethical problems is simply, &quot;Let men target men&quot; and &quot;Let machines target other machines&quot;. In reality, a robot could not pinpoint a weapon without pinpointing the person using it or even discriminate between weapons and non-weapons. I can imagine a little girl being zapped because she points her ice cream at a robot to share. Or a robot could be tricked into killing innocent civilians. In attempting to allay political opposition, the US army is funding a project to equip robot soldiers with a conscience to give them the ability to make ethical decisions. But machines could not discriminate reliably between buses carrying enemy soldiers or schoolchildren, let alone be ethical. It smells like a move to delegate the responsibility for fatal errors on to non-sentient weapons. Human soldiers have legal protocols such as the Geneva conventions to guide them. Autonomous robots are only covered by the laws of armed conflict that deal with standard weapons. But autonomous robots are not like other weapons. We are going to give decisions on human fatality to machines that are not bright enough to be called stupid. With prices falling and technology becoming easier, we may soon see a robot arms race that will be difficult to stop. It is imperative that we create international legislation and a code of ethics for autonomous robots at war before it is too late. \u00b7 Noel Sharkey is professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield noel@dcs.shef.ac.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/19/athletics.news2", "sentences": ["How highly Coe is thought of within the IOC cannot be overestimated after the way he defied Margaret Thatcher&apos;s calls to boycott the 1980 Moscow Games over the Soviet Union&apos;s invasion of Afghanistan, his gold-medal winning performances and the manner in which he so skilfully led London&apos;s bid to host the 2012 Games, culminating in his speech at the vote in Singapore two years ago that snatched victory."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-19T22:48:24Z", "title": "Athletics: Step up in distance for Coe's ambition", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"], "article": "The most far-reaching victory for British athletics during the World Championships that begin on Saturday is not likely to take place on the track (not that there is set to be too many, anyway) but in a lavishly decorated committee room in a five-star hotel in the centre of Osaka. That is where Sebastian Coe will be seeking election as a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body. If he is successful, it could take him a significant step closer to fulfilling his ambition of becoming the most important man in sport. The two-time Olympic 1500 metres champion is one of eight candidates chasing four places at the IAAF&apos;s congress. The election has taken on extra significance because Lamine Diack has indicated he will step down as president of the IAAF at the end of his next four-year term and whoever replaces the Senegalese is certain to come from among those chosen as vice-presidents on this occasion. Insiders believe that the only two credible candidates to replace Diack and be the sport&apos;s figurehead when the IAAF celebrates its centenary in 2012 would be Coe or Sergey Bubka, Ukraine&apos;s legendary pole vaulter who now harbours fierce ambitions in the world of sports politics. For Coe, who resisted overtures from several countries, including India, to stand against Diack in this election, the most difficult thing could be the timing of the next vote. It is due to be held a year before London stages the Olympics and Coe might need convincing that it would be possible to juggle positions as chairman of the local organising committee and president of the world&apos;s biggest sport (the IAAF has 212 members, Fifa 208), even if only for 12 months. Coe will not want to compromise preparations for London by spreading himself too thinly, but will also be acutely aware of what a golden opportunity it would be. His fear is that if he does not stand in four years&apos; time he could be missing out on his best chance of setting in motion a train of events that could one day see him become president of the International Olympic Committee. Becoming president of the IAAF would almost certainly carry with it the important bonus of automatic membership of the IOC and, if Coe were to join this most exclusive of clubs having also organised a successful Games in 2012, then the momentum for him to lead the whole Olympic movement could become as unstoppable as one of his final sprints that carried him to so many titles and world records. How highly Coe is thought of within the IOC cannot be overestimated after the way he defied Margaret Thatcher&apos;s calls to boycott the 1980 Moscow Games over the Soviet Union&apos;s invasion of Afghanistan, his gold-medal winning performances and the manner in which he so skilfully led London&apos;s bid to host the 2012 Games, culminating in his speech at the vote in Singapore two years ago that snatched victory. He has plenty of influential supporters within the movement, most notably Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who, despite being anglophobic, voted for London to host the 2012 Games and last year appointed Coe to lead his organisation&apos;s ethics committee. It could take the persuasive powers of Blatter to convince his British friend to stand in 2011, but if he does few would doubt the chances of serial winner Coe pulling off another famous victory."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/19/4", "sentences": ["Barclays bank volunteered to give Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings a seat on its board to boost its bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro, it has emerged.", "Temasek, the investment arm of the government of Singapore, recently took a 2.1 per cent stake in Barclays alongside state-owned China Development Bank, which bought around 9 per cent.", "It is understood that Temasek, led by Ho Ching, the wife of Singapore&apos;s Prime Minister, did not ask for a board seat but was offered one by Barclays boss John Varley."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-19T22:51:30Z", "title": "Barclays made board offer to Temasek", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Barclays bank volunteered to give Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings a seat on its board to boost its bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro, it has emerged.

This occurred because, in October 1945, Tom landed in what was then the Netherlands East Indies with his RAF unit. Its nominal objective was to help bring back prisoners of war and internees, though Tom thought the real purpose was to hold the ring until the Dutch could re-establish their regime. Two days after the Japanese surrender, the colony&apos;s independence had been declared under Sukarno. Tom and his friends wanted no part in working with the Dutch. So, with the complicity of their adjutant, they set up a pro-Indonesian group within the RAF. Rations were traded for typewriters and a duplicator, which produced the Indonesian Information bulletin. This, in turn, was sent out in handwritten envelopes and flown to Singapore by sympathetic aircrew. One item concerned still detained Indonesians who had worked as slave labour on Japan&apos;s Burma-Thailand railway. The Labour MP Harold Davies read the story and raised the issue in the Commons; the result was the men&apos;s repatriation. Back in London in 1946, Tom used his savings to continue publishing Indonesian Information. Then a former RAF friend from the Netherlands East Indies days, Peter Humphries, turned up with \u00a380 from the Indonesian government department of information. When this ran out, the Indonesian representative in Europe, Dr Subandrio (obituary September 10 2004), stepped in. When I arrived in London in 1950, I found all three - ambassador Subandrio, information officer Atkinson and administrative officer Humphries - ensconced in the impressive Grosvenor Square embassy. Two years later, Tom was recalled to Jakarta to serve as Sukarno&apos;s speechwriter; one of his speeches, delivered to the UN general assembly, got a standing ovation. Initially, Sukarno was satisfied to be a spokesman for the non-aligned bloc of states, but the two men were drifting apart by the late 1950s. By the early 1960s, Sukarno was attacking &quot;British imperialism&quot;. Sukarno listened less and less to his speechwriter&apos;s warnings that he was overreaching himself. Indeed, Tom resisted attending one international conference in 1961, claiming he had &quot;nothing to contribute&quot;. Overwork brought on one collapse that year - he was repatriated but recalled - and another in 1962, when he returned to Britain for good, along with his wife Rene, who had been working in the information ministry. In 1965 Indonesia&apos;s botched leftwing coup was followed by a bloody counter-coup led by the rightwing General Suharto. The Atkinsons witnessed the horrors from afar as the killings of hundreds of thousands of people ensued. In 1968, an enfeebled Sukarno was replaced by Suharto. Despite a cut-glass accent, Tom was a policeman&apos;s son from Cockfield, a Durham mining village. By his early teens, he was a Young Communist; in 1936, aged 14, he left school and made his way to Spain to enlist in the international brigade. Told to &quot;go home to your mother&quot;, he worked as a grocer&apos;s assistant Then, in 1941, he joined the RAF, volunteering for the servicing commandos, whose job was setting up airfields behind the frontline. In December 1944, his unit, SC3210, together with 4,000 other men and 200 WAAFs, sailed on a Dutch transport from Liverpool, where he met his future wife and lifelong love. With the Japanese surrender in August 1945, his unit was deployed in the retaking of Malaya. After 1962, the Atkinsons ran a northwest Scotland hotel, spent 10 years on a small west Wales farm and returned to Scotland to found the Luath Press, which published Tom&apos;s many guides to his beloved west and north of Scotland. He also wrote Napier&apos;s History of Herbal Healing: Ancient and Modern (2004) - partly in solidarity with his herbalist daughters - and edited Spectacles, Testicles, Fags and Matches, memoirs of the servicing commandos. Out of the blue in 1995, Tom and Rene were invited to the 50th anniversary celebrations of Indonesian independence. After some soul-searching, they accepted; they were dismayed by the militarism but delighted to see old friends. Last year, a stroke impaired his vision but did not deter him from starting his autobiography. He is survived by Rene and his daughters, Dee and Chanchal. \u00b7 Thomas Wilfred Atkinson, writer and publisher, born August 30 1922; died June 26 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/22/gender.uk", "sentences": ["Festivals have taken place in Berlin, Toulouse, Hawaii, Brisbane, Singapore and Malmo, and 2007 has already seen UK Ladyfests in Cambridge and Leeds, with Ladyfest Bristol running next week from August 27 to September 2."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-22T01:07:22Z", "title": "Leonie Cooper on DIY feminist festivals", "tags": ["Gender", "World news", "UK news", "Women", "Life and style", "Feminism"], "article": "Over the years, music and cultural festivals have tended to be a man&apos;s game. Even the achingly liberal Latitude festival, held in Suffolk in July, for instance, was packed with male headliners - the Arcade Fire being the only one to have any female members at all. Over the past seven years, though, a vibrant underground force has been bucking against this male domination. It started in 2000, in Olympia, Washington, when the riot-grrrl bands, Sleater-Kinney and Bratmobile, staged the first ever Ladyfest - a non-profit DIY feminist festival, run by volunteers. Along with music, there were workshops, art installations and discussion groups.  Which could have been the end of it. Somehow, though, that first festival proved such a potent spark that Ladyfests have been proliferating ever since - in 2001 there were five of them worldwide, and by 2005 (the last year for which there are complete figures) this had grown to 31. Festivals have taken place in Berlin, Toulouse, Hawaii, Brisbane, Singapore and Malmo, and 2007 has already seen UK Ladyfests in Cambridge and Leeds, with Ladyfest Bristol running next week from August 27 to September 2. Leicester will host one in October, and a Ladyfest London is scheduled for May 2008. There is no central Ladyfest headquarters, and each festival is autonomous - anyone can put one on and run it according to their own rules and ideals. It is a given that thou shalt not take the Ladyfest name in vain, though. All the festivals are collaborative efforts run by large groups, so someone will undoubtedly find out if you sneakily try to run one for profit. Apart from that, it&apos;s all up to you. Here, with help from the Ladyfest Bristol organisers, and others, is a complete cut-out-and-keep guide to how to go about it.  Getting started Unless you are an organisational superwoman - spandex pants optional - you will need to find a group of like-minded individuals before you start; Ladyfest is all about teamwork. Bristol&apos;s forthcoming event has been organised by a core committee of four women volunteers in their early to mid 20s, a group of music-loving friends who have DJed and promoted gigs together in the past. Hannah Wright is managing the project, Elizabeth Payne is doing PR, Sian Norris is art coordinator and Jess Tye is in charge of fundraising. None of them has been involved in a Ladyfest before, but after attending Ladyfest Bristol in 2003 (&quot;a brilliant event,&quot; sighs Norris), they came away inspired. And some of the 2003 organisers have been giving them a helping hand. They are also working with a large group of first-time Ladyfest volunteers who responded to their local adverts. &quot;We were all very aware of what a positive effect the last Ladyfest had on the local area,&quot; says Payne, &quot;and how good a platform it had been for local and national performers; it&apos;s great for us, four years later, to carry on providing a platform for these artists, musicians, cabaret artists and people who are doing theatre, especially now that Bristol seems to be really blossoming.&quot; As all Ladyfests are non-profit, at an early stage you will also need to pick a women&apos;s charity to donate funds to - Ladyfest Bristol is donating to the Fawcett Society, the UK&apos;s leading campaign for gender equality.  Booking acts Once you have decided to put on a Ladyfest, put the feelers out on internet message boards to see if people are interested in attending, and what they would like to see. If you are lucky, this initial online activity will also attract performers who are aching to play at your event. Leeds-based Penny Broadhurst, a musician, spoken-word artist and comedian, performed at her first Ladyfest in Birmingham in 2004 after reading about it on a mailing list for performers. She sent off her CD to the organisers and was invited to play. She enjoyed it so much that she took a role in organising this year&apos;s Ladyfest Leeds. &quot;I curated and compered a comedy night,&quot; she says, &quot;wrote a zine about DIY comedy, did my own hour-long show and was a steward for much of the festival.&quot; No matter how much initial interest you generate, though, you will still have to hunt down a fair number of acts. Social networking site MySpace is a great place to look for bands, comedians and even artists. Simply send a message to anyone who takes your fancy, tell them what you are after and see if they bite. The general rule is that acts should be mostly female or female-fronted, but these festivals are truly DIY, so it is entirely up to you. Broadhurst suggests that, when looking for artists, it is best to start locally. &quot;We tried to prioritise local performers, as did Newcastle&apos;s event, with the aim of having half the acts coming from the area.&quot; This also ensures that each Ladyfest has a unique feel, and cuts down on travel costs and carbon emissions. However, London-based electro-poppers and fancy-dress enthusiasts, the Duloks, have played four UK Ladyfests and in each instance were approached via MySpace. The band epitomise Ladyfest&apos;s DIY ethic: &quot;Duloks are built on girl power,&quot; says lead singer Mira Manga. &quot;We do everything ourselves: booking shows, T-shirts, management - so we are 100% lady-driven.&quot; Advertising &amp; fundraising As well as booking bands via MySpace you can also use the site to generate some free publicity. Over the past few years, almost every Ladyfest has had a presence on the social networking site. &quot;It has been a really useful tool for us,&quot; says Ladyfest Bristol&apos;s Jess Tye, who used the site to book performers for the event&apos;s initial fundraising events. &quot;Hannah set up the MySpace last year to gauge interest in the event,&quot; continues Tye, &quot;and she got a lot of positive responses. It was a really important factor in convincing us to go ahead with the festival.&quot; Julia Downes, who was on the music committee for Ladyfest Leeds earlier this year, used MySpace for advertising too, but also suggests placing hand-designed flyers and posters in local libraries, cafes and other venues with a sympathetic clientele. Your Ladyfest will be nigh on impossible to run if you don&apos;t have enough dosh. In Bristol, an &quot;unplugged&quot; gig featuring local female performers raised over \u00a3300, while a cake sale and clothes-customising party garnered \u00a380. &quot;It was really fun and I got loads of new clothes,&quot; says organiser Sian Norris. The Ladyfest team also organised a pop-culture pub quiz. &quot;The pub was packed out and we raised another \u00a380,&quot; says Norris. A number of bands performing at Bristol have also pledged to donate a percentage of the money raised from the sales of CDs at their gigs to charity. But Elizabeth Payne is still worried about the financial aspect. &quot;So many people and venues have given their time and space for free but we&apos;re still not sure whether we&apos;ll cover our costs.&quot; While most budding acts will usually perform for free in exchange for some good exposure, venues that run as profit-making businesses can be difficult. At which point the phrase &quot;ain&apos;t too proud to beg&quot; takes on a whole new relevance ...  Workshops The original Ladyfest in Washington held workshops on subjects including organic gardening, swing dancing, making your own menstrual products and car repair. The workshops are where Ladyfests really come into their own, ensuring that the events educate as well as entertain. Ladyfests in the past have had strong links with Stitch&apos;n Bitch - the brainchild of Debbie Stoller, editor-in-chief of American feminist magazine Bust - a movement that has seen women across the world reclaim knitting as a feminist activity. Most cities in the UK have their own Stitch&apos;n Bitch group, so get in touch with them and ask if they would fancy holding a session - one is being held at Ladyfest Bristol if you are keen to purl in public. Other forms of crafting also make popular workshops - Bristol will be having a &quot;make your own bunting&quot; workshop. If crocheting your own tampons seems a little far-fetched, then you can always tailor your festival towards discussions, rather than crafts. If you want to focus on that aspect, local universities are an excellent place to bag speakers - hunt around and see if there are any likely-looking academics who wouldn&apos;t mind lending their expertise to a discussion. Ladyfest workshops are often proof that the festival has a sense of humour as well. Penny Broadhurst of Ladyfest Leeds notes that &quot;DIY dildo-making was clearly the craziest, and best, workshop&quot;.  Smoothing over the cracks  Despite your best efforts, it is a given that things won&apos;t run half as smoothly as you would like. When organising Ladyfest Leeds, Broadhurst ran into arguments with people who thought that male organisers shouldn&apos;t be allowed, that men couldn&apos;t be feminists, or even show solidarity. A number of women also tried to block discussions on pornography. &quot;Groups were trying to stamp their idea of what a feminist is on to our festival,&quot; says Broadhurst. &quot;There isn&apos;t just one kind of feminist, and many of us disagree.&quot; While setting up the forthcoming Ladyfest Bristol, Elizabeth Payne&apos;s problems have revolved around dealing with the sheer number of people involved. &quot;Working in such a huge group is difficult - there are over 70 volunteers, so it takes a long time to come to a decision. We want everyone to agree on everything, but it&apos;s really hard to get everyone&apos;s voice heard when you have a deadline to meet.&quot;  Enjoying it If all goes well, your Ladyfest won&apos;t just be an enjoyable experience for the punters, but for the performers and organisers as well. &quot;It&apos;s very warm and welcoming,&quot; says Mira Manga. &quot;You&apos;re basically guaranteed an audience who are enthused about what you&apos;re doing before you hit the stage, and that&apos;s pretty rare.&quot; There is also a good chance that the audience will experience something they will never forget. Julia Downes has attended seven Ladyfests, including the first ever UK event in Glasgow, in 2001, where she saw the Gossip play live. &quot;Beth Ditto was on fire and stripped naked,&quot; says Downes. &quot;It re-energised people and made this abstract, dated American thing called riot grrrl - which some of us had missed out on - a very real presence in our lives.&quot; Meanwhile, back in Bristol, a band called Blue Tobias have formed specifically to play the city&apos;s bash. &quot;It&apos;s a testament to how Ladyfest can inspire people,&quot; says Payne. &quot;It&apos;ll be their first ever gig - I&apos;m not saying they&apos;ll be brilliant, but it&apos;s great that they&apos;ve been inspired to give it a go.&quot; Ladyfest Bristol is also running a Mad Hatter&apos;s Tea Party, a fancy-dress shindig that will be open to children and grown-ups alike. &quot;I think I&apos;m going to be a caterpillar,&quot; says Wright. Payne is most looking forward to seeing Anat Ben-David from German art-dance act Chicks on Speed perform. &quot;She&apos;s kicking off the week, and I&apos;m really excited about the whole launch,&quot; she says, &quot;because it&apos;ll mean that the festival is actually happening and we haven&apos;t just imagined it all!&quot;  Further details: ladyfestbristol.org.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/24/marketforces1", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s DBS Group Holdings also revealed bigger-than-expected exposure to the US home loan market, as did Bank of China&apos;s subsidiary BOC Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-24T13:56:40Z", "title": "US data soothes market nerves", "tags": ["Business"], "article": " The FTSE 100 managed to keep its week-long run in positive territory, and after starting the day in a hesitant mood, it finally closed up 23.2 points at 6220.1.   Positive data from the US helped lift the index of 100 leading shares, despite an initial period of gloom in the morning sparked by news that three Asian banks were exposed to the troubled US mortgage market. Bank of China, one of the country&apos;s biggest state-owned banks announced it held nearly $10bn of securities backed by US sub-prime mortgages.   Singapore&apos;s DBS Group Holdings also revealed bigger-than-expected exposure to the US home loan market, as did Bank of China&apos;s subsidiary BOC Hong Kong.   Despite this, and owing to good data from the US, the FTSE 100 ended up in positive territory for the sixth day in a row.   A US durable goods report showed that orders rose 5.9% in July - the most in 10 months - against a 1% consensus estimate, while June&apos;s growth rate was revised up to 1.9% from 1.4%.   Separately, new home sales in the US rose in July - an unexpected piece of good news that helped counter some of the recent negative sentiment.   Wolseley, the company that distributes plumbing and heating products, was positively affected by the latter piece of data and was one of the top risers on the FTSE 100. The company has a lot of exposure to the US - a fact that has raised concern during the recent market turmoil. But it helped the firm today, and shares rose 27p to \u00a310.50.   It was a mixed picture for the miners today. Kazakhmys, for example, was down 5p to \u00a312.49. But BHP Billiton, the world&apos;s largest miner, rose 20p to \u00a313.75 as metal prices reversed earlier losses on the back of the US data. Rio Tinto increased 77p to \u00a333.39 - also one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100.   National Grid, meanwhile, rose 13p to 730p as it announced that its acquisition of KeySpan would finally be completed today - 18 months after announcing it would buy the US company. Steve Holliday, chief executive of National Grid, said: &quot;We&apos;ve been working towards this goal for well over a year and I am absolutely delighted that we have achieved the final milestone.&quot;   Property firms were in demand today after analysts at Lehman Brothers upgraded some of the companies. British Land, for example, was up 19p at \u00a312.77 after it was upgraded to overweight.   But the banking sector was hit hard, and none more so than Standard Chartered Bank, which is heavily exposed to Asia. The company saw its shares fall 77p to \u00a314.94.   It also had to move to quash rumours that Whistlejacket Capital, a structured investment vehicle it sponsors, was in trouble and may have to be propped up by the bank.   But Standard Chartered said Whistlejacket was triple-A rated, adding its direct exposure to the vehicle was limited to its $250m investment in the fund.   Other banks dropped following general negative sentiment in the sector. Alliance &amp; Leicester was down 12p to \u00a310.49, and Northern Rock, which is more reliant on money markets than its rivals, fell 17.5p to 739.5p.   Barclays followed the trend, down 16.5p to 611p, also dragged down by speculation that Royal Bank of Scotland, which is in the bidding race for Dutch bank ABN Amro, might lower its bid for the latter. This would make it more likely that Barclays succeed in the acquisition, which shareholders are not happy about.   News that the head of a key division exposed to US sub-prime loans at the bank had resigned did little to help. Edward Cahill, who led the European collateralised debt obligations division, is understood to have quit on Monday.   3i, the private equity firm, saw its shares fall 46p to \u00a310.34. Maan Abdulwahed Al-Sanea, the Saudi billionaire, had bought a 5% stake in Quoted Private Equity, a 3i unit that buys small and mid-cap companies in the UK and continental Europe. Mr Al-Sanea bought 20m shares on July 2, when Quoted Private Equity shares closed at 98.5p. This values his stake at around \u00a319.7m.   Rentokil Initial, meanwhile, was still down 3.5p at 167.8p after yesterday&apos;s first-half results. The pest control group posted a drop in first-half profits, as expected, and shares fell despite the fact the company gave a surprise bullish assessment for 2008. Analysts at Citigroup today kept their sell recommendation, despite raising their price target to 150p from 145p.   British Airways fell 10.2p to 409.25p on news it was fined $300m in the US for price fixing, and that senior staff at the company under criminal investigation for price fixing could be extradited to the US.   Finally, on Aim, Sibir Energy, the Russian oil and gas company and the biggest firm on the junior market, saw its shares soar 43p to 525p as it announced the acquisition of Moscow&apos;s oil refining and petrol retail assets for $922m. The deal now makes the company a fully integrated player in the sector.   A spokesperson for the City of Moscow said: &quot;The transaction is in full accord with the country&apos;s policy of consolidation in the area of natural resources and is the first step towards the creation of another large, vertically integrated oil company with the participation of state oil companies.&quot; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/25/theatre", "sentences": ["Aurora Nova has had a hit with The Table, a wooden instrument with exceptional acoustic properties, and now Scotland&apos;s Theatre Cryptic joins Singapore&apos;s T&apos;ang Quartet to create music that is to be seen as much as heard."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-24T23:29:17Z", "title": "Theatre preview: Aug 25 - 31", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "Awake And Sing!

Bigger on character and socialist rhetoric than plot, it depicts their economic hardships, hopes and fears (prefiguring Arnold Wesker&apos;s trilogy of Jewish family life).

The ultimate, cross-dressing mistaken identity farce, this most melancholy comedy would, of course, have originally been acted by boys pretending to be women disguised as boys. Confused? Well, Viola certainly is and, in this instance, she will be played by a male actor, Chris New, who was recently Horst alongside Alan Cumming in Bent. American actor John Lithgow is Malvolio and Siobhan Redmond should be a sparky Maria. Lyn Gardner  \u00b7  Courtyard Theatre, Thu 30 to Oct 6 Traces Edinburgh Circus performance has moved on a long way in recent years, with the most interesting companies negotiating a path that is as far from the old-fashioned big top as it is from Cirque Du Soleil. One of them is The Seven Fingers, a young French-Canadian troupe who are so breathtaking you genuinely could watch them jump through hoops all day. The way the show is packaged makes it interesting, as it plays out its feats against the endlessly ticking clock and a wistful sense that we all only have a few years on earth before being blown away by the sands of time. But that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s heavy; this young company&apos;s skills are so superlative you almost feel they can fly.

Nick Darke&apos;s version should be as warm and satisfying as toast and honey as it recounts all the novel&apos;s great incidents, from the first day at school to Lee&apos;s encounter with local siren, Rosie, under the hay wagon one hot summer&apos;s day. A journey from innocence to manhood peopled with a host of warring and eccentric relatives, Theresa Heskins&apos; production should recall a world long since vanished. LG  \u00b7  New Vic, Fri 31 to Sep 22 Orpheus X Edinburgh This year&apos;s Edinburgh International Festival programme has placed a particular emphasis on the importance of mythology and the way that different versions of the same story pop up across centuries and across cultures. So it&apos;s fitting that the theatre programme should head towards its conclusion with the American Repertory Theatre&apos;s contemporary take on Orpheus, which casts the lyre-playing poet as a modern rock god. With music and text by Rinde Eckert, this imagines Orpheus shut up in his recording studio after being involved in a fatal car crash which killed Eurydice. The only way he can save her is by taking a journey to Hades and back. But will she want to return to the world above? LG  \u00b7  Royal Lyceum Theatre, Sat 25 to Aug 29 The Burial At Thebes Nottingham &quot;Why do it again?&quot; was poet Seamus Heaney&apos;s response when Dublin&apos;s Abbey Theatre first approached him to write a new version of Sophocles&apos; Antigone, the story about the Theban princess who defies her Uncle Creon and buries the body of her brother, Polyneices, declared a traitor to the city. Then George Bush started rattling his sabre and, as the Iraq war loomed, Nobel prize-winner Heaney knew it was game on. The result is the gravely beautiful and exquisitely simple The Burial At Thebes, which draws on the rhythm of Irish laments to retell an age old story with a contemporary twist. Lucy Pitman-Wallace&apos;s UK premiere was a huge success at the Playhouse in 2005 and now it is back for two weeks to be followed by a tour to London and Oxford. LG  \u00b7  Nottingham Playhouse, Fri 31 to Sep 15 Optical Identity Edinburgh Musical furniture seems all the rage this festival. Aurora Nova has had a hit with The Table, a wooden instrument with exceptional acoustic properties, and now Scotland&apos;s Theatre Cryptic joins Singapore&apos;s T&apos;ang Quartet to create music that is to be seen as much as heard. With sculptural sets by famed furniture designer Jason Ong, Optical Indentity is an experiment which combines interactive technologies and visuals with established chamber pieces and new music - including the European premiere of a new piece from Joby Talbot, who has worked with the Divine Comedy and the White Stripes. Director Cathie Boyd has been at the forefront in developments in music theatre over the last decade, so this should be a stimulating and challenging evening. LG \u00b7  Royal Lyceum Theatre, Fri 31 to Sep 1 All About My Mother London Something of a coup for Kevin Spacey&apos;s Old Vic in capturing the world premiere of a play based on a Pedro Almod\u00f3var movie. It&apos;s the first time that the colourful Spanish director has allowed his work to be performed in English in the theatre, and almost 20 years since any stage adaptation of his work. All About My Mother was his 1999 film, which won an Oscar as best foreign language film and has now been adapted by Samuel Adamson. After the sudden death of her son on his 17th birthday, Manuela (played by Lesley Manville, best known for her work with director Mike Leigh) goes in search of the father he never knew, now a transvestite. She encounters another tranny, a young pregnant nun who is looking for love, and Huma Rojo (Diana Rigg), the actress her son adored. Tom Cairns directs this quintessential Almod\u00f3var, an absorbing yarn with great parts for women.

Meal for two, including wine, from \u00a3150 From the moment we walk through the front door of the Dorchester hotel we accept that we are in a different world. The opulence, as we walk - saunter, possibly - through the central comfort zone of the extensive, ground-floor salon, so generously furnished with high-backed sofas and the widest armchairs you have ever seen, appears suddenly quite absurd. It also seems that those who are occupying these overplumped suites are, themselves, a touch unreal. However, even if one is a very rich visitor indeed, casually familiar with unfeasible flower arrangements and that which feels, underfoot, like a full three inches of the very finest Aubusson, it would take an extraordinary arrogance not to be somewhat impressed. At the very end of the room we turn left and descend into yet another unworldly place, that of Thirties Shanghai perhaps, for lunch at China Tang. Here, all is varnished wood, mirrored pillars, folding screens, fine linen and etched wine glasses. Lighting is spot on, and one sits on deeply comfortable brocade banquettes. Do not miss the gorgeous lavs, either, with their striking geometric floor tiles. And the bar here is one of the nicest in London, as is the highly competent young lady who mixes a pair of fine Martinis. As my friend Jason looks at the menu, I request the wine list. &apos;Perhaps an Alsatian,&apos; I suggest. &apos;And would that be with black beans, or ginger and garlic?&apos; Jason quips. I almost fall off my stool. Not because of his mildly tasteless joke, but from the shock of the prices. For a fleeting moment, having just returned from Paris, I think I am reading in euros. For example, of two Sancerres, one is \u00a380, the other an extraordinary \u00a3130! We don&apos;t have the Alsace in the end, but a very good Italian Chardonnay. For \u00a385. Before arriving at China Tang, I had decided we should eat familiar and favourite Chinese. In this respect, the extensive menu does not disappoint. Enthused, we chose one each of the following: &apos;classic&apos; roast pigeon (\u00a318); sweet and sour pork (\u00a314); &apos;classic&apos; steamed scallops in black bean (\u00a316 - for just the two scallops!); Singapore vermicelli (\u00a310); &apos;classic&apos; congee with pork meatball, liver, kidney and tripe (\u00a38); a 50/50 serving of barbecue cha sui pork and roast duck (\u00a316); finally, the not-so-familiar bean curds with minced chicken and salted fish in a clay pot (\u00a318). Well, let&apos;s just say we were very hungry. From the dim sum menu we chose irresistible Shanghai dumplings (\u00a34). And I&apos;m glad we did. My word, these are good: juicy, deeply flavoured, and the lightest of clinging paste enclosing their goodness. I could have eaten 10. Along with the dumplings, the star dishes are the pork, scallops and bean curd. We marvel at how they had managed the essential crunch of crisp coating to tender pork, in conjunction with its perfectly judged, piquant sauce. The very fresh scallops (that&apos;s just the two, remember), cooked in shell, are deliciously smeared with mulched beans as well as nibbed particles in the almost &apos;brewed&apos; tasting sauce beneath. But it is the bean curd dish that shows the kitchen at its most accomplished. Texture being as important in Chinese food as flavour, it is the contrast between the super-bland curds slipping across the tongue combined with the mildly fetid fish shreds, delicate dice of chicken and sloppy, almost winey sauce which makes every mouthful a savoury ambrosia. An extraordinary dish. On the roast and barbecued front, the pigeon and duck both have a good, rich flavour and supremely tender, almost fondant flesh, but they don&apos;t deliver the expected crispness of skin one so looks forward to. The pork is juicy and correct. Personally, I think the congee a touch over-processed, with the rice cooked until no trace of rice remains, but Jason likes it. Although congee&apos;s blandness is always soothing, the exciting bits were on the pedestrian side, and tough. The dish that truly disappoints, however, is the Singapore vermicelli. Bland, in this particular case, is most unwelcome. We also ask if they have any XO sauce - a deeply flavoured, oily dipping condiment made from pounded dried seafood (roe, particularly), chillies, garlic and soy. Now I know XO has never been cheap to make, or purchase. But to charge \u00a35 for one tablespoon seems a supplement too far. Absurdly, this would constitute one-third of the price of the simple set-lunch menu. It&apos;s a topsy-turvy kind of world in China Tang, but I like it and will return.

Those remarks went down badly among BBC executives who believe the problem lies with the sport itself and point to the many empty seats in Osaka as evidence. Aware of the bad feeling, Warner explained his thinking to the senior commentators Steve Cram, Brendan Foster and Jonathan Edwards, all still influential within the sport. He said that his comments were part of a critique of the sport as a whole and that governing bodies, promoters and broadcasters had to innovate to recapture interest. UKA&apos;s rights deal with the BBC expires at the end of next summer and negotiations will open under something of a cloud. The BBC will be loth to let another broadcaster take over the coverage, however, because it is promoting itself as &quot;the Olympic broadcaster&quot; in its world championships coverage. The problem is that, though popular at the Olympics, track and field audiences are dwindling. The men&apos;s 100m final on Sunday afternoon had only 1.2m viewers, a 13% audience share, despite featuring the first meeting this year between Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay. The figures may justify the BBC&apos;s decision to cut costs by basing its presenters Sue Barker, Hazel Irvine, Michael Johnson and Colin Jackson in London. Rogge&apos;s focus on youth Ed Warner&apos;s concern at the lack of interest in track and field is mirrored at the International Olympic Committee, where attracting interest among young people has become Jacques Rogge&apos;s priority. The president&apos;s solution is to introduce a Youth Olympics starting in 2010, an event for 14-18-year-olds that he hopes will engage a new generation. There has been considerable interest from potential hosts, who have until Friday to express interest. Singapore, Moscow, Athens, Algiers and Turin are among the bidding cities. Britons in thick of battle The contenders for the 2016 Olympic Games have begun assembling campaign teams for what promises to be the most lavish bidding round since the IOC acted to deter corruption. British lobbyists feature heavily, with Tokyo engaging Jon Tibbs, the communications strategist who was involved in the successful Sydney and Beijing bids and Sochi&apos;s triumph in securing the 2014 Winter Olympics. The free-spending Gulf city Doha has engaged the former London 2012 communications director Mike Lee and the strategist Andrew Craig, another member of London&apos;s team. Chicago have hired the American George Hirthler, who was involved in Atlanta 1996. Madrid and Rio de Janeiro are the other bidding cities. Platini plan kept in hand Europe&apos;s major leagues and clubs will go into a meeting to discuss restructuring the Champions League without a clear indication of Michel Platini&apos;s plans. The Uefa president is determined to reduce the representation of the major nations by handing a place in the qualifying rounds to domestic cup winners but a detailed proposal has not been made available to representatives of the European Professional Leagues or clubs. The issue will be discussed by Uefa&apos;s Professional Football Strategy Council on Thursday. The suspicion among the clubs is that the details are being kept from them in an attempt to force through the changes as a fait accompli. Uefa&apos;s executive committee will take the final decision in September. Spurs sale suspicion rises Last week&apos;s inept display by the Tottenham board has done nothing to ease the impression that the club is being fattened for sale. The chairman Daniel Levy&apos;s company ENIC has increased its stake in the club to 82%, a figure boosted by \u00a367m in share purchases confirmed in a statement to the stock exchange on Friday. The suspicion remains that once the club has settled on stadium expansion plans, either with a redevelopment of White Hart Lane or a move, Levy will consider selling. He will want the prospect of Champions League football to sweeten an exit strategy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/aug/29/art2", "sentences": ["&quot;Theoretically, everyone could just let go and the artwork would disappear,&quot; says Haque, who last coordinated the event in Singapore in 2006, where it attracted 5,000 participants."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-28T23:02:50Z", "title": "The artwork that could disappear", "tags": ["Art", "Culture", "Art and design", "Skyscrapers"], "article": "Fancy being part of an artwork the size of a skyscraper that you control?

The graphic images, which include pictures of diseased lungs, must be printed on all tobacco products made in the UK by the end of 2009, under the new regulations. After public consultation 15 images have been chosen to accompany text warnings about smoking related diseases, including lung cancer and heart disease. The charity Cancer Research UK estimates the images could help an additional 10,000 smokers in England to quit. But smokers&apos; lobby group Forest said they were being &quot;victimised&quot;. The health secretary, Alan Johnson, denied that smokers were being &quot;demonised&quot;. He said the graphic images were necessary because of the diminishing impact of written warnings on tobacco products. Mr Johnson told GMTV: &quot;We&apos;ve had the messages on cigarette packets since 2003, warning that smoking kills, for instance. The evidence is that&apos;s very effective, but it&apos;s diminishing in its effect. &quot;Using graphic images to get the same message across - that smoking kills, that people who smoke will die younger, that smoking actually makes your skin age - these are important messages, and if you can introduce graphics into it as well it has a more dramatic effect.&quot; The chief medical officer for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, added: &quot;This will help promote better awareness of the damage that smoking does to lives and families, an essential step towards reducing the number of people who start smoking.&quot; Cigarette packs that only feature written warnings will not be allowed on sale in the UK after September 30 next year. For other tobacco products the deadline is September 30, 2009. Canada was the first country to put visual warnings on cigarettes in 2000. More than 70% of adults and nearly 90% of youths in Canada believe the images are effective, according to the Department of Health. A poll of Canadian smokers found that more than half said they smoked less around other people as a result of the graphic images. In Singapore, where the graphic images were introduced in 2004, a quarter of smokers felt motivated to quit. Professor Robert West, director of tobacco studies at Cancer Research UK, said one study found that 33% of Canadian smokers said they were more likely to quit as a result of seeing the images. He said that taking into account wishful thinking on the part of smokers wanting to quit, his estimate was that 1 in 1,000 smokers would quit as a result of similar measures in the UK. &quot;That wouldn&apos;t even show as a blip on the official statistics but it equates to around 10,000 people in England alone.

According to Lonely Planet, since Singapore became independent of its northern neighbour Malaysia in the early 1960s, consecutive leaders have tightly observed the social behaviour of the people, regulating it through policies resembling &quot;social engineering dreams&quot;. After two days of conference sessions about the regulation of and social behaviour in virtual worlds, some clear parallels emerged. For example, it quickly became obvious how much information the so-called game gods collect: everything. And while we&apos;d like to think that these spaces are libertarian autocracies, as Professor Richard Bartle, co-developer of the very first virtual world, explained, they are in fact benevolent dictatorships. The gods have the power. A case being heard in the US between Second Life resident Marc Bragg and developers Linden Lab demonstrates this. Bragg, who owned approximately $3,000 (\u00a31,500) worth of virtual land, discovered a loophole in the land auction processes and proceeded to buy thousands more acres at knock-down prices. Linden Lab discovered that he was gaming the system, banned his account and took away all his land. And what happens with all the stuff recorded about players if game and virtual world developers have so much power? When pressed by conference organiser Professor Dan Hunter, There.com CEO Michael Wilson said the company is cognizant of the records it keeps in to watch for any nefarious activity. Linden Lab says it wipes all of its data after eight days. Sony Online, publisher of EverQuest and Star Wars Galaxies, apparently keeps records indefinitely. But what about Microsoft&apos;s Xbox Live? Blizzard&apos;s World of Warcraft? How about Google, which recently filed a patent for a technology that will mine gamers&apos; searches in order to target relevant in-game advertising? Under European law, we have the right to ask what kind of data is being collected about us. But these companies aren&apos;t European, so does our right still remain? These questions go beyond complaining to the game gods about the inflation and deflation of virtual properties. No longer simply the realm of the popular fantastic, our movements in entertainment and social spaces are being observed by the people who at the minute we simply must trust to do right. \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/01/weekend7.weekend2", "sentences": ["In 1941 I was posted to Singapore, and in 1942 sent to Java, to set up a mobile radar station just opposite Krakatoa.", "After that I was moved to Jakarta, then on to Singapore.", "I was on one of the last boats out of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-08-31T23:00:54Z", "title": "Experience: I was a Japanese prisoner of war", "tags": ["Life and style"], "article": "I had begun my working life as an accountant, but I really wanted to be a pilot, and in July 1939, aged 21, I moved to the RAF volunteer reserve. In 1941 I was posted to Singapore, and in 1942 sent to Java, to set up a mobile radar station just opposite Krakatoa. One day we heard tremendous gunfire and decided we&apos;d better get back to Jakarta. On the Sunda Strait coast, we were ambushed by Japanese soldiers. I was shot in the back and hip. Hearing the truck door swinging open, I slumped over the steering wheel, feigning death. Soldiers prodded me to see if I was still alive, then moved on to the vehicle behind. Taking a chance, I leapt out and ran into the paddy fields by the side of the road. Bullets whistled past my ears and I was shot in the arm as the soldiers gave chase. I hid among trees at the edge of the paddy and for four days I lay there, in torrential rain, with animals and insects biting at my wounds, surviving on water dripping from the trees. Finally, close to death, I was found by a Javanese girl who took me to her village. They were marvellous, patching me up and giving me food - until the Japanese authorities declared that anyone harbouring an escaped English prisoner would have their village destroyed. They had no option but to turn me in. At the Japanese headquarters, the Kempetai (secret police) tried to find out what equipment the British had and how many aircraft. I was beaten up, had samurai swords flicked in my face, a pistol held to my head, and then the commandant had the idea that I should dig my own grave. I didn&apos;t know the answers to their questions but, as I stood by that grave, at gunpoint, I decided to make up the numbers. I never gave away anything about the equipment we had, though, and for that I was tied to a tree in the blazing sun for the day, then left there most of the night. After that I was moved to Jakarta, then on to Singapore. Here we were viciously beaten every day on the slightest pretext, and the food went from very little to nearly nothing. There were rumours people were killing stray cats just to stay alive. I feared the worst when I was sent to Kuching to build an airstrip. The indigenous people were the heavily tattooed Dayaks, who&apos;d remove the head of a person just to be eligible to start courting. Thankfully they left us alone. I think they felt sorry for us. Not so the Japanese soldiers, whose sadistic treatment continued. Often drunk on sake, they&apos;d come in the huts in the middle of the night and carry out brutal beatings. But we knew that what they did to us, their officers did to them, and there was nothing we could do: even if we did escape, we looked so unlike the local people we&apos;d have stood out a mile. Women and men were separated by a barbed-wire fence patrolled by guards. When an Australian man found a way to burrow underneath and got a woman pregnant, he was sadistically humiliated and beaten, but all of us knew that secretly the Japanese soldiers saw him as a hero. After that he wanted for nothing. What all of us wanted was food. It was at an all-time low here - three handfuls of rice a day and a watery soup with leaves floating in it. There was horrendous disease in the camp and vast, excruciating ulcers. Prisoners were given three floorboards&apos; living space each - at one point I had a dead body on each side. I&apos;d been talking to the chap next to me one night; when I woke up in the morning he was dead. After three years as a prisoner, it was the atom bomb at Hiroshima that saved my life. The Japanese soldiers had been ordered to retreat into the mountains, killing all but a handful of their prisoners, but after Hiroshima the Japanese emperor sent out orders that they should surrender. Planes flying overhead dropped food parcels - and the news that our ordeal was over. I was on one of the last boats out of Singapore. I felt lucky to be alive, but I found it hard to adjust to civilian life. I was restless, couldn&apos;t settle, and was left with a damaged left knee caused by an oedema. I had a fall recently and was taken into hospital, where I was visited by a Royal Air Forces Association officer who found out about \u00a330,000 in benefits I hadn&apos;t known I was entitled to. That has made my life a lot easier. Prisoner of war life changes you. You learn not to get too close to someone because the next day they could be dead. I suppose that was why I never married. I could never let myself care too much. \u00b7 Do you have an experience to share?

What are the odds my offspring will have good eyesight if my future partner doesn&apos;t? It isn&apos;t possible to give exact odds because geneticists think both short-and long-sightednesses are caused by a combination of defective genes and environmental factors. A study at St Thomas&apos;s Hospital, London, that looked at the DNA of 221 pairs of identical and non-identical twins found that people with myopia (short-sightedness) had faults in the PAX6 gene, which controls how the eye develops. The researchers estimate that inherited factors account for 89% of the risk for short-sightedness and the environment accounts for 11%. But that won&apos;t give your children their personal odds. Now, when my mother said, &apos;Don&apos;t sit so close to the TV - it will ruin your eyes&apos;, I didn&apos;t believe her. But your child&apos;s risk of short-sightedness is increased by sitting too close to the TV, playing on game consoles and even reading too much.

If you&apos;ve got tick boxes that go beyond &apos;soul mate, good-looking, great in bed, makes me laugh&apos;, then what about &apos;no family history of heart disease, depression, alcoholism, colon cancer [certain types]&apos;?

While the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, takes the number one spot for the second year running, the real story of the new Forbes list is the dominance of Asian women. In second place comes Wu Yi, the vice- premier of China, a clear reflection of China&apos;s increasing hold over the global economy. Her ranking is also a recognition of her considerable forcefulness on the international stage. As Forbes notes, she stared down Henry Paulson, the US secretary to the treasury, during tough talks over the value of the Chinese currency. The list gets more intriguing with the inclusion, at number three, above even the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, of Ho Ching, chief executive of Singapore&apos;s state owned investment company Temasek (and wife of the prime minister). Not much is known about her but Forbes characterises her as a force to be reckoned with. She has overhauled Temasek, turning it into a regional powerhouse with a portfolio worth $108bn (\u00a354bn). Indra Nooyi, born in Chenai (Madras), is ranked in fifth place for her work as head of PepsiCo. She cuts an unusual figure, both as one of a new breed of prominent Asian businesswomen, and as someone unafraid to speak her mind. She caused a stir in the blogosphere in 2005 when she gave a speech to Columbia Business School in New York in which she likened US foreign policy to raising the middle finger to the rest of the world. (You have to wonder what No 60 on the list thinks of that: Laura Bush). The other leading woman at the top of the list, Sonia Gandhi, was born in Italy but is now dominant in the politics of her adopted country, India. Coming in at number six, her foreign-born status prevented her rising to the top but she is there in all but name as the president of the Indian National Congress. It was a woman, chosen by Mrs Gandhi, who is now India&apos;s first female president, Pratibha Patil. Lists of the sort in which Forbes has become the indisputable master have a way of coming unstuck if perused too closely. How, for instance, is it possible to argue that the Queen, at 23 up from 46 last year, is more powerful in 2007 than Nancy Pelosi ( 26), the first woman speaker of the US House of Representatives who is spearheading a Democratic shakeup of American politics? But what the list does is give a broad picture of the areas in which women are breaking through glass ceilings to reach the very pinnacle. Of the 100, 29 are involved in politics, headed by Mrs Merkel. Having made it clear at last year&apos;s G8 summit that she is not the kind to appreciate a cutesy massage from George Bush, she has gone on, in Forbes&apos; estimation, to grow &quot;increasingly comfortable with using her clout&quot;. Joining Mrs Merkel on the list as heads of government are Helen Clark, prime minister of New Zealand (38) and Luisa Diogo, prime minister of Mozambique (89). There are also five heads of state, including the Queen and the presidents of Chile and Finland. Among the remaining seats at this high table of female strength are some of the best known characters in America: Oprah Winfrey, Melinda Gates and Hillary Clinton. Drew Faust must take quiet satisfaction that her place on the list is a result of the fall of her predecessor as president of Harvard, Larry Summers, after he said women were innately less able at sciences. The rising forces of the east may be throwing up a plethora of powerful women, but for the time being US capitalism still holds sway across the world. Brit(ish) Seven women among the top 100 are classified by Forbes as of the UK. Only one - the Queen - is British-born. Two are naturalised British, the rest are merely based in the UK. Two Britons have fallen off the list: Margaret Beckett, now former foreign secretary, was at 29 last year, and Cherie Blair who was 62nd most powerful woman in 2005 has not made an appearance since. The Queen (at 23) aside, the six UK-listed women are: 7 Cynthia Carroll American, chief executive of the world&apos;s third-largest mining group, Anglo American 17 Marjorie Scardino American, chief executive of Pearson, owners of the Financial Times 54 Clara Furse British, born in Canada.

Roger Livesey is marvellous as Clive Candy, veteran of the Boer, and two world wars, a chivalrous man who is part pragmatic warrior, part soft-hearted romantic. Deborah Kerr plays all three of the women he loves and/or loses, and Anton Walbrook is the German officer who is promoted from deadly rival to lifelong friend. Golden Eye (Martin Campbell, 1995) 9.50pm, ITV1 It may be the post-communist, post-Sean, Roger and Timothy new world order, but the name is still Bond... James Bond, and some things don&apos;t change. OK, there&apos;s a new Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) and M is (gasp!) a woman (Judi Dench); but Pierce Brosnan, in his first 007 incarnation, is still an invincible super-agent foiling another plan for world domination, quipping his way through the run-down Soviet Union. Enigma (Michael Apted, 2001) 10.35pm, BBC2 This impressive wartime thriller is set among the code-breaking nerds and swots of Bletchley Park, as they rack their brains to crack the Germans&apos; Enigma machine. Dougray Scott is decently low-key as brilliant boffin Tom Jericho, infatuated with Saffron Burrows, and helped out no end in the war effort by Kate Winslet. While The City Sleeps (Fritz Lang, 1956) 1.30am, BBC2 One of the last films of the old master, Lang, this is a riveting, multifaceted film noir. A brutal sex murderer called the Lipstick Killer is stalking the city, and leading the hunt for him are not the police but three journalists - because whichever one cracks the case gets to run the newspaper. Sunday September 2 The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring (Peter Jackson, 2001) 5.45pm, C4 And lo, it came to pass that Jackson&apos;s epic screening of Tolkien&apos;s fantasy did conquer the world of men, this first, $300m chunk setting the Middle-earth scene with a combination of stunning New Zealand landscapes, computer-generated wizardry and awesome gothic design. The traditional quest plot kicks off with Elijah Wood&apos;s hairy-footed hobbit Frodo Baggins and his band of elf, human, dwarf and wizard friends (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellen and all) setting off to destroy the one ring. Alex And Emma (Rob Reiner, 2003) 8pm, Five Although apparently inspired by Dostoyevsky&apos;s struggle to write The Gambler, this is a risk-free, low-energy entertainment. Luke Wilson is a novelist with 30 days to write the bestseller that will pay off his betting debts, Kate Hudson the stenographer he hires, both also appearing in fantasy scenes from his 1920s-set tale. The Queen (Stephen Frears, 2006) 9pm, ITV1 Probably no accident that ITV decided to show this now: it&apos;s an intelligent and moving account of the week in the life of the royal family following Diana&apos;s death, 10 years ago this week. We see the royals, dazed at the news and bemused by the extraordinary outpouring of public grief, holed up in Balmoral, while public anger at their apparent indifference grows. But Helen Mirren&apos;s magnificent, Oscar-winning performance commands sympathy for the Queen - the product of an age when people mourned in private rather than in front of cameras - and admiration, too, at her dogged instinct for survival. Frears&apos; excellent drama is also very funny, particularly in the scenes between HRH and her new PM Tony Blair (Michael Sheen). The Bone Collector (Phillip Noyce, 1999) 9.55pm, Five Odd-couple cops on the trail of a nightmarish serial killer: we&apos;ve been here many times before. But what makes it worthwhile is Denzel Washington&apos;s performance as Detective Lincoln Rhyme, leading the investigation from his bed after being paralysed in an accident. So he directs rookie Angelina Jolie into those horrible dark places cops must go, bringing a touch of Rear Window-wit to the Seven-ish proceedings. As Good As It Gets (James L Brooks, 1997) 10pm, C4 Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for this, though their relationship in Brooks&apos;s polished, expensive-looking romantic comedy is barely credible. He&apos;s a phobically challenged, ultra-fastidious irascible old writer; she&apos;s a waitress at the one restaurant in town that still serves him. Beyond A Reasonable Doubt (Fritz Lang, 1956) 12.45am, BBC2 Fritz Lang&apos;s last Hollywood movie is a fitting sign-off: it may be low on budget, but it&apos;s a gritty little noir. Dana Andrews stars as a journo who plots with wealthy publisher Sidney Blackmer to get himself framed for murder, in order to illustrate the dangers of circumstantial evidence; but Blackmer dies, leaving him in the lurch on death row. Monday September 3 The Colditz Story (Guy Hamilton, 1954) 1pm, BBC2 An almost documentary-style account of British PoWs&apos; attempts to flee the prison at Colditz castle: sheer boredom and a sense of mischief seem to prompt the daring deeds. John Mills leads as Pat Reid, the great escaper on whose book the film is based. The Quick And The Dead (Sam Raimi, 1995) 10pm, C4 Raimi&apos;s stylish homage to Sergio Leone has Sharon Stone as a woman-with-no-name, complete with poncho and cigar, who is a lethal contender in a prize shootout in the two-bit town of Redemption. Quick-draw cast includes Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. Stoned (Stephen Woolley, 2005) 11.05pm, Five In his intriguing directorial debut, long-time producer Woolley delves into the murky waters surrounding the death of Rolling Stone Brian Jones. Leo Gregory is a sulky, resentful, unlovely Jones, locked into a vicious, near-abusive friendship with odd-jobbing builder Frank Thorogood (the excellent Paddy Considine). It&apos;s a gloomy business, short on Stones music, but nevertheless fascinating. The Dreamers (Bernardo Bertolucci, 2003) 1.40am, C4 An account of three young people in Paris in the heady, dangerous days of the May 1968 riots. Michael Pitt is Matthew, an American student drawn into a menage-a-trois with a beautiful, incestuous brother and sister (Louis Garrel, Eva Green). An evocative mix of sex, politics and cinema. Tuesday September 4 The Wooden Horse (Jack Lee, 1950) 1pm, BBC2 The fascination is in the detail: British PoWs attempt to escape from Stalag Luft III, and the daily grind of tunnelling under cover of a wooden gym horse is thoroughly convincing. Leo Genn, David Tomlinson and young Anthony Steel lead the burrowers; Jack Lee elicits all the claustrophobic tension of the tunnel. King Rat (Bryan Forbes, 1965) 11.20pm, BBC2 Like Billy Wilder&apos;s Stalag 17, a story of PoWs hustling for survival, but this recreation of the notorious Changi jail in Singapore, run by brutal Japanese soldiers, is altogether harsher. And George Segal&apos;s Corporal King, wheeling and dealing with fellow inmates&apos; possessions, is a more cynical character than William Holden&apos;s Sefton of the Stalag. Wednesday September 5 Once Upon A Time In Mexico (Robert Rodriguez, 2003) 9pm, Five The third appearance of the itinerant South American guitarist-cum-lethal gunman, and it&apos;s life pretty much as it was in the low-budget El Mariachi and the big studio follow-up Desperado. Antonio Banderas, star of the latter, is once again an ineffably cool and graceful hero up against gangs of sweaty bad guys down Mexico way. Buffy The Vampire Slayer (Fran Rubel Kuzui, 1992) 11.10pm, BBC1 The movie that launched the cult TV series, oddly without achieving that status itself. Kristy Swanson plays the San Fernando Valley girl accosted by creepy Merrick (Donald Sutherland), who tells her she is the chosen one - ie: it is her mission in life to slay vampires. Good, sharp-fanged fun. A Canterbury Tale (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1944) 11.50pm, BBC2 P&amp;P&apos;s curious, charming little tale has little to do with Chaucer, and is far from your usual spit-and-polished wartime flagwaver. It&apos;s set in a small village where three people - British sergeant Dennis Price, US sergeant John Sweet and a young woman (Sheila Sim) - meet up and try to track down a mysterious crank. Thursday September 6 Ill Met By Moonlight (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, 1957) 1.05pm, BBC2 Reconstruction of a daring second world war mission, when a British major and his men joined a partisan band to kidnap the German commander on Crete and spirit him across the sea to Cairo. The cross-country, night-time trek through enemy occupied territory to the waiting ship is gripping, but otherwise it&apos;s a humdrum affair. Laura (Otto Preminger, 1944) 1.45pm, BBC2 Preminger&apos;s thriller casts a jaundiced eye over the conventions of film noir. So we have a maybe-murder, with Gene Tierney the beautiful, enigmatic victim; Dana Andrews the bemused cop, and playboy Vincent Price a likely suspect. Cynical, ironic and flawlessly executed. The Big Heat (Fritz Lang, 1953) 12.05am, BBC2 A definitive film noir that booked its place in cinema history with the infamous scene in which Lee Marvin&apos;s brutal gangster throws boiling coffee into Gloria Grahame&apos;s face. The world is indeed a savage place here, the protagonists trapped in the confining interiors of Charles Lang Jr&apos;s shadowy photography. Friday September 7 In Which We Serve (No\u00ebl Coward, David Lean, 1942) 10.40am, BBC2 This wartime tribute to the Royal Navy is something of a landmark: it launched David Lean on his illustrious directing career, and Richard Attenborough and Celia Johnson made their screen debuts. Told mainly in flashback, it has the survivors of a U-boat attack in a life raft in the Mediterranean, recalling their pasts. Titanic (Jean Negulesco, 1953) 1.35pm, C4 An account of the sinking of the unsinkable. Unlike Cameron&apos;s 1997 version, it&apos;s a little short on special effects; and unlike A Night To Remember, this is a standard Hollywood disaster movie grafted on to the real-life event. Which accounts for glamorous mum Barbara Stanwyck being on board with her two children, having done a runner from husband Clifton Webb. Robert Wagner bobs up too."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/03/becomingeconomiccitizens", "sentences": ["In Britain, the debate about economic democracy was last seriously led more than 10 years ago, when Will Hutton published his book The State We&apos;re In and Tony Blair, at the time still Leader of the opposition, promised in his Singapore speech:  &quot;it is surely time to assess how we shift the emphasis in corporate ethos - from the company being a mere vehicle for the capital market - to be traded, bought and sold as a commodity; towards a vision of the company as a community of partnership in which each employee has a stake, and where a company&apos;s responsibilities are more clearly delineated.&quot;  Where are we a decade later?"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-03T08:30:00Z", "title": "Becoming economic citizens", "tags": ["Economics", "Business", "Money", "Equality", "Germany", "Tony Blair", "Europe"], "article": "In the general debate about globalisation, it is a widely held assumption that the scope of action of democratic governments is deteriorating due to advancing economic integration. The bringing down of trade barriers, the shift to a more service based economy and innovations in ICTs have led to business operations going further beyond national borders than ever before. This is generally a good development. Unfortunately however, this expansion of economic activity has not yet been mirrored by a corresponding extension of democratic governance. As a result, the ability of democratic politics to regulate the economy has diminished. This all too often leads to unsustainable inequalities within and between countries. In this context there is some serious debate going on about the development of regional and global governance structures to regain the primacy of democratic politics. This is a vital discussion that needs to be pushed forward. But it seems strange that the direct application of democratic values within economic structures themselves, rather than in the political realm, is rarely considered in these days. There are examples where applied democratic principles in the economic sphere have produced real benefits. For instance, one of the achievements of the German social market economy Martin Kettle talked about on Comment is free last week is exactly the application of these democratic values in corporate governance. The German system of co-determination, allowing employees to take part in corporate decisions, has become a cornerstone of the social market economy and has had many positive effects. It injected stability into the corporate decision-making process and - contrary to many stereotypes - has also had positive economic effects. Co-determination motivates the workforce by inclusion in decision-making procedures and reduces transaction costs as well as information asymmetries. In Britain, the debate about economic democracy was last seriously led more than 10 years ago, when Will Hutton published his book The State We&apos;re In and Tony Blair, at the time still Leader of the opposition, promised in his Singapore speech:  &quot;it is surely time to assess how we shift the emphasis in corporate ethos - from the company being a mere vehicle for the capital market - to be traded, bought and sold as a commodity; towards a vision of the company as a community of partnership in which each employee has a stake, and where a company&apos;s responsibilities are more clearly delineated.&quot;  Where are we a decade later? There are no more stakeholding elements in the economy than in the mid-1990s. And worse, even the discussion about democracy in corporate governance is dead in the water. I am not suggesting that Britain should simply copy the German model of co-determination. Policy transfers from other countries can only take place in the context of their own economic tradition. But maybe a new debate about possible democratic elements in the economic realm is in order. More democracy in corporate governance could help to rebalance the relationship between shareholder value and employee interest and be a tool for real societal stakeholding rather than passive participation in the economic process. Democratic principles are sometimes exported to other countries, even by means of war and yet large parts of the western world seem worried about applying them to their own economic structures. Would it be so wrong if an employee became more of an economic citizen than a production factor?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/03/travel.travelnews", "sentences": ["The superjumbo is at least two years late in entering service because of technical and production delays but the first commercial flight, operated by Singapore Airlines, will take place next month."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-03T12:06:36Z", "title": "Airbus looks to China for lift off", "tags": ["Business", "Travel", "EADS", "Airbus"], "article": "Airbus, the troubled European plane-maker, expects Chinese airlines to buy more than 100 of its A380 superjumbos over the next 20 years to meet booming demand for air travel.

So BP added 10.5p to 561p while Royal Dutch Shell rose 58p to \u00a319.79. Shell was also helped by analysts at UBS moving their recommendation from neutral to buy.   Still with oil, exploration group Soco soared 148p to \u00a321.65. The company announced a rise in half-year profits from $15m to $17m and said it was confident a prospect in Vietnam would yield recoverable reserves of at least 1bn barrels of oil equivalent.   Tullow Oil was also wanted, up 34p to 547p after an upbeat outlook statement about its potential reserves.   Overall the FTSE 100 climbed 27.1 points to 6342.3, helped by a positive set of US manufacturing figures for August which gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average an early lift after Monday&apos;s Labor Day holiday.

Again, UBS cut its price target, down from 880p to 805p.   Elsewhere Drax, owner of Europe&apos;s biggest coal-fired power station, climbed 11p to 676.5p after Citigroup moved its recommendation from sell to hold, with a 652p target price.   However the bank warned: &quot;If coal prices don&apos;t moderate, or electricity prices increase, the risk to valuation is firmly to the downside.&quot;   Miner Kazakhmys was 34p better at \u00a313.33 after it announced a 22% rise in half-year profits and a $700m return to shareholders via a buyback and special dividend.   But property stocks were weaker after shopping centre specialist Hammerson warned of trickier retail conditions, and JP Morgan cut its price targets for a number of companies. So despite a 9% rise in first half asset value, Hammerson fell 7p to \u00a313.27. Rival Liberty International lost 14p to \u00a311.83 as JP Morgan reduced its target from \u00a313.75 to \u00a311.50.   Among the mid-caps, cake and bread retailer Greggs lost 236p to \u00a350.50 on fears that rising wheat prices would hit its profits.   Brit Insurance fell 10p to 344p after posting flat first-half profits and issuing a cautious forecast. Evolution Securities advised investors to reduce their holdings, saying the UK commercial market where Brit is heavily involved could take 12 to 18 months to turn around.

A couple of bid approaches lower down the market caused a bit of excitement.   Computer games group SCi Entertainment jumped 44.5p to 384p on news of an approach, while a possible cash offer for drug testing specialist Cozart saw its shares jump 10.75p to 51.5p.   But property minnow Erinaceous - which recently revealed takeover talks had fallen through - lost 10.75p to 110.5p. The company, whose results are due out on 25 September, has been a target for short sellers in the past but traders believe most of these are now out of the stock.   Finally marketing services group Media Square -which last year rejected a \u00a345m bid believed to have come from 7% shareholder, the investment vehicle Promethean - dropped 2.625p to 6.125p today after a profit warning.

The company has refused to name names but today, however, the French newspaper Le Figaro identified the buyer as none other than Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club and Russia&apos;s richest man with a fortune of $18.7bn (\u00a39.4bn).

Drax, owner of Europe&apos;s biggest coal-fired power station, climbed 11p to 676.5p as Citigroup moved its recommendation from sell to hold, with a 652p target. However, the bank warned: &quot;If coal prices don&apos;t moderate, or electricity prices increase, the risk to valuation is firmly to the downside.&quot; But property stocks fell after the shopping centre specialist Hammerson warned of trickier retail conditions, and JP Morgan cut its price targets for a number of companies. So despite a 9% rise in first-half asset value, Hammerson fell 7p to \u00a313.27. Its rival Liberty International lost 14p to \u00a311.83 as JP Morgan reduced its target from \u00a313.75 to \u00a311.50. Among mid-caps, the bakery chain Greggs lost 236p to \u00a350.50 on fears that rising wheat prices would hit its profits. Brit Insurance fell 10p to 344p after posting flat first-half profits and issuing a cautious forecast. Evolution Securities advised investors to reduce their holdings, saying the UK commercial market, where Brit is heavily involved, could take 12 to 18 months to turn around. And Carphone Warehouse fell 1p to 356.5p as BSkyB confirmed it planned a standalone broadband product, which could provide further competition. The media group SMG fell 8.25p to 37.25p on talk that Goldman Sachs was placing about 42m shares at 40.5p each. A couple of bid approaches lower down the market caused of excitement. The computer games group SCi Entertainment jumped 44.5p to 384p on news of an approach, while a possible cash offer for the drug-testing specialist Cozart saw its shares jump 10.75p to 51.5p. Finally, the marketing services group Media Square - which rejected a \u00a345m bid last year - dropped 2.625p to 6.125p after a profit warning. Ikea link IT group K3 Business Technology has been busy this week. Yesterday it bought Dutch retail software business Landsteinar for \u00a39.87m in cash and shares. The key attraction of the deal is that Landsteinar is a key supplier of software to global furnishing retailer Ikea. According to K3&apos;s broker Daniel Stewart, Landsteinar is expected to derive 45% of this year&apos;s revenues from Ikea franchises and will benefit from the Swedish group&apos;s expansion programme. Non-Ikea revenues are also said to be growing strongly. Meanwhile on Monday, K3 sold 4.4m shares - a 3.3% stake - in consultancy and systems group Sirvis IT, steady at 4p, to Southwind, an investment vehicle of entrepreneur Bob Morton. K3 closed 5.5p higher at 164.5p. Daniel Stewart has a five-year price target of 221p for K3. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/06/cricket.englandcricketseries1", "sentences": ["The big hitters Most runs scored in a one-day international over 36 Herschelle Gibbs, South Africa v Netherlands, St Kitts, 2006-07 32 Shahid Afridi, Pakistan v New Zealand, Abu Dhabi, 2007 30 Dimitri Mascarenhas, England v India, The Oval, 2007 30 Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka v Pakistan, Singapore, 1995-96 30 Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka v New Zealand, Sharjah, 2000-01"], "publicationDate": "2007-09-05T23:08:58Z", "title": "Five times six makes Twenty20 for Mascarenhas", "tags": ["Sport", "Cricket", "England v India 2007", "Twenty20"], "article": "The Oval has played host to many a late try for an England tour place over the years, but none has been quite as spectacular as the one that was launched here yesterday by Dimitri Mascarenhas. With as many as three places in England&apos;s injury-hit Twenty20 squad potentially up for grabs, Mascarenhas, who was part of the preliminary 30-man party but did not make the final 15, stated his case by hitting sixes off each of the last five balls of the England innings, which was bowled by India&apos;s left-arm spinner Yuvraj Singh. Only South Africa&apos;s Herschelle Gibbs with 36 and Pakistan&apos;s Shahid Afridi with 32 have taken more runs off an over in one-day internationals, and only Gibbs has hit more sixes. England fly to Johannesburg on Sunday and they would do well to take Mascarenhas with them. &quot;I&apos;ve been hitting sixes at the end of an innings for Hampshire more consistently over the past four or five years,&quot; said the 29-year-old, who has now hit 10 of them in his five one-day internationals to go with a solitary four. &quot;But the most I&apos;ve hit before in an over has been three. Obviously with all the injuries there&apos;s a chance I&apos;ll go to South Africa, and the selectors have said so. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m doing myself too much harm at the moment.&quot; Yet his 11th-hour tour de force might never have happened. Having failed to score off Yuvraj&apos;s opening delivery he hoisted the second ball in the direction of Piyush Chawla at deep midwicket. Chawla clung on but could not prevent himself tumbling on to the rope in the process. After that, luck gave way to hitting of the cleanest kind. The next three deliveries were deposited into the crowd between midwicket and square-leg and the final ball was plonked back over Yuvraj&apos;s head into the seats beneath the pavilion. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen hitting as big as that,&quot; said the India captain, Rahul Dravid. &quot;After the first ball I told Yuvraj he&apos;d probably top-edge the next one. But after the third six I gave up saying anything.&quot; The England captain, Paul Collingwood, admitted that the defeat was &quot;tough to take&quot; after England had rattled up 316 for six and he jokingly thanked Sky for showing replays of him failing to make his ground on the Oval&apos;s giant screen after the umpire Peter Hartley, standing in his first international match, had initially failed to refer India&apos;s appeal for the run-out. &quot;I was just asking him if he&apos;s allowed to see it on the screen first, then ask for the replay,&quot; said Collingwood. &quot;It was obviously a little bit of a mistake from the umpire. He&apos;s a great bloke, but mistakes do happen. It was disappointing at the time, because at first he didn&apos;t want to have a look at the TV replay but suddenly he did when it appeared on the big screen. So thanks very much to Sky for putting it up there.&quot; At least Collingwood could still smile. But if England happen to lose the seven-match series decider at Lord&apos;s, after taking a 3-1 lead last Thursday at Old Trafford, the smiles will be very forced on Saturday evening.

In the latest of a series of aerial incidents reminiscent of the cold war, four Tornado F3s from RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire, and RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, were scrambled early yesterday followed by an E3 early warning radar aircraft and a refuelling tanker to shadow eight Russian Tupolev Tu-95 &quot;Bears&quot;. The Tu-95s were designed as bombers but are now frequently used for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft, originally shadowed by Norwegian F-16s, were &quot;approaching but not in British airspace&quot;, said the Ministry of Defence, which played down the interception as &quot;routine Nato procedure&quot;. The Russians were &quot;upgrading and exercising their capabilities&quot;, a defence official said. He added: &quot;It is not the start of a new cold war.&quot; Nonetheless, the latest episode came against a backdrop of shifting military and strategic positioning in recent months that has seen Nato extend its presence deep into Moscow&apos;s former empire, the Russians court the Chinese in the biggest war games between the two countries, and the US develop a military relationship with Moscow&apos;s traditional ally, India. Mr Putin served notice last month of his intention to resume long-range bomber flights which were discontinued after the fall of the Soviet Union. He said Russia was restarting the flights because other countries had failed to stick by an agreement to scrap the cold war practice. Two of the RAF&apos;s new Eurofighter Typhoon jets were scrambled in August as a TU-95 flew over the north Atlantic. In May, two Tornados intercepted a TU-95 observing a Royal Navy exercise. Defence and diplomatic sources said such incidents were likely to become more frequent. The incidents coincided with acute diplomatic difficulties between London and Moscow over the Litvinenko affair. The Foreign Office said in a statement that bilateral relations with Russia &quot;continue unaffected outside the unresolved Lugovoi extradition request&quot; - a reference to Moscow&apos;s refusal to extradite the former KGB bodyguard suspected of the murder of Litvinenko in London last year. The Kremlin said yesterday that 14 of its strategic Tu-95MS bombers had taken off on Wednesday night on long-range missions across the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The aircraft had flown over &quot;remote regions&quot; and had not penetrated the airspace of any foreign country, Russia&apos;s air force commander, Alexander Drobyshevsky, told the Russian news agency Interfax. Despite the Foreign Office statement, official relations between Moscow and London have more or less ceased following the Litvinenko affair, and the tit-for tat expulsion in July of four Russian and four British diplomats. Reports that yet another Russian oligarch, the oil baron Mikhail Gutseriyev, has recently fled to London have done little to ease the strain. As well as showing that Russia is a resurgent military power, Mr Putin has also gone out of his way to show that regional blocs outside Nato are growing in strength and influence. Nato, meanwhile, recently announced a big naval exercise based on the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Sevastopol next week, a move likely to annoy Moscow. Sevastopol was formerly the Soviet Union&apos;s principal warm-water port. Last month Russia and China staged a series of elaborate war games with four central Asian countries. Yesterday Mr Putin signed a $1bn (\u00a3500m) deal with Indonesia, the world&apos;s most populous Islamic country, to provide assault helicopters, amphibious tanks and advanced submarines - expanding Moscow&apos;s military reach deep into south-east Asia. One British defence expert expressed surprise that Russia was continuing to mount expensive long-range bomber missions on a big scale. But he said Russia&apos;s ageing Tu-95s posed little more than a symbolic threat. &quot;It&apos;s willy-waving,&quot; Robert Hewson, editor of Jane&apos;s Air-Launched Weapons, told the Guardian. &quot;They are out to make a point, that they are still here, and that they can&apos;t be forgotten about or ignored. But it isn&apos;t something anyone has to worry about.&quot; The Russian bombers were flying the same &quot;well-worn&quot; route that Soviet pilots used to take in the 1970s and 1980s, threading through a gap between Greenland and Iceland, Mr Hewson said. Then the flights took place daily but ended abruptly in the 1990s when Russia ran out of cash. Games without frontiers A burst of war games and military manoeuvres around the world hints at a new strategic landscape. \u00b7 Nato plans next week to conduct exercises in Sevastopol, the Black Sea port once in the Soviet Union but now part of Ukraine. The exercises involve three former Soviet republics not yet in Nato: Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine. \u00b7 The US, Japan, Australia and Singapore this week staged five days of war exercises in the Bay of Bengal with India. \u00b7 Russia and China held their largest ever war games in the Urals last month. \u00b7 China has built an intelligence listening post on the Cocos Islands in the Bay of Bengal and is helping Pakistan and Bangladesh to build deep-water ports its navy could use."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/08/patrickbarkham.uknews4", "sentences": ["He will publish a paper on the 2.7% finding, a &quot;statistically significant improvement&quot;, at a sports science conference in Singapore next month."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-08T00:20:25Z", "title": "The Ionic Man - will a vest decide who wins rugby's biggest prize?", "tags": ["UK news"], "article": "IonX is a new shirt with an ego so large it&apos;s a wonder that it deigns to be worn on your back at all. This boastful piece of polyester and elastane is the latest piece of kit that may propel England to rugby glory. And if it doesn&apos;t, then the same magic fabric worn by Australia, South Africa, Ireland, Scotland and Japan will surely be a World Cup winner. The competition started last night, and with England - the defending champions - playing their first match later today, the pundits believe the cup holders will need all the help they can get if they are to triumph once again. Shirts used to be jerseys. Then they promised to keep you hot or cool, or efficiently dispel your sweat. Now IonX, developed over three years by New Zealand-based kitmaker Canterbury, claims to deliver &quot;ionic&quot; energy to the body through a negatively charged electromagnetic field. Eh? You may think it&apos;s easy to sell shirts to large men suggestible enough to bury their heads in each others&apos; thighs for 80 minutes, but the manufacturers claim to have created a fabric coated in a liquid wash that when placed against the skin creates a negative charge of ions. Ionisation, and the physical benefit of negative ions, has a slightly shady history: during the second world war German scientists placed bombers in ionising chambers to increase their strength. Athletes in the Soviet Union later used ionisation in the spirit of cold war competitiveness. It is claimed that research suggests this negative charge helps increase blood flow and the supply of oxygen to the muscles, enabling them to work harder, recover more quickly and get rid of waste products that build up in exercise, such as lactic acid. Can a shirt really do this, or is it pseudo-scientific gobbledegook? IonX is backed by one piece of scientific research funded by Canterbury: Mike Cain of Loughborough University found the shirts delivered a 2.7% improvement in athletes&apos; &quot;peak power&quot; in short bursts of high impact exercise on cycling machines. Dr Cain is cautious about the benefits and admitted that more research needs to be done. Although his testing of the shirts was funded by Canterbury, he insisted that his &quot;independence is critical to the credibility of what we do&quot;. He will publish a paper on the 2.7% finding, a &quot;statistically significant improvement&quot;, at a sports science conference in Singapore next month. Meanwhile, the Guardian thought it would rigorously test IonX by making its least-likely-to-excel-at-rugby reporter run up London&apos;s steepest hill. Taking Dr Cain&apos;s advice, I put on the tight, white IonX base layer (as worn by the England players), a snip at \u00a345, half-an-hour before beginning. For decorative effect, I put a Scotland IonX shirt over the top. Dr Cain said an extra shirt would make no difference - what matters is that one of these shirts is tight against your skin. Slightly rubbery and as snug as a wetsuit, the shirt felt like it was trying to throttle me. It was also very warm. But hang on, as I struggled up the hill I felt different. The suggestible bit of my brain concluded that yes, the blood seemed to be pumping round my puny upper body with a bit more vigour than usual. Did I feel 2.7% better? Hell yes! Although maybe that was just because it was a pleasant afternoon out of the office. They say that tiny advantages can snatch victory from defeat in professional sport. But amateurs like me could easily find a 2.7% improvement in running up that hill by forsaking the lunchtime curry. And modern sports science would probably vouch for another 2.7% improvement if I hadn&apos;t got a hangover. From &quot;Fastskin&quot; swimsuits to those plasters that footballers briefly put on their noses, sports stars and big brands have short-lived infatuations with new technology. Will IonX stand the test of time? If those nations not wearing the technology - France or New Zealand - win the World Cup, the world&apos;s most boastful shirt may shout a little less loudly."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/09/escape.laos", "sentences": ["Direct flights to Luang Prabang run from Bangkok, Singapore, Siem Reap (Angkor), Vientiane and Hanoi."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-09T14:24:22Z", "title": "Who are you calling Dumbo?", "tags": ["Travel", "Laos holidays", "Adventure travel", "Asia"], "article": "&apos;Sai,&apos; I shout, attempting to be authoritative. &apos;Sai, sai!&apos; In elephant lingo it&apos;s supposed to mean left. But Nam is having none of it. She is marching straight into the bush, with no regard for my command.  I&apos;ve signed up for a mahout course, and spent the morning trying to get my elephant driving skills right. But something seems to be lost in translation. Nam has spotted some succulent branches, and does not care that the more spiky ones are hitting my face as she tramples forth. I hang on to her ears for dear life.  For several days, I have been enjoying the cultural sights of Luang Prabang, the former royal capital of Laos. The south-east Asian nation is fast becoming a popular destination with travellers, and Luang Prabang is the highlight. It&apos;s a beautiful town on the Mekong river, mixing Buddhist temples with French colonial mansions in a mountainous jungle landscape. Despite decades of war and 30 years of communist rationalisation, Luang Prabang has managed to keep alive its historical identity and its tradition as a Buddhist spiritual centre.  But after several days of sightseeing, it&apos;s time to get more active. In just two days, I can learn how to ride an elephant. While a number of travel companies offer elephant rides in the vicinity of town, there&apos;s only one that teaches you the secrets of being a mahout. I sign up.  The elephant camp is just a few miles outside town, yet we&apos;re deep into the jungle. The location - on the Nam Khan river, a Mekong tributary - is stunning, surrounded by high jagged mountains.  I&apos;ve been assigned Nam. Or maybe it&apos;s me who&apos;s been assigned to her. She is a 46-year-old female elephant who used to work in the logging industry, bringing down trees. In elephant years, she is a grand old lady and has retired. Nam - one of five elephants in the camp - is a beautiful beast, and for the next two days we will eat, bathe and go for rides together. If I manage to climb on top of her.  Mahouts scale these animals as if they were mere donkeys. By contrast, it takes me several ungraceful tries, and in the end, a good push on the bum to climb Nam. I&apos;m only three metres off the ground, but I feel dizzy. The guide down there looks so tiny. I&apos;ve been on a horse before, but this is different. On an elephant, you actually sit on its head, and there is neither saddle nor reins. To get a stable position, I have to learn how to squeeze my knees together behind her ears. At first, I desperately grab her ears for stability. It takes a while to get confident enough to let go.  I have also tried to learn the commands, but in my slightly panicked state they are difficult to remember. I&apos;ve learnt that &apos;pai&apos; is &apos;forward&apos;, &apos;ho&apos; means &apos;stop&apos; and &apos;map&apos; is an order to sit. &apos;Quoa&apos; is supposed to make her go right, and then there&apos;s &apos;sai&apos; which the instructor insists means &apos;left&apos;, but I clearly haven&apos;t got the authority to pull it off yet.  Nam knows the way anyway; she has been doing this several times a day for a long time. After some more training and practice, we finally seem to understand each other. The &apos;hos&apos; and &apos;maps&apos; seem to work better, or maybe she is just humouring me. At least she doesn&apos;t rush off for food all the time. I even manage to look at my jungle surroundings and appreciate their beauty.  We round the day off by taking the elephants to a clearing in the forest, where they will stay for the night. Our instructors tie one ankle of each animal with a long iron chain twisted around a tree. If you want to keep elephants, building fences is pointless. They will trample them in seconds.  We stay over at the elephant camp, in a nice lodge on the other side of the river. I hook up with three other mahout wannabes on the terrace. We exchange tips and stories from our long and extensive experience with the elephants - all six hours of it. As the sun and the compulsory Beer Lao go down, the stories get better.  After breakfast the next morning, we take Nam and the other elephants down to the river bank for their morning bath. A small crowd has assembled. It&apos;s the camp&apos;s other lodgers, who have got up to watch the elephant bathing, and the mahout class is the morning attraction. I barely manage to maintain my jungle cred as I hang on for dear life.  But this is fantastic fun. We&apos;re in the river, splashing about. It&apos;s a big commotion - the elephants are quite playful, using their trunks to hose us down. We&apos;ve been given brushes, and I&apos;m scrubbing Nam as hard as I can. Her skin is extremely tough and coarse, so it&apos;s hard work scraping off all the dirt. Our last job as mahouts is to feed the animals. Nam has been eating away in the jungle all morning, of course, but there&apos;s still plenty of room for bananas and sugar cane. She gobbles up one bunch of bananas after another, and I&apos;m amazed how fast and precise her trunk is.  Eventually, it&apos;s time to say goodbye. My &apos;sai&apos; and &apos;pai&apos; were coming on nicely, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be quitting the day job just yet. \u00b7 A two-day mahout course costs $119 (\u00a360) per person.

A raucous chorus of courting frogs reverberated from the inky blackness as we studied the food stalls. Fried black beetles and roachy bugs sat in glistening, crispy piles alongside more appetising looking freshwater shrimps. We mused on the reasons why we eat crustaceans but not insects, deciding it was largely because all the filthy things that prawns do in the sea are out of sight and out of mind. Early next morning we boarded an &apos;express&apos; boat for the seven-hour journey to Siem Reap, home to the temples of Angkor. En route small boats paddled out to add local passengers to our payload. Two guys running late attempted to scramble into a slim vessel to come and meet us. Then our wake hit them. In tragi-comedic slow motion their rocking canoe filled with water and capsized, dumping the poor prospective passengers unceremoniously in the drink. Lurching on with a pronounced starboard tilt, our vessel rolled violently as the captain threw it into unfeasibly sharp turns on the winding, narrow watercourse. Pondering our lack of stability, I mentally prepared an &apos;abandon ship&apos; plan. We were now travelling through extensive fields of marijuana plants 10 feet tall - not the worst place to be shipwrecked, I thought. The muddy channel reminded me strangely of the Norfolk Broads, though weed, not reed, was the riverbank crop of choice. There was also a merciful absence of pleasure boats crewed by drunken stag parties playing &apos;chicken&apos; and crashing into each other. The final leg of the journey took us into Tonle Sap, Asia&apos;s largest lake. Reaching 13,000 square kilometres in size during the rainy season, it was huge, empty and rather lonely. Suddenly our elderly, listing boat felt somewhat vulnerable. A passing tour boat of neatly seated, life-jacketed Japanese made our rag-tag bunch of lolling safety-oblivious westerners look like the epitome of nautical fecklessness. Two days of tramping round temples later we were on the notorious, bum-breaking &apos;disco bus&apos; from Siem Reap to the Thai border. According to slow travel conspiracy theorists, the appalling state of this road is attributable to a covert deal between a certain airline and the Cambodian government not to resurface the highway - thereby securing business from more anally sensitive passengers for the trip between Bangkok and Siem Reap. Allegedly. The road did not live up to its reputation. It was rutted and bumpy, but &apos;at least our bums stayed on our seats&apos;, as Fi put it. On other bus journeys, dubious suspension and potholed road surfaces combined to create moments of weightlessness leavened only by the sharp crack of skull on luggage rack above. On the Siem Reap bus we fell asleep. One night in Bangkok is supposed to be enough to make the world your oyster. So we recklessly spent two to ensure the rest of the trip is a pearl. We then hopped a sleeper train south towards Singapore. At the Malaysian border a rather fearsome sign on the immigration office wall read: &apos;How to identify an alien with &quot;hippy&quot; characteristics.&apos; The &apos;giveaway&apos; signs included: &apos;Wearing singlet without innerwear, unrespectable shorts, sandals (that are not part of national costume), unrespectable silk pants, dirty or untidy hair and an impolite manner.&apos; We looked nervously at each other in our baggy linen trousers and flip-flops, Fi with her sarong slung loosely round her neck. &apos;Persons matching this description,&apos; the sign continued, &apos;will be immediately deport.&apos; Thankfully they let us in. &apos;Hippy thinking&apos; is obviously not on the watch-list. Yet. In Georgetown, on the Malaysian island of Penang, we got talking to Bob and Angela, a couple of &apos;grey nomads&apos; from the UK. On an antiques-buying mission for their house on neighbouring Langkawi, they&apos;d signed up to the &apos;Malaysia My Second Home&apos; programme, which encourages immigration of retired ex-pats. &apos;They might as well call it the &apos;Old Farts Come to Die Campaign,&apos; observed Bob. \u00b7 lowcarbontravel.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2007/sep/11/gettingserious2", "sentences": ["At last month&apos;s State of Play conference, where the great and the many descended upon Singapore, there was a panel dedicated to the various uses of virtual world technologies for the greater good (in addition to the entertainment functions)."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-11T08:52:54Z", "title": "Getting serious about virtual worlds", "tags": ["Virtual worlds", "Events", "Games", "Technology"], "article": "We&apos;ve spoken on this blog in the past about the possibilities for game technologies to be relevant for all kinds of non-gaming enterprises: governance, health, education, television, film, radio, public participation, military strategy.

I had the chance to ask David Wortley, the Director of the Serious Games Institute at Coventry University and the man behind the Serious Virtual Worlds Conference, a few questions of my own. Why all the fuss about virtual worlds? Virtual worlds are getting increasing attention because they herald the 3D web. The converging technologies of broadband, wireless, computing, video and sound have matured to the point where multiplayer immersive environments are available in a practical and usable way to a mass audience and an increasing number of people are exploring the potential of virtual worlds for a variety of applications, most notably social networking. What do virtual worlds offer the serious games community that traditional gaming does not? Virtual worlds offer opportunities for developing and tailoring your own environments and applications in a more accessible way than traditional gaming. Environments like Second Life provide the ability to create your own space and explore new applications in a highly creative way. Virtual worlds are to traditional games what Web 2.0 is to the traditional web. What do you feel is a particularly good example of a serious use of a virtual world? One of my favourites is the Wheelies site in Second Life. The reason for this is not the site per se, but the empowering effect the development of this site has had on its owner, Simon Stevens. Simon suffers from cerebral palsy and is a very intelligent young man who has endured discrimination and hardship from birth because of his speech impairment. Developing the Wheelies site (where his avatar is in a wheelchair) has had a marvellous transforming effect on his life. They&apos;re not a global panacea - what are some of the criticisms for using virtual worlds for serious ends? The main criticism is lack of security and control in environments like Second Life. Just as in real life, the human imagination knows no bounds for good or evil and the insecurity and unpredictability of some environments limited their use for business purposes. In a social context, they can also have a negative effect if they become a substitute for human contact. The health, education and corporate communities have been interested in virtual environments in the past. What makes now different from the gold-rush days of LambdaMOO and other mid-90s virtual environments? The most important difference is the way all the technologies have now matured to the point where the virtual environments are more realistic, more usable and more immersive. Just as in games and the theatre, it is the suspension of disbelief that helps to engage people. The technologies to do this are now much more widely accessible and the media and young people increasingly raise awareness in a way which wasn&apos;t there in the 90&apos;s Commercial virtual worlds also present another obstacle: that of corporate ownership. How can serious games stakeholders ensure that their messages aren&apos;t diluted by a virtual world brand and its interests? This is a hot issue and I guess it will only be resolved when there is a wider choice of platforms and solutions. Second Life has been grabbing most of the headlines lately, but which future platforms do you see with great promise on the horizon? At the Serious Games Institute in Coventry, as well as working with Second Life, we are developing a relationship with the Forterra Olive platform which has the attraction of a more open interface to industry standard tools like 3D Studio Max. We also like the drag and drop capabilities of Visual 3D which should provide some very interesting applications and we are working with Giunti Labs in Italy and Cisco to explore augmented reality applications. Closer to home, Blitz Games and PixeLearning have developed their own platforms and companies such as Caspian Learning in Sunderland and Immersive Education in Oxford have provided good platforms for the education sector. Farther from home, I expect to see some challenges from the Far East."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/sep/11/highereducationprofile.highereducation", "sentences": ["Indeed, Thrift&apos;s predecessor, Professor David VanderLinde, drew up plans for Warwick to open a branch in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-11T22:55:56Z", "title": "Interview: Nigel Thrift", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news"], "article": "Today Warwick University unveils a plan to become the first British campus to open an international quarter, hosting three or four overseas research universities. As a result, the campus, on the southern edge of Coventry, is likely to grow by 40% over the next eight years. The proposal is part of a strategy to &quot;bring together the most talented staff and students in the world and allow them to take off again on professional and personal journeys which are likely to include all four quarters of the globe&quot;. Warwick claims it will be among the top 50 universities worldwide by 2015. And it intends to be an intellectual gateway to the UK. The strategy&apos;s author, vice-chancellor Nigel Thrift, is evidently fond of gateways. His International Gateway for Gifted Youth is already up and running. Known as Iggy, it&apos;s website went live last week. It&apos;s an online academy, with annual summer schools, that will link the university to some of the brightest schoolchildren on the planet. Having the cleverest in the UK, it seems, is no longer enough. Warwick declined an invitation to extend its five-year contract to run the National Association for Gifted and Talented Youth over concerns about the separation of delivery from management. Among Thrift&apos;s other proposals are a \u00a33.5m investment in Warwick Arts Centre and an Olympic swimming pool on campus. Thrift arrived at Warwick just over a year ago from Oxford, where he had been pro vice-chancellor for research. He is a fellow of the British Academy and one of the top five most-cited geographers in the world, with 35 books under his belt. His 36th, written with Paul Glennie from Bristol University, is due to be finished this month. It&apos;s about the history of time in England and Wales from 1300 to 1800 - and the miracle is that he found the time to write it. &quot;It&apos;s important that I keep up my research career and demonstrate that it&apos;s possible for even a vice-chancellor to produce,&quot; he says, before settling down to yet another working lunch. Thrift peers suspiciously through the transparent wrapping of one of several packs sent up to his office from a catering unit. &quot;Good God! What&apos;s that?&quot; he exclaims, pointing at a tortilla filled with something squidgy, and adding: &quot;I can never see the point of wraps.&quot; Eventually he settles for a single sandwich, a banana from his fruit bowl and another cup of coffee - and urges me to eat the rest. He begins to outline his vision of Warwick&apos;s future. &quot;One of the major tendencies for the next 10 to 15 years is that many universities will realise that they have to collaborate in order to compete,&quot; he says. &quot;We want genuine collaborations with three or four universities abroad.&quot; But he&apos;s not saying which ones. &quot;Let&apos;s just say that they&apos;re in North America and Asia.&quot; Other British universities have already opened campuses in Asia. Nottingham, for instance, has outposts in Malaysia and Ningbo in China. Indeed, Thrift&apos;s predecessor, Professor David VanderLinde, drew up plans for Warwick to open a branch in Singapore. &quot;After a lengthy internal debate and a considered decision, the senate decided not to go ahead with that,&quot; the current vice-chancellor says. &quot;Trying to set up a 10,000-student university there was considered just too ambitious.&quot; Instead of setting up halfway across the world, Thrift has now turned the idea on its head and invited the world to come to Coventry. He sees Warwick University as a sort of intellectual Heathrow. As a prominent member of the Royal Geographical Society, he has put his name to statements drawing attention to the damaging effects of the north-south divide and called for the decentralisation of ministries, the judiciary, and institutions such as the Arts Council. That approach seems to have seeped into his ideas about the future of Warwick, and the Midlands city in which it&apos;s based. &quot;People in the south misunderstand Coventry&apos;s pivotal location,&quot; he says. He envisages the university as a &quot;link between north and south, between the east and the west Midlands, between the centre of England and the whole of the UK, and between all those areas and a network of countries around the world&quot;. Thrift seems to harbour no nostalgic yearnings for the city of dreaming spires, having moved from a university with at least eight centuries of tradition behind it to one that has been around for all of four decades. &quot;There&apos;s not much difference in the time it takes to get to London, and the trains from Coventry are a lot better,&quot; he beams. &quot;Here, I feel that I&apos;m in an institution that wants to do things, with staff who are energised.&quot; When it comes to seeking partners for his proposed international quarter, he is looking for universities that have &quot;similar cultures&quot; to Warwick. &quot;Ambitious and bootstrapping&quot; is how he puts it. Bootstrapping? &quot;This university has pulled itself up by its bootstraps. There are plenty that started off at the same time as us, but Warwick forged ahead of them through an entrepreneurial spirit of structured risk-taking. I&apos;m very impressed by that.&quot; The university will need to expand substantially to accommodate its foreign visitors, but Thrift foresees little problem with acquiring planning permission. &quot;Our campus is partly on green-belt land. But it was given to us by the local authority with the intention that, one day, it would be more than just fields. What we&apos;re planning will not be intrusive or intensive.&quot; He has a vested interest in that, not just as a vice-chancellor but also as a resident. Thrift and his wife, Lynda, live on site in a former farmhouse that goes with the job. From it, they can walk to the biggest arts centre outside London, &quot;one of the jewels in Warwick&apos;s crown&quot;, he calls it, but in need of &quot;refreshing&quot;. Hence the proposed \u00a33.5m investment. The vice-chancellor&apos;s tastes in music include Richard Thompson and John Cale. He was a teenager in the 1960s. The son of teachers, he was born in Bath and went to grammar school in Nailsea, near Bristol. &quot;It became a comprehensive when I was in my second year,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Not that it made much difference to me.&quot; Young Thrift went on to do degrees in Aberystwyth and Bristol before rising through the ranks of academia to become an internationally acknowledged expert on cities. When rare opportunities arise, he loves to visit his daughters in Bath and New York. One city is noted for its elegance, the other for its dynamism. Coventry is noted for neither. It remains to be seen whether it can, once again, become a significant centre. And whether that can happen through its most successful university - the one that, rather confusingly, goes under the name of Warwick.

A second tsunami warning was issued when an aftershock measuring 6.6 hit the area three hours after the original quake. Most of the tsunami alerts were later lifted in the area. A worker at Indonesia&apos;s health ministry said at least two people had died, one of whom was hit by falling debris in Bengkulu, the town on Sumatra&apos;s west coast closest to the epicentre. People were reported to be trapped in collapsed buildings in the area. The quake also cut off phone lines and electricity supplies. Residents of Bengkulu said at least one building had been completely demolished and said the quake had caused panic about a possible tsunami. &quot;We think our neighbourhood is high enough. God willing, if the water comes, it will not touch us here,&quot; said Wati Said, a local woman. &quot;We are all afraid.&quot; The quake was powerful enough to be felt by people in high-rise buildings in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The December 26 2004 tsunami, which killed more than 220,000 people, was triggered by a 9.0 magnitude quake in the same region. Indonesia was the worst-affected nation. The Aceh region, on the northern tip of Sumatra island, was especially devastated, with more than 130,000 people killed. Indonesia, the world&apos;s largest archipelago, is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines encircling the Pacific basin."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/14/comment.television", "sentences": ["&quot;People came up to me going, &apos;Oi, mate, you look like Eric Clapton.&apos; I said, &apos;Rubbish.&apos; As we were coming back we stopped in Singapore and we were going through the airport and a woman came up to me going, &apos;Eric, Eric, can I have your autograph?&apos; And I said, &apos;Actually, I&apos;m not Eric Clapton,&apos; and she said, &apos;No, you&apos;re Eric Robson aren&apos;t you?", "They even get it wrong in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-14T06:27:22Z", "title": "Stephen Armstrong on local TV news", "tags": ["Media", "Television industry", "TV news", "Culture", "Television", "Michael Grade", "The news on TV", "Television & radio", "Regional TV news consortiums", "Local TV"], "article": "The 1980s was the decade when newsrooms around the world got slick. It became all about soundbite culture, the anchor&apos;s hairdo and the glib one-line pay off. &quot;My name&apos;s Tom Brokaw - goodnight,&quot; became the industry norm in the US. Meanwhile in Britain, Tyne Tees regional news presenter Paul Frost would wrap up his nightly bulletin Northern Life in a slightly less perfunctory manner. &quot;People always tease me about looking like Eric Clapton but I never believed them until we went to Aussie last week,&quot; he said at the end of one late-80s show. &quot;People came up to me going, &apos;Oi, mate, you look like Eric Clapton.&apos; I said, &apos;Rubbish.&apos; As we were coming back we stopped in Singapore and we were going through the airport and a woman came up to me going, &apos;Eric, Eric, can I have your autograph?&apos; And I said, &apos;Actually, I&apos;m not Eric Clapton,&apos; and she said, &apos;No, you&apos;re Eric Robson aren&apos;t you?

I&apos;ll see you again tomorrow night when we might get our sums right. Goodbye.&quot; This week, Michael Grade, the chairman of ITV, announced proposals to cut the network&apos;s 17 regional news services to nine - merging, for instance, Border and Tyne Tees, and ITV West and West Country. He said the commercial reality was that ITV was spending more on regional news than could be justified. The unions were angry, but most reporters chose to lead with the channel scrapping its late-night phone-in quizzes. And yet this phoneline scandal will be wrapping fish and chips tomorrow. But the scrapping of local news programmes? That&apos;s going to matter. ITV&apos;s regional news presenters have been creating British culture for the past 50 years. To cull them, in my opinion at least, would be like slaughtering bulldog puppies. For a start, they&apos;ve given us some of the best TV that anyone could ever dream up - TV that is truly beyond satire. Who else but an ITV regional anchor (in this case Bob Greaves at Granada) would have his testicles felt up, live on camera, by an elephant at Chester Zoo? Who else (in this case Calendar&apos;s Richard Whiteley) would be bitten by a ferret during the evening&apos;s main news programme? Who else (Judi Spiers this time) would have a giant rabbit called Gus Honeybun as a co-host, reading out birthday dedications to children from the area? And &quot;from the area&quot; is what it&apos;s all about. ITV news is local news for local people. Of course there&apos;s still the BBC. But the BBC&apos;s regional TV offerings - no matter how healthy the ratings - have always, by and large, seemed like a pat on the head for the yokels and a career stepping-stone for the likes of Emily Maitlis and Angela Rippon. ITV&apos;s news has been sincerely regional since it first began. Indeed, its mission statement - as found on its home page itv.com - reads: &quot;ITV has been the only truly regional television network in Britain since its creation in 1955.&quot; And what a glorious world &quot;truly regional&quot; proved to be, populated by eccentrics and oddballs, with folksy scripts and insane stories. It&apos;s only in an ITV regional newsroom that you will find Fred Dinenage, still presenting the Southampton edition of Meridian Tonight (alongside Debbie Thrower) after a 40-year career in television. He may have hosted the 1960s kids&apos; science show How, he may have appeared on Tiswas, he may have written the Krays&apos; autobiography and he may relax by playing keyboard in Fred Dinenage and the Sex Machines, but he was still prepared to give up smoking on air when this summer&apos;s ban came into effect, and he still judges sandcastle competitions on the Isle of Wight. The thing about local TV news is that it&apos;s not just local newspapers on the air (although local newspapers are doing very well in circulation terms, by the way, Mr Grade). Local TV news has always aimed high - sometimes too high - and without ITV regional news, today&apos;s popular culture would be entirely unrecognisable. For one thing, punk would never have happened. It was Bill Grundy, host of Thames Television&apos;s Today show, who gave the Sex Pistols the column inches they needed by encouraging them to swear on air - beginning the studio chat by saying &quot;they&apos;re as drunk as I am&quot;. Up in Manchester, Granada Reports anchor Tony Wilson (who died last month) went to see the Pistols at the Manchester Free Trade Hall, then went on to found Factory Records and the Hacienda nightclub - helping launch acid house and Britpop on the way. Wilson has long been credited as the inspiration for Steve Coogan&apos;s Alan Partridge, and Coogan played Wilson in the Factory movie 24 Hour Party People. He opened the film with a classic piece of Wilson reporting as he prepared to hang-glide on Granada Reports: &quot;Is is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it&apos;s the latest craze sweeping the Pennines, and I&apos;ve got to be honest, I&apos;d rather be sweeping the Pennines right now.&quot; There are those who say the place for eccentrics has gone, that local news these days is bland and too slick for its own good. It&apos;s certainly true that as ITV regional news began producing prime-time stars - the likes of Anne Diamond, and Richard and Judy - regional newsrooms became hotbeds of ambition. But to those cynics who say that all the character has gone from these shows, I offer up Wesley Smith, Kristina Moore and Kenny Toal. Smith began his career in 1987 working for Central News, and hosted the flagship show for so long he became known as Mr Central South. When the last round of news cuts - in 2006 -took his show, local outrage ensured he jumped to Thames Valley Tonight. Moore anchors the news on Channel Television, where she publicly fell out with former Radio 4 presenter and one-time co-anchor Patrick Muirhead. Muirhead then wrote a two-page feature for the Times describing her as &quot;fawning and sometimes wooden&quot;. He was appalled that viewers cared more for her pregnancy than for Jersey&apos;s \u00a3100m budget deficit. Indeed, Muirhead completely failed to understand the point of ITV regional news - people, and personalities, is really what it&apos;s all about. He has since opened a gentleman&apos;s clothing store in Midhurst, West Sussex. Toal, meanwhile, is a true Bob Greaves (he of the elephant) in the making. In August, he was gripped with stomach cramps just before going live as the main presenter on ITV North East Tonight. As the countdown began, the 34-year-old suddenly grabbed a bin, threw up and stuffed it under his desk before turning to face the camera. Other bins were whisked in and out of the studio as the programme continued, although Toal gave it all up during the sports section, leaving co-anchor Pam Royle to fill until the weather. He later blamed a poorly defrosted cheese pie - and claimed his place in local TV legend. Grade should take on the likes of Toal with care. Not only can this man face down violent vomiting attacks live on air, he presents in a region that has seen off this kind of threat before. Clapton-lookalike Paul Frost&apos;s Northern Life went off air after one of the first ITV regional news mergers - Yorkshire Television&apos;s takeover of Tyne Tees. The merged group became Channel 3 North East and Life became North East Tonight, hosted by an ex-BBC man, Mike Neville. Neville rose to the occasion: he would put paper bags on his head for rambling sign-offs with co-host Bob Johnson. But he knew in his heart that something was missing. The viewers would never be truly part of Channel 3 North East, no matter how popular his lovable antics became. Then, when Granada snapped up the company in 1997, it gave each station back its name and identity. On March 9 that year, Neville ended the evening news programme by telling viewers what was coming up that evening on Tyne Tees. &quot;Isn&apos;t it great to be able to say that name again?&quot; he said to Bob Johnson. Johnson&apos;s face broke into a huge, North Eastern grin \u00b7 Six writers celebrate their local TV news Yorkshire TV  Calendar, Yorkshire TV&apos;s nightly news report, was legendary in its heyday as a dollop of real Yorkshire excellence from Leeds. Its early presenters included two of the brightest stars of regional TV, who not only made their reputation at local level but enhanced them, in the eyes of Yorkshire people, by staying up here. The endlessly gabby Austin Mitchell was lost to parliament eventually, but Richard Whiteley stayed in Kirkstall Road and actually managed to colonise network programmes such as Countdown with his regional home-spinning. Even when shown upside down, or without sound, as occasionally happened, Calendar&apos;s half-hour gave good value and Marilyn Webb, the lads&apos; sidekick, could easily have toppled Selina Scott or Anna Ford. But she too preferred to stay up here. Since then, YTV has been taken over by Granada, Calendar has used outside presenters who can&apos;t pronounce &quot;Keighley&quot; and BBC Look North has cleaned up with the likes of Sophie Raworth and its current duo Christa Ackroyd and Harry Gration, whose joint middle name could be &quot;Regional&quot;. Which is what we like. Martin Wainwright Granada For a long time, it was unwritten law that local news must end with a humorous item presented by a buffoonish reporter. On Granada Reports, that reporter was Tony Wilson. Tony lent an insouciant flair to easing into charity vats of baked beans, or, as famously recreated in 24 Hour Party People, crashing a hang-glider. Unlike later knowing-wink-to-camera presenters, he seemed to take it seriously. Luckily, Richard Madeley, whose early-90s stint first catapulted him to Housewives&apos; Choice status, appeared to share the conviction that a dancing chihuahua mattered almost as much as a multi-car pile-up, and the programme was richer for it. Now, presenters Tony Morris and Lucy Meacock are slickly professional. Stories focus on tireless local fundraisers, bang-to-rights scam merchants, and the seething hotbed of north west politics. And while Tony and Lucy may allow themselves a wry smile as the credits approach, the final story is more likely to be on Coleen&apos;s latest perfume launch than pole-vaulting vicars. These days, Granada&apos;s all grown up - and sadly, humiliating reporters no longer counts as news. Flic Everett Scottish Television Back in the day when news bulletins weren&apos;t so fluffy, Scottish Television was way ahead of the curve. Over on the BBC, Mary Marquis, always in a judiciously arranged neckscarf, was gloriously imperious as she intoned of house fires in Fife, scandals in Strathclyde and robberies in Tobermory, but Scotland Today was, even back then, cheap and cheesy. And it had sports reports that went on interminably. It is a model to which the bulletin adheres to to this day - all snazzy sofas, chummy chats and Old Firm fandangos. It has had its share of glamour over the years, of course, from the Titian-haired Viv Lumsden and Kirsty Young, to Shireen Nanjiani (whose name, like that of her sportscaster colleague, Jim Delahunt, became rather rude rhyming slang on the streets of Glasgow). At times, such was the giddiness induced by imagining the behind-the-scenes soap opera, it almost didn&apos;t matter that, in front of the camera, it was as naff as the adverts that surrounded it. Scottish cheddar: it&apos;s our kind of cheese. Gareth McLean Anglia TV Boudicca would have been far more appropriate, but instead they plumped for a silver knight on horseback as the symbol for Anglia TV. For nearly 30 years, About Anglia, its flagship news programme, dished up a steady diet of Cromer crabs, war veterans and bypass openings, alongside coverage of seismic events such as the Royal Norfolk Show. But About Anglia&apos;s real treat was &quot;Patrick&apos;s Pantry&quot;, a cookery slot that launched Patrick Anthony as a celebrity to rival Delia Smith. The knight got the chop in 1988 - replaced by a dull flag - and soon About Anglia was axed and diced into two separate news programmes. These days, Anglia Tonight&apos;s presenters are younger, and you can catch it online and via podcasts, but About Anglia&apos;s legacy lives on: Judy Finnegan made her name as its first female reporter, showing off her newly born twins on the programme in 1977. Patrick Barkham ITV West If you like your news about shootings and stabbings in Bristol made more palatable by being presented from a picturesque location, then ITV West is the station for you. The team seems to like nothing better than taking the show out of the studio and on to the road. So you might be hearing about a murder in the inner city while in the background Bristol&apos;s air balloon fiesta is in full swing. Early evening news presenters Steve Scott and Lisa Aziz are old hands - he used to dodge bullets as ITN&apos;s Africa correspondent, she was a Sky anchor for 13 years - but both seem happy to have downsized to cosy old Bristol. And they were back on the frontline this summer when parts of Gloucestershire went missing under floodwater. A perfect local story - great pictures, exciting stories - and a chance to don their wellies. Steven Morris Ulster TV Ulster Television&apos;s Live at Six is the most watched regional news show in the UK, and the channel has launched the careers of the likes of Eamonn Holmes and Gloria Hunniford. Live at Six&apos;s news agenda has, inevitably, undergone a radical change over the past decade and a half. During 35 years of violence and instability the news team reported on daily acts of terrorism across Northern Ireland, Britain and beyond. Now the daily fare is dominated by property stories (the province has experienced the biggest property boom in the UK). Among its current crop of on-screen reporters is Ivan Little, who, off screen, is a well-known and respected thespian. The bearded Little has won praise for his stage performances, including his role in the highly popular comic take on the Northern Ireland conflict, A History of the Troubles by my Da.

When a man is serving 25 years for murder, you do not expect him to apologise for smoking a cigarette. &apos;Do you mind?&apos; he asks, fishing out a pristine packet of &apos;Red &amp; White&apos; from his shirt pocket. &apos;I gave up a year and four months ago but then I started again since all of this.&apos; He gestures vaguely with his hand, taking in his surroundings with a brief, unconcerned glance: the grubby prison visiting room, the grey-suited warders, the small metal cage he must be locked inside before being allowed to speak to anyone from the outside world. &apos;It is ridiculous what&apos;s going on here,&apos; he says, shaking his head. &apos;That I should be in jail just because someone drew the wrong conclusion from an innocent work of fiction.&apos; Balanced on the narrow ledge in front of him is a slim, black book, its pages carefully annotated in blue Biro, corners folded over to mark relevant passages. Its Polish title is typed on the cover in yellow print: &apos;Amok by Krystian Bala&apos;. As he talks, Bala bends back its spine and thumbs through the volume urgently, his eyes, framed by square wireless spectacles, skimming rapidly across the page. When he finds the phrase he is searching for, he slides it through a letterbox-sized slot cut into the metal bars. &apos;I can defend every single sentence,&apos; he says, jabbing at the typed pages with stubby fingers. As he gets more animated, his stilted conversational English breaks into the hiss and spit of quickfire Polish. This is the first time Bala has agreed to speak to a journalist since his incarceration - and he has plenty to say. &apos;Of course, the book is brutal, vulgar, the dirtiest I could write, but that&apos;s how art must be provocative. Just because I write a murder, doesn&apos;t mean I did it in real life.&apos; The Polish courts drew a different conclusion. On 5 September in a court in the Lower Silesian city of Wroclaw, Bala, 34, was found guilty of co-ordinating the torture, semi-starvation and eventual murder of his ex-wife&apos;s former lover. It was the most sensational trial in recent Polish history, its every detail pored over by the local press and recounted breathlessly to a stunned public. One of the main pieces of circumstantial evidence against Bala was his own book, in which an eerily similar murder was committed by the protagonist. According to the prosecution, Bala&apos;s narrative contained a level of detail about the actual killing of Darius Janiszewski that only the investigating police officers or the murderer could possibly have known. It was a peculiarly specific crime. The bloated, semi-naked body of Janiszewski, a 35-year-old advertising company director, was discovered by anglers on the banks of Wroclaw&apos;s River Odra on a washed-out, grey December morning in 2000. He had been missing for more than a month. The corpse bore livid bruises from repeated beatings and a series of knife wounds. Over the subsequent days, the police pathologist would find that Janiszewski had been denied food and water for three days before his death. The first police officers on the scene were struck by the strange way the victim had been tied up: his feet had been bound together, bent backwards and attached to a noose around his neck with a single piece of rope. Trussed up like a human&apos;s cat&apos;s cradle, Dariusz Janiszewski would have strangled himself had he flexed his legs too suddenly. No one knows whether he suffocated in this way before being thrown in the Odra or whether he drowned there. It was a brutal death, but it would have an even more gruesome coda. The first police investigation was abandoned in May 2001 after officers failed to find a single lead. Then, a year later, during a routine police review of unsolved cases, it was noticed that Janiszewski&apos;s mobile phone had never been recovered from the murder scene. The service provider traced his SIM card and, astonishingly, discovered that it was being used by an unsuspecting businessman who had bought the mobile from an internet auction site on 16 November 2000 - three days after Janiszewski&apos;s disappearance and several weeks before his body was found. The phone had been sold for 244 Polish zloty (about \u00a344) on the Allegro website by someone with the internet username &apos;ChrisB7&apos;. A cursory police search revealed that ChrisB7&apos;s account was registered to a Krystian Bala. That, in turn, led them to his weblog, a series of demented personal ramblings that would, three years later, be published as Amok. Amok did not sell particularly well when first published by Bala&apos;s friend, despite the enticing cover catch-line that it was intended &apos;for adults only&apos;. The few who read it were treated to a pulp-fiction orgy of bestiality, pornographic Oedipal complexes and indiscriminate sexual violence. But they might also have noted - as police officer Jacek Wroblewski did - the vivid description of the murder of a young woman called Mary, tied up in almost exactly the same way as Janiszewski, stabbed with a Japanese-made knife and left to die. The narrator - referred to throughout as Chris B - even sells the bloodied murder weapon on the internet auction site Allegro. It made unpleasant reading for Wroblewski, a mild-mannered and jovial 42-year-old with close-cropped brown hair and a generous paunch that spills over his jeans waistband. When he smiles, his whole face reddens. &apos;For me, it&apos;s not a book,&apos; he says, sitting in a small side-office at Wroclaw police headquarters, fishing out a Lipton teabag from a cup and placing it carefully on the saucer. &apos;It&apos;s hardcore pornography. It&apos;s very vulgar and it was hard for me to read it, but I knew I had to. There were specific elements which matched exactly the way the murder was carried out. And, more than that, there are pieces which show that Krystian Bala wrote this book as a kind of private diary.&apos; There were other slivers of evidence, too. When 997, the Polish equivalent of Crimewatch, aired a television special in 2003, appealing for information about the crime, the producers reported getting hits on their website from computers in Singapore, South Korea and Japan. The police discovered that Bala was visiting those countries on a scuba-diving trip on the relevant dates. Bala was arrested one mild evening in September 2005 as he walked to the chemist in shorts and T-shirt in his parents&apos; home town of Chojnow, southern Poland. Although he denied ever meeting the murder victim, a search of his bedroom revealed a stash of computer files containing information on Janiszewski and a pen bearing the logo of Janiszewski&apos;s advertising firm, Investor. A telephone card recovered in the search was later shown to have been used on the day of Janiszewski&apos;s disappearance to make calls to the victim&apos;s mother and his place of work. The same card had registered calls to Bala&apos;s family and friends. Further investigations revealed that Bala&apos;s ex-wife, Stanislawa, from whom he separated in 1999 and with whom he has a 10-year-old son, Kaspar, had been dating Janiszewski for a short period in the summer of 2000. Bala, a highly intelligent philosophy graduate with a seemingly unblemished past, now found himself accused of killing his ex-wife&apos;s boyfriend in a fit of jealous rage. &apos;Am I certain he is guilty?&apos; says Wroblewski. &apos;I am 100 per cent sure.&apos; Indeed, Bala himself spontaneously confessed to the murder in April 2006, but then refused to sign the statement, claiming he had been &apos;unwell&apos; at the time. But there remains none the less a substantial element of doubt concerning Bala&apos;s conviction. The evidence against him, however damning, was also entirely circumstantial. &apos;I don&apos;t deny that Krystian Bala had the victim&apos;s mobile phone in his possession but the prosecution failed to establish how he got it,&apos; says Bala&apos;s lawyer, Karol Weglinski. &apos;Having an object in one&apos;s possession is not the same as having killed the owner. A murder must be judged on evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt.&apos; The judge, Lidia Hojenska, further admitted that it was unlikely Bala had acted alone - Janiszewski was 6ft 3in and broadly built. Bala is barely 5 ft 7in and looks more like a postgraduate student than a criminal mastermind. In Wroclaw jail, a grim neo-Gothic building containing a jumbled maze of oak staircases and dingy, linoleum-lined corridors, the bespectacled Bala looks strangely out of place. He wears a navy corduroy shirt over a grey Harley Davidson T-shirt, and his jeans taper down to black rubber sandals. The tip of a big toe protrudes through a hole in his left sock. Bala has already been languishing in custody here for 20 months - under UK law, serious crime suspects can be detained for a maximum of 182 days. He has been kept in an 18-metre-square cell with up to seven other men, with one hour&apos;s outside exercise a day. &apos;I&apos;ve been spending my time getting grey hairs,&apos; he says. &apos;When I was a free man I didn&apos;t know one minute of boredom. Now I&apos;ve lost my life.&apos; He will remain in custody for the next two to three weeks while awaiting the outcome of his leave to appeal. This means that Bala continues to have freer access to books, clothes and family visits than regular inmates in the main prison. The difference suits him well. He likes to paint himself as a great dissident writer, an author whose work was deliberately intended to provoke conservative Polish society, and a philosopher whose thought processes are too advanced for the masses to understand. Talking to him is an exercise in frustration. He refuses to address the evidence stacked up against him, dismissing the case as a giant police conspiracy to dismantle his right to freedom of expression. He claims he found Janiszewski&apos;s mobile in a cafe and brushes aside inconvenient facts as &apos;lies&apos;. Through the course of our hour-long conversation, he compares himself variously to Ludwig Wittgenstein, Daniel Defoe, Philip Roth, Salman Rushdie, Henry Miller and William Burroughs. He likes to make facile puns - &apos;They call it the system; I call it the shitstem&apos; - delivering them with a half-smile, then repeating them to ensure the joke has registered. &apos;This book is obscene, vulgar, bawdy and pornographic,&apos; he says. &apos;But this book is about language and how it works. I am a stupidity exposer, a jester, a rebel, but the book is fictional, it is nothing to do with my life. &apos;What has happened to me is a horror story of the ignorance, arrogance and lack of professionalism in our public servants.&apos; In court, much was made of Bala&apos;s apparent superiority complex. Two independent psychologists found he had a high IQ and was mentally accountable for his actions but diagnosed a narcissistic emotional disorder that left him incapable of empathy, with an extreme hatred of criticism. &apos;Krystian Bala is not a fantasist; rather, he says something about himself that is a lie, but as soon as he says it, he starts to believe that it is true,&apos; says Wroblewski. According to Liliana Lukasiewicz, a lawyer who worked with the prosecution team, the only time Bala showed any emotion during the trial was when the judge said that he must be taken straight to his cell without being allowed to speak to waiting journalists. &apos;He was immediately very angry that he would not get the attention he craved,&apos; she says. Several character witnesses came forward to testify that Bala was an aggressive drunk and a borderline compulsive liar, prone to frequent outbursts of &apos;pathological jealousy&apos;. His three-year marriage to Stanislawa was punctuated by physical violence, to the extent that the Polish police placed the family on a domestic violence register called the &apos;Blue Card&apos; scheme. When the couple eventually separated in 1999, Bala became obsessed with tracking his wife&apos;s new partners, sending her abusive emails and text messages. At a New Year&apos;s Eve party the same year, Bala verbally threatened a barman he thought had been flirting with Stansilawa. Two witnesses heard Bala warn him off with the words: &apos;I&apos;ve already taken out a guy like you with a rope.&apos; What made Bala the man he became? He was born into a stable and loving family in the Upper Silesian city of Katowica, the elder of two children - his younger brother, Adrian, 26, is a computer programmer. When Bala was 15, the family moved to be closer to his extended family in his mother&apos;s home town of Chojnow, a small rural hamlet 100km outside Wroclaw. His boyhood home is a picturesque country villa, built by his construction worker father, Stanislaw, and reached by a short driveway that cuts through a garden filled with white wild flowers and peach trees. &apos;Krystian loved the plants and the wildlife,&apos; remembers his mother, Teresa. &apos;His father used to take him angling, and whenever he caught a fish he wouldn&apos;t want to kill it. He would say, &quot;You can have it if you want, but I want to set it free.&quot;&apos; Inside, the walls of the large, draughty rooms are crammed with family photographs. The sofa is piled high with an assortment of Krystian&apos;s certificates - a scuba-diving qualification, a masters diploma, a glowing reference from a university professor. &apos;I just want to show you something good about my son,&apos; says Teresa, a homely woman with a cheery smile and florid cheeks. &apos;Please understand me.&apos; The Balas are kind, hospitable people who insist on making me tea &apos;with milk - because it&apos;s English&apos;. A cut-glass bowl on the sitting-room table contains a pile of Jaffa Cakes. &apos;I am completely sure that my son is innocent,&apos; says Teresa, 53, a sales director at a farm equipment company. &apos;He was so sensitive as a child, so good. He loved animals. He had turtles, parrots, fish. He was able to read when he was five. He talked easily to people and made friends. &apos;He used to read all the time. He would fall asleep as a child with the book on his chest and his glasses slipping down his face. He is the best son I could wish for. He always used to remember Mother&apos;s Day.&apos; &apos;What we heard in court about him was so far-fetched,&apos; adds Stanislaw, 61, sitting impassively to one side, staring out of the window. &apos;I just couldn&apos;t understand it.&apos; It is clear that the Balas are by turns baffled and distraught by what has happened. They were so convinced that the court would release their son at the end of his trial that they had already prepared a &apos;Welcome Home&apos; banner. Teresa scurries upstairs, then brings down a sheet of cardboard on which they have drawn a felt-tip sketch of their house, surrounded by flowers and a large smiling sun. In the bottom right-hand corner is the date that they hoped Krystian would be released: 05.09.07. It is hard to ask them what they make of their son&apos;s first published novel, which features a lurid scene involving one character sleeping with his own mother. Teresa, though, has not read it, claiming she prefers &apos;romantic or historical fiction&apos;. Stanislaw has read it several times. &apos;It&apos;s not for children, but I find something new in it every time,&apos; he explains, loyally. &apos;The language is very vulgar but it is a provocation, and clever minds can understand it. &apos;I discussed the book with Krystian and asked him why he was writing it. He said, &quot;Father, you cannot understand what I wrote here because you haven&apos;t learned what I learned and that&apos;s why you cannot understand the deeper sense of it.&quot; He explains it to me now and I like to read it very much.&apos; Academically minded from a young age, Bala excelled at the local secondary school and was the first in the family to go to university, reading philosophy as an undergraduate at the University of Wroclaw and then staying on to do a masters. He was good-looking and popular with the girls - his friends nicknamed him Amora, the Polish equivalent of Casanova. But there was no serious girlfriend until he met Stanislawa in 1993, on one of his regular fishing trips. Stanislawa was two years older, a restaurant chef who had taught herself to cook after leaving school with no qualifications. She was also blond, pretty and liked to party. They got married in 1996. Krystian was 23. The wedding photographs show him with long curly hair down to his shoulders, looking like the quintessential student. &apos;They were not well matched,&apos; says Teresa. &apos;We were against them marrying so early, but they decided themselves. I think he had too much responsibility too young.&apos; A year later, the couple had a son. Krystian abandoned his university studies and set up a specialist cleaning company, but the marriage started to crumble. There were violent quarrels and accusations of infidelity on both sides. To this day, Stanislawa remains so terrified of her ex-husband that she refused to give her full address when she testified in court. When Krystian moved out of the couple&apos;s Wroclaw apartment in 1999, he hired a private detective to monitor his wife&apos;s movements. The discovery, shortly afterwards, that she was seeing Dariusz Janiszewski, a good-looking young advertising executive with an easy-going nature and a taste for Led Zeppelin, set in motion a disastrous chain of events. It would culminate in Janiszewski&apos;s brutal death and the bizarre retelling of his gruesome murder, three years later, in a thinly veiled work of fiction. Krystian Bala&apos;s own narrative has yet to reach its conclusion. He is preparing an appeal with his lawyer and plans to sue the police for damages. He is even working on his second novel, which he promises with some relish will be &apos;even more scandalous&apos; than the first. Does he feel any compassion for Janiszewski&apos;s family? &apos;It&apos;s a tragedy for them,&apos; he says. &apos;But I hope they want to find the truth. The people who did this have still not been found. There are answerless questions still.&apos; As he is unlocked from his metal cage by a prison warder and led back down the corridor, the soles of his sandals squeaking against the linoleum floor, he stops suddenly and turns round. &apos;Thumbs up!&apos; he shouts after me. I look back to see him grinning, one of his arms outstretched, his thumb pricked up like an over-excited tourist on a day-trip to Disneyland. It is a gesture so utterly misplaced, so strangely callous, that for all the disturbing police reports, the tales of remorseless violence and senseless death, it is this memory that will lodge in my mind for days afterwards: the sight of Krystian Bala, convicted murderer, doing the thumbs-up sign, a shard of light glinting off his spectacles and half-obscuring his smiling eyes."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/16/escape", "sentences": ["I know I can reach Beijing via the Trans-Siberian railway, and thence down through China towards Singapore.", "From Singapore, I&apos;m not sure how to proceed to Australia: cargo boats seem very expensive.", "To get to Australia without flying, your only realistic option is to travel by freighter from a large south-east Asian port, most commonly Singapore.", "This is neither cheap nor quick - the journey from Singapore to Brisbane or Sydney normally takes six to eight days and costs about \u00a385 a day."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-15T23:04:17Z", "title": "Ask Tom", "tags": ["Travel"], "article": "Now I&apos;m 60 I&apos;ve decided on a trip round the world. I&apos;ve booked a tour of New Zealand in mid-February 2008, and would like to travel mainly overland. I&apos;m giving myself around four months. I know I can reach Beijing via the Trans-Siberian railway, and thence down through China towards Singapore. From Singapore, I&apos;m not sure how to proceed to Australia: cargo boats seem very expensive. I&apos;d love to visit Uluru and the Olgas on my way, and want to see relatives in Melbourne before probably taking a flight to NZ.Margot Oakenby, Oxford I&apos;m asked this question more and more but the answer remains the same. To get to Australia without flying, your only realistic option is to travel by freighter from a large south-east Asian port, most commonly Singapore. This is neither cheap nor quick - the journey from Singapore to Brisbane or Sydney normally takes six to eight days and costs about \u00a385 a day. Cargo ship journeys can be arranged, with plenty of notice, through an agency such as the Cruise People (020 7723 2450; members.aol.com/CruiseAZ/home.htm). You will need to be flexible about departure dates and arrival cities. All voyages from south-east Asia to Australia offered by the Cruise People are fully booked until March 2008. Blogs such as tinyurl.com/ytf39l recommend Freighter Travel (freightertravel.co.nz) for arranging passage from Asia to Australia or New Zealand once you&apos;re on the road, but as this type of travel becomes more popular, you risk not getting a berth. To minimise flying I&apos;d suggest taking the Trans-Mongolian railway to China, eliminating a large proportion of air travel, then flying to Australia/New Zealand, and looking into freighters for some of the return journey, from the US to the UK for example. The Cruise People offer voyages from Richmond, Virginia or Chester, Pennsylvania to Liverpool, taking 12-14 days and costing from \u00a31205 for single occupancy of a double cabin. My passport is due for renewal in mid-2008. I am concerned about giving my biometric information so I need to know when the UK passport service will start processing renewals requiring this. Is there some sort of deadline before which I can renew on the existing &apos;old&apos; method?John Massemann, by email All new UK passports issued since October 2006 have included a biometric chip, so you are too late to renew for a new 10-year non-biometric passport. I suspect, however, that your question is driven by a desire to avoid carrying a document with excessive personal information on it. First-generation biometric &apos;e-passports&apos;, including UK ones, contain only the &apos;facial&apos; biometric. As part of the application process, facial features are scanned using a passport photo - this is to allow for automated recognition checks in the future. Apart from this, the data on the chip are exactly the same as on the personal data page on your passport. You can view this information at passport offices in Belfast, Glasgow, Durham, Liverpool, Peterborough, London and Newport, where there are public biometric passport-reading terminals.  Other EU countries will introduce a second-generation biometric passport, which will also include fingerprints, at some point in 2009. The UK intends to do this too, so as not to let the British passport become second-rate in terms of security features. A key factor of UK biometric passports is that they allow British nationals to travel visa-free to countries such as the US, which insist on visitors carrying biometric passports. However, you&apos;ll still be subjected to the fingerprints and photo procedures on entry. Go to passport.gov.uk/general_biometrics_passports.asp for an overview.  We are a group of four childless thirtysomethings (two couples) desperately hanging on to our youth. We are looking for a long weekend break in October in self-catering accommodation in a beautiful part of the UK. We originally thought of Scotland but have been disappointed by the cottages on websites. We are used to boutique hotels and want that luxury in self-catering. Matt Hawksworth, Oxford  These properties do exist, but you&apos;ve got to look hard for them. The South West England tourist board have set up a special &apos;luxury travel&apos; website - indulgesouthwest.co.uk - which lists lots of posh cottages from Cornwall to the Cotswolds. Alternatively, check out Higher Wiscombe in east Devon (higherwiscombe.com) and Well Cottage in Kent&apos;s North Downs (wellcottagekent.co.uk), both of which were commended by the 2007 Enjoy England Excellence Awards. Rural Retreats (ruralretreats.co.uk) has an impressive collection of high-spec properties throughout the UK (including Scotland). Lastly, Mr &amp; Mrs Smith (mrandmrssmith.com), the guidebook and website publisher which focuses on sexy boutique hotels, recently expanded their remit to include self-catering properties, all of which meet your big-white-towel requirements.

My son, who lived in Cuba for a few months, suggests we stay in a casa particular (private home) for at least a night to get more of a flavour of Cuban life. I&apos;m keen but my know-all son can&apos;t recommend a specific place and warns they open and close at alarming speed. Can you help? Jonna Eilers, Essex Your son is right: staying in a casa particular is a great way to broaden your view of Cuba. Casas particulares are heavily regulated by the government, with high operational taxes - some owners find the cost and effort are not worthwhile and so quickly shut up shop. However, many casas are well established, and this is particularly true in Habana Vieja, the old town. Do your homework first: compare traveller reviews and book online or by phone.

When he talks about what he&apos;s lived through as a simple, dedicated drummer, first for Joy Division, then for New Order, he can start to sound like a post-punk Victor Meldew, increasingly indignant at the chaos that unfolded all around him mainly because he found himself, through no real fault of his own, a Factory Records recording star. Don&apos;t get him started on the Hacienda, the Manchester nightclub his two groups helped finance, early in the Eighties, for up to \u00a310,000 a month, where he never got a free drink in eight years. He still hasn&apos;t really recovered from the time 27 years ago when Ian Curtis, his 23-year-old Macclesfield friend, and the singer in his band, killed himself the day before Joy Division were due to start their first American tour. Both his producer, Martin Hannett, and his manager, Rob Gretton, died in the Nineties, and now, would you credit it, the immortal-seeming Tony Wilson, boss of his record company, the crusading mouth of Manchester, has joined his comrades in the great Factory in the sky. Steve acts as if he has been singled out for the strangest kind of persecution. And the farcical pain doesn&apos;t stop. In 24 Hour Party People, a conceptual comedy in at least 100 parts directed by Michael Winterbottom, Morris, just a plain, hard-working northern drummer with a stupid fondness for a quiet life, had to suffer the indignity of seeing himself played by an actor. And now - bugger - it&apos;s happened again. Anton Corbijn, the singular Dutch photographer and video maker, has made Control, a film observing this fussed-over Manchester era more through the young life and sickening death of Ian Curtis than the unique tactlessness and tactics of Wilson. Manchester as hallucinatory urban bedlam is transformed into Manchester as exotically, dangerously mundane north European outpost seething with domestic, and cosmic, secrets. Steve will often tell you that he&apos;s not a bitter man, but surely no one should have to see their life story turned into a film not just once but twice. &apos;It just shouldn&apos;t happen,&apos; he grumbles, resigned to the fact no one is paying attention to him even as they keep turning his life into fact-based fiction. 002 The Leeds musician and actor Sam Riley found out that he got the role of Ian Curtis in Control on his 26th birthday. His acting career hadn&apos;t really taken off, just a couple of roles in minor TV shows and a small part as Mark E Smith in 24 Hour Party People that never made the finished cut, while his band, 10,000 Things, had just been dropped by their record label. As an actor he&apos;d been worried that the level of work he was being offered would interfere with his chances of being taken seriously as a musician. Now he didn&apos;t even have a music career. &apos;I always thought that it would really help if perhaps I got the lead in a really cool black and white movie where I talked all the way through.&apos; He&apos;d auditioned a few times for Control, preparing by watching rare early videos of Joy Division and listening to the coarser, punkier group they were before, Warsaw. Sometimes it seemed as if all anyone wanted to find out was his ability to do what he calls &apos;the thing&apos; - Curtis&apos;s explosive, implosive dance, an unholy combination of stasis and momentum, extreme mental pressure released through extravagant physical display. &apos;Can I see you move?&apos; Anton would murmur softly in a Dutch accent straight out of a bad porn movie. At one audition in Manchester a nervous Riley looked up and could see through the window of the audition room the red-faced, bug-eyed actor before him desperately attempting to recreate the dance. He raced downstairs to the toilets for some last-minute practice. &apos;Do I get music?&apos; Sam asked. An iPod was strapped to his arm, and off he would go, spurting around the room, Anton and company watching him flail away in silence. Anton, not quite satisfied, would get up and show him what to do with his feet. &apos;Lighter, lighter,&apos; he&apos;d implore, showing the way, two grown men, one of them well over six-foot tall, flapping around an empty room attempting to pin down Curtis&apos;s unconfined, seized-up dancing. 003 A naive, resourceful 24-year-old Anton Corbijn came to England in 1979 in part because of Joy Division, one of his favourite groups. He&apos;d been photographing Dutch musicians for a few years, but knew he needed to move into a bigger world. He left the small, timeless village in Holland where he was surrounded by a low level, austere and dramatically abstract landscape that would feature constantly in his photographs and videos. He found ways to set the musicians he photographed inside his own mysterious, playful imagination as formed by his isolated and isolating upbringing. The trees, grain and shadows in his work with U2, Captain Beefheart and Depeche Mode, found in deserts and locations far from his home, often resembled the view he would have from his home as a youngster. A friend once pointed out that in every single Corbijn video there is a tree. Often, there is also water and, in his photographs, an atmosphere that seems to change as you look at it. He came across the Channel in search of Joy Division, with no money, little English, and no contacts, and somehow this droll, intuitive and deep-thinking Dutchmen found them. 004 Peter Hook, Joy Division and then New Order bassist, is talking to me on the phone from his house after a weekend DJ session in Singapore. &apos;I played the original version of &apos;Love Will Tear Us Apart&apos; and also &apos;Transmission&apos; in a total dance club, and people were going absolutely crazy. What&apos;s that about?&apos; Hooky is the sentimentalist among the surviving members of the group, the one most blatantly proud of Joy Division&apos;s achievements, and the enduring life of the music, the one still stricken by Ian Curtis&apos;s suicide. Bernard Sumner, his old sparring partner in Joy Division and New Order, with whom he is currently in dispute regarding the future of New Order, is less likely to luxuriate in the past. &apos;When I saw the film in Cannes earlier this year, after Ian had died, &apos;Atmosphere&apos; is played, and it&apos;s bloody heartbreaking, it really is - it&apos;s like going through it all again, to be honest. Especially with all the problems with New Order. I&apos;m going through hell and people start to applaud! It&apos;s bizarre having your life flash back like that for other people to see. It&apos;s like when everyone laughed in 24 Hour Party People when we lost money on every copy sold of &apos;Blue Monday&apos; because of the expensive sleeve. I thought, &quot;You bastards - that&apos;s my life, that is, that really happened!&quot;&apos; 005 &apos;I grew up as the son of a Protestant minister so ill, dying people and death were never far from our dinner table talk,&apos; says Anton Corbijn. &apos;So it doesn&apos;t faze me as a subject. I think the things that matter in life and death, the beginning and the end, the essential things, are in my work a lot. I want my photographs to have a function. It&apos;s the Protestant thing, that everything you do has a reason, nothing throwaway. Even in my videos, even if they&apos;re funny, or bad, which happens, there are some fundamental things being told. I want that function to be showing someone in a way you have not seen them before. Make a photo that does not double up anything you have seen before. You create something that makes sense because it does not exist yet.&apos; 006 Anton and I talk in his large, immaculate office in Shepherds Bush in the summer of 2007. After being filmed 12 months before, after two years of tough, challenging pre-production, Control has been completed. People have started to see it, and it is being liked, even loved. Anton is extremely relieved. At times it looked as if there was no chance of it ever being made and becoming the graceful, inquisitive partner to the riotous 24 Hour Party People. At times, it seemed as though Anton was going to be defeated in his objective of being the first-time director wanting to film in black and white using a first-time director of photography and an unknown actor as the main lead. 007 Sam Riley is talking to me from Berlin days after winning a award at the Edinburgh Film Festival for his spectacularly convincing performance. He now lives in Berlin with Alexandra Maria Lara, the actress who in Control plays the quietly exotic Belgian journalist Annik Honore. The sensitive, impressionable Curtis fell in love with Annik while touring with Joy Division. His toiling young wife Debbie - played by Samantha Morton - looked after their new baby back in their tiny terrace in Macclesfield while this secret love bloomed and Ian&apos;s group became post-punk cult favourites. It&apos;s this story of a life breaking into two, into bits, of an anguished conscience expressed at the time so achingly in Joy Division&apos;s solitary official hit, &apos;Love Will Tear Us Apart&apos;, that Control eloquently and patiently monitors. It is more gently paced kitchen-sink art movie than sensationalising cut-up biopic - the conflict between the old working-class life Curtis was maniacally escaping and a new apparently liberating life as desired, damaged rock star, which led to mental and physical breakdown, and then suicide. &apos;It&apos;s like the Bible,&apos; says Corbijn. &apos;You know the end. He dies. So how you tell the story along the way is more important than ever.&apos; As Riley lived out the role in an intense 10-week period in the old Central TV studios in Nottingham last year, he admits that the reality of playing the young singer, trapped between family and a new love, careering towards suicide, had an effect on his own life. &apos;I think Ian went after fame and glory and, to an extent, he did it because he wanted to look after his wife and baby. Then he started resenting them because they were spoiling his new life, and then he hated himself for resenting them. He loved them and hated them in equal quantity. And Annik seemed his future. I got wrapped inside his problems. I found it very gruelling filming his epileptic fits. I found it tough knowing where it all led. It did cause me some major heartaches and depressions ... I don&apos;t want to talk about it too much, but I committed myself so much to this, not wanting to waste this chance, terrified that I wasn&apos;t going to be able to pull it off, that I would let everyone down, that I half morphed into what was going on within the film, and there was a kind of crash, and I had to pick up the pieces. I suppose you could say I was rescued by a German movie star. I moved to Berlin within two months of finishing the film. It&apos;s looked upon in the film world as a cliche, I know, even more so given the characters we were playing, but the movie reality broke into my reality. I guess it&apos;s the kind of thing that happens when you get close to this kind of story. It can change everything. It&apos;s complicated, but I couldn&apos;t be happier and Berlin is beautiful.&apos; 008 &apos;Sam just went for it,&apos; says Anton. &apos;He gave everything to the film. For a lot of known actors it is really scary to portray an icon because you can only disappoint. In his own life he had nothing to lose by taking all kinds of risks.&apos; 009 &apos;Can you believe that the film Ian went off with the film Annik?&apos; marvels Hooky. &apos;How hilarious is that? &apos;Talk about fact being stranger than fiction.&apos; 010 &apos;Within 40 days of arriving in England,&apos; Corbijn remembers, &apos;I had tracked down Joy Division&apos;s manager, Rob, and I met them at Lancaster Gate tube station. They were staying at a hotel nearby. That&apos;s where we did the first photographs. Being a well brought up, good young Dutchman, I wanted to shake their hands, but nobody would shake my hand. After we had done the photographs, they shook my hand. We didn&apos;t say much. I couldn&apos;t say much. Not only was my English really poor but I had trouble with accents. I could just about make out good English. The Manchester accent didn&apos;t make it easy. Also, I was in awe of them. It didn&apos;t make for much conversation.&apos; 011 The photographs Corbijn took that day, crossing the boundaries of language, silence and shyness, helped create the enduring image of Joy Division as serious, intensely introverted post-punk rock group as much as the conspicuously inscrutable artwork of Peter Saville did. The photographs weren&apos;t rock photographs but photographs of young northerners on some unspecified mission, and Saville&apos;s designs defiantly avoided all rock cliches in the unashamed pursuit of stark, stirring beauty. At the time, such solemnity and indifference to conventional rock ideas might have seemed precious and presumptuous; in the long run it consistently maintained an insulating layer of mystery that ensured the group never dated. The group may well have been four ordinary, mischievous young punk fans from grey, dingy Salford and disconcertingly quaint Macclesfield - with Manchester, their cultural playground, in the middle - but the contribution of Saville, and then Corbijn, alongside the way Martin Hannett transformed their violent live sound into compressed disquiet, helped present them as cryptic adventurers on a journey into awe-inspiring metaphysical darkness. These collaborators helped the group themselves believe, without being able to explain it apart from through their music, that they were more than just another group following up the influences of the Stooges and the Sex Pistols in the politically charged late 1970s. 012 As soon as Sam got the role, he asked if he could actually sing as Ian. Anton was initially adamant that you would hear no singing voice other than Ian&apos;s. Riley tried to coax his director into believing that he could pull it off. &apos;It seemed impossible,&apos; he admits. But once the actors playing the band got together they all started to learn the songs and quickly, encouraged by the fact the songs were powerful but never complex, mastered instruments they&apos;d rarely, if ever, played. James Pearson as Bernard Sumner, Harry Treadaway (Steven Morris) and Joe Anderson (Peter Hook), along with Riley, became a group, generating the unruly, insular &apos;us against the world&apos; attitude that the once real Joy Division had. The fact that the acting Joy Division play those early songs with as much edgy, scared and relentless commitment as the once upon a time real thing helps lift the film above being another sterile rock biopic mime show. Having the actors replay the urgent original group demonstrates how there were always two Joy Divisions - Joy Division&apos;s Joy Division, the one that played live with an unfettered metal fury, and Martin Hannett&apos;s Joy Division, a strategically processed studio intensification, and fragmentation, of the live entity. In the film, the bruising wildness of the live music helps make sense of the damned, psyched-out Curtis dance much more than Hannett&apos;s hallucinatory concentration, which attempted to make sense of Curtis&apos;s incredibly private thoughts. &apos;Up to a week before the film,&apos; says Corbijn, &apos;I thought they were going to play to playback. They ended up so good they played live as Joy Division. According to Bernard Sumner, Sam had exactly the same timbre as Ian. I can&apos;t think of it any other way now. That was a great gift from the actors. They wanted so badly to be a band and they behaved like a band. In the end, the only Joy Division music you hear played by Joy Division are the songs &apos;Love Will Tear Us Apart&apos; and &apos;Atmosphere&apos;. 013 One Anton Joy Division photograph in particular froze the group in time, but a time that was not necessarily 1979, or any known era - it was their own time, an otherworldly place their music seemed to slip and slither into and out of. Three members had their backs to the camera, their hands in their pockets, and were staring down a tunnel, at a distant light, at an entrance or exit. Ian Curtis, in long dark overcoat, having just remembered, or forgotten, something, had turned away from them, and was about to move in another direction, away from the light, towards what could be perceived as the unknown. It was a photograph that led you to believe how Ian, without saying much outside of his songs, in his own withdrawn, thoughtful and fundamentally disobedient way, was an artist and a star. It is such images that help fuel the continuing curiosity to find out what the hell happened. 014 &apos;It&apos;s one of the few conceptual photographs I took at that age. I had in mind the album title Unknown Pleasures, and I had this idea that if people walk away they walk towards unknown pleasures, and I just thought it would look good if one of them looked back. It wasn&apos;t planned. It&apos;s just the way it happened. It became very iconic in the end. It looked like premonition, but, to be honest, my English was so bad I didn&apos;t understand the severity of Ian&apos;s lyrics. I could feel it, but I didn&apos;t really understand. I suppose it created an image of the music using their bodies. Initially no one wanted to publish the photograph because only one guy was looking at the camera. The group liked it and used it on the cover of the special limited-edition [French label] Sordide Sentimental &apos;Atmosphere&apos;. Rob paid me \u00a325 and a copy of the single.&apos; 015 &apos;I&apos;m bound to say this as a musician and as one of the musicians involved,&apos; reflects Hooky, &apos;but I sometimes think that it&apos;s mainly because of the music that the story is still so much alive - that we did something so uniquely simple that&apos;s ended up so powerful and timeless. It reached into people&apos;s souls. It had such an impact on people&apos;s lives. Sure, there&apos;s the dead rock star thing, the myth, there&apos;s Factory, Tony Wilson, and the Hacienda, and Ian&apos;s death cemented it, but I don&apos;t think it would all still be so fascinating to people if it wasn&apos;t for the music. &apos; 016 &apos;I was terrified,&apos; admits Riley, remembering the time the Control Joy Division prepared to recreate an early bona fide Joy Division gig in front of 150 extras, most of whom were hardcore fans looking for a sign of weakness. &apos;I was terrified just of acting, especially with Samantha Morton as Debbie, just in case she wiped me out. But to actually have to be Ian on stage ...&apos; Riley had already made the mistake of checking a Joy Division chatboard for reactions to him playing the role. There was mostly consternation. After early reports of Jude Law and Cillian Murphy, this unknown failed musician from Leeds seemed a comedown. &apos;It was like, Who the fuck is Sam Riley? Still is, to some extent.&apos; Some fans even lobbied for the return of 24 Hour Party People&apos;s Ian Curtis, Sean Harris. &apos;I really felt the pressure then. One hundred and fifty extras all checking me out - &quot;so what makes you think you can be Ian?&quot; It was written all over them - &quot;it&apos;d better be fucking good then.&quot; I thought, They&apos;re seeing if I&apos;m too small, too tall, wrong face, if the hair&apos;s wrong, the clothes. Actually, they were just waiting to see The Thing. They just wanted to see me dance. Once, Anton admitted he had a panic attack about casting me. He would often make me come and dance for him, just to check it was all in order. It was like, the film would work if the dance was OK.&apos; 017 &apos;It was important to keep the film in black and white,&apos; says Anton, never totally convinced by colour as a way of explaining things. &apos;That&apos;s how I remember it. The north was so grey and Joy Division always seemed in black and white. Their record sleeves were in black and white, and the way they dressed was not colourful. I can&apos;t think of a group shot of Joy Division in colour. I have a theory that in those days before you had a hit you were only published in black and white magazines. Joy Division had never had a hit so they were never published in colour magazines! Your whole memory of Joy Division is through black and white photos, so the film just had to be in black and white. The opposition to this just made me more determined.&apos; 018 Another film that tells the Joy Division story, Grant Gee&apos;s big budget documentary, Joy Division, is being released almost simultaneously - and then there is Chris Rodley&apos;s Factory documentary that will go out on BBC4. I ask Hooky whether people will get sick of the obsession with Joy Division and Factory and Ian Curtis&apos;s suicide? &apos;Well, I&apos;ve lived with it every day for 30 years, and I&apos;m not sick of it.&apos; Is it just nostalgia, a sentimental retreading of a period that&apos;s over by those who cannot bear to see time slip away, a morbid cashing in? &apos;Bernard gets pissed off with me for being so sentimental, nostalgic and melancholy, but that&apos;s just the way I&apos;m built. For Bernard, it&apos;s over, let&apos;s get on with something else. But I think there&apos;s nothing wrong with looking back and seeing what happened, where you&apos;ve been, what difference that made to how things are now. If you leave everything behind, how can you tell whether anything special happened or not? If what you did is worthy of being history it can take being retold from different points of view.&apos; 019 Hooky compares the two film Ian Curtises that there have now been. &apos;I don&apos;t think either of them got Ian 100 per cent, but that might just be my version of Ian. But they were both fantastic. Sam caught Ian as a person, the way he spoke, the way he moved, little inflections, and he&apos;s certainly Ian as a good-looking young chap. Sometimes it sent shivers down my spine. That was more the Ian I remember being with, whereas Sean in 24 Hour Party People was perhaps the better stage Ian.&apos; 020 &apos;I was worried that I would take away the mystery, but in the end I also wanted to tell a simple story, and take the story to a wider audience who would be interested in the story at the heart of it, if not the music,&apos; says Corbijn. &apos;The cult audience knows this story. It seemed time to take it further, hopefully without ruining the secret. Making the film took the mystery away to an extent - when you are young you look up to a band whose music you love and think are half gods, and only later do you learn they were just normal lads who had a bit of chemistry.&apos; 021 &apos;When I saw it at Cannes,&apos; says Hooky, &apos;I knew that it was a great film and that it would be very well received because even though it&apos;s two hours long, only two people went to the toilet the whole time. In fact, one of them was Bernard. The other one was a 70-year-old woman.&apos; 022 In 2004, Corbijn worked on an epic book of U2 photographs, which involved looking at contact sheets from the early Eighties. &apos;It went beyond being a technical project, and I started to feel just like I did back then. Having no money, waiting for a bus, looking for somewhere to live, you&apos;re in a foreign country, unsettled, working as hard as you can to do good work, and many of those feelings were linked to Joy Division. I realised the film could be a personal project, the fact that my motivation to go to England was Joy Division. It was looking at a part of my own life as much as it was just telling the story of Joy Division. It meant so much to my life. It justified making the film for me.&apos; Within three days of agreeing to make the film, in 2005, he was sat, unprepared and a little bewildered, at a press conference in Manchester alongside co-producer Tony Wilson and another producer, Todd Eckert. On the way to the conference, Anton thought of the title. At the conference, it was, naturally, self-publicist Wilson who did most of the talking. Wilson never got to see the finished film, his death in early August drawing attention in the most emphatic way to how this film, as a delicate by-product of the agitating cultural commotion he helped orchestrate, is about the fierce strangeness of disappearance as much as the fearsome and astonishing miracle of appearance. 023 Wilson swoops onto set one day with his dog, one of those large, floppy William Wegman Wiemaraner dogs from a New Order video. He has no intention of getting involved, of interfering with Anton&apos;s plans, and simply works the room, like a professionally interested royal visitor, greeting the crew, joking about the clothes, checking on the odd detail, geeing everyone up, happy to see the story told through Ian. His dog runs amok, causing chaos, shitting all over the wires, bumping into scenery. Wilson keeps grinning at everyone as if the trouble the dog is causing is absolutely nothing to do with him. 024 &apos;When I was at Tony&apos;s funeral in August,&apos; Hooky recalls, &apos;I came out of the cathedral with Natalie, Ian&apos;s daughter, and they were playing &quot;Atmosphere&quot;. Bloody hell, I said, sometimes I wished that I&apos;d never written it - it&apos;s like Robbie Williams&apos; &quot;Angels&quot; is for weddings, and &quot;Atmosphere&quot; is for funerals.&apos; 025 Corbijn was finally making his first movie, but it soon became clear that no one really wanted it - or no one really wanted it the way that he wanted to do it, just following his instincts. Potential financing quickly fell away, with those prepared to give money demanding things that would have made the film exactly the conventional, crude American style biopic Corbijn was determined to avoid. Corbijn, stubbornly, kept it alive. He took on the role of producer as well, determined now to make a movie not directly of Debbie Curtis&apos;s book, but a distinctive northern story set in the 1970s based around various memories of Ian&apos;s life in the few years between his late teens and his death. The soundtrack would just happen to include Bowie, the Stooges, Velvet Underground and Joy Division. Corbijn ultimately financed the film himself with a couple of friends and streamlined Matt Greenhalgh&apos;s light, functional script. As the filming start date was postponed from the winter of 2005/2006, to March, to May, to July, a battered, distracted Anton was sure that this was the only film he would ever make. He was dealing with budget problems, with a lack of distribution offers, with the egos and sensitivities of the living characters he was portraying, trying to keep both Ian&apos;s wife and his lover happy with their portrayals, dealing with the tricky, picky New Order as they wrote the soundtrack, running across all the grudges that still exist within the formal and informal families 27 years after the fact. &apos;When it is your first movie you are ignorant of the problems ahead, thank God. I quickly learnt about the amount of things that can go wrong with a movie and the way it can disappear in front of your eyes. I was prepared to lose my money. It is amazing that it didn&apos;t happen. If you want to take a photograph, you can just take it. Here, to make the movie I wanted to make, it looked as though I would have to sell my home.&apos; 026 I visit Anton on set in Nottingham in August 2006. It&apos;s a hot sunny day. &apos;I thought it would be very cloudy and grey and, of course, it&apos;s been the sunniest summer for years. We got one great cloud, above the crematorium when we filmed there. He&apos;s at his calmest despite the pressure and the fact there&apos;s still no one prepared to distribute the film. I watch him carefully piece together the chaos of Curtis&apos;s last days, on the road, in the studio, at home, homeless, in love, out of love, lonely, surrounded by, and increasingly separate from, friends and family, sure of the way he wants to tell the story, relieved that there was no one demanding more pace, more sensation, more madness. In the studio, Bernard&apos;s little house where Curtis fled after being kicked out of home sat next to Wilson&apos;s front room just across from Hannett&apos;s recording studio. You can stroll in a few seconds from Macclesfield to Stockport to Salford. A hushed, stunned Ian and Bernard discuss Ian&apos;s mounting personal problems and then, minutes later, sonic enthusiast Hannett organises the backing track for &apos;She&apos;s Lost Control&apos;. A distant, disappearing Manchester, a fluid, contradictory set of memories, a brood of heroes and villains, Ian at the centre with, in this case, the other characters all supporting his story, symbolically fading behind his evaporating intensity - it was all being fed through Anton&apos;s decision to make the story both as real as possible and subtly disorientating. A film Manchester is made up, approximately resembling a lost Manchester. It takes an outsider&apos;s eye to tell this very British, very lonely story. Corbijn was able to make it because, now a renowned photographer and video maker, he directed the film with an innocence that echoed the innocence with which he took that first photograph of Joy Division. It broke all the rules, but he didn&apos;t know those rules even existed, and even when he found out they did, he refused to follow them. 027 The film is shown to a standing ovation at Cannes in May. After the showing Sam visits the toilet and finds himself standing next to Peter Hook. Joe, who played him, was making a film in Hollywood. &apos;I said: &quot;What do you think, Hooky?&quot; He said: &quot;Well, if you&apos;d played me, you&apos;d be in Hollywood now.&quot; No slap on the back, but a basic Manc gag. That&apos;s good enough for me.&apos; 028 Anton calls me from Belgium at the end of August. He&apos;s in one of his more sentimental moods. &apos;It was 35 years ago yesterday that I took my first photograph - a local Dutch group called Solution.&apos; He&apos;s just done the Belgian equivalent of Friday Night With Jonathan Ross, gamely selling this fatal love story to as wide an audience as possible. He&apos;s looking at the poster for the film. &apos;It&apos;s like a combination of Scarface and Godard.&apos; He&apos;s sold the film in America - to notorious indie monster Harvey Weinstein, which is deeply Wilsonian. &apos;Harvey called me, said: &quot;I loved your film, don&apos;t change a thing, and don&apos;t believe what you read about me. Classic stuff.&quot; We&apos;ll see ...&apos; I tell him Sam says he wants to work on whatever film he&apos;s going to do next. &apos;Sam and I were the virgins on this film and we depended on each other to get through it.&apos; So there will now be another film? &apos;Oh yes. It will probably be a thriller. Not music. Something very different. Definitely in colour.&apos; Joy Division: the fac(t)s After previous incarnations as Stiff Kittens and Warsaw, Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Steven Morris played their debut gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978. Debut album Unknown Pleasures, released on 15 June 1979, was hailed by rock writer Jon Savage as an &apos;opaque manifesto&apos;. Ian Curtis committed suicide on 18 May 1980, two months before second album Closer was released. The three remaining members, along with Morris&apos;s girlfriend Gillian Gilbert, became New Order. \u00b7 Control is released on 5 October; Joy Division recently premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. Factory is scheduled to be shown on 21 September on BBC4.

In fact, the words &quot;banking&quot; and &quot;panic&quot; have been linked for just about as long as financial institutions have existed. No less an authority than the top US investment bank Lehman Brothers, for example, blames the start of the western world&apos;s first identifiably financial crash and subsequent bank run on the moment when some incompetent and unimaginative corporate bean-counter in the accounts department of the Holy Roman Empire decided it would be a fun idea to debase its coinage. And that was in 1622. Then there was Holland&apos;s 1637 tulip bubble, during which a single tulip bulb could briefly fetch six times the average wage or, if you were very lucky, a six-bedroomed piece of prime real estate beside one of Amsterdam&apos;s premier canals (one particularly precious speciemen, the Semper Augustus, was apparently once sold for 6,000 Dutch florins at a time when a tonne of butter cost 100). You would have thought, too, that Britain&apos;s South Sea Bubble of 1720 might have taught us all a few lessons about exaggerated claims of future returns and fevered, easy-money speculation, but of course no: after losing a terrifying \u00a320,000 on the venture, even Sir Isaac Newton was induced to observe that he could &quot;calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men&quot;. Again, according to Lehman Brothers, the 18th century saw 11 banking and financial crashes and the 19th another 18, including American banking crises in (to keep things brief) 1819, 1837, 1847, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1890 and 1896. There were a healthy 33 such storms in the 20th century, chief among them the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Japanese financial turmoil of the 1990s. All, to varying degrees, have caused considerable distress to investors and savers large and small. Stuffing the lot under your mattress may not be such a crazy notion after all. Victorian banking crisis By the late 19th century, the City of London and its banks - huge, hierarchical, top-heavy, complacent - seemed all but unassailable. But they were not. In 1866, for example, the bill broker and discount banker Overend, Gurney &amp; Co collapsed with debts of \u00a311m, a breathtaking sum at the time. The company&apos;s directors were promptly tried for fraud, but not before they had triggered a financial crisis that saw some 200 other companies, including many smaller banks, go out of business. In 1878, the City of Glasgow Bank also collapsed, its \u00a35.2m &quot;deficiency of capital&quot; reportedly ruining all but 254 of its 1,819 shareholders. These misadventures did, however, have the beneficial effect of prompting our nation&apos;s leading financial institutions to behave with a shade more financial responsibility, notably by doing their accounts, underpinned by the establishment of the Bank of England as a lender of last resort. The panic of 1907 This was a big American crisis during which the stock market lost half its value, the economy fell into recession, banks and trust companies suffered countless and catastrophic runs and the National Bank of North America collapsed. It was sparked, apparently, by a decision by a few New York banks to retract loans but soon spread nationwide and eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System, America&apos;s central bank, in 1913. For a number of reasons we do not pretend to understand, it appears that a key player in the crisis was a Mr F Augustus Heinze and his splendidly named Knickerbocker Trust Company, whose dodgy dealings in the financial and commodities markets helped precipitate a stock market crash. The end of the American economy as we know it was, however, averted by one JP Morgan, who sorted the problem out by organising money transfers between the banks, setting up international credit lines, and buying up cheap shares in fundamentally healthy outfits. He did quite well out of it. The Wall Street crash The grandaddy of all modern financial disasters began with a frantic flurry of selling (more than 12m shares) on Black Thursday, October 24 1929. Trading slowed somewhat over the next few days, but a sudden slump in share prices gave it second wind, and on October 29, Black Tuesday, the world&apos;s foremost capital market crashed, with investors selling a total of 16,410,030 shares, a number not exceeded until 30 years later. Some $14bn was wiped off the value of the New York Stock Exchange in the first day alone, obliging unhappy NYSE clerks to work until 5am the next morning to record all the transactions. By 1933, some 11,000 of America&apos;s 25,000 banks had gone bust (although most of the big boys, the Morgans and Rockefellers and Lehmans, survived) and millions of investors were ruined, 11 of them famously jumping from upper-floor windows of Wall Street as the scale of the catastrophe - and of their own losses - became apparent. This was a crash so enormous, so profound, that it marked the end of one era and the start of another; the Roaring Twenties came to a close, the Black Thirties began. Over the next few years, America&apos;s jobless total climbed to 13m and millions lost their homes in the Great Depression. Stock prices were still 75% below their 1929 peak as late as April 1942, and it took the market as a whole a quarter of a century to recover. The Wall Street crash, you may not be surprised to learn, followed a decade-long speculative boom during which millions of investors piled into the stock market and borrowed to buy more. Rising share prices prompted more and more people to invest and more and more banks to lend more and more, creating a classic economic bubble. By the time the end came, brokers would lend you as much as 60% of the face value of the shares you wanted to buy. To those with a little knowledge of economics, this may sound alarmingly familiar. Also familiar may be the fact that the American president of the day declared it would be inappropriate to intervene. BCCI Banking collapses don&apos;t come much bigger than that of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, closed down by the Bank of England in July 1991 after regulators found it was up to its neck in such worthy activities as fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, arms trafficking, smuggling, unlawful property dealing, bribery and the support of terrorism. Around a million investors in more than 70 countries, including Crown jeweller&apos;s Garrard&apos;s, got burned as BCCI, which was founded in Pakistan in 1972 and once claimed assets of $25bn, was shown to have mislaid a cool $13bn. Money from Abu Dhabi, the Bank of America and possibly the CIA went into setting up the bank, which expanded at what can only be called suspicious speed throughout the 1970s, growing from 19 branches and $200m of assets in 1973 to 150 branches and $4bn in 1980. Despite this apparent success, the financial journalist Dan Atkinson later reckoned that the bank was most probably spending its customers&apos; deposits rather than investing them - in other words, was technically insolvent - as early as 1977. Reports of serious problems, however, did not really start to emerge until the late 1980s, and it was not until March 1991 that the Bank of England commissioned accountants PriceWaterhouse to carry out a full inquiry. This found, with splendidly British understatement, that BCCI had been guilty of &quot;widespread fraud and manipulation&quot;. A 1992 US report went further, concluding that BCCI was &quot;not an ordinary bank. It was set up deliberately to avoid centralised regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs are extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection.&quot; Creditors claimed that the Bank of England had left &quot;an untamed monster on the loose&quot; for way too long and sued it for \u00a3850m; the case eventually collapsed with both sides having racked up legal fees of more than \u00a3100m. The collapse of BCCI is widely seen as one of the world&apos;s greatest financial scandals. Nor, it has to be said, was it one of the finest chapters in the history of our financial watchdogs. Barings Bank BCCI was big; Baring&apos;s was old. It was, in fact, the oldest merchant bank in the City until it went spectacularly belly-up in 1995, following losses of some \u00a3827m by one of its traders, the now-legendary Nick Leeson, on futures contracts. Baring&apos;s was so old (it was founded in 1762) and grand that despite Britain being at war with France, it had helped to finance the Louisiana Purchase, by which the United States bought nearly a quarter of its current territory from the French in 1803. It was also old enough to have been in trouble before, needing to be rescued by the Bank of England in 1890 from a spot of over-exposure to bad Argentine and Uruguayan debt. Neither its illustrious history nor its many high-level connections with, for example, the British royal family could save it, however, when &quot;rogue trader&quot; Leeson let rip in the bank&apos;s Singapore offices between 1992 and 1995. In charge of both the bank&apos;s trading operations on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and of the proper and accurate accounting of those trades, Leeson effectively reported to himself and was therefore able to conceal his shortfalls on the futures market by simply reporting losses as profits. With the help of account number 88888, the hidden so-called &quot;five-eights account&quot;, the trader successfully concealed his mounting losses from head office in London until the Kobe earthquake precipitated a slump in Asian financial markets. A Bank of England bailout failed and Barings was formally declared insolvent on February 26 1995, whereupon it was snapped up by Dutch banking and insurance giant ING - for a quid. US savings and loans crisis Savings and loans institutions in the United States were essentially small local banks that made home loans and took deposits from savers. Dating back in many instances to the 1800s, they were comparable in many ways to Britain&apos;s building societies. In the 1970s and 80s, however, financial deregulation encouraged S&amp;Ls to venture into far choppier financial waters, offering unfeasibly complex products and lending imprudently large sums in direct competition with the major US commercial banks - but without the banks&apos; expertise, and outside the banks&apos; strict regulatory framework. Predictably, large numbers of them found themselves in deep trouble, and a run began first of all on S&amp;L institutions in Ohio and Maryland in 1985. Some 1,000 of America&apos;s 4,000-plus S&amp;L&apos;s would eventually go belly-up in what one US economic professor later called &quot;the largest and costliest venture in public misfeasance, malfeasance and larceny of all time&quot;. And since the federal government had insured many of the individual deposits in the S&amp;Ls, it found itself facing a mammoth liability when they collapsed: the total cost of the bailout came to $150bn. Another regulatory triumph! Argentinian banking crisis On April 19 2002, in a desperate attempt to prevent the collapse of the economy, the Argentine government was forced to order the indefinite closure of all of the country&apos;s banks. Falling GDP, high government spending, rampant corruption, endemic tax evasion, rising unemployment and soaring public debt had finally put the wind up savers. They had lost all confidence in the country&apos;s economy and begun besieging their banks to withdraw their pesos, convert them into dollars and invest them abroad. In a move that went down very badly with an already unhappy populace, all banking and foreign exchange transactions were halted. This was even tougher than the restriction introduced a few months earlier that had prevented them from withdrawing more than the equivalent of $500 a month of their own money (in fact, being a resourceful people, many Argentinians had managed to obtain court rulings overturning that particular law, successfully taking out more than $100m a day. By the time the full freeze was ordered, experts estimated the Argentine banking system had been bled of more than 10% of its cash). At one stage security staff in the Buenos Aires headquarters of HSBC opened fire on the protesters. The Dawes, Tomes, Mousely, Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank In the fine musical Mary Poppins, Mr Dawes, the elderly banker who employs the children&apos;s father, optimistically attempts to persuade young Michael to put his money in the bank on the grounds that &quot;If you invest your tuppence/Wisely in the bank/ Safe and sound/ Soon that tuppence/ Will compound.&quot; Not only will the lad get a slice of the action in &quot;railways through Africa, dams across the Nile, majestic self- amortising canals and plantations of ripening tea&quot;, promises Mr Dawes, but he will &quot;achieve that sense of stature/ as your influence expands/ To the high financial strata/ that established credit now commands&quot;. Michael, understandably reluctant to entrust his precious tuppence-worth of pocket money to a baritone banker with full backing orchestra, protests, prompting the other customers in the bank to take fright and frantically begin withdrawing their lives&apos; savings. This in turn forces the Dawes, Tomes, Mousely, Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank to temporarily suspend trading. The children&apos;s unfortunate father, who - perhaps tellingly - is called Mr Banks, faces disciplinary action and is eventually fired for triggering the first run on the bank since 1773. The enduring popularity of this film might be seen as evidence of a popular lack of confidence in the banking system."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/19/gambling.davidbatty", "sentences": ["The rate of problem gambling in Britain is higher than in Norway; similar to that of Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland; but lower than in Australia, South Africa, the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the commission says."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-19T15:21:14Z", "title": "Study shows 250,000 problem gamblers in UK", "tags": ["UK news", "Gambling"], "article": "There are more than 250,000 problem gamblers in Britain, according to research published today. The figure represents around 0.6% of the adult population, the same proportion identified in the last major gambling study eight years ago. The Gambling Commission report found that around 32 million people - 68% of adults - took part in some form of gambling in the past year. This compared with 33 million people - 72% of adults - in the 1999 survey. The fall was largely due to fewer people buying National Lottery tickets. Although the lottery remains the most popular gambling activity, the proportion of people taking part has fallen from 65% in 1999 to 57% this year. The other most popular gambling activities were scratchcards, bought by 20% of adults, betting on horse races (17%), and playing slot machines (14%). Other gambling included playing bingo (7%), internet gambling (6%), betting on dog races (5%), betting in a casino (4%), and using fixed-odds betting terminals (3%). The Gambling Commission chairman, Peter Dean, said: &quot;The key message is that overall there has been surprisingly little change either in the number of gambling participants or to the number of problem gamblers since 1999. &quot;We remain concerned that there are still over a quarter of a million adults who are problem gamblers.&quot; One of the report&apos;s authors, Mark Griffiths, professor of gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University, warned that the number of problem gamblers could still rise due to the Gambling Act 2005, which came into effect this month. The legislation gives casinos and online-gambling sites greater freedom to advertise, which Prof Griffiths said would &quot;stimulate people to gamble&quot;. The static level of problem gambling appears at odds with the number of calls taken by the charity GamCare, which helps individuals in difficulty from gambling or their friends and relatives. GamCare registered more than 30,000 calls to its helpline last year, a rise of 33.9% on 2005. The charity predicts it will take 40,000 calls this year. Anthony Jennens, the GamCare chairman, said: &quot;All surveys are more or less accurate but to suggest that this captures everyone is ridiculous. Many are gambling on overseas websites, so I&apos;m not sure how you&apos;d assess their numbers.&quot; Gambling is seen as problematic when it is harmful to a person&apos;s family or personal life. Symptoms include chasing losses, using gambling as a form of escapism, and being unable to cut back on the amount of gambling. The rate of problem gambling in Britain is higher than in Norway; similar to that of Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland; but lower than in Australia, South Africa, the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the commission says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/19/green.travelwebsites", "sentences": ["Hostel One66, Singapore &quot;The unusual Hostel One66, located in a residential area of Singapore, is known locally as the rag and bone hostel - due to its bizarre range of recycled furniture, which includes seats made from old jerry cans and mini-lockers crafted from plastic piping."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-19T16:32:54Z", "title": "Benji Lanyado's top tips for green travel \u2014 from the green travel blogs", "tags": ["Travel", "Green travel", "Travel websites", "Hotels", "Spain holidays", "Mexico holidays", "Cornwall holidays", "Singapore holidays", "Costa Rica holidays"], "article": "1.

But new, more commercial, more complex and stealthier types of malware have people in the industry asking: will antivirus software be effective for much longer? Among the threats they see are malware that uses the ability of the latest processors to run virtual machines that would be hidden from antivirus programs. Antivirus vendors, though, don&apos;t seem to think they have a problem. &quot;Probably every year people say antivirus software is dead,&quot; says Eric Chen, a research manager at Symantec. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at rival antivirus vendor Sophos, says: &quot;We do, from time to time, see new ways of infecting computers ... But the way all those things actually would arrive at a computer would be through conventional methods.&quot; That is, no matter how a new piece of malicious code spreads or what it&apos;s going to try to do, it will still arrive at your machine as a piece of executable code that security software can detect before it does any damage. Changing threats Besides, says Cluley: &quot;Some parts of the software community may underestimate what antivirus software is these days. It&apos;s the same name, but we&apos;re not doing it the way we did it 20 years ago.&quot; For one thing, he says - and Chen says the same - today&apos;s AV software relies far less on virus signatures - code unique to each bit of malware - to detect an intrusion than many people suppose, and is constantly evolving. A year ago AV software couldn&apos;t handle rootkits (programs that hide themselves and take control of the computer); now almost every product can. Much good it does us. Pedro Bustamante, chief marketing officer for Spanish-based Panda Security, recently completed a survey of 1.5m consumer PCs and 17,809 computers in 1,206 company networks looking for all types of malware. Of the consumer PCs, only 37% had fully updated security protection - and of those, nearly a quarter were still infected. That&apos;s only 8.5% - but equates to 127,650 machines in the 1.5m sample. Of the corporate networks, 72% were infected. Threats have also become more transient: viruses attack for a couple of weeks and then are never seen again.  Sophos and Symantec use heuristics to look for common behavioural patterns. And AV software is moving from blacklisting (barring bad stuff) to whitelisting (allowing only known good stuff).  Meanwhile, rather than email, the fastest-growing threat is so-called drive-by attacks - malware downloaded automatically when you visit an infected website. Unlike email threats, you can&apos;t avoid this by using common sense and avoiding dodgy sites; Cluley says Sophos is seeing 29,000 new infected web pages a day, and 80% of these are not &quot;dangerous areas&quot;. Instead, they&apos;re legitimate sites on anything from pottery to the Miami Dolphins and the Bank of India. The statistics on older types of malware alone are scary. Seven years ago, says Bustamante, there were maybe 100,000 to 300,000 viruses; now there are &quot;millions and millions&quot;. And those use new techniques: 90% constantly modify their shells so their signature is never the same. Even more important, malware writers have changed from amateurs who want bragging rights to a full-blown criminal - and commercial - market. The chains of events leading to attacks can involve as many as six or seven different players: one hacks the website, another writes the exploit toolkit, a third writes the botnet and rents it out at 4\u00a2 per PC, and so on. If you know where to go, you can buy a one-day distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack for $100 (\u00a350), send 10m spam emails for $600, send 1m spam IMs for $150, or pick up 50Mb of stolen bank and credit card accounts for as little as $30.  Today&apos;s malware is different, too: flamboyance has been replaced by stealth. The longer your virus can go undetected on a user&apos;s system the longer it can go on stealing money, bank accounts and credit card details. Today&apos;s malware writers want maximum effectiveness and a minimum of detection. Macs and Linux systems remain relatively untroubled because if you&apos;re after money, you go where the most users are. And that&apos;s Windows. What lies beneath Peter Gutmann, a researcher at the University of Auckland who presented the results of a study of the commercial market for malware at August&apos;s Defcon, estimates that a good virus programmer can make as much as $200,000 a year (here, a 660KB PDF). Alan Cox, an open-source security researcher, points out some additional possibilities. One is malware designed to sit under today&apos;s virtual machines. A proof-of-concept paper proposing such an attack, called Subvirt (PDF), appeared last year, written by three researchers from Microsoft and two from the University of Michigan. A presentation at last year&apos;s Black Hat security conference from Joanna Rutkowska, a researcher at Coseinc, a Singapore-based security company, covered a much leaner attack she called Blue Pill, which targets the virtualisation built into Windows Vista and into current processors from both AMD and Intel.  So far, these attacks are only theoretical. But, says Gerhard Eschelbeck, chief technology officer at the security company Webroot: &quot;Probably by next year&apos;s Black Hat [in early August] we&apos;ll see malware leveraging virtual machine techniques in the real world.&quot; Meanwhile the proliferation of short-lived viruses - Cluley says Sophos is seeing 9,000 new pieces of malware a month, or 300 per day - has forced Webroot to change how it works. No longer can it wait for customers to report a new virus. Instead, says Eschelbeck: &quot;We have to hunt for malware on the internet as researchers.&quot; New layer of security Bustamante is certain that antivirus software is becoming less effective, along with the security suites they&apos;re packaged with. Panda&apos;s idea for the near future is adding a new layer of security that it calls collective intelligence. He calls it the &quot;web 2.0 version of security&quot;: instead of keeping each user&apos;s computer separate, it&apos;s scanned from the &quot;cloud&quot;. This approach, he says, allows much bigger signature files and can detect targeted attacks because all computers are visible in real time. But even this approach won&apos;t last forever. Salvatore Stolfo, a professor of computer science at Columbia University, says the attackers &quot;have the upper hand. They have all the time in the world, and they have great motivation to spend their time and energy to avoid detection.&quot; Antivirus has a future, he says, but it may be in name only. &quot;Basic implementation and strategy will change.&quot; Like the fraud detection in use by banks and credit card companies, &quot;eventually, systems implanted in machines will learn your own personal behaviour and protect by detecting abnormalities&quot;. One has to hope so. Otherwise, the future looks bleak. \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/20/10", "sentences": ["Nasdaq had held an auction for the stake, attracting offers from other sovereign fund-backed bidders including the Qatar Investment Authority and Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings as well as Deutsche Borse and a number of Italian institutions."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-20T14:33:37Z", "title": "LSE caught in a takeover struggle", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "The London Stock Exchange is once again at the centre of a takeover struggle after close to half of its shares were snapped up by rival sovereign-backed firms from Dubai and Qatar.

A cooperative approach should see the Stockholm-based exhange group end up under Nasdaq ownership, Borse Dubai take a 28.4% interest in Nasdaq and the US firm invest in Borse Dubai operations, including the introduction of software to Dubai exchanges. &quot;The combination will create the largest global network of exchanges and exchange customers linked by technology,&quot; said Nasdaq&apos;s boss, Bob Greifeld. &quot;It&apos;s a triple-win transaction.&quot; But QIA has been quick to challenge plans for a series of international links between Nasdaq, Dubai and - potentially - OMX and the LSE. As well as challenging Borse Dubai in London, QIA also raided the market in Stockholm, buying up almost 10% of shares in OMX. It urged shareholders in the exchange group to take no action on the offer from Nasdaq/Borse Dubai. The Qatari market raid is believed to include transactions at 245 kronor a share - well above the value of the SK230-a-share offer from Borse Dubai. Shares in OMX closed up 7.7% at SK259 after a record day&apos;s trading. The equivalent of a third of all OMX shares changed hands. In the US, meanwhile, some politicians were again questioning the wisdom of allowing a sovereign-backed firm to take a dominant interest in a strategic US asset. President George Bush said: &quot;We are going to take a good look at it, as to whether it has any national security implications ... I&apos;m comfortable with the process.&quot; A routine review will be carried out by the US Committee on Foreign Investments. The committee was criticised last year for approving an acquisition by Dubai Ports World of the British firm P&amp;O, which included several US ports. The ports were sold on to a US firm nine months later after intense political pressure. Under the terms of its deal with Nasdaq, Borse Dubai will hold 20% of the US exchange group directly, with a further 8.4% held in trust. Mr Greifeld said he did not expect the deal to be blocked by issues of national security because, like all shareholders in US stock exchanges, Borse Dubai cannot hold more than 5% of voting rights. Backstory This is not the first time the London Stock Exchange has found itself at the eye of a takeover storm. In recent years it has fought off unwanted overtures from Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Australia&apos;s Macquarie Bank, Euronext and - twice - Nasdaq. Seven years ago a failed bid from OMX, then called OM, valued LSE at \u00a31bn. Since then, the highest offer has come from Nasdaq, valuing the exchange at \u00a32.7bn. It was defeated in February. Yesterday, the prospect of yet another takeover tussle - this time between two oil-rich, sovereign-backed Middle Eastern firms - sent shares soaring again. The business is now valued at almost \u00a33.4bn. Unlike many other leading exchanges around the world it enjoys no protection from foreign ownership."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/22/leadersandreply.mainsection", "sentences": ["We said that Nasdaq had auctioned the stake and that this had attracted offers from, among others, Singapore&apos;s Temasek Holdings."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-21T23:14:00Z", "title": "Corrections and clarifications", "tags": [], "article": "We reported that Borse Dubai and Qatar Investment Authority had purchased shares in the London Stock Exchange and mentioned that nearly all of the stake purchased by Borse Dubai had been previously controlled by Nasdaq.

Of course, a meal in uncomfortable surroundings is never going to be entirely fulfilling, but it goes much further than that. The formality or informality of the setting, the colour of the walls, the way our seat faces, even the way the light falls on our plate will all have an effect on our meal. At home we have a choice whether we eat in cosy clutter or spartan simplicity or somewhere between the two. We can make our own mind up whether to close the blinds or lower the lights. But in public spaces, be they restaurants or airports, art galleries or simply corner caffs, it is up to someone else to make those decisions for us. Anyone who designs a public eating space has to consider what is going to please the majority of users. This could, and often does, result in the bland and boring, yet more and more public spaces are becoming a pleasure to eat in. For this we have to thank the vision of the architects and those who back their flights of fancy. I have always wondered how those who are paid to consider the aesthetics of our public eating spaces eat and cook in their own homes. What are their kitchens like and how does their work relate to the home space? Once Richard Rogers had designed the River Caf\u00e9 with his trademarks of space and light, and Frank Gehry had woven his sensuous minimalism on New York&apos;s Cond\u00e9 Nast staff canteen, it opened up a world of opportunity for architects to get involved in eating spaces. We asked a host of famous architects where they felt good food and aesthetics meet. Daniel Libeskind gives us a glimpse of his Manhattan kitchen, Thomas Heatherwick shows off his outstanding new beachfront caf\u00e9 in Littlehampton and David Chipperfield welcomes us into his Galician villa.Nigel Slater Richard Rogers Lord Rogers of Riverside has previously worked alongside Norman Foster and Renzo Piano. In the last two years he has received the Pritzker and Stirling prizes. His previous projects include the Millennium Dome, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the National Assembly for Wales and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He is married to the Michelin-starred Ruth Rogers of the River Caf\u00e9.  Being the son of an Italian mother is a problem because Italian mothers don&apos;t allow their males to cook. Especially in my generation. I have five boys who cook, and I&apos;m the only one that doesn&apos;t, I just eat. I&apos;m the one let-down of the family. I was born in Florence and, culturally, I am Italian. It&apos;s very much in my blood. I try to spend as much time in Italy as I can - about seven weeks in total each year. My mother was a really good cook, an Italian Triestine. Their kitchen in England was probably the first I ever designed. Young architects have to start somewhere and it&apos;s usually the kitchens that need modernising. At our house, close to Pienza, there&apos;s an amazing wood oven and outdoor grill. We have competitions for pizza-making with any friends or family who happen to be staying. Just the decoration part, as long as Ruthie supplies the ingredients. All the sons, wives and grandchildren come and visit. There&apos;s often 20 for lunch. I always work on holiday, early in the morning. I have various memories of looking out of my parents&apos; house when I was about four or five and seeing a chair and a table put out for the local accountant. I thought, that&apos;s the idea, doing your business in a cafe, first thing in the day. I haven&apos;t quite got there but I&apos;m pretty close to it. I probably eat, do business, or just come and taste things in the River Caf\u00e9 every day. It&apos;s an extension of the community that I&apos;m part of. The space outside even more so. I&apos;ve been very fortunate. It was nothing to start off with. When the opportunity came up, the partnership bought the warehouses and we thought what a good idea to have a little restaurant. There were tremendous planning restrictions so it started as a canteen with sandwiches and came up from that. Ruthie&apos;s experience is purely domestic, that&apos;s why it&apos;s always been a hands-on, chef-led kitchen; and I&apos;ve known Rose Gray [co-head chef at the River Caf\u00e9] since she was 18. I don&apos;t choose the menus but we discuss food a lot. When we were completing the Pompidou and there was no other work coming in, Renzo Piano, Ruthie and I thought of writing a book called Sex, Food and Architecture. So it was very important to us, even then. We would often talk about the relationship between food and architecture. Food has the advantage of being more immediate. But they are both about a better quality of life. France in the Seventies was leading the way with its markets and atmosphere. Things have moved on to Spain and Italy because they offer simpler food and ways of cooking it. Renzo is my closest friend. I&apos;ll see him in 10 days&apos; time for his 70th birthday, and a week later in Genoa. We do a lot of talking. I think Britain has changed radically in the last 20 years. It was very behind in terms of its food and now it&apos;s as good as anywhere, especially London. I&apos;m a chief adviser to the mayor and we are on the way to giving London the best public spaces of any city. The street is the heart of the public domain and it&apos;s very much anchored by restaurants, cafes and benches, which you enjoy on a sunny day. I&apos;m all for not having an urban sprawl. I like places you can walk to. Cities are for the meeting of people, that&apos;s what it should be about. A friendly environment. David Chipperfield David Chipperfield (CBE) went solo in 1984 after working for Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Most of his work is in Germany, America and the Far East, but he has also designed a restaurant for Wagamama and the British Film Institute. Two new UK projects include art galleries in Wakefield and Margate.  People have different attitudes to cooking, and when you do a kitchen you have to design for the way they live. Now it is accepted that you spend a lot of time in the kitchen so you can give it as much attention as other rooms. It&apos;s no longer about being at the back of house. I like a kitchen in the middle of the house, whereas some people like to tuck them away. At the house in Spain it was fundamental that the kitchen was in the living space. I cook every night at 10 o&apos;clock for seven or eight weeks in the summer. Normally it&apos;s for about 20 and I do a pot of something using shells like crab or mussels. Galicia is famous for shells. I have about eight recipes that I use when cooking for large numbers. Many recipes started with Ruthie Rogers at the River Cafe and then got adapted for a large group of people. Galicia is famous in Spain for its fish and as the largest consumer of octopus in the world. In the old days we used to buy the fish straight off the boats. The fishermen give us things now and again but they&apos;re not really allowed to any more. It&apos;s all got to be taken to the market to be regulated. It&apos;s a very primitive part of the country and the weather is unpredictable, like a very warm Cornwall but without all the people. We invite lots - clients, and people from the office. Positioning kitchens in galleries and museums isn&apos;t really about cooking; it&apos;s about commercial criteria and whether they want the restaurants to be accessed independently to operate beyond the hours of the museum. In Germany there&apos;s an anxiety that the restaurant shouldn&apos;t be the first thing you see, whereas in England there&apos;s this commercial fear that if you don&apos;t see the restaurant you won&apos;t know it&apos;s there. You have to create an atmosphere in restaurants with a bit of complexity. The Ivy is a good example but I wouldn&apos;t necessarily have done it that way. I designed a Wagamama on Lexington Street in Soho for Alan Yau - I&apos;m a big fan of his, I like Busaba Eathai. Most people tend to stick to four or five restaurants and I&apos;m loyal to Jeremy King and Alan Yau. I also did a Nobu in Miami, Circus in Soho, and the restaurant in the Bryant Park Hotel in New York. I&apos;m doing a museum in Anchorage, Alaska. We were fishing once and a guy caught a salmon, grilled it there and then, but covered it in barbecue sauce and ruined it. In America they have a tendency to smother things. I do a lot of travelling and if I&apos;m in St Louis or Barcelona it&apos;s inevitable you end up going to dinner with a client. I&apos;ve become slightly jaded because when you go to lots of nice restaurants you get spoilt and you can&apos;t savour it in the same way. I don&apos;t think that the best food I ever tasted was in a restaurant. Will Alsop Will Alsop (OBE) is the founder of SMC Alsop. In 2000 he won the Stirling Prize for the Peckham Library. He has practices in Beijing, London, Shanghai and Singapore.  Architects don&apos;t build many buildings. When you have a commission you&apos;re going to have a relationship with that client for up to five years, so you&apos;ve got to be able to sit at a table together. I&apos;m obsessed with tables in one way or another. There are things that you&apos;d say and do around a table that you wouldn&apos;t do if it wasn&apos;t there: it&apos;s the function that interests me. I&apos;ve been thinking about a table with a sculpted surface so you can actually serve the food straight on to the table. Then you&apos;d have a slit down the middle where you can fit the waste sack and wipe food over it. I have designed it, but it would be extremely expensive to make. Many ideas stick in the back of my mind and when the time is right they&apos;ll come out. Maybe in a better form. I don&apos;t deal with names but many of my buildings are given them, which is fine. A new housing project in Manchester is called Chips because it looks like three chips on top of each other. It&apos;s in three chips because it&apos;s a nine-storey building and if you do it as a slab it just looks like a nine-storey slab. I often get accused of being too fun but what&apos;s wrong with that? There&apos;s no intellectual basis for trying to dismiss something as being merely fun. The converse of fun is boredom, misery or sadness. Will that make the world a better place? I don&apos;t think so, but there&apos;s a lot of it about. I like unlikely combinations and the element of surprise is vastly underrated in architecture. People like to turn a corner and go, What on earths that? What I like about Baltic is walking through a pair of curtains into a very mysterious dark space which opens up into a very light space. It&apos;s not over-designed and at the same time not austerely minimal, which would get on my nerves. I&apos;m austerely maximal. It was a genuine discovery for me when I was doing the Palestra building opposite. Ill usually order borscht, and they do very good liver. Its a winter cuisine really because in the Baltic they have a long winter. Magical summers, but they are short. I&apos;m a die-hard smoker. In Toronto, where I work regularly, smoking has been banned for a lot longer than here. Each year it gets more and more draconian. When I first went there you were only allowed to smoke on what they called the patio. Then they decided even if the patio has a protective roof over it of less than 4.5 metres, which is quite high, you&apos;re still not allowed to smoke there either. So, the enlightened restaurants raise their roofs if they can, but that&apos;s not always possible. In Manchester there&apos;s a bar called Dukes 92 and they&apos;ve got a huge patio with awnings and heaters which could probably seat 500 people. Now that&apos;s a response to the smoking ban. \u00b7 Baltic Restaurant, 74 Blackfriars Road, London SE1; 020 7928 1111; www.balticrestaurant.co.uk Amanda Levete Amanda Levete worked for Richard Rogers and Will Alsop in the Eighties. In 1989 she became one half of Future Systems whose most notable projects include Selfridges, Birmingham, and the NatWest Media Centre at Lord&apos;s Cricket Ground, which won the Stirling Prize in 1999. An architect can get a lot of work done in a restaurant. I bring my team from the office here if we have something to celebrate, or I bring a client, or I just come with my boyfriend. Eating is all about communication and exchanging ideas. There&apos;s a big blurring in my life between work and pleasure. It all merges into one and the restaurant is the venue for that. When I started working for Richard Rogers, the River Caf\u00e9 was like our canteen. At first I&apos;d take my mum there for a cheap bowl of soup but within months it had completely taken off. As it became more successful they&apos;d do special deals for those who worked there and then you&apos;d have to eat at slightly odd times. I&apos;ve got all Ruth&apos;s cookbooks and use them a lot. Richard&apos;s a lovely man. In most of the restaurants I frequent, there&apos;s a design/work connection. The director of Scott&apos;s, Mark Hix asked us to do a number of pieces: the crustacean holder, the champagne trolley and buckets, and the washbasins. With product design there&apos;s always a specific function: it&apos;s very exact. Other issues are its sculptural presence and ergonomic function. With a trolley, it has to be something that you can manipulate easily between tables and not take up too much room. Originally, Jeremy King commissioned us to do the trolley for the Ivy and the buckets for Le Caprice. With design you can explore the geometries and push the aesthetic in a way that you&apos;re not always able to with a building, because of the technical and functional constraints. Also, the return on your investment is four months. A building takes a long, painful, but rewarding, four years. The ground floor of Selfridges has got an oyster bar, a patisserie and a deli counter, and it has very much become the place to meet. Eating in a shop is very different from eating in a restaurant. You don&apos;t want to dwell. It was really important for us to provide a space in which you could feel equally comfortable with a small group or by yourself. Therefore we designed these petals that mean you can sit alone, or opposite one another. The ethos of the food hall was that it had a market feel. There aren&apos;t shelves. Everything is casually laid out, and low-slung, like a Moroccan market. The design is totally open and fluid. I&apos;m doing a private house in Dublin where the couple entertain on quite a large scale. We&apos;re doing all the furniture and cutlery so it&apos;s almost like a restaurant: it&apos;s about creating a quality and a presence that&apos;s comfortable but at the same time architecturally exciting. I&apos;ve always wanted to design a restaurant and you bet I&apos;d do the interior. For me I don&apos;t understand how you can separate the inside from the outside. Once we did a proposal with restaurateur Alan Yau for Battersea Power Station before it was sold. Alan had this great idea to cross a nightclub with a restaurant and brothel. It was going to be a 24-hour operation where you could rent booths by the hour. It was a wild brief and that extracted a wild proposal from us. I have favourite dishes at Scott&apos;s. The stone-bass ceviche served with deep-fried plantain, the Dover sole and the sea bream. There used to be a cod&apos;s tongue starter, and I should ask Mark why they took it off. I don&apos;t feel guilty about eating anything. I love dark chocolate, but prefer to have a starter and a main, and then a chocolate truffle with a coffee. I never get sick of eating out but I&apos;m not adventurous. I like to be introduced to places but I&apos;ll naturally go to ones I know. \u00b7 Scott&apos;s, 20 Mount Street, London W1; 020 7495 7309; www.scotts-restaurant.com Terry Farrell Sir Terry Farrell has had his own practice for over 40 years. His London projects include Embankment Place, the MI6 headquarters, and the Greenwich Peninsula masterplan, currently under way. In 2004 he was made the &apos;design champion&apos; for Edinburgh to advise on future development of the city.  Nicknames for buildings is a new thing and a lot are connected to food: the &apos;gherkin&apos;, the &apos;cheese-grater&apos;. A pair of tall buildings in Chicago which have circular balconies going around were very quickly called the &apos;corncobs&apos;. The only nicknames buildings used to have were derogatory ones. You could have easily called the gherkin the &apos;cruise missile&apos;. I believe a lot of architects invent the names at the time of design because an association with a smaller, familiar object makes it instantly cuddly and loveable. When I did Embankment Place it could never be given a simple name because it&apos;s a more complex kind of building. Whereas today, buildings look more like one-liners: they can be technologically much more sophisticated but there&apos;s a slight dumbing-down of the language. As design champion for Edinburgh, I&apos;ve had catered dinners in our apartment on York Place with MSPs, council leaders and other senior people. I do like to approve the menu in advance but not as much as my secretaries. They get terribly excited and worked-up about these things. And there&apos;s all sorts of protocol these days. Are they vegetarian? Any nut allergies? Once upon a time you were grateful for whatever you were given. Delikatesn is a tiny corner place down some stairs in New Town and, if it weren&apos;t for the menu they left us, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever have found it. It&apos;s like a home from home because I live next to a great Portuguese deli in London. My home is above the office in an old furniture factory on Lisson Grove, NW1. I once had a party for 150 people and the Spanish restaurant across the road brought in big pans of paella. It&apos;s called Don Pepe&apos;s but we call it the canteen. I subsidise a happy hour for the staff there on Friday nights. I like local businesses. Particularly in my area, which always needs a bit of support. In the course of an architectural career there are kitchens of all kinds. The conference centre in Edinburgh I designed takes 1,000 people, so the kitchen&apos;s right next to the dining area for a fast turnaround. I once did an extension to Rules restaurant in Covent Garden. I think it&apos;s the oldest restaurant in London. We almost doubled its size by extending into next door, matching the old building so it was seamless. I&apos;m involved in putting a restaurant in the library of the Royal Institution where they hold the Christmas science lectures. I&apos;ve argued that we should have carpets, tablecloths and curtains but, from the managerial side, this means stains on the floor, food smells in the curtains and tablecloths you have to clean. One of the recent revolutions of restaurant taste is the rise of what would be caf\u00e9 style. Hard surfaces and sharp acoustics have become upmarket. That would never have been good taste even 10 years ago. \u00b7 Delikatesn, 1a York Place, Edinburgh EH1; 0131 556 1133; www.delikatesn.com Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Rafael Vi\u00f1oly was born in Uruguay, educated in Argentina and emigrated to New York in 1978.

I don&apos;t know any of the fashionable restaurants. I don&apos;t need overly complicated experiences. I have a short temper for stupidity and I have an enormous counter-reaction to pomposity. My business is conducted in one place, Mezzogiorno, in the office or wherever the client wants to take me. It&apos;s like ballet: I know ballet is a wonderful thing to see but I&apos;m not cultivated enough for it, like I&apos;m not cultivated enough for food. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve missed something. Mezzogiorno is three blocks from the office. It is the most unremarkable place but it has this warmth and sense of purpose. It has a good Italian cook, early-Eighties decor, drawings and sculptures from Florence, and an atmosphere created by incredible, sympathetic owners. They know what I eat and suggest things. I&apos;m not fussy. We have an extremely good young Brazilian cook at home in downtown New York. My wife, Diana, helped her through one of the best cooking schools in New York. When we travel we take food on the plane prepared by her. She surprises us every night. You don&apos;t need to choose; you just sit down and there is something prepared. It&apos;s very Japanese in a way. There are some restaurants in Japan I&apos;ve been lucky enough to go to that are not even advertised - just a kitchen and six chairs. And you get no choice: you eat whatever the guy gives you. It is a completely different every time and costs more than the Hotel Bel-Air. I&apos;m doing a huge hotel in Las Vegas, with 14 restaurants. It is interesting that people in this industry, with an eye on the consumer, build with the idea that in six months&apos; time they will change again. I don&apos;t think that is a good thing - why change if it&apos;s working? But they change it simply to regenerate the image. It&apos;s very dangerous territory. In order to achieve excellence, things ought not to be on a seasonal cycle. You couldn&apos;t write Shakespeare on that basis. \u00b7 Mezzogiorno, 195 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012; (212) 334 2112; www.mezzogiorno.com Thomas Heatherwick Thomas Heatherwick is a designer, self-taught architect, artist and all-round visionary whose eclectic body of work includes the Rolling Bridge in London&apos;s Paddington Basin, the UK&apos;s tallest public sculpture, Manchester&apos;s &apos;B of the Bang&apos;, and the dramatic East Beach Cafe in Littlehampton. I&apos;m interested in things being particular to their location. For something to be sustainable, it has to be specific to its location, because the idea is to have a building that will never need to be recycled. The East Beach Cafe isn&apos;t a council project, and there&apos;s no additional funding. It&apos;s essentially funded by a Mr Whippy machine and we had an enormous responsibility to make that achievable. I met the owner Jane Wood at a party. She told me about her dream of having a beach caf\u00e9 and was very open to what it might be. We both agreed we didn&apos;t want anything that would hook on to sea cliches like sails or yachts. The site is closer to the sea than the buildings around it, so it didn&apos;t need to be caught in the tyranny of being &apos;in-keeping&apos;, so no polite reworking of Regency buildings. We asked ourselves: what is the character of the sea? We decided it&apos;s all the bits and bobs you find among the rocks and pebbles on the beach. The building didn&apos;t need to be pretty, but to be tough to cope with kids, sand and seagulls&apos; poo. There were practical constraints, like the site has a long promenade that we couldn&apos;t build on, and a high-pressure sewage line at the back, which meant it had to be long and thin. We didn&apos;t want windows at the back because it was a car park and so we played on the feel of being in a cave. We put diagonals going through to give it a stepped profile. Our work is mainly buildings now and it&apos;s progressed from Konstam [a restaurant in London&apos;s King&apos;s Cross] last year, which was just the interior, to this, a whole building. We&apos;re now working on a restaurant in Hong Kong. A restaurant is only as good as its food and its service. The design is third on the list. I admire chefs. They have to be brilliant all the time. That is terrifying for me because I am a slow thinker. As a designer of buildings you need time to immerse yourself. A chef has to produce his best work every day. I get my best ideas through discussion. I&apos;m trying to make a way we can all ricochet thoughts off each other; in the new studio there is a long, open kitchen and dining area. Meetings will take place virtually in the kitchen. The main reason is to have as many different groups bumping into each other as possible. In the studio there is a big group of architects but also people with diverse backgrounds like theatre design. I&apos;ve been interested in designing buildings since I was tiny. Buildings are fascinating because they need so many different forms of expertise. \u00b7 East Beach Cafe, Littlehampton, West Sussex; 01903 731903; www.eastbeachcafe.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/sep/23/architecture.foodanddrink1", "sentences": ["There are projects in South Korea, in Singapore, in the US - including a private house and a social housing project for the elderly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-22T23:03:57Z", "title": "Interview: Daniel Libeskind", "tags": ["Architecture", "Food & drink", "Art and design", "Life and style", "Culture"], "article": "When Daniel Libeskind was a boy, recently arrived in New York from Poland, he would spend his evenings watching his mother cook.

You can always do art in architecture, but you can&apos;t do architecture in art.&apos; And then she added, using the sort of metaphor that came naturally to her: &apos;You get two fish with the same hook.&apos; Ever since then, Daniel Libeskind - whose life went on to take, with stunning success, the very course his mother intended - has been attuned to the intimate relationship of architecture to food. &apos;Food and architecture are very closely entwined,&apos; he tells me over dinner at his favourite Japanese restaurant - Hasaki in New York&apos;s East Village. &apos;I think people no longer separate: here&apos;s architecture, and here&apos;s cuisine. It&apos;s a singular experience. In fact, I think they are getting closer. I designed a restaurant for the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, and it&apos;s a very spectacular place. It&apos;s like a museum space - it has a view over Toronto, and it&apos;s designed to give people who come to the museum not just a restaurant but an experience of where they are. And they&apos;ve hired a very, very good chef - he&apos;s creating a cocktail based on the form of the museum!&apos; The original sketches for the Royal Ontario Museum were drawn on napkins - and turned out to be so close to the final design that the napkins themselves were exhibited. In fact, Libeskind has produced some of his best work at the dinner table - his famous Jewish Museum in Berlin was mostly elaborated on kitchen roll. &apos;I know a lot of architects who draw on expensive paper that will never disintegrate and is designed for archives. To me that&apos;s a slightly fictitious version of the creative process. The creative process involves whatever pops into your head.&apos; Nina, Libeskind&apos;s wife and intensely close collaborator, is sitting next to him and smiling as he says this, recalling no doubt all the ephemeral pieces of paper she has been called upon to preserve. We had originally planned to have dinner at their place, a magnificent downtown loft with a view of the skyscrapers Libeskind found so enthralling when he first arrived in New York on the boat. Nina, by all accounts an incredible cook, was going to feed us. But just days before our dinner she fell and broke her wrist, so I am forced to picture their daily - or nightly - ritual instead. &apos;I could eat here every day,&apos; says Libeskind of Hasaki as they order a mountain of beautifully arranged sushi, &apos;but my favourite thing is not to go out, because we eat out so often around the world - by necessity. We travel a lot. To me the greatest celebration is when Nina cooks. And she&apos;s indomitable, because she comes home at 11 o&apos;clock and cooks a dinner. Once we were flying back from somewhere and got home at one o&apos;clock at night. She looked at me, and I had that look in my eyes, and she actually cooked a dinner. It was fantastic. And she&apos;s crazy because in New York almost no one cooks: you pick up the phone and order in five minutes.&apos; Every evening after they come home from their office near the World Trade Centre site, of which Libeskind is the master planner, Daniel and Nina crack open a bottle of champagne (their fridges are always stocked with it - at home and at work). Nina cooks in the small but functional kitchen that opens out into their main space, and Daniel sits at the bar overlooking the stove and reads her the New York Times. They usually eat at around 10pm. &apos;In 38 years of marriage,&apos; Nina tells me, &apos;we&apos;ve never had a meal at home without a bottle of wine, candles, and three courses.&apos; &apos;Sometimes our daughter&apos;s friends come over and they think there&apos;s some kind of party going on,&apos; adds Daniel with an impish grin. &apos;Rachel says: no, no, my parents do this every night!&apos; The Libeskinds&apos; three children - Lev, Noam and Rachel - grew up all over the world, exposed to an extraordinary range of cuisines (&apos;the only thing I don&apos;t cook is Japanese or Chinese food,&apos; says Nina), and with very fixed assumptions about what a meal entails. &apos;A meal is not just about eating,&apos; Daniel explains, &apos;it&apos;s a discourse. Some of our meals go on for five hours.&apos; No family meal, Nina adds, is ever under three hours. And she swears that the kids have never set foot in a fast-food joint. &apos;I had a very strict rule when the children were growing up,&apos; she says. &apos;We could not discuss work, and they could not discuss school. We could talk about literature, politics, ideas, fables - the kids were allowed to bring any book to the table.&apos; &apos;It was like a Haggadah,&apos; says Daniel, &apos;every meal is a storytelling meal.&apos; &apos;It wasn&apos;t like I didn&apos;t want to talk to them about school,&apos; Nina goes on, &apos;they could talk when they were cleaning up and at other times, but not at the dinner table. It really worked.&apos; Daniel is allowed to draw at this table, but not talk about his drawings - he can be inspired, but not discuss his inspiration. This routine has produced the most reliable, most literal food for thought over decades - and Libeskind wouldn&apos;t miss it for the world. One of his favourite stories is about the time when he was working on the Victoria and Albert Museum extension. &apos;I was invited to dine with the Queen,&apos; he recalls with a smile, &apos;in a very small setting. It was a Friday night, I was in London, and I said: I&apos;m sorry, I prefer to dine with my wife. Everyone thought I was crazy - no one forgoes an invitation to dine with the Queen of England! But it&apos;s true: I do prefer to dine with my wife.&apos; He smiles at Nina through his trademark black-rimmed glasses, and laughs his trademark laugh: it&apos;s infectious, and leaves him looking somewhere between a boy and a bear. Though he arrived in New York at the age of 13, Daniel Libeskind&apos;s accent still bears the imprint of his earlier life. When he first submitted his proposal for the World Trade Centre site - which has been a famously tortured and convoluted process - it was suggested in outrage that a &apos;real&apos; New Yorker would be a more appropriate candidate to memorialise those who had died on 11 September. Libeskind was appalled: there is arguably nothing more reflective of the real New York than the experience of an immigrant such as Libeskind. He now says, in the most gentlemanly way possible, that the project is &apos;going very well. It&apos;s started construction, and it&apos;s going to resemble my plan very closely. Despite all the battles and compromises and evolution of the project, you do your best. And it&apos;s going to shine with that spirit: maybe it will not be perfect, but it will be very moving. And that&apos;s New York.&apos; Libeskind has had a unique career as an architect: for most of his adult life he has been an academic, often teaching the most esoteric and theoretical aspects of architecture. Then he was invited to build a small museum in Germany honouring Felix Nussbaum, an artist who died at Auschwitz. &apos;Imagine that you&apos;ve been trained as a surgeon but you&apos;ve never had your hand on a scalpel,&apos; Libeskind wrote in his recent memoir, Breaking Ground. &apos;And someone says: &quot;Now you are going to operate on this head.&quot;&apos; But the project was close to his heart, and the eventual building such a success that he was invited to design the Jewish Museum as a result. In other words, Libeskind&apos;s very first building was completed when he was 52 years old, and his second opened to the public just six years ago. Now his office has over 40 projects on the go at once. Libeskind, now 61, doesn&apos;t have a desk of his own, but sits down with whatever team and project he chooses to focus on in the course of the day. He is phenomenally attentive to every detail of each scheme. There are projects in South Korea, in Singapore, in the US - including a private house and a social housing project for the elderly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. There is a tower in Warsaw that will be the tallest building in Europe and stands only a few blocks from where Libeskind&apos;s mother was born. The shapes that populate his office are a beautiful series of spikes and curves - squares that rotate into cylinders, cats&apos; cradles come to sparkling life, not just in the models and images of buildings, but in other forms, too. There is a Swarovski crystal-clad chandelier of LED lighting strips, a stainless-steel armchair, a spectacular grand piano. But what has set Libeskind apart ever since he dazzled people with his plans for the Jewish Museum is not, first and foremost, the look of the buildings, but the way in which they are each conceptually based in an almost epiphanic understanding of people&apos;s lives, and their most cherished ghosts. Perhaps because of the many years he spent as an academic architect - thinking rather than becoming mired in civic bureaucracies - he is interested in ideas, in what needs to be preserved and remembered, what needs to be conserved in terms of energy or cost, in how people live. Do they need a garden or a balcony, regardless of how many floors up they are? How do they like to shop? When do they need light, and when silence? When Libeskind was first taken to the World Trade Centre site, he pressed past the official tour until he came up against a vast, multicoloured and stratified barrier. What was it, he asked? Something called a &apos;slurry wall&apos;, he was told: the thing that held back the river, the boundary that had kept the rest of New York alive, without which the city would have been engulfed by water. Instantly, Libeskind knew the symbolic significance of this wall, and seeing beyond the idea of towers and monuments, decided that this single facade alone had to be a crucial part of any scheme. As he says, architecture, like food, is about the human beings involved: &apos;I was never interested in the aestheticisation of food,&apos; Libeskind elaborates. &apos;Of course food can be very beautiful, but it&apos;s what I&apos;ve always said about architecture - it&apos;s not about walls and plumbing systems. It&apos;s like music. Food is about life.&apos; If Libeskind&apos;s life has been in many ways coloured or punctuated by his relationship to food, that may be because it began in hunger. His mother Dora was one of 11 siblings from Warsaw, which had the largest Jewish population of any European city. His father Nachman was one of five, the son of an itinerant Yiddish storyteller from Lodz, which had the second-largest Jewish population. In 1939, both fled their homes and went to Russia, where they were captured by the Red Army (long before they met) and sent to hard-labour camps in Siberia and on the Volga. They were set free in 1942 and began a long trek south to Kyrgyzstan, where they hoped at least to be warm. It was there that the two Polish refugees met, fell in love, and starved together. As a famine took over the region, they survived on bugs and weeds. While their friends died, they managed to have a child - Daniel&apos;s sister Ania. When Dora discovered she was pregnant a second time, the couple chose to attempt the journey home. It was 1946; they had no idea what had become of Poland in the seven years they had been gone. Dora left Nachman in Warsaw to sell their only source of income - a sack of salt he had dug out of a mine - and went ahead to Lodz, to seek out Nachman&apos;s family, whom they assumed would take them in. When she arrived in Lodz, eight-and-a-half months pregnant and accompanied by their three-year-old daughter, Dora found that 85 of their immediate relatives had been killed. She wandered the streets - sobbing, with Ania clinging to her in fear - and finally, seeing a monstrous-looking female Russian guard with a Kalashnikov across her lap, begged the woman for help. The unlikely Samaritan took pity on them and let them sleep on a metal cot in the guardhouse. The next morning, Dora went into labour, and Daniel Libeskind was born. &apos;My father, because he was a survivor, said: always cook food you don&apos;t like,&apos; Libeskind tells me. &apos;Because if you like something, you come to desire it. My kids remember this very well. And he told me the reason for it, which was that when he was in a concentration camp in Russia, who would die first? People from well-off families, because they couldn&apos;t take the very reduced notion of eating, whereas the poor people would survive because they had no such expectations. So he developed this theory about not eating food you like - as a precaution.&apos; Still, Nina adds, he didn&apos;t have to be wedded to this idea while Dora was alive (she died in 1979), since every night after they moved to New York they ate well. Dora was a wonderful cook. &apos;My mother was a horrible cook,&apos; says Nina, who grew up in Canada. &apos;For many years nothing happened except what came out of a tin. And I&apos;ll never forget, when I met Daniel&apos;s mother ... when we were first married she invited me for dinner. She walked in with a basket of mushrooms, and I swear to you I had never seen a fresh mushroom in my life. I was 20 years old, and I thought: Wow! What do you do with those?&apos; Libeskind still remembers with great fondness a few of his mother&apos;s recipes - &apos;gogol-mogol&apos;, for instance, a Jewish eggy, honeyed concoction she would make when he was ill, and which almost made him look forward to sickness itself. Her herring, he says, would be his preferred last meal. And then, he says, turning to Nina, &apos;there one dish you cannot touch, and that&apos;s my mother&apos;s kreplach.&apos; &apos;I know how to make kreplach!&apos; Nina exclaims, a little peeved. &apos;Yes, but not the way my mother made it.&apos; And so, in this unassuming Japanese restaurant in New York, I am given a glimpse of a Jewish cliche in action: Libeskind and his personal &apos;madeleines&apos;. &apos;That&apos;s the most fundamental novel of the 20th century,&apos; Libeskind says of Proust, &apos;because the notion that food, that taste, can transform your life - could resurrect your life - is so beautiful, and so true, actually.&apos; If his mother&apos;s Polish cooking takes him back to his childhood, however, there have been other landmark meals as well. There was one in particular that offered the working-class boy a sudden surreal leap into another world, and altered his taste buds for good. &apos;I have to tell you that the most formative experience, in terms of cuisine, is the most crazy one that we&apos;ve ever had,&apos; Libeskind remembers with enthusiasm. &apos;We were living in the Bronx, and we were poor students - just married. Nina&apos;s parents had come to visit and they had left behind a guidebook - the best restaurants in New York. I was looking through it because I had just received a scholarship from New York state, and I said: let&apos;s celebrate. The book said the best French restaurant was Le Pavillon. You know, we were very naive because we never went to restaurants - neither did my parents. My father hated restaurants, because he hated to be served - he thought it wasn&apos;t right. Anyway, we made a reservation - for ourselves and a friend of ours, who was a hippie. The address was on Park Avenue and there was no sign, just a door. We opened the door, and I tell you - it was as if we&apos;d entered the headquarters of the King of France.&apos; Libeskind laughs at the memory. &apos;By the way, in retrospect, Le Pavillon was the restaurant where John F Kennedy used to eat, and the Rockefellers. It was where Kissinger met with Nixon - it was the greatest restaurant for the rich. So they looked at us as we walked in, and they must have thought we were the very esoteric children of some wealthy New Yorkers. To make a long story short, we were trapped.&apos; Nina shrugs: &apos;My menu didn&apos;t have any prices.&apos; &apos;It was beyond the point of no return,&apos; Daniel continues. &apos;We ordered incredible food - it was like a fantasy world.&apos; They both remember vividly the poached salmon hors d&apos;oeuvre, the veal, the Chablis. &apos;It was like something out of a Marx Brothers movie,&apos; laughs Daniel. &apos;At the end of the meal, the bill comes. Nina and my friend disappear. We have no credit card, nothing. It was the biggest bill I have ever seen in my entire life. Today it would have been an astronomical bill - a bill for a millionaire. I take out a check, and the waiter asks for some ID. I give him my school ID, which was Cooper Union. The guy says: I&apos;ve never heard of this union before. I said, well it&apos;s a famous school. He swallowed hard, and I thought he was going to call the police. So I wrote a cheque, and the irony was, it was almost my entire scholarship!&apos; Did they regret it? Not at all. It changed their lives: they never thought about food the same way again. As Libeskind puts it: &apos;Our experience in Le Pavillon was a revelation of a kind.&apos; Napoleon&apos;s pastry chef, who produced elaborate replicas of classical buildings made out of spun sugar, once famously remarked that &apos;the main branch of architecture is confectionery&apos;. I tell Libeskind that I recently read an article entitled &apos;Why Architects Look Sick at Building Dedication Ceremonies&apos;, which brilliantly evoked the fusion of the two arts by explaining that buildings are often opened with a celebratory cake in the shape of the work in question. The usually nervous architect is not only forced to consume a replica of his work in public, but is also obliged to look on as his supposedly permanent structure is symbolically destroyed at the stroke of a cake knife. Libeskind laughs - the only cake he&apos;s been made on such an occasion was a pleasure, he says. It was the Denver Art Museum, made by a famous local chef. &apos;Fabulous chocolate angles,&apos; he effuses. He goes on to mull over the food/architecture axis. &apos;One of my favourite books is Marinetti&apos;s Futurist Cookbook,&apos; he says. &apos;I&apos;ve always felt it was one of the most brilliant books - because, although it&apos;s supposed to be a cookbook, it&apos;s actually an architectural idea: that food needs as much structure and aesthetic attention as a building. I have a great edition of that book in my library. Even though we have not really used it as a cookbook - I think we once tried to do the meal that is the Italian flag - I use it as a book of architecture.&apos; He thinks back to the time when he was an academic - &apos;many years ago, another lifetime&apos; - and says: &apos;I had a very small studio of architecture students from all around the world, and we used to invite guests - Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman ... famous architects. And each student from a different country would prepare a meal. So the Brazilians would make a Brazilian meal, and the Italians would make an Italian meal for another guest. And that was their education: they remembered not so much the drawings as those meals - which were architectural in nature because they were like an international competition: who can impress a famous architect with a meal made in their honour by a nation?&apos; There is a single object in Libeskind&apos;s life that epitomises this link - that is both a throwback to those early dinners with his mother and the stone on which his career was effectively carved: his kitchen table. It&apos;s not particularly pretty, or large, or refined, but it&apos;s the first object Libeskind ever designed: a hefty wooden base with a grey spotted marble top. &apos;I designed this table in a very Duchampian way,&apos; he says gleefully, gesturing towards it when we are back in their apartment. &apos;We were living in Italy, in 1986, and the carpenter downstairs was using it to work on. I said, I need a table just like that.&apos; So he took it: a true ready-made, adapted only by its time-tested top. &apos;It did not originate as an aesthetic object, but out of necessity,&apos; Libeskind explains. &apos;And it&apos;s a great generator of real things: Rachel prefers to do all her computer work there. Noam and Lev love sitting at this table.&apos; They eat dinner there every night, he has drawn much of his best work there. &apos;There&apos;s something magical about a table that is real, that is not necessarily beautiful but that grew out of a real situation.&apos; And besides, he adds: &apos;Every time say: let&apos;s get rid of it, my family won&apos;t let me.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/23/escape.green1", "sentences": ["It was Sunday lunchtime when the shipping agent&apos;s car edged us between ziggurats of metal containers on the wharves of the Port of Singapore.", "Thirty-six hours of continuous loading activity later - we&apos;d boarded a little prematurely - two squat tugs edged our vessel out from the twinkling port lights and into the darkness of the Singapore Straits."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-22T23:07:15Z", "title": "The Slow Traveller", "tags": ["Travel", "Green travel", "Cruises"], "article": "It was Sunday lunchtime when the shipping agent&apos;s car edged us between ziggurats of metal containers on the wharves of the Port of Singapore. We were dropped off at the stern of the hulk that was to be our home for the next 10 days - the 213-metre, 30,000-tonne MV Theodor Storm, which would take us to Brisbane.  Through our cabin&apos;s porthole on the sixth floor of the ship&apos;s superstructure we had a vertiginous view into the cavernous hold below as cranes lowered cargo inside. Thirty-six hours of continuous loading activity later - we&apos;d boarded a little prematurely - two squat tugs edged our vessel out from the twinkling port lights and into the darkness of the Singapore Straits. These were safe waters according to the ship&apos;s second officer Pavlo, most piracy being confined to the nearby Straits of Malacca. The closest we got to anything pirate-like was the skull on our Ukrainian captain&apos;s heavy metal T-shirt. All the ship&apos;s officers and engineers bar one were either Russian or Ukrainian and initially presented the &apos;granite face&apos; with which we were so familiar from our Trans-Siberian experiences. The rest of the crew - greasers, oilers and technicians - were comparatively garrulous Filipinos, creating an apartheid based on rank, race and demeanour.  Anticipating boredom, we&apos;d come prepared with dodgy DVDs from Phnom Penh. We also had a daily Spanish lesson to pass the time, and played table tennis in what the ship called its gymnasium. This was a disappointment, unless your idea of a fat-burning, cardiac workout consists of endless high-impact ping pong.  Then there was the karaoke. The Japanese inventor of karaoke never made a penny from his creation, nor did he seek to, deriving satisfaction from the joy he has brought to millions around the world. We inflicted our poverty of musical talent on the unsuspecting Filipino crew over a couple of cases of Tiger beer. Clearly karaoke&apos;s main contribution to human civilisation has been to teach tolerance of others.  My girlfriend Fi was initially adamant: &apos;I am not singing.&apos; Several bottles later she was delivering her interpretation of Madonna&apos;s &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; to a room of sailors who&apos;d been at sea for three months. The Filipinos were wonderful singers (let&apos;s face it they have plenty of time to practise) melodiously crooning power ballads such as the Bangles&apos; &apos;Eternal Flame&apos; and Whitney Houston&apos;s &apos;I Will Always Love You&apos;. I managed an almost bearable version of Barry Manilow&apos;s &apos;Copacabana&apos;.  The lounge doubled as the DVD room, with a collection of martial arts movies and a few lewder titles, including The Lord of the G-Strings There was also entertainment beyond the ship. We cruised past a merrily puffing volcano near Sumatra, thick grey smoke and grit billowing into the blue sky. In the tranquil waters of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, humpback whales surfaced around us, occasionally thrusting themselves almost entirely clear of the water before crashing down again.  The whales were a joy to watch and we spent hours on the bridge, binoculars glued to our faces. The crew were unfazed. &apos;When I am at home I don&apos;t want a house with a sea view,&apos; noted Pavlo, as we scanned the otherwise featureless horizon for the umpteenth time."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/24/fashion.lifeandhealth", "sentences": ["Her collection in Paris is done in collaboration with a boutique in Singapore, where she was living over the summer, and she has &quot;quite a few&quot; independent projects coming up."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-24T09:42:01Z", "title": "Fashion world holds it breath for new Versace in the house that Gianni built", "tags": ["World news", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Italy", "Europe"], "article": "When Gianni Versace was murdered on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion in 1997, many feared the flamboyant and idiosyncratic empire he created would die with him. But far from withering away, the brand seems as strong as ever; and in the coming days, two events are likely to mark its complete rejuvenation. After a difficult period when the company appeared to be in decline, Gianni&apos;s sister Donatella will close Milan fashion week on Thursday, and within days, his niece will show her debut collection - under the Francesca V label - during Paris fashion week. It will be the work of Francesca that will be the cause of the biggest frisson - just a year after finishing her fashion design studies, the future of the dynasty may rest in her hands. Not that the pressure appeared to be affecting her. &quot;Fashion is in my blood and I&apos;m very excited about showing my collection,&quot; said the 25-year-old, whose father, Santo, controls the business side of Versace and is the brother of Donatella. Francesca&apos;s pedigree may explain her matter-of-fact reaction to having a major presentation in Paris so soon after graduating from the prestigious Central Saint Martins College in London - &quot;Well, I was looking around for something after graduating and this happened.&quot; Perhaps a sense of entitlement is not surprising from a young woman whose childhood wardrobe largely comprised wares from one of the most expensive brands in the world. Francesca&apos;s success neatly mirrors the return to prominence of the other, more famous range from the family stable, designed by her aunt Donatella, whose show will close Milan fashion week on Thursday night. This prestigious slot on the Milan fashion week schedule emphasises the place of importance still accorded to the famous brand. But after Gianni was killed just a month and a half before his &quot;dear friend&quot; Diana, few could have predicted the label would be so strong again. Donatella had been swiftly appointed creative director, although some questioned whether the woman best known for her love of parties was up to the job. By 2004, the company was struggling. Although it refuses to confirm exact figures, it was making markedly less a year than it did when Gianni was alive, with a year-on-year decline. The brand that had been so associated with excess and glamour of the late 80s and 90s was beginning to look out of date, and without a strong figurehead. The company cancelled its couture shows in 2003, and the following year Donatella was admitted to a drug therapy clinic for addiction to cocaine. But since she checked out and cleaned up, Donatella has worked hard to make the Versace brand as strong as it was in her beloved brother&apos;s heyday. Instead of trying to mimic Gianni&apos;s past successes she has given the brand a new, more modern, more elegant image. Instead of dresses made out of safety pins, as Elizabeth Hurley famously wore in 1994, recent successes include more demurely draped cocktail frocks and tailored trouser suits. The most recent financial figures which date from September 2006 show that in the first half of that year consolidated revenues came to \u20ac148m (\u00a3103m) and a return to profit before tax for the Versace Group of approximately \u20ac2m.Sales across the board increased, particularly in the lucrative accessories division which exceeded 30%. Now thanks to what the Versace financial report calls &quot;considerably increased cash flow&quot;, the company can indulge again in its love of excess. It recently announced it is to start designing the interiors of private jets and helicopters, a move the company describes as &quot;a natural extension within the Versace world&quot;. Donatella&apos;s last show in February received almost unanimously good reviews. As did her niece&apos;s graduate show in London in June 2006. Unlike the last graduate from the fashion college with an internationally famous surname, Stella McCartney, Versace received nothing but praise from the press for her graduate show, with fashion editors noting its &quot;professionalism&quot; and &quot;sleekness&quot;. Although Francesca&apos;s father has always been seen as the quiet one of the famous Versace siblings, his daughter appears to be following in her aunt&apos;s footsteps in more ways than one. Aside from her early success in the fashion world since her arrival in London to study fashion design at Central Saint Martins she has been a regular feature in gossip columns and has been linked with various young royals and Hollywood actors. &quot;She hangs around with a very Euro and Boujis set,&quot; said one of her friends in London, referring to the west London nightclub frequented by Princes William and Harry. Yet like her aunt she clearly takes her designing seriously. Her collection in Paris is done in collaboration with a boutique in Singapore, where she was living over the summer, and she has &quot;quite a few&quot; independent projects coming up. &quot;Having this name can work against you or for you,&quot; she said on the phone last week. &quot;Right now things are going very well.&quot; In the blood Gianni Versace The man behind some of fashion&apos;s most iconic moments and head of an empire which at its height made over $1bn a year in sales. In 1997 he was murdered outside the house in Miami which he shared with his longterm partner. His killer later killed himself. Donatella Versace Youngest and most recognisable Versace sibling. Her celebrity-laden lifestyle made her Gianni&apos;s muse, and she became creative director when he died. After an initial downturn, which ended after she was admitted to a clinic for drug addiction, Donatella has returned the company to its former glory. She owns 20% of the company and her daughter Allegra, 18,owns 50%. Santo Versace The less flamboyant and eldest sibling. Established the Versace brand with Gianni in 1977, now in charge of the business side and many credit him with a large part of the recent resurgence. He almost never gives interviews. He owns 30% of the company. Francesca Versace The only daughter of Santo, Francesca&apos;s childhood alternated between the academic expectations of her father to hanging out backstage at her uncle&apos;s shows with Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. She trained at the prestigious Central St Martins in London. She has only asked her aunt for advice once but Donatella&apos;s response was: &quot;You know how to do it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/24/monksversusgenerals", "sentences": ["The tragedy of Burma is fast approaching African dimensions of deprivation created by an oriental despotism..

In Rangoon, the monks fearlessly swept past the police barricades around the house of Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the persecuted opposition party the National League for Democracy, who has been held under house arrest ever since her election victory in 1990. She held an impromptu meeting with the monks and joined them in prayers. &quot;The Lady&quot; - as everyone calls her - remains the one great hope for a new Burma. A potent feature of the protests has been the declaration by the monks&apos; union of &quot;patam nikkujjana kamma&quot; - a boycott of alms from members of the military regime, or simply overturning their bowls instead of collecting food. One young monk justified this ban on the armed forces as equivalent to excommunication in the Christian church. This sanction includes a refusal to conduct funeral and weddings services and a ban on other Buddhist ceremonies for members of the military. Attempts by the generals to curry favour with temples to offer alms, and donate handsome gifts to senior abbots have failed to win the blessing of the majority of monks. Monks were prominent against British colonial rule in this predominantly Buddhist country. Two well-known monks, U Wisara and U Ottama, were imprisoned by the British for their nonviolent resistance, and U Wisara died in jail after a hunger strike lasting 166 days. In August 1988 monks helped to inspire a peaceful uprising against the regime that came close ousting it, but the generals recovered and ordered all-out suppression of pro-democracy crowds in the street. In Burma the chances of any so-called &quot;velvet revolution&quot; as happened recently in the Ukraine and in parts of Eastern Europe appears to be highly unlikely. In 1988, besieged by massive popular protests, the generals ordered their troops to shoot unarmed demonstrators in their thousands. Since 1988 bloodbath the generals have massively expanded their army and security services, and switched the capital from Rangoon to the obscure ultra-secure town of Naypyitaw, well-protected from the people that they rule. They have never deviated from their iron-fisted determination to cling on to power despite international lobbying for dialogue with the opposition - intimidated but never silenced. But after the military, it is the Buddhist monks who represent the most important institution in Burma today - revered by almost everybody. Are we heading for another showdown? The civilian population has enthusiastically cheered the stand taken by the monks but remains wary of what happened in 1988. If massive bloodshed is to be averted, the EU, Buddhist countries and South-East Asian nations all need to act now, putting human rights before trade, and to act in respect the heroism of buddhist monks in Burma. With the junta still a little rattled by these rolling demonstrations of defiance there is a rare window of opportunity for the world to help the Burmese people. If the EU and Burma&apos;s neighbours were to speak with one voice, warning the regime against another 1988, it could make a difference. Sanctions can only work where there is an overwhelming consensus of nations about the pariah status of a regime. South Africa under apartheid was the classic example. Just as the Zimbabwe disaster should be on the conscience of Africa, so Burma is the special responsibility of South-East Asian nations (Asean). The generals need to be told that more atrocities will result in punishment: to kick them out of Asean; a suspension of all tourist links. And it is above all the voice of Asian countries - Asean, India and China - that should be heading efforts to avert a disaster."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/25/arsenal.premierleague", "sentences": ["The disappointment will be felt most sharply in Madrid, who were beaten in Singapore two years ago."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-24T23:13:52Z", "title": "Digger: Arsenal may expand Emirates", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Arsenal"], "article": "As Arsenal&apos;s rivals ponder yesterday&apos;s spectacular financial results announcement from the Premier League leaders, they will be dismayed to learn that the Gunners are set to explore another possible stadium expansion. &quot;The next board will extend this stadium and build 100,000 on the roof,&quot; Ars\u00e8ne Wenger joked last week.

Encouraged by Gordon Brown&apos;s plans to make this the nation&apos;s greatest-ever sporting decade, some of the biggest powerbrokers in British sport have descended on the venue. Last night the Football Association&apos;s chief executive, Brian Barwick, turned compere for a football quiz night with the fans&apos; group Supporters Direct. This evening it is the turn of Nic Coward, head of the British Horseracing Authority, who is chairing a Q&amp;A for Sports Think Tank involving the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, to discuss how the passing of the baton into the Brown era will affect sport. Lord Coe, below, then hosts an open-platform fringe meeting with the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, to discuss progress on London 2012. Chicago leads 2016 battle One of the better bets in sport is that Coe&apos;s London team will be handing over their baton to Chicago for the 2016 games. Always the front runner ahead of an eclectic mix of predominantly Asian and European bidders, the city has been tipped for success by one of the few senior Olympic insiders who consistently claimed London would win last time round. The disappointment will be felt most sharply in Madrid, who were beaten in Singapore two years ago. Clarke in pole Voting closed at 5pm yesterday on the election for the next chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. Giles Clarke, the Somerset chairman, was said to have been in high spirits yesterday; presumably following feedback from his county colleagues. It would be a remarkable triumph after Clarke&apos;s candidacy - aimed at currying favour among the counties over the redistribution of international income - came up the rails to split the 19-man vote in August, forcing the second head-to-head run-off with the ECB&apos;s current deputy chairman, Mike Soper, which ended yesterday. Red faces at FIA Motorsport&apos;s world governing body, the FIA, appears to have entered a damage-limitation exercise after its laudable attempts at regulatory transparency seemed to backfire. In an effort to restore confidence in its disciplinary processes it posted transcripts of the two world motorsport council meetings that led to McLaren being fined \u00a350m for industrial espionage of Ferrari secrets. Passages deemed too sensitive for publication were blacked but unfortunately, according the Italian daily Gazzetta dello Sport, the FIA was slightly too transparent: &quot;All it took was to cut and paste from the Acrobat document on the FIA&apos;s website into a Word document and all the blacking vanished.&quot; Among the confidences betrayed by the mistake, the newspaper claimed, was the revelation from McLaren&apos;s chief executive, Ron Dennis, that his team&apos;s controversial chief designer, Mike Coughlan, was earning a salary of between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3400,000.

ALL EYES ON BURMA &quot;Burma: The world watches&quot;, declares the Independent this morning alongside a close-up of the praying hands of a saffron-clad monk. As troops moved onto the streets of Rangoon and the country&apos;s ruling military junta threatened to use force against the pro-democracy campaigners, the international community stepped up appeals for restraint. It is this community, and particularly Burma&apos;s neighbours and economic partners, that are the key to resolving this stand-off peacefully, says the Indy. It is likely that pressure from China has stayed the generals&apos; hands so far, and more of the same from the likes of India, Thailand, Singapore and Russia is needed. &quot;It is time for the international community to convince the country&apos;s leaders to engage in a dialogue with their opponents. They need to recognise that speaking to those who are demanding democracy with such courage is now the only acceptable way open to them,&quot; argues the paper. A protester interviewed in the Guardian describes how the economic situation in the country has helped to fuel the protests. &quot;There are more and more restrictions every day. People have much less freedom even than they did before and I couldn&apos;t stand by and watch these mounting problems any more. Sure, we had difficulties before, but the price hikes were the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. Living standards have gone down and down. The middle classes have become poor, and the poor have become destitute.&quot; It is dangerous to be involved in the protests, he admits, but also exciting: &quot;I really believe we have the power to create a new environment in which we can bring about democratic change.&quot; The world may be watching, but how much are they being allowed to see, wonders the Telegraph. The paper reports that access to the internet appears to have been blocked in Burma and telephone services have been disrupted. It says it &quot;struggled to find even the most innocuous site that remained accessible&quot; and says the regime apparently plans to crush dissent without international scrutiny. The Times is more hopeful of the ingenuity of the young activists and says they have sent out a steady stream of images through proxy sites that surmount the firewalls. The IHT offers an insight into the nature of the dictatorship being challenged by the tens of thousands of protesters. The junta is a small clique of mostly unsophisticated former field commanders who seem suspicious of the outside world and of better-educated Burmese like the opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, says the paper. The generals head a military whose strength is estimated at upward of 400,000. While hunkered down, delusional and paranoid at the moment, the junta has been remarkably successful by one tally at least, says the IHT: &quot;It has kept its grip on power for two decades while giving the people of Myanmar little reason to support it.&quot; * &apos;The middle classes are now poor&apos;* Independent: Burma: the world watches* Independent: People power* Telegraph: Most people are afraid* Times: Riot squads prepare for action MILIBAND GETS MIXED RECEPTION While the sketch writers are united in amusement at the foreign secretary&apos;s appearance (&quot;Mr Potato Head&quot;) and delivery (&quot;Dr Jonathan Miller presenting Play School&quot;), the content of David Miliband&apos;s speech at the Labour party conference gets a mixed response. He &quot;rose to the challenge&quot;, approves the Guardian, by addressing the big questions and doing so in a framework that set out the role Britain can play in addressing what is wrong in the world. He made an &quot;honest recognition&quot; of the situation in Iraq - he admitted that the government needed to stop and think about how its actions had alienated millions of Muslims and needed to learn lessons - and was right to warn against institutional navel-gazing in Europe. &quot;Anodyne&quot;, scoffs the Times, in contrast. &quot;Too nice and too wet.&quot; The government is in danger of starting to behave like a non-governmental organisation such as Oxfam, and international relations are in danger of becoming a multilingual version of social work, the paper worries. We all know what the Mail thinks about social workers, so it will come as no surprise to find that it, too, pours scorn on Mr Miliband&apos;s debut speech. &quot;He managed to combine a lamentable delivery with an irksome content,&quot; complains the paper&apos;s Quentin Letts. It was &quot;simultaneously patronising and babyish&quot;. Ouch. The Sun meanwhile, is feeling rejected. &quot;Silly Mili&quot;, pouts the red-top, hurt that the foreign secretary has ignored its call for a referendum on the EU constitution. By sidestepping the issue, the boy David &quot;reveals his contempt for Sun readers ... To him they are too ignorant and prejudiced to comprehend the subtleties of the great issue of our age,&quot; the red-top grumbles. Still, at least another David is on the Sun&apos;s side. &quot;I&apos;ll give you EU vote,&quot; the Conservative leader, David Cameron, promises the soaraway&apos;s readers. He finds himself in the esteemed company of the paper&apos;s &quot;team of Gordon Brown lookalikes and Page 3 girls Nikkala, Becky and Ruth&quot; who have pitched tents and set up a protest camp at Westminster. Becky, 24, says: &quot;We&apos;re here to show that we won&apos;t rest until Mr Brown has got the message that we demand a referendum&quot;. Meanwhile, the Mail has some good news for Gordon Brown with a splash that women voters have given him a commanding 11-point lead over the Conservatives. According to the YouGov poll released last night, Labour is now on 44%, ahead of the Conservatives on 33%. The findings are a &quot;shattering blow&quot; to Mr Cameron, says the Mail, and will intensify pressure on the prime minister to go for a November election. * Not yet a doctrine, but a vision* Times: Making nice* Mail: Women voters turn to Brown BALLS UNVEILS EXAMS SHAKE-UP The Times and the Telegraph both lead on government plans for a radical shake up of the school exam system, to be unveiled by Ed Balls at the Labour conference today. The schools secretary will announce that the authority that regulates examinations is to be broken up and replaced by an independent body. The move has been likened to Labour&apos;s decision to make the Bank of England independent in 1997. It is designed to give A-levels and GCSEs more credibility. In an interview with the Telegraph, Mr Balls says he hopes the reform will &quot;put behind us the sterile debate about dumbing down&quot;. However, the Telegraph is not so sure that a new regulatory regime will be enough to achieve that aim. Public examinations need more rigour, it argues. A more sophisticated mechanism would succeed in identifying the brightest and the best, and &quot;only then will the integrity of examinations be restored&quot;. *  Times: Dumbing down fears force exam shake-up* Telegraph: School exams authority to be scrapped* Telegraph: A man with a plan for school exams CHILD IN A PHOTO A possible sighting of the missing child Madeleine McCann in Morocco provides the lead for the tabloids this morning. They feature a blurry picture of a blonde child carried on the back of an African woman in Zinat, northern Morocco. The photo was taken by a Spanish tourist 25 days ago and was the fourth reported sighting in Morocco of a girl fitting Madeleine&apos;s description since she disappeared on May 3. The Mirror, which claims to have the &quot;full astonishing story&quot; says that the photo is being scrutinised by Interpol. * Mirror: Maddy in Morocco? IRAN&apos;S TRANSSEXUAL TREND The visit of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to New York was theatrical and ultimately illuminating, says the Times. It &quot;provided evidence of nothing so much as sheer mendacity&quot;. The paper worries that time is running out to tackle Iran&apos;s nuclear plans through diplomatic channels and urges the EU to tighten its sanctions against the state even in the absence of new UN sanctions. The Guardian is more concerned with Mr Ahmadinejad&apos;s claim that there are no gays in all the villages of Iran. The paper says this assertion is somewhat undermined by the fact that Iran carries out more gender-change operations than any other country in the world besides Thailand. Whereas homosexuality is considered a sin, transsexuality is categorised as an illness to be cured, and gender-change operations are supported by state funding. According to the leader of Iran&apos;s main transsexual organisation, some of those undergoing operations were gay rather than out-and-out transsexuals. Meanwhile, outraged international gay rights activists have recalled numerous executions under Iran&apos;s sodomy laws. * Sex change funding undermines no gays claim* Times: Leader: Normal craziness MORE THAN JUST A GAME  The Independent calls it the &quot;Harry Potter of video games&quot;. Last night thousands of gamers across Britain queued at shops for the European release of Halo 3 for the Xbox. The video games market is fast becoming the entertainment industry&apos;s most lucrative battleground, explains the Guardian. In six years Halo has become the most profitable video game franchise in history, selling more than 15m copies worldwide. In the first 24 hours after it went on sale in the US on Monday, the game racked up $125m (\u00a362m) in sales. By comparison, the Spider-Man 3 movie - which broke box office records when it was released this summer - made $151m in its first three days. The Indy concedes that &quot;for anyone who hasn&apos;t played a video game since Pong was all the rage, it might seem preposterous that a game can go head to head with a Hollywood blockbuster and win&quot;. However, &quot;to its fans, Halo 3 is more than just a game&quot;, it says. On some websites dedicated to the game, players were yesterday swapping tips on &quot;excuses to get out of work to play Halo 3&quot; and sharing their &quot;Halo 3 camp-out plans&quot;. The paper puts the game&apos;s success down to its use of cutting-edge technology, its strong narrative and high production values. And, of course, &quot;people like spaceships and shooting aliens&quot;. The Telegraph says if the game itself doesn&apos;t blow you away, then the price will. In the US prices start at around $60 (\u00a330), but the same basic edition of the game in Britain has a recommended retail price of \u00a349.99. * Halo 3 enters the fray* Independent: Big game NAVIGATING SHAKESPEARE An intriguing new map inspired by the London Underground features in the Guardian today. The Greater Shakespeare is a tube-style diagram on which the Bard&apos;s warriors, villains, fools and heroes get their own lines, linking character-types together. So Gertrude, mother of Hamlet, appears as a sort of Shakespearean Embankment, at a crucial interchange where the Mothers line crosses Strong and Difficult Women. Henry V is at the junction of the Heroes and Warriors lines, while pairs of happy lovers are gathered in what would be the Theydon Bois and Hainault regions of the Central line. Rosalind and Orlando (As You Like It) and Viola and Orsino (Twelfth Night) are accompanied by unisex toilet signs to indicate the sexual ambiguity of the plays. Meanwhile, would-be lovers in Paris have come up with a new dating service courtesy of the city&apos;s successful self-service bike scheme. &quot;It&apos;s the perfect pickup,&quot; said Florian, a 23-year-old graduate student who was pedalling on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. &quot;You exchange glances waiting at a light, you help her dock the bike back on to its stand and one thing leads to another.&quot; The almost-free bikes, which now number 14,000, have been taken out on 5m trips since the scheme launched in July, and hundreds of blogs and websites dedicated to the sturdy grey Velibs have blossomed. On blogvelib.fr, riders can leave messages on a forum called Coup de foudre \u00e0 V\u00e9lib Hill (Love at first sight on Bike Hill). &quot;A week ago, we chatted about the different V\u00e9lib subscriptions,&quot; Jean-Jean wrote to an unknown woman. &quot;You were magnificent in that dress, your long hair shining in the light ...

The situation allows people not to account for revenues they receive.&quot; Forty per cent of the world&apos;s states are listed in the survey as having &quot;rampant corruption&quot;.Ms Labelle said most of the countries were desperately poor, with looting by public officials an enormous drain on resources.

BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the plane, the world&apos;s largest passenger jet, would help it compete on routes to Asia that feature fellow A380 customers including Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Flights between Europe and Asia are expected to increase to take 56 million passengers a year by 2011, compared with just over 40 million last year.   &quot;If you look at our network we are a big operator in Asia today,&quot; said Mr Walsh. &quot;A number of those routes \u2014 Hong Kong, Singapore and India \u2014 support large aircraft and the A380 is a great fit with destinations that we serve.&quot;   Experts said BA needed the A380 to compete with rivals such as Dubai-based Emirates and Australia&apos;s Qantas, which have placed large orders for the superjumbo and will therefore be running much bigger planes out of Heathrow on routes where they compete with BA.   Chris Partridge, an aviation banker at Deutsche Bank, said: &quot;Airlines will be putting more capacity than BA on core Asian routes out of Heathrow. Also, Heathrow is full, so there are fewer ways that you can get seats on to the tarmac.&quot;   The A380 allows BA to add seats on routes where there is significant demand but a limited number of flying slots, such as Hong Kong to Heathrow, which crams its three daily departures into one hour of the day. The airline has also taken out an option on a further seven superjumbos.   Today&apos;s order represented a partial break with Boeing, previously BA&apos;s exclusive provider of long-haul aircraft, but the US aviation firm also won a significant slice of business \u2014 BA said it would order 24 of Boeing&apos;s 787 Dreamliners, with an option for a further 18.   The 330-seat Dreamliner will be used to expand capacity on existing routes or launch new services, because using a 525-seat A380 on a route that does not have the demand might glut the market with too many seats and drag down prices.   Mr Walsh said it was &quot;far too simple&quot; to see the A380 deal as a tit-for-tat exchange with Emirates and Qantas. &quot;We are not buying this because somebody else has bought it. We have made this decision on the basis of what is right for BA,&quot; he said.   The total order was worth $8.2bn by current list prices but BA confirmed it received an undisclosed discount for both aircraft, which led one analyst to speculate that BA had in fact paid closer to $6bn.   BA also said Derby-based Rolls-Royce would make the engines for both aircraft, which are to be delivered between 2010 and 2014, with the first A380 arriving in 2012. The BA boss admitted the lack of available slots at Heathrow, which is 98.5% full, had influenced the A380 decision.   Mr Walsh said BA had not encountered any political interference &quot;formally or informally&quot;, following a report that the government had leant on the airline to choose Airbus and Rolls-Royce because it would benefit UK workers.

But at the same time, the US unveiled new sanctions against the country&apos;s leaders and called on the international community to unite in applying pressure on the regime. The US treasury announced sanctions against 14 senior government figures in the Burmese junta, which is attempting to stamp out the most serious challenge to its rule in almost 20 years.  The treasury will freeze the assets that the Burmese officials have in US banks and other financial institutions, while US citizens are prohibited from doing business with them. The new measures come on top of an arms and trade embargo as well as a ban on financial transactions with Burma. The White House also demanded that the UN special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, who is on his way to the region, be granted full access to Burmese opposition leaders, including those jailed by the junta and religious leaders. UN officials said they had been assured that the envoy would be &quot;welcomed&quot; by the Burmese government. George Bush issued a pointed challenge to China, among others, to wield its influence in Rangoon to tell the junta to cease using force against the demonstrators. &quot;I call on all nations that have influence with the regime to join us in supporting the aspirations of the Burmese people and to tell the Burmese junta to cease using force on its own people, who are peacefully expressing their desire for change,&quot; the US president said. &quot;By its own account, the junta has already killed at least nine non-violent demonstrators, and many others have been injured and arrested as they seek to express their views peacefully.&quot;  China has already joined Russia in shielding Burma from moves by western powers at the UN security council to impose sanctions, arguing that such measures would represent interference in Burma&apos;s internal affairs. China, Burma&apos;s largest trading partner, is regarded as crucial to the international response, and today it issued a call for restraint, no doubt concerned that its close association with Burma&apos;s general may tarnish its image ahead of next years Olympic games in Beijing. Other south-east Asian nations today expressed &quot;revulsion&quot; to Burma&apos;s foreign minister at the violent repression of demonstrations and strongly urged the military government &quot;to exercise utmost restraint and seek a political solution&quot;. A statement issued after a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said the ministers &quot;were appalled to receive reports of automatic weapons being used and demanded that the Myanmar government immediately desist from the use of violence against demonstrators&quot;. Australia plans to follow the US lead on targeted measures against Burmese figures. The prime minister, John Howard, said his country would further tighten visa restrictions on Burmese officials and consider targeted financial sanctions. The EU has a common position on Burma, but its measures are much less effective. Although there is an arms embargo, a ban on investment in named state companies excludes key sectors, such as oil, gas, gems and timber. The list also names a pineapple juice company and a tailor. But the EU may be about to change with France, which currently holds the presidency of the UN security council, taking a tougher line. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, this week called on French businesses, including the oil giant Total, to freeze investments in Burma in response to the crackdown. That would be a major step as France is the leading European investor in Burma. Critics of the junta say Total&apos;s investment provides much needed funds for a government that spends over 40% of its national budget on military expenditures, while 0.4% of gross domestic product is spent on health and education. Britain has also taken a strong stand on investments in Burma. In 2003, British American Tobacco (BAT), at the request of the government and under pressure from groups such as the Burma Campaign UK, sold its share of a factory in Burma to a Singapore-based company.

BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the plane, the world&apos;s largest passenger jet, would help it compete on routes to Asia that feature fellow A380 customers including Emirates and Singapore Airlines. Flights between Europe and Asia are expected to increase to take 56 million passengers a year by 2011, compared with just over 40 million last year. &quot;If you look at our network we are a big operator in Asia today,&quot; said Mr Walsh. &quot;A number of those routes - Hong Kong, Singapore and India - support large aircraft and the A380 is a great fit with destinations that we serve.&quot; Experts said BA needed the A380 to compete with rivals such as Dubai-based Emirates and Australia&apos;s Qantas, which have placed large orders for the superjumbo and will therefore be running much bigger planes out of Heathrow on routes where they compete with BA. Chris Partridge, an aviation banker at Deutsche Bank, said: &quot;Airlines will be putting more capacity than BA on core Asian routes out of Heathrow. Also, Heathrow is full, so there are fewer ways that you can get seats on to the tarmac.&quot; The A380 allows BA to add seats on routes where there is significant demand but a limited number of flying slots, such as Hong Kong to Heathrow, which crams its three daily departures into one hour of the day. The airline has also taken out an option on a further seven superjumbos. Yesterday&apos;s order represented a partial break with Boeing, previously BA&apos;s exclusive provider of long-haul aircraft, but the US aviation firm also won a significant slice of business - BA said it would order 24 of Boeing&apos;s 787 Dreamliners, with an option for a further 18. The 330-seat Dreamliner will be used to expand capacity on existing routes or launch new services, because using a 525-seat A380 on a route that does not have the demand might glut the market with too many seats and drag down prices. Mr Walsh said it was &quot;far too simple&quot; to see the A380 deal as a tit-for-tat exchange with Emirates and Qantas. &quot;We are not buying this because somebody else has bought it. We have made this decision on the basis of what is right for BA,&quot; he said. The total order was worth $8.2bn by current list prices but BA confirmed it received an undisclosed discount for both aircraft, which led one analyst to speculate that BA had in fact paid closer to $6bn. BA also said Derby-based Rolls-Royce would make the engines for both aircraft, which are to be delivered between 2010 and 2014, with the first A380 arriving in 2012. The BA boss admitted the lack of available slots at Heathrow, which is 98.5% full, had influenced the A380 decision. Mr Walsh said BA had not encountered any political interference &quot;formally or informally&quot;, following a report that the government had leant on the airline to choose Airbus and Rolls-Royce because it would benefit UK workers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/28/burma.topstories3", "sentences": ["Significantly, the prime minister, Lt Gen Soe Win, is thought to be terminally ill in a Singapore hospital."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-27T23:08:39Z", "title": "Opposing forces: The generals and the monks", "tags": ["World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "The man who would be king It is a shadowy, eccentric junta that rules Burma. Led by General Than Swe, a high-school dropout who has pretensions to being the country&apos;s next monarch, the army spreads paranoia and fear. Gen Swe&apos;s ambitions first surfaced in 2005 when he emerged as the driving force behind the bizarre decision to move the national capital 400km north from Rangoon to Naypyidaw - which means Abode of Kings - in 2005. From behind a heavily fortified compound, rising out of thick tropical scrub, emerge persistent rumours that the country&apos;s long-abolished monarchy would be reconstituted. Than Swe would become king. Seen as clever and superstitious, Gen Swe&apos;s reputation became tabloid fodder when a video of his daughter&apos;s wedding began to circulate on the internet. The footage shows Thandar Shwe covered in diamond-encrusted jewellery and designer clothing. She received wedding gifts worth $50m (\u00a325m)- in a country where per capita income is $200 a year. In Burma&apos;s intensely hierarchical system, the 74-year-old is the paramount leader. His ruthless streak is such that he toppled his prime minister Khin Nyunt in 2004 because he was seen as becoming too &quot;pragmatic&quot; when dealing with pro-democracy activists. The only man considered more hardline than Gen Swe in Burma is his deputy: 69-year-old Gen Maung Aye. He made his name in a reign of terror against ethnic minorities and communists. Gen Swe has spent most of the last few years cultivating the third in line, Gen Swe Mann. Significantly, the prime minister, Lt Gen Soe Win, is thought to be terminally ill in a Singapore hospital. The army can call on almost 500,000 troops and the official line is that only the military can bind the country together and develop its economy. The leadership has just finished a national convention, the first of seven promised steps to democracy. This event began in 1993 and the result is a constitution that guarantees the military control over the cabinet. Revered challenger to regime The Buddhist clergy are revered in Burma and represent the only institution that has not been co-opted by the military. There are an estimated half a million monks and novices in the country, comprising the sole organisation that compares to the armed forces in terms of scale. The number of monks and nuns is so large because Burmese society expects every person to renounce material ways for at least seven days in their life. The Burmese often don robes for a few years, living without money and in a temple complex, before returning to more worldly pursuits. A monk survives by begging for alms. The latest non-violent protest has seen the clergy boycott donations from the military regime, a serious loss of face in the country. The ban extends to refusing to conduct funeral and wedding services for soldiers and their families. More than 85% of Burmese people are Buddhists, with the poor being among the most faithful adherents - because temple monks run the only schools in rural areas. Monasteries also often provide money for medicines and offer meals for the destitute. Priests have a long history of joining the country&apos;s political struggles, from the fight against British colonial rule to the pro-democracy uprising in 1988 that was crushed by the army. The impoverishment of Burma has been the spark that appears to have lit the conscience of the religious orders. Monks have demanded an instant reduction in fuel prices, the release of political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, and a swift move to democracy. Formation of the All Burma Monks Alliance, whose leadership is unknown, to head the non-violent protest is a sign that the clergy is again prepared to take on the country&apos;s leaders in the name of freedom."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/28/art.arts", "sentences": ["A branch of its educational institute is opening in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-27T23:09:12Z", "title": "The Friday interview: Robin Woodhead", "tags": ["Business", "Art", "Culture", "The art market"], "article": "A 1978 self-portrait by Francis Bacon was sold in June for \u00a321.5m at Sotheby&apos;s to an anonymous American collector. Eventually, the oil painting will find its way to its new owner but until then, the striking work, with Bacon sitting cross-legged and contemplative against a lilac backdrop, is hanging in the office of Sotheby&apos;s boss, Robin Woodhead. &quot;I am like a foster parent,&quot; he says, with obvious pleasure. &quot;This is one of the great joys of the job. &quot;I am exposed to some of the world&apos;s greatest treasures and I am never going to be able to afford to own those pieces but I am very happy to be alongside them. It is an enormous privilege.&quot; The painting is one of 20 or so self-portraits that Bacon produced after he claimed to have run out of subjects. &quot;People have been dying around me like flies,&quot; he once said. It went for twice its estimate and was one of the highlights of a summer that helped the auction house to its best-ever performance. Sotheby&apos;s made more money ($132m, or \u00a365m) in the first six months than it has made in a full year. In fact, records fell everywhere. Contemporary sales through London doubled during the summer compared with the previous year. In a record haul for a work by a living artist, Damien Hirst&apos;s Lullaby Spring, a cabinet of pills, sold for \u00a39.6m through Sotheby&apos;s on the same night as the Bacon. &quot;It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful,&quot; Woodhead says, reaching for the catalogue. Lucian Freud had held that particular record for just 24 hours when one of his paintings had sold for \u00a37.8m at the rival Christie&apos;s auction house the previous night. The day before we meet, Sotheby&apos;s announced that it had cancelled the auction for the collection of the late cellist Mstislav Rostropovich after a Russian metals magnate offered \u00a325m for the lot. It is the kind of febrile spending that has had Cassandras warning of a bubble for some time. &quot;It is very difficult for anyone to define the market they are in at any given time - what I can say is that the art market is associated generally with underlying economic trends and those same trends globally are still operating very strongly,&quot; he says. Comparisons with the art boom of the late 1980s that did come crashing down are erroneous, he says. &quot;That was more narrowly formed around the Japanese buying tastes&quot; - specifically Impressionists. Emerging markets The money now swamping top auction houses is coming from a far wider range of collectors, many of them new to the market; from the wealth being created among hedge fund and private equity managers in London and New York to newly minted billionaires in emerging markets such as China, Russia, India and the Gulf. Sotheby&apos;s has this year opened offices in Beijing and Moscow to work with local collectors or sellers. A branch of its educational institute is opening in Singapore. &quot;Endless waves of different groups of people come through here,&quot; he says. &quot;The hedge fund managers have made huge fortunes and inevitably find their way to the art market but they are just part of a group of new people who have arrived in the market. If you compare with our client list from 10 years ago, I suspect 60% would be new to us now, and you know we have clients from all over the world, and I mean all over the world, that we never knew before.&quot; Part of the attraction of auctions for new collectors is that they provide a transparent measure of the value of an art work, as well as giving the reassurance that they are buying something wanted by others. Sotheby&apos;s has been steadily removing low-end sales, closing an auction house in Olympia offering collectables, to focus on the high-end at New Bond Street and give the bigger collectors a better service. It costs the same to handle an object that sells for \u00a3200 as it does for one selling for \u00a32,000, Woodhead says. But I wonder, with all this new money pouring in, whether the art world has become, well, a little vulgar? &quot;I don&apos;t think it is any different,&quot; he says. &quot;There are endless examples of the American railroad barons, the South African mining magnates, the British industrialists, the British mercantilists of the 18th century of &apos;buy me some art&apos;. People have accumulated art because it signifies status; it makes people feel very good about themselves; it generates intellectual and emotional interest ... and it is also an investment for some people, so I think that, yes at one level it is vulgar, but we should celebrate that and there has always been an element of vulgarity in it. But there are also the other aspects that are just as valid, which is that people have a genuine collecting interest in art which makes our business very exciting.&quot; Woodhead&apos;s own enthusiasm for art is evident. The rest of the works hanging in his office are his own. He has a series of abstract paintings by the London artist GL Brierley that have an organic, science-fiction quality to them and says he recently visited her studio in Hoxton. &quot;She was doing quite a lot of figurative work and then went back to Goldsmiths to unlearn figurative, so she could start to be more expansive. I think they are rather wonderful.&quot; There is also an edition of the Map of an Englishman by the cross-dressing British artist Grayson Perry; an absurd oversize vase stuffed with paintbrushes sculpted from wood by the Italian Livio de Marchi and a small work by the Israeli artist Zadok Ben-David - a much larger version of which is on display at Chatsworth House, the second sale of sculpture organised at the stately home by Sotheby&apos;s. Woodhead has lately been collecting American photography from the 1950s and 60s. &quot;It is a much less explored area and you can still get interesting finds and opportunities. It is not so completely worked over.&quot; Born in Ireland, Woodhead was raised in what was then Rhodesia, &quot;the rather last desperate days&quot; of British colonialism, and arrived in London at 23, in the early 1970s. He worked in the City and was a founding member of the oil futures market; he also ran his own stockbroking and investment banking firm and headed the London Commodities Exchange. At the same time he was discovering the emerging London art scene in the then derelict Docklands, making friends with artists and becoming a fixture at openings. Woodhead is immaculately turned out, with public school good looks and a crisp accent, although not at all stuffy. Were the artists wary of this City gent? &quot;I never thought of it like that. I think the great thing about artists is that they are just human beings like every other human being. I never felt patronised. It was simply a world I engaged in. It is often the artists who are the nicest, most down-to-earth group.&quot; He lives in south Kensington but still owns a game reserve in South Africa. Woodhead&apos;s first formal role in art was as a director of the Whitechapel Art Gallery Foundation. He joined Sotheby&apos;s in 1998 and today is chief executive of the international division, running the business in Europe and Asia. He is also a governor of the South Bank Centre, which includes the Hayward Gallery and the Royal Festival Hall. In the past decade, he says, London has become &quot;the other great centre for art&quot; alongside New York, partly because it is becoming the global commercial capital and also because of the growing taste for contemporary work in Britain. There has been grumbling that the soaring price of art at auction is putting it out of reach of museums and publicly funded galleries; works are shifting back into the private realm. &quot;If anything the public is more likely to see them,&quot; he says, referring to a recent article in an art magazine on new privately owned galleries, including one opened by the singer George Michael in Dallas. Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics magnate who paid $135m for a Gustav Klimt work last year, has the painting on display at his Neue Galerie in New York. More visible &quot;Ten years ago in our salerooms we wanted to know exactly which museums were going to be bidding and today it is private individuals bidding, but more often than not, these works of art are much more visible than in previous years. Because of the role that art plays in people&apos;s lives, there is a great desire for people - for their friends to see it, for exhibitions, to have it on loan - so there is a great movement of art around the world, I think more than there has ever been ... art has become much more central to culture. &quot;If you think about how people&apos;s spare time is spent today there are far more people who are interested in art and the language of art. I was talking to a man who was a collector in the midwest and he said, today, in the country club, which is the centre of life in those places, people just talk about what pictures they bought. &quot;Art, certainly 100 years ago, was considered an activity of the privileged, whereas today it is much more accessible. Just look at television and the role of artists in the media.&quot; They are celebrities, I suggest, even more so in Britain, where Tracey Emin and Hirst are household names, than anywhere else. &quot;That is true,&quot; he says. &quot;But I think that says something rather good about this country.&quot; The CV Born April 28 1951, Dublin, Ireland Education Mount Pleasant school, Salisbury, Rhodesia; University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Career 1980-86, managing director Premier Man; 1980-86, chairman of International Petroleum Exchange; 1986-91, chief executive, National Investment Group; 1992-97, chief executive, London Commodity Exchange; 1998-2000, chief executive, Sotheby&apos;s Europe and Asia; 2000-, chief executive, Sotheby&apos;s International Family Divorced, no children Interests Skiing, riding, Zululand farmer"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/sep/28/burmaprotestsfriday", "sentences": ["3.15pm While the protests continue, it appears the Burmese prime minister, Soe Win, could still be in hospital in Singapore.", "21.02: One Singaporean was injured by rubber bullets."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-28T07:27:07Z", "title": "Burma protests: Friday", "tags": ["World news", "Protest"], "article": "Pro-democracy demonstrators continue to defy the authorities in Burma for an 11th consecutive day.

There have been reports of infighting among the army.   Scroll down and refresh for updates, reaction, and your chance to comment. 8.30am (BST) The deaths of at least nine people yesterday has done little to snuff out the flames of protest as demonstrators take to the streets of Rangoon for an 11th consecutive day. People are hurling abuse at the army, Reuters wire service reports, in the city centre and taking refuge in side alleys as troops feign charges. Men were shouting at the soldiers in English:   &quot;Fuck you. Go fuck yourself.&quot;  Trucks of soldiers and riot police have been sealing off the centre of the city, near the Sule Pagoda area, Reuters says, moving wooden and barbed-wire barricades block by block.  9am The Associated Press is reporting that troops have occupied key Buddhist monasteries to confine monks. A British journalist, Rosalind Russel, who is in Burma, has told Sky News that there is speculation that the monks may no longer be there. There are reports that they have been bused out of the city. The authorities also appear to have taken measures to cut Burma&apos;s internet connection with the outside world.  &quot;We have been told that the internet is down for maintenance. There is only one server in the country so when it the internet cannot be accessed,&quot; Rosalind said. 9.05am At least one shot was fired as soldiers charged chanting protesters in central Rangoon today, sending people scurrying for cover down side alleys, a witness has told Reuters. Crowds several hundred strong were taunting soldiers sealing off the area around the Sule Pagoda. 9.20am A different view comes from Andrew Kirkwood who is in Rangoon for Save the Children. He told Sky News that his office is about a mile from the Shwedagon pagoda and has not seen any signs of widspread protests.  &quot;Buses are running and schools are open. Outside of these so-called danger zones, life continues relatively normally.&quot; He confirmed that internet and email access went down at around 10.30am (5amBST) and haven&apos;t been restored. 10am Guardian Unlimited reported yesterday that elements within the Burmese army appeared to be siding with the protesting monks. Today there are reports, picked up by moeyyo.com, that one section of the military is fighting another. According to the unconfirmed reports:  Soldiers between Light Battalion 33 and 99 are fighting.    10.30am Preetam Rai writes that the 33 batalion allowed monks to continue their protests in Mandalay, Burma&apos;s second city, yesterday. That may provide a clue to what&apos;s behind the reported fighting between the 33 and 99. I&apos;ve yet to see reports of any army casualties or hear how widespread army disquiet might be - do let me know if you&apos;re aware of any details. 11am The Thai government, which has kept quiet in recent days about the problems in neighbouring Burma, is coming under pressure to take a stance, the Bangkok Post reports. Laddawan Tantiwittayapitak, of Amnesty International Thailand and the Campaign for Democracy in Burma, called on the Thai government to suspended the construction of a hydropower dam and a gas purchase contract.  11.15am Here&apos;s a taste of what Niknayman is reporting (the times are local, 5hrs30mins ahead of BST and the text has been translated for GU by Mai Aung): 8:56: According to an eye witness, last night at South Ukkalapa, young and middle age men including monks were arrested and taken away with 37 trucks. 8:57: Last night, the abbot Moe Kaung Sayadaw of Yankin monastery passed away because of violent raid happened at the monastery. 9:04: Last night, 300 monks from Daw pone were arrested. 9:18: Division 33 army force refused to shoot the people in Mandalay. The government ordered Division. 33 to move out of Mandalay but they refused to follow the order. 9:29: The soldiers traced the media people. Yesterday the computers at Traders Hotel and Sakura Hotle were checked by soldiers. 11:45: Last night 40 monks were arrested in Mandalay. 11:50: About ten thousand people gathered near Traders hotel in downtown Rangoon. 12:00: started shooting at North Ukkalapa. 12:49: As division 33 did not follow the order, the government sent division 99 by airplane to Yangon. 12:55: about 50,000 gathered at Thein Gyi Zay (market). 12:56: Division 66 in North Ukkalapa teamed up with the people. 13:01: There was confrontation and clash between Division 33 and Division 99 13:13: About 10,000 people are gathering at Sanpya market. 14:35: At Anawratha street in downtown, people and soldiers got into brawl and now shooting started at Sanpya market.  14:36: Soldiers beaten the teachers in North Ukkalapa who organized the crowd for demonstration.  15:01: It is hard to communicate now as some of the telephone lines were cut off.  11.30am Australia&apos;s ambassador to Burma, Bob Davis, has told ABC (mp3) that a &quot;signifantly&quot; larger number of people had been killed than the 10 acknowledged by the Burmese authoritities. He said the real number of those killed in yesterday&apos;s violence was likely to be &quot;several multiples of 10&quot;.  The regime has done nothing other than to inflame the demonstrators. The violence against the crowds and assaults of a large number of monastries, severe beatings of monks and arrests of hundreds of monks ... has done nothing other than isolate some of the communities of monks ... It is very tense.  12.15pm The Burma Facebook group, which now has close to 90,000 members, is developing into a self-contained Wiki with details about global protests and Burmese media lists.  12.45pm Thanks to Chisinthemorning for the comment below linking to the Democratic Voice of Burma account of locals defending monasteries against army raids.  Troops approaching the monasteries backed off after seeing people from the surrounding areas armed with sticks and slingshots preparing to stop them.  1.15pm We&apos;ve updated our interactive of events in Burma, by the way. The bloggers are struggling to get their message out today, following the attempts to close down the internet. Ko Htike, based in London, however, says he is determined to feed pictures of events to the outside world.   2.30pm Some more translation from Niknaynam, courtesy of Mai Aung: 16:30: In Mandalay there are more than 100, 000 and military stepped back. No gun shots yet. 16:42: According eye witnesses, there were pools of blood in Pansodan street. The person must be beaten by an iron bar.  16:47: Latest news: ICRC (International Committee of Red Cross) took to the streets to help the injured. 17:05: In Mandalay, 30,000 people joined 200 monks that are protesting at 31 street. Soldiers begged the monks to go back to monasteries.  18:22: Police station at South Ukkalapa was burnt down.  A woman interviewed by Sky News has suggested the deathtoll among monks is close to 200. That is consistent with the number being given by the Facebook group. It is not yet clear, however, where these reports are coming from or what they are based upon.   2.45pm Japan&apos;s prime minister Yasuo Fukuda today demanded that Burmese authorities give a full explanation of the shooting dead of a Japanese journalist during protests yesterday. I&apos;ve been looking at a video which appears to show the moment the journalist was shot. Even at slow motion and under zoom, it&apos;s not clear cut - to me at any rate - whether the killer is the soldier closest to the journalist or whether the shot is fired from further away. Not that that changes the fact that he was shot dead. 3pm A Japanese news channel has secured footage of the shooting from a different angle. The soldier closest to the victim does appear to have fired the shot. 3.15pm While the protests continue, it appears the Burmese prime minister, Soe Win, could still be in hospital in Singapore. According to the Straight Times - spotted by Kadaung, AFP reporters made an attempt to track him down.  When an AFP reporter visited the four-bed VIP room where he was listed as staying, a nurse said Soe Win was not there. A board showed the names of patients in the room, but all were Chinese. One bed was sealed off with a curtain.  The BBC reported in March that the prime minister was admitted into hospital, possibly suffering from leukaemia. 4pm Reuters is suggesting a series of scenarios of how the situation in Burma may play out over the coming days, ranging from a military crackdown to people power toppling the junta ... or something in between. 4.15pm The Irrawaddy is suggesting that the army disquiet about how to handle the protests goes right to the top.  Unconfirmed reports say there are unusual troop movements underway in Rangoon, amid reports that Snr-Gen Than Shwe, the junta&apos;s chief, and Vice Snr-Gen Maung Aye, his second in command and the commander in chief of the army, have disagreed over the response to the recent demonstrations.  Maung Aye is planning to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and is disturbed by the bloody crackdown, diplomatic sources have told the Irrawaddy. It adds that Suu Kyi has been taken to Yemon Military Camp on the outskirts of Rangoon. 5pm We&apos;re well into the curfew now so things should be quiet theoretically, but our translator Mai has just sent this through. 21.01: At this time, the military are coming to seal the Barkayar and the Aung Mingalar monasteries. 21.02: One Singaporean was injured by rubber bullets. 21.29: Soldiers are raiding the monasteries and have started shooting onlookers. 5.30pm Mizzima News carries more details about the apparent rift between the junta chief Than Shwe and his second in command Maung Aye. &quot;Maung Aye and his loyalists are opposed to shooting into the crowd,&quot; a source close to the military hierarchy told Mizzima."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/28/aninternationalcrisis", "sentences": ["Blame here rests with Singapore - which has provided medical treatment for the leaders and accepted their lucrative bank accounts.", "Perhaps more than China or any other ally of Burma, Singapore has been the closest personal friend to the SPDC leadership, as the premier shopping destination for the junta leadership and their families.", "It is essential that Singapore uses these personal ties to send a message that the need for dialogue is urgent."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-28T08:00:16Z", "title": "An international crisis", "tags": ["China", "Russia", "US news", "Oil", "Energy", "Europe", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "Now that the Burmese military is cracking down on protesters, and reports of murdered monks have come to light, it is time to take stock of who is responsible for the current crisis. Certainly, blame rests squarely with the country&apos;s junta, or State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), led by Senior General Than Shwe. His decisions to increase fuel prices served as the catalyst for these protests, which are as much about economic hardship as they are about political despotism. But international actors also need to be called to task for allowing this situation to develop. Attention has centred on China. Rightly so. China has been Burma&apos;s key ally - its &quot;big brother&quot;, to use the local parlance. The Burmese regime has used Chinese weapons and funds to maintain stability in its sensitive southern border, secure oil and gas reserves, expand access to markets and set up military facilities in its southern islands. China, meanwhile, has vetoed measures against Burma in multinational organisations including the UN security council. In return, it has gained the premier position in accessing Burmese resources, and created conditions that enhance the development and security of its western provinces. But China is not alone. India has also worked actively to buttress the regime over the past few years in order to secure its own supplies of oil and gas (though its efforts to do so have been largely unsuccessful). Russia has had more luck, gaining access to oil wealth in exchange for training, arms and a key UN security council veto. The list of countries that have sold their principles of responsible governance for oil and gas also includes South Korea and Malaysia. The latter&apos;s Petronas investments in Burma make the recent critical remarks of its foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, look hollow. There are real conflicts of interests here that need to be addressed. And governments who invest in the oil and gas sector - at its foundation a long-term investment with high capital expenditure - need to assess what their long-term interests really are. Do they want to work with a leadership that is increasingly isolated and unpopular, or do they push for dialogue? Chinese leaders, at least, may recognize that Than Shwe&apos;s actions over the last few years have fostered greater instability. An unstable Burma is not in their interests. The closer they get to the source of the instability, the more they put themselves at risk in the long term. The groundswell of opposition to the regime in the current crisis has shown the international community how deeply felt is the disdain toward the SPDC. The Chinese know more than anyone that fear is not enough to maintain power: reform is crucial. And the first step in the reform process is dialogue. In the last year, as China has shown that it is willing to take steps toward being a responsible member of the international community, its relationship with Burma has become a bit greyer. They have called the Burmese on the serious problems of drug trafficking, human trafficking and HIV/Aids, which are extending out from Burma into China. They have worked to encourage greater economic development by supporting infrastructure projects (though not all of these - such as the proposed dams in the northern Kachin state - have been carried out responsibly). And, most importantly, they have worked to expand dialogue not only with different parts of the regime but also between the regime and the international community. This summer, the Chinese hosted a dialogue with military leaders and international representatives, including those from the US. It is these more responsible initiatives that need to be harnessed and encouraged, especially as China moves towards the Olympics. The Bush administration must also appreciate that its use of sanctions has backfired, helping to strengthen the regime rather than weaken it. The US position is based on moral outrage and is tied to strong support for the Nobel prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi. She is the leader of the National League of Democracy, the party elected in 1990, and is a symbol of hope for most Burmese. But condemning the Burmese government for its human rights abuses has served only to provoke a nationalist response - and violence - and allowed the regime to deflect blame for the hardships felt by Burmese citizens from the regime to the US. Indeed, the SPDC has used sanctions as a tool to win international support. In a climate where US heavyhandedness in places such as Iraq has alienated some countries, the Burmese government has reached out to potential allies. None of its regional neighbours effectively supported US sanctions, and the regime&apos;s leaders found means to get around them: putting their funds in banks in friendly countries and shopping in Asia rather than in the west. Sanctions by a few countries alone cannot work. In Burma, they have not worked beyond extending symbolic support for the opposition; they have yet to promote the most urgent step: dialogue. This is why US policy has taken a noticeable shift this week. Yes, George Bush did introduce new sanctions on Tuesday. But they are substantively different in tone from earlier measures. Recognising that they will depend on the support and cooperation of other countries to be effective, the Bush administration&apos;s policy on Burma has evolved into one of greater international cooperation - a point Bush emphasised in his speech at the UN. Allies such as China are given more space to act. It remains to be seen whether they will take up this mantle, but the move toward multilateral action should be commended. In reaching out to the international community, there needs to be an appreciation of who has provided quiet sanctuary to the regime&apos;s leaders. Blame here rests with Singapore - which has provided medical treatment for the leaders and accepted their lucrative bank accounts. Perhaps more than China or any other ally of Burma, Singapore has been the closest personal friend to the SPDC leadership, as the premier shopping destination for the junta leadership and their families. It is essential that Singapore uses these personal ties to send a message that the need for dialogue is urgent. The crisis in Burma is truly an international one, and the actors responsible extend beyond the country&apos;s borders. How it will evolve will depend on the international community adopting new tactics. The US has changed its position; other parties need to do so as well. Only by taking stock of who is responsible and adopting new initiatives can bloodshed be limited and real dialogue begin."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/28/letsgetserious", "sentences": ["Singapore - with many investments in Burma - has expressed &quot;revulsion &quot; over the military killings, but it has said nothing about the substance of what it will do to solve the current crisis."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-28T13:30:00Z", "title": "Let's get serious", "tags": ["South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "After 10 days of bravery and defiance against a military regime ferociously clinging on to power, the bloodied monks and battered demonstrators of Burma are now looking to the world community to act decisively, and put a brake on the killings of the junta. Quiet diplomacy, constructive engagement and all those other euphemisms have totally failed. The European Union&apos;s highly limited sanctions have been constantly fudged in discussions between the EU and Asean (of which Burma is a member). Now, with the world&apos;s presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers gathering at the UN in New York for the annual session of the General Assembly, there is a unique opportunity to redress the appalling legacy of half-baked sanctions since the last bloodbath by this same regime in 1988. This time it has to be different, and with several major countries changing their positions, there is hope that global anger may yet find some serious follow-through by a concert of nations. The US government has already announced some measures: specifically asset freezes and visa bans on members of the military regime. On Thursday the US Treasury gave details of the 14 Burmese leaders affected, including Gen Than Shwe, minister of defence and chairman of the ruling State Peace and Development Council. Those who say sanctions have failed forget that only a few countries have ever signed up to modest sanctions. Their limited effects have been torpedoed by the commercial greed of China, India and Asean countries, far more intent on plundering Burma&apos;s vast natural resources in profitable rather than in constructive engagement (see www.altsean.org - the Alternative Asean Network on Burma). French President Nicholas Sarkozy has called upon French oil giant Total to stop any further investment in Burma. In previous EU sessions France was the biggest opponent of effective sanctions. Foreign minister Bernard Kouchner is now in favour of Total withdrawing from Burma. A tougher EU stand would set a benchmark for other nations, the especially Asean countries, which are increasingly embarrassed to be hosting a monster in their midst. Singapore - with many investments in Burma - has expressed &quot;revulsion &quot; over the military killings, but it has said nothing about the substance of what it will do to solve the current crisis. Senior generals in the current Thai government are also deeply compromised by their investments in Burma&apos;s natural gas, telecoms, and projects to build dams across the Salween River. The EU &apos;s investments are marginal to the bankrolling of the Burmese generals. However, tough European sanctions could be used to shame Asean countries into freezing their far more significant investments, given the strong political, diplomatic and trade nexus between the EU and Asean. If Asean is moved to adopt a tougher policy, then this is bound to have a knock-on effect on China, the main bulwark for the junta&apos;s survival. Chinese tanks, guns and bullets have built up a huge expansion of the Burmese armed forces since 1988. Russia has sold them jet fighters and will build a nuclear reactor, but China is by far the country&apos;s biggest investor in oil, natural gas and infrastructure. According to EarthRights International, a crucial project of Chinese multinationals established in Myanmar has been the construction of a 2,380-km oil and gas pipeline from the Arakan coast to Yunnan province in China. But Beijing is far from happy with the behaviour of the regime and is very much aware of international condemnation. Chinese diplomats are worried that instability in Burma could pose a threat to their many interests. China&apos;s calls for restraint indicate a growing anxiety about the future of the regime. The stakes are high, given that China&apos;s role in Burma is crucial to its energy-hungry economy. China needs the pipeline and a vital port in Myanmar for its growing energy imports from the Middle East, Africa and Venezuela. Australian academic Desmond Ball has also revealed in Burma&apos;s Military Secrets that the two countries are intimately linked by a $1.5bn high-tech electronic-warfare project of the junta&apos;s leader, psychological-warfare specialist General Than Shwe. It deals with surveillance of ethnic-minority guerrillas in Myanmar - the Karen, the Chan, the Wa, among others. It deals with surveillance of strategic competitor India. And it deals with surveillance of all naval traffic in the Indian Ocean, US warships included, not to mention the crucial Strait of Malacca. Beijing wants the killing to stop, not in the name of human rights but for the sake of stability. But China and Russia do not want to see any regime change - either the eventual toppling of the Burmese generals or an implosion of the junta. A triumph of Buddhist-inspired people power might encourage Buddhists in Tibet and Falungong militants in China to defy the communist party control and Beijing&apos;s repression. Still, China is in a bind as Burma conjures up memories of the Tiananmen Square killings just Beijing is preparing to host the Olympics. A repeat of the 1988 massacre in Rangoon when at least 3,000 pro-democracy activists were gunned down in the street, would cast a dark shadow over China&apos;s desire to be treated as a responsible global power. While China will not back any sanctions, it is open to increasing diplomatic pressure to stop the killings, and the junta can ill afford to ignore the anxieties of its number one benefactor. The US and the EU have many avenues to pressure both China and Asean, even up to the point of threatening a boycott of the Beijing Olympics. A simple threat by Beijing to suspend all arms supplies to Rangoon would deliver the only kind of message that the generals might finally understand. The time of western countries and Asean paying polite lip-service to human rights and release of national heroine Aung san Suu kyi, still languishing under house arrest, is over. The coming weeks will soon demonstrate how many governments will put human rights and the plight of the Burmese before commercial advantage, trading priorities and comfort zone diplomacy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/sep/30/escape.mytravels", "sentences": ["When you&apos;re flying from London to Singapore, it&apos;s not that much more to add to the cost of the flight."], "publicationDate": "2007-09-29T23:36:41Z", "title": "Me and my travels", "tags": ["Travel"], "article": "My idea of paradise is ...

When I first found out the subject of his latest expos\u00e9, I thought: do we really need another film about Beverly Hills weirdos with faces so stretched they look like they&apos;re permanently staggering through a wind tunnel? It feels to me like there is one on TV just about every week. Then I remembered. This is Louis Theroux we&apos;re talking about: a journalist so fearless, he hung out with Christine Hamilton when she was tipsy. He&apos;s bound to have some exciting new angle. So when I finally settle down to watch it, I feel quite content, though I have a notebook handy with which to obscure my face should I have to watch any nipples being removed. Alas, the first half of the film is predictable, depressingly so. In Beverly Hills - told you - Theroux meets several cosmetic surgeons and their clients. The cosmetic surgeons (all male) are loud, pushy and obsessed with the excellence of their handiwork. Their clients fall into two camps. In one corner, we have the addicts; it starts with a humble nose job and before you know it, they&apos;re having squishy implants inserted under any available flap of skin, like cloves of garlic going into a leg of lamb. Theroux meets one, a German called Adrian; unfortunately, his right pectoral implant has slipped cartoonishly to one side of his body. Theroux points this out, but Adrian is not fussed; better a wonky implant than no implant. In the other corner are those who feel they can only truly be happy if they look like a film star. Theroux meets a young woman whose relationship has recently ended. He sees her before her surgery - a brow lift, boob job and liposuction - and after. Before, she cries at her own lack of self-esteem. After, she cries with happiness at her new glammy self. As Theroux looks on, the ex-boyfriend stops by. Yikes. If this were Pimp My Ride, the guy&apos;d be honking his horn with happiness. But perhaps, as he was making this film, Theroux realised that the territory was all too familiar, because he suddenly decides to have some work done himself. One of his new surgeon friends marks up his torso with a black magic marker and tells the presenter that he is a good candidate for liposuction. So he has his fat vacuumed out while he is under local anaesthetic - 500cc of the stuff - which he examines later, when it has been collected in a clear pot (it&apos;s the spooky orange colour of fish fingers). &apos;It&apos;s like you&apos;re scrubbing me with a brush from the inside,&apos; he says, in a small voice as the procedure is carried out. Afterwards, he has to wear a surgical corset that has been padded with six panty liners to prevent any &apos;tumescent fluid&apos; from leaking out of the holes where the tubes were inserted. Later, we see the result: his stomach and back do look tighter but, personally, I mourn the passing of his comfy little belly and I&apos;d be willing to be bet that you will too, girls, when you see the programme. Some men are not designed to be lean, mean fighting machines and Louis Theroux, with his floppy hair and his marmoset eyes, is one of them. When Theroux arrives at the Covent Garden hotel where we&apos;re meeting, he is bearded, which isn&apos;t very LA, but he definitely looks trim about the middle. So it really worked? &apos;It looks... objectively... better,&apos; he says uncertainly (in conversation, he seems very uncertain, and I can&apos;t tell if it&apos;s an affectation or not; today, he&apos;s also claiming mild illness and has just fixed himself what looks like an Alka-Seltzer). &apos;It hasn&apos;t even reached its optimum yet. It takes about a year [for the full effect]. I had it done in February. They say it&apos;s about correcting disproportionality, but where are the men who don&apos;t get a slight paunch? I haven&apos;t met any.&apos; He puts his hands on his waist. &apos;Anyway, they said, &quot;This is it for life! You&apos;ll never get a paunch!&quot;&apos; What if he drank eight pints of Guinness every night for the next year? &apos;It goes somewhere ... else.&apos; Where? &apos;It is evenly distributed around your body. But I&apos;m not sure that I believe that. I&apos;m worried it&apos;ll go here.&apos; He moves his hands up to his chest. Oh no! Man breasts! &apos;Ye-aah....&apos; At what point in the making of the film did he decide to have work done himself? &apos;I always like to try to get involved. When the specialist said I&apos;d be a good candidate, I was surprised. I thought I wouldn&apos;t need anything. But I hadn&apos;t exercised in a couple of weeks because I hadn&apos;t been feeling well, so I&apos;d maybe put on five pounds. Also, I think he was drumming up business a bit. I think he&apos;d find almost no one who couldn&apos;t use a bit of lipo, though I didn&apos;t think about that at the time. He said I needed it and he seemed quite plausible. I have mixed feelings about it. My girlfriend didn&apos;t seem that thrilled with it. She thought I shouldn&apos;t get it. But in the scheme of things, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s too much to worry about.&apos; He made himself so vulnerable, though, the doctor merrily taking photographs of his baggy bits. &apos;Yeah, there was stuff where I looked like a pathetic old man, which we cut out. It was tragic.&apos; His film makes cosmetic surgery seem the exclusive province of the lost and the lonely, but he is unwilling to condemn its rapacious culture. &apos;I don&apos;t see it necessarily as a pathology,&apos; he says. &apos;We&apos;re all in it up to a point. An expectation has been visited on us of how we&apos;re supposed to look by TV and magazines. We all have the idea that we should look better than our natural endowment allows us to look.&apos; Theroux&apos;s cosmetic surgery film perfectly illustrates the corner he is currently in as a presenter. Thanks to his documentaries about Jimmy Savile, Paul Daniels and Ann Widdecombe, I imagine it&apos;s probably fairly difficult for him to get access to both people and situations in this country or, at least, the right kind of access (who, now, is going to invite Louis into their bedroom?). So he must work in America. The trouble is, even the US doesn&apos;t always produce crazy enough stuff to satisfy the expectations of a generation of viewers raised on reality TV. He, however, denies this is the case. &apos;The subjects I&apos;m interested in are quite extreme. They&apos;re so far beyond the pale of normal human interaction that you&apos;re never going to get a reality show on that territory.&apos; Does he work in the US because he can no longer do so here? &apos;It may be partly that. It&apos;s not the whole story. I haven&apos;t analysed it that much and I&apos;m almost frightened to analyse it too much. There&apos;s a sense of cultural difference between us and America and part of what I enjoy is being put into that environment. In Britain, I was doing ones about well-known people. I wanted to be enveloped in their sense of self and that seemed to work well. If I made a programme in Britain about non-famous people, I don&apos;t know if that would work. The subjects tend to be bigger in America.&apos; His own fame, such as it is, makes him uncomfortable. When he was making a film about Max Clifford, the celebrity PR lured him to Spearmint Rhino on a false pretext and made sure that the Mirror was there to record Theroux&apos;s supposed fondness for lapdancing clubs. &apos;I didn&apos;t like it. Even working in the media, I&apos;m surprised when untrue things get printed. One of the online scandal mail-outs [recently] ran a story: &quot;He says he hasn&apos;t had cosmetic surgery before, but, in fact, he&apos;s had his ears pinned back.&quot;&apos; A lie? He pokes at an ear. Yes, a lie, obviously. He&apos;s always accused of being a faux-naif - his interview style is nine parts Mrs Merton to one part William Brown - but when you ask how much is acting, and how much is him, he claims to find the question silly. &apos;I&apos;m in a professional situation, so that&apos;s not me. The everyday me is not someone who&apos;d say to Debbie McGee [Mrs Paul Daniels], &quot;Why haven&apos;t you had children?&quot; It would be intrusive. I&apos;m trying to do a job and part of that is asking questions that may seem insensitive and not stepping on the answers. If that&apos;s construed as wide-eyed innocence, so be it.&apos; Does part of him think of his interviewees: well, they&apos;ve agreed to this, so if they don&apos;t like it, that&apos;s their look-out? &apos;You have to be ethical and straightforward but also make people comfortable enough to be themselves. If they take issue with the way I portray them - but I feel that how I portray them is how they are - I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a problem. Sometimes, people have a different idea of who they are from who they really are. That&apos;s when feelings get hurt. But I don&apos;t think being a journalist in any way absolves you of the obligation to be a decent human being.&apos; All this is fascinating, especially in the context of our meeting. He is charming, in a donnish way, but a nightmare to interview. He makes a big deal out of answering the most banal questions, to the point where you think that the question wasn&apos;t banal after all and he has some dark secret to hide (this is silly: for years, he refused to explain why he always referred to the woman who was his wife as his girlfriend, until one day, after the marriage was over, he admitted that they had mainly got hitched so she could get a job in the US, where he was then working). He often lets silence fill up the room. Worst of all, he does this patronising successful-TV-interviewer-to-rubbish-newspaper-interviewer thing where, having initially pretended not to understand a question, he&apos;ll say something like: &apos;OK, to throw you a bone ...&apos; While it doesn&apos;t exactly make him a hypocrite, it is pretty rich coming from a man who asked Ann Widdecombe whether she was a virgin. I suspect his attitude to publicity is connected to his childhood, when he was growing up with his famous and sometimes indiscreet father, Paul Theroux: I think he needs publicity in some way, but that he is also disgusted by this need, perhaps even fears it. When Louis was a child, the family - he has an older brother, Marcel, who writes novels - lived in Wandsworth (his mother worked at the BBC World Service). The boys were weekly boarders at Westminster School. Why? Their home was only the other side of the river. &apos;We asked to be. We&apos;d read St Clare&apos;s and Mallory Towers [Enid Blyton school stories] and we thought it would be all midnight feasts. When you were a boarder, you definitely felt superior to the day boys: &quot;You&apos;re going home now, but we&apos;re... hardcore. The party continues.&quot;&apos; His next film is about San Quentin prison and the relationships between the prisoners there - intense, even romantic - reminded him of boarding school &apos;in a way&apos;. His father&apos;s work notoriously blurs the line between fact and fiction and, in the past, Theroux has said how weird it was to be 12 and reading about your dad smoking opium and hanging with prostitutes. Was he aware of his father&apos;s fame as a boy? He thinks for what seems like ages. &apos;I was aware that he was a writer, but you know what? Writing is not like being a footballer or a DJ. It doesn&apos;t really impinge on the lives of children. It didn&apos;t mean anything to my peer group.&apos; But is there a connection between the fact that he grew up with a father who had a public profile and his own adult interest in a certain kind of celebrity? &apos;I don&apos;t want to go down this route, because it&apos;s so speculative. The act of self-analysis is a no-win thing because it looks narcissistic or it leads to unwelcome revelations. But I think it&apos;s more the case that my dad, being a complex character who inhabits a number of different personas, has made it comfortable for me to be around those people. It may be that it has made me curious about people, but I also regard him as someone I&apos;ve always been curious about.&apos; Graham Greene talked of the &apos;chip of ice&apos; in the writer&apos;s heart; perhaps another thing father and son share is a certain professional ruthlessness? &apos;It&apos;s not really much different from what you do. I don&apos;t think that what I do is special. But TV keeps you honest compared with print journalism. It&apos;s a lot harder to massage a quote.&apos; His parents divorced after their sons had left home and, by all accounts, Louis found this difficult. But he remains close to both his parents and to his brother. Ah, yes. What about Marcel? I&apos;d heard that the brothers are fiercely competitive and his brother&apos;s last but one novel, The Paperchase, was about, among o ther things, sibling rivalry. &apos;We&apos;re competitive in the way that siblings are, but we&apos;re also very close. It&apos;s never come between us.&apos; Will he write a novel himself? &apos;I don&apos;t have plans to. I was brought up to believe that being a writer, a gifted writer, is the highest claim to fame. So I love the idea of having written a really good novel, but whether it&apos;s something I could do...&apos; Has he tried? &apos;No.&apos; So what will he do next? He has always presented his career in television as a kind of happy mistake - after Oxford, where he got a first, he worked at Spy magazine in the US and applied for a job working on Michael Moore&apos;s series TV Nation because he wanted to work on that particular show, not because he wanted to be on screen (though, thanks to his British accent, that is where he ended up) - and he insists there is no plan. &apos;I&apos;m surprised I&apos;m still doing it. I didn&apos;t go into it with a view to doing it for years and years.&apos; The only thing he will say is that being away from home is harder than it used to be because he and his girlfriend, Nancy, have a young son. My hunch is that he knows he can&apos;t make the kind of films he is turning out now forever (he is 37) and that perhaps his San Quentin documentary is the start of the next stage. When he talks about his prisoners and his guards, something happens. For the first time since he folded his body into the chair opposite me, he seems animated, engaged and even - steady, Louis! - a little unguarded.

Communication to the outside world has been largely cut and, according to diplomats in the region, up to 200 protesters are dead. The official death count from the government is nine. But no one believes the government. The maroon-clad Buddhist monks from the monasteries at Moe Gaung, Ngwe Kyar Yan and elsewhere, who marched in their thousands to give impetus to a new generation of Burmese protesters challenging decades of military rule, are locked up in prison or behind their monastery gates. Their monks&apos; cells have been smashed, stained with their blood and looted. Those who escaped have taken off their robes and sought refuge disguised as laymen. Parks, grocery stores and internet cafes are closed. Troops stand on every corner. By late yesterday a few hundred protesters - in contrast to the hundreds of thousands who flocked to the streets mid-week - were playing a game of cat- and-mouse with the military and pro-military thugs. For now it has been left to a United Nations envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to persuade the generals to use negotiations instead of guns to end mass protests against 45 years of military rule. &apos;He&apos;s the best hope we have. He is trusted on both sides,&apos; Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo said. &apos;If he fails, then the situation can become quite dreadful.&apos; It was a sense of despair that was reflected yesterday in Rangoon, the country&apos;s largest city and centre of gravity of the protests, which have faltered and failed under a hail of rubber bullets, tear gas and live rounds. &apos;I don&apos;t think that we have any more hope to win,&apos; said a young woman who took part in a massive demonstration on Thursday that was broken up when troops opened fire into a crowd. She was separated from her boyfriend and has not seen him since. &apos;The monks are the ones who give us courage.&apos; &apos;People are living in a state of fear and hate,&apos; said another onlooker. &apos;A few days ago, everyone was friendly. Now no one wants to talk to strangers.&apos; But, perhaps, it is not the whole picture. For in Burma in these past two weeks of protests, two stories have emerged. The first has been sharply visible in the images of the vast demonstrations against the military junta that have coalesced around Rangoon&apos;s symbolic centres of the Sule and Shwedagon pagodas, and the violent response of the regime. It has been told in pictures of bloodshed and confrontation that have brought back bleak memories of the last time the Burmese people rose up to confront the military who have exercised a brutal monopoly on power for 45 long years. That was in 1988, when 3,000 people were murdered by the army in the violence that followed. Most of all it has been a story of resistance that yesterday appeared to have concluded in defeat. But there has been a second, more discreet story that has emerged. The most powerful weapons in the revolution, albeit one that has been crushed for now, were the worldwide web, Facebook and the blogs - in particular, those that fed the Burmese media network in Oslo that fed the world. With the internet in Burma largely closed down, as activists in Norway concede, the powerful images that commanded the world&apos;s attention have become scraps of just a few seconds. Still, the story has seeped out via hurried conversations in Rangoon and Mandalay, passed down the line to opposition groups in exile in Bangkok and on the Thai border. And what it has described is a sclerotic military regime that, while still brutal and controlling, has been struggling to impose the power it has for so long enjoyed. It tells for the first time of cracks in the military command, of officers questioning the &apos;morality&apos; of their orders and the self-interest of the generals in charge. &apos;There are differences in the rank and file of the army for the first time,&apos; said one exiled trade union activist last week. They are focused, too, on tensions within an army and bureaucracy that has long shared the financial fruits of power with the junta&apos;s generals and who, after four decades, have begun to feel as excluded as the vast majority of Burma&apos;s people. When Senior General Than Shwe began the relocation of Burma&apos;s administrative capital to Naypyidaw - the &apos;Abode of the Gods&apos; - in November 2005 the move was put down by some to folly and superstition. The reality, however, of the relocation of Burma&apos;s ministries and military headquarters to this area of tropical scrub, 200 miles distant from Rangoon, was more prosaic. A military dictatorship once confident of its ability to frighten the population had, in fact, become something close to being afraid itself, of its own people. It was a time of transformation in Burma - of changes that in large measure would lead directly to the showdown between the military and the Burmese people that began in the middle of August. For there were consequences to the move that the generals could have anticipated. Transferring the entire government machinery to Naypyidaw has been a huge drain on public finances already stretched to breaking point in one of the world&apos;s poorest countries. So, too, has been the cost of maintaining the 375,000-strong army, which has nearly doubled in size over the past decade. The folly of the move to Naypyidaw has impoverished an already poor population in a land where government pensions are virtually worthless. One of the critical engines of the protests has been the cost of living. The move had other critical consequences. For as well as seeing the centre of power being shifted away, the centre of gravity within the regime was also being shunted. &apos;The junta used to be a dictatorship by committee,&apos; says Mark Farmaner of the Burma Campaign UK. &apos;But around the same time as the move it began to become more of a traditional dictatorship centred around General Than Shwe. The military intelligence chief, General Khin Nyunt, was put under house arrest, and the balance of power with Vice Senior General Maung Aye that existed between the three generals began evolving around 2004 into the accumulation by Than Shwe of more power for himself and a few cronies.&apos; The shift in power within Burma&apos;s junta was reflected in another important aspect, according to opposition figures in the Burmese government in exile. Where once the generals had been careful to command the loyalty of the military by distributing the benefits of dictatorship among them, Than Shwe began concentrating the benefits of power in the same tight circle. And if a symbol for the physical remoteness and greed of the evolving new regime under Than Shwe was required, it was supplied in a desperately miscalculated act: the wedding in Rangoon last year of his daughter, a 10-minute video of which was leaked to the outside world. Viewers were offended not only by the extravagance of the event, in which Thandar Shwe and her bridegroom, Major Zaw Phyo Win, a deputy director at the Ministry of Commerce, were showered with expensive gifts, including luxury cars, houses and jewellery, but also by its utter lack of taste. It was not simply the widely claimed $50m in gifts lavished on the bride that was symbolic. The diabetic Than Shwe, then 75, looked frail. Less visible things were happening to the regime as it settled into its new headquarters. Reports of desertions from a military no longer an elite apart began to emerge; a report leaked to Jane&apos;s suggested that many of its battalions were suffering manpower problems. Persistent reports began to emerge of criticism of the leadership even among the officer classes. &apos;There was a lieutenant-colonel out of the country who said the Americans should bomb Naypyidaw,&apos; recalls Zaw Tung, an official with the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma, which was among the organisers of the recent protests and a victim of the crackdown. Signs of dissent within the military have also been reported by Zin Lin, an official with the Burmese government in exile. &apos;We have heard reports from inside the country of places where soldiers are not following orders to fire on demonstrators, including in Mandalay where they refused an order to fire on monks.&apos; But there are more intriguing claims emerging that appear to contradict the narrative of the democracy movement being snuffed out without any gain in the last few days. Among them is the claim in Irrawaddy news magazine that the bubbling dissent within the armed forces has led to a serious falling out between the head of the army, Vice Senior General Maung Aye, and Than Shwe over the response to the demonstrations. Farmaner&apos;s organisation has heard the same accounts. And if he is certain of one thing, it is that Than Shwe, secluded in his new capital, made a series of potentially disastrous miscalculations, beginning with the decision to increase the price of fuel by 500 per cent, leading to the first demonstration on 19 August. By the junta&apos;s own standards, it seemed slow and confused about how to respond to the fuel protests and then to the mass revulsion that followed the beating of two monks by the security forces. When it did use violence last week, to close the huge monasteries in Rangoon that had become the focus of the protests, arresting and beating hundreds of monks and looting property, it was in a way certain to alienate many who had not marched but stood on the sidelines in this devoutly Buddhist country. &apos;There seems to have been a massive series of miscalculations,&apos; says Farmaner. &apos;They did not anticipate how unpopular the increase in the fuel price would be.&apos; He added: &apos;The junta relies on its psychological grip on the population. It requires people to be afraid. But people kept coming out day after day. You can say that its grip is lessening.&apos; The junta has miscalculated in other ways as well. Although China last week blocked a strong resolution at the UN, it has made unusually strong remarks - strong by its diplomatic standards, that is, that have criticised its ally, perhaps mindful that in the year ahead of the Beijing Olympics it does not want to be seen as party to widespread bloodshed. The Asean nations, not prone to condemning their own over human rights abuses, have spoken of their &apos;revulsion&apos;, while Japan, the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Burma, has also apparently been galvanised against the regime after the death of a Japanese photographer. And while the junta has long ignored the condemnation of Washington and European capitals, and has survived under sanctions similar to President George Bush&apos;s new travel ban on 30 senior Burmese figures, it seems certain that local considerations will weigh more heavily. What will be most critical will be the attitude of China. For what seems important is not that China has moved slowly but that China has moved at all. On Friday, Gordon Brown telephoned his Chinese counterpart, Wen Jiabao, to ask Beijing to use its influence to prevent further bloodshed. The previous day, Mr Bush conveyed a similar message in a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Yang Jiechi. US State Department officials, it has been claimed, have privately asked China to provide a safe haven for the junta to allow progress towards a peaceful political transition. China supplies arms to Burma, part of the $1.3bn in goods it exported to its neighbour last year. China is also the main supplier of foreign goods, accounting for 34 per cent of Burma&apos;s imports. Hopes for a positive response are based on Beijing&apos;s increasingly pro-active diplomatic policy, despite usually preferring not to interfere in the affairs of other nations. There are other internal risks for the Burmese regime. Armed ethnic groups that had been on ceasefire have been outraged by the violence last week and are angry at the junta&apos;s continued intransigence in pushing forward a new constitution that has ignored their demands. So while the junta may have won for now, quite what the terms and scope of its victory are remain unclear. &apos;A Burmese said to me once that his country was hard on the outside and soft in the middle,&apos; says Farmaner. &apos;I always thought if the junta was going to go it would be like one of the Eastern European ones, imploding rather than reforming itself away.&apos; This weekend the Burmese junta does not seem necessarily stronger, only more desperate. How it started 5 August: Fuel prices rise 19 August: First protest marches in Rangoon - several dissidents arrested 21 September: Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks emerges to co-ordinate the protests 22 September: Monks let through the barricades around the home of Aung San Suu Kyi 24 September: Tens of thousands march on Rangoon. Violent clashes as protesters are set upon by police. At least three deaths 25 September: Dusk-to-dawn curfew introduced 26 September: UN urges restraint by the junta after an emergency session, in which China vetoed sanctions 27 September: At least nine are shot dead in Rangoon 28 September: Special UN envoy arrives in Rangoon Key questions Q: Why do some people call it Burma and others Myanmar? A: The ruling military junta changed the name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989, a year after up to 5,000 were killed in the suppression of a popular uprising (triggered by the government&apos;s decision to devalue the currency). Many countries and the UN accepted the name change but the UK, and opposition groups inside and outside Burma, don&apos;t recognise the legitimacy of the regime that changed the name. Q: What sparked the protests? A: On 15 August the government doubled the price of petrol and diesel, while the cost of compressed gas - used in buses - increased fivefold. It hit people hard, pushing up the cost of public transport, rice and cooking oil. Angry pro-democracy activists led the first demonstrations in Rangoon on 19 August and soon marches were being organised in several towns around the country. Q: How did Buddhist monks get involved? A: The clergy has traditionally been involved in protest movements - one of Burma&apos;s most revered historical leaders was a monk. Soldiers broke up a peaceful demo in Pakokku on 5 September, injuring three monks. The monks gave the government until 17 September to apologise and then began to protest in much greater numbers. Q: Who is Aung San Suu Kyi? A: The 62-year-old leader of the opposition National League for Democracy, which won the 1990 election by a landslide; she has spent more than 11 of the past 18 years in some form of detention. Presently under house arrest, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

We sift them, forget them, censor them and remember them. Some we fetishise. There are photographs that continue to live inside me and to belong to me in the same way paintings and movies and novels and places and people and the life I have lived do. Photography, it was said, would kill painting, or at least take over various aspects of painting&apos;s role as a record of the modern world. Painting has instead found itself in a fruitful, if frequently problematic, relationship both with photographs and with film. Photographs have become much more than a sketchbook for painters. The world as it is mediated through photography, film and video, and the ways we relate to it, have become a subject for the painter. Which in a roundabout way brings us to The Painting of Modern Life, which opens at the Hayward Gallery on Thursday. The exhibition claims to be the first &quot;museum&quot; survey to explore the use and translation of photographic imagery in painting of the past half-century. The Hayward is not a museum, but the exhibition attempts a substantial, authoritative overview, beginning with Andy Warhol&apos;s 1960s Car Crashes, Race Riots and Electric Chair, and ending in the show&apos;s last section with San Francisco photorealist Robert Bechtle&apos;s uninflected, often mesmerising images of himself and his family beside their Pontiacs and Chryslers in their sunlit 1970s suburban driveways. In between, there are more car crashes: one by Chinese painter Liu Xiaodong, painted in 2002, the painting as slick and greasy as the wet highway where the car has swerved and stopped under receding halos of yellow light; another by Eberhard Havekost, painted last year, showing a woman dead in a car, a salacious news photo manipulated with a creepy eroticism worthy of JG Ballard. In 1966, Vija Celmins painted a view of the freeway, from a photo taken through her windscreen as she drove, the camera balanced on the steering wheel. This is a tremendous painting, in which the eye travels and is stilled at the same time. And then there is Richard Hamilton&apos;s 1968-9 Swingeing London, a paparazzo&apos;s flash-bulb view into the back of the limo where gallerist Robert Fraser and Mick Jagger are being driven away after a drugs bust, the light flaring on their handcuffs, which has become more redolent of its period than the photograph that inspired it. If slavish transcription and enlargement of the photograph, however interesting the image itself, were all that painters were to concern themselves with, we needn&apos;t give them a second look. A few works here fall into this category. The best artists home in on the image and turn it into something else, however faithfully they appear to copy the photograph. One almost can&apos;t find the trace of the source photograph in the whorls of Richard Artschwager&apos;s renderings of dormitories, factories, offices and demolition sites, which are rendered on an insistently mechanically textured material. They seem to belong to a hinterland of images, somewhere between the drawn, the painted, the photographic and the printed, and are as grainy as imperfect memories. Some of the more recent painters here appear to be making a glamorous kind of decor, fetishised with paint. Judith Eisler&apos;s glossy, out-of-focus paintings, based on photographs of the TV screen while she watches Marianne Faithfull in leather gear in Girl On a Motorcycle or Ciao Manhattan, have a melted, hard quality, and appear to be all about surface, glare and a kind of repulsion. Johannes Kahrs&apos;s repainted screen grabs from Martin Scorsese&apos;s Taxi Driver, and of Jagger singing Sympathy for the Devil, have got all the right blurring and layering and juddery suffocating claustrophobia, but they end up somehow chic and self-regarding paintings, over-encumbered by technique. Maybe what they are really about is decadence, and a kind of sexualised relationship with the image. Luc Tuymans frequently works from multiple-generation photocopies or bad Polaroids, making a watercolour version of the image, then painting from that, rapidly and mercilessly homing in on the dead spots or the places where the authority of the image unravels. For Altar, depicting an altar in a Salt Lake City Mormon temple, the image was taken from a security camera shot as seen in a TV documentary, frozen as a photographic still, reworked in a watercolour that was rephotographed as a Polaroid, then painted in oil on a large scale, rapidly, using the Polaroid as a model. Tuymans has always said the montage and cropping of film are closer to painting then photography is. Martin Kippenberger, on the other hand, sent his snapshots to a sign painter to be painted in the early 1980s. &quot;I am not Paint Peter,&quot; he once said, and, &quot;I am not an easel-kisser.&quot; For Kippenberger, both the photograph and the painting are of questionable value, their relationships unsettled and still in flux. Marlene Dumas uses photographs as both subject matter and models, as does Peter Doig. Their relationship to photography might appear straightforward, using photos as models for paintings and details in paintings, just as Degas, Edward Hopper and Walter Sickert did. A painting, in any case, is more than an image or a collection of images, and the process of painting is more complicated and protracted than the camera&apos;s blink; a painting is layered in time as well as in the strata and revisions of its surface. Celmins has remarked that she likes to think: &quot;Time stops in art. When you pack a lot of time into a work something happens that slows the image down, makes it more physical, makes you stay with it.&quot; As Ralf Rugoff, the Hayward&apos;s director, acknowledges, painting is slow; and therein lies its reflexive and critical relationship to what it records. When it was practised by lesser artists, the blurring of the image in Gerhard Richter&apos;s tonal paintings based on photographs became an academic cliche, while in Richter&apos;s paintings this revision and partial cancellation of the image seemed to be about our apprehension of the image - both tantalising us with what is just out of reach, and cannot be focused on and at the same time rebuffing our insatiable urge to see, to penetrate the surface. Richter shows us, in a sense, what is indescribable. &quot;I am practising photography by other means,&quot; he once said, as if the relationship between photography and painting could be reversed. The Painting of Modern Life is timely, not least because there aren&apos;t enough exhibitions that look seriously at painting, in the light of all the other ways in which art is made now, and with which painting has always had both vexed and fruitful relationships. This is the Hayward&apos;s first big international painting show since Greg Hilty and I curated a show here in 1994. Painting always stays the same, and is always trying to reinvent itself. The Hayward is also aware that a show about painting, and kinds of painting that might be seen to aspire to the sort of &quot;realism&quot; people often mistakenly believe is signal to &quot;good painting&quot; (whatever that is), and old-style craft virtues, is likely to be popular. And David Hockney is in it, although not entirely to good effect. Because this is a show about &quot;modern life&quot; as well as the symbiotic relationship between painting and photography, it has been hung under thematic rubrics: History and Politics; Work; Leisure and Everyday Life; Social Space; Modern Individuals, Family and Friends. If nothing else, these allow paintings to have conversations, of a sort. Liu Xiaodong&apos;s Singapore transsexual smiles as she makes her way in her heels down a flight of stairs, as though on her way to meet the boy in a shower in the Hockney painting that faces her. We are in the Modern Individuals section, and might well ask what a modern individual is. It can also be an anonymous man eviscerated by light as he sits on a plane, painted by Tuymans, or a kid jumping on a bed by Havekost. Wilhelm Sasnal&apos;s graphic depiction of a metal ski-jump near Kielce in Poland - where, in 1946, 37 out of 200 returning Holocaust survivors were murdered by Poles in a horrific postwar pogrom - hangs in the Leisure and Everyday Life section. Nearby hangs another image of skiers, in suburban Canada, by Doig. They flank a very small painting of princes William and Harry at an Arsenal game, by Elizabeth Peyton, derived from a Daily Telegraph photo taken soon after the death of their mother. Memory, the weight of history, politics, sport, the unseen - they&apos;re all there. The lighter the touch, the more acutely such themes are delivered. Johanna Kandl&apos;s large, thinly worked tempera paintings have a degree of detail and incident that remains the same however near or far away things are. The horizon is as close and tangible as the foreground, everything between given equal weight and presence. Everything has a particular, almost illustrational clarity, whether she is painting a refugee shanty town in Serbia or the walk towards the Giardini at the 2005 Venice Biennale. We fill in the details. Looking at her work is like being a child again, lost in the pictures in the encyclopaedia. Photography allowed the painting to happen, but has now been left behind. Doig&apos;s 2004 Lapeyrouse Wall, derived in part from a snapshot of a man he often saw walking around Port of Spain in Trinidad (where Doig now lives), is a melange of the seen and the invented, of photographic sources and free painting. The man in the painting is walking away from us, and whatever reasons Doig had to first take the man&apos;s photograph and then to paint him have been left behind as the man walks away. Lapeyrouse Wall doesn&apos;t even feel like an image of modern life, even if the guy with the parasol was first caught on Doig&apos;s digital camera-phone. It seems timeless. \u00b7 The Painting of Modern Life is at the Hayward Gallery, London, from Thursday until December 30.

Ibrahim Gambari, a former Nigerian foreign minister, met General Than Shwe in the junta&apos;s remote new capital, Naypyidaw. He then flew to Rangoon for a second meeting with Ms Suu Kyi, the iconic opposition leader who is held under house arrest. Shortly afterwards Mr Gambari left Burma for Singapore en route to New York, ending a four-day visit. Details of today&apos;s two meetings have yet to emerge. Yesterday, Mr Gambari was stalled for a day and forced to fill in his time visiting a remote corner of Burma courtesy of the military as tensions continued after 12 days of demonstrations that represented the most concerted challenge to the junta&apos;s rule since 1988. The regime&apos;s foreign minister, Nyan Win, told the UN general assembly in New York that &quot;normalcy has now returned&quot; to Burma. Security forces had acted with restraint for a month, but they had had to &quot;take action to restore the situation&quot;, he added. Mr Win made no reference to the deaths, but blamed foreigners for the violence. &quot;Recent events make clear that there are elements within and outside the country who wish to derail the ongoing process [toward democracy] so that they can take advantage of the chaos that would follow,&quot; he said. An uneasy calm has returned to the streets of the main city, Rangoon. Yesterday, troops withdrew cordons from the two pagodas that served as rallying points for the pro-democracy demonstrations, sparked initially by a dramatic rise in fuel prices that hit the already impoverished Burmese people hard. Today the military also eased a night-time curfew, in a sign of their confidence that the protests have been crushed. Instead of taking to the streets, thousands of people last night began marking their disgust at the regime by refusing to watch the nightly news broadcast on state-run television. &quot;This is the least dangerous anti-government activity that I can take,&quot; said a resident. Exile groups remain deeply concerned about the fate of about 400 students and 1,000 arrested monks, whose presence had provided a highly visible lead for the protests in devoutly-Buddhist Burma. Many Burmese are still shocked by the brutal treatment meted out to the monks when monasteries across the country were attacked in night raids by the military. But the fear of the regime that was shrugged off for a few days when more than 100,000 protesters took to Rangoon&apos;s streets has returned. During his four-day visit Mr Gambari, special representative for the UN secretary general, was kept far from the potential flashpoints. After spending an hour Ms Suu Kyi on Sunday, he flew back to Naypyidaw, the capital in the jungle 240 miles north-east of Rangoon. Yesterday he was taken further north by military helicopter to the town of Lashio, in Shan state near the Chinese border, to an obscure government-sponsored workshop. The episode appeared to reflect the weakness of his position and the idiosyncratic nature of Gen Than Shwe, the 74-year-old Burmese leader. The British ambassador, Mark Canning, said that China, Burma&apos;s closest and most influential ally, had pressed for Mr Gambari&apos;s visit to be lengthy and as far-reaching as possible. Burma&apos;s leadership has barred envoys who displeased them in the past, impervious to outside pressure. &quot;Mr Gambari has the full backing of the international community,&quot; said Mr Canning. &quot;Whether that&apos;s sufficient remains to be seen. It&apos;s down entirely to the government rather than the UN. But I think a number of underlying dynamics have changed fundamentally and make us hopeful something might happen.&quot; One political analyst and Burmese exile, Win Min, believes Mr Gambari had the opportunity to conduct shuttle diplomacy, conveying a message from Ms Suu Kyi to the general, and presenting an unvarnished image of the scale of the violence about which the ailing and reclusive general may be in the dark. Some analysts fear that now Mr Gambari&apos;s visit is over Rangoon could suffer a heavy-handed crackdown if protesters again take to the streets. But yesterday there were few reports of demonstrations as traffic flowed and shops reopened. Troops remained on every street corner, although worshippers were again allowed to visit the Shwedagon and Sule pagodas. No crowds gathered. &quot;It seems that a fierce regime has succeeded in terrifying a whole new generation; terrifying them from speaking up,&quot; said Liselot Agerlide, a Swedish diplomat who has just spent five days in Rangoon. One western woman, a long-time Rangoon resident, spoke with a number of monks and found their spirit crushed and terrorised by the raids. Monks told how they had not dared sleep for days, fearing that the military, which had beaten monks in their dormitories, would return to exact further retribution."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/02/rethinkingburma", "sentences": ["But the other end of the paradigm is closing the door to a military who simply slips out of another exit, getting succour from Asian countries outside the financial net, and whose personal fortunes long left the country for Singapore and China."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-02T19:10:00Z", "title": "Rethinking Burma", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "It is time to rethink Burma altogether, to place a moratorium on the old ideas we have been pushing since 1988 and to consider, creatively and expansively, what has worked and what has not. Evidently the west&apos;s strategy is in crisis, as Thant Myint-U argued on Monday. Burma has the most successful lobby in the world. It takes up more webspace in terms of blogs and online libraries, launched by individuals, NGOs and dissidents, than practically any other cause. This is, of course, good considering the irredeemably evil situation inside the country. But good for what - apart from our souls? The regime is still outwardly strong. There is no new generation of leaders, to replace or augment Aung San Suu Kyi or the old guard forced to flee post 1988. Suu Kyi herself is so isolated as to be unable to give direction and her National League for Democracy (NLD) is decapitated and in a state of stagnation, which still gives little breathing room to other progressives inside Burma to debate the future or even strategy. There are only two cohesive forces left in the country, and even these are in some ways mirages. There is the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), a monolithic national political party, created by the junta, whose membership is indoctrinated and largely conscripted - of the &quot;join or we&apos;ll burn your village&quot; variety. It is certain to be the only force to be competitive in elections given its national grass roots structure in Burma. Then there is the military, which is not so much one entity as an ever-shifting web of allegiances whose hierarchy can best be estimated by surveying the array of two-inch-high lead figurines depicting the country&apos;s leading military officials that are on sale in the government gift shops. The only permanent faces on the counter are senior general Than Shwe, chairman of the SPDC and Maung Aye, his deputy and sometime army chief (both are conservative, old and sick). Below them, the generals who head government ministries and the country&apos;s battlefield commands are constantly shuffled to make sure none get too ambitious. Those who play the system too hard, pay with their lives, including General Tin Oo, allied to the former Burmese prime minister Khin Nyunt, who memorably died in a gunfight with rivals in his helicopter in February 2001, four years after his eldest daughter had been killed by a parcel bomb delivered to his Rangoon home. Senior General Than Shwe too plays the game, constantly setting his deputies against each other, in a game of brinkmanship sometimes referred to as A-lei-thar-sar, or &quot;eating the middle&quot;, a reference to a well-known fable about two beavers fighting over a fish, both of them pacified by the fox who gave it to them. But despite this the west still has nothing but low level contacts with USDA leaders or the military, no understanding of either, with just a handful of far sighted long-term Burma heads inside the country (normally from Scandinavian countries) secretly reaching out to the regime and those it supports and acting in the process as covert intermediaries for the NLD and Suu Kyi. Of course there is also a third group in the equation, railed at by George Monbiot, in his attack on Gary Player that replays the old symmetry of the west vs Burma. This group has to be considered too: the entrepreneurs, the masters of the long shot, the opportunists and business people who are taking a risk by placing a bet on Burma. Anyone who has spent any time in Rangoon will agree that very few people have made any effort to get to know the generals other than the drug runners, loggers, gem dealers and Chinese oligarchs - and these entrepreneurs. But their &quot;scene&quot; in Rangoon almost solely consists of a Friday drinks evening at the neocolonial Strand Hotel&apos;s longish bar, where a bazaar cast of free-marketeers gather to console themselves over $8 cocktails, and dream up new ways of waiting for change. No one could claim that this circle is influential. But it has tentative connections to the military that do not exist in Washington or London. Members of this group, who work broadly in computers, engineering, hospitality, security and agriculture, mingle with the children of the generals, many of whom endorse foreign projects, winning stipends off them but also giving subtle insights into what is otherwise a closed world. With their strange lifestyles (I met one who had brought a St Bernard to live with him and so had to build an air-conditioned kennel in order that the shaggy dog could survive a Burmese summer), it is easy to portray them as scabs, or parasites, trading off a cannibalistic regime. But the other end of the paradigm is closing the door to a military who simply slips out of another exit, getting succour from Asian countries outside the financial net, and whose personal fortunes long left the country for Singapore and China. Let&apos;s stop name calling. Let&apos;s stop making calls for things that only make us feel more comfortable in our helplessness. We need to rechannel western energy into understanding the groups with power in order to break the deadlock, getting over the 50 years of antagonism that the military and the NLD are steeped in and that has led the west nowhere at all."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/03/pressandpublishing1", "sentences": ["Sydney is the fourth magazine launched this year after Singapore in March, Delhi in April and Lisbon in September, a company spokesman said."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-03T15:34:48Z", "title": "Time Out goes down under", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Time magazine", "Time Out"], "article": "Time Out magazine has launched in Sydney - the 20th international edition of the iconic entertainment bible.

No details emerged yesterday on the talks between the 74-year-old general and Mr Gambari, a seasoned diplomat and former Nigerian foreign minister. Afterwards, Mr Gambari, who had had to wait three days for the meeting, went on to Singapore before heading for the UN in New York to brief the organisation&apos;s secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. As the talks continued, the regime cut the night-time curfew by two hours. But up to 20,000 troops still patrolled Rangoon&apos;s streets and there was no word of more than 2,000 monks, students and activists who had been seized during the height of the demonstrations when 100,000 people marched in the streets. Exiled dissident groups in neighbouring Thailand were worried about the detainees&apos; conditions, claiming that they were not being given medicine or enough food and water. Opposition groups and foreign diplomats believe many more people have been killed than acknowledged by the junta. Mr Gambari&apos;s brief was to tell the generals that the killings had to stop, that the prisoners should be freed and that the regime should start negotiations on moving towards democracy. It is a measure of the reclusive military leadership and its imperviousness to outside pressure, however, that there was great uncertainty as to whether Mr Gambari would even get to see Than Shwe. The two talked for an hour yesterday in the new administrative capital of Naypidaw, about 200 miles north of Rangoon, and were joined by the junta&apos;s deputy leader, General Maung Aye, and other senior figures. Analysts believe Than Shwe&apos;s views expressed to Mr Gambari would have echoed the hard line given to the UN general assembly in New York hours before by the Burmese foreign minister, Nyan Win, who blamed the street violence on small groups of activists &quot;exploited by opportunists determined to turn the situation into a showdown&quot;, and said the security forces had shown &quot;utmost restraint&quot;.

However, she has found it difficult to alter public perception of her as the daughter of Paul McCartney first, and a designer second. But the heat could finally be off McCartney as a new famous scion made her official debut at Paris fashion week yesterday. Francesca Versace, 25-year-old niece of the late Gianni and of his sister Donatella, showed her first collection just one year after graduating with glowing reviews from London&apos;s Central Saint Martins college. It is inevitable that the speed of her transition will be met with derision from many quarters. Yet she insists she is not simply trading on the family name. Her collection, designed under the auspices of the Singapore label All Dressed Up, is coyly entitled Francesca V. &quot;I am trying to do something different.&quot; By choosing to produce her first collection outside the protection of the Versace empire, Versace intends to signal her own design credentials and avoid the criticisms faced by Jasmine Al Fayed, who while designing under the name Jasmine di Milo staged her shows in her father&apos;s hotel, the Paris Ritz, and sold them in a mini-boutique inside her father&apos;s store, Harrods. The first Francesca V collection, which will be on sale in March, is a modest affair in both senses: it is subdued in palette and tempo and ambition, with simple shapes and little tailoring, and the range would fit in one wardrobe. The Versace name is linked with head-turning glamour and high-voltage sex appeal, but Francesca Versace is, she says, trying to have a different style: &quot;Something women will find easy to wear, and take them from day to night.&quot; This meant neatly tailored summer shorts, pretty camisole tops and T-shirts with inserts fashioned from sheer, ruched silk - inspired, apparently, by turbans - and softly glowing sweater dresses in pale gold threaded with lurex. A short black cocktail dress with a dramatic neckline and bust-emphasising wrap detail was the only piece to adopt the distinctive Versace aesthetic. McCartney&apos;s collection was an assured, savvy blend of urban tailoring - including the one safari-style suit seen on recent catwalks that didn&apos;t look like fancy dress - and soft femininity. McCartney has a tendency to overdo tiers and ruffles, but in those outfits where this is reined in - such as the pansy-printed simple silk voile sundresses - her dresses are wearable and desirable. The highlight of this show, however, was the soft summer tailoring. A cream double-breasted blazer, worn with an ivory georgette camisole and flattering shorts with a faint flower print, was further evidence that the shorts and jacket combination is set to be a mainstream look next summer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/05/guardianobituaries.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["Ryan stepped down from active involvement as chairman in 1998, though he later extended his aviation interests with 16% of Tiger Airways, a Singapore low-cost operator, formed in 2003."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-05T22:43:03Z", "title": "Obituary: Tony Ryan", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "UK news", "Travel"], "article": "Tony Ryan, who has died at 71 after a long illness, will be best remembered for creating the airline that bears his name and giving a whole new meaning to the term no-frills airline. But if Ryanair bears many of his hallmarks - no-nonsense, visionary and hard-driving - the claim by the Irish taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that he placed Ireland centre stage in the global aviation business relates to an earlier venture, when he built the world&apos;s largest aircraft-leasing business, based improbably at Shannon. That met a spectacular crash in the recession of the early 1990s through a lack of liquidity, leaving Ryan eventually to concentrate on the much smaller venture, Ryanair, which had been started in 1985 with a 15-seater aircraft flying from Waterford to Gatwick. It is now Europe&apos;s largest low-cost airline, while Ryan is celebrated as one of the small band of entrepreneurial Irish businessmen who laid the foundations for its ebullient Celtic tiger economy. Born in Thurles, Co Tipperary, Ryan was educated at the local Christian Brothers school. But when he was 18, his father, Martin, an engine driver, died. That ended his hopes of university study. Instead, he joined Aer Lingus as a dispatch clerk, and then management trainee, to support his mother and the younger children. By the early 1970s, he had become leasing manager, responsible for finding profitable uses for aircraft surplus to requirements in the cyclical downturn following the first oil-price shock. In 1974, he set up Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA) to lease aircraft. He put in just \u00a35,000 of his own money, arranging support from Aer Lingus and the merchant bank, Guinness Peat. It turned into a business phenomenon as air travel revived and the leasing model allowed second-tier airlines to grow and others to defray the cost of increasingly expensive aircraft. Starting with a second-hand Boeing 737, by 1991 GPA had a turnover of more than $2bn, pre-tax margins of 14% and consistently exceeded its growth forecasts. Air Canada took a third share and Ryan assembled a line of celebrity directors - former taioseach Garret FitzGerald, ex-British chancellor Nigel Lawson, business troubleshooter John Harvey-Jones, and Irish politician and businessman Peter Sutherland. But it remained Ryan&apos;s business. He held an 8% stake and directed strategy. He enthused a talented group of young Irishmen to scour the world for personal contacts and business intelligence about the airline business, though he would crack the whip to summon them back for a Monday morning meeting at Shannon. As one Irish commentator put it: &quot;In the depressed Ireland of the late 1980s, the company was a beacon of hope. Ordinary Irish managers were able to become the best in the world.&quot; In 1990, GPA announced orders for 700 aircraft over the next decade. But in 1992 came spectacular collapse. An international flotation was planned with great fanfare and media hype, but the banks, spooked by recessionary downturn and the effects of the first Gulf war, failed to come up with the money. Brusque treatment of doubters among investors and the press came home to roost. In the aftermath, the spotlight was turned on the company&apos;s level of debts and in 1993, most of the business was sold to General Electric of the US at a fraction of its earlier multiples. Ryan stepped down, but eventually banked about \u20ac55m from the sale of the rump, renamed AerFi. By contrast, Ryanair, started with two partners, Liam Lonergan and Christy Ryan, had made only steady progress. But again, Ryan showed himself a good judge of people. He promoted the charismatic and uncompromising Michael O&apos;Leary to chief operating officer in 1993 and then chief executive. O&apos;Leary went to work with a will to create a real no-frills airline, shocking even the Ryan family with his decision to do away with food service, and rapidly expanded across Europe with a network of previously under-used airfields. Today it is Europe&apos;s largest low-cost airline and claims to be the world&apos;s largest by passenger numbers. Ryan stepped down from active involvement as chairman in 1998, though he later extended his aviation interests with 16% of Tiger Airways, a Singapore low-cost operator, formed in 2003. He pursued other interests such as horse-breeding and farming in Co Kildare, although technically resident in Monaco. GPA supported the arts in Ireland and Ryan was on the board of the national gallery. He encouraged marine studies and aquaculture in his native west of Ireland, donating the Martin Ryan Marine Science Institute in Galway, as well as funding the Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship at Dublin City University. He was married with three sons. \u00b7 Thomas Anthony (Tony) Ryan, businessman, born February 2 1936; died October 3 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/06/ataleoftwodictatorships", "sentences": ["Starting with Japan, this modernising wave has swept through the four &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore), some Asean countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam), and then to China and India."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-06T13:00:00Z", "title": "A tale of two dictatorships", "tags": ["Pakistan", "World news", "Benazir Bhutto", "Middle East and North Africa", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "Burma and Pakistan are both Asian countries whose military rulers are in trouble. But they are heading in opposite directions, because, whereas Pakistan understands why Asia is rising, Burma does not. Asia is rising because Asian countries are increasingly opening their doors to modernity. Starting with Japan, this modernising wave has swept through the four &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore), some Asean countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam), and then to China and India. Now, it is moving into Pakistan and west Asia. I was in Pakistan during one of its more exciting weeks. Exiled former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, sought to return, but was promptly sent back into exile. The world expected a political eruption. Instead, the country carried on calmly. Pakistan did not erupt because Pakistan&apos;s elite is focused on modernisation. Led by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who was formerly with Citibank, the country has carried out dramatic structural reforms, matching best practices in leading emerging-market economies. This explains high economic growth rates. Pakistan has welcomed foreign trade and investment. And, just as the success of overseas Indians in America inspired Indians in India, Pakistan stands to similarly benefit from its own successful diaspora. But this opening to modernity extends beyond economics and finance. Yes, thousands of madrasas remain open and Islamic fundamentalism is strong. But this has not completely changed the fundamental texture of Pakistan&apos;s society. One sight at LUMS, a leading private university in Lahore, heartened me: how women were dressed. When I visited Malaysian campuses as a young man in the 1960s, few Malay Muslim women wore the hijab. Today, on the same campuses, almost all do. By contrast, at LUMS (which has the look and feel of Harvard Business School), only about 5% of female students wore the hijab, a remarkable expression of social freedom. There has also been an explosion of free media in Pakistan. An astonishing number of Pakistani TV stations openly discuss the activities of Sharif and the other exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. Indeed, many elements of an open society are in place, including - as the world learned in March - an independent judiciary. Burma, by contrast, broadcasts no information on the dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, and would never allow the reinstatement of a chief justice fired by its generals, as Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf did in March, let alone demonstrations in the streets in the chief justice&apos;s favour. Of course, there is much silent resentment about the enormous political and economic space occupied by the Pakistan military, and a danger of a backlash if the military does not learn to share more space with civil society. I met many retired army generals occupying key posts. Fortunately, they seemed to have a temperament closer to Colin Powell&apos;s than to either Than Shwe or Maung Aye, the two closed military minds that have cut off Burma from the world. America&apos;s decision to engage, rather than isolate, Pakistan has also helped. I have no doubt that closer American re-engagement helped to nudge Pakistan in the right direction. Many members of Pakistan&apos;s elite have been educated in American universities - another leading indicator of a country&apos;s orientation. Just imagine how different international relations would be if American leaders could visit Burma (or even Iran) with equal ease and have friendly discussions about agreements and disagreements. Burma&apos;s generals deserve to be condemned for their brutal crackdown on civilian protestors and Buddhist monks. The western world will rush to demand more sanctions and more isolation. But to what avail? Burma has effectively isolated itself for more than 40 years. What can even more isolation achieve? A courageous western leader might confront Burma&apos;s leaders with a threat that would really frighten them: deeper engagement. Burma&apos;s generals genuinely believe that they are protecting Burmese &quot;purity&quot; by shutting out the world. Imagine the impact if as many Burmese generals visited America as Pakistani generals do. A brave young Burmese intellectual, Thant Myint-U (the grandson of former UN secretary general U Thant) asks, &quot;What outside pressure can bring about democratic change? And why, after nearly two decades of boycotts, aid cut-offs, trade bans and diplomatic condemnation, are Burma&apos;s generals apparently more in charge than ever before?&quot; I was in Pakistan as a state guest. But my real mission was to reconnect with my ethnic Sindhi roots, as I had never visited the country where my parents were born. Only those who understand the pain of the partition of British India in 1947 will appreciate the powerful symbolism of a child of Hindu parents being welcomed back warmly to Muslim Pakistan. Those cultural ties helped me understand the Urdu and Sindhi being spoken, and also to feel the deep urge to modernise in the Pakistani soul - an urge that exists alongside the urge to reconnect with Pakistan&apos;s rich cultural past. I left Pakistan feeling hopeful, because I saw the strong desire to join today&apos;s rising Asia. If a similar impulse could be implanted into Burma, both its people and the world would benefit.

Dedicating her life to the search for God, she entered a strict Catholic convent. This was in the pre-Vatican Council days of silent prayer, wimples and long habits. How that vocation fell apart became the subject of the book that first brought Armstrong fame. Through the Narrow Gate is full of rage against the Catholic church, but wind the story on more than 40 years and, as Armstrong herself admits, much of the force of that teenage vocation is still with her. The circumstances have changed dramatically; not for Armstrong the austerity of a convent, but the comforts of a house in one of north London&apos;s prettiest streets, richly decorated in the colours of medieval stained glass - reds, pinks and blues. And, handily, close to plenty of good restaurants - Armstrong&apos;s culinary repertoire doesn&apos;t extend much beyond sandwiches. But the essence of her life is much as she envisaged all those years ago: she has applied herself single-mindedly to the study of humanity&apos;s search for God, and over the last 20 years has been prolific, publishing at regular intervals books that manage that rare combination of clarity and scholarship. Her new book, The Bible: the Biography, is a study of how these scriptures emerged. Such work involves spending long days with obscure texts in her study. Without the distractions of husband or children it makes her, she says, &quot;an urban hermit&quot;. It is also at the heart of why, although she no longer calls herself a Christian, she describes herself as a &quot;person of faith&quot; who has found in her work a vocation and also a liberation from anger and a way to practise compassion: &quot;My study is my religious discipline. There are little moments of transcendence, of awe, which Rabbi Blue tells me is what the study of the Torah is about. St Benedict [of Nursia] also refers to it as the lectio divina in which during study, there are these miniseconds of oratio or prayer.&quot; This consistency in her life is only clear in hindsight. She left the convent at 24, angry and disillusioned, to do a degree at Oxford. Several failed careers followed - academic, teaching, television - as well as persistent ill-health and chronic shyness. She stumbled, reluctantly, into writing and, initially, missed the company of colleagues. Now she admits, &quot;I like silence; I&apos;m a gregarious loner and without the solitude, I lose my gregariousness.&quot; One thing she doesn&apos;t regret is never marrying or having children. &quot;I was never appealing to men,&quot; she announces, adding that &quot;I&apos;m not sure men much like intellectual women and certainly men of my generation wouldn&apos;t want me dashing around.&quot; But perhaps more pertinently, Armstrong continues, &quot;I&apos;d find it intolerable to have someone bumbling about asking me for his socks. I have nothing maternal in me, and men want to be mothered a lot of the time. I wouldn&apos;t want a large, 70-year-old baby wandering about. It&apos;s not always easy and sometimes it&apos;s lonely and desolate, but now I cling to my solitude.&quot; Increasingly, she finds invitations and requests encroaching on that solitude. This is the part of her vocation (she calls it a &quot;ministry&quot;) that she never foresaw: her books - The History of God, A Short History of Islam and The Battle for God - reached the bestseller lists and won for her big audiences in the US and across the Muslim world. Ever since 9/11 she has been in demand all over the world as a speaker and writer to explain Islam and religious fundamentalism and why religion is being increasingly invoked as a justification for violence. This year has included visits to Malaysia, Turkey, Jordan, Singapore and Egypt, where she received from President Mubarak an award for services to Islam made by Al-Azhar, arguably the most prestigious university in the Muslim world. A stint at Harvard beckons this autumn with a visit to Pakistan already planned for early next year. &quot;I&apos;m invited by governments, and Muslims in these countries thank me for speaking to westerners in a way they can understand about Islam. When I was in Lahore recently, it was very touching; my books are very popular in Pakistan. Chambermaids and porters in the hotel were rushing up to me saying, &apos;Thank you, thank you, you&apos;re helping us.&apos;&quot; &quot;A recent Gallup poll in Muslim countries showed that the one thing they wanted more than anything from the west - even more than an end to aggressive foreign policies - was respect for their faith.&quot; Back in the early 1980s when she was researching the Crusades, it was the prejudice of friends and colleagues towards Islam which first alerted Armstrong to an old history: &quot;The Crusades was the beginning of Europe finding its soul. Islam and Judaism became the shadow side, the foil against which we [Christian Europe] measured ourselves. A righteous contempt of Islam was entwined with our anti-semitism. Ever since, our rhetoric about Muslims reflects a blind anxiety about our own behaviour - anxieties about our own capacity for violence are projected onto Muslims, similarly our attitudes towards women.&quot; Finding these long historical roots to current attitudes towards Islam has given Armstrong a passionate sense of her own personal crusade: &quot;Even before 9/11 I was gripped by a sense of dread: our lack of criticism about what we were doing in the Middle East - the slagging off of a whole religious tradition. It is part of a habit of prejudice that made the death camps possible. It&apos;s as if we hadn&apos;t learnt anything from the 1930s.&quot; Armstrong has a sense of urgency - &quot;we should all be worried sick&quot;; &quot;there is so little time&quot; - because, she argues, the history of religious fundamentalism over the past century shows, time and again, that when under attack such movements become more extreme. It was true of Christian fundamentalism in the 20th century as it withdrew from the mainstream into a hostile right-wing movement; it was true of the Muslim Brotherhood under persecution in Egypt in the 1960s. The danger now, Armstrong explains, is of more - and worse - incidents of terrorism involving perhaps nuclear devices; and yet western policies are only making such events more likely. &quot;Sometimes you feel you are being heard, other times not. It&apos;s like snakes and ladders. Along comes an issue like the Danish [anti-Islam] cartoons and you slither back to the beginning. There are some people - including liberal Guardian readers - who have a glimmer in the eye, an eagerness to believe the worst about Islam.&quot; As Armstrong expands her thinking a pattern emerges of how human traditions end up betraying their greatest strengths. She worries that Islam is in danger of giving up its &quot;unique genius&quot;, which is its pluralism; the &quot;Qur&apos;an is quite clear that all prophets are equally valid, and God tells Muhammad that &apos;we [God] have created diversity, not one ummah [community of Muslims]&apos;&quot;. Similarly the &quot;western secular tradition is in danger of betraying its own principle of tolerance&quot;. The latter is part of the reason why she agreed to do the history of the Bible: &quot;People are interpreting scripture in all kinds of stupid ways, including Richard Dawkins.&quot; In the book, Armstrong takes up and develops themes that have long interested her, such as the role of myth in articulating religious and spiritual truth as opposed to factual truth. She cites Plato&apos;s two ways of arriving at truth - mythos and logos - and how both had their own sphere of competence; confuse the two and you end up with bad science and bad religion. She argues that there has been plenty of evidence of both in the last century. Religious leaders have been &quot;infected by rationalisation&quot; and speak as if myth was factually, scientifically and historically true. Belief as a form of intellectual assent is a &quot;very modern, 18th-century invention&quot;, and derives from the old German word &quot;to love&quot;. In earlier times, she adds, the emphasis was not on belief as doctrine - the arguments about what people should or should not believe - but on the practice of belief, how you actually behaved. She stresses how religious fundamentalism breaks with its own traditions; for example, the way such Christians read the Bible literally is in profound contrast to thousands of years in which the religious scriptures were read, not as a literal text to be argued over, but as a spiritual activity - part of a process of prayer and divine inspiration to help understand their contradictions and conflicting messages. Armstrong&apos;s next book - on divine incarnation in world religions - has been postponed to enable her to participate in the fevered contemporary debate about the value of religion, which has been dominated by prominent thinkers who have lambasted faith as a gross distortion of the human spirit. &quot;Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens have set up a caricature of religion. This kind of aggressive secular fundamentalism feeds disdain which - as the Buddha might say - is not skilful. The test of any set of ideas must be whether they increase charity; do they help to create better understanding? - we don&apos;t need any more polarity. But it&apos;s a phenomenon which is very popular. &quot;What I want to look at is why religion has become incredible, and if there is anything we can do to salvage or re-interpret it. What is faith about? And do we still need it?&quot; Big questions, but then Armstrong has made such things her forte. It is her capacity to synthesise, draw connections and patterns in religious experience that has brought some order and insight into this complex subject. &quot;All religions,&quot; she concludes, &quot;are designed to teach us how to live, joyfully, serenely, and kindly, in the midst of suffering.&quot; This judgment implies that her book will argue that we still need religion. With impressive confidence, she says she plans to have it finished in a year.

It&apos;s big money, but more than that, it&apos;s almost certainly the end of one era, and the beginning of another quite different one, although exactly what that might be, nobody&apos;s as yet quite sure. Just a few days before the Wheelers&apos; announcement, Mark Ellingham, the founder of Rough Guides, decided to step down from the company that he&apos;d created 25 years ago and subsequently sold to Penguin.

Do yourself and everyone else a favour and stay cool.&apos;) It&apos;s a legacy of Baedeker&apos;s improving Victorian stance, this tendency of guidebook writers to order you about. Oh, they can be such pompous know-it-alls! &apos;Before you even think about heading out into the hills alone, take advice ... ignore the counsel of well-meaning Beirutis and ask in the villages.&apos; Who wrote that? Oh, yes, that&apos;s right, it was me (Travellers&apos; Survival Kit Lebanon 1996, co-authored with my friend, Anna Sutton).&apos; It&apos;s so easy to be pompous. And so enjoyable. Particularly in a travelling context. In a nutshell: the past was better, you should have got there sooner, and you paid how much for it, you fool? If there&apos;s any area of modern life that has benefited from new technology and yet in which we resist the notion that it might possibly just be progress, it&apos;s travel. It&apos;s the prelapsarian ideal we want. No gift shops or touts. Just unsullied nature, and, now you mention it, a charming small hotel with crisp cotton sheets and maybe a nice glass of something chilled. It&apos;s an inconvenient fact that the good old days weren&apos;t always. My experience of backpacking in former Soviet hellholes would have been immeasurably transformed with the invention of Couchsurfing, and in the age of Google, Anna and I wouldn&apos;t have got away with our more creative touches. At work on a guidebook to Russia &amp; the Republics and at a loss as to how enliven a section on Minsk nightlife, we endowed our friend Isabel Henton with a set of pink performing poodles and made her the star of the Belarusian State Circus. There&apos;s not many jolly japes these days. But then there&apos;s also no detracting from Lonely Planet&apos;s extraordinary success: it publishes more than 500 titles, has sold 80 million guidebooks, translated into eight or more languages. On the wall of their London office is a framed certificate noting that they have been judged to be a &apos;Superbrand&apos; and so the story goes, when Bill Clinton went to visit Australia, he requested an audience with the Prime Minister, and &apos;someone from Lonely Planet&apos;. I haven&apos;t met Maureen but Tony is as mild-mannered and unassuming a multi-millionaire as you could hope to find. Everyone admires them and applauds their achievement. And yet I talk to Hilary Bradt and Mark Ellingham and Charles James, and Bryn Thomas from another small independent, Trailblazer, and James Daunt, of Daunt Books, a specialist travel bookshop, and nobody can resist putting the boot into Lonely Planet just a touch: it&apos;s travel publishing&apos;s Microsoft. When I ring Charles James, he tells me that, funnily enough, he&apos;s currently reading a book by Pete McCarthy, &apos;and every few pages, he goes and slags off Lonely Planet and all the sad Lonely Planeters hanging around the hostels, and of course, that delights me no end&apos;. &apos;I mean have you seen their first book? And ours too ... If you compare what they&apos;re doing now with the first books, there&apos;s no comparison. They&apos;re tremendously good these days whereas back then we had, what? 220 pages and a few scrappy hand-drawn maps? We sold them for \u00a35 which, bearing in mind, this was 30 years ago, was good money, and they just sold terrifically well because there was nothing else out there. For a while, it was absolutely brilliant.&apos; It was absolutely brilliant, I agree. He gave us a commissioning letter, a very small amount of cash, and off we went to Lebanon with carte blanche. On the telephone, Bryn Thomas tells me of his hell updating Lonely Planet India (&apos;up at dawn, five hotels before breakfast ...&apos;) and how curtailed the format was (&apos;it just wasn&apos;t much fun writing for them in the end, it was so controlled&apos;) whereas Anna and I swanned around with a Blue Guide from 1969, spending weeks tracking down lost temples on the sides of the Bekaa Valley, establishing exactly which was our favourite Beiruti felafel seller, turning up for coffee with Walid Jumblatt, the former warlord, and composing disquisitions on, among other things, the appearance of female newscasters on Hezbollah TV. It barely sold a copy, of course, what with some slightly bad timing with some rockets and the Israeli army. But still, as I always told Charles, minor quibbles, minor quibbles. Hilary Bradt, whose company concentrates on the more obscure destinations, published her first book in 1974, a year after the Wheelers did, although she wasn&apos;t even aware of the existence of their books at the time. There&apos;s no ignoring them now though. &apos;Everyone asks why we don&apos;t do a book on Thailand,&apos; she says. &apos;In order to have something concrete to say, I counted up the number of Thailand guides in Stanfords the other day, and do you know how many there were? Forty-two. And the world doesn&apos;t need 43 guides to Thailand, that&apos;s for sure.&apos; They&apos;re still finding destinations, she says, &apos;but if Lonely Planet comes along and does it, well, it doesn&apos;t matter that we have the better book, people just look at the brand. I think they&apos;ve done terrifically well, it&apos;s just hard as a small publisher not to resent it.&apos; Everybody has a tale to tell about Lonely Planet&apos;s quasi-mythical power. There&apos;s the apocryphal story, for example, about the Rainbow Lodge. Recommended by Lonely Planet, it boomed. The other guesthouse owners grew jealous. So one hotelier changed his name to Rainbow Lodge. Then another. Until there was a whole street of Rainbow Lodges and busloads of confused backpackers not knowing which way to turn. &apos;That&apos;s not apocryphal,&apos; Tony Wheeler says, when I ask him. &apos;That happens all the time. All over the place. They&apos;re always at it. There was one place in Hanoi where we recommended the Globetrekker agency, and then a Globaltrekker agency appeared, and a Globe Treks agency, and Globetrekker 2.&apos; He&apos;s not an it-was-so-much-better-back-then sort, Tony. Part of this, of course, is that Lonely Planet must be seen to be striding boldly into an age of digital guides but more it seems that he still loves travelling, is a self-described &apos;obsessive&apos; about it, and still gets a kick out of going somewhere new (he&apos;s on 130 countries now &apos;although Maureen tells me it&apos;s absurd to count&apos;). Hilary Bradt, on the other hand, says she misses the &apos;serendipity&apos; of the old days and, now in her 60s, she thinks &apos;us older ones&apos; are more adventurous than young people who all use the same guidebook and go to same places &apos;they follow the pack because they don&apos;t feel secure enough although of course when I was 20 I was exactly the same&apos;. Of course, it&apos;s not just that guidebooks have changed in the last three and a half decades, it&apos;s that everything has: cheap flights, mobile phones, emails, the internet, nice boutique hotels with quaint original features but tip-top Western plumbing. James Daunt tells me that the latest hot potato to fly off the shelves are the &apos;Luxe&apos; guides. &apos;What?&apos; I say. &apos;Those crappy little things on a concertina-ed bit of paper?&apos; But yes, apparently we&apos;ve come over a bit Russian and want our luxury above all else. I idly think of setting up Super Sexxxxxy VIP Guides and really cleaning up. The only real link between now and the ideology of Across Asia on the Cheap is in the Sixties&apos; notions of freedom and self-fulfilment that are still the vital ingredient of all travel narratives - both literary and personal - and that these guides were the first to harness, repackage and sell right back to us. And if a book remains a book or becomes a pdf, that&apos;s unlikely to change. It&apos;s time, though, perhaps, for the counterculture to move on. Lonely Planet-meets-the-BBC is now the establishment. It&apos;s a nationalised industry. It&apos;s practically the Queen! Where are the Sex Pistols when you need them? What everyone complains about up to and including Tony Wheeler, is how bland, formulaic, PC, corporate, the books have become. The very first Lonely Planet guide I used was the one to India. &apos;It&apos;s still the one I&apos;m proudest of,&apos; Tony says, a best-seller when it came out in 1980 and it was still the only one to the country by the time that I picked it up in 1989, and slavishly read its every word. What I remember most about it, though, is &apos;Geoff&apos;, or Geoff Crowther, one of the original authors not just of the India guide but the Africa and South American one too, whose author bio showed to have a full beard and a vegetable garden in Australia devoted to exotic herbs. Whole evenings passed doing Geoff impressions (it was a variation, basically, of Neil, the hippy off the Young Ones): on where to score dope, or get the best view of a certain temple. His opinions were forever butting into the text. So annoying! Yet, somehow, so memorable. He&apos;s gone now. A broken man living in Goa, Tony Wheeler tells me, and it&apos;s hard not to feel a pang. Is it a parable, I wonder? Although in the end, I decide it&apos;s probably not. The latest edition of Lonely Planet India is a monumental 1,236 pages, produced by 12 writers, and it&apos;s, without a doubt, a terrifically useful book if you need to navigate your way from Calcutta to Bangalore; probably even more so when it&apos;s a couple of megabytes rather than several kilos of dense matter weighing like a stone at the bottom of your bag. But, well, there&apos;s a certain something that&apos;s been lost; a Geoffness, I think I&apos;ll call it, that joins the scrapheap of travellers&apos; hand-me-downs waiting to be collected at a dusty poste restante, in a land far, far away. From hippies to hip hotels The original Seventies backpacker guides used to revel in their countercultural status, sneering at smart hotels and posh restaurants wherever possible. Now, however, &apos;style guides&apos; are the fastest growing sector of the market.  &apos;Young couples with money buy these cool guides because they are the ones to be seen with,&apos; says Brett Wolstencroft manager of Daunt Books, a specialist travel bookshop in Marylebone.  These are the front-runners:  Hip Hotels: Started the trend of style-focused travel guides; now has more than 15 titles.  Luxe Guides: Pocket-sized and written with acerbic wit.  Hedonist&apos;s Guides: Sleek but comprehensive, photo-heavy, quirky destinations.  Nota Bene: A subscription service, costing \u00a3235 per year.  Wallpaper City Guides: Smart, snobby and full of travel porn. Then and now: the changing face of travel Top backpackers&apos; destinations 1972 Hippie trail to India, Afghanistan and southern Asia. The choice is influenced by psychedelic music and drugs.  2007 Australia is the most popular, thanks to the influence of Aussie soaps. Thailand and Vietnam come next; adventure-seekers head to Latin America and South Korea. Off limits to travellers 1972 Vietnam, Cambodia, China, USSR. 2007 Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq.  Who goes backpacking? 1972 Only adventurous hippies, and people think they are mad.  2007 Everyone! According to Gapyear.com, 230,00 18-24-year-olds, 90,000 25-35-year-olds and 200,000 55-65-year-olds travel from Britain on a gap year annually. The UK gap-year market is valued at \u00a32.2bn a year; globally it&apos;s \u00a35bn.  Cost of flights 1972 Return to New York from London costs \u00a375 (equivalent of \u00a3866 today); a round-the-world ticket costs \u00a3600 (\u00a35,500 today). 2007 Return to New York costs from \u00a3200; a round-the-world ticket costs \u00a3600. On the screen 1972 Travel shows don&apos;t exist. Michael Palin is known for Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus. 2007 Tribe, Michael Palin&apos;s New Europe, Coast ... travel shows are huge.  Best-sellers 1972 The Joy of Sex is published. Novelist Paul Theroux hasn&apos;t yet turned his hand to travel writing. 2007 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the smash of the year. Travellers read Khaled Hosseini&apos;s A Thousand Splendid Suns and spin-off books linked to TV series. Annual leave 1972 Most of the working population have 15 days off a year, but almost 10 million have 10 days&apos; leave or less. 2007 The government announces an increase in statutory leave to 24 days last week, rising to 28 days in April 2009. Low-cost flights 1972 British Airways have a near monopoly on flights from the UK. Laker Airways pioneers a &apos;no-frills&apos; airline model, asking passengers to bring their own food, but it folds in 1982.  2007 There are dozens of no-frills airlines, including Easyjet, Ryanair, Virgin Blue in Australia and Southwest Airlines in the US. Airport security 1972 US airlines begin mandatory inspection of baggage and passengers. 2007 US fingerprints and scans irises of passengers.

Three shots ahead after the third round, Dougherty overcame a nightmare start - two holes, two bogeys - to forge a two-shot victory over a distinguished leaderboard and claim the \u00a3392,000 winner&apos;s cheque, easily the biggest pay-day of his life. &quot;This is the one I have been waiting for a long time, a really big one,&quot; the Englishman said after the second win of the professional career, to add to the 2005 Singapore Open. &quot;Hopefully, I&apos;ll be able to push on from here.&quot; He bounced back from losing his overnight lead in the space of five holes to sign for a closing 71 and four-round total of 270, 18 under par, and will have taken enormous encouragement from the names beneath him on the final leaderboard, a list headed by Justin Rose, who shot a three-under par 69 to finish two back, and featuring Ernie Els, who looked a prospective winner until he putted into a greenside bunker on the 16th hole en route to a shocking triple-bogey seven. Dougherty is a product of the Faldo Series, a scheme for nurturing elite young golfers founded by the six-time major champion. Nothing would give the younger man more satisfaction than making his mentor&apos;s Ryder Cup team to play the United States in Kentucky next September. Yesterday&apos;s victory, coupled with a palpable mood around European golf these days that the guard is changing, makes the Englishman a realistic contender for team golf&apos;s biggest event. Marginally less realistic, but possibly even more enticing, are the Ryder Cup prospects of McIlroy, who looked every inch a superstar in waiting as he returned a four-under-par 68. As it turned out, the teenager might have won the tournament but for a poor drive on the 14th that landed out-of-bounds and cost him a double-bogey seven. Lesser talents, more experienced players, might have crumbled, but McIlroy birdied three of his last four holes to finish on 15 under par. That was good enough for third place and a cheque of \u00a3147,000.

Any person or business that&apos;s based or in some way associated with Asia can apply for a domain which will end in &quot;.asia&quot;. It covers anyone who does business in any of 73 countries, spanning Turkey through to mainland Australia. It covers four billion people, or two-thirds of the world&apos;s population. Curb your enthusiasm at the back. Oh, you were standing up to leave? Can&apos;t blame you. In what must have domain registrars around the world rubbing their hands with glee and ordering new yachts, we now have another TLD that nobody can quite remember asking for (is it like the gherkin in a fastburger?) which will coin it from all the companies that feel they have to register their name just to make sure that nobody else does. Which especially means all the banks and other brands, but which equally means that typosquatters and phishers can have a new way to play havoc with everyone&apos;s lives. To quote from the press release..  No one knows which names will be most popular on October 9, when the .asia registry starts accepting the first round of applications, but EURid&apos;s experience offers some clues. In the first two days .eu domain names became available, EURid received 227 applications for sex.eu, 118 for hotel.eu and 94 for travel.eu.     &quot;The .asia registry will probably see the same rush for generic names but that will pass,&quot; said Marc Van Wesemael, general manager of EURid. &quot;After a time, Europeans realised that a .eu domain was good for business. People in Asia will surely discover that as well.&quot;    Let&apos;s not enquire quite whose business. Onward!  Within a few months of its launch, .eu became the third-largest European top-level domain. Today close to 2.6 million domain names are registered and the number of active .eu sites is growing. Bridgestone, Century 21 and Daikin are among the many companies that use .eu domain names to promote their business and products.    Our regular columnist Seth Finkelstein has pointed out again and again the pointlessness of introducing a .xxx TLD; we think that .asia is just the same thing without the sex. Well, without quite so much of the sex. And at \u00a330 per domain registered, that&apos;s a pretty neat income stream if .asia gets as much business as .eu. And likely it&apos;ll be  moist  most of the same names all over again - and perhaps in multiple language forms too. Surely the really useful direction is for more granular detail, not less: we want to have postcode and zipcode-level subdomains of the main countries; that would really help us find something (so you&apos;d have alicesrestaurant.stockbridge.massachusetts.us). Telling us something is in Asia is hardly useful, is it?

Indra Setiawan is accused, along with a senior Garuda staff member, Rohainil Aini, of aiding the main suspect in the murder of Munir Thalib, who died after being poisoned with arsenic on an international flight. Mr Thalib, 38, a human rights lawyer who was an outspoken critic of the military&apos;s tactics in quelling dissent in East Timor, Aceh and Papua, died on board a Garuda flight bound for Amsterdam in 2004. A Garuda pilot, Polycarpus Priyanto, was convicted of the murder in 2005 and jailed for 14 years, but the sentence was quashed by the supreme court last year because of a lack of witnesses and evidence. Prosecutors, who are also fighting to overturn the supreme court decision, accuse Mr Setiawan of helping to assign Mr Priyanto, who was off duty at the time, to the Jakarta-Amsterdam service on which the lawyer died. During the original case Mr Setiawan told how he received a letter from Indonesia&apos;s intelligence agency asking him to name Mr Priyanto as flight security officer, an authorisation that Mr Aini signed. But Mr Setiawan later said he lost the letter, which was signed by the intelligence agency&apos;s deputy head. A state prosecutor, Noor Rachmad, accused Mr Setiawan of being an accessory to the &quot;intentional and premeditated murder&quot; after fresh evidence emerged that Mr Priyanto poisoned the activist while he was in transit at Singapore&apos;s Changi airport. Mr Thalib died a few hours before reaching Amsterdam. A postmortem by the Dutch authorities found he had ingested a large amount of arsenic. But Hari Wicaksono, a defence lawyer for Mr Setiawan - who faces up to 20 years&apos; jail if convicted - questioned the prosecution&apos;s reliance on the assumption that Mr Priyanto was the murderer. &quot;The prosecution charges are unclear and should be dismissed,&quot; he said. &quot;The supreme court ruling makes them irrelevant.&quot; Mr Thalib&apos;s wife has toured the world meeting human rights activists and politicians, and won a promise from the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, that his killers would be punished."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/11/burma.travel", "sentences": ["A businessman who flew in from Singapore last week on an Air Bagan Airbus capable of carrying more than 200 passengers said there were only two dozen people on board."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-11T09:03:48Z", "title": "Burmese hotels hit as crackdown prompts drop in tourism", "tags": ["World news", "Travel", "Hotels", "Laura Bush", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "Last month&apos;s pro-democracy protests in Burma and the junta&apos;s ruthless and bloody crackdown have hit tourism hard, with some hotels slashing prices by 80% to try to attract visitors, industry insiders said. &quot;There has been a steep drop in foreign arrivals - both businessmen and tourists - since the protests reached a climax in the last week of September,&quot; a manager at a Rangoon-based travel agency said yesterday. Most hotels had more than halved their rates, the manager said, but occupancy levels were below break-even point, a reflection of the outrage at last month&apos;s crackdown on monks and civilians in which at least 10 people were killed. According to the Myanmar Times, a semi-official business weekly, the Savoy Hotel has axed its prices to just $20 (\u00a39.80) a night, compared with a normal high season rate of $110. &quot;Business has been very bad. Most of us have been out of a job for weeks,&quot; said one English-speaking tour guide. &quot;It is not just because of the seasonal factor. We had a lot of cancellations. &quot; Even before the unrest tourism was in a parlous state, partly due to activists&apos; calls for a boycott in order to keep tourist dollars out of the generals&apos; pockets. Burma says it had 192,000 tourists in the year to March. By contrast, neighbouring Thailand expects about 13 million visitors this year, and even war-scarred Cambodia is aiming for 2 million.

A businessman who flew in from Singapore last week on an Air Bagan Airbus capable of carrying more than 200 passengers said there were only two dozen people on board.

And next month that destiny will finally be realised, when the Queen launches the terminus into the world of 21st-century high-speed European rail travel. From November 14, Eurostar trains will writhe out from under the station&apos;s unforgettable train shed roof through new tunnels and \u00a35.8bn-worth of newly forged engineering works to reach Paris Gare du Nord in just two-and-a-quarter hours. Europe was embedded in the station&apos;s architectural DNA from the very beginning. Just look at the washed-and-brushed facade of the Midland Grand Hotel fronting the magnificently restored and remodelled terminus. Scott&apos;s ambitious design for the hotel and station clearly plundered the architectural treasuries of medieval Europe. From the dust and soot of the Euston Road rose a Railway Age cathedral, cloth hall and castle, all hammered and crafted into a convincing and enthralling whole, borrowing spires, arches, corbels and crockets from Amiens, Brussels, Ypres and all cardinal gothic points south through the Alps to Verona and Venice. Scott&apos;s rich palette of building materials, meanwhile, was drawn as much from the salmon-pink bricks specially baked for the job by Mr Gripper of Nottingham as it was from the hues of churches that this intensely hard-working architect had once admired in northern Italy. St Pancras himself, of whom precious little is known, is buried in Rome, a long way from the charred and soiled remains of the 19th-century slums of Agar Town that were demolished to make way for the Midland Railway&apos;s steamy entrance into London. As for the connections with Paris, the Scott family was only too aware of these. George Gilbert Scott Jr, Sir Gilbert&apos;s son and another brilliant architect, ended his days, after a drunken and licentious reverie in Paris, divorced and quite mad in one of the bedrooms of the Midland Grand - in the architectural clutches, as it were, of his famous father. Along the corridor leading from Scott Jr&apos;s room, great Gothic vaults designed by Sir Gilbert had only recently been adorned with paintings of Temperance and Chastity, virtues associated at the time with neither Paris nor Sir Gilbert&apos;s wayward son. Behind Scott&apos;s gothic phantasmagoria - a building &quot;too good for its purpose&quot;, said the architect - passengers found themselves beneath the roof of what remains one of the wonders of the railway world. This soaring, single-span iron-and-glass train shed was engineered by William Henry Barlow (1812-1902) and Rowland Mason Ordish (1824-1886), both of whom had worked with Joseph Paxton on the design of the Crystal Palace, home in 1851 to the first of the great world &quot;expos&quot;. Their achievement was only overshadowed when Gustave Eiffel completed his famous tower in time for the 1889 Paris Expo. Barlow&apos;s international career had begun in distant Istanbul, while, after St Pancras, Ordish went on to work in Bombay, St Petersburg and Singapore, shaping the roof of Amsterdam&apos;s Central station along the way. St Pancras, then, was an international station of sorts long before the completion of the new 68-mile high-speed link that will see Eurostar trains racing under the Thames flood plains and through Kent to Ashford and so on via the Channel tunnel, when they will join Europe&apos;s ever-growing network of 300kph (185mph) electric railways. It is hard to believe that all this might not have existed, as you walk into St Pancras today through brand new gothic doors and enter the station&apos;s previously unseen undercroft, the former storage basement with its 800 Victorian iron pillars, where the Eurostar ticket-machines, check-in points and security controls are today, before riding long, silent escalators up to the trains basking beneath Barlow and Ordish&apos;s glorious roof. This, the most adventurous and biggest roof of its kind for decades after it was built, now painted a fetching sky blue and flooded with daylight? This station, with its quarter-mile, 300kph trains, a huge cocktail bar, a branch of Foyles stocked with 20,000 titles, a smart Searcy&apos;s restaurant and brasserie, independent coffee bars, floors covered in timber and stone rather than sticky British airport-style carpet, new gothic carvings, newly cast gothic door handles, and a nine-metre-high sculpture of lovers meeting under the station clock? How could anyone ever have thought of denying us this engineering aria, this architectural hymn? And yet, 40-plus years ago, when the idea of a Channel tunnel railway was little more than a half-forgotten Victorian fantasy, St Pancras station was very nearly a martyr to the fundamentalist creeds of &quot;rationalisation&quot; (for which read cost-cutting), &quot;change&quot; (for change&apos;s sake) and &quot;modernisation&quot;. While, today, none of us would take seriously politicians who bandy such weasel words about, these were quite the thing in the 60s. Especially when it came to railways. When St Pancras was threatened with destruction in 1966, eminent architectural historians - including Nikolaus Pevsner and tireless conservationists, notably John Betjeman - fought a vigorous campaign to shame British Railways and Harold Wilson&apos;s government. Only a few years earlier, London had lost the world-famous Euston Arch. This time, the conservation lobby had developed the teeth of a great white shark and the grip of a bulldog. St Pancras was listed Grade 1, the same status as those other great gothic national monuments, Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster. Even then, such eminent historians as Sir John Summerson, curator of Sir John Soane&apos;s Museum, refused to support the cause. St Pancras was seen as vulgar, even by such critical eyes as Summerson&apos;s; here was a Victorian parvenu, a mongrel of a design in which Scott&apos;s faux-medieval spires failed to meet Barlow and Ordish&apos;s Victorian &quot;hi-tech&quot; train shed with any degree of architectural conviction. This seems odd to me, as it might to you. The Victorian engineers&apos; roof at St Pancras forms a pointed arch and has always seemed the very model of a modern gothic vault, all iron and glass rather than medieval stone and marble. Hotel and station seem comfortably married. What Summerson, contemporary British Railways executives and so many politicians in the mid-60s disliked about St Pancras seems to have been that it reminded them of their essentially Victorian upbringing, all starch and nannies, ice-cold bedrooms, chivalrous tales by Walter Scott and morning doses of cod liver oil. This generation wanted to be staunchly modern. Today, a fully restored, boldly extended and slightly reworked St Pancras proves that we can have our boiled beef and our oil-drizzled fettuccine and eat it. Here, if anywhere, the worlds of High Victoriana and that of &quot;brands&quot;, digitalia and non-stop shopping come together in a most delightful way. As anyone would who has loved St Pancras station since earliest childhood, I came here again a few days ago with a degree of trepidation. This is where I had been taken to even before I went to school to see such trains as The Robin Hood, the Thames-Clyde Express, The Palatine and the improbably glamorous Midland Pullman pulling out past Victorian gas-holders and old goods yards. I had also been taken on a tour of St Pancras Chambers, as the hotel was known after 1935, when the guests were kicked out and replaced by British Rail executives. Scott&apos;s demeaned masterpiece was potted about with obscure railway offices lit by naked fluorescent tubes and separated by hastily knocked-up partition walls. I was happily haunted for many years afterwards by the spooky gothic stairs, halls, corridors and windows I had witnessed vanishing into a kind of architectural gloaming even in the middle of a bright June day. Years later, when I came to read Gormenghast, my mind&apos;s eye model of Mervyn Peake&apos;s frightening fictional castle was St Pancras. I&apos;m not sure, but I think it might have been his, too. I have to say that the business and design team put in charge of reshaping St Pancras for the high-speed railway renaissance, completing its task when so many of us are fed up with being treated like criminals and cattle in British airports, has performed little short of a miracle here. Although the whole caboodle - station, five-star hotel, costly flats inside the former Midland Grand - will not be complete for a few years yet, this fact will have little effect on passengers using Eurostar services. Passengers using regional rail services, however, might well complain that because the great train shed at St Pancras is given over, lock, stock and corbel, to Eurostar services, they have been demoted to platforms under a new, flat concrete, steel and glass roof, described as a &quot;magic carpet&quot; by its architects, set at the very far end of the station and seemingly closer to Manchester than Euston Road. But, then, this \u00a3800m, decade-long project has always been an almighty juggling act, and it would take the most curmudgeonly strap-hanger on the 08:16 from St Albans to St Pancras to deny the brilliance of what has been achieved. Alastair Lansley, a director of Arup, one of the four engineering companies that form Rail Link Engineering, the consortium charged with building the high-speed railway, has been the architect in charge of St Pancras for the past 11 years. One of the last of British Railway&apos;s in-house architects, Lansley, together with his former colleague Nick Derbyshire, was responsible for the 1990s redesign of Liverpool Street, another fine Victorian gothic terminus saved from demolition with more than a little help from Betjeman. Lansley excels in matching traditional buildings with contemporary design. Recently, he built a house for himself and his wife in Twickenham, Middlesex. From the outside you would never guess that this was anything other than a singularly handsome and immaculately restored Regency villa. It happens to be brand new. Indoors, the house is impeccably modern, with bathroom fittings designed by none less than Norman Foster, the architect who initiated the design for the extension of the train shed at St Pancras that was then handed over to Lansley to execute. &quot;It&apos;s all been a bit of an architectural and engineering roller coaster ride,&quot; says Lansley. &quot;Some of the engineers have been involved with the high-speed link for 18 and 19 years. This is one of those all-embracing projects demanding considerable planning and concentrated skill. It really has been finished, as they say, on time and on budget, and to a very high quality indeed. I think this is something to celebrate, and we&apos;ll certainly have lots of champagne on ice when the Queen comes here on November 6. &quot;The great thing is that all the different parties involved came to work with each other remark- ably smoothly. When we wanted to get rid of the original platforms and install a new concrete platform for Eurostar trains under the Barlow-Ordish roof, English Heritage couldn&apos;t have been more gracious or helpful. They&apos;ve drawn us up short here and there, and for the good of the project, but when I look back and think of what we&apos;ve dared to do here, I think the conservationists have been very generous.&quot; It was Lansley who had the audacious idea of opening up the station&apos;s undercroft - once used to store barrels of beer that were brought down in their hundreds of thousands by goods trains from Burton-on-Trent - to create a visual connection and passenger link between this vast basement and the newly restored iron-and-glass arched roof so very high above it. This move has been the making of the new station. Now, Eurostar passengers walk into the former beer cellar to check in to their Paris and Brussels-bound trains. This thrilling space supports the station and trains above it on a forest of iron columns. Daylight stream down from the great incisions Lansley&apos;s team have made in the platform floor. Quality abounds in this extraordinary public space. Rich, scratch-proof timber floors here. Stone flagstones there. No carpets. No McDonald&apos;s. The very latest in easy-to-use information technology. All this in Britain, the land of tat, executive homes, chainstore mania and shopping malls. &quot;I remember meetings,&quot; says Lansley, &quot;in which we said that the retailing element of the design ought to be based more along the lines of [Piccadilly&apos;s upmarket] Burlington Arcade than those of Oxford Street. So, we&apos;ve got the upper end of the chains here, mixed in with independent shops and bars, and all of these tamed by the architectural framework, which takes visual precedence over purely commercial considerations. We&apos;ve built new lime-mortared gothic brickwork from a purpose-made kiln in Nottingham; we&apos;ve cast new gothic door handles and we&apos;ve made new gothic doors for the shop fronts. So, although there&apos;s lots of brand-new engineering details, railway equipment, information displays and so on, the station looks all of a piece.&quot; This is all the more remarkable given the extremely complex nature of the project. Eurostar platforms and undercroft aside, works include a new concrete station beneath St Pancras for the Bedford to Brighton services, connecting the terminus with Luton and Gatwick airports; a modernised and vastly extended London Underground station at King&apos;s Cross St Pancras; new regional train platforms for the Midland main line and future services, aboard Japanese-built &quot;bullet trains&quot;, to Stratford and Kent; the restoration and extension of Scott&apos;s hotel into a five-star Marriott Renaissance; the construction of a new gothic wing by Richard Griffiths and RHWL architects as an extension to the hotel; and flats in the upper floors of the old Midland Grand converted by the Manhattan Loft Corporation. &quot;One thing we&apos;re really proud of,&quot; says Lansley, &quot;is that we kept the Midland main line running pretty much every day, so commuters were as little inconvenienced as possible. The other thing I&apos;m particularly pleased with is the fact that passengers&apos; progress through the station, from check-in to seats on the trains, is seamless. Unlike Gare du Nord, you don&apos;t have to go upstairs to then get down to the trains. The Victorian station will be very easy to use as well, I hope, as inspiring and a lot of fun.&quot; In its new guise, and despite the security measures necessary to keep Eurostar services safe, St Pancras will remain very much a public building. A common walkway passes through the Eurostar undercroft. Anyone will be able to come here to drink at the champagne bar set alongside arriving and departing trains, to meet beneath the station&apos;s new statues of reunited lovers and of Sir John Betjeman. The station will even boast a farmers&apos; market. &quot;We wanted to make this something special, something that the rest of the railway network in Britain might aspire to,&quot; says Rob Holden, chief executive of London and Continental Railways, the company that built and runs the British end of the Channel tunnel rail link. &quot;It&apos;s taken an enormous amount of long-term planning, but I think we&apos;ve got a station every bit as glamorous as New York&apos;s Grand Central, with the bonus that here you can see the trains. Now it&apos;s time to think about a high-speed railway from St Pancras to Birmingham, Manchester and Scotland. Given the lack of engineers in Britain, the complexity of the structure of the modern railway business and the ups and downs of long-term investment, that&apos;ll best be built in stages. But this is a pretty good start.&quot; It is - and I think Scott, Barlow, Ordish, Pevsner and Betjeman might all agree. Whether you have business in Brussels, a lunch date in Paris or are simply keen to avoid airport hell, whether you are a railway buff, an engineer, curious shopper, architectural historian or a Friday-evening champagne Charlie, the new-look St Pancras is very likely to suit you. Here is a gothic fairy tale brought up to date, setting a new standard for Britain&apos;s railways, and bringing new life to one of Europe&apos;s most compelling buildings."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/11/usnews.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["The Airbus A380 makes its maiden commercial flight with Singapore Airlines on Monday - two years behind schedule."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-11T10:51:34Z", "title": "Boeing's 787 Dreamliner delayed six months", "tags": ["Business", "US news", "Airline industry", "World news"], "article": "Boeing today faced the embarrassment of demands for compensation from disappointed airlines after confirming that its prestigious new 787 Dreamliner jet would enter service six months later than planned.  In a reprise of the problems surrounding the A380 superjumbo, made by arch-rival Airbus, Boeing said last night that production and software problems with the ultra-light aircraft - largely made out of new composite materials - would delay the test flight and commercial launch of the 787.   The Airbus A380 makes its maiden commercial flight with Singapore Airlines on Monday - two years behind schedule.   Boeing, which insisted only last month that its best-selling plane was still on schedule, is blaming its delay on a shortage of parts, particularly fasteners to join the sections of carbon fibre fuselage.   The plane-maker, which has more than 700 orders for the new long-haul jet, has planned to deliver 109 Dreamliners by the end of 2009, a schedule viewed by analysts as over-ambitious given the delays.   Qantas, the Australian national carrier which has ordered 65 Dreamliners, said it would seek compensation.   The delay will affect the first 15 planes which are destined for its low-cost Jetstar airline. But both it and All Nippon Airways, the launch customer, said they did not expect any serious financial impact from the hold-up. Rolls-Royce, which is supplying engines, said this morning that it, too, sees no financial impact in 2008.   BA, which last month said it would buy 24 Dreamliners, said it was optimistic that its own order would not be affected.   &quot;We understand Boeing&apos;s need to delay the 787 programme by six months and are confident that the delay will give them time to address any issues with the aircraft&apos;s development,&quot; said a BA spokesman.   &quot;We don&apos;t believe that it will affect the timing of our orders.&quot;   Even so, the delays - affecting 15 out of 50 customers - are a serious setback for Boeing whose stock has soared in the US on the success of the 787 and expectations of record sales and earnings this year and next. The Chicago-based firm expects revenues of up to $72bn (\u00a335bn) next year, with earnings per share up to as much as $5.75.

It started with a breakfast meeting with Emma Solomon of Digital Unite who, among other things, runs the Silver Surfer of the year awards, to be handed out next week. I had looked up her headquarters on the internet and chose a place a few roads away so it would be convenient for her. I needn&apos;t have bothered. It was just an accommodation address. She and her colleagues - there are five of them - work from home, using (free) space in the Royal Festival Hall when they need to have a meeting plus a central telephone service for taking calls.

Tony Conrad - whose trendy contextual search engine sphere.com has been adopted by premium clients such as Time, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal - has 10 employees scattered around the world, and until he brought them all together recently he says he had only ever met six of them. When they set up and monitor websites for their clients they don&apos;t need even to visit their offices as it is all done remotely. Standing a few yards from him was one of Web 2.0&apos;s great successes Matt Mullenweg, whose open source blogging company WordPress is currently 22nd in the Quantcast US site rankings with more than 21 million unique visitors a month (ahead of Craigslist and just behind Wal-Mart). It is run with 17 staff around the world from New York to Australia via Singapore, and with no office. His iPhone is his HQ. He doesn&apos;t have a problem with hiring people remotely, he says, because as a developer he knows them by their coding. Although he makes sure they all meet with each other twice a year, he reaps considerable savings through having practically no overheads and not having to relocate people to Silicon Valley and pay salary scales set by Google and Yahoo!. A few minutes later I spoke to Simon Deighton, who works for MySQL - the open source database which is the mother of virtual working. Some 80% of its 400 employees work from home, keeping in touch through an internal wiki which he describes as being like an intranet except that employees can edit it. They communicate using Skype, the free internet telephone service which, he says, is like having an internal switchboard because at any one moment you can see who is on. He admits that, but for virtual working, he couldn&apos;t operate from Leeds where he lives and would have to relocate to the M4 corridor or somewhere similar. Remote working hasn&apos;t happened as speedily as a lot of pundits predicted it would years ago, probably because it involves an act of trust and a culture transplant that most companies can&apos;t easily cope with. Employees like the idea of working from home, but they are still reluctant to give up the status of a desk in the office that is a home away from home. But not so with the latest generation of web-based companies, which have no cultural legacies to maintain. They can capitalise on the new high-speed broadband era, with its promise of free international telecommunications, and learn the lessons of the open source movement that enables people to cooperate on a global basis without the traditional corporate infrastructure. If virtual working catches on it would reduce the need for international travel, give people extra leisure time - since they wouldn&apos;t need to travel to work - and would eliminate the stress of working in a corporate hierarchy. It might even bring property prices down if companies came to realise that not only do they not need a prestigious headquarters in a capital city, but they may not need an office at all. vic.keegan@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/oct/12/personaleffects", "sentences": ["Now back on the train to head south through Thailand and Malaysia to Singapore, which is about two days away then a flight to New Zealand, possibly via Australia.", "If possible, go via Changi airport (Singapore) - it&apos;s the best international airport I&apos;ve been to, and there&apos;s even a swimming pool and gardens for transit passengers.", "London to Singapore and stopover two nights, Singapore to Sydney and one or two nights stopover, then a short hop to New Zealand, which you could do economy."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-12T08:24:06Z", "title": "Is it worth paying more for business class?", "tags": ["Money"], "article": "I&apos;m desperate to go to New Zealand to see my children and granddaughter, but hate long-haul flights.

If convicted of dishonesty Mr Thaksin will have to relinquish control of City under the Premier League&apos;s &quot;fit and proper person test&quot; - a move which would sorely disappoint City fans, who have made it clear they are more interested in his wealth than his reputation. With Sven-Goran Eriksson as manager and the team riding high in the league, few are concerned about Human Rights Watch describing him as &quot;a human rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. Last month, Thai embassy officials discreetly started the extradition process with a visit to Britain seeking advice on implementing the extradition treaty between the two countries. The first charge alleges that Mr Thaksin used his influence for his wife to buy a piece of choice Bangkok real estate for a third of its estimated value. The second, added later, involves allegedly illegal transactions in the tax-free sale of the family telecoms business, Shin Corp, to a Singapore state company early last year through an opaque off-shore structure. Legislation allowing foreign entities to own up to 49% of Thai telecoms companies was passed only four days before the sale. Together with allegations of rampant cronyism, a disastrous military campaign against separatist Muslims in the south and an arrogant propensity to muzzle his critics, it was the Shin Corp sale which sparked opposition outrage and the military coup. The junta, which has promised elections at the end of December, may have an uphill struggle in pressing its case. The British government has little appetite for helping a military junta to put a legitimately elected politician on trial."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/13/topstories3.burma", "sentences": ["&quot;They transferred their money to Singapore, many millions of dollars,&quot; claimed the businessman as he chatted calmly but wearily about the contempt felt by the people toward the military."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-12T23:21:57Z", "title": "After the riots, Burma returns to an unspoken terror", "tags": ["World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "It&apos;s 9.30pm and the buses in downtown Rangoon have stopped running. People scuttle home across the city&apos;s potholed roads and broken pavements and the few taxis still operating will only make short trips. With only 30 minutes to curfew, no one takes chances with the Burmese military these days. Carrying shotguns and assault rifles, teenagers in military and police uniforms cluster at street corners until curfew, then retreat to fenced-off government buildings as darkness settles. When the residents of this sprawling city of five million people withdraw to their homes, only pick-up trucks carrying troops ply the downtown area, scattering the dogs that take over the empty streets until the curfew ends at 4am. With the killing of an unknowable number of peaceful protesters and the imprisonment of thousands more during the pro-democracy demonstrations last month, many people fear reprisals by the military. At the Shwedagon pagoda, the nucleus of the protests, the military is still in force. Wearing steel helmets, flak jackets and carrying extra ammunition, the number of troops far exceeds the few old monks who potter among the golden spires of what is the spiritual centre of Burmese life. At the pagoda&apos;s eastern gate, from which the monks began their days of peaceful marches around Rangoon, six fire trucks - the type used to water cannon crowds, not put out blazes - are stationed. Dozens of monastic houses lining the route to the gate remain locked and empty, despite reports in Burma&apos;s state-controlled media that most of the monks have been released from jail. Sources said that around 1,000 monks had lived and studied at these small monasteries, but where they have gone is not a question that anyone ponders aloud. One man simply put his wrists together in the sign of locked handcuffs when asked where they are. &quot;We cannot speak. We cannot defend. We have no weapons. They have all the weapons,&quot; said another 30-year-old man, who cannot be identified for his own safety. He, like many thousands of others, joined the monks in the early part of the protests, before the killing. What most people know is that when the military and police moved to crush the demonstrations they went after the monks under the cover of darkness - kicking in doors and bundling monks, young and old, into trucks. Buddhist nuns were also taken away. The military were too powerful to be beaten by peaceful protests but some feel that the attacks and the disappearance of the Buddhist clergy will be the undoing of General Than Shwe, the Burmese junta&apos;s leader. &quot;We are a Buddhist country. We believe that if you do good, you receive good. If you do bad things you receive bad things. This will be the same for the military,&quot; said the 30-year-old. The military announced, in the New Light of Myanmar newspaper, that monks and nuns taken in the raids were defrocked before interrogation and those found to not have participated in the demonstrations were reordained and sent back to their monasteries. &quot;The handling of the situation during the violent protests and measures taken by officials for purification of the Sasana [religion] amounts to serving the interest of the Sasana,&quot; the paper added. &quot;Officials are to make continued efforts for perpetuation, purification and propagation of the Sasana.&quot; Barricades remain stacked beside pavements, in the centre of wider roads and in alleys ready for use, though after the crushing of the recent protests none of those spoken to in Rangoon seem to have the stomach for more - just yet. Many of those who took part in the protests, even as onlookers, have fled to the countryside fearing the ongoing night-time sweeps by the intelligence services who video-taped demonstrators and are now putting names to faces. In the aftermath of the protests the military has cut the country&apos;s internet connection to stem the flood of protest images to the outside world. Cable TV, however, remains connected and residents in Rangoon watched the brutal crackdown in their city on TV sets tuned to CNN and the BBC. In shops and hotel lobbies, Burmese staff whisper: &quot;Have you seen CNN? Have you seen what happened?&quot; Many said that the world had now seen the true face of their leaders thanks to images smuggled out of the country. They hope that the international media attention will make a difference, though none believe the generals are anywhere near allowing democracy or handing over control of the country. The Burmese follow the &quot;three monkeys rule,&quot; said a 45-year-old businessman as he sipped a cup of coffee overlooking the street corner where the Japanese cameraman, Kenji Nagai, 50, was shot dead on September 27. &quot;We see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. That is the way to survive. But inside we know,&quot; he said. &quot;I heard the Japanese cameraman worked in Afghanistan and Iraq, but did not die. Here in Burma they shot him dead,&quot; he said, dropping his voice to explain why he left the demonstrations early, he added: &quot;I have a wife and three children. If I am killed they will have nothing.&quot; Thousands were killed in pro-democracy protests in Rangoon in 1988 which the businessman also witnessed and supported. Since then the military has grown richer, stronger and has invested more in maintaining power, he said. The demonstrations had little chance of toppling the military but he believed the latest show of defiance gave the generals the jitters. A story that was repeated by several sources claimed that the wives and children of the junta had left the country for Dubai, some said Laos, in the early days of the demonstrations, while their husbands hunkered down in the country&apos;s new jungle capital, Naypyidaw, to coordinate the military&apos;s response. &quot;They transferred their money to Singapore, many millions of dollars,&quot; claimed the businessman as he chatted calmly but wearily about the contempt felt by the people toward the military. Midway through he stopped abruptly, his face drained and he moved in his chair, twisting his body away from two men sitting silently at a nearby table. &quot;They are listening. They are special police,&quot; he said, politely ending the conversation and leaving. In this city that quietly seethes with anti-government resentment, the people are terrified of the spies of the intelligence services. Burma&apos;s state-run TV channels and newspapers have been packed since last week with footage of big pro-government demonstrations in provincial areas. In daily, full-page notices in newspapers and frequent TV announcements the public are warned against tuning into the &quot;traitors,&quot; &quot;saboteurs,&quot; and &quot;neo-colonialists&quot; at the BBC, Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. The generals are &quot;gangsters&quot;, said one man with overseas experience, but the economic sanctions by western nations simply benefit China and Asian nations that are still content to do business with the junta, particularly in the fields of gas, oil and other natural resources, which Burma has in abundance. &quot;Democracy does not fit well in Burma, the generals are gangsters but at least they can run things. These democracy parties have no experience of running the country,&quot; he added. The military may not even want the western foreign investment that is being denied them through sanctions - with investment comes influence both cultural and economic. &quot;The military have everything they need. They don&apos;t like the influence of western culture, because then they would have to change,&quot; he added. &quot;All this is hurting the very poor, they cannot go about their business.&quot; But the Burmese security forces are not a monolith and many of the rank and file in this Buddhist nation may fear the religious implications of the attacks on the monasteries and the continued detentions of monks. Earlier this week, at Shwedagon pagoda, a light rain fell as the last few worshippers trickled up the stairways to the hilltop temple carrying offerings of flowers and incense. Small groups of men and women sat on reed mats meditating and reciting mantras at the pavilions at the top of each stairway. Among them was one young man who kneeled, not to mediate but to ask forgiveness. At 26, this man had been a police officer for six years and had risen to become a plainclothes officer. When the night swoops on the monasteries began, he was ordered to take part. On Monday night he deposited his police uniform and weapon at his station before coming to the pagoda for one last visit before fleeing to the Thai border. It&apos;s an act of betrayal that will mean several years&apos; imprisonment if he is caught. As he rose from his knees he said: &quot;I have had enough. I have to leave.&quot; Then with two other young men he started out on the journey to the border and the refugee camps where tens of thousands of Burmese have fled before him."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/14/money.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["We finally get to the almost two-year delay over the launch of the A380, the giant Airbus plane which is being formally delivered to its first customer, Singapore Airlines, this week."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-13T23:33:02Z", "title": "Interview: Willie Walsh, British Airways chief executive", "tags": ["Business", "Money", "Airline industry"], "article": "Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, is a glutton for punishment. He is ordering me to read out my pre-prepared list of the disasters of almost Biblical proportions that have befallen the airline in the two years he has been at the controls. It would be enough to send most bosses running screaming from the room, but he insists on hearing it. So to recap: in the past two years BA has been hit by strikes; fines for price fixing; bomb plots; ongoing chaos at Heathrow; climate change protests; and a public rebuke from the Archbishop of Canterbury for refusing to allow a Christian employee to wear a crucifix to work. It seems rude to go on with the roll-call of shame. But Walsh is having none of it. &apos;Go on, read the rest,&apos; he urges with relish. We finally get to the almost two-year delay over the launch of the A380, the giant Airbus plane which is being formally delivered to its first customer, Singapore Airlines, this week. British Airways had originally been rumoured to be one of the first customers. &apos;Ah ha,&apos; he points triumphantly, &apos;that one - the delay over the A380 launch - is not our fault.&apos; Walsh claps his hands and laughs. &apos;I look back and remember the things which went well,&apos; he says. Fortunately, he is not easily offended. The Irishman, who joined Aer Lingus as a 17-year-old trainee pilot in 1979, worked his way up to chief executive in 2001, before being poached by BA. We&apos;re sitting in a small nondescript office at BA&apos;s glass-panelled headquarters complex near Heathrow Terminal 2, just over two years after he took up the job on 1 October 2005. He says the biggest challenge was coping when flights were grounded over fears of a terrorist plot last August. The new security measures introduced at all UK airports overnight almost brought Heathrow - already the UK&apos;s most over-stretched airport - to its knees as owner BAA struggled to cope. Walsh decided publicly to lambast the airport operator, which did not go down well with BAA boss Stephen Nelson, not least because the two companies tend not to criticise each other openly. &apos;I did feel strongly,&apos; Walsh recalls. &apos;I thought long and hard before I did it. I&apos;d expressed frustration to them and I felt someone had to say something. It&apos;s not something I did lightly.&apos; Asked if it damaged the relationship, he laughs: &apos;Yes, it did. Let&apos;s be honest, people don&apos;t like being criticised, particularly in public. It [the relationship] was a bit icy.&apos; BA is BAA&apos;s largest customer, with two-thirds of its flights taking off from Heathrow. Walsh insists relations have improved since last summer&apos;s hiatus but bemoans the lack of investment in Heathrow over the years. What irks Walsh most about the security measures is the rule limiting passengers taking off from UK airports to one piece of hand luggage. People flying into the UK are allowed to carry two pieces of hand luggage, which they have to shove into one when taking off again. &apos;I can see no justifiable reason why it&apos;s in place. It&apos;s continuing to impact on our business and reputation.&apos; Ruth Kelly, the new Secretary of State for Transport, is reviewing the rule and Walsh hopes the restrictions will be lifted in &apos;weeks not months&apos;. BAA, which was bought by Spanish construction group Ferrovial last year, has been referred to the Competition Commission to investigate whether its stranglehold over London&apos;s airports - it owns Stansted and Gatwick, as well as Heathrow - constitutes a monopoly. Other airlines, such as Virgin Atlantic, are calling for BAA to be broken up and ownership of the London airports split. Walsh argues that forcing BAA to sell one or more of its airports would not improve customer service. The real problem of having one company owning most of the south east&apos;s airports, he says, is that there is little incentive for it to increase capacity. &apos;We have suffered as a result because they can say: &quot;If there&apos;s inadequate capacity it will spill to another one of my airports; I&apos;m going to get the business anyway.&quot; If there was separate ownership you can be damned sure the guy who owns Heathrow will say &quot;I&apos;m not going to allow my competitor to benefit&quot;.&apos; But despite this he still believes a forced break-up of BAA would be messy and result in further chaos, and should be used only as a last resort. Far better, he argues, would be for the regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to set mandatory targets for airport owners to increase the amount of aircraft and passengers it can handle. &apos;If BAA gave commitments to capacity development and if the regulatory regime required it to deliver on those commitments, that may be an acceptable and more practical alternative to it breaking up.&apos; In the meantime, BA is getting ready for the March opening of the spanking new Terminal 5, which will handle all BA flights. &apos;Believe me when I say it - T5 is going to make a massive difference and will be fantastic from a customer point of view.&apos; He shows me his security pass, which is adorned with the cheesy company slogan - &apos;Fit for Five&apos;. So far the schedule is on time and on budget but he concedes that cynical passengers, fed up with Heathrow, will believe it only when they see it. Three days after the opening of Terminal 5 is another milestone date - when the &apos;Open Skies&apos; agreement on flights between Europe and the US comes into force. Currently, only four airlines can fly between Heathrow - which handles most transatlantic flights in Europe - and the US, including BA and Virgin Atlantic. But, from the end of March, any airline will be able to fly to and from the two continents. BA has the most to lose from the agreement, as it operates the most flights from the UK to the US. Controversially, the US won a two-year moratorium on opening its own domestic market to European airlines. Until then, only US carriers can fly domestic routes. Walsh, not surprisingly, says this isn&apos;t fair. &apos;The US is saying &quot;your skies are open, ours are closed&quot; - that&apos;s its definition of open skies,&apos; he says. &apos;It&apos;s a poor settlement.&apos; He predicts the US will not meet its side of the bargain by opening its domestic market by 2010. But rather than cut back the number of BA flights to the US as new competitors start their own, he says the airline will increase the number of flights. The amiable Walsh saves his ire for the government. Last week it said it would replace the much-hated air passenger duty with a tax on flights to encourage airlines to fill planes and, in so doing, cut pollution. &apos;It&apos;s bullshit really,&apos; he says. &apos;They&apos;re just raising revenues.&apos; He remains remarkably chipper, despite everything: &apos;When I started my flying career the joke was that Heathrow was the only building site in the world which had its own airport.&apos; Come March, if Terminal 5 and Open Skies don&apos;t go as smoothly as Walsh the eternal optimist predicts, he&apos;ll need his sense of humour more than ever.

The South African, six times a winner of golf&apos;s richest first prize, added a seventh title to his resum\u00e9 and \u00a31m to his bank balance yesterday with a 6&amp;4 defeat of the US Open champion Angel Cabrera. In fact, it was a demolition more than a victory. By the time the pair walked on to the 14th green of their afternoon round Els had racked up 12 birdies and faced a 10-footer to close out the match with a 13th. In the end his putter was not required as the Argentinian failed to chip-in from the rough and surrendered. &quot;I wish I could take Wentworth around the world,&quot; the South African said afterwards - a psychical impossibility of course but an understandable sentiment. This upmarket golf club straddling the border of Surrey and Berkshire has been unimaginably kind to Els over the years, as has this tournament. He has been in eight finals and lost only once, to Vijay Singh. His record is, played 31, won 26. His seven wins have been worth \u00a33.75m. But if Wentworth echoes with past glories for Els, his performance yesterday offered him a tantalising hint that Nirvana may just be around the corner. Since coming back from a six-month break following a knee injury in the summer of 2005 the South African has been out of sorts, neither the easy-going personality of reputation nor the magnificent golfer who once offered the greatest challenge to Tiger Woods&apos;s dominance. He has won two events in that time but both minor ones. In any case, the brief moments of success have been fair outweighed by disappointments, the latest of which came only two weeks ago when he played himself into contention down the stretch at the Dunhill Links at St Andrews only to take a triple-bogey seven at the 16th hole after putting into a bunker. &quot;I don&apos;t care how many years you have been in the profession, if you have a stuff-up like that it sticks in your mind for a while. You have to just try your best to get it out of your mind,&quot; he said yesterday. Clearly, Els&apos;s best was good enough. He played moderately in his semi-final match against Henrik Stenson but otherwise this week he has looked every inch a golfer with three majors to his credit. Cabrera gifted him the 1st hole in yesterday&apos;s final when he failed to get down in two from a greenside bunker but thereafter the South African earned everything that came his way with some sensational putting. &quot;It might seem that I&apos;m a very patient guy but the truth is I&apos;m a very impatient person when it comes to getting results, and I haven&apos;t had the results go my way this year either in Europe or in America. I&apos;ve finished second or lost in play-offs or been there or thereabouts. So to win and play the way I did this week is very satisfying,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully, this will open up doors for me and lead to some other wins.&quot; It can be taken as read that this was a reference to next year&apos;s Masters, a tournament where Els has done everything through the years but depart the premises wearing a green blazer. What it was not a reference, too, however, is the European tour Order of Merit - an accolade he has never won. Yesterday&apos;s victory put Els at the top of the European money, ahead of Padraig Harrington and Justin Rose, but he will not be taking part in the end-of-season event where the title is usually decided. In what the European tour will no doubt describe as a scheduling conflict - unkind souls would say cock-up - the Volvo Masters at Valderrama will tee off at the same time as an event in Singapore where a number of leading players, the South African included, are thought to be receiving hefty incentives to play. Suffice to say, Els will not be changing his plans. &quot;The end of the year is when you get the wheelbarrow out. You have got to cash in,&quot; he said. After yesterday&apos;s pay-day he will no doubt take to a trip to the garden centre some time this week to buy himself a new wheelbarrow. \u00b7 The following clarification was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday October 22 2007. We were wrong to say that Ernie Els has never won the European Order of Merit.

He was a key man in the ruling junta, ranking third in the hierarchy: viewed as a hardliner who was close to the current leader, General Than Shwe, he is associated with some of the bloodiest events of the last two decades. Unsurprisingly for a political leadership that cherishes secrecy and subterfuge, little is known of Soe Win&apos;s upbringing and background. He was born in 1948, the same year as the country achieved independence from the UK, after a long and bitter struggle. This history was to leave deep scars, some of which remain unhealed to this day and lurk behind the country&apos;s current troubles. After a brief period as a democratic republic from 1948 to 1962, Burma was transferred to military rule after the putsch led by General Ne Win. It has remained under military control since, despite elections in 1990 which overwhelmingly returned the National League for Democracy Party of Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of General Aung San, who had been instrumental in negotiating independence from the British until his assassination by rivals in 1947; those elections were ignored. Soe Win was an archetypal creature of the highly militarised culture which he was born into and grew up in, an environment in which the army alone had true institutional strength and authority. He graduated from the Defence Services Academy in Rangoon, and first came to attention in 1988, when he was commander in charge of troops that gunned down students at Rangoon University and Rangoon hospital during the repression that occurred as a result of economic problems that year. More than 3000 protesters are thought to have died. He was appointed commander of the north-west regional area in 1990, and regional commander and member of the central junta in 1997. In 2001, he was made air defence general, and secretary two in the State Peace and Development Council, the highest-level decision-making body. It was in this position that he was involved in what has become known as the Dipeyin massacre, on May 30 2003. Dipeyin is a small town in central Burma just outside Rangoon. Aung San Suu Kyi was enjoying one of the very brief periods when she was allowed free movement, after being under house arrest for much of the previous decade. Her journey outside the capital was seen as deliberately provocative by some in the leadership. Their response was brutal. Her car cavalcade was attacked by a group of government-supported heavies, holding iron bars and wooden sticks. Dozens died, and the event brought international condemnation to the regime. Soe Win was claimed to be the commander with direct control over the region in which the incident happened, earning himself the label &quot;the butcher of Dipeyin&quot;. There was a brief period of speculation during 2004 that the regime, under the then prime minister, and former head of intelligence, Khin Nyunt, was starting to move towards compromise with opposition groups. Khin announced a Seven Point Roadmap to Democracy, and recalled the National Congress. He was perceived as being more moderate and willing to engage with the outside world. He was, however, running against the powerful hardliners in the party, particularly General Than and his deputy General Myong, who removed him from power in October of that year. He has since been sentenced to 41 years in prison on unspecified corruption charges. Soe Win was immediately appointed secretary one and prime minister. His period in office over the last three years has seen the worsening of Burma&apos;s economic situation and further isolation by the regime, culminating in the events of September and October this year in which thousands of monks and students took to the streets to demonstrate. Soe Win travelled abroad sporadically, visiting China in 2005, where he was received by the premier there, Wen Jiabao. He also visited Thailand. In March 2007, he was admitted to hospital in Singapore, suffering from leukaemia. He returned to Burma in October, and, after a previous misreporting of his death, the Burmese government officially announced his demise on October 12. It is unlikely that Soe&apos;s death will have any impact on the regime&apos;s current strategy, which seems to be to continue to resist reform and making any concessions to the opposition. Burma remains economically impoverished and politically volatile, recently attracting the criticism and frustration of even its long-term allies China and Russia. Soe Win was a Buddhist, who, opposition groups claimed, had been involved in the persecution of Christians. He is survived by his wife, daughter and son.

This most prosaic and basic of commercial transactions - a supplier handing over goods to a customer - attracted the world&apos;s media and a throng of 500 to the European planemaker&apos;s offices in Toulouse. Still, that was nothing compared to the unveiling of the double-decker plane in 2005, which attracted a crowd of 10,000 and French, German and British leaders to gawp at the outside (they were not allowed on board, since that was not finished). And excitement will reach fever pitch tomorrow, when Singapore Airlines actually puts the double-decker plane on its maiden commercial flight. Tickets for that jaunt have been selling on eBay for as much as \u00a350,000. Such excitability is understandable among aviation executives; they at least have the excuse that their jobs are on the line. The time and cost of designing and making an airplane (the A380 was conceived back in 1994), and the very limited number of customers for long-haul planes, makes it vital to eke every ounce of available PR out of each aspect of the process. If a model does not attract excitement, it may struggle to get buyers. But why do others act as their cheerleaders? The flying double decker was launched with promises that its 5,920 square feet of passenger space would fit a cocktail bar or a duty-free lounge. The press dutifully wrote all this down - but few asked who really wanted a casino. For those in cattle class getting a seat by the window is enough of a high-stakes game. Journalists are not the only people to give the aviation firms such indulgence; politicians do, too. Airbus gets generous loans from European governments (termed &quot;launch aid&quot; by the Americans), while Boeing is financially supported by Washington. In other words, taxpayers&apos; money props up an industry that turns out goods of doubtful benefit to the rest of society - and harmful to the environment. Just as there was no great public demand for a flying casino, so few would notice if this jet model or that went without some incremental improvement or other. Politicians get a bit misty-eyed over anything combining technological innovation with the creation of a national industrial champion - that was what enabled the creation of Concorde. But there is an obvious, glaring contradiction between governments subsidising the plane industry - and combating climate change. The aviation business is an odd, idiosyncratic thing, but it is a business all the same. It is about time we stopped treating it as a huge romance."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/16/theairlineindustry.travel", "sentences": ["European plane-maker Airbus yesterday rebutted reports that its flagship A380 superjumbo was suffering further production delays as it handed over the first aircraft to Singapore Airlines at a ceremony in Toulouse.", "The world&apos;s biggest jet, billed as greener, cleaner and quieter than Boeing&apos;s venerable 747 jumbo, will make its first scheduled commercial flight on October 28 after a charity excursion between Singapore and Sydney on October 25.", "The jet, which can fly 9,320 miles non-stop, can carry between 525 and 800 passengers on two decks - although Singapore Airlines has installed just 471 seats.", "Singapore yesterdayshowed off its personal cabins in its A380s, pictured above, allowing first-class passengers to travel in a secluded environment."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-16T09:15:40Z", "title": "Airbus delivers first A380", "tags": ["Business", "Airline industry", "Travel", "EADS", "Airbus"], "article": "European plane-maker Airbus yesterday rebutted reports that its flagship A380 superjumbo was suffering further production delays as it handed over the first aircraft to Singapore Airlines at a ceremony in Toulouse.

No one sustained serious injuries in the incident, but all passengers on the aircraft were evacuated and transported to the terminal building where they had to board alternative flights. BAA, the Spanish-owned operator of Heathrow, confirmed that there had been an incident shortly after 10pm. &quot;There are no reported injuries and passengers are in the process of being uplifted from the aircraft,&quot; a spokesman said. The British Airways Boeing 747 departing for Singapore and a Sri Lankan Airlines Airbus A340 had &quot;clipped&quot; while taxiing, according to the London Fire Brigade. The fire brigade was stood down when it was clear no passengers had been hurt and there were no signs of fire or damage. A spokesman for British Airways described the incident on flight BA011 as a &quot;minor collision&quot; and said an investigation had been launched. Engineers were inspecting the aircraft. The episode will do little to improve the reputation of Heathrow as an overcrowded hub that is struggling to deal with 200,000 passengers passing through its terminals every day. BAA has announced a \u00a36.2bn spending programme to improve facilities after terminal 5 opens next March. But Spanish group Ferrovial, which owns BAA, has admitted that runway capacity is its biggest limitation. BAA is campaigning for a third runway that would provide capacity for an extra 240,000 flights each year; many of these will be tourist flights or short-haul business flights which environmental campaigners have argued should be replaced by different forms of transport. Under government proposals to be put to public consultation, the number of take-offs and landings from Heathrow would nearly double from 480,000 to 800,000 a year by adding a runway for short-haul flights by 2020 and expanding the use of existing runways."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/oct/16/travelnews.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["The quieter, faster, greener &quot;superjumbo&quot;, variously hailed yesterday at a glitzy ceremony in Toulouse, France, as &quot;the defining aircraft of its generation&quot;, &quot;a new queen of the skies&quot; and &quot;the product that will change the face of the industry&quot;, could in principle carry a respectable 853 passengers, but in this particular configuration for Singapore Airlines, which introduces it next week on its Singapore-Sydney route, it will carry little more than half that.", "This is because Singapore Airlines has asked chic French luxury yacht designer Jean-Jacques Coste to create 12 ultra-luxurious suites down what would normally be the central aisle of the plane.", "There is a 23in LCD screen for watching any of the 100 movies on the entertainment system while dining from an international menu put together by Gordon Ramsay and colleagues from France, Australia and Singapore.", "Before you all rush, however, a word or two to the wise: suites will cost between 20% and 25% more than the standard one-way first-class fare, which on the airline&apos;s Singapore-London route, for example, is a mere \u00a32,527.40."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-16T22:46:18Z", "title": "Jon Henley on the first Airbus A380, the quieter, faster, greener \"superjumbo\"", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"], "article": "You are looking at the interior of the first Airbus A380 to be delivered to an airline.

Subs: Marshall, McEveley, Dailly, Robson, Teale, Beattie, Boyd. Referee: Knut Kircher (Germany). The national anthems: Flower of Scotland is given a nice plodding bassline on parping tuba, while the Georgian is a close-harmony affair, a bit like the theme to Eurovision, plus a couple of chord changes which throw the casual listener. And we&apos;re off: Scotland, playing in traditional, er, limited-edition maroon, set the ball rolling with an aimless hoof upfield. Less of that, please. 2 min: There&apos;s an awful lot of whistling going on, perhaps in protest at the current inability of all 22 players to control the ball. 3 min: Not much of a start this, I can tell you that for nothing. 4 min: The 17-year-old Kenia looks confident, tearing down the right wing and playing a decent ball across the face of the Scotland box which not one of his team-mates reads or reacts to. &quot;Can you keep an eye on McFadden for me please?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. &quot;I don&apos;t want him getting hurt and jeopardising his 80th minute introduction to the Merseyside derby come Saturday lunchtime. Decent of the Premier League to have scheduled that match for 12.45pm - it saves the likes of McFadden, Lescott, Gerrard and Neville sleeping at all between now and their biggest club game of the season.&quot; 5 min: A good start from Georgia, this; they win a corner after some good work from Siradze; the resulting kick is dealt with easily by Weir. 7 min: &quot;I am sat next to Graeme Souness on the train to Manchester and after his reaction to the England result would like to be the first to tell him about a Georgia goal,&quot; writes Tim Buckingham. &quot;Any joy?&quot; Afraid not, but Kvirkvelia nearly splits the Scottish defence with a pass that McManus does well to clear. Scotland want to watch this, they&apos;ve started slowly. 8 min: This is better: Alexander sprays a ball down the left towards Miller, whose first-time low cross is met in the centre by McFadden, who rushes in and sidefoots this much wide of the left-hand post. So nearly the opener. 10 min: Shashiashvili nearly gets behind Murty down the left, but the Reading full-back does well to slide in and clear. After a slow start, this is turning into half-decent end-to-end stuff. 12 min: The match ball, having been mindlessly kicked in the face Goleo VI style, is jiggered, rather like domestic victim Pille the Erudite Ball. The deflated orb is hoofed out of play and traded in for a younger, more beautiful model. 16 min: GOAL!!! Georgia 1 - 0 Scotland. Weir meets a deep Georgian cross - one that was floating out of play - with the toppermost of his head; that&apos;s a needless corner. Menteshashvili takes; and McHedlidze crashes a header past a helpless Gordon and into the net. What a great goal from Georgia&apos;s point of view, but oh dear oh dear. I&apos;d like to hear how Graeme Souness reacts to this. Tim Buckingham, do your worst. 17 min: Fletcher embarks on a Maradonaesque (well, it is) run down the right and into the box. He falls - but is not bundled - over, and the ball is cleared. A good response, though. As is this: a goal flies in, and within a minute, the conspiracy theorists are already up in arms. &quot;Tell Gary Naylor to stop bumping his gums,&quot; writes Claire MacKenzie. &quot;There&apos;s the small matter of the SFA having scheduled an Old Firm derby a whole 15 mins earlier at 12.30pm on Saturday, which in NO WAY WHATSOEVER has anything to do with Gary Naismith et al pulling out of this game, oh no sir.&quot; 20 min: Tell you what, this Kenia looks decent. Once again he jigs and jinks down the right, causing Alexander and McManus problems as he stands on the spot and shakes his booty like a modern-day Steve Nicol. Actually, that&apos;s not a very pleasant image, is it. Guardian Unlimited Football: a hotline to the stars! &quot;I am on a train to Manchester,&quot; writes, er, Graeme Souness from his long-standing email account graemesounessonthetrain@googlemail.com, &quot;and the tit next to me told me that Scotland are already a goal down. Is this true? In case it is, I have started weeping.&quot; 25 min: Scotland are seeing plenty of the ball, but not doing a great deal with it. More often than not it&apos;s passed around at the back for a while, then eventually hoofed witlessly up one of the flanks, where any slim chance of creating bother is immediately lost. Meanwhile, according to Tim Buckingham, Souness&apos;s actual response was: Plenty of time, don&apos;t you worry. &quot;A disappointing retort from the great man,&quot; adds Buckingham. &quot;Perhaps another Georgia goal needed to stoke up the old fire?&quot; Actually, will you please stop this? 28 min: CORNER FOR SCOTLAND!!! Yes, that&apos;s right! They have won one! McFadden takes it, only for McManus to crash a header miles over the bar for three of the rugby points. &quot;Steve Nicol takes a size-16 shoe,&quot; writes Christopher Collins, who may or may not be lying through his teeth, but I can&apos;t say I&apos;m bothered much either way. &quot;I have an unhappy image of a clown-shoed 80s Soviet Bond baddie jinking down Scotland&apos;s flank.&quot; 32 min: This is more like it from Scotland. More like the old Scotland, that is: they can&apos;t string two passes together at the moment. Bah. Meanwhile the owner of the email account graemesounessonthetrain@googlemail.com - who for the record is surely Graeme Souness, definitely no question about that - has promised to &quot;sort Tim Buckingham out&quot;. 34 min: There is a clown on the pitch. One not wearing Scotland maroon, that is. Some dolt in a car coat jogs around for a while, before being shoved to the ground by several police officers waving sticks. 35 min: That should have been a penalty for Scotland, as McFadden shapes to scoot past Shashiashvili and is stopped from doing so by a bloody great thigh. 36 min: It&apos;s all happening: McHedlidze takes a shot from outside the box which Gordon does well to parry clear, then McFadden nearly breaks clear down the other end, but takes one touch too many and can&apos;t get his shot in on goal as three defenders swarm round him. Good match this now. 39 min: What an effort from - who else? - McFadden, who outside the box and with his back to goal, brings down a dropping ball with his thigh, juggles it as he turns round, and sends a dipping volley just over the bar. Oh, and a wee bit wide. Which makes the effort sound far worse than it was. 41 min: McFadden is upended in the centre of the park. Fletcher goes to take the resulting free kick quickly - and is pulled back by some saucy Georgian sod. When it&apos;s eventually taken, the free kick is simply dreadful. Scotland haven&apos;t tested the 17-year-old keeper once here; Alex McLeish is on the sideline in a funk which is hot. 43 min: Pearson and Miller combine nicely down the left to nearly send the former free; he can only win a corner, though. Maloney&apos;s set piece is half decent and nearly finds the head of McManus, but with the young keeper flapping, Asatiani takes charge and heads clear. Half-time: Georgia 1 - 0 Scotland. Well, that&apos;s about right, the Scots can have no real complaints about that; their marking at the goal was dreadful and they created next to nothing up front. Still, they enjoyed a lot of possession, that&apos;s got to count for someth... hold on, no it doesn&apos;t. Very poor. &quot;Oh Scott, I love it when you smoke your cigarettes,&quot; writes an anonymous reader who may or may not exist. Well, I live to make you happy. Back in a sec. I&apos;m high on nicotine. And Flavia English Breakfast Tea flavour drink, sucked straight from the Filterpak. And life! So enough of this pessimism. Scotland can still do this if they get their gamefaces on. Not that you lot are in similar mood. Gordon Lunan is personally blaming the Guardian right now for headlines such as &quot;Scotland confident of a Georgia win&quot;. Sorry about those. Meanwhile Jon Cummins is blaming himself: &quot;Like a fool I decided to watch the game in English instead of the French feed I got for the Ukraine game after a friend ridiculed my superstitious nature.&quot; Oh dear. &quot;But don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m switching back to my completely legal French feed, 2-1 Scotland, I can feel it!&quot; Well, that&apos;s a bit better, isn&apos;t it.

Harbouring Serious Reservations About The Mental Well-Being Of Guardian Unlimited Football&apos;s Readership pt.II: &quot;It&apos;s 4am here in Sydney and in my mildly hallucinating state of total panic, Scott, you are becoming more and more attractive to me,&quot; writes Tracy Scott. &quot;Are you single? We share the same name - it must be a sign, no?&quot; Oh me, oh my, you really need some sleep, don&apos;t you. It&apos;ll be alright in the morning, promise. Meanwhile Nick Shearer is &quot;going to lock myself in the company lav with the prehistoric white wine I found in the fridge. Why, Lord, why?&quot; And we&apos;re off again! A minute of the half gone already, and have any Scottish players showcased their ability to trap the ball with anything other than their shins or teeth? You can answer that yourselves, can&apos;t you. 47 min: Asatiani plays a suicidal ball across the face of his own box; McFadden nearly latches onto it but Youngkeeper (it&apos;s easier to spell) does brilliantly to react, rushing out and walloping miles upfield. 50 min: McHedlidze - he&apos;s only 17 for goodness sake - looks quite a player. Not only has he scored the goal, now he&apos;s haring up and down the right wing, twisting poor Alexander in knots. He&apos;s so unlucky as he executes a Cruyff Turn in the box which is only this much too heavy of touch, sending the ball out of play instead of into space in the box. Meanwhile it&apos;s getting clammy in here, as Melissa F appreciates the fact I am &quot;not afraid to use the words &quot;saucy&quot; and &quot;hot&quot;, and I could only imagine the sight of that rather large Georgian thigh you mentioned since I watched them on the weekend vs. Italy.&quot; Just trying to spread the love, that&apos;s all I&apos;m doing, spreading the love. 53 min: Pearson and Fletcher combine nicely in the centre of the park to release Maloney, who weaves towards the Georgian box and is upended. That, sir, is a foul, and a free kick results. It&apos;s just left of the D, 20 yards out. Maloney stands over it himself and... oh for goodness sake. WITH A 17-YEAR OLD DEBUTANT IN GOAL, SCOTLAND STILL HAVEN&apos;T HAD A SHOT ON TARGET as the free kick is dinked over the wall and bounces harmlessly wide left, and at no great speed to boot. &quot;This is turning into The Naked Lunch,&quot; writes Chris Collins. &quot;While masochists in other time zones are at least in bed, nursing cans of booze or hallucinating, I am having to put my best corporate face on as people ask me questions about sales margins while a world of turmoil goes on inside my head.&quot; You should try sitting here. 56 min: Another free kick for Scotland, this time further out left. Maloney curls a free kick into a crowded area; it&apos;s easily cleared by Shashiashvili. How quickly the old days have returned. I knew it. I just knew it. Total time of your minute-by-minute reporter&apos;s boundless optimism: 11 min. 58 min: McFadden goes down for a bit there, and for a moment looks in some distress, but he&apos;s soon up again. 61 min: Georgia&apos;s other excellent teenager, Kenia, goes to ground under a decent looking challenge from McManus. Free kick, just outside the box; booking to the Scotland centre-back. Kankava is also booked for an over-zealous display of anger at the &quot;foul&quot;. Kvirkvelia&apos;s kick is brilliant, dipping from 25 yards centrally towards the top-right corner; Gordon&apos;s response is equally wonderful, as he tips over for a corner. From which comes nothing. 64 min: THAT&apos;S IT, I&apos;D SAY. Georgia 2 - 0 Scotland. Murty is beaten all ends up down the left by Kvirkvelia, who cuts back to Siradze; the ball is sidefooted calmly past Gordon. Oh dear. The immediate reaction: Miller and Pearson are replaced by Boyd and Beattie. 67 min: Siradze is kicked full in the face by a high-kicking Weir. The resulting free kick is basically a corner from the left; Menteshashvili curls it towards the back post and Boyd does well to head clear. This is all Georgia and Scotland is rocking. Tim Buckingham, who is in the immediate environs of Graeme Souness on a Manchester-bound train, would like someone who knows him to call him for a loud chat about the rugby. 70 min: The ball isn&apos;t sticking up front for Scotland at all, despite the composition of the team being roughly 66% striker. Beattie is booked for scything down Kenia. &quot;Awful performance this by the Scots,&quot; writes Rob Edwards. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen a performance this bad since the girlfriend tried to explain a new scratch on the bumper of my car. Sir Anthony Hopkins she is not.&quot; 73 min: Beattie gets on the end of a deep left-wing cross, but his header from six yards out flies well over the bar. &quot;Watching the marking in the area for both goals,&quot; wonders Patrick Groden, &quot;will the chant from the Georgians be: Are you England in disguise?&quot; 74 min: SCOTLAND HAVE A SHOT ON TARGET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, you read it right, they really have had one! Beattie is the man, taking a free kick from nearly 40 yards out which Youngkeeper (a spit for Napoleon Dynamite, incidentally) smothers with ease. 76 min: This is over. Maloney goes over in the box under heat from Asatiani, but he knows full well there&apos;s nothing in the challenge and his appeals for a penalty are nearly as half-arsed as Scotland&apos;s overall performance. Ed Haag has taken to quoting Sean Connery, who once said: &quot;Scotland are fulfilling their self-appointed role as tragic losers.&quot; You&apos;ve got that straight. 78 min: Kandelaki replaces young Kenia, who has been fantastic. 79 min: McFadden slides in at the right-hand post in an attempt to meet a deep, dipping cross, but can&apos;t quite get his toe to the ball to poke home from two yards. MEMO TO ENGLAND: &quot;Take note,&quot; writes Rob Edwards. &quot;THIS is how you screw up a Euro campaign. None of this being rubbish all the time business. Pretend you&apos;re good, fluke a few results against top-quality opposition, then completely collapse in style towards the end. This is how it&apos;s done. Excellent work, Scotland, truly outstanding.&quot; The self-hate starts now, doesn&apos;t it? We always knew it would happen sooner rather than later. 81 min: SCOTLAND HAVE ANOTHER SHOT ON TARGET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It&apos;s McFadden on the turn in the box; the ball reaches speeds of up to 13 centimetres/hour before rolling into Youngkeeper&apos;s hands. 83 min: At least there&apos;s no unbearable tension, look at it that way. 86 min: &quot;Which Ronnie Haslehurst theme best sums this Scotland performance up?&quot; asks Mike Shallcross, who in his role as deputy editor of Men&apos;s Health magazine should probably be cutting to length a piece about buffing your guns, instead of emailing national newspaper websites about sitcom themes. Anyway, Mike, it&apos;s a toss-up between the soporific Rise and Fall of Reggie Perrin, or the poignant Last of the Summer Wine, I&apos;d say. I almost suggested Blankety Blank, but then this has been far from a supermatch game. McHedlidze is replaced by, er, I&apos;m not going to try to wing it, I missed that one. There&apos;s a lesson to learn about priorities here, isn&apos;t there. 88 min: This game is over, and Klaus Toppmoller is killing time with substitutions: Jakobia comes on for Siradze. 89 min: From a late corner, Beattie takes a wild slash at the ball. The ball just about stays in the stadium. There are going to be five minutes of added time, but don&apos;t get your hopes up, no way are Scotland going to score one, never mind two. 90 + 2 min: The ball drops to McFadden just outside the box but, just as he shapes to volley, Fletcher crosses in front of him and the half-chance is gone. &quot;I think this is the best possible result,&quot; writes Anita Buchan. &quot;If we had won, we would only need a draw against Italy, and would therefore probably lose. This way, we just need to win and will therefore have more motivation. And France could still drop points against Lithuania, and they&apos;ll find going to Ukraine in November very difficult.&quot; 90 + 4 min: Asatiani is booked for some needless timewasting. Dan Barron blames this result on the maroon jerseys, while Greg Phillips nominates the theme to Ronnie Corbett vehicle Sorry as the perfect Hazlehurst soundtrack for this shambles. Full-time: Georgia 2 - 0 Scotland. And that&apos;s it. &quot;Well, that&apos;s it then,&quot; sighs Paul Milton. &quot;We&apos;ll just have to beat the world champions at Hampden. Easy!&quot; Scotland were terrible tonight against a team containing more than their fair share of novices - quite a few of the team&apos;s big names went missing - but then the loss to injury of the world-class (yep) Scott Brown was a huge blow. If they can name their first-choice XI next month... well, stranger things have happened, just ask the French.

Every week seems to bring a new management book on the topic, and everywhere, from France to Dubai to Singapore, is busy trying to create the next Silicon Valley. The funny thing is that most of these efforts are pointless - or worse. That is because, as this week&apos;s Economist notes, the most powerful thing that corporate bosses and government leaders can do to spur innovation in their companies and countries is to give people freedom: freedom to move, freedom to think, freedom to create. Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, observes that innovation in the past was dominated by elites - the &quot;wealthy gentlemen tinkerers&quot;, for example - who had privileged access to information, money and markets. He believes his firm&apos;s success owes a tremendous amount to the radically different, bottom-up culture he encountered in California: &quot;we were tremendously lucky to be at Stanford and in Silicon Valley.&quot; He is right that the history of innovation is one dominated by centralised processes and elites in ivory towers, but look closer and you find that the ordinary punter has silently played an important role. In his book A Culture of Improvement: Technology and the Western Millennium, a fine history of the topic, Robert Friedel shows in convincing detail how countless small efforts by individual bright sparks, be they low or high on society&apos;s ladder, to improve life have actually contributed to the astonishing advances that we enjoy in today&apos;s postmodern, post-industrial societies. Imagine how much better firms and countries could innovate if they actively harnessed the distributed creative potential of all those innovators-in-waiting rather than turning up their noses at them. The key, Mr Friedel observes, is freedom: &quot;Technology and the pursuit of improvement are ultimate expressions of freedom, of the capacity of humans to reject the limitations of their past and their experience, to transcend the boundaries of their biological capacities and their social traditions.&quot; To put the argument the other way round, domineering bosses and authoritarian governments may succeed for a while, and may even notch up some successes along the way. But eventually, history shows that all empresarios - be that Steve Jobs, the currently high-flying boss of Apple, or Lee Kuan Yew, the man who built modern Singapore - stagnate. Some die or are forced out, some lose the magic touch, and some, like Fidel Castro, simply hang around too long after the revolution. Tim Brown, the head of Ideo, a global design consultancy, has observed the enthusiastic efforts in Dubai, China, Singapore and elsewhere impose such top-down innovation, and he remains sceptical. &quot;You can ordain the money but not the brilliance and free-thinking,&quot; he insists. &quot;Creative people like to challenge constraints and authority - and very scared people are not very innovative.&quot; That sort of assessment mightily irritates those who argue that benevolent bureaucrats can indeed steer a society toward innovation. Kishore Mabhuhbhani, the head of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore and the country&apos;s former UN ambassador, rejects criticism of his government&apos;s approach as western arrogance and naivete. In a forthcoming book, he sets out his arguments for why Asia&apos;s rise is unstoppable, and why Singaporeans and mainland Chinese entrepreneurs and innovators are not at all bothered about the political freedom that so obsesses western commentators: &quot;businessmen are very practical, and they know the alternative political system here is chaos - so they are perfectly comfortable being free and innovative in business while accepting the reality of the political situation.&quot; This argument for state-directed capitalism was always shaky, though it must be admitted there have been times during the past few decades when its proponents could point to success stories. The east Asian success with manufacturing-oriented, export-led growth was the poster child for the &quot;Asian Way&quot;, but the fragility of that model of growth was exposed by the southeast Asian financial crisis. However, the times are changing fast, as this special report has demonstrated. Low-end manufacturing is yielding rapidly to knowledge-based industries, a transformation that is being accelerated by the twin forces of globalisation and Googlisation. In today&apos;s knowledge economy, innovation is the new currency of global competition. And as firms move toward open innovation models to stay a step ahead of disruptive innovators, so too must governments that want to keep their economies competitive in the fiercely competitive global economy. As William Weldon, chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson, a healthcare giant, observes, &quot;Innovation is no longer about money, it&apos;s about the climate: are individuals allowed to flourish and take risks?&quot; Stuart Brand, an internet pioneer, has famously argued that &quot;information wants to be free.&quot; Then surely the knowledge worker, the creator of that information, also yearns for that same freedom? Those companies and governments that liberate the innovator inside every one of us will find that their economies will roar and the spirits of their people will soar. And best of all, they will benefit the whole world as they do so because innovation is not a zero-sum game. The rising tide of inventions that make one country wealthy benefit many others that bring those clever ideas to market or simply make use of those products, processes or services. In this new age of mass innovation, the world may even find profitable ways to deliver the 21st century&apos;s greatest needs, including affordable universal healthcare and sustainable clean energy, creating entirely new industries in the process. After all, the world will then at last be harnessing the one natural resource that the world has left in infinite quantity: human ingenuity.

The plane is, by almost all accounts, a success - the reviews of its luxury classes and high-tech amenities are glowing; even better, compared with its nearest competitor, the Boeing 747-400, its cost-per-seat is 20% less. &quot;This is a major milestone for the A380 program,&quot; said Airbus CEO Thomas Enders, standing in front of the double-decker giant. He&apos;s right, in more ways than one. What&apos;s more impressive than Airbus&apos; construction of the world&apos;s largest passenger plane is the fact that the company came through at all. After years spent planning and designing, the company still had to postpone the plane several times, ultimately putting it two years behind schedule, $6.8bn over budget, and on its fifth CEO since the development began. For some, this will come as a vindication that the Airbus model - a state-supported firm created to unify the major European aerospace industries - actually works, particularly given last week&apos;s news that Airbus&apos; main competitor, Boeing, is facing a six-month delay on its next-generation Dreamliner. But look closer, and the picture isn&apos;t so clear. Ultimately, in order for Airbus to deliver the A380, it essentially had to stop acting like Airbus - and start acting like a real company. Airbus was formed in 1970 by a coalition of British, French and German companies, but has received substantial state subsidies, and it was always understood that its operations would be coordinated with the three governments&apos; political interests; thus plants and management were spread over the three countries (though last year Britain&apos;s BAE sold its interest to Airbus&apos; parent company, EADS). Since the company is first and foremost a political experiment, it shouldn&apos;t be surprising that the joint Franco-German leadership was in constant struggle, and to reduce tension had created redundancies and operational divisions that may have made sense to a diplomat, but not a manager. The biggest problem during the manufacturing phases of the A380 development, it soon became apparent, was the incompatibilities between plants in Germany and France. The most obvious was the existence of a dual management structure at both Airbus and EADS: Each major executive post had both a German and a French occupant, who, not surprisingly, often took their own country&apos;s side in what should have been purely management debates. Or take communications between plants in France, Germany and Spain. Even on matters that required careful coordination, like wiring blueprints, the independent cultures and management structures that existed within each country, and even each plant, made cooperation difficult. German and French engineers even used different software. For a plane like the A380, which has some 300 miles of cables, this was a big problem. As the Airbus plant in Hamburg worked on the external body of the plane, the Toulouse plant worked on the internal. Along the way, changes at one plant were late or incompletely communicated to the other, leading to lengthy delays. It wasn&apos;t until major changes were made to depoliticize the company that real progress began. Earlier this year the dual-management structure was replaced with a more streamlined hierarchy; Enders, who had been a CEO at EADS, even took a technical demotion to Airbus. The firm also announced that it would streamline its operations, including the elimination of several thousand jobs - a move previously thought impossible, given the political influence of French and German unions. Meanwhile, on the shop floor, middle managers cut through the redundant and inefficient manufacturing and design processes. They forced engineers to use the same software, with 80 Germans even moving to Toulouse to train on it. And they required daily management meetings and constant communication with their international counterparts. Delayed and overstretched, they ultimately delivered. &quot;Integration is the key word,&quot; Enders said. &quot;We found out we were not integrated enough for the huge challenge of building a complex aircraft.&quot; The lesson, then, is not that Europe shouldn&apos;t pursue corporate integration; in fact, it&apos;s quite the opposite. The problems embodied in the A380&apos;s manufacturing derived not only from Airbus&apos; status as a political creation playing in a business world. More fundamentally, the issue was that an experiment in integration was not sufficiently integrated. It&apos;s not that Airbus was too international - the problem was that Airbus&apos; politics prevented it from being international enough."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/18/1", "sentences": ["The Financial Times has apologised and paid libel damages and costs to Singapore&apos;s prime minister and the country&apos;s founding father after accusing them of nepotism.", "This week&apos;s apology was to Singapore&apos;s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong and his father, the former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, now called the minister mentor.", "&quot;We undertake not to make any further allegations to the same or similar effect.&quot; Mr Lee Jr became prime minister in 2004, following in the footsteps of his father Mr Lee Sr, who was Singapore&apos;s first prime minister after independence from Malaysia in 1965 and led the country for 25 years."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-18T13:49:52Z", "title": "Financial Times apologises to Singapore PM over nepotism claims", "tags": ["Media", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The Financial Times has apologised and paid libel damages and costs to Singapore&apos;s prime minister and the country&apos;s founding father after accusing them of nepotism.

So far, hundreds of pairs of pants have been posted, according to another campaigner, Liz Hilton. &quot;One group sent 140 pairs to the Burmese embassy in Geneva,&quot; she said. The campaign was a serious attempt to allow ordinary women to express their outrage at the regime&apos;s response to democracy demonstrations led by Buddhist monks, Ms Pollack said. &quot;Condemnation by the United Nations and governments around the world have had no impact on the Burmese regime. This is a way of trying to reach them where they will feel it,&quot; she said. &quot;The junta is famous for its abuse of women: it is well documented that they use rape as a weapon of war against ethnic minorities.

Was it on the night of August 15 1947, when India and Pakistan gained independence, and devastated Britons felt (as Enoch Powell later remembered) as if their world was &quot;coming apart&quot;? Was it in the autumn of 1956, when Britain invaded Suez only to withdraw its forces in humiliation within a week? Was it in April 1980, when Margaret Thatcher teared up in front of a television set in Westminster, watching the transfer of power in Rhodesia? Or in June 1997, when Chris Patten wept on camera as the union flag came down in Hong Kong? Rather like a chap found dead in a club chair, nobody seems able to say quite when the British empire expired, but everyone agrees it is no more. Even while the empire expanded, some were forecasting its decline. A 1774 issue of Lloyd&apos;s Evening Post published a futuristic fantasy set in 1974, describing a tour by two men from &quot;the empire of America&quot; through the ruins of London. No less unwittingly prescient was Edward Gibbon, the first volume of whose Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire rolled off the presses early in 1776. His sales could only have been helped when the American Declaration of Independence was signed a few months later. Pudding-faced Gibbon, &quot;with his chubby cheeks ... and his weakness for puce-coloured velvet suits and orange zig-zag dimity waistcoats&quot;, provides a touchstone for Piers Brendon throughout his sumptuous chronicle of the British empire. The spectre of decline and fall, he suggests, haunted empire-building from Gibbon&apos;s age onwards. Where most accounts of British imperial collapse concentrate on the 20th century, Brendon begins his story on the battlefield of Yorktown, in 1781. It was there that Britain suffered its first major anti-colonial defeat, when Lord Cornwallis surrendered to George Washington, effectively conceding American independence. Rather than portraying Yorktown and subsequent setbacks as anomalies in an arc of imperial ascent, Brendon uses this novel point of entry to reinterpret the British empire as an enterprise whose validity was persistently challenged, from within and without. What follows is a compelling and spectacularly detailed retelling of imperial &quot;rise&quot; as well as fall, from Yorktown to Hong Kong. Not since Jan Morris&apos;s Pax Britannica trilogy has anyone recounted these events with such sustained panache. Brendon&apos;s empire is a ramshackle affair, managed for decades out of a Colonial Office that boasted &quot;an assortment of rickety chairs and old, baize-covered tables,&quot; a basement &quot;so damp that it had to be pumped out twice a day&quot; and an attic that doubled as a fives court. Virtually every page offers up some memorable observation. Brendon gleefully traces the career of that characteristic imperial accessory, the moustache. British cultivation of the hairy upper lip was inspired, he suggests, by Indian ideals of virility, and would decline in proportion with the empire&apos;s reach: Harold Macmillan was &quot;the last British prime minister to sport a moustache&quot;. The book also doubles as an extended meditation on Britain&apos;s fraught love affair with ancient Rome. Brendon peppers his pages with contemporary allusions to the Roman empire, and they were legion. British rulers were steeped in the classics, from Richard Wellesley, who filled Calcutta&apos;s Government House with &quot;the busts of a dozen Caesars&quot;, to George Nathaniel Curzon 100 years later, who &quot;lisped in Gibbon&quot;. Such training meant that even as they gilded and gloried in their empire, Britons always worried about intrinsic tendencies towards decline. Necessarily, blood flows freely through this book. At Cawnpore in 1857, where nearly 200 British women and children had been notoriously slaughtered by the Indian mutineers, the British forced suspected perpetrators to &quot;lick blood from the slaughter-house floor before they were hanged&quot;. At Isandhlwana in 1879, British soldiers were shredded by Zulu iklwas blades, &quot;so named in imitation of the sucking sound they made when pulled from human flesh&quot;. But it was mass slaughter, 20th century-style, that would truly bring the empire down. During the Boer war 160,000 white civilians would be rounded up into ghastly concentration camps - creating a precedent explicitly cited by the Nazis. The first world war carried Canadians and Indians to &quot;the bone-chilling, gut-wrenching, soul-destroying shambles of the western front&quot;, and Australians and New Zealanders to the hell of Gallipoli, where relentless firing turned &quot;their trenches into cemeteries&quot;. With the end of the first world war, even as Britain acquired new protectorates, the imperial patchwork was undeniably coming apart at the seams. It was as if, in Beatrice Webb&apos;s words, the empire began to suffer from &quot;a sort of senile hypertrophy&quot;, reaching new heights of brutality with the Amritsar massacre of 1919 and new peaks of decadence in expat enclaves from Kenya to Shanghai. The second world war accelerated the crash. On hearing the Japanese bombing of the causeway that linked Singapore to the mainland, the headmaster of Raffles School asked what all the noise was. &quot;That,&quot; replied Lee Kwan Yew, Singapore&apos;s future prime minister, &quot;is the end of the British empire.&quot; He was not far wrong. As Brendon shows, the chaos of war made it virtually impossible for Britain to retain India and Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon, all of which gained independence by 1948. &quot;To save the empire&quot;, Labour ministers observed, required &quot;giving the colonies self-government&quot;. In Malaya Britain did try to hold on, only to face insurgent attacks. It responded by declaring a state of emergency and pursuing a bitter campaign against Chinese &quot;communist terrorists&quot;. This would gain cruel resonance in Kenya, where the imposition of a state of emergency in 1952 provoked intensified insurgency and the British rounding-up of tens of thousands of Mau Mau suspects into horrific detention camps. In central Africa, too, decolonisation was born in violence: worst of all in Rhodesia, where savage conflict erupted between the black majority and the fiercely racist white leadership which had unilaterally declared independence in 1965. Set against such blood-stained operations, Britain&apos;s most recent imperial war - in the Falklands - appears relatively tame. (Though sadly the West Indies, once Britain&apos;s most valuable colonial territories, rate little more space in this book than those desolate isles.) Brendon conducts his comprehensive tour of empire&apos;s fall with characteristic flair, but what depressing sights it offers. All told, The Decline and Fall of the British Empire presents a glittering panoply of decadence, folly, farce and devastation. Brendon&apos;s characters alone could fill a pantomime stage many times over. The empire seemed to abound in British oddballs, from the notorious Richard Burton, who &quot;liked to boast that he had indulged in every vice and indulged in every crime&quot;, to the maverick General Orde Wingate, who &quot;would ... hold interviews while lying naked on a bed and combing his body hair with a toothbrush&quot;. Postcolonial heroes fare little better. Jomo Kenyatta &quot;sported plus-fours, drank literally inflammatory Nubian gin and so indulged his sexual appetites that he was suspended from church membership&quot;, while Tunku Abdul Rahman of Malaysia was &quot;notorious for dancing, horse-racing, driving fast cars and getting into tight corners with loose women&quot;. Kwame Nkrumah &quot;studied the occult, consulted oracles&quot; and &quot;compared himself to Christ&quot;. Mahatma Gandhi becomes &quot;a compound of oriental mystic and occidental crank, humble sadhu and astute advocate&quot;. These titbits make for amusing reading, but they also make it hard to take any of these figures seriously - and, by extension, to understand the wellsprings of their popularity or power. What exactly is the point in telling us that Gandhi &quot;means &apos;grocer&apos; in his native Gujarati&quot;? Gibbon means a kind of ape. This touches on the chief casualty of Brendon&apos;s descriptive approach: the relative absence of explanation and analysis. After so much rich narrative, one is left craving synthesis - particularly comparison across regions, for such interconnections help make an empire what it is. How, for example, did the use of partition in Ireland in 1921 influence its subsequent application in Palestine and south Asia? How might British counter-insurgency tactics developed in one domain - South Africa or Ireland, Palestine or Malaya - have been replayed in others? (To say nothing of their influence on the Americans in Vietnam, or the French in Algeria.) To what extent did imperial personnel carry policies from region to region? What kinds of networks of influence existed among anti-colonial leaders, such as the black nationalists inspired by Gandhi, or advocates of non-alignment? Brendon nods in these directions, but readers looking for deep answers will want to turn elsewhere. &quot;I wonder if the Romans ever went back to visit Britain,&quot; mused Jawaharlal Nehru when he received a visit from Macmillan in India in 1958. At all events, the Romans, like the British, revisited their empire through the medium of history-writing - and Brendon has produced remarkable testament to how seductive such excursions can be. The real wonder, after reading his book, is how Britain ever managed to have an empire at all. \u00b7 Maya Jasanoff&apos;s Edge of Empire: Conquest and Collecting in the East 1750-1850 is published by HarperPerennial"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/oct/21/uknews.theobserver", "sentences": ["At a few minutes after eight on Thursday morning, aviation history will be made at Singapore&apos;s Changi International Airport.", "If - and of course, this remains to be seen - this new larger plane means you could keep the number of flights the same, or even bring them down, then it would be a good thing.&apos; Thursday&apos;s initial Singapore Airlines A380 flight will be an all-for-charity affair.", "Next Sunday, the plane will go into regular service between Singapore and Sydney, at a cool \u00a33,500 one way for one of its double-bed suites.", "Early next year, as more of the long-delayed A380s trickle into service, Singapore Airlines will begin a daily service to Heathrow.", "The Singapore Airlines version has about 400 economy seats, 60 super-wide business-class places and 12 &apos;first class-plus&apos; suites with sliding doors, work tables and flat-screen TVs.", "But I watched as the first A380 was handed over for the flight to Singapore and I couldn&apos;t help thinking that it is simply an amazing aircraft.&apos;"], "publicationDate": "2007-10-21T08:48:16Z", "title": "Airbus double-deck superjumbo takes a bold leap into the future", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Travel", "UK news", "EADS", "Airbus"], "article": "At a few minutes after eight on Thursday morning, aviation history will be made at Singapore&apos;s Changi International Airport. The world&apos;s largest, most luxurious passenger airliner - with a wingspan nearly the size of a football pitch and first-class &apos;suites&apos; complete with double beds - will lift off for its maiden flight to Sydney. The debut of the A380 &apos;Superjumbo&apos;, nearly two years behind schedule and billions of pounds over budget, is the culmination of an audacious gamble by its creators, the European consortium Airbus, on the future of world air travel. Essentially, Airbus is betting that more and more people will be travelling longer and longer distances, between continental &apos;hubs&apos; such as London and New York, Sydney and Beijing. Both economically and environmentally, they hope, airlines will find the double-decker A380 the most efficient way of meeting ever-rising numbers of ever more demanding passengers. It is a vision that has yet to be tested against the harsh realities of modern air travel. Airbus has found itself, for instance, having to reassure sceptics about the potential effects of its new superjet on congestion at already crowded airports. With wider aisles, the company argues, the process of getting on and off should be quicker than on smaller, older planes. But the new plane has won some unlikely allies, such as Airport Watch, which has been leading a campaign against &apos;aggressive go-for-growth&apos; aviation policy in Britain. Its chairman, John Stewart, who has been helping residents fight against the expansion of Heathrow, said last night that &apos;at least in theory, the A380 could be a win-win. &apos;The main benefits in air travel are for the passengers, but the problems are the planes. If - and of course, this remains to be seen - this new larger plane means you could keep the number of flights the same, or even bring them down, then it would be a good thing.&apos; Thursday&apos;s initial Singapore Airlines A380 flight will be an all-for-charity affair. The first pair of first-class tickets sold on eBay went to an Australian with a deep sense of history and even deeper pockets - for \u00a350,000. Next Sunday, the plane will go into regular service between Singapore and Sydney, at a cool \u00a33,500 one way for one of its double-bed suites. Early next year, as more of the long-delayed A380s trickle into service, Singapore Airlines will begin a daily service to Heathrow. Next will be Emirates Airlines, which will get is first A380s next summer. Both British Airways and Virgin are due to take delivery of the plane around the time of the 2012 Olympics. The last similarly bold leap in commercial aircraft design was in 1970 when Boeing launched its 747. The Jumbo has gone on to become one of the most successful passenger jets ever, with its latest version due to enter service in 2009. Its staying power has put pressure on Airbus, which bet its financial future on the A380. It is, by any measure, an extraordinary plane. Unlike the 747, with its two-tier seating at the front of the plane, Airbus&apos;s Superjumbo is a full double-decker - big enough to accommodate more than 800 seats if the entire plane were turned over to economy class. It is nearly 25 metres tall, 73m long and 80m from wing-tip to wing-tip. Snaking within are 300 miles of wires. Perhaps the best way to get a true sense of the A380&apos;s vastness is to visit the small north Wales town of Broughton, where Airbus UK has been assembling the wings. Inside a cavernous purpose-built factory, the wings, each pair held together by 750,000 rivets, take shape. As a finished wing is readied for shipment to the assembly plant in Toulouse, one of the blue-shirted engineers says he still wonders at the scale of it all. &apos;The wing flaps,&apos; he says, &apos;are the size of the entire wing of a short-haul passenger jet.&apos; There was a time earlier this year, however, when Broughton feared it was making wings for a Superjumbo that would never fly. In a quintessentially European snag, wiring and other problems in the plane&apos;s fuselage - half built by the French, half by the Germans - led to a series of delays in deliveries that had initially been set for last year. Broughton&apos;s staff of 1,200 A380 workers was repeatedly scaled back, with hundreds reassigned to other Airbus types. At one point a skeleton crew of barely 100 was all that remained. Some customers, such as Virgin, pushed back orders. Others, like parcels giant Fedex, which had wanted 10 A380 freight versions, cancelled altogether and opted for Boeing. John Gillbanks, a former teenage apprentice who has risen up the ranks and now runs the A380 wing factory, said that with the plane finally ready to fly he was building up to a full production staff again. &apos;But,&apos; he said, smiling, &apos;we almost lost our shirt.&apos; Demand has rebounded - there are now more than 165 firm orders, with Virgin and BA the latest to come back aboard. Still, industry analysts estimate that, with the loss in revenue and cost overruns due to the repeated delays, Airbus will have to sell an additional 350 or so to break even. But the hope and expectation at Broughton last week was that, as with the old Boeing 747, the mere passenger impact of the new Superjumbo will make demand contagious. When the project was launched, there was talk of everything from pool tables to fully fledged shopping areas, first-class showers and on-board casinos. The problem is that the economic and environmental claims for the A380 - whose per-passenger emission levels have been calculated to be the equivalent of an ordinary car - all hinge on devoting most of the space to economy-class passengers. The Singapore Airlines version has about 400 economy seats, 60 super-wide business-class places and 12 &apos;first class-plus&apos; suites with sliding doors, work tables and flat-screen TVs. Luxury in the air, but potential trouble for the economic and ecological bottom line. Still, Gillbanks caught the mood inside Airbus and beyond last week when he said such issues would be worked out as more airlines took delivery of the planes. &apos;I&apos;ve worked on all sorts and sizes of planes,&apos; he said. &apos;And when you are close to these things, you sometimes forget the big picture. But I watched as the first A380 was handed over for the flight to Singapore and I couldn&apos;t help thinking that it is simply an amazing aircraft.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/21/peoplepowercanwin", "sentences": ["The Asean regional bloc of which Burma is a member has responded with condemnation and &quot;revulsion&quot;, and Singapore - where the generals get their Armani, hospital care and private banking - has refused to rule out sanctions."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-21T15:00:00Z", "title": "People power can win", "tags": ["World news", "Religion", "Politics", "China", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "For now the images of monks and protesters massing on the streets of Rangoon and other cities, and of the military junta&apos;s brutal crackdown, may have vanished from our television screens. But the so-called &quot;saffron revolution&quot; is far from over. The world must not turn away. In Burma, thousands of the monks and protesters who captured our hearts with their bravery are being brutally tortured in prison. At the same time we hear that the democracy movement is regrouping, its base broader than before. Around the world, the last three weeks have seen an unprecedented mobilisation in solidarity with the protesters. We at Avaaz.org have organised a 780,000-strong global petition, which was delivered on Monday to British prime minister, Gordon Brown, with a group of Burmese monks and exiles, and in a full-page Financial Times advertisement, addressed China. A coalition of groups, from Avaaz.org and Amnesty International to the International Trade Union Confederation and Facebook, organised big demonstrations in 200 cities worldwide on Saturday October 6 - and much more is planned. As UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari gathers support from Burma&apos;s neighbours, a fresh wave of global pressure is targeting key governments, many of whom are slowly starting to turn the screws on the junta. The coming days and weeks are crucial. The generals and their allies claim that things are back to &quot;business as usual&quot; in Burma. The media, shamefully, has followed their lead. Much has been said about the crackdown in 1988, in which over 3,000 protesters were massacred. But it is worth remembering the story of the Burmese people&apos;s courage then, because it can give the world an object lesson in staying power. In March 1988, the death of a student provoked angry demonstrations and hundreds of students were killed. But in June and July 1988, the students came back with more mass protests. Again blood flowed in the streets. The government began to bend. Two general strikes were called in August, bringing workers and the whole country into the struggle. Amidst more massacres, more than half a million people joined in daily demonstrations in Rangoon. The government lifted martial law and released some prisoners. It took six months. By September, the democracy movement had control of at least 50 cities and towns, and air force troops joined the marchers on the streets. The ruling party finally called for multi-party elections. It was at that moment that the current junta launched its brutal coup, shooting hundreds and arresting thousands more. Even then, the struggle was not over. The junta also promised elections. The National League for Democracy was formed, and Aung San Suu Kyi toured the country. She attracted crowds of tens of thousands, defying the ban on public assemblies. Instead of marching, now they were listening and asking questions. In 1990, two years after the first massacre, Suu Kyi&apos;s party won over 80% of the vote. But the junta refused to recognise the result and placed her and other leaders under house arrest - and the world let them do it. Will the Burmese give up now, three weeks into their first revival in 19 years? Remembering the tragedy of 1988 and 1990, Burmese journalist May Ng wrote in Mizzima, &quot;there is a powerful difference this time. The world&apos;s reaction to Burma is impressive ... The people of Burma will not be alone this time.&quot; Will we betray that trust? The global response is sluggish, but gathering pace. China has agreed to the first UN security council presidential statement ever on Burma, and put its name to a call for the release of all political prisoners. The European Union just voted for the first package of sanctions and incentives which will genuinely squeeze the Burmese generals. The Asean regional bloc of which Burma is a member has responded with condemnation and &quot;revulsion&quot;, and Singapore - where the generals get their Armani, hospital care and private banking - has refused to rule out sanctions. It should be becoming clear by now to China and Burma&apos;s other sponsors that the only hope of stability lies in a genuine transition. Than Shwe&apos;s regime is politically bankrupt. The Burmese analyst Thant Myint-U is right: there is no Velvet Revolution possible in Burma, and the army&apos;s institutions must play a full part in the transition. But without a tripartite dialogue which acknowledges the legitimate demands of the democratic opposition and the ethnic groups, and which leads to a new and more democratic order, Burma faces an abyss. It is time for all parties to do their utmost to bring about that transition - ideally, under the wing of Ban Ki-Moon and the core group of nations being constituted to support UN-led diplomacy. But people are being tortured right now, and diplomacy can go in sterile and hypocritical circles unless pressed into action. We know what we need to do. Avaaz.org&apos;s campaign continues to grow - most recently, we have sent tens of thousands of messages to EU and South-East Asian leaders from their electorates, and are raising sorely-needed funds for the Burmese movement. The images and stories will flow again. The people will hold the streets. On October 24, the 12th anniversary of Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s incarceration, global activists will converge to make our demands heard again.

So he would have been flabbergasted to see his prophecy realised, not by communism, but by the globalisation of Anglo-American economic liberalism. Opening up markets to the free flow of capital, not the dictatorship of the proletariat, has rendered state power obsolete. Today&apos;s capital markets raise money for governments, corporate clients, and individual customers, manage pension funds&apos; investments, and bet on the level of interest rates or the stock market. Trading in derivatives by investment banks, hedge funds, and other market participants, reaps huge profits for traders while depriving the real economy of productive investment and job creation. No population in the world is spared from the harsh treatment of such a system. Some 40% of the world&apos;s 6.5 billion people live in poverty, and a sixth live in extreme poverty. However, the world&apos;s black populations are the prime victims. In the United States, one-eighth of all black males between the ages of 25 and 34 are in jail, and three out of five black American households with children are headed by a single mother. As for African countries, the politics and economics of globalisation have stripped them of their assets and natural resources and left them with an unbearable debt burden. As a result, the percentage of Africa&apos;s population living in extreme poverty increased from 41.6% in 1981 to 46.9% in 2001. On the other hand, in the era of globalisation, regions in which internal trade exceeds external trade have better economic outlooks and stronger social cohesion. This is the case for Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, particularly among the member states of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay). The opposite is true for regional groupings in Africa and in the Middle East where trade with the outside world is more important than intra-regional trade. As a result, any country formulating strategies to counter the destructive forces of globalisation should give overriding priority to a self-centred economic development strategy, preferably within a regional framework. This is a prerequisite to defending against market fundamentalism and avoiding the iniquitous conditions of the international marketplace. In this respect, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) constitutes an edifying example. The ASEAN economies adopted a united front on international economic issues and accorded priority to internal economic integration and expanding linkages with major trading partners. Exports have remained the main driver of economic performance for the Asean countries, contributing to 5.8% regional GDP growth in 2006. Asean foreign direct investment (FDI) flows reached $38bn in 2005, up by 48% from the previous year. The outlook for 2006 was also bullish, with preliminary data for the first quarter indicating that FDI flows had already reached $14bn, up from $7.4bn in the year-earlier period. Asean&apos;s drive to establish a fully-fledged economic community has been underlined by implementation of its Priority Integration Sector Roadmaps. By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s historical legacy of artificial and unmanageable colonial boundaries, ethnic antagonisms, its citizens&apos; deficit of self-respect, and an appalling record of leadership failures has hampered its quest for economic integration. But a sector-by-sector approach could mitigate these handicaps, and, given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change, it might be strategically advisable to start with the energy sector. Africa is a continent rich in energy, holding two-thirds of the world&apos;s reserves of hydroelectric power - trillions of kilowatt-hours representing about half of total world resources. The Congo River alone holds more than 600 billion kilowatt-hours of annual reserves. The Sanaga (Cameroon) and the Ogoou\u00e9 (Gabon) hold half as much. Technological breakthroughs have made it feasible to transport electricity via high-voltage direct current (HVDC) over long distances without incurring great losses (only about 3% per 1,000km). Carbon-free hydroelectric power is the right choice as sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s principal source of energy. Harnessing the hydroelectric power of the Congo Basin alone would be enough to meet all of Africa&apos;s energy needs, or to light the entire continent of South America. Moreover, establishing an African grid would enable power from the Democratic Republic of Congo to be delivered to southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy. However, while 90% of world reserves of hydraulic energy are concentrated in underdeveloped regions like sub-Saharan Africa, HVDC technology remains the preserve of developed countries. There is thus an imperative not only for regional integration in Africa, but also for a joint strategic vision and partnership to help build global energy and climate security.

Instead of punishing his persecutors, last Thursday UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon suspended Toh for two months without pay and demoted him. This is like fining a witch at the stake for fire-raising, or as the indignant Singapore foreign ministry colourfully put it: &quot;Toh is like a pedestrian deliberately hit by a speeding car as he crosses the street, only to be cited for jaywalking as he lies injured, while the culprit goes unpunished&quot;. Almost two years ago, under pressure from the US, the UN sent more staff to help the OIOS investigate the UN&apos;s procurement office. The new procurement task force began in January 2006, with its head a former assistant district attorney from Connecticut, and its first official act was to put Toh on leave while they investigated. Toh was been ground down in a Kafkaesque process ever since. When they could not find any evidence to back their original corruption charges against him, they expanded their investigation and demanded that he submit details of all transactions in his family exceeding US$10,000, as well as any gifts received exceeding US$250, for the previous decade. The UN&apos;s joint disciplinary committee has now cleared Toh of fraud, but obviously leery of being accused of wasting the UN&apos;s resources, reprimanded him for negligence in filing his financial disclosures. This should be no surprise to anyone who has watched the OIOS at work. For years, American politicians and media wanting to score quick political points have raised allegations of &quot;waste, mismanagement and corruption&quot; at the UN. Instead of rebutting false charges, successive secretary generals have pandered to them, throwing accused staff to the wolves. Any UN staff member who comes under investigation, particularly from an American accusation, is presumed guilty, even if like Toh he is proven innocent. During the Iraq &quot;oil for food&quot; storm, the Volcker commission&apos;s release of OIOS&apos;s internal reports fed the media frenzy, helped along by malicious leaks from investigators. Half-digested, with no notice taken of any rebuttals from the &quot;accused,&quot; a typically memorable charge was that the UN&apos;s border inspectors had wasted money by being on station at the Iraqi border months before the food and oil trade was up and running. But, as an exasperated staff member pointed out, that was because the UN security council had ordered them to be there. And if they were not, doubtless, he suggested, there would have been a nitpicking OIOS report complaining about their failure to comply with the council&apos;s instructions. In 2001 I wrote a story about a company using the planes that it was contracting to the UN to smuggle &quot;blood diamonds&quot; from central Africa. I approached OIOS for comment. They did not return my calls, but internal sources told me its response was not to investigate the company, but to investigate who had leaked me the story. Even professionals inside its ranks have quit and tried to blow the whistle on the OIOS&apos;s methods. The UN needs an adequate justice system that exonerates the innocent, punishes the guilty and dissolves the OIOS and its procurement task force, the acting head of which - despite being guilty of this wasteful and malicious vendetta against Toh - is confidently expecting to be promoted next year. The Wall St Journal is already campaigning to retain the task force in the face of Singapore&apos;s objections. The UN panel on Toh&apos;s claims recommended that OIOS and the UN should review their rules on investigations and &quot;bring them in line with the judgements of the United Nations administrative tribunal and the existing international instruments on human rights&quot;. That is long overdue. The impunity that used to be enjoyed by perpetrators in the UN has been replaced with a lack of accountability and a total impunity by the OIOS, whose malicious incompetence is aimed more at glory in the Murdoch press than at justice. Since the UN has been quick to remove the diplomatic immunity of any staff member suspected of criminal behaviour, not least anyone fingered by the Fox-hunters of the far right, Toh wants reciprocation. He wants the secretary general to lift the immunity of his persecutors so he can sue his persecutors for the egregious abuses of natural justice and established procedure which the UN&apos;s own courts have found. By the time the UN appeals procedure rules that Toh&apos;s suspension and demotion were wrong, and awards him substantial compensation, his persecutors will be safely drawing a substantial salary. Ban Ki Moon has made the promotion of human rights a priority of his administration. He should begin inside his own organization by ignoring US pressure and putting a stop to the persecution of Toh."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/23/international.mainsection3", "sentences": ["Copperfield was scheduled to tour Indonesia Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-23T22:59:51Z", "title": "International news in brief", "tags": ["World news"], "article": "Copperfield cancels Asia dates after sex allegations American magician David Copperfield has cancelled shows in south-east Asia following allegations of sexual misconduct in the US, a Thai organiser said yesterday.

The alleged gunman was critically wounded in the incident in the barracks at the US base, said the official. He apparently shot himself during the incident, which was limited to the three sailors and was not terror related, the navy reported in a statement.

BREAKTHROUGH IN FERTILITY TREATMENT It&apos;s not quite the seven ages of man, but there is certainly a preoccupation with the exits and entrances of men and women in the papers this morning. First, the mewling and puking, and the Independent splashes with a photo of twin babies, the first to be conceived in the UK as the result of a pioneering fertility treatment. &quot;A cheap, painless alternative to IVF?&quot; asks the paper. In Vitro Maturation, the new technique used to make the babies, dispenses with the use of costly fertility drugs, saving up to \u00a31,500 on the normal price of treatment. It is also safer for the one in three women among those seeking fertility treatment who have polycystic ovaries. The babies were conceived using eggs that were removed from their mother&apos;s ovaries while still undeveloped and then matured artificially in the laboratory before being fertilised with their father&apos;s sperm. Meanwhile, the Times features a large picture of a twelve-week-old foetus on its front page and reports that MPs are planning the most extensive liberalisation of abortion laws for 40 years. MPs will propose that women should be allowed to seek an abortion on the basis of informed consent - dropping the requirement for two doctors&apos; signatures - and to perform the second stage of a medical termination at home rather than at a hospital or clinic. The paper also says that a Commons science and technology committee report on abortion law, due next month, is likely to back the current upper time limit for most abortions of 24 weeks. The Times broadly approves but argues that what must change is &quot;the appalling casualness with which the issue is sometimes treated by those who regard the most profound decisions as a prosaic process.&quot; The Mail is less convinced, and sums up its views in a not-so-rhetorical question, pitched alongside a blurred picture of a 1lb 3oz (0.53kg) baby in intensive care: &quot;On the day a health minister insisted the 24-week limit on abortion does NOT need changing, what does this baby, born this month at 23 weeks, tell us about the law?&quot; Moving on, and Shakespeare&apos;s whining schoolboy with his shining morning face may well be creeping unwillingly to school if he was born in August, according to the Guardian. The paper reports that new research has found that children born in August do worse in school tests, and are more likely to struggle with reading and writing and then to drop out when they reach 16. The study, based on records for every child in the state school system, concludes that August-born children - particularly girls - are penalised by an &quot;unlucky birth draw&quot; which in extreme cases is leading to children being mistakenly labelled as having special educational needs. However, if they do make it into a high-status, well-paid job, then their &quot;second childishness&quot; is likely to be long. The Times reports that life expectancy for professional women has &quot;shot up by 30 months&quot; to 85 years in only the last four years. Women in the top social class - or those who marry into it - have a life expectancy of 85.1 years, are in better shape than ever and have quicker access to healthcare. Their counterparts in the lower social classes, however, face a shorter life (78.1 years).

It pictures a burning house, its windows alight like a leering face, behind a Halloween tableau of scarecrow and pumpkins. Inside the paper are pictures of further devastation and a firsthand account of the blazes which, after raging for four days, have destroyed 1,500 homes destroyed and forced 750,000 people to be evacuated. &quot;The skies were a swirling mass of red, the air clogged with thick, acrid smoke and on the ground, funnels of flames continued to eat away at the surrounding land,&quot; writes Lina Das from west Hollywood. The Times calls it a &quot;very Californian disaster&quot; and reports that massages, acupuncture and stress counselling are being offered to evacuees gathering at the Qualcomm stadium in San Diego. The paper contrasts the scenes at the Californian centre - awash with Starbucks coffee and fresh Caesar salads - with that at the Superdome in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina when thousands sheltered from the floods for several days without proper food or water supplies. President Bush&apos;s administration is hoping to demonstrate that it has learned from its previous mistakes, suggests the Times. However, Chairmaine Marchand, a Louisiana state representative for New Orleans, offers a different explanation: the difference was that it was happening in one of the wealthiest corners of America, rather than one of the poorest. &quot;I guess the fact that California is such a rich state - and a Republican-run state - is a big factor in the help being offered to them,&quot; she said. &quot;Some of my constituents could certainly have done with a massage a couple of years ago,&quot; she said. * Mail: Exodus* Times: Acupuncture and massage help the victims of a very Californian disaster BROWN UNVEILS RIGHTS PLAN Gordon Brown will announce plans for a new British bill of rights today, says the Guardian. The paper previews a speech the prime minister is due to make to the human rights organisation Liberty in which he is expected to renew his commitment to constitutional reform and reject Conservative demands to repeal the Human Rights Act. Three official consultation papers are also due to be published which will contain proposals to ease restrictions on the right to protest near parliament and a limited &quot;confirmatory role&quot; for MPs in the appointment of senior judges. The Guardian calls it an attempt by Mr Brown to &quot;restore his reputation as a prime minister driven by principle&quot;. *  Brown: we need a bill of rights as well as a Human Rights Act MADELEINE MOTHER SPEAKS All the tabloids lead with Kate McCann&apos;s Spanish television interview - although only the Star (&quot;Maddie mum finally cracks&quot;) has the chutzpah to bill it as an &quot;exclusive&quot;.

The Sun reports that filming had to be stopped when &quot;Kate broke down and sobbed uncontrollably&quot;. The interview, the first since the McCann&apos;s were named as official suspects in the case, was given on the advice of the couple&apos;s private investigators. It was designed to publicise a new phone hotline being set up in Spain for information on the missing child after the Barcelona-based investigation firm said the search should concentrate on the Iberian peninsula and north Africa. * Sun: I feel in my heart she is out there* Mirror: Kate&apos;s torment ORGANIC COMPROMISE When is an organic vegetable not an organic vegetable? When it&apos;s been air-freighted in from abroad ... unless it has a Fairtrade label. The ethical dilemma faced by the Soil Association of reconciling the damage done to the environment by air-freighting with the benefits to developing countries of exporting their produce is described by the Independent as &quot;thorny&quot;. The compromise - produce will not be given organic accreditation unless its suppliers can show that they are delivering benefits for their farmers and unless they pledge to reduce their reliance on air-freighted exports by 2011 - it calls &quot;reasonable&quot;. However, the paper also quotes Gareth Thomas, a minister for international development, who criticises the ethical proof required by the Soil Association as beyond the reach of many in the developing world. He says &quot;the last thing we should be doing is penalising the very poorest people for climate change when they are the people who are least responsible for it&quot;. The Guardian takes the opposite view and, calling the Soil Association&apos;s compromise a &quot;fudge&quot;, argues that it should simply have ruled air freight out of bounds.

In its twice-yearly financial stability report, the Bank has raised significantly its assessment of the chances of a serious increase in the price of credit. Should its fears prove well-founded, it thinks the impact on the economy will be more severe than it would have been six months ago. The Telegraph translates this into the possible effect on house prices. First-time buyers are the &quot;most exposed&quot;, says the paper, as they are now paying 20% of their salaries in mortgage interest repayments, the highest proportion since before the last property crash. The Bank&apos;s caution echoes recent warnings that problems in the buy-to-let sector - where rental yields are 2% lower than mortgage costs - may trigger a wider slowdown in the UK housing market, says the Telegraph. * FT: UK financial sector still &apos;vulnerable&apos;* Telegraph: Investors warned of slide in shares GOOD MORNING TIME Sleep is a subject dear to every Wrap writer&apos;s heart, so it&apos;s reassuring to read in the Guardian that this Sunday&apos;s return to GMT should get us back in tune with our natural rhythms. German researchers have found that the change to BST interrupts people&apos;s natural sleep cycles. The study found that while most people were able to quickly adjust to the clocks going back in autumn, in spring the activity pattern of the subjects did not adjust to the clocks going forward. And the changes were particularly difficult for people who prefer to be active in the evening rather than first thing. There&apos;s no mention of the effect on sleepwalking, however, which may be less reassuring for hotel workers. The Telegraph reports (on its front page no less) that a leading budget hotel chain is offering advice on how to deal with naked sleepwalkers, after a huge increase in the number of guests found wandering around in the night with no clothes on. Apparently, many sleepwalked naked into the reception area asking for a newspaper. * Return to GMT gets sleepers back in step* Telegraph: Hotels train staff for naked sleepwalkers BREAKING NEWS &gt;&gt;&gt; The world&apos;s biggest passenger plane, the Airbus A380, has completed its first passenger flight, from Singapore to Sydney.

Photograph: Greg Wood/AFP/Getty Images So the big bird has finally flown. The first commercial flight of the new A380 took off from Singapore this morning headed for Sydney, with a belly full of eager-eyed passengers, some donating up to $10,000 to charity for their place in aviation history. There has been so much fanfare accompanying this new superjumbo from Airbus that, to be honest, it&apos;s a relief that she has at last pulled away from the departure gate with her first paying passengers. If this really was a paradigm shift in flying then it might warrant all this attention, but in reality it illustrates to me just how little we&apos;ve travelled in terms of aviation innovation since 1970 when the Boeing 747 &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot; first took to the air. It hardly compares to the &quot;leap forward&quot; made by Concorde&apos;s first commercial flight just a few years later. I&apos;m sure there will be many who marvel at this new plane&apos;s engineering prowess, but the thing that really counts today is can this plane get as many people from A to B using as little fuel as possible? Much has been made about the A380&apos;s green credentials and most of it, sadly, has been vastly overblown. The plane&apos;s basic principle is sound - if something is going to take to the air it might as well have as many people on board as possible to maximise the fuel used. But on closer inspection the Airbus claims lose a lot of their lustre.  Airbus&apos;s website says that the plane will burn 2.9 litres of fuel per passenger for every 100km travelled, or, put another way, it will emit 75 grammes of carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre. This, says Airbus, is a better fuel efficiency than a hybrid car. Sounds impressive, doesn&apos;t it? But how did it arrive at that figure? Well, I couldn&apos;t find an explanation on the website, and I called the UK office but no one returned my call. So I&apos;m reliant on the National Center for Public Policy Research in the US, who did manage to extract the details from Airbus. Airbus told them that the measurements were based on the A380 carrying 555 passengers at a cruising speed of 900km - but with no luggage or cargo on board. Singapore Airlines has said that its A380s will be set up in the traditional three-class configuration, but will be carrying &quot;less than 480 passengers&quot;. This is because it wants to give passengers more space - including those paying big bucks to travel in its much-heralded &quot;12 ultra-luxurious suites&quot;. (The A380 can, in theory, carry 853 passengers, but it is highly unlikely that any airline will utilise this, except perhaps on some short-range internal routes in, say, China and Japan.) Given that most of these passengers will have hand luggage and a suitcase or two, you can safely assume that the quoted fuel efficiency is going to be less impressive than it first appears. And don&apos;t forget that it is rare for a passenger flight to take off without cramming commercial cargo on board too - or that carrying capacity among the so-called legacy carriers who are ordering up these planes (not in the quantity that Airbus had hoped for) is lucky to ever break through the 80% barrier. This could seem to be unnecessary nitpicking, but the far bigger concern for me is that Airbus predicts these planes will be in service for 40-50 years. With other airlines also investing heavily in Boeing&apos;s rival Dreamliner, which has its own much-puffed &quot;eco&quot; claims, we can safely assume that these two planes will be the principal workhorses of the skies for the next several decades. These are the planes that will serve the huge growth that is predicted for the aviation industry over this period - and is what has triggered the huge concern about aviation&apos;s fast-increasing environmental impact. This goes a long way to quashing any realistic talk of some huge techno fix laying just around the corner - blended-wing designs, hydrogen fuel cells etc - that would mean we would be able fly without a thought for the atmosphere that our plane carves through. Are airlines which have just spent billions of dollars on new planes really going to be in the market for experimental planes in the near future?  Also, look just how long it has taken for the A380 to come to market. Aviation innovation takes decades to literally get off the ground - and so does fuel design - for the simple reason that regulators don&apos;t like to take risks when hundreds of people are being flown at 30,000ft. Therefore, all this talk of biofuels for planes is fanciful in the short- to medium-term - and just look at all the hubbub that biofuels are already causing when it comes to verifying their true environmental credentials. The plain truth is that while these tweaks in efficiency are obviously welcome don&apos;t believe the hype that they are anything more than just tweaks. That flight from London-Sydney, or wherever, will still come at a considerable carbon cost, whichever plane you are travelling in. Somehow getting fewer people into the skies is the key, not beckoning people onboard with inflated eco claims."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/25/greenwashingtheskies", "sentences": ["But then my attention was drawn to an article that claimed &quot;Singapore&apos;s A380 has no first class&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-25T11:00:56Z", "title": "Greenwashing the skies", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment"], "article": "We&apos;re slowly becoming more aware that the forecasted growth rates for aviation threaten all our efforts to stop climate change wiping us off the planet. While the aviation industry has some insightful arguments in this debate - such as people generally liking flying and wanting to fly more - this &quot;end of the world&quot; effect is a bit of a problem for their marketing departments. Generally they just avoid addressing the issue, talking instead about all the wonderful McJobs they&apos;re creating in Slough and Staines. But if you push them, and let them know you won&apos;t be falling for their usual 2% lie (the government says that aviation is responsible for 13% of the UK&apos;s climate change impact), then they eventually fall back on efficiency gains. More people will be able to fly more often to more places, and that&apos;s OK because the new planes will be more efficient, and so the emissions won&apos;t rise accordingly. Everyone&apos;s a winner. Not so I&apos;m afraid. The IPCC&apos;s special report on aviation predicts the efficiency gains as around 1% a year, while growth is at 4.5% globally, and 7% in the UK. But climate arguments are full of predictions - how about something we can see now? And then here it comes, looming over all of our horizons - the Airbus A380. This behemoth of the skies can carry more than 800 people and, according to the marketing blurb, is as efficient as a &quot;normal&quot; family car, per passenger mile. Well, overlooking the fact that driving a &quot;normal&quot; family car from here to Bangkok for a fortnight wouldn&apos;t be the greenest thing you&apos;ve ever done, are they on to something here? John Stewart, the noted anti-aviation campaigner conceded that they could be:  &quot;If - and of course, this remains to be seen - this new larger plane means you could keep the number of flights the same, or even bring them down, then it would be a good thing.&quot;  The caveat is telling. These new planes are unlikely to be &quot;instead of&quot;, but rather &quot;in addition to&quot; existing fleets. More technically, the standard configuration of these planes is not to have 800 economy passengers, but rather 555 passengers, with a mix of economy, business and first class. Boeing claims that the old 747 jumbo, with 467 passengers, is 10% more efficient per passenger than a 555 seat A380. So, it looks as though this huge leap forward is actually a small shuffle back. But then my attention was drawn to an article that claimed &quot;Singapore&apos;s A380 has no first class&quot;. Perhaps the airline industry was right all along, I thought. Alas no. It turns out they have replaced first class with &quot;suite class&quot; (don&apos;t ask) and this particular A380 carries a less-than-whopping 471 passengers when full.

This is not an effective way for them to campaign if their aim is to reduce aviation&apos;s contribution to global warming. The equipment in the news today is Airbus&apos;s new mega-jumbo A380. Singapore Airlines, which has taken delivery of the first copy of this aircraft, has just landed it at Sydney following its first commercial flight. Meanwhile Plane Stupid is rolling out its figures to prove what an environmental disaster it is. Good luck to them, because even if they were absolutely correct in what they claim, their tactics are not going to prevent a single person from travelling on it, or any other aeroplane type for that matter. The equipment is not the villain of the piece, especially since it is more fuel efficient and quieter per unit of load carried than what it replaces. If we are looking for a villain in aviation, surely it is the passenger? It is the passenger who decides to make the journey, or who could - alternatively - choose not to travel. All that the airlines do is meet the demand for travel - they do not create the demand. Maybe the demand was created when aviation was invented, but you can&apos;t put that genie back in the bottle. While we are on the subject of bad guys and environmental guilt, let&apos;s look at an apparently environmentally friendly marketing trick that many airlines have adopted on their websites: they provide the passenger, at the time of booking, with access to a system for offsetting the carbon dioxide they will individually create by their decision to fly. Personally I think this is a marketing &quot;trick&quot; in the sense that I don&apos;t believe that such a system will make any meaningful difference to global warming. But on the other hand it is a really neat trick. It&apos;s neat because it transfers the guilt to the passenger, which is where it belongs. If passengers fail to take up the offsetting offer, they feel guilty for not having done it. If they do choose to pay for an offset, they are admitting their guilt. The airline is off the hook. How neat is that, from the airline&apos;s point of view? It would be easy to bandy figures like Plane Stupid does, but it&apos;s pointless. I might disagree with their maths, but there is one thing they are absolutely right about: by employing new technology and making air traffic control and airports more efficient, the air transport industry can actually become less of a polluter per passenger carried than it is today, but it remains absolutely true that it cannot improve its efficiency as fast as demand for air travel is growing, and the industry admits that. However, if you were to apply Plane Stupid&apos;s arguments, and employ its tactics of targeting the equipment rather than the passenger, aviation would grow at the same rate but not acquire the new, more efficient kit. That sounds rather lose-lose to me, from the environmental point of view. And another thing. Is aviation the most effective target if your objective is to reduce global warming? At 2 or 3% of the global total, hardly. If you want results, try power generation. If you insist on travel, think of this: airlines actually take people somewhere. What about that incredibly fast-growing leisure sector, cruising? Huge numbers of people fly to the port of departure, enter a floating resort that moves around the world, then fly back home. The fact that the resort they are on board actually travels - emitting massive quantities of carbon dioxide and harmful chemicals from its poisonous low-grade fuel - is irrelevant to large numbers of these &quot;travellers&quot;, because most of them never leave the &quot;resort&quot; until it gets back to base. A static resort would perform the same task with less pollution. To be effective, Plane Stupid has to win the hearts and minds of passengers, and persuade them to change their lifestyles.

Starting in 1946 as a third secretary on the staff of Lord Killearn in Singapore, then in the far east to negotiate the withdrawal of British forces from Indonesia, Campbell ended as ambassador in Rome, retiring in 1979. In between, he served in posts as varied as Beijing, New York, Paris and Addis Ababa, along with spells in senior positions in the Foreign Office in London. These were the years of decolonisation - of Britain&apos;s coming to terms with its loss of empire, of its inability to settle its relationship with the emerging European Community, and of its relative economic decline. They were also the years of the cold war, in which virtually all policy decisions had to be taken in the light of the perceived threat from the Soviet Union and its allies. Throughout this time, Campbell was involved - directly or indirectly - in the major international issues of the day. He learned his Whitehall trade from 1950 as private secretary to the then permanent undersecretary, Sir William Strang, before experiencing the rigours of diplomatic life in the bafflingly hostile environment of 1950s Beijing. Two years in the Foreign Office news department from 1959 familiarised him with the ways of journalists. His four years at the British UN mission in New York (when the anti-colonial tide was at its height) covered a series of predicaments, notably the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and required him, as he wrote later, &quot;to listen to what seemed a lifetime of verbal abuse of my country&quot;, adding characteristically, &quot;some of it, I must say, very eloquently expressed&quot;. As head of the western department of the Foreign Office (1965-67), he was responsible for bilateral relations with Germany and France when Britain&apos;s entry into the EEC was being blocked by the French. Then, as head of chancery in Paris under Christopher Soames, he had to pick up the pieces from the so-called Soames affair - the publication by the British government of proposals made privately by de Gaulle to the ambassador, when Anglo-French relations sank briefly to what was almost an all-time low over accusations of British bad faith. An interlude as ambassador at the court of the Emperor Haile Selassie (whom he liked and admired) in Ethiopia from 1969 to 1972 provided colourful relief before Campbell returned to the Foreign Office to become, in due course, political director and, finally, a successful and well-liked ambassador to Italy (1976-79). After retirement, among other appointments he was foreign affairs adviser to Rolls-Royce, director of several companies and chairman of governors of his old school, Sherborne. Born in Devon, Campbell read modern languages at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He brought to the then Foreign Service a first-class mind along with five years&apos; wartime experience as an officer in the Devonshire Regiment. Among gifted diplomats from a similarly cultivated and mildly privileged background, he was noted for his impeccable courtesy and cheerfulness, his consideration for others and his ironic sense of humour, sharp but never unkind. A slightly built, dapper man, always immaculately turned out, he was notably unpompous and had none of the fussiness or self-importance that sometimes goes with being small and clever. Working for him was a reassuring experience. He placed confidence in his subordinates without being slack, and even at times of crisis managed to appear relaxed and in control. He saw the primary task of the diplomat abroad as being to observe, listen and understand so as to give his government good advice on how best to promote the national interest. Personally convinced that Britain&apos;s future lay in joining a united Europe, Campbell was steadfastly loyal to his political masters of both parties, while viewing their vagaries (as well as those of his colleagues) with humorous detachment. Of Soames, booming, hospitable and effective, he remarked: &quot;He was the reverse of an academic. Indeed, such educational establishments as he had attended left only a faint impression on his mind.&quot; Campbell&apos;s elegantly written memoirs, Friends and Colleagues (1988), have the same mixture of perceptiveness, charity, humour and discretion (along with occasional blandness). Not for him the revelations and point-scoring of more recent autobiographers. Like his conversation, the word portraits he paints are illuminating and entertaining without being destructive. He had a particular regard for Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who was &quot;invariably considerate to seniors and juniors alike&quot; and &quot;one of the very few politicians I have known who had nothing of the bully in his make-up&quot;. But he gives sympathetic accounts also of Selwyn Lloyd, Harold Macmillan, James Callaghan, David Owen and even (although heavily qualified) George Brown. It is perhaps not surprising that he found his recreation in the gentlest of the arts, painting in watercolours. His Australian-born wife Margaret died in 1999. He is survived by their three daughters. \u00b7 Alan Hugh Campbell, diplomat, born July 1 1919; died October 7 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/26/theairlineindustry.iran", "sentences": ["For those on board the Airbus A380 for the seven-hour flight from Singapore, there was even more to coo about, from the flat-screen TVs in first-class to the beds in business and the extra legroom in economy, and a menu offering Dom P\u00e9rignon champagne, caviar and lobster.", "The plane, as tall as a seven-storey building and weighing 360 tonnes, can carry 853 passengers in an all-economy configuration but Singapore Airlines, which was the first airline to take delivery of the A380, opted for 471 passengers across the three classes.", "Regular service on the A380 from Sydney to Singapore begins on Sunday and as more airplanes are delivered, Singapore Airlines will use the superjumbo on long-haul flights to London."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-26T15:31:05Z", "title": "Carnival atmosphere for first flight of A380", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Iran", "Travel", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Airbus"], "article": "To the planespotters on the ground, it was a gasp-out-loud moment as the new giant of the skies probed gently through the cloud before a textbook landing at Sydney airport.

An Austrian passenger paid the lowest fare - about \u00a3270 - for a seat in economy class. A fellow back-of-the-bus traveller, Luke Chittock, from Perth, said: &quot;There&apos;s a tad more room in economy, but the way they break up the plane into compartments is fantastic.&quot; He was returning home on an ordinary flight today and expected it would be &quot;a bit of let-down&quot;.

The successful inaugural flight ends a turbulent period for Airbus, which was 18 months late in delivering the plane and suffered an estimated $6bn (\u00a32.9bn) in cost over-runs. The delay embarrassed the European manufacturer, a rival of the US firm Boeing, and some analysts have warned that the gigantic aircraft is a &quot;white elephant&quot;. Others insist the giant plane will revolutionise the industry. Sydney airport invested millions of dollars to be ready for the A380&apos;s arrival. Work included widening and strengthening the taxiways and shoulders of runways to accommodate the plane and in new boarding bridges so passengers could be off-loaded simultaneously from the upper and lower floors of the superjumbo. The chief executive of Sydney airport, Russell Balding, praised the A380&apos;s green credentials. &quot;The significance of the A380 is that it can carry more passengers than other aircraft and it does so with significantly reduced noise and emissions,&quot; he said. &quot;There were people who said a plane this big would never fly, let alone carry passengers, so this is an incredibly important day,&quot; said aviation expert Ian Holland.

Strung out in the middle of the Atlantic in August 2006, jostled by the restless sea, her eyes are round with emotion as she looks into her webcam, all alone on her 23ft rowing boat. Here, on this footage from her website, she looks exhausted, has blisters on her hands and salt-water sores where no girl would want them. Just thinking of the hundreds of miles that she must row to complete her epic journey seems almost too much. It is tempting to write off Savage as courageous but essentially bonkers. Or else as someone so desperate for fame and attention that she is willing to put herself through the misery of a punishing challenge such as rowing single-handed across the Atlantic. But neither of those is true. When we meet this month, a few weeks shy of her 40th birthday, Savage seems thoughtful and modest, the polar opposite of your typical British adventurer. She has been visiting friends in Derbyshire, so we take a walk across the moors above Hathersage and then settle into designer David Mellor&apos;s stylish new restaurant for lunch, where she looks equally at home. Tanned and slim, Savage amazes me by complaining about her weight. She had, she explains, fattened herself for her next project, the Pacific, only to abandon the attempt a few days after starting. &apos;I&apos;m having real trouble losing it again,&apos; she says, ordering salad. Next year she will try again to become the first woman to row solo across the Pacific Ocean, a distance approaching 7,300 miles. Taking on such a colossal challenge on her own raises several questions. Is she, for example, crazy? &apos;Countless people ask me that when they hear what I do, especially sailors. My usual answer is that I feel a lot more sane now than I did in the days when I put on a suit and went to work in an office.&apos; But won&apos;t she go mad, on the Pacific, by herself for months on end? Why not take a big strong man along, or a big strong woman for that matter, anyone to share the difficulties and the loneliness? &apos;It&apos;s laziness, really,&apos; she says. &apos;If there are other people around I&apos;ll let them do it. I&apos;m not stupid.&apos; Savage is far from stupid. But self-reliance is an idea that crops up again and again in her conversation. Adventurers - mountaineers, for example, or polar travellers - speak with reverence about solo challenges. Psychologically, they are edgy, almost disturbing propositions. Most high-achieving sport happens in front of vast crowds. If you succeed, the feedback is instantaneous. When you fail, the whole world watches you do it. On a journey like Savage&apos;s you exist only in your head, listening to every half-formed fear that your subconscious generates. There is no one else there to convince that you are for real, or to pull you along when the mask slips. Then there are the real dangers. Every risk, every problem is faced and overcome alone. &apos;I wanted to find out what I was capable of and to prove to myself that I was self-sufficient,&apos; Savage says. &apos;I really, really needed to be on my own.&apos; That urgent desire she has to be alone in a harsh environment is nothing new. For millennia, people have isolated themselves from the rest of the world, in places hostile to life, on a quest for spiritual renewal. Monks lived in harsh conditions on remote rocks along the western seaboard of the British Isles looking out to sea. Living as a hermit for years at a time to achieve some kind of spiritual breakthrough is a constant of history and myth, from Diogenes to Obi-Wan. In that context, planning to row across the Pacific on your own looks almost reasonable. Seven years ago, however, Roz Savage was the least likely person you would imagine doing something so extreme. The daughter of two Methodist ministers, Savage would change schools each time her parents moved churches. She coped by becoming the teacher&apos;s pet and working hard to please those around her. After studying law at Oxford, where she earned a half blue for rowing, she settled into an apparently enviable life, working as an IT project manager, first in management consultancy and then for an investment bank. In 1996, in her late twenties, she married her long-term boyfriend Richard and they seemed to be on track for the kind of prosperous, comfortable life that most Britons regard as success, complete with a little red sports car. Only Savage was not happy. One day, sitting on the train to work, she sketched out two versions of her own obituary, the first outlining her life as she was living it, the second describing the kind of life she really wanted. Their disparity shocked her. &apos;Things really changed,&apos; she says, &apos;when we got the big house at the end of 2001. I thought that was going to make me happy. I used to read all those interiors magazines. I thought that was what I wanted because that was what I never had. We&apos;d lived in church houses with grotty kitchens. Then we got it and I wasn&apos;t happy. All my friends seemed to be happy moving into their big houses. Why wasn&apos;t I?&apos; She quit her office job to become a photographer, wanting to specialise in travel and landscape. But with a lifestyle to support, there was pressure on her to earn money as quickly as possible. &apos;So I ended up doing babies and weddings and might as well have still been in the office. If I really wanted to find my purpose without compromise, then I had to be able to do what was right for me without taking anyone else&apos;s feelings into consideration.&apos; Her growing urge to escape her life inevitably put pressure on her marriage. &apos;I think he did struggle with why I had to be on my own to do all this. But I had to burn my bridges. You&apos;ve got to commit. I needed to be not relying on him or his income or his emotional support. Leaving him was the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever done, harder than rowing across an ocean. I still love him. I still want him to be happy, and fortunately he is happy with what he has now.&apos; Even though she had extricated herself from her old life, Savage had no clear idea about what she was going to do in the new one. By chance, she read about an expedition that was being planned by the writer and film-maker Hugh Thomson to explore the Inca ruins at Llactapata in Peru. She talked her way on to the project and that gave her the impetus for a three-month trip to South America. Back in London, she wrote a book about her experiences, living rent-free above an antiques shop. Each time she moved house, she dumped more of her stuff, leaving behind the things she thought she owned, but had ended up owning her. Taking a colossal drop in income was, she says, &apos;scary at first. It takes a while to get used to it.&apos; But at least she felt closer to becoming the person she felt she was. &apos;A lot of people feel trapped by circumstance, by the expectations of others or the perception that they need a lot of money. They would like to have a different direction in their lives, but they&apos;re held back by fear or desires that are incompatible with that freedom.&apos; Ethical ways of living had begun to fascinate her, partly in response to her Methodist upbringing, partly from examining her abandoned career. &apos;I went through a lot of my life not being mindful of how I was living it. I wasn&apos;t mindful environmentally, or whether I was on track.&apos; She had half-formed plans of starting a business that would reflect her growing ethical awareness. A coffee shop, maybe, on a boat, that would be organic and fair trade. But despite the good intentions, Savage still needed adventure in her life. When she wrote her alternative obituaries, she says, she thought of those she read in the paper that inspired her most. &apos;They were the adventurers and risk-takers, the people who seemed to have lived many lifetimes in one, the people who had tried lots of things, some of them successes, some of them spectacular failures, but at least they&apos;d had the guts to try.&apos; Then one evening at the Royal Geographical Society, she met her first ocean-rower, a soldier called Daniel Byles - now a Tory parliamentary candidate - who had rowed the Atlantic with his mother, Jan Meek, in 1997. Savage thought: &apos;If somebody&apos;s mother can do it, how hard can it be?&apos; What she didn&apos;t know is that when Byles and Meek set off only a couple of dozen people had rowed the Atlantic and six others had died trying. In fact, until the 1990s rowing the Atlantic was a wildly unpredictable affair. Savage filled her carbon-fibre boat with technology such as satellite navigation and communications, emergency beacons and a solar-powered desalinator. In 1966, when John Ridgway and Chay Blyth became the second pair to row the Atlantic, they had an open wooden dory pretty much like that of the first pair, Norway-born American immigrants called George Harbo and Frank Samuelsen, who made the crossing in 1890. Ridgway and Blyth carried 120 gallons of water and 80 days worth of dehydrated curry, a third of which was spoiled by seawater. More or less out of touch from the world for 91 days, they were told of England&apos;s World Cup victory over scrambled eggs on board a tanker bound for Venezuela that stopped to help them out. When they made landfall on the Aran Islands, off the west coast of Ireland, they learned that the boat competing against them, crewed by two quixotic journalists, David Johnstone and John Hoare, had been found capsized mid Atlantic, its crew missing. Ridgway&apos;s motivation was simple: &apos;I was trying to make my name,&apos; he said afterwards. &apos;That&apos;s why I was doing it. That&apos;s what ambitious people do.&apos; Blyth was equally direct. Like adventurers throughout history, he wanted to escape the rut he was living in. &apos;It didn&apos;t really matter what it was,&apos; he told the Everest mountaineer Chris Bonington years later. &apos;I was keen to have a go.&apos; Blyth&apos;s only experience of the sea before rowing across the Atlantic was on board a cross-Channel ferry. At least Roz Savage had some experience of rowing, albeit on the more placid Cherwell, although the relationship is tangential anyway. &apos;You pretty much just stick your oars in the water and pull,&apos; she says. &apos;If you&apos;ve got both of them in the water at the same time you&apos;re doing well.&apos; She had also spent weeks crewing on a friend&apos;s yacht, although with typical self-deprecation adds that she isn&apos;t much of a sailor. &apos;I have a blind spot for all those ropes.&apos; But her years spent as a project manager did prove useful training for putting together her attempt to row the Atlantic - even if sponsorship was hard to find. Ultimately, she reckons she put \u00a350,000 of her own money into the challenge while remaining blithely optimistic about the outcome. &apos;Even when people were telling me stories about having to drink their own urine, in my mind I was assuming that those things weren&apos;t going to happen to me. I wasn&apos;t going to capsize. So I suppose I wasn&apos;t hearing the things I didn&apos;t want to hear. I just assumed it would be fine and lovely and serene, this wonderful voyage of self-discovery.&apos; When she got out on the Atlantic, Savage found it was anything but serene. &apos;I was on an emotional rollercoaster out there. My mood varied so much on how many miles I&apos;d done that day, or what the weather was doing. I was miserable, especially at the start when I realised just how slowly I was going and how long it was going to take me to finish. And the weather was worst in the first month. It was brutal, a real slap in the face because I&apos;d been so ridiculously optimistic beforehand about how lovely it would be. I really did have my happy filters on.&apos; Twenty-five other boats set off for the Atlantic Rowing Race alongside Savage at the end of November 2005. Savage, however, was the only woman rowing alone, working three shifts of four hours each day, becoming only the eighth woman to row the Atlantic solo. It was a fraught voyage. The first of her four oars broke 12 days out of San Sebastian, a small harbour on La Gomera in the Canary Islands. The second went three days later. Before half her 103-day journey was completed, all four had failed. Savage improvised a serviceable pair by lashing sections of her boathook to them with duct tape. They worked, but the loss of balanced oars left her with shoulder cramps. Some days she would actually go backwards in the face of winds and currents. But she had found the test she had been searching for all her life. Finally, her fate was completely in her own hands, pulling away at her broken oars, her back turned to where she was heading, through an ever-changing sea for more than three months. Did she ever fear she might go mad? &apos;I can honestly say that I never felt lonely. When my satellite phone broke, leaving me totally isolated, I felt a huge sense of empowerment: &quot;This is where the challenge really starts, this is where I find out what I can do when I have nobody to rely on.&quot; The only time I worried I might go bonkers was when this total isolation was combined with strong painkillers and hot sunshine.&apos; She was the last to arrive in Antigua by 19 days, but six boats failed to finish at all. It was, she says, never about the race. Savage found herself featured in newspapers, but she was far from alone. James Cracknell - the Olympic rowing gold medallist - and television presenter Ben Fogle wrote a book and made a documentary for the BBC about their 59-day voyage. But she still faced the common accusation that she had turned an adventure into a career-enhancing stunt. &apos;I did take some flak on my website, calling me a media whore, or whatever. But it comes back to life purpose, without sounding pretentious. I feel the point of me is that I&apos;m not anything exceptional. I&apos;m not claiming to be anything out of the ordinary. I am not especially big or strong or brave or intrepid. I just used to have a really normal life, working in an office.&apos; There was also the question of what she would do next. The obvious target was to row the Pacific alone, something no woman has ever achieved, and Savage moved to California to prepare for the challenge and raise sponsorship. Using her Atlantic success as leverage, she found a proper sponsor, computer network storage manufacturer Brocade. Electing to leave from San Francisco, she spent a frustrating summer waiting for an offshore wind and then lost her sea anchor soon after starting in August. It brought her side on in a gale and, for the first time at sea, Savage capsized. &apos;It was dark. I was lying in my bunk. You can&apos;t get thrown very far, because you can only just sit up in the cabin. But it still hurts. The boat turned 180 degrees and stayed there for a while and I was lying there waiting for it to right itself, which it eventually did. For the rest of the night, every time I heard a big wave I was braced to turn over again.&apos; Bruised and demoralised, Savage concluded that she would be better off accepting the US Coast Guard&apos;s offer of rescue and returning in 2008. Ever the optimist, she says the extra months have allowed her to sort out a book contract and meet sponsors. I ask her whether the whole enterprise isn&apos;t beginning to look like the predictable career she wanted to leave behind. &apos;I feel fulfilled by what I&apos;m doing now, it resonates with my values much more. Now I have enough flexibility. I have no idea where I&apos;ll be sleeping tomorrow night. I&apos;m comfortable with that, but I like to have a longer-term goal, and that&apos;s what the rowing gives me. I get a sense of achievement of looking back to who I was in 2002. This process is more about the kind of person I want to be.&apos; Her attempt to row the Pacific has also become her chance to live more ethically. All the sponsorship she raises goes to marine-environment advocacy group Blue Frontier, and they pay her expenses. The environment is a common theme for adventurers although, since many of them rely on emission-belching corporations and airlines to support their enterprises, the cynical view is that they are more interested in new hooks to raise money. &apos;The irony is not lost on me,&apos; Savage says, and then proves rather knowledgeable on her headline sponsor&apos;s energy-efficient computer servers. She seems very genuine about her environmental advocacy work. &apos;I remember sitting on the US Coast Guard helicopter thinking, &quot;Oh my God, the amount of fuel being burned to haul me out is terrible.&quot;&apos; At least when she is out on the water her carbon footprint is insubstantial. Her journey across the Pacific will absorb much of the next three years, completed in three stages of around 2,400 miles each, stopping in Hawaii and the remote island country Tuvalu en route to Australia. But what will Roz Savage do then? I cannot see her, unlike many adventurers, on the treadmill of thinking up something new to retain the media&apos;s attention. But settling down again seems even less likely. &apos;I have ideas. I&apos;d like to carry on for a few more years before I get too old and decrepit. But in the future I&apos;d like to be in some kind of mentoring role. There&apos;s something very rewarding about provoking people into being more mindful about where they&apos;re going. There are things that are worth being afraid of, like pain or death, but failure or ridicule, these things aren&apos;t going to hurt you, or at least not physically. I suppose I reached a point where other things in my life became more important than those fears. The fear, I guess, of getting to the end of my life and thinking, &quot;Damn, that isn&apos;t really what I wanted to do.&quot; That would be disappointing. Life can be so fulfilling if you can only figure out what it is that you want.&apos; \u00b7 For more information, visit www.rozsavage.com They&apos;re on their own, too ...

Giving educational tours on climate change and organising mini &apos;expeditions&apos; for young people. Tim Cope What did he do? Following in the footsteps of Genghis Khan, Cope, from Victoria, Australia, rode for three years on horseback across the great Eurasian steppe from Mongolia to Hungary. He completed the 6,000-mile journey in September. High point Being reunited with faithful hound Tigon, who had been given to him by a Kazakh guide, after the dog had been stolen by hungry miners. Low point Cope was halfway across Ukraine when he received the news that his father had died. The expedition was put on hold for five months. Lewis Gordon Pugh What did he do?  The Briton, who did not have a swimming lesson until he was 17, is the first person to complete a long-distance swim in all five oceans of the world. High point Overcoming pollution and bureaucratic reluctance to become the first person to swim the 215 miles of the Thames last year. Taking three weeks to complete the distance, he was granted a meeting with Tony Blair as he swam past Westminster. Low point To highlight the effects of climate change in the Arctic, Pugh swam a kilometre in temperatures of -1.7C at the North Pole. Swimming alongside polar bears in only a pair of Speedos, his body temperature dropped to below 35C. &apos;It was the hardest swim of my life,&apos; admitted the 37-year old. And some are still going ... Rosie Swale-Pope What is she doing?  Driven on by the death of husband Clive from prostate cancer, she set out on her 57th birthday, 2 October 2003, from her home in Tenby, west Wales, to run around the world. High point On seeing the Statue of Liberty last month, she admitted: &apos;My knees went all shaky and the memories overwhelmed me.&apos; Rosie had last seen the monument 24 years ago at the end of a 70-day solo sailing voyage across the Atlantic. Low point Contracting frostbite in her big toe and then breaking ribs while making her way across Alaska last year. With help from the National Guard medics, she took just over a month to recover. Where to now? She was last seen, complete with police escort, heading along the New England coast towards Nova Scotia. She aims to arrive home on 1 June 2008, with the people of Tenby invited to run alongside their &apos;bona-fide Forrest Gump&apos; to the finish line. Karl Bushby What is he doing? The former paratrooper is attempting to walk around the world in unbroken footsteps. Now 38, he began his bid aged 29 in 1998, in Chile. High point  He narrowly escaped death twice in becoming the first modern explorer to cross the Bering Strait from Alaska to Russia. The trek across the 58 miles of frozen wasteland took 15 days. Low point Bushby was detained by Russian border troops on the Bering Strait for not entering the country at a correct port of entry. His MP, John Prescott, and Roman Abramovich, the governor of the region, had to intervene for the journey to restart. Where to now?  After resuming this March, he is still in Russia and has 18,000 miles still to go. He does not expect to be back home in Hull until 2012.Tim Ridgway"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/28/news.sport1", "sentences": ["There was no sign that motor racing would ever stage a grand prix in China, Malaysia, or Turkey, much less a floodlit one in Singapore, as will happen next year."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-27T23:22:00Z", "title": "Special report: Games without frontiers", "tags": ["Sport"], "article": "Monday morning, local time, in November 2020 and Manchester United have just landed in Mumbai, where they play Milan in a Champions League match on Wednesday night. The number of fans who travel with them, home and away, has dropped to a couple of hundred since United started playing European games in China, the United States and India, but, even so, a few of those supporters, the wealthier ones with time on their hands, have been here before. Some had a memorable trip when they came to watch Lancashire lose in the World League Twenty20 play-off final two years ago; a dozen or so others were here only three months ago, to watch the 2020 Olympic Games, the first Olympiad to be staged on the subcontinent. The Olympics were a late arrival. There are many, many more attractions for sports fans in this part of the world, because this is where the growth is. The multibillion-pound sports-tourism industry makes travel easy and plenty of United followers have friends who have been over to watch the Indian Grand Prix - now rated the best on the circuit for atmosphere, with three Indian drivers in the world top 10 - the cricket, and the Indian Open, which has seen off the USPGA and become golf&apos;s newest Major. Money talks, especially from Asian banks. Those who have not been to Asia before are looking forward not just to this trip, but to the March game, should United qualify, in Shanghai, probably against Bayern Munich. It makes a change from last year&apos;s jaunts to Miami and Boston. There is talk of Australia joining the circuit, but so far no one in Sydney or Melbourne has been able to come up with the \u00a3100million guarantee for the clubs. And the journey, even on Virgin&apos;s &apos;satellite shuttle&apos;, is that much more tiring. If United were scheduled for a Saturday game - most games kick off at primetime 7pm now - after a midweek trip to Australia, they would be back and ready to play, but ideally they would want a Sunday slot and if they have to buy one it may cost as much as \u00a325m. Talking of the weekend, this will be &apos;the big one&apos; for boxing, the richest four days on the sporting calendar. Not so long ago there were fears that boxing might go under, as UFC grew and grew, but tradition still counts for something even in the 21st century, and the ultimate fighters were seen off. By money, of course. The world&apos;s biggest brewery, still an American company, saw a way to tell the world: &apos;We&apos;ve been around a long time, and we&apos;re the world&apos;s best-selling beer.&apos; So they put in billions of dollars to buy up everyone in boxing and turn back time. There are now eight weight divisions, eight world titles - all sponsored - and everyone who cares will be able to name all eight of them after the Thursday-to-Sunday championships in Las Vegas. The forecasters cannot see how they will be able to afford it, but they said that about the China National Bank deal that gave birth to golf&apos;s world tour - and the booming target-golf circuit - and just look how wrong they were. A fifth major, held in China, looks a certainty now. Of course, &apos;being there&apos; is not what it used to be for those United fans. If you really must fly all the way to India to watch your team, good luck, but hardly anybody does because they are more than happy with their virtual sports studio back home. The dull old days of sport on television are long gone and now your holistic media centre in what used to be the lounge all but puts you there, behind the goal, in the grandstand, at ringside, on the 18th green. If you don&apos;t like that loudmouth over there, you can always move. Now, a quick flick through the e-pages to see what&apos;s going on today. Plenty about London&apos;s NFL team; the Pacific islands&apos; rugby play-off that earns the winner a guest spot in the Eight Nations; more headlines about the landmark appeal-court hearing over who owns the rights to cloned racehorses; a big preview to London&apos;s NBA game tomorrow - after beating Boston and Los Angeles in early-season games, they could top the league with victory over Madrid - and the indispensable guide to viewing in the sports room tonight. Andy Murray is in the turbo tennis grand finals in New York. He last played a grand-slam event in 2016, but he is still making a mint on the turbo circuit. No match lasts longer than 45 minutes, the whole thing is over in three days. Worth staying up for... Before you start thinking &apos;What a lot of futuristic, fictional nonsense&apos;, it is worth doing two things. First, listen to what some of the most important people in the sports industry think: not those constrained by working for a specific club or league, or for a governing body who have been around since the 19th century, but those whose job is to be innovative, move fast and gain an edge on their competitors. People with financial clout, people who, whether you agree with them or not, have vision. Second, take yourself back in time. Instead of going forward to 2020, go back 20 years to 1987 and ask yourself this: would anyone have believed it if they had been told what sport would be like in 2007? With so many American sports executives in London over the past week, for today&apos;s NFL game at Wembley, there has been widespread talk about the possibility of Premier League matches being played in the United States. West Ham&apos;s Eggert Magnusson caused a stir when he said: &apos;I can see that happening sooner rather than later - it would be good for the game,&apos; and he has an unlikely ally in Steve Bruce, the Birmingham manager who says, &apos;Anything that promotes the game has to be good. I really can&apos;t see a downside to the idea.&apos; A more likely scenario, given that there would not be such an outcry from fans of all league clubs, is the playing of Champions League matches outside Europe. &apos;That could very easily happen,&apos; says Joe Bailey, who played a key role in bringing the Miami Dolphins to Wembley for today&apos;s ground-breaking game, &apos;if they [Uefa and the clubs] think that, by doing so, they can generate new customers and develop new business relationships. That&apos;s for the strategic planners to try to figure out.&apos; Today&apos;s game is &apos;part of a concerted effort to establish ourselves internationally, going after half-a-dozen key territories to create some level of foundation&apos;, says Alistair Kirkwood, an NFL expansion executive. Why now? &apos;The best time to change is from a position of strength. In a way, when you have full stadiums it is more difficult to justify taking a regular-season game elsewhere, but that&apos;s what you have to do. &apos;What seemed like a whimsical idea a few years ago can now be seen as possible. If there is a business rationale for doing it there will be opportunities to play Champions League games outside Europe.&apos; Miami Dolphins v the New York Giants today is just the start. Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, can see the Super Bowl coming across the Atlantic, too. &apos;There&apos;s a great deal of interest in holding a Super Bowl in London,&apos; Goodell says, &apos;so we&apos;ll be looking at that.&apos; Bailey, who believes the American sports industry is 10 years ahead of the rest of the world, says the Wembley game, the first competitive NFL match played outside North America, is &apos;a foreshadowing of a lot of other things that are going to happen, not just to the NFL but to sports in general. Just think what&apos;s going to happen when India starts getting really active [in sport]. Think of what&apos;s going to happen in China.&apos; American basketball is all too aware of what is happening in China and is making a big marketing push there. &apos;Businesses, whether they are US, multi-nationals, UK, or Asian based, are not talking about borders, that&apos;s the game changer here. It&apos;s a global opportunity,&apos; says Heidi Ueberroth, who heads the worldwide expansion programme of the NBA. Can she see foresee Manchester United playing in Miami? &apos;Sure.&apos; Manu Sawhney is India&apos;s top TV sports executive. As managing director of ESPN Star, Asia&apos;s number-one sports broadcaster, he oversees a company expecting exponential growth. &apos;India is steadily developing into a multi-sports market,&apos; he says. &apos;While cricket continues to grow and is the most popular sport, viewing figures for English soccer have increased by 58 per cent throughout Asia in five years. Other sports, such as motor sport, golf and tennis, are also gaining viewers.&apos; Sawhney is a big fan of Twenty20 cricket, which has transformed the market in India. Women are drawn to Twenty20 far more readily than to longer forms of cricket and the recent World Championship final between India and Pakistan drew an audience of 400 million - 16 times bigger than the best British figures for a sports event. He and other top executives say &apos;short&apos; forms of sport will play a key role in the future and sports will have to adapt. The aims of the main sports remain the same - to score goals, tries, runs and points, or to be first over the line - but the rules have successfully been tweaked in recent years, leading to a faster, more entertaining spectacle, certainly in football and both codes of rugby, and in Test cricket. The biggest changes have been in the packaging and presentation of sport - and in viewers&apos; attention span. &apos;There is an inevitable conflict between what the sports federations want and what the public want,&apos; says Greg Dyke, the former director general of the BBC who was head of sport at ITV earlier in his career. &apos;Governing bodies always put too much emphasis on tradition.&apos; Guy Kinnings, head of golf at IMG, the sports agency and marketing group, predicts: &apos;There will be a growth in short-form golf because people will have even less leisure time by 2018 and golf needs to have a form of the game that allows it to be played in, say, an hour. I&apos;m sure this will be showcased by some of the top pros.&apos; Donald Trump, a keen investor in golf and one of the world&apos;s most famous businessmen, disagrees about &apos;short golf&apos; but sees a big future for the sport. &apos;Golf is very important for a certain group of Americans,&apos; Trump tells Observer Sport. &apos;It&apos;s not like football or baseball, it&apos;s the very high end of the market which advertisers love because they spend a lot of money on product. It&apos;s very important, it&apos;s very influential. Tennis has lost its mojo. Just lost it. Roger Federer may be the greatest player ever, but for some reason tennis is just losing ground.&apos; Maybe tennis must reinvent itself, too. It, like squash, is dabbling with a short-form version. American football is trying to push &apos;Arena Football&apos; - an indoor version of gridiron - as an Olympic sport. The value of live events will increase as viewers&apos; habits change, along with their means of consuming sport. The TV will be displaced by computer screens and there will be no such thing as scheduling as we know it. You will be able to watch Coronation Street whenever you want to - which gives sport a big advantage. &apos;In a world where you can download anything, you can&apos;t download live sport,&apos; Dyke says. &apos;Anything live becomes more important. The price paid by broadcasters will continue to go up.&apos; Sir Martin Sorrell, one of the world&apos;s foremost names in marketing, says: &apos;The power of big sports events will be there forever and they are becoming more, not less, important. There is a growing pool of money that wants them and a very limited number of sufficient quality and size.&apos; Sorrell - who is chief executive of WPP, one of the world&apos;s biggest advertising companies - adds: &apos;What companies are looking for are mass events that have a very strong appeal worldwide.&apos; If there are not enough to go around, but the money is there to &apos;invent&apos; some - as has happened with Twenty20 cricket - who knows what might happen? Back in 1987, no satellite TV company had yet been given a licence to operate, and those that existed, long before Sky&apos;s current conformation, were losing a fortune. There were no millionaire footballers and no paid rugby union players (at least not officially). Test cricket was shown on BBC, or at least home series were - no UK broadcaster had ever screened an England tour live, beyond a single session from Australia in 1983. The total income for all football from TV companies was roughly one tenth of what every single Premier League club is now paid. The highlight of the rugby season was the Five Nations, not Six, and the game was played by doctors and bankers and farmers, who look like matchstick men alongside today&apos;s hulks. Backers of the first World Cup, in New Zealand, lost \u00a31m. At club level, long-forgotten names such as Orrell, London Scottish, West Hartlepool and Moseley would be watched by a few hundred spectators. In tennis, Wimbledon had just made the radical decision to use yellow balls, rather than white ones, and commentators bemoaned the disappearance of wooden rackets. There was little sport on a Sunday, no football on Monday or Thursday, and no pull-out sports sections in the daily and Sunday papers. There was no sign that motor racing would ever stage a grand prix in China, Malaysia, or Turkey, much less a floodlit one in Singapore, as will happen next year. Britain&apos;s top boxer was Barry McGuigan and everyone knew who he was because his fights were on BBC1. In 1987 there was no such thing as the Premier League, and any thought of a Russian, or many Russians, investing in British football - plagued by hooliganism and hated by the Government - would have been dismissed as madness, not least because Russia was a communist country. Foreign players were still a curiosity, and no one knew which teams were in La Liga, never mind who played for them. The Iron Curtain was still there, Germany was split, and nobody in Estonia would have dared dream that their Soviet-run state would be free to play at Wembley as an independent nation, as they did this month. Wembley itself was an old dump that featured, that year, an FA Cup final won by a team who are now in what was then the Second Division (Coventry City) and the following year by a team who no longer exist (Wimbledon). Everton were the Football League champions. To qualify for the European Cup you had to do what Everton did and win the title, though all English clubs were banned from Uefa competition because of the Heysel disaster two years earlier. Teams from Romania, Portugal and Holland were champions of Europe in successive years from 1986-88. The Cup Winners&apos; Cup was a big deal. So were snooker and Saturday afternoon horse racing. Fans were fans, not customers of &apos;the guest experience&apos;. Very few wore replica shirts and most paid on the gate, stood up to watch and expected to be treated like penned cattle. And whoever would have thought Indians would want to watch English football - or, come to that, any football? Now, India is a magnet, as that 400 million Twenty20 audience shows. The newest form of cricket takes another big step next year with the launch of the Indian Premier League, which uses both the Champions League and the NFL as models for its format. Franchises will compete for a first prize of \u00a32.5m. The Commonwealth Games will be held in Delhi in 2010. In the same year the first Indian Grand Prix is expected to take place in the same city, with an Indian team on the grid, backed by the Kingfisher brewery. Golf&apos;s Indian Open will start in February - as part of the European Tour, not the Asian Tour - and other sports are coming up fast. India has never been as keen on football as the rest of Asia, but that is changing. Manchester United are helping to popularise football in India this week, holding a skills camp for more than 5,000 children aged 10-16 at the Nehru Stadium in Goa. Brian McClair, the former United and Scotland star who now heads the club&apos;s academy, is leading the pilot project, which was launched at the invitation of the All India Football Federation (the Indian FA), with the backing of billionaire businessman Sunil Mittal. Manchester United Soccer Schools and Nike are partners in the project. &apos;Investment in cricket and hockey has been going on for many, many years, and this [investment in football] is a very ambitious project,&apos; says McClair. &apos;Sport is a massive part of Indian life, and football can be part of it. It will grow, I&apos;m sure of that.&apos; McClair believes it will be &apos;a minimum of 10 years&apos; before football takes a real hold, but one top player could make a huge difference. Dale Hobson, international development director of Manchester United Soccer Schools, says, &apos;If you had just one Indian player in the Premier League, football would go into the stratosphere here. The scope and scale of Indian football could be colossal.&apos; Vijay Mallya, the man behind the F1 team - which he has named Force India Formula One - is also keen on football and says &apos;it can be as popular as cricket&apos;. he predicts that India &apos;will not only emerge as a global superpower in economic terms, but also in sporting terms, over the next five years&apos;. And not just on the cricket pitch. &apos;We have a very young demographic in India. We produce more than a million graduates a year. They are getting good jobs. They are basically looking for an alternative to cricket, and Formula One meets their aspirational needs. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there&apos;s a humongous increase in television viewership of Formula One. For the sentiments of the Indian people, Formula One was always perceived to be out of reach. Now we have an Indian car on the grid it demonstrates that India has truly arrived.&apos; Nearly half the 1.1 billion population is under 20 and in a few years that figure will be 55 per cent. Over the next year, more than 130 new cable television channels will be launched across the country. There are 200 million mobile phones in use in India and predictions of 600 million within three years. And Indians love to follow sport on their mobiles. &apos;The young take their media habits with them,&apos; Sorrell says. &apos;If you are not part of their habit now you most definitely won&apos;t be in their future.&apos; Two-thirds of all overseas sales of the Premier League are in Asia. The World Cup will surely come to India: Fifa&apos;s Sepp Blatter went to Delhi in April, armed with cliches and describing the country as &apos;the sleeping giant&apos; of world football. Another &apos;sleeping giant&apos; is China, whose population is 150 million more than that of India. The Chinese New Year was watched by a billion people on the state broadcaster CCTV and the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing next year will be seen by 800 million within China alone. There are more mobile phone users than in Britain, America and Germany combined, and 35 million of them followed the last football World Cup via mobile news updates. Basketball, the world&apos;s second most popular team sport after football, is booming, and an estimated 300 million Chinese play it. While India hopes for a footballer to make his name in Europe, China already has a global hero in basketball, the 7ft 6in Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets. Yao Ming is the iconic figure in the NBA&apos;s push to promote the American game in China. Timothy Chen, one of China&apos;s best known business executives, has just become chief executive of the new Chinese subsidiary, NBA China. He was Microsoft&apos;s top man in China until he resigned last month. As well as negotiating new deals for TV and internet rights, he will work on the possibility of launching a new, NBA-branded league. &apos;We believe the potential of a market with four times the population of the United States ultimately must be at least what the United States is,&apos; says Adam Silver, the NBA&apos;s deputy commissioner. Asian money is also behind a radical plan in boxing. The new president of the governing body of amateur boxing (AIBA), Ching-Kuo Wu, of Taiwan, wants to set up a world league. Amateurs would move on from Olympic glory straight into the professional league, cutting out the promoters. Tom Virgets, chairman of USA Boxing, says, &apos;We are talking about an investment of $200m to $300m... to make this happen.&apos; The Asians are confident they can find the backers. For now, though, despite all the potential in Asia, America dominates. &apos;The sports industry in the US is $300billion and growing,&apos; says Miami Dolphins&apos; Joe Bailey. Money from NBC still props up the Olympics. The network has paid $2.2bn for the 2010 and 2012 Games, around two-thirds of the IOC&apos;s TV income, despite evidence that the audience is ageing and, according to Dyke, declining. The big team sports appear to have the edge over the Olympics. Today, Miami Dolphins supporters have a taste of globalisation, and it has not gone down well. Dolphins season-ticket holders have only eight home games a season and many lament the loss of this weekend&apos;s prime fixture. &apos;It&apos;s bullshit!&apos; wrote one of many irate Dolphins bloggers in Florida. &apos;It&apos;s all about more dollars for the owners and the NFL.&apos; Others are so outraged at the game being switched to London that they have started a petition to have Goodell sacked as NFL commissioner. &apos;Many fans are upset about the proposed outsourcing of American football games in general,&apos; says a statement on Miami fans&apos; anti-globalisation, anti-Goodell website. &apos;We welcome all [fans] who are opposed to outsourcing of any major league sporting events to join us.&apos; Those are views with which British sport fans might soon empathise.

Why? I don&apos;t want to kill him. I think he felt that somehow we stand as critics of good food, which is rubbish. But he isn&apos;t alone. An article I wrote last week for the Times that gently suggested people should simply eat less meat for ecological reasons has drawn the most astonishing amount of vitriol - everything from &apos;Hitler was a vegetarian&apos; to &apos;This woman should die&apos;. I wrote the piece as patron of Compassion in World Farming. A third of crops grown are now fed to intensively reared animals and farming them also uses masses of our most precious natural resource - water - and destroys millions of acres of forest. There doesn&apos;t need to be this desperate urge to devour meat. People were once happy with vegetables and fish. When I was a young girl, a chicken was almost like caviar - you&apos;d eat it seldom and it would taste delicious. These days, it&apos;s the lowest of the low, reared in horrendous conditions. I have been thinking about how some men retain their looks in old age and the secret is ... dark eyebrows. Look at Gregory Peck and Sean Connery. I bet the same will happen to George Clooney. It was working with Christopher Lee that led me to wonder. He is 85 and despite the white beard, he is terribly handsome and completely switched-on. I have been playing his wife in a new film called Boogie Woogie. It&apos;s all about the art world and the title comes from the name Mondrian gave to his series of geometrical drawings. A previous time when we acted together, I was laid out on an altar waiting for him, in his very last Dracula film! People keep asking me about the meeting between BBC presenters and Mark Thompson, the director-general, because it was reported that I was there. In fact, I was appearing on BBC World at the time, talking about the Dalai Lama receiving the Congressional Gold Medal in America and as I came out of the studio, a journalist asked whether I&apos;d been at the meeting. When I said I hadn&apos;t, he looked so downcast that I said I was quite prepared to give my views, in any case. In fact, I&apos;ve written to Mark Thompson, in particular about the selling of Television Centre, and he wrote a lovely long letter back thanking me for my views. I&apos;m afraid they won&apos;t make the slightest difference. The BBC needs to remain a world-class, blue-chip company. Its international reporting is peerless, level-headed and reliable. When I was a child growing up in the Far East, I&apos;d hear the opening music of Desert Island Discs as I went to bed. My father would be off in the jungle and my mother at her Singer sewing machine and it was reassuring. That side of the BBC has always reminded me that, no matter what else is happening in the world, there is this sane society ticking on. As an actor, I&apos;m very sad about the sale of Television Centre. One of my first jobs was acting in a Jilly Cooper sitcom called It&apos;s Awfully Bad For Your Eyes, Darling. I was paid \u00a360 an episode and it seemed an incredibly generous rate. But the real excitement was the community at the studios: you&apos;d walk past Doctor Who in the corridor and queue up behind an alien for tea and biscuits. Now they&apos;ve spent a lot of money on offices for middle management - I don&apos;t know what these people do. Tea with Griff Rhys Jones and director Harry Hook was a pure delight. We were discussing Byron in Albania, Somerset Maugham in the Far East and Noel Coward in Singapore. He wrote Private Lives in a hotel room there in three days with a raging fever. Griff has come up with a series about writers on their travels and has just done Kipling himself. I&apos;ve appeared in Private Lives and The Letter and simply think Byron was a rock star. His time in Albania came to my attention when Lord Rothschild very kindly had my husband and me to stay in his house in Corfu. He and Lord Sainsbury are financing the excavation of Butrint in Albania, which is just half an hour away. It had turned into nothing over decades of neglect, and now temples, streets and baths are appearing. An Albanian I met there told me how he wished they could attract more tourists. Byron went there to kick his heels after being accused of an affair with the ambassador&apos;s wife in Cyprus and spent his time riding and touring. And beginning Childe Harold&apos;s Pilgrimage. Anyway, I was not deterred by the death threats from the meat lovers from a walk in the park with my granddaughter Alice, who is four-and-a-half. It was a beautiful day and we wandered through Hyde Park to look at the Peter Pan statue and then down to the Serpentine to feed the ducks, before stopping to feed ourselves on cakes and apple juice. Alice is in the middle of a rather long half-term. It lasts two weeks, which, in fact, I think is too long, because it gives her a chance to forget all about school, which is, in any case, in a bit of a mess. The best thing to do would be to pay teachers more money, so we secure the best, reduce class sizes and buy back playing fields - the politician speaks! In fact, I could never go into politics because I&apos;m far too impatient and I&apos;d want to be a dictator, albeit a benevolent one, I would hope ...

What&apos;s seldom mentioned is the quality and contribution of America&apos;s scientists and engineers, and the size of their budgets. Institutions such as universities may get a nod, as may America&apos;s technology production, but research and development and the small groups that do it are often forgotten. Yet scientists are a cornerstone of the success and dominance America has built over the past century. A congressionally requested report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, which was released by the National Academies in late 2005 and has gained traction on the Hill, says: &quot;[US economic] vitality is derived in large part from the productivity of well-trained people and the steady stream of scientific and technical innovations they produce. ... Today, Americans are feeling the gradual and subtle effects of globalization that challenge the economic and strategic leadership that the United States has enjoyed since World War II.&quot; Back in September, I wrote that America is out of touch and behind the times on climate change and economic reform. It is mired in a stagnant war that the rest of the west has abandoned or is abandoning. American global influence is in decline, the country having lost the respect of allies and the credibility to lead. As we&apos;ve seen yet again in last week&apos;s brinkmanship by Turkey, American diplomacy has all the vim and vigour of Fred Thompson. For now America remains the world leader, but it&apos;s moving steadily from superpower to first among equals. Nowhere is this more evident than in the sciences. In the half-century following the second world war US universities were magnets for students and academics from around the world. Crucially, many foreign graduate students studying the physical sciences, biological sciences, IT and engineering stayed after graduation. As the Gathering Storm report notes: &quot;Government spending on R&amp;D soared after World War II, and ... as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) reached a peak of 1.9% in 1964.&quot; In the last six or seven years, however, that tide has turned. Overseas institutions and companies are increasingly competitive, and federal and state funding for science and engineering has fallen significantly, to just 0.8% of GDP. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are sucking up federal money, with President Bush last week asking Congress to raise the war budget for 2008 to $196bn. That&apos;s quite an opportunity cost. As Tom Friedman put it in his New York Times column on Iraq recently: &quot;Can we pay for it and be making the investments in infrastructure, science and education needed to propel our country into the 21st century?&quot; The answer, judging from speakers at the TechNet summit at Berkeley earlier this month, is no. John Chambers, the CEO of computer company Cisco systems, said the US has long had the international advantage with its great universities, R&amp;D funding and venture capital. But other countries are churning out engineers and scientists in greater numbers than ever from increasingly competitive institutions. By one estimate, America produces roughly 75,000 engineers per year. China graduates ten times that number, and India, close to a million. The Gathering Storm report states: &quot; In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in natural science or engineering. In France, the figure is 47%, in China, 50%, and in Singapore, 67%. In the United States, the corresponding figure is 15%.&quot; If the implications of that aren&apos;t clear enough, I&apos;ll let Intel Corporation spokesman Howard High spell it out for you: &quot;We go where the smart people are. Now our business operations are two-thirds in the US and one-third overseas. But that ratio will flip over the next ten years.&quot; Where America remains dominant is in venture capital. No one else comes close. But money alone can&apos;t slow successful start-ups in Bangalore or stop South Korea&apos;s broadband penetration leaving American for dead. &quot;We&apos;ve got five years,&quot; Chambers said. Professor Laura Tyson, from UC Berkeley&apos;s Haas Business and Public Policy Group, nodded repeatedly as he spoke. She said America urgently needs to improve the quality of math and science teaching in its public schools and invest more in R&amp;D. According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), which monitors science funding, the US is still responsible for 34% of the world&apos;s total R&amp;D spending by both government and industry. That&apos;s the good news for Americans. But for most of the 1990s it was 40%. China and Japan now account for 13% and growing. Kei Koizumi, who watches America&apos;s R&amp;D budgets for the AAAS, told me the 2008 budget, which still needs to be passed by Congress, continues that worrying trend, leaving the federal research portfolio 7.4% below the 2004 level. That&apos;s quite a second term, Mr President. China and South Korea, by contrast, are increasing government research by 10% or more each year. One interesting note from the AAAS data: the only reason the decline isn&apos;t steeper is America&apos;s increasing support for weapon systems development. This year&apos;s Nobel prizes captured the mood. For the first time this century, Americans were not among those awarded the physics and chemistry prizes. If you&apos;re looking for a glimmer of light, you might find some in the America Competes Act passed by Congress in August, authorizing billions of additional science funding. But the way the US system works, it&apos;s an authorization bill only. It doesn&apos;t appropriate any new money. At the moment it&apos;s all talk and no trousers. Of course, the US still dominates our world. It retains huge advantages in terms of lifestyle, wealth and knowledge - for now. For the sake of democratic principles, we can only hope the next president can rebuild its reputation and sway. But I can&apos;t see it being able to recapture its dominance in those areas of infrastructure, education and, especially, science. It&apos;s hard to ignore the scientists and business leaders who wrote the Gathering Storm report when they write, bluntly: &quot;We are worried about the future prosperity of the United States.&quot; As the US slides, other countries are catching up too rapidly. I think Americans will look back at the second half of the 20th century as the pinnacle of American power and influence."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/30/limitinggrowth", "sentences": ["There would be nothing sensational about this if China were a country like Luxembourg or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-10-30T19:30:00Z", "title": "Limiting growth", "tags": ["Climate change", "Economics", "Pollution", "China", "US news", "European Union", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Since the cold war&apos;s end, all kinds of barriers have come down, and the world economy has fundamentally changed. Until 1989, the global market encompassed between 800 million and one billion people. Today, it is three times larger, and growing. Indeed, we are witnessing one of the most dramatic revolutions in modern history, and it is occurring almost unnoticed. From a model applicable to the minority of the world&apos;s population, &quot;Western consumer society&quot; is becoming the dominant economic model of the world, one to which there is increasingly no alternative. By mid-century, the lives of seven billion people might be governed by its laws. The west has established the economic model of the 21st century, with its hitherto unheard of standard of living, and almost all nations and regions are trying to equal it, no matter what the cost. When, in the 1970&apos;s, the Club of Rome http://www.clubofrome.org/ issued its famous report on the &quot;limits to growth [Word document],&quot; the reaction was one of concern. Over the years, however, as the world economy continued to grow without interruption - and, in the current age of globalisation, seemingly without limits - the dire predictions of the Club of Rome have become increasingly an object of ridicule. And yet the Club of Rome&apos;s basic insight - that we live and work in a finite global ecosystem, with exhaustible resources and capacities - has returned to challenge us again. The world is not preoccupied today by the &quot;limits to growth&quot;, but awareness of the consequences of growth on Earth&apos;s climate and ecosystem is becoming prevalent. China, for example, needs annual growth rates of 10 per cent to keep its huge economic, social, and ecological problems under control. There would be nothing sensational about this if China were a country like Luxembourg or Singapore. But China has 1.3 billion people. So the consequences of its economic growth are much more serious. Global demand for energy, raw materials, and food is increasingly influenced by rising demand in China and India, whose combined population is 2.5 billion. Other large and populous emerging countries in Asia and South America are following in these giants&apos; footsteps. Steadily rising prices of raw materials, agricultural products, and energy already reflect fears about future shortages. These undesirable consequences of the expansion of world markets have assumed alarming proportions within a relatively short period of time. China is on course, this year or next, to overtake the United States as the world&apos;s largest CO2 emitter, even though its per capita emissions are only one-fifth or even less of the US level. What will the world look like when China reduces this difference to one-half? And India is following close behind China in its level of carbon emissions. Will the global ecosystem be able to absorb these additional pollutants without considerable changes in the ecosphere? Obviously not, as a large majority of climatologists are now warning. These basic data have been known for a long time, and only a few deny that rapidly accelerating man-made climate change is occurring. But one might conclude from the bizarre debates we engage in about climate change that what the world needs is a change in its political and psychological mood, rather than a profound social and economic transformation. So, despite grand rhetoric, very little is being done. Emerging countries continue to grow every year. The US has almost totally backed away from the global fight against pollution, and, through uncontrolled growth, solidified its position as the world&apos;s leading polluter. The same pattern holds true for Europe and Japan, albeit on a slightly smaller scale. In view of this global challenge, the G8 countries have made a heroic decision: the eight richest industrial countries - which are also the largest polluters - promised to &quot;seriously examine&quot; cutting their emissions in half by 2050. This rhetorical heroism is enough to leave the world speechless. Indeed, it remains to be seen if the EU will even be able to implement its promise to cut CO2 emissions by 20-30 per cent by 2020. So far, the EU has not really come up with any practical ways to do this. But the solution to the challenge of global climate change is as plain as day. The only chance of improvement is to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and emissions. This must happen in the emerging countries, and even more urgently in the old industrial economies. Such decoupling can occur only if we do away with the illusion that pollution is cost-free. We can no longer get away with subsidising economic growth and standards of living at the expense of the global environment. Human population has simply become too large to be able to afford it. Doing away with this illusion requires the creation of a global emissions market - still a very distant goal. It also requires more energy efficiency, which means a reduction of waste in both energy production and consumption. Rising energy prices already point in this direction, but this knowledge has yet to register. Finally, it requires a technological and politico-economic breakthrough in favour of renewable energy, rather than a return to nuclear power or coal. In essence, then, we are confronted by a three-pronged challenge of a new, &quot;green&quot; industrial revolution. Coping with this global challenge also offers an enormous opportunity for future prosperity and social justice that we must seize. Of course, there will be many powerful losers as we make these changes. They are not about to accept their &quot;disempowerment&quot; without a struggle. At the moment, they still seem to have the upper hand, as evidenced by much talk and no action. This is precisely what needs to change.

Ernie Els, who leads the money list by \u00a3152,000 from Padraig Harrrington, had a chance to secure his third order of merit title but instead is in south-east Asia, where he is honouring a contract he signed to play in the Singapore Open and, to use his own words, filling his &quot;wheelbarrow&quot; with money. &quot;Valderrama is a great course and it&apos;s a great end-of-season event,&quot; the South African had said when asked to explain his absence from Spain. &quot;But, you know, how can I say it; the end of the year you&apos;ve got the wheelbarrow out, too. You want to cash in a little bit. It just happened this tournament is the same week. It&apos;s unfortunate.&quot; Unfortunate is one way of putting it, although farcical and embarrassing come close to the mark, too. Once upon a time the order of merit was worth winning but the shifting landscape of the world game and the changing attitude of professional golfers has stripped the title of its former lustre. If the man in the pole position does not care enough to make the trip to Spain, why should the general public or indeed tournament sponsors? In fairness to Els, he and other notable absentees this week such as the US Open champion Angel Cabrera and Lee Westwood, have fallen victim to a organisational mess which saw the European tour schedule its grand finale in the same week as an event in Singapore which is prepared to pay enormous sums to the likes of Els and Phil Mickelson to appear. No explanation for the conflict has been forthcoming although it could be that politics have played their part. The European tour has been at loggerheads with the Asian tour over its alleged encroachment on to the latter&apos;s so-called patch. If this was another skirmish in that ongoing battle then it is clear the European tour, and one of its flagship events, have ended up as the losers. Westwood, another who chose to play in Singapore, was in no doubt yesterday where the blame lay, accusing the European tour of &quot;mismanagement&quot;. &quot;It is disappointing. I&apos;d like to have played in both tournaments and hopefully it will be corrected in years to come so I can play in the last couple of events of the European season,&quot; the Englishman said, adding that he had signed a contract last year to play in Asia this week. &quot;I stick to my word.&quot; Among those who have made the trip to Spain to play for a first prize of \u00a3465,000 are Harrington, winner of last year&apos;s order of merit, and Justin Rose, who trails him by \u00a3450. Both can overtake Els but only if they finish in the top three. Henrik Stenson and Niclas Fasth need to win and have other results go their way. &quot;I&apos;m giving this the same preparation as I did for the majors this year,&quot; Rose said. &quot;I&apos;m in an exciting situation although it&apos;s not one I necessarily expected to be in at the start of the year. Winning the order of merit wasn&apos;t one of my goals as I was only playing in 11 [European Tour] events, but it&apos;s proved if you play well in the right ones, you can do it. It is a huge bonus that the order of merit is even an option and I&apos;d love to make the most of it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/01/politics.economicpolicy", "sentences": ["Next are Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden followed by Germany, Finland, Singapore and Japan, with Britain and then the Netherlands completing the top 10."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-01T00:13:29Z", "title": "UK slips to ninth in competition league", "tags": ["Business", "Politics", "Economic policy", "Economics"], "article": "The Conservatives attacked Gordon Brown&apos;s economic record last night after a new survey showed Britain had slipped down international rankings on economies&apos; competitiveness. The World Economic Forum&apos;s annual global report put Britain in ninth place in the world league for overall competitiveness, down from second place last year. Shadow chancellor George Osborne said: &quot;This report makes grim reading for anyone who cares about Britain&apos;s ability to compete in the face of the new economic revolution. As we become less competitive and not such a good place to do business, Britain is paying the long-term price for a decade of Labour government. &quot;In this competitive global economy, we should be heading up the league table, not falling down it. Gordon Brown has been running the economy for the last decade and he needs to take the blame.&quot; But the Treasury pointed out that this year&apos;s WEF report had changed the way it worked out the figures for the second year in a row. Last year&apos;s report originally placed Britain 10th -not second - and down from ninth the year before, although the 2005 report in fact had the UK in 13th place. The Treasury was unhappy with its sub-ranking of 46th in the world for the stability of the UK economy, which has grown steadily for more than two years. The WEF ranked Kuwait, Algeria and Saudi Arabia top for economic stability. A Treasury spokesman said: &quot;As this report clearly sets out, the UK remains one of the most competitive economies in the world and one of the best places in the world to do business. &quot;Thanks to reforms to the tax and regulatory regimes, including the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7, the UK is well placed to benefit from the opportunities of globalisation. &quot; The report places the US as the world&apos;s top-ranked economy for competitiveness, having downgraded it to sixth place last year. Next are Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden followed by Germany, Finland, Singapore and Japan, with Britain and then the Netherlands completing the top 10. The report also warned that the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US presented a danger to the US and global economies. It urged countries to establish structures and policies to underpin growth and development, given the growing uncertainties facing the world economy.

I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the right way to do anything.&quot; Montgomerie tees off just after noon today, 50 minutes ahead of Justin Rose and Padraig Harrington, both of whom need top-three finishes to overcome Els and win the order of merit. It promises to be a thrilling four days.

For the record, Padraig Harrington and Justin Rose, third and second in the money list, are battling it out to overcome the absent Els. The South African&apos;s decision to pitch up at the Singapore Open and not Spain can, depending on your taste, be viewed either as evidence of his integrity in honouring a contract or of his avarice in going where the appearance money is significant. But more than anything it can be seen as the final confirmation that the Order of Merit title - given to the biggest money earner on the European Tour - is a worthless bauble. What a difference a decade makes. In 1995, when Colin Montgomerie managed to hole a five-footer on the 72nd hole at Valderrama to narrowly beat Sam Torrance, people genuinely cared about the Order of Merit. Golf has changed since then, of course. The best players are now global players and one European Tour season pretty much melds into the next. The good news for the players is that they are richer. The bad news for everyone else is that Order of Merit is now the Carling Cup of golf. Players like Els would never say as much, of course, but who could blame him if that was his view? Apart from anything else he isn&apos;t even the tour&apos;s biggest money earner. That distinction belongs to Tiger Woods, who has won enough cash in four majors and three world golf championships - all &quot;European tour events&quot;, technically speaking - this year to have won the Order of Merit by a distance. Come to think of it, given his dominance of the game&apos;s biggest events, Tiger might have beaten Montgomerie&apos;s record of seven successive Order of Merit titles if he had actually been eligible. His problem is he doesn&apos;t play the required 11 European tour events to qualify for membership and is therefore disqualified. I&apos;m sure Tiger will get over the disappointment. As for those who would like European golf to have an end-of-season climax full of drama and interest? Well, they will just have to learn that in this life you can&apos;t get everything you want."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/02/golf.sport1", "sentences": ["God knows how dark his mood will have been once he got inside to discover Els had accused him of &quot;shooting his mouth off&quot; when he criticised the South African for playing in Singapore this week instead of here."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-02T00:10:19Z", "title": "Golf: Harrington and Rose battle back after setbacks", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Padraig Harrington"], "article": "The changing landscape may have stripped the prestige from the European Tour&apos;s Order of Merit title but nothing, it seems, can diminish the competitive spirit of Justin Rose and Padraig Harrington, two of the game&apos;s best players who yesterday overcame adversity to leave themselves in contention after the first round of the Volvo Masters here. For the Englishman the problems were medical; he had food poisoning and was throwing up just before stepping on to the 1st tee. For the Irishman it was more a case of simple bad luck as he picked up a penalty when his ball moved on the 7th green after he had addressed it with his putter. For everyone there was also the challenge presented by windy conditions and a course set up as if for a major. Yet Harrington and Rose, each of whom needs to finish in the top three to overtake Ernie Els and win the Order of Merit title, finished the day on the leaderboard, with the Open champion on level par and Rose a shot better after a round of 70 which included a hole in one at the par-three 3rd. That left them well within touching distance of the tournament leader, Graeme McDowell, whose 68 was sensational. &quot;If the weather stays like this, the winning score will probably be around even par,&quot; McDowell said after his round. Few around Valderrama were inclined to disagree after a day that saw some big names take a battering, not least Paul Casey, who ran up two eights in his 80. All of which put the efforts of Rose and Harrington in perspective. The Englishman started the better, following his eagle at the 3rd with a birdie at the fifth. A par four at the next opened up a six-shot lead over his playing partner, Harrington. Lesser spirits might have taken the hint this was not to be their week but the Irishman is a cussed soul, not to mention a devotee of sports psychology, and looked at his early deficit in a positive light. &quot;The fact that he [Rose] was under par showed me that it could be done,&quot; he said. &quot;If he had been four over par and I had been four over par, I think the two of us could have spiralled into oblivion and shot six or seven over.&quot; On the back nine Harrington ran in five birdies to come home in 32. &quot;A terrific performance,&quot; Rose said. &quot;Today was the kind of day you could have played yourself out of the tournament. With a poor back nine it would have been a long road back.&quot; The road ahead for both players is hardly a cakewalk, not least because McDowell stands between them and their goal. It was not long ago the Irishman, who had enjoyed a stunning career in American college golf, was viewed as Europe&apos;s next star. He lost his way somewhat but over the last few months he has started creeping up the world rankings and has begun to resemble the player he ought to be. Among the other favourites Henrik Stenson and Niclas Fasth, both of whom retain a slim chance of winning the Order of Merit, returned scores of 76 and 75 respectively. Colin Montgomerie played well enough to get himself under par as his round neared its end but two bogeys on the last two holes saw him finish with a one-over 72 and storm off into the clubhouse with a face like thunder. God knows how dark his mood will have been once he got inside to discover Els had accused him of &quot;shooting his mouth off&quot; when he criticised the South African for playing in Singapore this week instead of here."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/02/ianblack", "sentences": ["Bahraini Sunnis like Mr Abdel-Rahman watched with alarm as the &quot;Shia crescent&quot; snaked its way across their small island - the size of Singapore - bringing mass demonstrations onto the streets in solidarity with the embattled Shias of Iraq and Lebanon, reinforcing old communal prejudices."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-02T11:38:22Z", "title": "Bahrain: Sunni side up", "tags": ["World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Bahrain"], "article": "It is late morning in the Bahraini parliament and deputies are debating the small print of a law on reciprocal employment rights with other Gulf countries. Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of the Islamist opposition group al-Wifaq, is making a point in elegant, classical Arabic - his white dishdasha and matching turban magnified onto a giant video screen. Shortly afterwards, the Speaker calls a break - just time for a quick fruit juice or noon prayers on thick Persian carpets. This everyday scene in Manama is unremarkable, but it is evidence of a smoothly functioning - if limited - parliamentary system in one of the most fragile regions on earth. And with a crisis looming over the nuclear ambitions of its Iranian neighbour, Bahrain&apos;s uncomfortable position on the great fault line of the Muslim world is being keenly felt. The split is clear just from gazing down at the chamber from the visitors&apos; gallery. Sheikh Salman and colleagues are immediately recognisable as Shia Muslims. A couple of them in black turbans are sayyids - senior religious scholars. Some are in western suits. Other MPs wear Sunni headdresses over their robes. The official emphasis is on Bahrain as a nation. &quot;We are Bahrainis first, opposition or not,&quot; insists the Crown Prince, the American-educated Sheikh Salman Al Khalifa. &quot;It&apos;s dangerous to think of things here in terms of Sunni and Shia,&quot; warns police brigadier Tareq bin Dina. It may be undiplomatic for a visitor to dwell on what are dismissed as &quot;sectarian&quot; issues, but it is impossible to avoid them. &quot;Everyone here knows who is from which community,&quot; volunteered Hashim, a young man whose ID card (middle names - Hussein and Ali) give away his Shia faith. Black flags strung between the minarets of mosques in a town south of Manama echo the Shia centres of Najaf in Iraq, Qom in Iran and the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Bahraini Shia homes often display pictures of Ayatollah Khomeini or Iran&apos;s current supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei - religious icons as well as political leaders. Statistics are hard to come by (probably deliberately) but estimates suggest Shia Muslims form two-thirds of Bahrain&apos;s population of 750,000 (a figure itself open to question). Shia political groups boycotted the election in 2002 but al-Wifaq (&quot;Accord&quot;) changed tack last year to take 17 out of 40 seats in the house of representatives (an upper chamber is appointed by the king) despite crude gerrymandering that made it far easier for Sunnis to win. King Hamad is widely praised for the reforms of the last five years, but the political climate - the &quot;war on terror&quot;, the invasion of Iraq, Israel&apos;s war with Hizbullah - has been tough. &quot;His Majesty made these decisions before George Bush brought his cowboy democracy to this part of the world,&quot; sneers Anwar Abdel-Rahman, the outspoken editor of the pro-government daily Akhbar al-Khalij. Bahraini Sunnis like Mr Abdel-Rahman watched with alarm as the &quot;Shia crescent&quot; snaked its way across their small island - the size of Singapore - bringing mass demonstrations onto the streets in solidarity with the embattled Shias of Iraq and Lebanon, reinforcing old communal prejudices. Signs of nervousness are clear in a murky story of the naturalisation granted to an unknown number of non-Bahraini Sunnis - as many as 40,000 according to al-Wifaq. Judicial gagging orders prevent discussion but this is a highly charged issue. The government says it is about importing skills, while critics complain the goal is to alter the demographics to boost Sunni dominance. Evidence of discrimination is rife. Shias cannot serve in the armed forces and few occupy senior official positions elsewhere. Recently Shias have found they cannot buy land in Sunni areas. &quot;There is a tendency in the establishment to make sure Sunnis stay on top and keep the Shias down and out of sight,&quot; says one foreign observer. There is gossip about divisions within the Al Khalifa dynasty, with the crown prince constrained by conservative figures who have the ear of his father. They are influenced by the Saudis, who brook no nonsense from their own Shia minority in the oil-rich eastern provinces across the causeway from Bahrain. Still, the government is wise to modern ways of branding strategies, marketing and slick PR. (I was one of a group of journalists invited to visit Manama on an official trip this week.) And it does have a good story to tell about being the Middle East&apos;s freest economy. Bahrain&apos;s oil reserves, small compared to its neighbours, are running out, though record high prices are still helping fill state coffers. Diversification is well advanced and the financial services industry is the main source of revenue. Growth is a healthy 7%, though efforts to reduce dependence on expatriate labour have been halting. Worryingly, though, suggest both Bahrainis and foreigners, there is sense that the political part of the reform process has ground to a halt. Al-Wifaq acts like a loyal opposition but it urgently needs progress that can justify taking part in the next election. &quot;We are under extreme pressure,&quot; says MP Khalil al-Marzooq. Iran looms large on the horizon, but although there is talk of Iranian support for Shia activists there is no proof of it, let alone of the sinister &quot;sleeper cells&quot; run by Hizbullah or the Revolutionary Guards. These, in theory, would be activated throughout the Gulf if the US or Israel attacked Iran. &quot;The Bahrainis have no evidence, but I think they believe it,&quot; says a western diplomat. &quot;Iranian influence has been exaggerated beyond all imagination and that helps justify repressive measures,&quot; argues Mansour al-Jamri, a former exile and now editor of the opposition paper al-Wasat. Historic mistrust of Iran deepened when President Ahmadinejad came to power and there was a major upset this summer when the editor of the Iranian Kayhan newspaper (close to the Tehran regime) called Bahrain part of Iran - an echo of Saddam Hussein&apos;s claim on Kuwait. &quot;That,&quot; says the foreign minister, Sheikh Khaled, &quot;was very disturbing.&quot; Bahrain, home to the US 5th fleet, is likely to be a target for retaliation, like Qatar next door with two big American airbases, if President Bush decides to hit Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities. One of them, Bushehr, is directly across the Gulf. &quot;If a war starts anything can happen,&quot; Sheikh Khaled cautions. &quot;Iran is led by a Muslim Shia theocracy. It is difficult to see it under attack and Shias in Bahrain keeping quiet. A conflict between Iran and the world in this region will be catastrophic. We do not want to wake up one day and see skies black and hear sirens blaring. We are much closer to Iran than Washington is.&quot; The opposition agrees. &quot;War could cause more than physical destruction,&quot; warns the al-Wifaq MP Jasim Ali. &quot;An attack on Iran will be seen in Bahrain as an attack on the Shia establishment. The sectarian divide will grow. If there is a war then everything else will stop. It&apos;ll be security first - and nothing else.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/02/schools.english", "sentences": ["In the 2003 TIMSS survey, only Singapore and Chinese Taipei did better than England, which scored significantly higher than all other countries, with Japan, Hong Kong and the US performing at a similar level."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-02T13:54:05Z", "title": "Reading skills for English pupils among highest in world", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "UK news", "English and creative writing"], "article": "English primary children compare well in reading and science with other countries, but &quot;middling&quot; in maths, today&apos;s primary review of international standards shows.

A parallel primary review report on assessment, published today, concluded that levels of literacy in England have remained almost static since the 1950s, though maths scores have improved steadily. But in maths England compares badly internationally. In the 1995 Trends in Mathematical Sciences Study (TIMSS), English children in years 4 and 5 (age eight to 10) compared poorly with other developed countries in the subject. Fourteen countries outperformed England, including most other English-speaking countries. England&apos;s relative performance did improve significantly from 1995 to 2003, however, and more than other countries that took part in both surveys. In 2003 English pupils outperformed Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland the US and eight other countries. England compares well internationally in reading.

But the report warns that English primary pupils&apos; relatively high attainment in reading skills is at the expense of their enjoyment of reading. Science at primary level is also &quot;something of a success story&quot;, according to the report. England&apos;s performance has also improved in science since 1995.

Barring a sensational performance from someone down the leaderboard, or a shocking one from either of the two men at the top of it, this tournament, and with it the tour&apos;s Order of Merit title, will come down to a head-to-head contest between Padraig Harrington and Justin Rose, the two best European players of 2007. After 36 holes it is most decidedly advantage Rose, whose second-round 68 was the best of the day by two shots and good enough to give him a four-shot lead over Harrington in second place. The two will be paired together for today&apos;s third round and, assuming they continue to play with the authority and determination they have shown thus far, for tomorrow&apos;s decisive 18 holes, too. It promises to be nothing less than thrilling, and nothing less than the Order of Merit title deserves after the absence of Ernie Els - who was leading the money list but chose instead to honour a contract to play in Singapore - threatened to reduce it to a farce. Needless to say, the two protagonists are more than up for the challenge that lies ahead. &quot;My ideal scenario would have been to be 12 shots ahead of Justin at this stage,&quot; Harrington joked after signing for a round of 71 and a 36-hole total of 142, level par. &quot;But this is what I would have wanted - a head-to-head between Justin and myself. Justin is four shots ahead of me, so that&apos;s an issue. But a bigger issue is that he is playing extremely well and the fact that he is probably hungry for a win to cap off a great year.&quot; If this was an attempt by the Irishman to ratchet up the pressure on Rose by reminding him that despite some terrific performances this year he is yet to take home any silverware, then it threatens to be about as effective as a tickling stick in a boxing gym. In his younger days, the Englishman might have cut a fragile figure but he&apos;s a big boy nowadays, physically and mentally. It also helped his cause yesterday when he woke up to discover his problems with food poisoning were over. He stepped on to the 1st tee looking like a man revived, and he played like one, too. He made par on the first two holes and almost had a hole in one at the 3rd for a second successive day, sending a beautifully controlled five-iron to less than a foot. That was great, but better was to come on the back nine, where he ran in four birdies. The pick of the litter came on the par-five 17th, where Mick Doran, his sage of a caddie, talked him out of going for the green in two on the grounds that &quot;we could still make a birdie laying up&quot;. Wise counsel, although it took a curling 25-footer to fulfil Doran&apos;s prediction. A par at the last was good enough for a 68 and a two-round score of 138, four under par. Like Harrington, Rose was pleased to get back into the clubhouse and discover they would be playing together. &quot;At the end of the day, it doesn&apos;t really matter who you play with but when you&apos;re a professional golfer part of your job is to put on a show and entertain people. So this will be exciting for everybody.&quot; It will, but especially for the suits at European Tour headquarters in Wentworth. After 20 years at Valderrama, it has become clear over the past few days that next year&apos;s Volvo Masters will be the last at which the Order of Merit will be decided. It has been a long and, mostly, glorious run and the contest that lies ahead over the next two days between Rose and Harrington could be up there with the best.  No wonder the suits were happy last night, and to make them even happier Els missed the cut in Singapore. Conflict cools  Ernie Els and Lee Westwood have drawn a line under their disagreement with the European Tour over the scheduling issue that prevented them from playing in this week&apos;s season-ending Volvo Masters. Both missed Valderrama due to a conflict of dates with the Asian Tour&apos;s Barclays Singapore Open, which they had been contracted to play in. Yesterday the European Tour&apos;s chief executive, George O&apos;Grady, denied Westwood&apos;s charge that the tour has mismanaged its schedule. Responding to O&apos;Grady&apos;s comments, Els, who missed the cut, said: &quot;I think a lot of things have been said but the truth&apos;s the truth and I know the truth.&quot; Westwood, who is four shots off the lead on four under after a second-round 67, said: &quot;I think everybody wants it over and done with so this mistake doesn&apos;t happen again next year. Both sponsors have suffered. Barclays also lost out on a couple of players who would have ordinarily been playing here in Sergio [Garcia] and Padraig [Harrington]. So you have to think that Barclays are disappointed too.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/03/ethicalfood.fooddirectory8", "sentences": ["A recent trip to Indonesia and Singapore has given the friendly and funny owners a new yen for all things Asian and this influence shows itself in the shop with a new range of hot satay and peanut sauces."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-03T18:47:38Z", "title": "Organic shops and delis: Scotland", "tags": ["Food directory", "Life and style", "Food & drink", "Ethical and green living", "Environment"], "article": "Berits &amp; Brown Main Street, Kippen, Stirling, Stirlingshire FK8 3DN, 01786 870077 6, Wilson Street, Glasgow, G1 1SS, 0141 552 9980 beritsandbrown.com Berits &amp; Brown launched in rural Stirlingshire and is doing so well that it not only has a new branch in Glasgow but several shops are launching throughout the UK in diverse places such as Marlborough, Poulton-le-Fylde and Ludlow.

She is keen to work in the field of ethical and sustainable tourism. &quot;I did one year of a law degree in Poland, where I&apos;m from,&quot; she says, &quot;then I started a tourism degree in Singapore, where I studied for two years. To be honest, it was an accidental choice because most of the courses that were available there were related to banking or finance, so I thought tourism would just be more interesting. But it ended up being a great choice. From the first term I was swept up in it.&quot; She is interested in working in the sustainable sector because it reflects her own values. &quot;I&apos;d like my work to be a bit more meaningful than simply working for a big commercial organisation,&quot; she says. &quot;If I can add a little bit to the sustainable development of communities and to the environment, then that is what I want to do.&quot; We asked Tricia Barnett, the director of Tourism Concern, to &quot;mock interview&quot; Marta for an entry-level graduate job. Then we asked Tricia what she thought. Tricia says ... We&apos;re a campaigning organisation that works against exploitation in all levels of tourism. It&apos;s the biggest service industry in the world but the impact on local people, their environments and their human rights is largely invisible. So we aim to challenge the growth of the industry that doesn&apos;t take those things into account. It&apos;s difficult, because when people are on holiday they don&apos;t want to think that their lovely hotel might be using up the local water supply. The UK tourism industry is pretty much the only one that&apos;s even begun to think about these things and that&apos;s because we&apos;ve campaigned so hard. Obviously, it&apos;s a David and Goliath situation, so the people who work here have to be imaginative and creative in how they approach our campaigns - and passionate about the cause. Marta convinced me that she shares that passion and is genuine in her desire to work towards ethical tourism. She interviewed extremely well and I enjoyed meeting her very much. She&apos;s open, frank and she thinks. She considers a question before she answers it and gives thoughtful responses. If I was recruiting, I&apos;d be looking for someone with an understanding of development issues, a good political understanding of how trade functions around the world and a good strategic approach to challenges. But specific experience isn&apos;t necessarily the key to doing the job well. Marta was able to talk about how she had taken a strategic approach to things she&apos;d done as a student, for example. And an international background is by no means essential, but it has always been incredibly helpful if people who work with us have travelled or lived abroad, and have been able to see for themselves the gulf between wealth and poverty. I would say that Marta should think about tailoring her CV to the jobs she applies for. It was very corporate in tone and didn&apos;t fit with the culture of the NGO world. I&apos;m not sure I would have shortlisted her on the strength of it. But having found out more about her, she had a really good understanding of the issues that we face and the skills that are required to deal with them, which I thought was very impressive. Had I been interviewing her for a real job I would have considered her for the role. Marta says ... It was great to go to Tourism Concern. They do such a brilliant job and it was very inspiring to meet Tricia. When you think about the work they do, taking on the big giants of the tourism industry, it&apos;s amazing. I enjoyed the interview. It was less formal than I thought it might be. There was a friendly atmosphere and I felt quite relaxed. When I look back on it, I think that there were a few questions I could have answered better, but on the whole I&apos;m quite satisfied with the things I said. It helped me realise that when I am asked a question about how I would deal with a hypothetical situation in the future, I can go back to my previous experience to show how I&apos;ve done things in the past.  \u00b7 If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to graduate@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/03/roadtrips.sydney", "sentences": ["Singapore Sling?"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-03T23:49:00Z", "title": "Anita Sethi: London to Sydney by bus", "tags": ["Road trips", "Sydney holidays", "Australia holidays", "Travel"], "article": "Namaste, readers. Here we are, half-way through, but the middle of the road is much like a mid-life crisis (or my mid-20s quarter-life crisis): you begin pondering the path you&apos;re taking. Should I change direction? When I awake from this dream, should I return to real life or remain on the road?  Such questions rear their heads as unfavourable weather makes it too dangerous for us to travel the fabled Friendship Highway joining Nepal and Tibet, so we must backtrack to India and fly from Calcutta to Bangkok.  Only days earlier we were in Varanasi, the perfect place to cleanse bad karma. Our guide insists we offer prayers to Mother Ganga, so I rise with the early birds of the bus and take a boat ride across the Ganges. I place my marigolds and candle on the river and whisper my wishes to the water - health, happiness and a shoulder massage from a Certain Someone Who Shall Not Be Named. My flame is promptly blown out.  &quot;Every second, try and enjoy yourself. Be strong. Life is full of happiness,&quot; counsels the loquacious guide. &quot;If I keep talking too much, stop me,&quot; but his sermon is instead cut short by a voice bellowing, &quot;NAMASTE, GANGA MARKET,&quot; and I turn to see a small child in a jewel-filled boat and glittering beads thrust before me. &quot;Very nice corals?&quot; he asks, but as I reach for my rupees, the river carries us far away. It is 6.19am and the sun smudges the sky, bodies are being burnt on funeral pyres on the ghats, the town awakes.  That night, under a full moon, four of us discover the heavenly Music Paradise Hall where classical Indian music resounds, carefree notes from flute, drum and sitar. &quot;Everybody happy?&quot; asks the tabla player and, for these moments, we are.  But 20 hours on a roller coaster bus journey from Varanasi to Kathmandu, past small children carrying great golden haystacks on their heads, is the last straw for some. The road takes its toll on minds and bodies, and in Kathmandu the group will split: some will rejuvenate here before reconvening in Bangkok; others will venture independently into Tibet, rejoining in Ko Samui; a couple might leave for good, patience ground thin by the relentless turning wheels; only a handful, it seems, will stay on the bus for the bumpy ride to Calcutta.  I can&apos;t decide anything until I&apos;ve dragged my flu-ridden self to a pharmacy. We&apos;re flying round Mount Everest tomorrow and I&apos;ll be damned if this bug keeps me earthbound. In the internet cafe, a power cut (as regular here as rain in Manchester) snuffs out my words, yet ignites conversation with the boy next to me, volunteering at an orphanage, and soon sparks are flying. Bob Marley wailing from the nearby Reggae Caf\u00e9 tempts us inside and, having not stepped foot in a proper bar since leaving Europe, I drool over the cocktail menu. A Screwdriver? Singapore Sling? Tom Collins?

As a billionaire media mogul and proprietor of one of the world&apos;s biggest teams, the future prime minister of Italy was uniquely qualified to suggest radical changes to a game that was about to be transformed by the television age. Italian sides had just had their coffers swollen by a huge cash payment from TV companies, money they would use to buy the world&apos;s best players and finance what was then the most successful league in Europe. Berlusconi, like other broadcasters, realised that rows of empty seats look dreadful on TV and that teams roared on by passionate fans in packed stadiums make a more compelling spectacle for television viewers who, a generation ago, were slowly becoming as important as those who paid at the turnstile. The gates of San Siro may never have been flung open, but it is easy to see the logic behind Berlusconi&apos;s comments. He was among those with the foresight to see where sport in general, and football in particular, were heading. He could see that there was about to be a dramatic shift in power away from paying fans and towards armchair viewers. The &apos;real&apos; fans had the passion; the consumers had the money. The amount of money coming into the game from TV was unprecedented 15-20 years ago. It started with the development of satellite television, and coincided with Berlusconi himself building, or rather buying, the original &apos;dream team&apos; of modern European football, the Milan side - the last to win the European Cup two years running - that featured Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten. Although grounds are better, as is the standard of football in many cases, ticket prices have gone up along with the cost of watching games on TV, pricing plenty of supporters out of the market and infuriating many disgruntled fans. The Italian clubs would now go bust without TV money and English clubs playing in the Premier League, which quickly overtook Serie A as the richest in Europe, are rapidly becoming more dependent on it, too. They will reach a major milestone next year, according to accountancy firm Deloitte, when TV money will generate half of their total income for the first time. As recently as 2005, cash from broadcasters provided just a quarter of turnover and, in the 1991-92 season, the one before the Premier League was formed, when Leeds were crowned champions, Ian Wright was top scorer and gate receipts still generated half of the revenue of clubs in the top flight, TV money provided a mere nine per cent of turnover. Peter Robinson, the former Liverpool chief executive, remembers the start of the 1985-86 season, when football was not televised at all. &apos;There was no deal in place. It only came back on at New Year and the value of the contract when it was signed was about \u00a3600,000, which covered all four divisions.&apos; He remembers that negotiators on both sides of the table had reservations about the value of live televised football. &apos;The broadcasters would play down the value,&apos; he says. &apos;They&apos;d say things like, &quot;It&apos;s a long time for people to be sitting down,&quot; claiming that most TV programmes were no more than 45 minutes. The idea of selling something lasting an hour and three quarters was diffi cult. They genuinely didn&apos;t know how popular it was going to be.&apos; Years earlier, Robinson recalls being asked over to his counterpart at Everton, who wanted to hatch a plan restricting the club&apos;s appearances on Match of the Day. &apos;They wanted to make a deal whereby no club was shown more than once a month because they thought they were being overexposed and they were worried other clubs would see what their tactics were.&apos; It seems incredible now that anyone could voice such concerns and fear that live televised football would kill off the game. Twenty years on, the latest three-year rights deal with Sky Sports and Setanta is worth \u00a31.7billion and Sky, whose sporting empire now encompasses rugby, cricket and even darts, showed more than 36,000 hours of live sport last year. Other venerable sporting institutions have accepted Sky&apos;s cash, with wildly different results. In less than a generation, sport&apos;s finances, especially football&apos;s, have been turned on their head, with startling implications for supporters. &apos;How do you define a &quot;fan&quot; these days?&apos; asks Dan Jones, the Deloitte partner who produces the company&apos;s annual football finance report. &apos;Is it one of the 40,000 people who buy a season ticket or is it one of the four million who tune in on TV?&apos; Many supporters, who have been rudely awakened to make a midday kick-off or arrived home after midnight on a Saturday because their team were playing at 5.15pm at the other end of the country, would claim they already know the answer to that question and bemoan the arrival of the fair-weather fan. Recent research carried out by ticket agency Getmein.com claimed that the British are now a nation of armchair or &apos;fake&apos; fans, who claim they love high-profile teams but have never seen them play, a finding that will resonate with those who attend games. Figures extrapolated from a survey of 3,000 people show that an estimated 30 million men and women boast about being &apos;big fans&apos; of certain clubs, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool the most popular. But less than half (46 per cent) of those who claim to have a life-long passion have ever seen their teams play in the flesh and another one in 10 will do so only once in a lifetime. Armchair fans are also fickle, the survey found, with just over a quarter maintaining an interest in their team for three years. Furthermore, 2.6m armchair fans will change allegiance five times during their lives. The biggest sports are becoming global brands, and new technologies are making it easier for them to reach audiences, and new customers, abroad. Television has transformed sports that already boast a truly international audience rather than a domestic one. Early this morning Joe Calzaghe fought Denmark&apos;s Mikkel Kessler in Cardiff for the unifi ed supermiddleweight world title. Two Europeans fighting in a European city - but the fight started well after 1am, so the American audience could watch on Saturday evening primetime and the US pay-TV network that put up a huge chunk of the prize money could recoup its investment. The arrangement is not reciprocal. When fights are staged in America, as Ricky Hatton&apos;s next contest will be, British fans have to stay awake until the early hours to watch. The American market rules. The organisers of next year&apos;s Beijing Olympics have agreed to hold swimming heats and finals early in the morning, delighting NBC, one of America&apos;s big four networks, but alarming some athletes, who have complained loudly about the change. Since NBC had paid $2.2bn (\u00a31.1bn) for the 2008 and 2012 Games - providing at least half the International Olympic Committee&apos;s television money - the competitors&apos; appeals will fall on deaf ears. In a year&apos;s time, drivers at the Singapore Grand Prix, the latest addition to Formula One&apos;s global circus, will race on a floodlit track for the first night-time race, timed to suit the western TV companies that pay millions to screen it. Next year&apos;s MotoGP in Qatar, which will be broadcast by the BBC, will also be held at night so it can reach an early evening audience in Europe. American and European audiences are accustomed to TV schedules being built around their own lifestyles and habits, but that could change, along with the sporting calendar. The famous 2005 Champions League final between Berlusconi&apos;s Milan and Liverpool started at 9.45pm and finished well beyond midnight, thanks to the time difference in Turkey. There were complaints from fans in France about 9pm kick-offs at the recent Rugby World Cup, but that was the time the TV companies wanted and that is what they got. In the future, matches may kick off at lunchtime to suit a larger audience in, say, the Far East, for fans who will never visit Old Trafford or Stamford Bridge, and who will be watching over the internet or on their mobile phones. If match-by-match income from Asia ever exceeds that from Europe - and it could happen - the &apos;consumer&apos; money will do all the talking and the paying fans will have to accept it. Yesterday&apos;s game between Arsenal and Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium kicked off at 12.45. Both clubs requested a Saturday match because they have midweek Champions League fixtures and early starts are now commonplace. A long-standing agreement between the football authorities and the broadcasters prevents the live televising of matches between 2.45pm and 5.15pm on Saturdays, so as not to affect attendances at games with 3pm kick-offs. But lunchtime kick-offs also guarantee a big audience in Asia, where the Premier League is hugely popular and a time difference of five to nine hours means they are screened on prime-time Saturday evening television. In the last three-year TV deal, the Premier League netted \u00a3625million for foreign rights and 55 per cent of that came from the Asian market. Few people know more about the value of live rights than Phil Carling, the influential head of football at sports marketing agency Octagon. Carling, who ran the FA&apos;s commercial department from 1996 to 2000, says the emergence of a global sports market could prompt a radical rethink by clubs. &apos;If Manchester United played in front of 70 million people [on TV or internet] on a global level, and each of them paid \u00a31, that&apos;s \u00a370m a game. It transforms the business.&apos; Domestic and Premier League rights are packaged up separately, but both are sold collectively, with the money shared between all 20 clubs. In the next deal, which will run from 2010 to 2013, Carling believes the bigger clubs may try to end this centralised arrangement for rights outside the UK. &apos;They will seek to do unilateral deals and it will change the model completely. The money will be astronomic.&apos; The prospect of the bigger clubs keeping their own broadband money, for example, is a frightening one for all the other clubs. Senior sources in the Premier League and throughout the game in England insist collective bargaining is here to stay, but there have been discussions about the value of rights sold overseas before, and Andy Melvin, deputy managing director of Sky Sports, concedes, &apos;Some clubs believe the international rights are undervalued because the Premier League is so sexy at the moment.&apos; There is no doubting the potential worldwide audience for games is enormous. When Everton and Manchester City both fielded Chinese players (City&apos;s Sun Jihai and Everton&apos;s Li Tie) in a game in January 2003, it was shown live on state television in China, billed as &apos;a Chinese Derby&apos;, and watched by an estimated audience of 350 million, despite a late-night finish. The average audience for a Premier League game screened on Sky Sports in Britain is 1.1m (excluding pub audiences), although subscribers pay about \u00a340 a month to watch. Games are screened in more than 200 countries worldwide. China&apos;s 1.1billion population earns an average annual wage of \u00a3500, but in 10 years&apos; time that figure could be 10 times higher. India already has an affluent middle class of 200 million and it is expected to grow to 500 million by 2015. These are markets no sport can afford to ignore. Uefa already &apos;simulcasts&apos; Champions League games over the internet in more than 200 countries, including China, and claims football is the number-one sport in the country, which is expected to overtake Germany as the world&apos;s third-largest economy within weeks. By 2009 China will be the biggest online market in the world. New technology is becoming more important in a TV industry that is going through a period of tumultuous change, with an explosion of channels in the UK and abroad. Twenty years ago there were four channels in Britain; now there are several hundred. Four out of every five British households have multichannel TV and the big channels are seeing their viewing figures tumble as competition increases. In 1995 more than 200 TV shows had audiences of over 15 million. Today there are barely any. All of which makes big sporting events that can guarantee huge audiences all the more appealing to broadcasters - one reason ITV paid a huge sum to screen last month&apos;s Rugby World Cup. A new wave of innovation in broadcasting will make games such as England v Sweden in last year&apos;s World Cup, which bagged an average audience of 18.8m for ITV, all the more valuable. Personal video recorders, such as Sky+, allow viewers to record shows, pause or fast forward, skip ads, or simply watch at a later date. TV schedules are becoming a thing of the past, creating a huge problem for advertisers who will no longer reach a captive audience of millions in front of the box. The implications for sport, because viewers want to watch it live, are very significant. Greg Dyke, the former director general of the BBC, says: &apos;The price broadcasters pay [for sports rights] will continue to go up. In a world where you can download anything, you can&apos;t download what&apos;s live.&apos; Roger Mosey, the BBC&apos;s head of sport, says. &apos;Drama, comedy or music can be time-shifted, but people want to watch news and sport live, so there&apos;s a big premium attached to them.&apos; The same applies to the value of rights on other platforms, including the internet and next-generation mobile phones. Mosey says that these new media are shaping the BBC&apos;s coverage of the Beijing Olympics. &apos;People will want it on mobile devices and broadband. Many of the events in next year&apos;s Olympics will be at 7pm, but in Britain it will be lunchtime. You may be at work or you may be on the beach.&apos; NBC plans to screen an extra 2,200 hours of Olympic coverage next year on-line and the BBC will show 2,400 hours of extra live sport on its interactive TV service, which allows viewers to choose which event to watch via their remote control, or online via a PC. &apos;At Beijing, when you wake up in the morning some events will have happened overnight and you&apos;ll want highlights before you go to work. So you do both,&apos; says Mosey. &apos;But by London 2012 the amount of coverage will be exponentially larger. The idea is to make more live coverage available than before - so you can see all the fencing live, for example. BBC1 will become the ultimate premium channel, giving you the gold-medal presentation in the javelin followed by the 100 metres, followed by cycling, but the aspiration is to show every event live.&apos; The Premier League already receives more than \u00a374m from the sale of mobile and internet clips, and a significant proportion comes from abroad. Malaysia is the largest overseas contributor, paying about \u00a35m. &apos;People who went to the World Cup in Japan and Korea saw fans travelling between games and using their phones to watch highlights,&apos; says Deloitte&apos;s Dan Jones. &apos;That will happen more and more with better resolution and bigger screens.&apos; Some newer innovations are mind-boggling. Uefa already use hi-tech gadgets to track every player in a Champions League game so they can produce statistics on how many yards they cover or tackles they make. Now Sony want to use that information to create a &apos;virtual&apos; version of the live game that will run alongside it, allowing viewers at home to pause matches and use their games consoles to become part of the action. &apos;If Wayne Rooney misses a shot you will be able to stop the game, take it yourself and see if you can do better,&apos; says Uefa&apos;s Daniel Marion. A survey carried out by Mindshare Performance, part of advertising giant WPP, recently found that, although Britons prefer to watch sport on TV at home or in the pub, most Chinese watch it on their computers and the majority of Indians prefer to use their mobile phones. That helps to explain why Nimbus Communications paid more than \u00a3300m for the four-year rights to Indian domestic cricket last year, a deal Daniel Taylor, a partner at OC&amp;C Consultants describes as: &apos;The first big-money sports rights deal outside Europe or North America. It was a massive increase on the last deal and way more than anyone expected.&apos; Next year&apos;s inaugural Singapore Grand Prix provides further evidence of a shift to new markets. Formula One has always been a trade-off between getting huge track fees in the Far East, where governments will pay up to \u00a315m for the right to stage a grand prix, or racing in the West where fees are not usually paid but TV companies pay many millions to screen races. &apos;The dynamics are changing,&apos; says Taylor. &apos;You used to go east for track fees or west for TV money: soon you will be able to go east and get both.&apos; Which could mean more floodlit races in future. Established Western sports are engaged in a global scramble to tap emerging markets and, not surprisingly, the Americans, who boast four of the six most affluent leagues (American football&apos;s NFL, Major League Baseball, ice hockey&apos;s NHL, and basketball&apos;s NBA) have led the way. Last week&apos;s game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants at Wembley was the first step towards establishing a global foothold, and the league&apos;s commissioner, Roger Goodell, has talked about basing a NFL team on another continent within 10 years, with at least four games a year being played outside the US before then. The NFL and other US leagues have already squeezed as much money as they can from their domestic market, and are being forced overseas to fund future growth, but they will face huge competition from other Western sports. According to Deloitte&apos;s Jones: &apos;India is cricket&apos;s market to lose, Japan loves baseball and Korea seems to have taken football to its heart. But China is much more interesting - it&apos;s up for grabs. Football&apos;s sort of getting there, basketball&apos;s big but only because China has got a few players in the NBA. They haven&apos;t found their sport yet in China, and every sport is looking at it.&apos; The demands of television have already fundamentally changed some sports. Hawkeye technology was introduced to tennis for viewers at home, but giving the players the right to challenge line calls has added drama and tension to the game. Athletics&apos; governing body, the IAAF, are considering changing the way they present the World Championships, perhaps in time for the 2011 event in South Korea. According to Emanuele Perotti Nigra, the IAAF&apos;s head of technology: &apos;Athletics is not easy to follow as a fan. There are so many events going on at the same time, so we need to focus attention on what you should be watching at any one time. We have to work with TV to do that. But it&apos;s quite sensitive.&apos; Despite the influx of TV money, football has remained essentially unchanged, which may help to explain its appeal. But the prospect of game times being changed, or even moving European matches to another continent, as raised in these pages last week, is sure to enrage fans, no matter how remote that prospect currently seems. The fan forums and internet sites in Florida have been awash with angry Dolphins fans complaining about last week&apos;s London showdown. &apos;People with common sense understand that we are consumers who have the right to get what we pay for,&apos; said one post, on a site calling for NFL commissioner Goodell to be removed from his job. &apos;Taxpayers have paid a premium to build most of these new stadiums and they expect the teams to play all their home games in the communities that support them.&apos; &apos;The NFL will be looking at the feedback very carefully,&apos; says Deloitte&apos;s Jones. &apos;It&apos;s a difficult balance because no sport wants to disenfranchise its fans.&apos; Just as the influx of TV money a generation ago was seized on by clubs, the opportunity of fresh riches abroad may prove too tempting to resist, according to Octagon&apos;s Carling, particularly at a time when many clubs feel their international rights are being sold too cheaply by the Premier League. He claims that if the big clubs retained those rights and sold them individually, &apos;the media rights would generate over 90 per cent of total income&apos;. Which would mean, he adds, &apos;They could afford to let fans in free, or reduce ticket prices significantly as it is important to have a full house to create the pictures.&apos; Berlusconi may be proved right for reasons even he would never have predicted."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/04/escape", "sentences": ["RANKING  1 Jet2.com (1)  2 KLM (7)  3 BMI (5)  4 Aer Lingus (2) 5 British Airways (4)  BEST LONG-HAUL AIRLINE Long-standing favourite Singapore Airlines remains in the top position, with Air New Zealand and Emirates taking second and third place respectively.", "RANKING  1 Singapore Airlines (1)  2 Air New Zealand (4)  3 Emirates (2)  4 Qatar Airways (-)  5 Virgin (3)  BEST BUSINESS AIRLINE This year&apos;s ranking is almost identical to last year&apos;s with Emirates coming out on top; the only difference is that Easyjet and Flybe have swapped places, with Flybe moving up to 8th."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-04T15:36:29Z", "title": "Your holiday winners", "tags": ["Travel", "Travel Awards 2007"], "article": "Our 2007 awards received a huge response from readers - 13,500 completed questionnaires, which were either filled in online, or cut out from the coupon printed in The Observer and the Guardian.

This conference, he says, is about trust., and what a meaty session it was too.

From quote fabrication and illegal phone tapping to the consumption of rodents by stand-up comics - this has all contributed to a erosion of trust.&quot; We can take it that Gavin O&apos;Reilly might have a thing or two to say about this, but Stewart said the internet is increasingly the pace where people to get a fair assessment of the facts, &quot;without editorialisation or opinion from reporters&quot;. Slightly odd, given that the web is often the platform that gives people that voice, but he later clarified that his point was about things being spun or not. &quot;A lot of the Daily Mail&apos;s editorial is not actually true&quot; The Daily Mail&apos;s executive managing editor Robin Esser wasted no time in enthusiastically laying into the internet, the whole thing, saying it&apos;s all unregulated and full of opinion. &quot;Just look at Wikipedia...&quot; but, as Morrissey would say, stop me if you&apos;ve heard this one before. Baroness Peta Buscombe Shami Charabarti, director of Liberty, said that talking about the internet as a good or bad thing is like talking about the sea as a good or bad thing. &quot;People will go to who they trust, and it&apos;s that need to have trust and mediation that will keep them coming back. It&apos;s the self-regulation of those voices that will keep people coming back and that&apos;s probably where the future of the industry lies.&quot; To which the deliciously well-spoken Sir Igor Judge, president of the Queen&apos;s Bench Division, said none of us has really has fully grasped the reality of what lies ahead. &quot;The Daily Mail often bites the hand that feeds it in terms of advertising,&quot; continued Baroness Buscombe. &quot;A lot of your editorial is not actually true but you have succeeded very often in diminishing the reputation of the advertising industry.&quot; Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace said newspapers are often lambasted for being last with the news, but that actually means they should be the most reliable source for facts. Shami Chakrabarti: &quot;Trust is in the eye of the beholder&quot; There&apos;s no crisis in British media, said Chakrabarti. &quot;If you don&apos;t believe me, go to Singapore where the front cover of the Straits Times will say &quot;&apos;Good governance is the key to prosperity&apos;.&quot; Liberty itself is a small organisation with very limited funding but, she said, without the platform of the media it is unlikely that many in the audience would have heard of it. Tony Blair&apos;s &apos;feral beasts of the media&apos; rant was ridiculous, she said. &quot;It seems trust is in the eye of the beholder and the wicked media is the one that&apos;s giving you the hardest time.&quot; &quot;I am both loved and loathed in different parts of the media and if the Sun newspaper wants to label me the most wicked woman in Britain then good, I say, because more people can sleep soundly in their beds at night.&quot; Sky: &quot;The BBC&apos;s arrogance tarnished us all&quot; Adam Boulton made an astonishing attack on the BBC, or maybe not that astonishing given that he&apos;s the political editor at Sky News. It&apos;s not an accident that the big media scandals have come out of the BBC, he said, and reeled off a slightly wobbly list of Hutton, premium phone lines (though the two biggest fines in that case were for ITV), Crowngate (which was produced by RDF) and Alan Yentob&apos;s noddies. &quot;I&apos;ve worked in the industry for 25 years and to say that it is common practice to drop in clips of yourself to imply you were taking the interview... well, I&apos;ve never come across it.&quot; &quot;The BBC tends to respond institutionally, and rather than look at specifics it will say &apos;we are under politcial attack&apos;. That arrogance tarnishes us all and gives impression not ready to put our house in order. We ought to think of the BBC as a news and entertainment organisation like anyone else, and expect same standards as anyone else.&quot; On top of that, he said interactivity is over-rated and that most comments are &quot;not worth the paper they aren&apos;t written on&quot;. &quot;The Reithian tradition of impartial media is one of the glories of the British media scene,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to be very careful about online, not that the numbers aren&apos;t showing that people won&apos;t consume that way, but because what we collectively offer online is our brand and reputation. People trust the professionals and the resources which we are prepared to put in gathering and processing that information.&quot; This could have run and run, but as very often at these things the most feisty lines of debate were terminated by our very efficient moderator, Alastair Stewart, and we moved on to a history of Which?.

This year, however, the coals-to-Newcastle cliche is moving from the exception to the rule. For decades, British food has been scorned by the superior gourmands of the world. But the reality is that food and drink exports from the UK are thriving, with a record \u00a311bn-worth of goods set to be sold abroad this year according to Food From Britain, an export marketing consultancy funded by the government and the food industry. British manufacturers, it turns out, have stumbled upon a new recipe to titillate foreign palates: mixing the historic appeal of classic products, such as whisky, with rebranded, upmarket versions of things that other countries should, by rights, make far more successfully. Posh chocolate We Brits may believe that Belgians are the ultimate purveyors of fine chocolate but increasingly, it seems, the Belgians believe that we are: exports of British chocolate to the country rose by 16% in the first half of this year. According to Chris Brockman of Food from Britain, there is a clear &quot;premium indulgence&quot; trend in the international food industry, and Britain is reaping the benefit chocolate-wise. The taste for upmarket and organic dark chocolate has been smartly exploited by nimble, fast-growing companies; Green &amp; Black&apos;s, for example, is now doing a roaring trade in North America. The biggest market for our chocolate is actually Ireland, but after that come France, Holland and Belgium - all nations who like to think they can teach us a thing or two about fine confectionery. Booze Beef may once have been the archetypal British food export but, appropriately enough for a nation of binge-drinkers, it is now very definitely booze. Astonishingly, whisky accounts for nearly a quarter of all our food and drink exports: the trade was worth \u00a31.1bn in the first six months of this year, a surge of 9% on the year before. Drinks manufacturers have been rubbing their hands with glee for a while now about the thirst for cheap British spirits in Asian markets such as Japan and South Korea. This thirst is most extraordinary in Singapore, where sales of whisky rose by 118% in the first half of this year. The Spanish also enjoy our gin, but the coals-to-Newcastle bit really comes in the burgeoning sales of ale to Ireland. Real ales from small breweries are doing particularly well (although the first-half-of-year sales of \u00a330m are still a drop in the ocean compared with the UK&apos;s consumption of Guinness). Tea Britain is no longer the greatest nation of tea drinkers (Ireland downs more, per head of population) but it still makes a cuppa of quid (sorry) selling classic brands such as Twinings and Tetley around the world. British Empire-era manufacturing thrived by taking the produce of one colony and selling it to another, and that is still the model for our tea industry today: while tentative tea-growing may be occurring in parts of Cornwall, almost all the tea we export is grown abroad and only blended, packaged and branded in this country. &quot;British&quot; tea is doing particularly well in Canada at the moment: it bought \u00a316.6m-worth of our dried leaves between January and June this year. Breakfast cereal Apart from a cup of black tea or a bowl of yoghurt and honey, the Greeks are not known for their breakfasts. But now, it seems, they have developed a hunger for a hearty British start to the day. Sales of UK cereals to Greece rose by 28% in the first half of this year, a statistic made only marginally less baffling when Brockman explains that it may in part be due to the number of British holidaymakers and expats demanding a bowl of milky cereal to scoff by the poolside every morning. Once again, our cleverly marketed premium brands seem to be slipping down foreigners&apos; throats particularly well - although just 27 years old, Dorset Cereals has sprung from nowhere to sell well in Europe in recent times. In China, Weetabix is popping up on the shelves of high-end &quot;western-style&quot; supermarkets, and is being bought by wealthy, westernised consumers. Cheese No word yet on the success of British clogs in Amsterdam, but cheddar cheese is certainly biting into those Dutch staples, gouda and edam. Sales of cheddar to Holland increased by 38% in the first half of this year. It is the &quot;extra mature&quot; cheddar market that is thriving and once again, the British appear to be masters of marketing it. &quot;The image and reputation of cheddar was destroyed a little bit because it could be made outside the UK and it has been seen as an &apos;ingredients cheese&apos;,&quot; says Brockman. &quot;Now producers are getting it back to being a quality farmhouse product - cheese you can put on your cheeseboard rather than just melting it on your toast.&quot; But it&apos;s not just cheddar that&apos;s doing well: stilton exports to France, for example, are up 37%. World foods The story of Patak&apos;s selling its pickles and sauces to the Indian subcontinent has already been told; but Patak&apos;s is just the tip of the iceberg: the UK&apos;s &quot;world food&quot; manufacturers are among the biggest and fastest growing exporters in the country. Traditionally the pattern is of immigrant communities first cooking their food for their own folk, then selling it to their host communities before exporting new hybrids (such as chicken tikka masala) to their countries of origin. But it has gone beyond that now. The Indian, Thai and Mexican food producer Noon, for example, has successfully introduced its chilled ready meals into Germany, while Geeta&apos;s sauces and pickles are also selling well there. &quot;Indian food in Germany is really going through quite a big boom,&quot; says Brockman - British Indian food, that is. Perhaps the most striking illustration of the weird world of Britain&apos;s global exports is the success of Britain&apos;s Discovery Foods, which sells Mexican sauces to Denmark and Sweden. (The Swedes, curiously enough, have the biggest appetite for Mexican food per head of population in Europe.) And the next big British food export success story? Probably Polish cuisine, according to Food From Britain. &quot;Polish food is quite big in UK supermarkets now but no one is seriously producing it in the UK yet,&quot; says Brockman. &quot;I can imagine in a few years time it could be being produced in the UK and in a decade&apos;s time we&apos;ll probably be exporting it as a British product.&quot; Word of Mouth More from Graham Holliday on our cereal exports on the food blog"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/therevolutionthatneverwas", "sentences": ["Kristen Silverberg, a senior state department official, this week urged Singapore to sever links between its banks and financial institutions and the Burmese junta.", "Although Singapore expressed &quot;revulsion&quot; at September&apos;s events, Ms Silverberg said &quot;outlawed&quot; regime figures continued to hold accounts there and used it as an offshore banking centre."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-06T19:00:00Z", "title": "The revolution that never was", "tags": ["David Miliband", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "Only six weeks after Burma&apos;s generals brutally suppressed pro-democracy protests, international outrage is fading, and with it political and diplomatic pressure for change. Campaigners say the unrelieved plight of the Burmese people is again in danger of being forgotten. In some ways, repression has actually grown worse. Theirs was the &quot;saffron revolution&quot; that never was. Western diplomats say widespread condemnation of the junta, and additional sanctions imposed by the US and EU, Australia and Japan, have had limited but measurable impact. After the violence, in which up to 200 people died and unknown thousands disappeared into the night, the UN security council formally took up Burma&apos;s case for the first time. It told the generals to stop killing and start a genuine national dialogue. The UN&apos;s envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, visiting the country this week, is expected to be allowed to meet Aung San Suu Kyi, the veteran pro-democracy leader held under house arrest, but not the General Than Shwe, the junta leader. The regime meanwhile has appointed a &quot;liaison officer&quot; and offered conditional talks with the opposition. Some political prisoners have been released. And a UN human rights rapporteur, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, is expected in Rangoon next week, in the first such visit for four years. Mr Pinheiro said today he would demand unfettered access to Burma&apos;s prisons and investigate how many people the security forces have killed. &quot;If they don&apos;t give me full cooperation, I&apos;ll go to the plane and I&apos;ll go out,&quot; he warned. His threat doubtless has the generals shaking in their jackboots. &quot;After 45 years of military government and several failed uprisings, it would be a little ambitious to think you can get instant results,&quot; said a senior British official. &quot;We&apos;re trying to use the genuine shock and horror [over September&apos;s bloodshed] to engage the neighbours in Asean [the Association of South-East Asian Nations] and China to get a political process and a genuine dialogue going that includes ethnic minority groups.&quot; The US has been more active than the EU. Kristen Silverberg, a senior state department official, this week urged Singapore to sever links between its banks and financial institutions and the Burmese junta. Although Singapore expressed &quot;revulsion&quot; at September&apos;s events, Ms Silverberg said &quot;outlawed&quot; regime figures continued to hold accounts there and used it as an offshore banking centre. &quot;We&apos;re asking institutions and governments worldwide to consider whether their relationships with Burma are helping facilitate this regime,&quot; she said. Despite these efforts, which they broadly applaud, activists say momentum has been lost as other crises, such Pakistan, claim precedence. Mark Farmaner, of Burma Campaign UK, said the junta was engaged in a familiar game: playing for time, making minimalist gestures that looked positive but signified little, and &quot;talking about talks&quot; rather than real reforms. &quot;People are still being arrested. The number of refugees is growing. Many people are still missing. Repression is at a higher level than it was before September.&quot; Despite talk of enhanced cooperation, the regime recently ordered the UN&apos;s permanent representative to leave the country. Its sole meeting so far with Ms Suu Kyi was, he said, devoid of any substance. Mr Farmaner said:  &quot;The Gambari mission will almost certainly fail. Pinheiro&apos;s visit hardly amounts to a breakthrough. We need a much higher level of engagement. Ban Ki-moon [the UN secretary-general] should go there in person. It should be made plain to the junta that what they got away with in the past is no longer acceptable. And we need to set deadlines and benchmarks to measure progress.&quot;  Diplomats say further action at the UN is being discussed in the event that Mr Gambari returns empty-handed. But that may be stymied by China and Russia. The EU may also move to implement a ban on new investment, previously agreed in principle. But it too is divided, with export-minded Germany and Italy among the most reluctant. There are also differences between the US and Britain over offering incentives to encourage the regime&apos;s cooperation, a course favoured by the foreign secretary, David Miliband. Burma was Mr Miliband&apos;s first big challenge in his new job, and he rose to it strongly. He energetically embraced the cause of reform and human rights - and threatened further measures if the junta did not cooperate. &quot;It is vital that international pressure on the Burmese regime is maintained,&quot; Mr Miliband said.

The end of the \u00a310.6bn bid for the supermarket group is not only a major upset for Qatari ambitions but could raise questions about the reliability of increasingly active sovereign funds from emerging nations such as Dubai and Singapore. Sovereign funds have been seen by some as the kind of strong and reliable long-term investors needed to add backbone to those parts of a wobbly stock market overdependent on less than transparent hedge funds and private equity firms. The Qataris themselves were keeping a low profile last night but sources familiar with the Qatar Investment Authority insisted it was right to back out of a deal that looked unattractive in current volatile market conditions. &quot;The QIA prides itself on being a disciplined and value-driven investor and that it why it felt unable to proceed at this time,&quot; said the source. Other supporters of the Qataris, who declined to be named, said the QIA, which backed the bid by Delta Two - its investment vehicle - and its head, Paul Taylor, should be praised for not paying over the odds just to save face. They said the QIA would remain a key investor in J Sainsbury and had shown itself to be the kind of shareholder welcomed at the London Stock Exchange, where it bought a 20% holding. But though no one would praise them for overpaying, some critics - and there are many - were questioning how such a long and tortuous run-up to the decision to pull out yesterday could have hinged on whether or not to pay out an extra \u00a3500m. Conspiracy theorists wonder whether the denouement revealed tensions inside Qatar while others wonder why the state-owned fund had got involved with such a relatively inexperienced operator as Mr Taylor and then gone for a trophy asset that would ensure any failure was blasted all over the world&apos;s media. Whatever the reason for abandoning a full takeover of Sainsbury&apos;s, the Qataris&apos; reputation has been badly bruised, leaving them looking like &quot;rookies&quot; in the words of the Financial Times.

They can be arranged into designs and fused when sprayed with water. Australian scientists say a chemical coating on the beads metabolises into gamma hydroxy butyrate - better known as GHB, or liquid ecstasy - , when ingested. GHB has become notorious in its use as a date rape drug, and is also popular on the dance club scene. When eaten, the compound - made from common and easily available ingredients - can induce euphoria, hallucinations and drowsiness in low doses. In higher doses, it can cause seizures, unconsciousness, coma and death. The toys were sent to a laboratory in Hong Kong for tests, a customs official said.

There was no immediate official response. The generals, who overturned the NLD&apos;s landslide election victory in 1990, have faced international condemnation and additional US and EU sanctions since a violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in September. Mr Gambari briefly met Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest and reportedly in deteriorating health, before heading for New York yesterday to report to the UN security council. He expressed optimism. &quot;We now have a process going which will lead to a dialogue between the government and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.

It may have a population of less than one million, but it has a proud, heroic history and a rich culture built up over centuries of diverse ethnic and colonial influences. The island attracted Chinese and Malay traders in the 15th century. The Portuguese arrived not long after, and stayed 400 years. Now it is attracting attention as an example of United Nations-led nation building. The UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), headed by Atul Khare, consists of a civilian staff of 1,568, of which 334 are volunteers, and a police commissioner, Rodolfo Tor, with 1,623 police personnel from 39 countries. UNMIT&apos;s main job is a difficult one: bringing about national reconciliation. While peaceful parliamentary elections were held on June 30, an atmosphere of apprehension has prevailed ever since. Neither the former ruling party, Fretilin, nor the newly formed CNRT, led by Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, the hero of the resistance to Indonesia&apos;s occupation, won an outright majority. At first, the UN, like many Timorese, including Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, the country&apos;s Nobel Laureate president who won election last May, had hoped that a national unity government could be formed. But a month-long attempt to broker an inclusive government failed. So, in August, Ramos-Horta ended the deadlock by swearing in Gusm\u00e3o, a longterm political ally and former president, as prime minister. Gusm\u00e3o had forged a coalition with three other centre-left parties. Together they won a narrow 51% majority of the popular vote, giving them 37 of the 65 seats in parliament. Gusm\u00e3o&apos;s main rival, Mari Alkatiri, Fretilin&apos;s leader and a former prime minister, denounced Ramos-Horta&apos;s decision. Fretilin, he said, would not cooperate with an &quot;illegal and unconstitutional&quot; government. The constitution is open to interpretation, and he argues that Fretilin, which won the largest share of the vote (29%), should have been asked first to form a government - even a minority one. Fretilin at first sought to fight the decision through non-violent means. But some of its supporters began venting their anger on the streets. Groups of angry marauding young men armed with stones and slingshots ran amok, setting up roadblocks and torching buildings. But this did not last long, thanks to both the UN and the democratic processes it is helping to nurture. Of course, Timor-Leste has been in something of a political limbo since last year, when clashes between rival factions in the security forces led to a brief breakdown of law and order. But with security now mainly in the hands of UN police and Australian and New Zealand peacekeepers, the political process is being given a chance to work itself out. Gusm\u00e3o will now need to prove himself at the head of an inexperienced government. One big test will be whether the estimated 100,000 displaced people, amounting to 10% of the population, many living in tent camps, feel safe enough to return home. If Fretilin persists in its decision to obstruct the government, instability will persist. This is where the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) can help. At the top of the agenda at Asean&apos;s leaders summit in Singapore this month is the adoption of a charter to embody its &quot;One Vision, One identity, One Community&quot; concept for Southeast Asia. Timor-Leste is still only an observer in the Asean family, but it appears able to grasp - far better than Burma, an Asean member state - the need for a rules-based Asean that stands for democratic governance even in the most difficult of circumstances. Indeed, the Timorese people have consistently shown that what they want from their government is openness, dialogue and majority voting under the rule of law. Burma&apos;s people want the same, but their country is being pushed towards collapse by years of political and economic crisis, and might well become Asean&apos;s pariah, like Africa&apos;s Zimbabwe. That should stand as a warning to Timor-Leste&apos;s clashing factions, lest any of them conclude that repression and dictatorship are the best solution.

Two dozen of them were moving, bow waves and wakes creasing the narrows between Hong Kong island and Kowloon: ferries, tugs, barges, and a couple of Star Line liners returning through the mist from the overnight casino cruises that allow passengers to gamble legally outside Hong Kong&apos;s territorial waters. More ships were at anchor, awaiting their place at the container wharves. Hong Kong is no longer the world&apos;s busiest port - that position is held by Singapore, and both ports will soon be overtaken by Shenzhen and Shanghai - but 500 ships still call here every week, mainly to load the machine-made products of Guangdong, the province in southern China that has become the factory to the world. A hundred years ago the Thames was as crowded and just as befogged: in Hong Kong, the carbon emissions from those Guangdong factories and power stations drift south and east, so that for nearly a fifth of the annual daylight hours one side of Hong Kong harbour, which takes seven minutes to cross by ferry, is invisible to the other. But it was not Conrad&apos;s river that I thought about when I glanced at the newspapers and studied the view. At breakfast I thought about Detroit. On Wednesday General Motors reported a loss of $39bn (\u00a319bn), among the biggest ever for a multinational company, while British Airways announced that after 50 years of service it would stop flying to the city that was once the automotive trade&apos;s world capital and the sixth (by some estimates, the fourth) largest city in the US. Ford is said to be on the verge of bankruptcy, more than 320,000 workers have lost their jobs in American vehicle and auto-parts manufacturing in the past seven years. Detroit is a ruin to equal Grozny or Machu Picchu. From the air, you see a huddle of old skyscrapers surrounded by many acres of scrubland where the inner suburbs once stood. On the ground, the streets of downtown Detroit - represented aerially by the huddle of skyscrapers - are almost empty of cars and people. The abandoned railroad terminus rises in six storeys from an open plain of vacant lots. When I went there three years ago to see Diego Rivera&apos;s famous murals of car-making in the Detroit Institute of Arts, an old man approached me on the gallery steps to ask where I was from, lone strangers being so unusual as to be welcomed. Exemplifying the change in the world&apos;s balance of power by contrasting the fortunes of Detroit and Hong Kong is too crude a trick. Still, reading reports from the western world in Hong Kong is rather like hearing about a bitter winter from the vantage point of a warm spring. This week Alibaba.com, a website connecting China&apos;s entrepreneurs to buyers and sellers in the rest of the world, raised $1.5bn in its first public offering on the Hong Kong exchange, while, thanks to feverish share-buying in Shanghai, the worth of PetroChina rose to more than a trillion dollars, the highest market capitalisation of any company in history. General Motors&apos; loss equalled Bulgaria&apos;s gross domestic product; PetroChina&apos;s market value briefly (the shares went down) equalled the worth of all shares tradeable on the Russian stock exchange. The soundtrack to the harbour view is the noise of tower blocks being built, often on land reclaimed from the sea. The harbour has shrunk and goes on shrinking, and Hong Kong has exported most of its factories to Guangdong. What Hong Kong does more than ever is money. Turn away from the harbour and towards Hong Kong island&apos;s high ridge: the power of money rises vertically in tower after tower, sometimes topped off, retro-style, in simple versions of the Chrysler or Empire State buildings. Lost at the feet of these money towers is a domed building from the British era, passed on the street beside it by double-deck trams of the same vintage. This is the chamber of Hong Kong&apos;s legislative council, which Chris Patten did his best to democratise in his time as the colony&apos;s last governor. Ten years ago, the fear was that Beijing would trample all over it. In fact, the handover&apos;s &quot;one country, two systems&quot; solution has persisted. A proportion of the council is directly elected by public vote and Beijing has promised that the chief executive will be elected by universal suffrage from 2012. How strong, meanwhile, is the demand for democracy or the perception of Beijing oppression? A council by-election is scheduled to take place on December 2 and on Thursday I went to an election meeting at Hong Kong University&apos;s main hall. Eight candidates sat in a line across the stage, but only two of them really mattered. This is a contest between two women, Anson Chan and Regina Ip, both of them former senior civil servants in the British colonial administration (Chan was Patten&apos;s chief secretary). They represent the argument between &quot;democracy&quot; (Chan) and &quot;good governance&quot; (Ip), which is to say between government by the popular Hong Kong vote and government according to the wishes of the Communist leadership in Beijing. Ip is seen as Beijing&apos;s placewoman; Chan is the socially grander of the two and tried to have the meeting conducted in English rather than Cantonese. The hall was packed with students and television crews. The sparring between the two women was often applauded, though the level of discourse would strike anyone from Britain or the US as polite and brief. And it may be a mark of the absence of open argument in Hong Kong that the next day&apos;s front page headline in the South China Morning Post ran &quot;Ip, Chan go head to head in rough-and-tumble debate&quot;. Opinion polls have Chan and Ip running neck-and-neck, which suggests that &quot;democracy&quot; (and therefore Beijing disapproval) is not a popular cause. There may be historical reasons for that. Christine Loh, who runs Civic Exchange, a thinktank that produces lively insights and information on Hong Kong&apos;s politics and environment, says that a characteristic of former colonies is that they&apos;re accustomed to the idea that policy is decided elsewhere. &quot;Our bureaucratic structures are there to implement rather than make policy. We&apos;re used to commenting on policy, even criticizing policy, but we don&apos;t have a tradition of competing ideas.&apos; But the larger reason for content is surely money. By no means is everyone rich in Hong Kong. Nearly half of the population lives in public housing, and the people who shop in the many outlets of Armani, Vuitton and Marc Jacobs have often crossed from mainland China and places such as Dongguan, where this week Tony Blair was paid his $500,000 for speechifying at a new development of luxury villas. (Bill Clinton got only half that for a speech in Shenzhen five years ago: the &quot;progress of capitalism&quot; marches on in China and no mistake.) Every Hong Kong citizen, however, shares standards of public transport, schools, hospitals and general civic efficiency that would be unusual in mainland China. How does the government raise the money? Not from income tax with a marginal rate set to fall from 16% to 15%. The answer is land. Turn away from the sea view again and look down from another window at the white-painted cathedral of St John&apos;s. It sits on the only freehold plot in Hong Kong. The Crown claimed the rest of the colony, and now the government of the Special Administrative Region owns it, taking great dollops of leasehold rent and premiums from developers. Land is to Hong Kong what oil is to a Gulf state, which is why piles are being driven into the seashore and so much of the harbour has vanished. The revenues have sustained a long outbreak of peace."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/10/classicalmusicandopera3", "sentences": ["A co-production between the T&apos;ang Quartet and Glasgow-based Theatre Cryptic, Optical Identity was commissioned by the 2007 Singapore arts festival and subsequently performed at this year&apos;s Edinburgh festival.", "In recent weeks, the Singapore-based T&apos;ang Quartet has returned to Scotland to tour the production, taking in some unlikely venues in isolated communities."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-10T23:47:49Z", "title": "Optical Identity New Athenaeum Theatre, Glasgow", "tags": ["Music", "Classical music", "Culture"], "article": "A co-production between the T&apos;ang Quartet and Glasgow-based Theatre Cryptic, Optical Identity was commissioned by the 2007 Singapore arts festival and subsequently performed at this year&apos;s Edinburgh festival.

Theatre Cryptic artistic director Cathie Boyd&apos;s experiments with the visual presentation of music mean that this production is as far from a conventional string quartet concert as you can probably get. A common flaw of many of Boyd&apos;s Cryptic projects has been that the music hasn&apos;t been good enough to merit having such extraordinary attention lavished on it or to make the video projections, sophisticated lighting and theatrical elements of the production cohere into something meaningful. Optical Identity&apos;s repertoire is stronger than most: it opens with a fairly classic contemporary quartet work, Kevin Volans&apos;s minimalist White Man Sleeps, and proceeds via contrasts: Rolf Wallin&apos;s punchy Phonotope I for quartet and electronics; the mesmerising eastern exoticism of Franghiz Ali-Zadeh&apos;s Mugam Sayagi and Joby Talbot&apos;s playful Manual Override. Boyd brings to this her customary treatment of dramatic lighting effects and screen projections, with the T&apos;ang Quartet&apos;s members - who have committed most of the programme to memory - moving around the stage space as they perform. The effect is somewhat akin to a high-budget rock concert. It&apos;s not an approach that would work with anything but the most contemporary end of the quartet repertoire, just as it isn&apos;t every string quartet you would want to see in the T&apos;ang Quartet&apos;s midriff-baring structural white outfits.

It kind of really helped me to relax.&apos; Fisher said the easy camaraderie convinced him of something. &apos;I&apos;m good enough to be out here with these guys, so why not try to show them how good I am.&apos; Paul Casey is confident his strong showing so far is the start of better things to come - starting with the \u00a3400,000 on offer should the Ryder Cup winner overhaul Phil Mickelson&apos;s three-shot lead in today&apos;s final round. Casey began his 2007 campaign with a one-stroke victory at January&apos;s Abu Dhabi Golf Championship but was left disappointed with his overall year after finishing 13th on the European Tour&apos;s Order of Merit. But he is now confident of making his mark in 2008, starting with victory today, which would set him up for another tilt at the Order of Merit crown which narrowly eluded him in 2006. &apos;The win early in 2007 in Abu Dhabi was great, but after that it did go a bit flat,&apos; he said. &apos;I had some tremendous rounds of golf throughout the year but I didn&apos;t manage to put four rounds together as the season went on, which was disappointing. However, I really feel like I have grown as a player. I&apos;m working better with the swing, I am a lot more focused and I&apos;m working very hard in the gym. I&apos;m just waiting for it to click and hopefully the corner has been turned and this is the indication of the golf that is going to come in the next few months and years.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/11/golf", "sentences": ["You just never know what&apos;s going to happen.&quot; Mickelson was playing in his second consecutive tournament in Asia following last weekend&apos;s Singapore Open, and he has spent some of the trip sightseeing with his wife Amy and their children Amanda, Sophia and Evan, who were all at the Sheshan International Golf Club to enjoy his victory."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-11T14:33:08Z", "title": "Golf: Mickelson beats English pair in Shanghai play-off", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Phil Mickelson beat England&apos;s Lee Westwood and Ross Fisher in a three-way play-off to win the HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai.

If by some whirl of insanity, such as holiday or hospitalisation, my telly remains off for a few days, then it&apos;s virtually a case of performing the dance of the seven veils to get it even to splutter out a meagre episode of Coronation Street once more.

Cue much swearing, the prospect of a night alone with the radio and a terrifying process called re-scanning. Until recently, though, having to submit myself to trial by technology was all worth it because of what happened at 9pm. You tell me if you can think of a better way to spend two hours than by first immersing yourself in an episode of Tenko and then following it up with a slice of The World at War, both courtesy of UKTV History. I might add, for those inclined to dismiss the former as a piece of Eighties melodrama, that Joan Didion has written most eloquently in its favour, so it&apos;s virtually compulsory for all intellectuals of an iconoclastic bent. But perhaps what was so particularly brilliant about this arrangement was its constancy: Tenko goes on almost as long as the war did itself, after all, so you knew what you might be doing of an evening for a good long while. And, let&apos;s face it, if you happened to be going out (and, naturally, I wouldn&apos;t tempt fate by meddling with the video recorder), you could pretty much pick up where you left off, in both instances. And then one day, lamps lit, cushions plumped, glass of wine poured and TV supper (a bacon sandwich, obviously, for it was the days before a single morsel had been proven to send you to an early grave) to the ready, I switched on only to be confronted by Ray Mears or Jeremy Clarkson or Stephen Fry, or some guy or other who, I later discovered, was one of the faces of Dave, a new station dedicated to what they call &apos;witty banter&apos;, a phrase guaranteed to kill stone-dead any hint of that other appalling word, bonhomie. Of Sister Ulrica, Lieutenant Sato and Dr Beatrice Mason there was no sign; of Phill Jupitus there was plenty. I am now lost in a world of digital confusion, made all the worse by &apos;simple&apos; instructions, all of which have the dread word re-scanning at their centre and even invoke such phenomena as bad weather to explain why an unalloyed viewing pleasure has been turned into something that urges you out on a cold winter night: &apos;If you can see Dave on channel 19 and UKTV History on 12 until 6pm, but only juggling reindeers thereafter, then press Menu and select Retune&apos; - that sort of nonsense.

As I limped out of the drab dog&apos;s bed in which I was expected to sleep for the next 30 wankless nights, I observed the previous incumbent had left a thread of dental floss by the pillow - most likely as a noose for his poor, famished dinkle. When I&apos;d arrived the day before, the counsellors had taken away my copy of the Guardian, as there was a depiction of the Venus de Milo in the arts section, but let me keep the Sun, which obviously had a page 3 lovely. What kind of pervert police force censors a truncated sculpture but lets Keeley Hazell pass without question? &quot;Blimey, this devious swine&apos;s got a picture of a concrete bird with no arms - hanging&apos;s too good for him!&quot; If they were to censor London town, they would ignore Soho but think that the statue of Alison Lapper in Trafalgar Square had been commissioned by Caligula. Being all holed up in the aptly named KeyStone clinic (while the facility did not have its own uniformed police force, the suggestion of bungling silent film cops is appropriate) was an all too familiar drag. Not that I&apos;d ever been incarcerated in sex chokey before, Lord no, but it was the umpteenth time that I&apos;d been confronted with the galling reality that there are things over which I have no control and people who can force their will upon you. Teachers, sex police, actual police, drug counsellors: people who can make you sit in a drugless, sexless cell either real or metaphorical and ponder the actuality of life&apos;s solitary essence. In the end it&apos;s just you. Alone. The necessity for harsh self-assessment wasn&apos;t the only thing I hated about that KeyStone place. No, that vied for supremacy with multitudinous bastard truths. I hated my bed: the mattress was sponge, and you had to stretch your own sheet over this miserable little single divan in the corner of the room. And I hated the room itself where the strangled urges of onanism clung to the walls like mildew. I particularly hated the American grey squirrels that were running around outside - just free, like idiots, giggling and touching each other in the early spring sunshine. The triumph of these little divs over our noble red British squirrel had become a searing metaphor for my own subjugation at the hands of the anti-fuck Yanks. To make my surrender to conformity more official, I had been obliged to sign a contract promising that I would refrain from masturbation, porn, &quot;seductive behaviour&quot; and &quot;sexual contact with another person&quot;. I should have been photographed signing it, like when a footballer joins a new team. Sex is recreational for me, as well as a way of accruing status and validation (even before I attained the unique accolade of &quot;Shagger of the Year&quot; from the Sun. We all need something to help us unwind at the end of the day. You might have a glass of wine, or a joint, or a big delicious blob of heroin to silence your silly brainbox of its witterings, but there has to be some form of punctuation, or life just seems utterly relentless. And this is what sex provides for me - a breathing space, when you&apos;re outside of yourself and your own head. Especially in the actual moment of climax, where you literally go, &quot;Ah, there&apos;s that, then. I&apos;ve unwound. I&apos;ve let go.&quot; Not without good reason do the French describe an orgasm as a &quot;little death&quot;. That&apos;s exactly what it is for me (in a good way, obviously) - a little moment away, a holiday from my head. So why would a fella who plainly enjoys how&apos;s yer father as much as I do go to a so-called &quot;sex camp&quot;? Many people are sceptical about the idea of what I like to call &quot;sexy addiction&quot;, thinking it a spurious notion, invented primarily to help Hollywood film stars evade responsibility for their priapic excesses. But I reckon there is such a thing. Addiction, by definition, is a compulsive behaviour that you cannot control or relinquish, in spite of its destructive consequences. And if my life proves nothing else, it demonstrates that this formula can be applied to sex just as easily as it can be to drugs or alcohol, both of which I know more than a bit about. At one point, about five years ago, I had a harem of about 10 women, whom I would rotate in addition to one-night stands and random casual encounters. But shagging - incessant as it was - no longer seemed to have the required calming effect. I was on the brink of becoming sufficiently well known for my carnal overindulgences - with lapdancers and prostitutes, to say nothing of all the women who didn&apos;t sell sex for a living - to cause me professional difficulties. There&apos;s nothing especially peculiar or odd about my erotic predilections. It&apos;s the scale of my sexual endeavours that causes the problems, not the nature of them. I just like girls, all different ones, in an unsophisticated, unevolved way, like a Sun reader or a yobbo at a bus stop in Basildon, perhaps because, at my core, that&apos;s what I am. I&apos;m a bloke from Grays with a good job and a terrific haircut who&apos;s been given a Wonka ticket to a lovely sex factory &apos;cos of the ol&apos; fame, and while Augustus Gloop drowns and Veruca Salt goes blue, I&apos;m cleaning up, I&apos;m rinsin&apos; it baby! I haven&apos;t always treated women well - more than one relationship has collapsed because of my infidelity - but to this day I feel a fierce warmth for women who have the same disregard for the social conventions of sexual protocol as I do. I love it when I meet a woman and her sexuality is dancing across her face, so it&apos;s apparent that all we need to do is nod and find a cupboard. My manager, John Noel - think of a big, kind, lovely, vicious bastard, like a Darth Vader from Manchester running a school for disadvantaged children - who had previously successfully forced me into drug rehabilitation, thought a little stretch in winky-nick would do me the power of good, and used threats, bullying, love and blackmail to make me go. I eventually agreed for the same reason that I had given up drink and drugs - because my ambition is the most powerful force within me. While some celebrities have &quot;yes men&quot; surrounding them, I have &quot;fuck-off&quot; men. And so John spitefully decided not to send me to some sort of celebrity treatment centre, like the world-renowned Meadows Clinic in Arizona, but a facility where not all the places were private, where a certain proportion of people were there on judicial programmes - &quot;jail-swerves&quot;, they call them, when you&apos;re a drug addict and you&apos;re offered a choice of prison or rehab. The same option exists for the terminally saucy - get treatment or go to prison; in prison there&apos;ll be much more sex but it could err on the side of coercive. I had no idea of what to expect when I arrived at KeyStone, although I&apos;d spoken to one of the counsellors several times on the phone - the reassuringly named Travis Flowers. I told Travis about the lack of control I was exercising over who I was having sex with. I was pursuing hanky-panky like it was a job, like there was a league table that I had to be at the summit of. And as I explained how I toiled each day with the diligence of Bobby Moore and the grit of Julian Dicks, humming slave songs to keep my spirits up, Travis reassured me that I was just the sort of person who needed KeyStone&apos;s help. The clinic was in the middle of this square in some quiet Philadelphia suburb. The house looked like a normal American family home does - you know, where they&apos;ve got the sloping roof to the porch bit and gardens around it, a bit like where the Waltons lived, all pastoral and sweet, but with John-Boy chained up in the mop cupboard scrabbling around trying to fiddle with his goolies through a mask of tears. Over the road there was a church: a modern grey building, which constantly played a recording of church bells. Strange it was. Why no proper bells? I never went in but I bet it was a robot church for androids, where the Bible was in binary and their Jesus had laser eyes and metal claws. I was greeted on the steps of the clinic by one of the counsellors. I can&apos;t remember her name, but she was wearing a T-shirt with frogs on. It turned out she was obsessed with &apos;em, and when I asked her why she said, &quot;When I was a kid, there was a pond near my house which all the frogs would try to get back to, and they&apos;d get killed crossing over the road, so I used to try and help them across.&quot; &quot;Fucking hell,&quot; I thought. &quot;D&apos;ya wanna have a clearer analogy etched on your T-shirt? How troublingly apposite that your mission in life should now be to save people from destruction as they pursue their natural instinct to spawn.&quot; At this point, the frog-lady introduced me to a subdued and pinch-faced individual. &quot;Arthur will show you around,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;He&apos;s gonna be your roommate.&quot; (In the film, Arthur would be played by Rick Moranis or William H Macy.) Arthur showed me round the kitchen with its horrible meaty American meals. Meals which I, as a vegetarian, couldn&apos;t eat, so I would have to live on fruit for the month, like a little ape. One by one, I began to meet more of my fellow clients, or patients, or inmates, or perverts - whatever you want to call them, including an intimidating Puerto Rican cove who looked like a hybrid of Colin Farrell&apos;s &quot;Bullseye&quot; character from the film Daredevil and Bill Sykes&apos;s dog in Oliver Twist (whose name was also Bullseye, strangely enough), who kept calling me &quot;London&quot; - &quot;Hey, London!&quot; I resented being called &quot;London&quot;. There are eight million people living in London, and my identity, I hope, is quite specific. He addressed me the same way he would&apos;ve Ken Livingstone or Danny Baker - God knows what they&apos;d be doing there. I&apos;m not even from London; I&apos;m from Essex. (Though I suppose &quot;Essex&quot; would have been even less appropriate - it has, after all, got the three letters &quot;s-e-x&quot; in it and that&apos;s what caused all this bother.) This demeaning and geographically inaccurate mode of address was just one aspect of what soon began to seem like a concerted campaign to dismantle every element of my persona. It was not just my copy of the Guardian that had been confiscated on my arrival, but also my Richard Pryor CDs and my William Burroughs novel. And I&apos;d not been at KeyStone long before my attire began to attract complaints. Apparently, the way my excess belt hung in front of my crotch was confusing and enticing to the pervert fraternity as it suggested a phallus. So they censored me. I was like Elvis &quot;the Pelvis&quot; Presley on Ed Sullivan, I tells ya, punished for the crime of being sexy. As the days went on, I started to learn why other people were in there. I found out that Arthur was a paedophile who had eloped with his 13-year-old foster daughter. If he went back to Arizona to face the charges, he&apos;d be in line for either lifetime imprisonment or execution. Peter, a well groomed, silver-bearded Christopher Lee figure, had had sex with his wife&apos;s sister when she was 12. These revelations came as a bit of a blow and made me question the rationale of the whole dashed trip. &quot;OK,&quot; I thought, &quot;I&apos;ve a bit of an eye for the ladies, now as a kind of punishment I&apos;m rooming with a paedophile. Is that gonna be helpful?&quot; Like them lads that get sent down for nicking a car radio and end up sharing a cell with a diligent bank robber mentor who schools them in criminality. I went down to the office and started making frantic phone-calls home, saying, &quot;Get me out of this place.&quot; If I&apos;d been less terrified I might&apos;ve paused to dream up a new reality show format, I&apos;m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of This Demented Sex Centre&quot;, where minor faces off the box are forced to doss down with, say, Peter Sutcliffe for the amusement of an apathetic nation. John was on holiday, and no one I spoke to was prepared to sanction my departure so, out of fear, desperation and a kind of morbid curiosity, I decided to stay. It&apos;s extraordinary how quickly you get institutionalised in that kind of environment. You start wearing, not pyjamas exactly, as you do get dressed, but certainly indoorsy sorts of clothes. They have meetings every morning and afternoon. The rituals are astonishing. You have to go round the room introducing yourself - &quot;Hello, I&apos;m Russell&quot; - and then admitting to your recent transgressions. These aren&apos;t really wrongdoings as we would normally understand them, more everyday actions that have developed a sexual component: &quot;I had an erotic thought&quot;; &quot;I experienced eroticised rage&quot;; or &quot;I did some eroticised humour&quot;. Then you&apos;d round the whole thing off by saying, &quot;My goal for today is to get through the KeyStone experience and just live it as best I can.&quot; People began to customise this closing declaration, I suppose as a way of emphasising their own particular characters. But far from lessening the institutional feel of the whole proceedings, it kind of exacerbated it. Soon enough, each person seemed to have their own slogan: &quot;Hello, I&apos;m Stuart, and I&apos;m gonna swim like a KeyStone dolphin.&quot; These customised slogans would often be drawn from the totemic cuddly toy that we were each obliged to select from the mantelpiece. I had a camel. Or someone else would say, &quot;I&apos;m gonna ride the KeyStone Express,&quot; and all the others would make supportive train-noises - &quot;Wooh! Wooh!&quot; And I&apos;d be sat there in the middle thinking, &quot;Oh great, I&apos;m in a nuthouse.&quot; In that situation, however, alienated from my normal surroundings, I realised that the outer surface of what I thought was my unique, individual identity was just a set of routines. We all have an essential self, but if you spend every day chopping up meat on a slab, and selling it by the pound, soon you&apos;ll find you&apos;ve become a butcher. And if you don&apos;t want to become a butcher (and why would you?), you&apos;re going to have to cut right through to the bare bones of your own character in the hope of finding out who you really are. Which bloody hurts. Perhaps you&apos;re wondering what formulated my peculiar sexuality? It ain&apos;t that peculiar. I&apos;m a bloke from Essex who likes birds with big bottoms and big boobs, lovely dolly birds. I don&apos;t mean to be dismissive - they might be incredibly dark, fretful Sylvia Plath-style heroines for all I know - but if they are, I&apos;d rather not find out because life&apos;s difficult enough. The episode that defined my relations with women - and with myself - occurred in Hong Kong with my dad. I was 17. His third marriage had just broken up, so he needed someone to go on holiday with. I was unemployed, penniless, birdless and desperate for his approval; we were the perfect holiday companions. On the plane home he said, &quot;I went away with a boy and came back with a man.&quot; Both of those people were me, so what happened to induce such a significant transition? In addition to Hong Kong we visited Bali, Singapore and Thailand, and in all those places we saw incredible things. There was only one sight I was interested in seeing. Or rather one thing I was inerested in doing, repeatedly. One thing that chewed its way into my barren little soul and gave me, at long last, a physical pursuit that I was good at. Sex. Disposable sex, sex as leisure, sex for pleasure, sex you sordid little treasure, drag me from monotony and give me kicks too hot to measure. On day one in Hong Kong we went to some sleazy dive hidden behind a thick black drape where women from the east traipsed louchely along the mirrored promenade in garish beachwear. That promenade was a conveyor belt from which produce could be selected; I didn&apos;t know that then but my cock did, twitching, preparing frantically, trying to recall correct procedure. &quot;This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill.&quot; My dad sat there next to me, familiar with this glistening and foreign terrain. I didn&apos;t understand what I was witnessing, but by jingo, I knew I liked it. Dumbstruck, I sat looking at the women, their hair, each strand identifiable as it responded to a fan that had been placed there to elicit exactly the reaction I felt in my pantaloons, their toenails, painted and perfect, each solitary toe a match for me. They didn&apos;t seem enslaved or exploited - to me they weren&apos;t; they were mistresses, goddesses, salvation. &quot;I can&apos;t wait to tell my mates that I saw these women in swimsuits,&quot; I said to myself. Before long, I was sat on a barstool with a Filipino girl called Mary-Lou, or something similarly unlikely. I thought, &quot;I can&apos;t wait to tell my mates I was sat talking to Mary-Lou.&quot; That quickly became, &quot;I can&apos;t wait to tell my mates I was kissing her.&quot; Then we were leaving, a street, a cab, perfume, hairspray, the three Asian prostitutes that my dad was drunkenly herding - Mary-Lou, another girl and the madam of the club, who had come along just for sport (when I learned that she&apos;d come along without payment, I thought that a testimony to my dad&apos;s powers). Back at our hotel room, my dad set about unwrapping his two prostitutes, like pass-the-parcel where the music never stopped, and I sat nervously on the edge of the other twin bed with Mary-Lou, kissing her and thinking she was beautiful and falling in love. I&apos;d only had anything close to sex once before - a week before my 16th birthday. I&apos;d been careful to cultivate an image of myself as an aristocratic sex-pert, but she must have known I was a virgin as soon as the bungling encounter commenced. In Hong Kong, I was naked and shy about my body. I had trouble getting hard, and the blow job seemed daft, not sexual, just giggly and intrusive. After the un-sex, I carried Mary-Lou in my weedy arms out on to the balcony to look at the view of a great, looming skyscraper, disapprovingly observing. Mary-Lou didn&apos;t make me feel embarrassed, and was incredibly romantic really, given the context. I stroked Mary-Lou&apos;s hair and kissed her cheek and traced my finger down her perfect nose, scored by the cacophony from the adjacent bedlam, &quot;Yeah, come on!&quot; and &quot;Phwooar, you&apos;re juicy!&quot; As she was about to go, she said expertly, &quot;Russell, I must leave now before I fall in love with you.&quot; My heart skipped, and I heard, &quot;Oh, fucking hell, I&apos;m gonna be sick&quot; - a disapproving announcement from dear old Ron. The next morning, my dad, concealed behind a newspaper, folded down the top right-hand corner. &quot;Did you wear a condom with that bird last night?&quot; &quot;Oh, no I didn&apos;t, Dad.&quot; He sniffed, &quot;You should&apos;ve.&quot; Then the corner of the page flicked up once again, and he was gone. In the course of the rest of that holiday, I had sex with loads more prostitutes; always got a hard on, never wore a condom, and never fell in love. In Bangkok, when bar girls in Patpong left their posts to follow me down the street, cooing and touching my hair, I felt that I had my dad&apos;s unequivocal approval. When I came back from Asia, I was much more comfortable around women, and my sexuality had morphed forever from bewildered innocence into something more complex and rapacious. Once my career as a comedian and TV presenter started to pick up, I began to have loads of encounters after gigs. As my sexual appetite grew, I found myself engaged in an increasingly desperate quest to satisfy it. I became so open to suggestion that when someone asked me if I&apos;d like to go to an orgy, I didn&apos;t think twice before accepting this invitation. The word &quot;orgy&quot; is undeniably an evocative one. It conjures up sumptuous images of delicate muslin drapes being teased by a breeze, Turkish music playing everywhere (in fact my whole orgy scenario seems to have been lifted pretty much wholesale from a Turkish Delight advert), nubile Nubian women entwined about each other like a Henry Moore statue, people decadently devouring grapes. I thought there&apos;d probably be a sort of Swiss bloke with no irises or pupils in his eyes as well, just kind of staring. But what I got in a tower block in Hackney was people who looked like they were made out of Ready Brek, swathed in clingfilm, waddling back and forth with towels about their waists. And everywhere there was this intangible sadness, as if the orgy was being directed by Mike Leigh. I remember this woman came bustling out of a doorway when I first got there - she reminded me of my mum, which didn&apos;t help - and said, &quot;Just done my second . . . better go and rinse my mouth out.&quot; Then a washing-machine repair man turned up - not as a guest, but to repair the washing-machine.

Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who topped the Forbes Arabia rich list last year, has invested a small piece of his estimated $20.3bn (\u00a39.8bn) fortune in an Airbus &quot;Flying Palace&quot;, which is priced out of most tycoons&apos; range with a retail price of $310m.  Airline customers for the mega-jet, which can seat up to 850 people, have managed to win sizeable discounts by placing bulk orders but the Riyadh-based billionaire is expected to have paid the full price - before adding the multimillion pound cost of kitting out the airliner. The passenger version of the A380 has already raised the bar in luxurious air travel, with inaugural customer Singapore Airlines fitting its business class section with double-bed cabins.  However, private buyers will have much more leeway to indulge their whims, because the lack of hundreds of economy class seats leaves ample room for a kitchen, boardroom, cocktail bar, gymnasium, jacuzzi and giant plasma TV screens. Virgin Atlantic, one of the biggest investors in innovative airline products and a prospective A380 buyer, has considered installing a swimming pool and creche in its planes. Prince Alwaleed signed the sale agreement for the A380 in a ceremony at the Dubai Airshow today. David Velupillai, marketing director at Airbus executive aviation, said there were 25 VIP Boeing 747s in service and at least five more orders for large VIP planes are expected over the next few years. He added that the plane will be delivered around 2010 and will take about two years to fit. Asked if the prince had chosen the layout of his new jet, Velupillai said his customer had &quot;not decided yet&quot;. He said: &quot;In general terms, the VIP A380s will have lots of bedrooms, plus lounges where up to 20 people can be seated.&quot;  Velupillai added that the A380 gave Prince Alwaleed considerably more room than his smaller 747-400. &quot;He will get 50% more floor space.

But, as the millennium approached, many societies questioned whether killing their citizens through the judicial system served a positive purpose. I am delighted that the death penalty is being removed from the globe. To a Christian whose belief system is rooted in forgiveness, the death penalty is unacceptable. Either in law or in practice, 130 countries have now abolished the death penalty. And since 1990, 50 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Last year only 25 countries carried out executions. So strong is the global sentiment against the death penalty - with some notable exceptions, such as the United States, China and Singapore - that a resolution calling for a moratorium on executions and the abolition of capital punishment is scheduled to go before the United Nations general assembly tomorrow. The world community will decide its view on the morality of capital punishment. I have experienced the horror of being close to an execution. Not only during the apartheid era of South Africa, when the country had one of the highest execution rates in the world, but in other countries as well. And I have witnessed the victims of the death penalty the authorities never speak of - the families of those put to death. I remember the parents of Napoleon Beazley, a young African-American man put to death in Texas after a trial tainted by racism. Their pain was evident as the killing of their son by the state to which they paid taxes approached. I can only imagine the unbearable emotional pain they went through as they said their final goodbye to their son on the day of his execution. It is often asked by those favouring the death penalty: &quot;What if your child was murdered?&quot; And it is a natural question. Rage is a common reaction to the homicide of a loved one, and a wish for revenge is understandable. But what if the person condemned to death was your son? No one raises a child to be a murderer, yet many parents suffer the grief of knowing their child is to be killed. In 1988, the parents of those on death row in South Africa wrote to the president, saying: &quot;To be a mother or father and watch your child going through this living hell is a torment more painful than anyone can imagine.&quot; We must not put these children to death. It is to inflict horrific and unacceptable suffering upon them, and their mothers and fathers. Retribution, resentment and revenge have left us with a world soaked in the blood of far too many of our sisters and brothers. The death penalty is part of that process. It says that to kill in certain circumstances is acceptable, and encourages the doctrine of revenge. If we are to break these cycles, we must remove government-sanctioned violence. The time has come to abolish the death penalty worldwide. The case for abolition becomes more compelling with each passing year. Everywhere experience shows us that executions brutalise both those involved in the process and the society that carries them out. Nowhere has it been shown that the death penalty reduces crime or political violence. In country after country, it is used disproportionately against the poor or against racial or ethnic minorities. It is often used as a tool of political repression. It is imposed and inflicted arbitrarily. It is an irrevocable punishment, resulting inevitably in the execution of people innocent of any crime. It is a violation of fundamental human rights. \u00b7 Desmond Tutu is a former archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel peace laureate comment@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/13/theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["The passenger version of the A380 has raised the bar in luxurious air travel, with the first customer, Singapore Airlines, fitting its business class section with double-bed cabins."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-13T23:46:57Z", "title": "Alwaleed is first to order $310m personal superjumbo", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Prince Alwaleed bin Talal"], "article": "The world&apos;s 13th richest man has taken executive jetsetting to a new level with the first VIP order for the A380 superjumbo.

You don&apos;t need to have a PhD in psychology, of course, to realise that keeping busy is one way to take your mind off feelings of guilt or fear. When the guilt and fear are great, the flurry is correspondingly intense. I should probably resist the temptation to psychoanalyse someone I&apos;ve never met, but what the hell: my instinct is that some version of the manic defence might be playing itself out in Tony Blair&apos;s frazzled mind. As he scoots from lecture to lecture, tries get the Palestinian economy into shape and mulls over the prospect of a future EU presidency, I&apos;ll bet there&apos;s some part of him that&apos;s motivated by a horror of sitting back and surveying his career to date. I know I&apos;d rather be rushing from meeting to meeting than sitting at home thinking about David Kelly. Part of me feels sorry for him. Had he been prime minister in quieter times he would never have been asked to choose between waging war or alienating our closest ally. If the invasion had allowed Iraq to blossom into a new Japan, as some thought it might, Blair might now be able to rest on his laurels. In the event, it couldn&apos;t have turned out worse for him. But he wanted the job and he took the gamble - and since it failed, his furious schedule has to continue. He really hasn&apos;t stopped since he stepped down as prime minister in June, racing straight into the role laid on for him by the Madrid Quartet, arranging a book deal and getting stuck into the international after-dinner circuit. True, he&apos;s got a rather large mortgage to deal with, but this really goes beyond simply paying the bills. It&apos;s as likely motivated by a sense of personal responsibility for the collapse of Iraq. Keep busy and you won&apos;t have to think about it. And as if Palestine wasn&apos;t enough, now the EU presidency beckons. Technically, Blair has been president of the EU before, during the flagship summits of the UK&apos;s presidencies in 1998 and 2005. But when the rotating presidency ends, as planned for 2009, the European Council will elect an individual to serve an 18-month term, renewable once. The former PM&apos;s name has been touted, most notably by Nicolas Sarkozy, who will still be in control of his country&apos;s European Council representatives in 2009. So it&apos;s a distinct possibility. Blair himself sidestepped questions about running after a speech in Singapore on Friday. But, as we know from Hillary Clinton&apos;s own will-she-or-won&apos;t-she saga, a sidestep is as good as a yes. It was Bill Clinton, of course, who advised Blair to take a break before getting into elder statesman mode. But time off, though it may be sorely needed from a physical point of view, is not a welcome prospect for someone who needs to avoid thinking about past failures. Blair&apos;s particular psychodrama is bad news for the rest of us. His appointment as envoy for the quartet was a mistake. He&apos;s widely seen in the Middle East as the instrument of a hypocritical American foreign policy, as more of the same. This would be just as significant a drawback were he to become a figurehead for the EU. In key &quot;neighbourhood&quot; zones, from North Africa to Lebanon, a Blair presidency would be interpreted as a confirmation that the old &quot;war on terror&quot; mentality, which we might have hoped would die with the second Bush administration, lingers on. But Blair is trying to ignore, or perhaps, through acceding to ever-higher office, eclipse the enormous mistakes he made as UK prime minister. This is why, I think, he covets the EU job, and why he will feel compelled to be active in global affairs until the day he dies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/14/china", "sentences": ["&quot;This is another sign that the Chinese growth engine continues to hum along and it offers reassurance that China will remain a driver for global growth and compensate for a slowing in the U.S.,&quot; said David Cohen, an economist at Action Economics in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-14T15:26:34Z", "title": "China retail sales hit record in October", "tags": ["Business", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Chinese retail sales jumped 18.1% in October from a year earlier, the fastest pace on record, propelled by rising incomes, accelerating inflation and windfall gains from the surging stock market.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 17.2% rise.The spending figures are nominal and so are flattered by fast-rising consumer prices, which rebounded to an 11-year peak of 6.5%t in October, said Zhang Xinfa, an analyst with Galaxy Securities in Beijing.&quot;Growth like this above 18% is not sustainable. It will drop back to around 17% in the next two months,&quot; he said. Shoppers were out in force last month because of a week-long national holiday in early October and the wealth effect from booming stock and property markets. &quot;People have earned money in the stock and property markets and are now taking money out to increase their consumption. People now really have more money to spend,&quot; Zhang said. Stock prices have doubled this year, while figures released earlier on Wednesday showed annual property price inflation in 70 major cities quickened to 9.5% in October from 8.9% in September.In the hot markets of Beijing and Shenzhen, real estate prices were up more than 15%. The impact of inflation, which has been driven by higher food costs, was evident in a partial breakdown released by the statistics office. People spent 45% more last month than in October 2006 on grain, edible oils, meat and poultry. Stripping out the impact of inflation, Yiping Huang with Citigroup in Hong Kong estimated that sales in volume terms are rising between 11% and 12% a year. &quot;We think consumption is improving in China, though still at a very modest pace,&quot; he said. The sturdy sales are welcome news for policy makers, who are striving to tilt China&apos;s growth away from investment and exports and towards consumption.The government has launched a raft of initiatives, including cutting taxes and scrapping school fees, to leave consumers with more spending money. Urban disposable incomes rose 13.2% from a year earlier in real terms in the first nine months, while rural cash incomes were up a real 14.8%. Retail sales in urban areas rose 18.6% last month with sales in the countryside, home to 56% of China&apos;s 1.3 billion people, up 17.1%. &quot;If consumption is strengthening, then authorities should be in a better position to introduce policies to correct the structural economic imbalances, including slowing investment a bit further and trying harder on narrowing the trade surplus,&quot; Citigroup&apos;s Huang said. The quality of the retail sales figures is poor, even by China&apos;s standards, as they exclude services, except catering, and include purchases by the government and firms as well as by households. The statistics office breakdown by products also showed every category except telecommunications posting a much bigger rise than the overall 18.1% figure.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton Puck put a girdle round about the earth. So too does Shakespeare: our greatest roving ambassador. The RSC&apos;s King Lear has apparently been wowing them worldwide, though I was amused to hear Ian McKellen had to keep his underpants on in Singapore. Tim Supple&apos;s Indian Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream next year sets off for Australia, America and Canada. And Michael Pennington told me recently that his superb one-man show, Sweet William, will shortly be heading to Minneapolis. It all sounds wonderful: a tribute to Shakespeare&apos;s global reach. And there is little doubt that travelling Shakespeare around can bond a company. Hence the old theatrical gag about the actor who was asked if Hamlet ever slept with Ophelia. &quot;Only on the tour,&quot; came his reply. But touring, whereby productions have to be expanded and contracted to suit the space, can also be a hazard. On my first trip to the States I accompanied the RSC to Los Angeles where they were playing a Stratford Much Ado in the barn-like Ahmanson Theatre. It was strong enough to survive; but I also saw how lines had to banged across to reach the back wall of the cavernous auditorium. Tim Supple&apos;s Dream, you might think, won&apos;t have any such problems. This, after all, is a gorgeous, retina-ravishing spectacle filled with acrobatics and irridescent colour. But, having now seen it in Chennai, Stratford&apos;s Swan and London&apos;s Roundhouse, I&apos;ve learned one thing: it also depends heavily on physical intimacy and the audience&apos;s relish for the interaction of English and seven other languages. It was actually at its least effective at the Roundhouse where the text was muffled by the building&apos;s shaky acoustic. But people who&apos;ve seen it in Richmond and Watford have accosted me with glowing reports. In Shakespeare, you always come back to the tactile power of the words. And I just hope that this mesmerising Dream, in its global travels, is not shunted into theatrical equivalents of the Grand Canyon. All theatre depends on a contract between space and subject: I no more want to see a pocket-sized version of Wagner&apos;s Ring (though I once did) than I wish to see The Caretaker played in Madison Square Garden. Michael Pennington is certainly aware of the problem. He told me recently that Sweet William has been booked into a 700-seater at Minneapolis&apos;s new Guthrie Theatre. &quot;You do know,&quot; he told them, &quot;that it&apos;s just me and a chair.&quot; He was instructed not to worry: they have enough subscribers to fill the theatre. Pennington is also a canny enough old campaigner to adjust his performance to the size of the house. But I still think this is a show ideally suited to small venues. It&apos;s back at London&apos;s Arcola next week and, if you can get to it, do: it offers the most practical, informed guide to Shakespeare that I&apos;ve ever heard in a theatre. Everyone, understandably, wants it. But, while I can see that touring is the only way to meet audience demand, it has built-in risks. Put the right show in the wrong space and you end up with a blurred carbon-copy. And, while I&apos;m delighted that Shakespeare apparently speaks to everyone the world over, he speaks best when the words make a tangible, physical impact on the audience. Otherwise you might as well be watching Cirque du Soleil."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/16/eu.comment", "sentences": ["Once again the US is ranked as the most competitive economy, with the UK a respectable ninth, just behind Japan and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-16T00:18:05Z", "title": "Leader: Best of both Britain and Europe", "tags": ["European Union", "Politics", "World news"], "article": "For a decade, Gordon Brown has eagerly depicted the British experience as the shape of things to come for other Europeans. Scarcely a speech goes by without him making a withering comparison between the dynamism of the British economy and the sluggishness of western Europe, with its over-regulated labour markets, protectionist instincts and general lack of competitive zing. Germany was often singled out for special condescension. The insistent message was that Europeans had nothing to teach us, while we were the new global paradigm. Germany had to reform along British lines. Unless they did so, we and not they would be Europe&apos;s economic miracle. It was always an intellectually dubious claim. The World Economic Forum annual competitiveness survey for 2006-7 has now subverted it further. Once again the US is ranked as the most competitive economy, with the UK a respectable ninth, just behind Japan and Singapore. Yet Germany ranks fifth and Sweden fourth. Mr Brown&apos;s disdainful chauvinism cannot explain this. While both continental economies have been subjected to internally controversial reform programmes - as France, ranked 18th, is also currently experiencing - they still retain much stronger social welfare and solidarity systems than in Labour&apos;s post-Thatcher Britain. Yet for Mr Brown, ours is the only route to success. Mr Brown is wrong. There are different ways of being competitive. We have a choice. America offers one model. The UK a second. Germany offers a third - and with many attractive social and now also economic advantages too. The obvious truth is that Germany can learn things from us - but we can also learn things from Germany. Under the governments of both Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and Angela Merkel, Europe&apos;s most important country has reformed significantly without trashing its social values. Last year Germany posted its best growth rate in years. Now, as local and national elections loom, the momentum has slackened. Mrs Merkel&apos;s grand coalition is divided over the introduction of a minimum wage. This is not, mostly, a division between reform and anti-reform. It is about how you get the balance right. The same argument is also at the heart of British politics. This is one reason why the British debate about Europe needs to move on from its turgid obsession with the EU. This instinct comes naturally to the foreign secretary David Miliband, who made a meaty speech in Bruges yesterday about European reach and strategy. Its core was a plea for an outward-looking, not an inward-turned EU. But it was underpinned by an ease about being European, not an insistence on being different or better.

The FT&apos;s reputation depends on the integrity of its reporting and its unflinching commitment to accuracy.&quot; The article incorrectly stated that Scott had resigned as chairman and implied this was linked to the departure of director Charles Saumarez Smith. In fact, Scott&apos;s fixed term of office comes to an end in August 2008. The correction also acknowledged that the \u00a340m acquisition budget referred to in the original article did not exist and withdrew accusations against Scott.

So I am not going to whine.&quot; When asked for a comment, Scott said: &quot;The apology and correction speak for themselves.&quot; This is the second time in a month that the FT has been forced to publish a high-profile correction.  In October, the paper ran an apology in its international and online editions apologising to the Singapore prime minister, Lee Kwan Yew, for a comment piece accusing him of nepotism without justification.  An FT spokesman said the two cases were quite different and the problem with the article about Lee Kwan Yew was about risk of libel, whereas the National Gallery piece contained full-blown inaccuracies. The spokesman confirmed that Haden-Guest had been sacked and emphasised that the paper wanted to uphold its reputation for strict accuracy. Haden-Guest wrote his weekly FT column on a freelance basis. Born in 1937, Haden-Guest was the son of Elizabeth Furse, who ran a once-famous restaurant off Sloane Square called the Bistro, and the grandson of a socialist MP who became a peer. He became a journalist after graduating from Cambridge University, moving to New York in the late 70s where he established a reputation as a socialite. He is commonly believed to be the model for Peter Fallow, the hard-drinking British journalist in Tom Wolfe&apos;s Bonfire of the Vanities, although Haden-Guest has called this a &quot;canard&quot;, pointing out that Fallow was described as a tabloid writer and several New York Post journalists have claimed to have inspired Wolfe. Haden-Guest is the author of several books, including True Colors - The Real Life of the Art World, and now divides his time between London and New York. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

So let&apos;s accentuate the positive for a change. Standard Chartered jumped more than 4% to \u00a317.31 on reports that Singapore&apos;s Temasek - which owns 17% of the Asian focused bank - had rebuffed approaches from three leading Chinese banks. Standard Chartered has been seen as a takeover target for some while, but this is the first time there has been any serious interest reported from China. And now, inevitably, to Northern Rock. Its shares are now down 15.5% to an all time low of 112.2p after it admitted that any offers were likely to be well below last Friday&apos;s closing price of 132.6p. It is hard to know how this is a surprise, since shareholders have been warned several times that they are likely to be left with little or nothing. Investors such as RAB Capital and Jon Wood&apos;s hedge fund SRM Global - who own around 13% - are not likely to be happy. Unless the government intervenes, expect to see an action group forming before long. Meanwhile Alliance &amp; Leicester lost another 3.6% despite a spokesman repeating what he said here on Friday that the bank was continuing to raise money successfully at near Libor. However Libor, the rate at which banks lend to each other, has been climbing again in recent days as credit fears re-emerge. For a Monday, there was an unusual amount of bid excitement. SABMiller, down 12p to \u00a313.32, paid $1.2bn for Dutch brewer Grolsh. SAB has been tipped as a bidder for Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which has already rejected an offer from Carlsberg and Heineken. SAB would not comment today about its intentions. Meanwhile keyhole surgery group Gyrus - which slipped last week after a patent dispute - jumped 54% to 614p after an agreed 630p a share offer from Japan&apos;s Olympus Corporation. The bid values Gyrus at \u00a3935m. But oil group Burren Energy fell 182p to \u00a310.06 after Italy&apos;s Eni said it was dropping its bid proposal after the UK group rejected a \u00a312 a share offer. ABN Amro said: &quot;This is a negative for Burren - for us Eni was a natural bidder for the company given the shared interest in M&apos;Boundi and the strategic foothold in Turkmenistan that the Nebit Dag assets would deliver. &quot;At least one other offer (at \u00a311.00) has been tabled (widely thought to be KNOC), and it remains to be seen what KNOC&apos;s intentions are, although at the very least this morning&apos;s events reduce the chances of a bidding war. &quot;Burren&apos;s reponse this morning appears to be a clear sign that it would be willing to negotiate if a bid came in at around \u00a312.50-\u00a313.00. We retain our hold recommendation, and while the shares initial reaction this morning is understandable, we would be buyers on prolonged weakness (i.e. down to \u00a310.00).&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/20/marketforces", "sentences": ["Standard Chartered, the Asia-focused business, climbed 15p to \u00a316.79 on reports that three Chinese banks had approached Standard&apos;s 17% shareholder, the Singapore investment agency Temasek, about buying its stake."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-20T23:51:00Z", "title": "Market forces: Thanksgiving worries add to jitters", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Leading shares suffered their biggest one-day percentage fall since the middle of August yesterday, as credit crunch fears returned with a vengeance. The FTSE 100 closed down 170.4 points at 6120.8, a 2.71% drop. The decline accelerated during the afternoon as Wall Street opened sharply lower, partly hit by a Goldman Sachs sell note on Citigroup. Goldman estimated that its rival may have to write off $15bn in bad debts stemming from the US sub-prime turmoil. Investors were also nervous about a US consumer slowdown ahead of the crucial Thanksgiving shopping weekend, after the DIY chain Lowe&apos;s cut its profit forecasts. Back on this side of the Atlantic, Northern Rock slumped to a new low of 104.2p, down 28.4p, as the bank made it clear that any rescue bids would be much lower than Friday&apos;s closing price. Traders also heard rumours of more banks running into funding difficulties, something which gained more credence when the three-month Libor - the level at which banks lend to each other - rose from 6.39875% on Friday to 6.4475%, the highest level since September 19. Alliance &amp; Leicester, which has been hard hit in recent days despite repeated assurances from the bank that it had no worries over funding, fell another 25.5p to 581.5p. Shore Capital cut its rating on A&amp;L from buy to sell and said: &quot;Underlying fears over A&amp;L&apos;s funding position have surfaced in recent weeks following reports that the credit crunch has re-tightened. While the core investment case for A&amp;L is still valid, the re-tightening of conditions in the financial markets has cast renewed doubt over its ability to source adequate funding going forward.&quot; There were only three firms in the FTSE 100 in positive territory and, perhaps surprisingly given the financial turmoil, one of them was a bank. Standard Chartered, the Asia-focused business, climbed 15p to \u00a316.79 on reports that three Chinese banks had approached Standard&apos;s 17% shareholder, the Singapore investment agency Temasek, about buying its stake. Standard&apos;s shares came off their best levels as the market fell and Chinese news wires carried the banks&apos; denials. The other two risers were the consumer goods group Unilever, up 13p to \u00a317.96 as it bought back shares and Investec issued a buy note, and the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew, 2.5p better at 575p in the wake of the \u00a3935m sale of its smaller rival Gyrus. The bid for Gyrus from Japan&apos;s Olympus Corporation was pitched at about 27 times forecast earnings for 2008, compared with the 20.5 times rating for Smith&apos;s shares. Gyrus itself jumped 207p to 607p on the news. Sebastien Jantet at Investec said a counter-bid was possible but not probable. &quot;There is always the scope for a counter-bid, possibly from Johnson &amp; Johnson or Stryker, both of whom we believe would be interested in Gyrus,&quot; he said. &quot;However, we do not think private equity would be interested.&quot; Among other major fallers were the property stocks. British Land lost 69p to 820.5p on talk that net asset values had dropped sharply since September, while the housebuilder Barratt Developments fell 24.5p to 480p after its trading statement reinforced concerns about the tough housing market. Its rival Persimmon was 39p lower at 789p. Miners were weaker as base metal prices fell, with copper at a near-eight month low. Antofagasta lost 54.5p to 657.5p, while Anglo American dropped 224p to \u00a328.62. The oil group Burren Energy slumped 173p to \u00a310.15 after Italy&apos;s Eni pulled out of a possible \u00a312-a-share bid for the firm. Burren said it had been willing to negotiate but Eni was not prepared to raise its offer. ABN Amro said: &quot;We believe Burren&apos;s response appears to be a clear sign that it would be willing to negotiate if a bid came in at around \u00a312.50 to \u00a313. We retain our hold recommendation, and while the share&apos;s initial reaction is understandable, we would be buyers on prolonged weakness (ie down to \u00a310).&quot; Elsewhere, ITV slipped 1.7p to 84.3p despite a relatively positive note on the broadcaster from UBS. It cut its price target from 100p to 90p, but raised its rating from sell to neutral. The DIY group Kingfisher fell 13.3p to 160.3p on continuing speculation it would cut its dividend. After UBS suggested this on Friday, JP Morgan joined in yesterday by forecasting a 40% drop in the payout and reducing its price target from 256p to 235p. Lower down the market, Marchpole, which designs and sells clothing and accessories for luxury brands, dropped 34.5p to 65p. Its half-year profits fell from \u00a34m to \u00a3500,000, partly through the termination of its licence for Yves Saint Laurent products late last year. But health and social care specialist Care UK added 20p to 365p after a 2% rise in full-year profits to \u00a314.5m and a confident outlook statement. Last week the shares were under pressure after it lost a diagnostics contract in the West Midlands. Investec said the results had come in ahead of its forecasts, and it believed the shares had been oversold."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/21/rollsroycegroup.theairlineindustry", "sentences": ["Rolls-Royce is to invest more than \u00a3150m over the next five years building new aero engine facilities in Singapore and the US to cope with rising demand and to curb its exposure to the dollar.", "The Singapore facility will assemble and test large civil engines used on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and its Airbus rival, the A350 XWB aircraft.", "Rolls-Royce stressed that the decision to invest in Singapore and the US did not reflect on its commitment to Britain."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-21T23:49:34Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce expands in US and Singapore to beat low dollar", "tags": ["Rolls-Royce", "Airline industry", "Business", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Rolls-Royce is to invest more than \u00a3150m over the next five years building new aero engine facilities in Singapore and the US to cope with rising demand and to curb its exposure to the dollar.

Rolls-Royce stressed that the decision to invest in Singapore and the US did not reflect on its commitment to Britain. The company said it had invested \u00a3837m in the UK - 80% of its total global capital investment- over the past five years. &quot;There is no impact for jobs in the UK,&quot; a Rolls-Royce spokesman said yesterday.  Unite, the union, responded carefully. Its national officer, Bernie Hamilton, said: &quot;Rolls-Royce&apos;s plans to expand into Asia and America is a result of a genuine need to respond to new market demands. However, we will be keeping a careful eye on the company&apos;s long-term plans; Unite is committed to ensuring that the UK remains the prime location for Rolls-Royce production.&quot; Rolls-Royce, which announced some time ago that it was looking at possible locations in Asia and the US, said its decision was underpinned by strategic considerations. It would give the company manufacturing capability close to two key markets. Demand for large civil engines was already strong in the Asia Pacific region and the US dominates the market for corporate jets. The move will allow Rolls-Royce to build and test its Trent engines on two continents and would reduce its exposure to the dollar."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/nov/22/art.theatre", "sentences": ["Lee Wen, from Singapore, produces some pencils, a newspaper and a fish, which he fashions into a model ship, before tethering a cabbage to his ankle and dragging it outside for a ceremonial burning."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-22T14:35:26Z", "title": "Vital 07 / Chinese Arts Centre, Manchester", "tags": ["Art", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture", "Art and design"], "article": "Performance art is a bit like ping pong: not everyone takes it seriously, but the Chinese do it better than most.

Some Asean parliamentarians have called for Burma&apos;s expulsion or at least suspension from Asean until it reaches some minimal level of civilised conduct. Since Burma joined in 1997, it has caused the grouping a series of diplomatic headaches over its refusal to release Burma&apos;s world-renowned leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and its failure to engage in steps towards serious dialogue and a transition away from military rule. In the wake of September&apos;s bloody crackdown, the US, Canada and EU countries have imposed tighter economic sanctions on the Rangoon junta. After the killing of Buddhist monks and expressions of &quot;revulsion&quot; by a Singaporean diplomat at the time, many Burmese had expected Asean to apply more serious pressure on their recalcitrant member. The Singapore summit marking 40 years of Asean has launched a new charter which enshrines good governance, the rule of law and human rights among its guiding principles. But the human rights provisions were so watered down that even Burma&apos;s prime minister General Thein Sein could sign this toothless declaration, making a mockery of the bloc&apos;s commitments. In spite of deep embarrassment at Burma&apos;s serial delinquency, Asean heads of state dismissed out of hand any suggestion that they should get tough, or that one of their members should be disciplined or punished. Singapore, one of the Burma&apos;s major trading partners, commented that this was &quot;not an option&quot;. But then such Asean stalwarts as Singapore and Malaysia have never be known for their love of human rights, given their use of a draconian internal security laws to detain anyone they don&apos;t like. No surprise then that Singapore banned any Burmese pro-democracy demonstrations during the summit. Asean leaders tend to argue they have little influence over Burma compared to such economic heavyweights as China and India. This self-effacing rhetoric underplays Asean&apos;s strategic importance. Asean is responsible for 51.3% of Burma&apos;s foreign exchange earnings, with the selling of gas to Thailand alone accounting for 43% of such transactions. Moreover, Thailand and Singapore together have contributed 98.6% of the foreign direct investment into Burma&apos;s economy over the last two years. All the arguments about sanctions failing against Burma hinge on the absence of an international consensus to impose sanctions. Asean&apos;s rationale is not so much that sanctions won&apos;t work, but rather they have no wish to see sanctions bring the junta crashing down. Their insistence on quiet diplomacy and &quot;constructive engagement&quot; is linked to fears that after the junta has been kicked out, chaos and disintegration must surely follow. One Asean official argued that the democratic opposition has no experience of governance so &quot;if there is no leadership, it [Burma] will disintegrate. Would you want a Yugoslavia in your backyard?&quot; This line just happens to be almost identical to the junta&apos;s own brand of propaganda and its rationale for military rule: that it is only the armed forces that have prevented Burma from breaking up in the face of diverse ethnic separatist movements. Burma analyst and Harvard alumnus Aung Naing Oo, forced to live in exile, hotly disputes the notion that Burma could so readily become another Yugoslavia. He insists that most Karen, Shan, and other ethnic minorities do not advocate independence, but rather autonomy within a democratic state. Asean has clearly failed the Burmese people and increasingly the opposition is skeptical that reconciliation talks being promoted by UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari are going anywhere. Talks have been tried many times, but the Burmese senior generals have made it clear that they do not have the slightest interest in conceding an inch to Suu Kyi, and the heroic forces of opposition who refused to be cowered by bullets and terror. What next for Burma? Not so far away Cambodia is conducting Asia&apos;s first genocide tribunal. East Timor should have been number two but Indonesian generals have so far got away with their murderous reign of occupation after the brutal annexation in 1975. Now is the time for the international criminal court to avail itself of the extensive documentation of military atrocities and crimes against humanity committed since General Ne Win first seized power back in 1962. The only engagement that should be entertained with the top Burmese generals -the junta that has inflicted so much poverty and suffering - is constructive engagement with international justice. Instead of talking to them, the world should be prosecuting them. And it is Asean&apos;s shame that they can still regard a military clique of mass murderers as constituting a legitimate member of their south-east Asian club."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/22/thanksgivingsmostimportanttradition", "sentences": ["I lived overseas for several years, and I never felt so homesick as on Thanksgiving Day, which of course was nothing but a working Thursday in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, where I spent my time."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-22T18:00:00Z", "title": "Thanksgiving's most important tradition", "tags": ["US news", "Football", "Sport", "Thanksgiving"], "article": "Thursday is Thanksgiving Day in the US, which means it&apos;s time for the three F&apos;s: food, family and football. The football is there for when the first two F&apos;s get to be too much to bear any more. This particular holiday has come to be the one all Americans can pretty much enjoy unreservedly. Thanksgiving isn&apos;t burdened with the crass free-market stench that pervades Christmas (and its &quot;Everybody, spend!&quot; cousins, Hanukah and Kwanzaa), nor the juvenile delinquency and dark religious overtones of Halloween, nor the egotistical rush toward self-improvement felt on New Year&apos;s Day (with its resolutions to become fit, happy and loved within the next 365, or else), nor the jingoistic fervour of Independence Day. What Thanksgiving has, blessedly, is football. Pigskin and turkey has been a traditional combo for far longer than most people realise. As far back as 1876, the Intercollegiate Football Association held its championship game on the holiday. Even before the turn of the century, the New York Herald declared Thanksgiving the &quot;official holiday for football&quot;. College and high school rivalry games have been as crucial a part of Thanksgiving as the drunken inlaw and the overcooked turkey. The NFL got in on the act in 1920, when the Akron Pros (there&apos;s a nickname that must have taken weeks to conjure) defeated Jim Thorpe and the Canton Bulldogs 7-0. In 1934, the Detroit Lions began a tradition of playing an annual Thanksgiving Day game in the Motor City. Dallas has also become an annual host, and last season, the NFL, unwilling to cede the night hours of the holiday to Snoopy and the drowsing effects of tryptophan, added a third game. Unfortunately, that game has become a political football, so to speak, between the league and cable television companies, in a tiresome struggle over money and the fate of the league-owned NFL Network. Best not to get into too much detail about the contretemps, lest you start to drift off. Suffice to say, many fans already gorged on non-stop football since noontime will be unable to watch until midnight. Why such of glut of televised gridiron, on a day meant to remind us of the blessings of family, a persecution-free life and nutritional plenty? Partially, it serves as handy social icebreaker. Many Thanksgiving gatherings involve distant relations and barely recognisable neighbours, with the occasional outright stranger thrown in. Since virtually all American males and a sizable majority of females have at least a working knowledge of the sport, having the game on in the centre of the gathering provides for an easy conversation starter. Or a convenient way out of a dull exchange about cousin Stanley, who was too busy with his ice-sculpting business to make it this year (but he sends his love). The frequent stops in the action are also perfectly suited to the distracted viewing one must endure at Thanksgiving gatherings. Few sports are so easily watched out of the peripheral vision while carving the bird or pouring another round of drinks. With a casual glance, the savvy viewer can take in field position, score, down and distance, and calculate the odds of whether the coming play is worthy of full focus. With a finely tuned ear, the histrionics of the TV announcers can usually key the fan to snapping his head away from crudites and toward the television, even when the volume is turned down low (the mute button is not an option on this day). One must also take into account those two American obsessions, violence and weather. Taking the second first, the crisp, late-autumn conditions of late-November make for perfect football weather, and the games pop from the TV screen during this time period (although once Detroit moved indoors, this crucial element was lost). It is also late enough in the year for the occasional winter storm to blow in and affect the game, usually for the better. My personal favourite Thanksgiving memory is that of a snowy game in Dallas in 1993, when a hapless giant named Leon Lett slipped on the slick field and fumbled a ball he should never have tried to pick up, costing his team the game. The image of the fallen behemoth lying miserably in the slush provided a perfect opportunity for the rest of us to give thanks and truly mean it. Meanwhile, the sanitised, pseudo-gladiatorial combat of football allows us to safely vent those aggressive passions that might otherwise lead to tragic circumstances inevitable when large amounts of family and alcohol are mixed together. I lived overseas for several years, and I never felt so homesick as on Thanksgiving Day, which of course was nothing but a working Thursday in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, where I spent my time. Looking deep inside, it wasn&apos;t the warm glow of family or the feast that I longed for - it was footy on the telly, my version of it. This realisation came all too swiftly and left me slightly sickened at myself, but I think if you asked most expats (the gents, anyway), they would confess to similar feelings."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2007/nov/23/guardianviralvideochart45", "sentences": ["&quot;Thanks to the last and greatest betrayal of the last and greatest of human dreams.&quot; Squares I&apos;m not quite sure how to segue between William Burroughs and a Singapore media company getting its management team to rap in public, so I won&apos;t try.", "11 Iris Varela entra a golpes a Gustavo Azocar originalAlmost six minutes of Venezuelan congresswoman Iris Varela going ballistic during a TV interview 12 Thanksgiving Prayer by William S BurroughsAn alternative, bleak prayer from William S.

The talks are the latest in a series of deals in the water industry, which is being targeted by a growing number of infrastructure funds keen to make safe and predictable investments that return a steady stream of cash. The consortium has offered 1100.65p a share in cash. The talks are well advanced and a deal could be announced as early as next week. The announcement was put out as rumours in the market sent Kelda shares higher in early trade. The shares closed at \u00a310.55, a 12.5% rise. Analysts have long tipped Kelda as a potential takeover target. It supplies water and waste services to 4.7m people and 140,000 businesses. The Bradford-based business last year saw operating profits of \u00a3333m on sales of \u00a3741m. It also repeatedly comes out well in Ofwat assessments. The other members of the consortium bidding for Kelda are GIC Special Investments, a Singapore investment company, and Infracapital Partners, the infrastructure fund of Prudential, the insurance group. The appetite for deals in the sector appears to be undiminished by the credit squeeze. Last month the Royal Bank of Scotland sold Southern Water to a consortium including Australia&apos;s Challenger Infrastructure Fund and JP Morgan for \u00a34.2bn. South Staffordshire Water also changed hands, going to the US investment fund Alinda for \u00a3400m.

The mobiles will contain the same security as chip and Pin cards, combined with the contactless communication system used in Transport for London&apos;s Oyster travel card. Early next year Barclaycard will run a trial of the technology on the back of its new &apos;OnePulse&apos; contactless card, which was launched in September. OnePulse cards are combined credit cards and Oyster cards, and also allow small purchases (under \u00a310) to be made without entering a Pin. About 1,000 retailers in the capital are already equipped with the contactless terminals for OnePulse, so putting the technology into mobile phones will not require them to install yet more expensive kit. Several hundred Barclaycard customers will be issued with compatible phones supplied by Nokia, which has been pushing the technology for several years. Richard Humbach, manager of mobile payment systems at Nokia, believes that mobile phones will transform the way we pay for goods. &apos;They will be much safer than contactless credit cards because the phone can be locked so the card number is not visible,&apos; he says. The phone will also record every transaction, so fraudulent use will be immediately apparent. If the phone is lost or stolen, it can be immobilised remotely. Visa will also offer to alert cardholders by text if one of their cards is being used in a suspicious way. Contactless payments by mobile phone could also allay fears that criminals could clone cards by using portable readers and standing next to card users. Shoppers will also be able to view their balances online at all times, which may go some way to preventing &apos;shopping fever&apos; taking over. According to Humbach, mobile phones may need a subtle redesign to cope with how we make contactless payments: &apos;In Singapore&apos;s transit system, they wave the card a centimetre or so above the payment pad, but in London they tend to wipe the card on the pad, so the phone may need to be reshaped to avoid scratching the camera lens.&apos; He expects mobile-phone payments to take off rapidly, limited only by the speed with which retailers are equipped with the readers: &apos;We can expect mass-market acceptance around 2010 or 2011,&apos; he predicts. Mobile-phone payment systems have already been delayed by a dispute with the networks over data privacy, Humbach says. &apos;The mobile-phone operators wanted to see the transaction details, because they felt they had a right to see data flowing over their networks. The payment community would not allow that, and now the networks have had to accept that they are just transferring encrypted data between the user and the card issuers.&apos; If the London trial is a success, the system will roll out nationwide and other card issuers are likely to follow suit. The technology conforms to international standards and is expected to be included in all new phones in the near future."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/nov/25/businessandmedia1", "sentences": ["But he thinks there are still plenty of opportunities among smaller and medium-sized companies quoted on the Hong Kong and Singapore exchanges, where valuations are less stretched."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-25T12:27:38Z", "title": "Your  investments: America flirts with dreaded D-word", "tags": ["Investments", "Money", "Business", "US news"], "article": "Repeat it softly, but some experts on the US economy have begun to use the word &apos;depression&apos;.  Not even the most prescient of forecasters can predict how big an impact the credit crunch and housing slump will have on corporate and consumer confidence. But the longer it all goes on, the more severe it is likely to be. Given that the bank lending market has been frozen for four months and shows no sign of thawing, and that the US housing market has been slipping for more than a year and shows no sign of recovery, it would be wise at least to plan for a significant slowdown - and then to pray that the world&apos;s policy-makers can head off a slide into a prolonged, Thirties-style depression. Jim Leaviss, head of retail fixed income at M&amp;G, does not think the situation will get quite that bad - although he points out that a housing market in decline across the whole of the US, rather than just in isolated pockets, is unprecedented. And he adds: &apos;There is a record overhang of houses on the US market; sales of houses are plummeting and house prices are falling. Plummeting US house prices have always resulted in - or coincided with - a recession.&apos; The banking shutdown is equally unprecedented: they are not just cutting back on lending to housebuyers or companies, but also to each other. Indeed, banks are probably paying more for their overnight funding than we are paying on our mortgages. And we have not seen the end of it: Citigroup, Barclays, Merrill Lynch and the rest have already announced big write-offs and the betting is there will be many more. Goldman Sachs estimates that because banks need capital to support their lending, every $1bn of losses they suffer cuts their lending capacity by $10bn - and it estimates that the impact of the credit crunch will be to slash lending capacity by $1trn. That means many companies and consumers that want to borrow to spend or invest will not be able to do so. Leaviss thinks this amounts to a &apos;huge destabilisation&apos; for banks and consumers. &apos;Without these, the prospects for growth are grim,&apos; he says, and he reckons there is a 50/50 chance of a recession. Tony Dolphin, director of economics and strategy at Henderson Global Investors, agrees that the risks are finely balanced, but he is not quite as gloomy as Leaviss. Dolphin thinks there is an informal pact in the US between companies and consumers - &apos;households are saying to companies: if you keep employing us, we will keep spending; and companies are saying: if you keep spending, we will keep employing you&apos; - so while unemployment is rising, the increase is not great and household income growth remains strong.  He points out that government bond prices are predicting a recession; the equity markets, however, are not. Despite recent weakness, the FTSE 100 remains above its low for the year and the Dow and S&amp;P indices are also healthy, particularly if you exclude the impact of falling bank shares. If the US enters recession, let alone depression, stock markets will fall sharply. Bonds, on the other hand, are looking better than they have for some time. Leaviss thinks that government bonds and top-rated corporate bonds now look good value, particularly because interest rates are likely to fall as global economies slow down.  But he cautions against the racier end of the corporate bond market, where defaults are likely to increase sharply from their current abnormally low levels. These are trading on yields of about 4 per cent above that on government bonds. Leaviss thinks that gap needs to widen sharply before they will seem good value. Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, agrees that bonds are starting to look attractive. He likes the Henderson Strategic and Aegon Sterling bond funds.  Chinese immunity can resist the Western chill The old adage has it that when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold. But a growing number of commentators think that China in particular, and Asia in general, could shrug off a US slowdown. That is one of the reasons for the spectacular performance of the Chinese stock market, which has more than doubled in the past year.  Research by Fidelity shows that although Chinese shares account for just 3.3 per cent of the value of global stock markets, Chinese companies now feature in the global top 10 in six industrial sectors. This includes: oil, where PetroChina has overtaken BP and is now the world&apos;s biggest company; telecoms, where China Mobile outranks Vodafone; and China Construction Bank, which has outstripped HSBC and Citigroup to become the world&apos;s largest bank. China Mobile&apos;s revenue grew by 21 per cent last year, while Vodafone&apos;s is increasing at less than a quarter of that rate, and it is adding more than 6 million subscribers every month. China Construction Bank&apos;s income growth is about 18 per cent and it does not have the exposure to sub-prime lending that is crippling banks elsewhere. But growth is still not fast enough to justify all these high valuations. Martha Wang, manager of the Fidelity China Focus fund, says: &apos;The valuations of certain Chinese companies are out of line with their Western competitors, occasionally because partial listings have created an imbalance between supply and demand. At times like these, stock-picking assumes an even greater importance.&apos;  Philip Ehrmann, manager of the Jupiter China fund, agrees that some Chinese companies are overvalued, particularly the A shares which are quoted on the local Chinese stock markets. But he thinks there are still plenty of opportunities among smaller and medium-sized companies quoted on the Hong Kong and Singapore exchanges, where valuations are less stretched. He points out that 2007 is likely to be the third consecutive year in which Chinese companies&apos; earnings have beaten analysts&apos; forecasts. Of course, much of that growth has come from exporting to countries such as the US and UK, where consumers are likely to become rather less enthusiastic about buying. And there is little doubt that it will be affected by a US slowdown.But Gigi Chan, manager of the Threadneedle China Opportunities fund, thinks that slowdown will be cushioned both by increasing trade with the rest of Asia and by growing exports to Europe, where the economy is looking healthier.  Chinese funds have had a spectacular year and a pause for breath, if not a fall, is an increasing risk. Long-term investors, however, should have some of their money there: Jupiter, Threadneedle and Fidelity funds are all worth considering."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/25/minutebyminute.sport1", "sentences": ["&quot;Bloody hell, will you look at that&quot; in bold: Group 1: Australia, Iraq, Qatar and China Group 2: Oman, Thailand, Bahrain, Japan Group 3: North Korea, Jordan, Turkmenistan, South Korea Group 4: Lebanon, Singapore, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia Group 5: Syria, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iran &quot;You just have to laugh at the Sheilaroos, moving to Asia because they wanted a more secure passage to the World Cup, only to be the third best team in their group,&quot; opines Peter Green."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-25T16:54:27Z", "title": "World Cup 2010 qualifying draw - as it happened", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Welcome to the 2010 Fifa World Cup South Africa\u2122 Preliminary Draw Show\u00ae.

From his first big break in the early 1970s when Virgin Records&apos; first signing, Mike Oldfield, sold more than 15m albums, Branson&apos;s empire has grown to span airlines, trains, soft drinks, bridal wear, mobile phones, TV, internet and, most recently, space travel. His preferred tactic is to pick industries with large, entrenched players and take the role of consumer champion. In 1984 his Virgin Atlantic airline took to the skies with carriers such as British Airways in its sights. While he has had mixed success with this formula in the rail industry, it has proved successful in areas such as mobile phones, and it was the strategy that took Branson into personal finance. Almost precisely 10 years ago, he launched an assault on high street banks with the Virgin One account which pooled a customer&apos;s savings, current account balance and mortgage to provide a lower overall mortgage rate. The result of a link-up with Royal Bank of Scotland, Virgin One was sold to its partner in 2001 for \u00a345m. Branson quit the mortgage business, but retains involvement in personal finance with Virgin Money. Having started out offering no-frills, tax-exempt savings in the mid-90s as Virgin Direct, the financial services arm now stretches from pet insurance to savings. A last minute rescue of Northern Rock would suit Branson&apos;s taste for public relations flamboyance. No Virgin launch has been complete over the years without a bevvy of scantily clad women and a &quot;stunt&quot; from the boss. When it comes to the financing of his ventures, Branson is not such a risk-taker. His mobile businesses in France and the US have Carphone Warehouse and American network Sprint backing them; Virgin Atlantic has Singapore Airlines as a 49% shareholder, while Virgin Media is less than 11% owned by Branson. For the Northern Rock bid, US insurance group AIG, US investor Wilbur Ross, international hedge fund Toscafun and Hong Kong-based First Eastern Investment will bear a large part of the financial burden of the deal, although the Branson and Virgin brands will be much in evidence."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/nov/26/chess.features11", "sentences": ["Surviving Changi by Olimpiu Urcan (Singapore Heritage Society) is the biography of the little-known British player Eugene Colman (1878-1964), known for his contribution to a line in the Two Knights defence: 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Nf6 4 Ng5 d5 5 exd5 Na5 6 Bb5+ c6 7 dxc6 bxc6 8 Qf3, and now, Colman&apos;s suggestion, 8...Rb8, with sharp play."], "publicationDate": "2007-11-26T09:54:32Z", "title": "Ronan Bennett & Daniel King: Chess", "tags": ["Chess", "Sport"], "article": "Black has just played the speculative 36...Rxf4+.

For some time it provided the black side of the Two Knights with a tricky resource, but it&apos;s a rare bird these days other than at club level. There are 235 games appended, mostly Colman&apos;s (the others relate to the development of his line in the Two Knights). The games are lightly annotated and, with a few exceptions, pretty average. Colman&apos;s game against Smith, for example, is a comedy of errors. For reasons known only to himself, White played 37 Kg3 (after the obvious 37 exf4 Qxh4+ 38 Kg2 hxg4 39 Rh1 Qf6 40 Qxg4 Bxd4 41 Rc7+, White would have emerged from the ensuing exchanges materially up and with a devastating attack). Colman seized his chance with 37...Rxe5. 38 Kxf4 Qxh4 39 dxe5 Ne6+ 44 Rxc6 Bxc6 45 Qe2 hxg4 46 e6 g3+, and White resigned.

Park&apos;s imperious physique ignited Schwarzenegger&apos;s boundless ambition and ushered in a new age of muscle. &quot;When he hit the lat spread,&quot; said Arnold, &quot;it was like someone had closed the curtains.&quot; Park&apos;s subsequent film career as the rugged hero of five sword-and-sandal sagas offered Arnie further inspiration, and his family gave the future governor a model of what he wanted his own family to be. Park&apos;s life, though, was more than just a paradigm for Schwarzenegger. He was born Roy Park in Leeds, the son of a gym proprietor whose first name he came to be known by, and, in his teens, was a precocious athlete. At 16, he ran the 100-yard dash in 10.3 seconds, recorded a long jump of 21ft 10in and was selected for Leeds United&apos;s reserve team. A wrenched knee changed the course of his life. In hospital he picked up a copy of Health and Strength magazine and saw a picture of Vic Nicolette becoming Mr New York City. &quot;All at once I knew this was how I wanted to look.&quot; Park worked as a physical education instructor in Singapore during national service, but made it back to London just in time to catch the 1948 Mr Universe contest. On the small stage before him were the two dominant physiques of the day, both American: the squat, dense bulk of John Grimek and the classical, free-flowing lines of Steve Reeves. Over the next decade, Park would build a body that combined their qualities. He did so in conditions that would be anathema to modern strength athletes, struggling for nutrition in a country with ration books. Yet so rare were his genetics that he stacked on 20lb of muscle in a month and became Mr Britain in 1949. Reeves beat him to the 1950 Mr Universe title, but Reg broke the American monopoly the following year, and won again as a professional in 1958 and 1965. A shade over 6ft tall, he packed 250lbs of beef on his frame. He could bench press 500lb and squat over 600; power was the bedrock of his physique. The deep, grainy muscle that glowed with hardness under the bright stage lights came only with shifting huge weight. In America, Park won the approval of Joe Weider, the self-appointed &quot;father of bodybuilding&quot; and became a staple of Weider&apos;s many magazines. From their pages, the young Schwarzenegger clipped Reg&apos;s pictures for his bedroom wall, pictures that had his domineering father sneering: &quot;Are you a queer?&quot; Schwarzenegger came to the UK to seek Park out, and the baby-faced giant caused a sensation at the 1966 Mr Universe, finishing second before an audience that included J Paul Getty and Jimmy Savile. He and Park met a few days later, and Arnold began to copy the fluid posing routines that Reg had developed with his wife Mareon, a former ballet dancer. Arnie even cribbed his dramatic stage music, from the film Exodus, and made it his own. Schwarzenegger would become the first giant of the anabolic era, when nutrition combined with steroids to build progressively freakier physiques. By that time, Reg had made the five movies (1961-65) that suggested there was a market for muscle beyond the contest stage. All were Italian epics, four featured Hercules and in one, Hercules at the Centre of the Earth, 1961, he co-starred with Christopher Lee. Park also appeared, joshing with Schwarzenegger, in Pumping Iron, the 1977 documentary that gave the sport its fleeting glimpse of a golden era. Reg and Mareon opened a chain of gyms in South Africa, where Reg was still training clients into his seventies. In February 2007, at the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger&apos;s own annual contest, he appeared on stage for the final time. Handed a lifetime achievement award by his protege, Reg&apos;s acceptance speech was a masterpiece of brevity: &quot;This is not a talk show, it is a see show, so I&apos;ll let you get on with the show.&quot; Arnold, as ever, was more loquacious: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be here today if this man hadn&apos;t inspired me the way he did.&quot; Park leaves Mareon, his wife of 55 years, a son Jon Jon and daughter Jeunesse. \u00b7 Roy &quot;Reg&quot; Park, bodybuilder and actor, born June 7 1928; died November 22 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/29/schools.booksnews", "sentences": ["The literacy league: 1 Russian Federation 565 2 Hong Kong 564 3 Canada, Alberta** 560 4 Singapore 558 5 Canada, British Columbia 558 6 Luxembourg 557  7 Canada, Ontario 555  8 Italy 551  9 Hungary 551  10 Sweden 549  11 Germany 548  12 Netherlands 547  13 Belgium (Flemish) 547  14 Bulgaria 547  15 Denmark 546  16 Canada, Nova Scotia 542  17 Latvia 541  18 United States 540  19 England 539  20 Austria 538 21 Lithuania 537 22 Chinese Taipei 535 23 Canada, Quebec 533 24 New Zealand 532 25 Slovak Republic 531 26 Scotland 527 27 France 522 28 Slovenia 522 29 Poland 519 30 Spain 513  31 Israel 512 32 Iceland 511 33 Moldova 500 34 Belgium (French) 500 35 Norway 498 36 Romania 489 37 Georgia 471 38 Macedonia 442 39 Trinidad and Tobago 436 40 Iran 421 41 Indonesia 405 42 Qatar 353 43 Kuwait 330 44 Morocco 323 45 South Africa 302 *The average reading, writing and comprehension test score per pupil ** Canadian provinces have different education systems and were tested separately"], "publicationDate": "2007-11-29T23:49:08Z", "title": "England plunges in rankings for reading", "tags": ["UK news", "Books", "Politics", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy"], "article": "England has plummeted from third to 19th in an international league table of children&apos;s literacy levels as pupils replace books with computer games, according to a global study of reading skills. A generation of 10-year-olds are losing confidence in books, spending fewer hours a week reading at home and enjoying it less than five years ago, the study published yesterday found. Ministers immediately announced a \u00a35m scheme to make more books available in nurseries and promised more radical reforms to the controversial literacy strategy. They also called on parents to read with their children. Headteachers said that the government&apos;s literacy strategies - under fire after a series of critical reports - were to blame for taking the &quot;buzz&quot; out of reading and putting children off. In 2001, England ranked third in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (Pirls) study. The results for 2006, published yesterday simultaneously in each of the 45 countries and provinces included, put it at 19th. Only Morocco and Romania fell more rapidly than England. Scotland fell from 14 in 2001 to 26 last year. The study, based on questionnaires and reading, writing and comprehension tests taken by 215,000 children around the world, found that in England children have less confidence in reading and writing than in 2001. They also have the biggest computer game habits; 37% spend more than three hours a day playing games. Reading skills declined most for high achievers, and faster for girls than boys. Just 2% of pupils in English schools receive extra support to encourage an enthusiasm for reading, compared with a quarter of many other countries. The proportion of pupils getting daily reading homework is down from 26% in 2001 to 17%. Pupils in English schools are the least likely to do reading comprehension exercises regularly. Under the government&apos;s literacy strategy, there has been a significant shift away from whole-class teaching to small ability group lessons in reading and writing. About 25% of pupils were mainly taught in mixed ability groups in 2001, compared with 6% in 2006 - a much lower proportion than in other countries. The children&apos;s secretary, Ed Balls, said he accepted some responsibility for the decline in standards but also blamed parents. &quot;It&apos;s outside school and in children&apos;s attitudes where we have seen more changes since 2001. Today&apos;s 10-year-olds have more choice than in 2001 about how they spend their free time. Most of them have their own TVs and mobiles, and 37% are playing computer games for three hours or more a day - more than in most countries in the study. I&apos;m calling today for everyone&apos;s help to get our children reading more and to kick-start a new national debate about the value of reading.&quot; A series of reports from the Cambridge University Primary Review have been highly critical of the government&apos;s reading strategy. Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Europe&apos;s largest teaching union, said: &quot;A bookless house is a massive disadvantage for a child learning to read. Likewise, our prescribed and overloaded curriculum and testing system is sapping young people&apos;s enthusiasm of reading for pleasure.&quot; Mick Brooks, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: &quot;Unless children get a buzz out of reading, the computer will remain much more interesting to them. The national literacy strategy has made for an incredibly full timetable where children are taught to pass tests, not love reading.&quot; The shadow children&apos;s secretary, Michael Gove, said: &quot;It&apos;s time the government stopped blaming parents and accepted the case we&apos;ve been making for a new focus on teaching reading, using tried and tested methods.&quot; The Liberal Democrat spokesman for schools, David Laws, said: &quot;Ministers should be ashamed that England has plummeted down the international league table.&quot; Researchers in 45 countries and regions tested 215,000 10-year olds on their reading and writing skills and quizzed them on their reading habits, including how many books they have at home. Researchers from the National Foundation for Educational Research conducted the study in 150 schools in England and 130 more in Scotland in May and June 2006. A total of 4,036 pupils in England took part and 3,775 in Scotland.

Every week another landmine blows up under government benches and each minister wonders who&apos;s next. No one can guess the next catastrophe - but there will be more, you can bet on it. It is a rule in politics that once a government is sucked into a vortex, everything that happens becomes part of a failure &quot;syndrome&quot;. However unconnected a bank, immigrant security guards, missing discs and a dodgy donor, they are all whirled together by the enemy into a downward spiral. Minor mishaps become syndrome symptoms. Once that happens, the carrion crows grow intrepid. Former top brass find the brass neck to stage what is virtually an insurrection from the Lords red benches. A confident government would have slapped the old junta down. As for the press, Brown&apos;s endless appeasement of Murdoch and the Daily Mail are of no avail once a Labour government grows weak. The Mail&apos;s vitriolic attacks on Harriet Harman, the feminist they hate most, offered no shred of evidence she knew who the money was from. Words fail at the very idea that Lord Rothermere should be allowed to sponsor an academy: specialism hypocrisy and prurience? Over this latest crisis, Labour MPs, ministers and supporters hold their heads and groan. How can it have happened? Wasn&apos;t checking the donations No 1 on Brown&apos;s to-do list when he stepped into No 10, so rashly boasting of his moral compass? And whatever happened to that list? Did someone lose that long-awaited grid of 100 days of change? How Labour fell into this vortex is for history: how to get out of it is what matters now. Yet ask around the key players and their answers are all over the place. Those on the back benches cry, &quot;Forward!&quot; Those in the front cry, &quot;Steady on, it&apos;s all about delivery.&quot; Ministers are hunkered down in their silos up and down Whitehall, being micro-managers instead of talking together, thinking politically or shaping Labour&apos;s direction. Delivery is indeed essential, but not enough. Like &quot;integrity&quot; it has a habit of exploding in your face. Take yesterday&apos;s report on 10-year-old reading skills. How can England have plunged from third to 19th in five years, spending so much to go backwards? It almost certainly didn&apos;t. Top readers may be reading less and computer-gaming too much, but does anyone really think Russia is genuinely top, above Sweden, Singapore and Canada? (The Russians leave out their bottom children: if they can&apos;t read, it&apos;s a sign of mental deficiency.) Other countries measure in other ways. Canada last time was one country, but now appears as separate states four times in the list. But the story will stick, partly because Britain does have serious literacy problems. Yet anyone impartial would say that teaching, lessons and schools are almost unrecognisably better than a decade ago. Ditto health: myriad problems remain, and the NHS is not good enough, but it&apos;s a great deal better than it was with waiting times right down. So why don&apos;t people think so? Why doesn&apos;t &quot;delivery&quot; deliver political success? Because without public trust, no one believes a word politicians say. Polls show that their view of the NHS goes up and down with their view of the government, not the other way round. They don&apos;t believe statistics - or only the bad ones. Labour can regain enough goodwill and even some admiration from former supporters in this remarkably volatile political mood, but only if it takes bold action now. What can be done by the next election? Choose two clear themes and blast away at them non-stop every day, in every way. Take this latest catastrophe and declare it as their symbolic no-turning-back point for cleaning up politics. Go hell-for-leather for a fair party funding bill. Let no one donate more than \u00a31,000 or so a year. Let the state put in around \u00a330m more - peanuts for getting dangerous donors out of politics. Use Unlock Democracy&apos;s proposal for matched funding, forcing parties to seek new members. Trade unions will have to mail their members annually to confirm individually that they wish to stay Labour party members: a small price to pay for rescuing politics. Britain is virtually the last country in the west not to clean up funding. It won&apos;t stop all scandals, but it will purge the worst. That&apos;s only the start. Parties are dying on their feet, contempt for politics is alarming and only radical change will jump-start its motors. When the Lords reform white paper appears in January, dash to implement a 100% elected small second chamber. At the same time, go for a referendum on proportional representation right now, so the next election doesn&apos;t turn on just 8,000 indifferent votes, but makes every vote count. If necessary go for a simple multimember model, where in a matter of weeks constituencies can be bunched together, no MPs lose their seats and defy the Tories to oppose a fairer system. It would be a hard battle, but at least Labour would lead something worth fighting for. Old-timers say this is all Westminster village wonkery that doesn&apos;t engage voters&apos; real concerns. But this goes to the heart of the rottenness of politics, and once battle began, voters would see it clear as day. Unless politics is done better, unless parties are obliged to seek every single vote, sign up every local member they can, spend less at the centre, waste less on political junk ads, then nothing else government does will engage voters much either. Incidentally, bad timing for yesterday&apos;s latest message from Labour: &quot;This Saturday, December 1, is our final National Campaign Day for 2007 ... with a huge campaigning event.&quot; First, they should spend time deciding what it is they are campaigning for. For the next two years, Labour should devote itself to two themes - to the Augean cleaning up and opening up of politics - despite considerable pain to itself. And, secondly, Labour should commit itself and brand itself as the party for children. It&apos;s what they&apos;re best at, what they care most about, where their heart is; and it encompasses almost everything else, such as Brown&apos;s remarkably radical green renewable energy pledges and housing for children&apos;s future. The education bill widens concerns from schools, families and babies to the vital 14-19 diplomas and apprenticeships that bore news editors to death. If Labour wants a big promise, why not offer free nurseries and childcare - universal, irreversible and an immediate boon to all families? Brown, like Blair, has fallen under the spell of focus groups, those seductive echo-chambers that only reflect back what people already hear and read. To be sure they remind that crime and immigration must never be ignored. But leadership means seizing the initiative, not chasing public opinion shadows. People admire bravery, and that&apos;s Labour&apos;s only chance to break free from this vortex. Do things not because they are obviously popular, but because you obviously think they are right - and people will follow. How is it that, individually, many of the cabinet are radical, clever, energetic and genuinely passionate about social justice, and yet in public they have a kind of lock-jaw, talking jargon, boring for Britain at the conferences they briefly address, afraid of controversy? True, the bullying media jumps on any originality. But ministers should think politically and then speak their minds. If not, they really will be done for.  polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/02/standardchartered.useconomy", "sentences": ["Standard&apos;s biggest shareholder, Temasek Holdings of Singapore with 17 per cent, was recently asked if it wanted to sell to a consortium of Chinese banks."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-02T00:07:04Z", "title": "Standard forced out of Iran by Americans", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "US economy", "Banking", "Business"], "article": "American pressure has forced British bank Standard Chartered to sever its links with Iranian banks, despite connections with the country that go back to shortly after the Second World War. Michael Rees, head of Standard Chartered&apos;s wholesale bank, confirmed last week that his employer had broken off its relationship with the country because it feared for the safety of its US employees, who could have been charged with sanctions-busting. &apos;We don&apos;t undertake any business with the Iranians and have not done so for several months,&apos; said Rees. America is waging a financial war on Iran designed to isolate its economy from the world banking system and to compel Tehran to abandon its nuclear programme.  The US Treasury has persuaded European and Japanese banks to join their American counterparts and stop conducting any transactions for Iranian clients. Deutsche Bank has closed all accounts held by any customers, whether companies or individuals, based in Iran. As a consequence, Iran finds it difficult to raise loans, obtain foreign currency or hold any assets offshore. Iran&apos;s ability to buy essential imports is being eroded because obtaining dollars, euros or yen is becoming harder. America is using its financial might to shut Iran out of the global economy. The United Nations has passed two resolutions imposing sanctions on named Iranian individuals and companies. HSBC, Britain&apos;s biggest bank and the world&apos;s fourth largest, said that no dollar transactions were being conducted for Iranian clients and business links with Tehran were minimal. Three of Japan&apos;s largest banks have announced that no new business would be conducted for Iranian clients. Iran had avoided the US restrictions on dollar transactions by transferring assets into euros or yen. But this window is closing as European and Japanese banks enforce the same restrictions. Standard&apos;s biggest shareholder, Temasek Holdings of Singapore with 17 per cent, was recently asked if it wanted to sell to a consortium of Chinese banks. Although Temasek has refused to sell for now, the approach fuelled speculation that Standard could soon become a bid target for a Chinese bank or one of the country&apos;s sovereign funds. The Chinese stock market boom means its banks are in a strong position; their highly valued shares could be used to pay for a Western bank such as Standard.

The blurb, written before today&apos;s pardon, says: &quot;This bear is designed for all the people who think the British school teacher in Sudan who named a teddy bear Mohammed is being treated unfairly by the Sudanese courts.&quot; The same site is also selling a bear called the &quot;Tolerance teddy&quot; for slightly more money. 12.05pm Rob Crilly, who is covering events in Sudan for the Times, blogs that this is the &quot;perfect story&quot;. He writes: &quot;This is a great story because it&apos;s the sort of thing that makes people gather around watercoolers. It is terribly sad what has happened to Ms Gibbons. But if it&apos;s reported responsibly, people will be discussing the power struggle inside the Sudanese government and what lessons are to be learned for putting pressure on Khartoum over Darfur as they fill their cups with, erm, cool water. Or am I being naive? Does it just make people think Muslims are bigots?&quot; 12.20pm Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Canterbury has welcomed the news. He said: &quot;I am very glad and relieved for Gillian Gibbons and for her family that this time of extreme anxiety has now come to an end. It will be welcome news to all in Britain and elsewhere, Muslims included, who have seen this episode as a most unhappy over-reaction which has distressed people of all faiths and has caused such suffering to someone manifestly dedicated to the welfare of Sudan and its people.&quot; Appropriately enough he was speaking at a conference in Singapore for Christian and Muslim scholars. 12.25pm Gillian Gibbons has been freed. &quot;She is in British embassy custody and is with the deputy British ambassador,&quot; embassy spokesman Omar Daair told Associated Press. 12.45pm Gordon Brown is &quot;delighted and relieved&quot; by the news of the pardon (he&apos;s no doubt delighted and relieved by a bit of positive news for a change). 12.50pm Haras Rafiq, executive director of the Sufi Muslim Council, said: &quot;It was ridiculous that she was charged and imprisoned in the first place. It seems to me to be a bad sign for a country that it takes a presidential pardon to release her even though she has done nothing wrong. I am really pleased that she has been freed and she does not have to suffer any more.&quot;  1.15pm Sudanese blogger Black Kush wishes Gibbons well. &quot;I hope you don&apos;t bear grudges against the Sudanese people. The ragtag group into whose hands you fell are a minority and does not represent us at all.&quot; 2.25pm The Daily Mail has discovered Muhammad bears for sale on eBay. The Sunday Times claimed that 10,000 British Muslim families have bought teddy bears named after a Muslim prophet to raise money for the charity Islamic Relief. The Sudanese Thinker doesn&apos;t know whether to laugh or cry.  2.55pm   Dozens of Gillian Gibbons support groups have been formed on Facebook, including this one with more than 6,400 members.  3.20pm Two cars and van belonging to Asians in Dundee had the words &quot;teddy bear&quot; scratched on them, Tayside Police said today, according to Scottish Press Association. 3.55pm Foreign secretary David Miliband said that at worst Gibbons has been guilty of a misunderstanding. &quot;Her steadfastness and good cheer has been very noticeable. She has shown good British grit,&quot; he told a news conference. &quot;She is in remarkably good spirits,&quot; he said after speaking to her. &quot;She was a little overwhelmed by the amount of coverage she understood this case had received and proud of the way her family had stood up over the last week,&quot; he said.

Details of the Genting stake, bought over the last few days, are expected to be announced to the London Stock Exchange this morning.  Rank is believed to have discovered the shareholding in response to one of the enquiries regularly made by the company to potential stakebuilders but no discussions between the two sides have yet taken place. The Malaysian company already has a large presence in the UK, buying the casino operator Stanley Leisure for nearly \u00a3650m last year. However, in the past it has also taken stakes in companies only to sell them on to other predators rather than bid itself. Genting is one of many names recently linked with a move for Rank, whose shares have lost about a third of their value since the company issued a profit warning in October due to difficult trading at its bingo and casino operations. It has been hit particularly hard by the government&apos;s smoking ban. On Friday Rank&apos;s shares closed at 100.5p, valuing the company at about \u00a3390m. Last week it was reported that the US casino group Harrah&apos;s had approached Rank with a proposed asset swap. The idea was to inject Harrah&apos;s London Clubs International casinos subsidiary into Rank in exchange for a 28% stake in the enlarged company. But this is believed to have been turned down by Rank. News of the Genting move, however, could prompt a further approach from the US group. Others said to be interested in Rank included Singapore&apos;s BIL, which owns the Clermont Club in London, and UK rivals such as Ladbrokes and William Hill. Ivor Jones, at Evolution Securities, said in a note commenting on BIL last week: &quot;Acquiring Rank and its 45 licences would clearly accelerate BIL&apos;s casino strategy and it would have few, if any, competition issues.  &quot;BIL is part of a Hong Kong investment group we believe to have very deep pockets, controlled by one of the world&apos;s biggest casino gamers, Kwek Leng Chan.&quot; Jones has put a 175p-a-share price target on Rank, which is due to issue a trading statement next Wednesday."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/04/obituaries.guardianobituaries", "sentences": ["He then flew Hudsons on anti-shipping patrols before leading a group of five Hudsons to Singapore.", "He had no hesitation in saying what he thought about the bungling prior to the evacuation of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-04T00:04:33Z", "title": "Obituary: Terence O'Brien", "tags": [], "article": "Squadron Leader Terence O&apos;Brien, DFC and bar and Croix de Guerre, who has died aged 92, was a brave man and a brilliant pilot.

By early 1941 he was flying Blenheims, attacking the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau in Brest. He completed 30 operational flights, more than any other pilot over Brest. He also met Timmie, who worked in the SOE - and soon after the war they married. He then flew Hudsons on anti-shipping patrols before leading a group of five Hudsons to Singapore. By the end of February 1942, attempts to repel the Japanese failed and Terence made a hazardous escape to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in a small cargo ship. He had no hesitation in saying what he thought about the bungling prior to the evacuation of Singapore. In India, Terence became involved with Force 136, dropping agents and supplies to clandestine groups in Burma, and landed his Dakota in the dark on rough airstrips in Indochina to deliver French agents. Orde Wingate&apos;s force was planning its second incursion behind the Japanese lines. Terence wangled a job as an RAF liaison officer attached to the 4/9th Gurkhas, advising on supply-dropping zones, sites for airstrips, and directing pilots making bombing runs. After the war, Timmie became managing editor of Vogue and Terence became a freelance journalist. In the 1950s, with their son Nicholas, they moved to the Canaries and built the first postwar hotel in Tenerife. After five years, and with a second son, Roland, they returned to England for the boys&apos; education. Terence taught for 10 years in the local primary school, then with Spanish friends formed a tile-importing company. Later, he wrote three remarkable autobiographical books: Chasing after Danger, Out of the Blue and The Moonlight War. Timmie died in 1996.

Rank has been the subject of takeover speculation ever since a profit warning in October, with Genting, the US group Harrah&apos;s, Singapore&apos;s BIL and its rivals William Hill and Ladbrokes all mentioned at one time or another. But analysts cautioned that Genting may not be planning a bid but rather manoeuvring itself into a strong position should another predator emerge. Ivor Jones at Evolution Securities, who has a 175p target on Rank&apos;s shares, said: &quot;It is not necessarily the case that Genting&apos;s strategy is to buy Rank. The company has bingo assets which Genting may not wish to own, so it may be trying to create a situation where it buys the casino business from Rank.&quot; Overall, investors were not exactly full of seasonal cheer. Profit warnings showing that the credit crunch may be affecting consumer confidence helped push the FTSE 100 index 45.9 points lower to 6386.6 by the close. The pubs groups Mitchells &amp; Butlers, down 30.5p to 546.5p, and Enterprise Inns, 25p lower at 507p, were both hit by a gloomy outlook statement from their smaller rival Regent Inns, down 17.75p at 25p. Mitchells also suffered from a negative note from Numis, which cut its price target from 638p to 581p. The broker said: &quot;We are concerned that the group&apos;s top line is coming under increasing pressure. In addition its adjusted net debt now incorporates \u00a3180m of hedging losses and a \u00a3250m provisional pension deficit. We think the latter is an increasing obstacle to putting the group&apos;s property into a REIT.&quot; A Citigroup downgrade left leisure group Whitbread 41p lower at \u00a314. Citi cut its price target from \u00a320.26 to \u00a316.20, saying: &quot;While Whitbread is largely exposed to the budget hotel segment, which has proved relatively resilient in previous consumer slowdowns, pub restaurants could face softer demand in 2008. We therefore see downside risk to consensus forecasts.&quot; Tootsies owner Clapham House fell 98.5p to 150p after it warned on profits after a slump in visitors to shopping centres. The Restaurant Group, best known for Frankie &amp; Benny&apos;s, fell 25.75p to 192.25p in sympathy. The mood in the market was not helped by the feeling that the Bank of England will not cut interest rates this Thursday. Morgan Stanley strategists did their bit for the doom-mongers by saying: &quot;We believe the ongoing financial crisis will have a significant detrimental impact on economic growth, particularly in the UK and US.&quot; They set a FTSE 100 target for next December of 6300, unchanged from the current level. But they said: &quot;We believe the risks around this forecast are to the downside and set a bear case target of 5350.&quot; On the plus side, they highlighted 10 defensive stocks for 2008, including Tesco, up 8.75p to 487.75p, and International Power, 2p better at 469p. Back among the fallers, the engineering group Morgan Crucible lost 61.25p to 200.25p after it said the weak dollar would knock about \u00a36m from its operating profits this year. Northern Rock fell another 9p to 109p on concerns about the bid by Virgin and the prospect that whoever buys the bank, shareholders will be left with little. Standard Chartered dipped 49p to \u00a318.65p as UBS cut its recommendation from buy to neutral after a strong performance recently by the bank&apos;s shares. BP slipped 1.5p to 588.5p and Royal Dutch Shell fell 28p to \u00a319.38 as Brent crude dropped below $88 (\u00a344) a barrel on fears of a slowdown in the US economy. Opec ministers meet tomorrow to discuss possible production increases, although many analysts believe the group will decide not to pump more oil. Elsewhere, despite the worries about UK consumer spending, a few retailers managed to move into positive territory. Argos and Homebase owner Home Retail Group rose 11p to 358p as Panmure Gordon picked the business as one of its Christmas winners. Kingfisher, the retail group behind B&amp;Q, added 6p to 158.3p on the theory that if people are reluctant to move house, they may well do up their existing home.  Housebuilder Barratt Developments was 3.75p better at 469p on vague talk of a possible 600p a share offer, while Colt Telecom added another 8p to 190.25p in the wake of speculation reported here on Friday that America&apos;s AT&amp;T was interested in buying the business but 65% shareholder Fidelity was holding out for more money. Colt said on Friday it knew of no reason for the subsequent rise in its share price.  Goldman Sachs raised its price target from 158p to 178p and moved its recommendation from sell to neutral. Worthington on ice Investors in Worthington Nicholls are bracing themselves for more bad news. Shares in the heating systems group were suspended yesterday at 17.25p at the request of the new management team, including Simon Beart, chief executive. In June Worthington&apos;s shares stood at 170p but it has issued a severe profit warning since and seen its board ousted by rebel investors. Beart and his team are reviewing a trading statement issued on October 15 that said Worthington would break even for the year to September, before a \u00a36.5m write-off. It now seems more write-offs will be needed, meaning the firm could well report substantial losses. The board hopes to give a full update later this week. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/04/viewpoint", "sentences": ["The rumour mill suggests almost every name in town will take a look, from our own William Hill and Ladbrokes to Harrah&apos;s of the US and BIL from Singapore, owners of the Clermont Club."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-04T02:00:40Z", "title": "Nils Pratley: Time for another Rank bad decision?", "tags": ["Rank", "Business"], "article": "At last, the moment Rank shareholders have dreamed about for a decade - Malaysian group Genting has taken a 10% stake and the prospect of a bidding war is in sight. The rumour mill suggests almost every name in town will take a look, from our own William Hill and Ladbrokes to Harrah&apos;s of the US and BIL from Singapore, owners of the Clermont Club. Unfortunately, the excitement comes too late for those who have kept faith with Rank over the years. It is a shrunken business these days, down to its bingo halls and its casinos, plus a small online operation.  The list of businesses that various managements have failed to reinvent is extraordinary - Butlin&apos;s holiday camps, Odeon cinemas, Pinewood studios, Hard Rock cafes and DeLuxe video duplication. In the end, all were sold, usually about 20 years after their heyday. Rank will enter management textbooks as a case of how not to manage decline. Bingo is the latest business in crisis, brought on by the combination of the smoking ban, online gambling and tax changes. Thus Rank&apos;s latest managers are perceived to have their backs against the wall: a reasonable offer would be hard to resist, says the market. Well, maybe. But even at this late stage it would be nice to think that the management may be able to offer a credible vision of how to manage their way out of the mess. The fact is that the Grosvenor casino business, the part that Genting and everybody else covets, is a decent asset.  Tax changes and government U-turns on casino expansion have made life trickier, but on a medium-term view it&apos;s hard to regard casinos as anything other than a growth industry that rewards long-term investment. In the optimists&apos; camp, analysts at Evolution reckon Rank&apos;s share price could rise from 109p to 175p in a year with a decent profits recovery. That&apos;s the scale of ambition the management should be considering: selling out cheaply at this point would merely add to the catalogue of errors over the years. Gloom merchant It&apos;s the time of year when the City&apos;s analysts and strategists forecast what next year will bring. One of the first out of the block yesterday was Morgan Stanley&apos;s Teun Draaisma, who has achieved a certain fame in recent months by calling the August fall and the September rally in stockmarkets with uncanny accuracy. Draaisma, like most of his most of his brethren, no longer issues recommendations like &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;sell&quot;. Instead we get this: there is a 20% chance in 2008 of a bull market &quot;overshoot&quot;, in which stock markets rise 28% with the help of aggressive cuts in interest rates; there is a 45% probability of going sideways to gently down; and there is a 35% likelihood of global recession, which Draaisma and colleagues interpret as leading to a 19% plunge in share prices. Taken in the round, though, Morgan Stanley is saying there is an 80% chance of losing money, or making none, by being invested broadly in equities in 2008. Draaisma prefers cash, and his obligatory &quot;top 10&quot; portfolio for 2008 is stuffed with classic defensives such as utilities, pharmaceutical and tobacco companies and defence contractors. It&apos;s gloomy stuff, and perhaps not terribly surprising at a time when the UK high street is producing profits warnings at the rate of roughly two a day. Yesterday&apos;s culprits included the owners of Gourmet Burger Kitchen, the folk who priced their top-of-the-range burger at \u00a39.95. Not everybody has been so adventurous with their prices, but the implosion of the \u00a310 burger somehow feels like a minor landmark in the end of the consumer boom. Draaisma has his own &quot;keep it simple&quot; approach. Just as it was clear - if only in retrospect - that the technology bubble would burst in 2000, so he thinks people will wonder in 2012 why stockmarkets were so bullish going into 2008. His roll-call of negatives is familiar but worth repeating: the credit crunch; lower earnings from US corporates; oil at close to $100 a barrel; falling house prices; US consumers spending more than they save; and emerging markets being valued at a premium to developed markets for the first time in a decade. On the emerging markets front, Draaisma flourishes a nifty chart in which the states of the US are renamed for countries with similar GDPs. South Africa is the size of Wisconsin, Brazil is New York state and Russia is New Jersey. Sure, China is rather bigger, but the chart is a neat illustration of why emerging markets, even when they are roaring, need to be put into context. They generate enthusiasm, but when house prices are collapsing in California and Florida, the woes of the old world are still an enormous burden to carry. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/dec/04/aljazeeraenglishgainsnewte", "sentences": ["Al-Jazeera English has won permission to broadcast its news service in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-04T06:11:56Z", "title": "Al-Jazeera English gains new territory", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "Al-Jazeera"], "article": "Al-Jazeera English has won permission to broadcast its news service in Singapore.

A long way below, cyclists chance their luck cutting the paths of the taxis stacked on the city&apos;s third ring road. To the right of the traffic, on land the size of two football pitches, 3,000 pupils from Xi&apos;an middle school stand in neat rows waving their arms in tandem for zao cao - morning exercises. At exactly 9am, the loudspeaker system is switched off. And without fuss, the 15- to 17-year-olds walk to their first lessons. It has long been assumed in the west that Chinese schools encourage a collectivist mentality, are obsessed by exams, spoon-feed their students and are closed to links abroad. But several of China&apos;s top schools - including this one - can now do much more than challenge these assumptions. In elite schools, major shifts in government education policies are being implemented almost overnight and sustained by vast investment, producing experiments in education that would be deemed radical by western standards. Education Guardian accompanied five UK secondary headteachers on a British Council trip to Beijing and Xi&apos;an - their prize for winning the regional finals of the Teaching Awards 2006. The aim: to partner up with a Chinese school, see the rapid changes being made to the Chinese education system, and drool. Avant-garde teaching is in action at another school, called Middle School Attached to Shaanxi Normal University (Shaanxi middle school). A group of four 15- and 16-year-olds are taking their peers&apos; art lesson while their teacher observes their communication skills. At the end, pupils are asked to evaluate the lesson with an A, B, C or D grade. &quot;This would be a radical departure from conventional teaching methods in the UK,&quot; says Geraint Rees, headteacher of Ysgol Plasmawr, a comprehensive in Cardiff. It&apos;s all part of China&apos;s New Goals reforms. The plan is to overturn teaching methods in the Asian powerhouse, province by province. The education ministry wants to do away with decades of rote-learning in favour of groupwork, class discussions and role-play. The emphasis is on communication skills rather than fact-absorption. On the Chinese education ministry&apos;s website, it says: &quot;Quality education and moral education have gained a new momentum.&quot; Too right, says Zhang Fan, a teacher at Shaanxi middle school. He explains it in the terms of an ancient Chinese proverb. Showgen eeyu buru showgen eeyzu - It is better to teach someone how to fish, than to give them the fish.&quot; The New Goals reforms are being rolled out with alarming speed, at least in the elite schools. In Shaanxi province, the reforms were introduced this September for senior one pupils, who are aged 15. Teachers at Fan&apos;s school had just five days to learn the new teaching methods of groupwork and role-play exercises, and to get used to new textbooks. Chinese teachers admit they haven&apos;t found it easy. He Lina, an English teacher at Shaanxi middle school, says: &quot;If you had come here last year, you wouldn&apos;t have seen this style of teaching. The students think more as a result, but they also find it tiring. It has been hard for everyone to make the jump.&quot; Li Hong, the vice-principal, can see its benefits. &quot;Before the reforms, teachers told the children how to think. In five or 10 years&apos; time, the pupils will have the spirit to learn by themselves.&quot; Xiqi Hou, a grade one English teacher, says: &quot;Last year, I would have just been doing language exercises with the pupils and then explaining the answers. Now it is listening, writing and comprehension. We see the shortcomings of the previous system.&quot; The Chinese government pledged last year, in its 11th five-year plan, to pour 14bn yuan (\u00a3920m) into vocational training between 2006 and 2010, and to skill an extra 36 million workers. It is a U-turn on previous policies, which cut the budget for vocational education. The government anticipates that the number of students in vocational schools will soon be equal to those in the more academic equivalent, senior high schools for 15- to 17-year-olds. At Xi&apos;an middle school, the heads are surprised to hear the headteacher, Wang Lanjun, explain how he has already sealed partnerships with schools in Japan, Italy, Korea, Australia and Singapore - and is looking for more. &quot;International links are the exception rather than the rule in UK schools,&quot; says Rosy Litawski, principal of The Ferrers Specialist Arts College, a comprehensive in Northamptonshire. Ge Wang, a 17-year-old student at Shaanxi middle school, is just one of the pupils who has spent a year abroad and hopes to go to university in the US. &quot;I have to admit pupils at my school don&apos;t apply to universities abroad,&quot; says Litawski. &quot;Now I&apos;m wondering why not.&quot; At Xi&apos;an Bodi middle school, the heads ask for translations of the phrases in calligraphy that hang on the walls. &quot;A tolerant person will have many friends&quot; is one. &quot;Contentment is the least I expect today&quot; is another. Both are evidence of China&apos;s recent driveto emphasise traditional notions of proper conduct, familial duty, respect for others and social responsibility. &quot;China&apos;s children are getting clear messages about mental and social wellbeing. Our kids don&apos;t even think this way,&quot; says Rees. &quot;We don&apos;t articulate principles associated with feelings like this. In UK schools, you are more likely to see &apos;effort reaps reward&apos;.&quot; It is reasonable to assume that we have been shown only the creme de la creme of China&apos;s schools. The Chinese education system has its faults, says Dr Ed Vickers, an expert on east Asian education at the Institute of Education, University of London. &quot;The elitist bent of Chinese government education policy over most of the past quarter-century has tended to favour &apos;key&apos; or &apos;model&apos; schools. There is a growing socio-economic inequality between coast and hinterland, urban and rural areas, the east and the poorer west.&quot; However, the Chinese government claims that in 2005, 95% of the country was able to have the nine years of education it says are compulsory from the age of six. It says this was a 10% increase from 2000. Vickers also criticises the Chinese government for promoting technological and scientific expertise, seen as directly contributing to economic growth, at the expense of more &quot;humanistic&quot; studies. So, aside from the fact that the Chinese system has some serious flaws and that we have seen the best of the best, what do British headteachers think our system could learn from China&apos;s top schools? &quot;In China, it seems that if there is a weakness in the system, they deliver an agenda to change it very quickly,&quot; says Rees. &quot;They trained their teachers in the New Goals reforms in just five days. Our wheels are slower to turn.&quot; Sarah Dignasse, headteacher of the Plume school, a comprehensive in Essex, is impressed at the variety of vocational courses. &quot;I think China has got it right with the emphasis on the occupational.&quot; Dignasse fears the new vocational diplomas, which will be introduced in UK schools and colleges from 2008, are not &quot;occupational enough&quot;. Michael Lock, headteacher of Combe Pafford school in Devon, which takes six- to 16-year-olds with special educational needs, agrees. &quot;The variety of courses the Chinese vocational school was offering shows that the country is to some extent ahead of us in terms of vocational training.&quot; Bernard Smith, headteacher of Four Dwellings high school, a community school and comprehensive in Birmingham, has been struck by the international perspective of the Chinese students he has met. &quot;I want to change my school so that my pupils think globally,&quot; he says. &quot;They are going to compete in a global world. If they think their opportunities are just within the UK, they are limiting themselves.&quot; Dignasse agrees: &quot;I want to find ways to make my students realise the world is bigger than they think. They are going to be competing for jobs in a global market and they need to understand just how many keen students their age there are.&quot; The British Council says the number of Chinese schools with links to British schools has more than doubled in the past three years, from 76 in 2005 to 162 now. &quot;China is opening its doors wide and wants to learn,&quot; says the principal of Xi&apos;an Railway Number One middle school. This is true in more ways than one. And we can learn from it, too. How the system works From six to 12, Chinese children attend primary school. At 12 they go to junior middle school, until 15. Their compulsory education is meant to end at 15. In poorer areas, it may end earlier. At 15, they take an exam and go to either a vocational school or the more academic senior high school, also sometimes called a middle school. Which university they go to will be determined by their score in the gaokao, the college entrance exam. China v England In China, there are 17.3 million pupils in primary schools, 50,000 pupils in special schools, 19.2 million in middle schools, 2.9 million in vocational schools and 8.7 million in senior high schools. In England, there are 7.3 million pupils in state primary and secondary schools, of whom 4.1 million are in primary schools and 3.5 million in secondary schools.

BT is paying a 33.9% premium to the one-month average share price of Frontline, which operates in China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. &quot;Frontline will bring to BT major new contracts in Asia,&quot; said Fran\u00e7ois Barrault, chief executive of BT&apos;s global services division. &quot;[It has] approximately 5,000 highly skilled and professional people whose reputation for delivering complex solutions and network management services fits perfectly with BT&apos;s strategy.&quot; The deal will also give BT a greater foothold in India. Under the deal, Frontline will buy an additional 9% of India&apos;s Accel Frontline to raise its stake in the Mumbai-listed firm to 51%. As call prices have shrunk and competition has driven down broadband charges, BT has been building up its non-retail businesses and expanding beyond the UK.

Photograph: Damian Dovarganes/AP Donald Trump, as they might say in some of Aberdeen&apos;s less salubrious pubs, has got the kind of face you would love to punch; well-fed, smug and, above all, imbued with infuriating sense of entitlement. Alas for those who find Trump irritating, there are laws against violence, so they must find alternative ways of venting their feelings against the world&apos;s most famous property developer. Many chose to make fun of his hair. Donald Trump has very funny hair. He also has a very funny way of doing business, which brings to the newest outlet for those who wish to vent against The Donald; his proposed development at Balmedie on Scotland&apos;s north-east coast, where he hopes to build a luxury hotel, 1,000 luxury homes and - hype alert - &quot;the world&apos;s greatest golf course&quot;. Inevitably, this proposed development has divided opinion in the north east and beyond. On balance, public opinion, especially, in the north east, is in favour, although what the minority lack in numbers, they more than make up for with volume of their opposition. Strangely, for a development that could have serious consequences for the Scottish economy, much of this opposition centres around Trump&apos;s personality and, indeed, his hair. But amid such silliness, there is more serious and semi-serious opposition, much of it centring around - at least from the perspective of the global media, which has become fascinated with this story - a local farmer called Michael Forbes, who, if he is not careful, might wake up one day to find himself being played by Donald Sutherland in the Hollywood version of this saga. Mr Forbes own a farm smack into the middle of Trump&apos;s proposed development site and, as he has told every media outlet from Singapore to Tucson, Arizona, he will not be moving under any circumstances. A far more low-key, and important, opponent is a local councillor called Martin Ford, the head of the Aberdeenshire council&apos;s infrastructure services committee, who cast his decisive vote at a meeting last week to reject Trump&apos;s plan on environmental grounds (it would be built on an area of special scientific interest). Ford&apos;s decision wrought several consequences, not least a spate a personal attacks based on his own lifestyle, which involves not owning a mobile phone and avoiding air travel because of its impact on global warming. Another consequence was the intervention of the Scottish Executive, which has taken the highly unusual step of &quot;calling in&quot; the planning proposal with a view to taking the ultimate decision on whether it goes ahead out of the hands of the council. Trump, meanwhile, has issued the latest of many ultimatums that have punctuated his conduct during this saga; give me what I want or I&apos;m off to Ireland. From the perspective of the watching world, this is all great fun: a &quot;cracking story&quot;, featuring a cast of outlandish characters. Fun, however, is not a luxury the local population can afford, at least not in this case. North Sea oil, which has sustained the north east&apos;s economy for 30 years, will run out one day. And when that day comes, what will be left? As things stand, not Donald Trump&apos;s \u00a31bn golfing paradise. On any sensible, dispassionate interpretation of modern economic development, that is the mistake that can&apos;t be allowed to stand. Trump may be a ludcrious figure, whose belligerent, counterproductive conduct over the last few months belies his reputation as a deal-maker supreme. But he must have his development. This question is how do we reach that conclusion. Compromise might sound like a killjoy&apos;s charter, but compromise there must be. Opponents such as Martin Ford and Michael Forbes are no doubt sincere, but they must be persuaded to place the greater good above their personal views. Meanwhile, Trump has to stop his silly grandstanding. He must admit that his proposal is, at its core, a property development and not a personal calling to build the &quot;world&apos;s greatest golf course&quot;, in which case he will then be able to steer his links away from the most environmentally sensitive areas of the local coastline. Most of all, he must work with the local population and not threaten them. And when he has finished doing all of that, he should nip into Aberdeen city centre where he will find many good barber shops."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/07/germany.kateconnolly", "sentences": ["Other big wheel projects are planned or currently being built in six Chinese cities, as well as Singapore, Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow and Orlando."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-07T13:07:54Z", "title": "Berlin follows London Eye with plans for giant ferris wheel", "tags": ["World news", "Germany", "Europe"], "article": "Berlin has announced it is planning to build a giant ferris wheel, becoming the latest in a spate of cities keen to define their power, status and prosperity with a grandiose amusement ride. The German capital is preparing to erect Europe&apos;s largest wheel with a height of 185 metres at a cost of slightly over \u00a385m, creating what Berlin&apos;s mayor, Klaus Wowereit, has insisted will become &quot;the city&apos;s trademark&quot;. Forget the Brandenburg Gate, the remnants of the Berlin Wall, Norman Foster&apos;s glass-dome topped Reichstag building or the imposing socialist-era television tower. It is, city officials hope, the 6,500 ton steel wheel which will help put Berlin - a city still struggling to shake off its Cold War yoke and realise its regained status as a capital - on the map. Concerns of animal experts that the lights of the wheel will disturb the sleeping patterns of nearby Berlin zoo&apos;s rhinoceros community, or of the Greens, who fear it will shift the city centre&apos;s focus too far westwards, have fallen on deaf ears. Made up of 36 gondolas, the wheel will take 1,500 people on a 35-minute round trip high above the rooftops of Berlin and is expected to attract two million visitors a year when it opens in the autumn of 2009. Berlin&apos;s project shows the extent to which the ferris wheel has rediscovered its place in the imagination as the new status symbol of cities across the globe. The frenzy is not dissimilar to that sparked by Pennsylvania bridge engineer George Ferris&apos;s 80 metre wheel, built for the World Exhibition of Chicago in 1893, which triggered a spate of copycat constructions, generally planned under the premise that bigger must mean better. The Great Berlin Wheel will be 50 metres higher than the London Eye, built in 1999, and will even tower over China&apos;s impressive Star of Nanchang by 25 metres. But despite German hopes that Berlin would boast the biggest wheel in the world, it faces the humiliating prospect of being dwarfed by a parallel project in Beijing, a 208 metre construction set to be ready in time for next year&apos;s Olympics. Other big wheel projects are planned or currently being built in six Chinese cities, as well as Singapore, Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow and Orlando. Berlin&apos;s project was inspired by the London Eye, which was originally built to stand for just five years but has become one of the city&apos;s leading tourist attractions. In an age in which speed, technology and sophistication are increasingly revered, the old fashioned metal wheel that does little more than turn slowly has done well to keep its place. &quot;The wheel is the perfect symbol for the 21st century,&quot; Gereon Asmuth wrote in a commentary for the German daily newspaper, Taz, in praise of the Berlin project. &quot;It is completely superficial ... a luxury, symbolising nothing and at the same time, embodying the very intoxication of being momentarily raised above this nothingness.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/dec/08/weekend7.weekend4", "sentences": ["Marguerite Cullen Thurlby, South Lincolnshire It is a rare delight to be able to say that Stephen Fry is wrong - China, South Korea, Australia, South Africa and even Singapore insist on putting com or co in between a web name and the country abbreviation (Dork Talk, December 1)."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-08T23:51:07Z", "title": "Letters", "tags": [], "article": "There is no need for a terrorist to take anything that may be a weapon through security (Heads In The Clouds, December 1).

Not born when New Order played Tokyo in 1985? Just turn to your &apos;I know the promoter, honest&apos; laptop. The truly great thing about the internet in 2007 is it not only gets us backstage, it allows us to travel in time. Via YouTube and MySpace, I&apos;ve seen Grace Jones strut her stuff at Studio 54, joined the Sex Pistols on their Jubilee boat trip on the Thames and watched Radiohead perform almost all of In Rainbows even before they offered it to me for nothing. Illegal downloading means that hardcore fans hear their favourite band&apos;s new album before the record company does. Punter file-sharing generosity means we can be part of a scene that ended before we were born. In 2007, like never before, everything you want from the world of pop is within your reach. (OK, not actual physical contact, but remember, that&apos;s how nasty germs are spread. Just ask indie boy mattress, sorry, mistress, Kate Moss.) The effects of such easy-access culture can be seen in young musicians. Having just judged the BBC World Service&apos;s Next Big Thing, an international competition to find new musical talent, I can report that there is a band in Singapore making Brazilian rock, a chap from the United Arab Emirates who sounds like Justin Timberlake doing Queen, some Latvians giving it the combined local forces of Radiohead and Blur. (Their names, pop swots? Wicked Aura, Jeremie Johnson, Axis.) For years, the guardians of rock&apos;s history have told a straightforwardly linear story, rather like the Kings and Queens of England. You know, blues begat rock&apos;n&apos;roll which begat pop ... blah blah until Britpop and then jump straight to the Libertines. A tale that ignored all the uncool stuff around the edges. You&apos;d never get a section on Depeche Mode, let alone Take That. But when, earlier this year, I interviewed Sasha from ace Parisian babe-rockers Second Sex, he reported, straight-faced, that, &apos;I&apos;m not a big fan of the Libertines and the Strokes. In fact, I like Motown, the blues, Springsteen, Dire Straits.&apos; Either the man&apos;s an accountant in disguise, or he&apos;s yet to be corrupted by a stuck-in-their-ways adult&apos;s idea of right and wrong. Many of the most interesting new bands have the same attitude: true pop socialists - everything is equal - who don&apos;t give two hoots for ye olde rock lore. Such as Late of the Pier, who manage to channel Gary Numan and Siouxsie and the Banshees with the weirdest of pre-school singalongs; Foals - Talking Heads meets ACR. The eclecticism of CSS, and Hot Chip, we all know about already. That last sentence shows the flipside to this inspiring situation. Now that getting to see Mantronix playing &apos;Who Is It?&apos; in a church in Newcastle is actually easier than getting out of the house, our interest becomes harder to sustain. Our access to everything means our attention span is minimal. We&apos;re all teenagers now: world-weary about &apos;back in the day&apos;, meaning winter 2005. Such speed can be unhelpful for artists. By the time the Klaxons put Myths of the Near Future out, it seemed as though they&apos;d been here for years. Duffy and Adele, two great female singer/songwriters at the start of their careers, are forced not only to tip their hats to elder stateswoman Lily Allen, but to come up with the goods now now now. Not to worry. For a start, if you love music, you&apos;re like a toddler with too many presents and that can&apos;t be a bad thing, really. If you don&apos;t, there&apos;s always the supermarket CD route: just ignore all the goodies out there, and buy whatever Tesco recommends. And if you&apos;re the kind of music snob that likes to stay ahead of the pack, then your build-em-up-knock-em-down time-slot has reduced to mere weeks.

The bank&apos;s dramatic write-down and profit warning, a day ahead of an investor conference in London, could send shock waves through markets which expect more financial houses to disclose substantial full-year losses because of the ensuing credit crunch.

The bank said it would also resell treasury shares it had bought to cancel, bringing in a further $2bn in capital, and replace its 2007 cash dividend with a stock dividend, bringing in a total of CHF19.4bn to shore up its capital base. Rohner said later other investors had expressed interest in moving in and did not rule out further participation by Singapore and the Middle East investor. The October writedown meant UBS posted a net loss of CHF830m in the third quarter, its first quarterly loss in nine years.

Nevertheless, it is important to always maintain a notably strong capital position to support the continued growth of our wealth management business, which is the largest generator of value to UBS shareholders.&quot; Rohner later told a conference call that UBS still has exposures to the sub-prime and related markets of $30bn, including $13bn in senior debt and collateral debt obligations (CDOs) but insisted that the bank had carried out a thorough, conservative estimate of the write-downs involved - given the worsening market decisions from mid-November.  &quot;Our situation looks much better than last Friday and risk has been substantially reduced,&quot; he said after an emergency board meeting over the weekend. Ospel said he had come under no internal pressure to resign while Rohner said he had no intention of taking a bonus this year.

That was the pitch from UBS yesterday as the Swiss bank found itself with the dubious distinction of being the bank with the second-biggest loss related to sub-prime US mortgages. Amazingly, UBS found a receptive audience. Its shares gained as $10bn was added to its previous estimate of sub-prime losses from $3.4bn. That estimate was only two months old. An outsider might ask why, if UBS didn&apos;t know what was going on October, its numbers should be trusted now. The answer, it seems, is that some serious financial institutions have been persuaded that the picture is as bleak as it will get. So the Singapore government and a Middle Eastern investor that prefers anonymity (this is Switzerland) are putting up $11.5bn. Good luck to them: they are investing in a bank that perpetually finds itself at the heart of great financial cock-ups. Last time it was Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that blew up in 1998. Conservatism after the catastrophe is one thing; if UBS actually lived by its supposed caution it wouldn&apos;t get into these scrapes in the first place. The price UBS investors are paying is extraordinary: their dividend will be paid in shares, not cash; previously cancelled shares will be reissued; and the Singaporeans and their unnamed co-travellers could end up owning 12% of the bank. Every sinew is being strained to avoid a rights issue or a dividend cut. In reality, it&apos;s still a $17bn fund-raising. In the circumstances, don&apos;t count on yesterday&apos;s warm market reaction being the final word. Yes, it&apos;s reassuring that, as at Citigroup, overseas investors are prepared to send bundles of cash to support the west&apos;s banking system. But no, it&apos;s not reassuring that a loss of $3.4bn can become $13.4bn so quickly. It suggests other banks will have to revisit their sub-prime exposures and that the bad news will flow for months yet. Rio grand Anything seems possible in the mining industry these days, but a break-up bid for Rio Tinto? Blackstone, the US private equity group, distanced itself from the idea yesterday, but that may not be the end of the matter. Every small piece of news from China - where local steelmakers are up in arms about the prospect of a BHP Billiton bid for Rio - is taken as evidence of plans being drawn up. We will discover today if the suspension of trading in the shares of Baosteel, China&apos;s biggest steelmaker, is a red herring or not, but it&apos;s worth considering what it would take to consume Rio. For a start, the price would have to beat anything that BHP, which has its eye on synergies, could offer. It would have to satisfy the Australian government, which is probably even more protectionist than it was when it blocked Shell&apos;s bid for local oil group Woodside. An outsider, like a Blackstone-China consortium, would also have to pay cash. Raising $200bn in today&apos;s markets would be next to impossible, surely. If the plan was to break Rio into pieces, the buyer would be taking an immense bet that metals prices stay firm. So are the rumours just fanciful? Who knows, but it&apos;s very helpful for Rio that sky-high valuations are being thrown around. BHP is struggling to be heard. The collier to watch We spent last year getting used to the idea that UK Coal, the country&apos;s largest coal producer, should be valued as a property stock rather than a miner. The notion was not so silly because the company thinks its property and land could be worth \u00a3900m in 2012 if it wins various planning consents to redevelop 50,000 brownfield acres. It also did wonders for the share price, which jumped from 200p to 600p. It is now nearer 400p, thanks to falling values of commercial property, so yesterday was a good day for UK Coal to remind us that it is still in the business of digging for the black stuff. A deal to supply EDF Energy with 4m tonnes from 2009 to 2012 extends the life of the Thoresby colliery in Nottinghamshire and saves 500 jobs. Investors are more interested in the financials since the EDF deal, like two others in recent months, is best viewed as part of UK Coal&apos;s liberation from fixed-price contracts it signed years ago when the price of coal was on the floor. Few hard numbers are available, but we may guess that yesterday&apos;s deal, given that the spot price of coal has doubled in the past year, has a present value of at least \u00a3100m. At a company with a market value of \u00a3650m, that&apos;s chunky.

BP, under its former chief executive, John Browne, promised to go &quot;beyond petroleum&quot; while Shell has spent millions advertising its serious interest in the future of the environment. But at a time when interest in solar power is greater than ever, with the world&apos;s first &quot;solar city&quot; being built at Phoenix, Arizona, a small announcement from Environ Energy Global of Singapore revealed that it had bought Shell&apos;s photovoltaic operations in India and Sri Lanka, with more than 260 staff and 28 offices, for an undisclosed sum. The sell-off, to be followed by similar ones in the Philippines and Indonesia, comes after another major disposal executed in a low-key way last year, when Shell hived off its solar module production business. The division, with 600 staff and manufacturing plants in the US, Canada and Germany, went to Munich-based SolarWorld. Shell has however formed a manufacturing link, with Saint-Gobain, and promised to build one plant in Germany. The Anglo-Dutch oil group confirmed yesterday that it had pulled out of its rural business in India and Sri Lanka, saying it was not making enough money.  &quot;It was not bringing in any profit for us there so we transferred it to another operator. The buyer will be able to take it to the next level,&quot; said a spokeswoman at Shell headquarters in London. The oil group said it was continuing to move its renewables interests into a mainstream business and hoped to find one new power source that would &quot;achieve materiality&quot; for it. Shell continues to invest in a number of wind farm schemes, such as the London Array offshore scheme, which has government approval. Shell has also been concentrating its efforts on biofuels, but declined to say whether it had given up on solar power even though many smaller rivals continue to believe the technology has a bright future. Environmental groups have always accused Shell of using clean energy initiatives as &quot;greenwash&quot; to deflect criticism from its core carbon operations, especially tar sands. The latest pull-out has annoyed rival business leaders at London-based Solar Century and local Indian operation, Orb Energy, who fear the impact of a high-profile company selling off solar business. Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of Solarcentury and a leading voice in renewable energy circles, said Shell was undermining the credibility of the business world in its fight against global warming. &quot;Shell and Solar Century were among the 150 companies that recently signed up to the hard-hitting Bali Declaration. It is vital that companies act consistently with the rhetoric in such declarations, and as I have told Shell senior management on several occasions, an all-out assault on the Canadian tar sands and extracting oil from coal is completely inconsistent with climate protection. &quot;This latest evidence of half-heartedness or worse in Shell&apos;s renewables activities leaves me even more disappointed. Unless fossil-fuel energy companies evolve their core activities meaningfully, we are in deep trouble,&quot; he said.  Damian Miller, former director of Shell Solar&apos;s rural operations and now chief executive of Orb Energy, said Shell was missing an opportunity by pulling out at a time when renewables markets were starting to mature in the developing world. He alleged some customers were complaining of being abandoned by Shell and worried about the servicing of equipment they could expect from Environ. &quot;We see former Shell customers who are highly disappointed not to be receiving proper service for the solar systems they have invested in. These customers have often invested 20-30% of their annual income in a system to ensure they have some minimum amount of lighting and access to radio, TV, or a fan,&quot; said Miller. He added that the oil majors, including Shell, had invested time and energy in promoting their plans for renewable energy in the press and on TV, but were not able to lead the transformation the world needs towards renewable energy and energy efficient solutions.  Shell declined to comment on these criticisms or talk about where its priorities lay. But the chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, did make a number of comments last summer which could have paved the way for a change in policy. Alternative energy sources such as renewables will not fill the gap, he argued, forecasting that even with technological breakthroughs they could give supply only 30% of global energy by the middle of the century. &quot;Contrary to public perceptions, renewable energy is not the silver bullet that will soon solve all our problems,&quot; he said.  Meanwhile, BP has been accused by Greenpeace Canada of lining itself up to help commit &quot;the biggest environmental crime in history&quot;. This follows its decision to swap assets with Husky Oil, giving it an entrance ticket to the Alberta tar sands, which are said to be five times more energy-intensive to extract compared to traditional oil. John Browne, the group&apos;s former chief executive, had said BP would not follow Shell into tar sands as he established an alternative energy division and pledged to take the group &quot;beyond petroleum.&quot; The new boss, Tony Hayward, has pointed the corporate supertanker in a new direction although his public relations minders insist BP remains committed to exploring the potential of renewables. &quot;Tony Hayward has been part of the management team at BP for many years and has endorsed the low-carbon strategy that involved BP creating its alternative energy business late in 2005. We are spending $8bn (\u00a34bn) over ten years and are pressing ahead with 450 megawatts of wind production capacity in the US,&quot; said a spokesman. &quot;The tar sands deal in Canada does not represent a change in direction, it was just a very good opportunity which represents a broadening of the portfolio.&quot; Greenpeace climate campaigner Joss Garman said: &quot;If Shell is to survive the climate change age... it needs to become not just an oil company but an energy company. One wonders if Shell&apos;s executives have noticed what&apos;s happening in Bali or if we&apos;ll see slick adverts on TV boasting about their retreat from renewables. Probably not.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/dec/11/bbcworldserviceseriesonpr", "sentences": ["But 40% said it was more important to maintain social harmony and peace, even if it meant curbing press freedom.p&gt; In India, Singapore and Russia, by contrast, more people favoured stability over press freedom."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-11T17:18:53Z", "title": "BBC World Service series on press freedom marks its 75th anniversary", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "Press freedom", "BBC World Service"], "article": " Press freedom may appear to be a straightforward concept - but it defies easy definition, even within the liberal democracies that proclaim its enjoyment. Seen from a global perspective, press freedom is a relative term, differing in degree from country to country.   In those countries where it exists by virtue of a written constitution or a bill of rights, or by parliamentary custom or legal precedent, its boundaries are continually being tested - sometimes by debate, sometimes through the law. In totalitarian states where there is no political freedom, press freedom remains an ambition yet to be realised.    This is the opening to a piece I wrote to mark the BBC World Service&apos;s 75th anniversary, which appears in the December 2007 issue of BBC World Agenda magazine. It is also a sort of mission statement for a four-part series I&apos;m presenting for the World Service entitled &quot;Press For Freedom&quot;. Part one will be broadcast tomorrow (Wednesday). The times differ depending on where you are in the world. In Europe, the three starting times are 09.06, 12.06 and 20.06, and you might catch it on the BBC Radio 4 overnight. The first part deals specifically with state control, looking at the problems in Russia, Zimbabwe and Iraq. It considers the effects of government control and at the risks that journalists are willing to take in order to pursue the truth. In Russia, journalists talk about their murdered colleague Anna Politkovskaya. In South Africa, Peta Thornycroft talks about the acute difficulties of reporting from Zimbabwe. I also meet Wilf Mbanga, who is forced to edit The Zimbabwean from Britain. In Iraq, the brave young journalist Ali Fedhil describes the constant danger of trying to report anything at all, either inside the country or outside. Programmes in future weeks will look at the impact of the internet, the role of radio in building democracy and the threats to press freedom within established liberal democracies. Journalists tend to believe that people everywhere share their own desire for press freedom, but a poll conducted by the World Service has shown that the public is not as enthusiastic about it as we might like to think. Opinion is very divided. Of those interviewed 11,344 people in 14 countries), 56% thought that freedom of the press was very important to ensure a free society. But 40% said it was more important to maintain social harmony and peace, even if it meant curbing press freedom.p&gt; In India, Singapore and Russia, by contrast, more people favoured stability over press freedom. In those countries, around 48% of respondents supported controls over the press to ensure peace and stability. Here&apos;s the rub. In some developed countries which strongly believed in press freedom, people were critical of their own media&apos;s honesty and accuracy. In the US, Britain and Germany, only around 29% of those interviewed thought their media did a good job in reporting news accurately. If we are to defend press freedom, therefore, journalists have to gain - or regain - the trust of the people they claim to serve.

The move could prompt rivals to further disclosure of writedowns and depressed full-year earnings since it applies a very conservative valuation to UBS&apos;s sub-prime holdings. But after an initial plunge, UBS shares closed up 1.4% after the bank raised 13bn Swiss francs (\u00a35.6bn) in fresh capital, with SFr11bn from the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC, and the remainder from an undisclosed Middle East investor, believed to be Oman. The Omanis denied this and UBS said the investor wished to remain anonymous. Abu Dhabi, the Gulf state, recently injected $7.5bn (\u00a33.7bn) into Citigroup, the US bank also hit by the sub-prime crisis. Analysts said the moves pointed to an accelerating trend that could see more sovereign wealth funds take significant stakes in vulnerable US and European banks whose stock had plunged. Tony Tan, deputy chairman of GIC, which will hold 9% of UBS, insisted that his fund did not seek control of the company or even a seat on the board. It is GIC&apos;s largest investment in a single firm.  UBS has already written down $3.4bn and issued a profit warning. Marcel Rohner, the chief executive, admitted that it was &quot;now possible&quot; the bank, which lost SFr830m in the third quarter, could face a net full-year loss. He said the US mortgage and housing markets had deteriorated sharply since mid-November and the scale of the writedowns would &quot;create maximum clarity on this issue and will have the effect of substantially eliminating speculation&quot;.  Asked on a conference call whether UBS could be forced into further writedowns, he said: &quot;I guess we should leave it to observers to come up with their own views of what the worst-case exposure is. We believe that the current level of the market is at distress level.&quot; The bank said it would also re-sell shares it had bought to cancel, bringing in a further $2bn in capital, and replace its 2007 cash dividend with a stock dividend, bringing in a total of SFr19.4bn to shore up its capital base.  The bank said yesterday&apos;s measures would boost its tier-one capital ratio above 12%. &quot;Our losses in the US mortgage securities market are substantial but could have been absorbed by our earnings and capital base,&quot; said Marcel Ospel, UBS&apos;s chairman. &quot;Nevertheless, it is important to always maintain a notably strong capital position to support the continued growth of our wealth management business, which is the largest generator of value to UBS shareholders.&quot;  He added: &quot;We want to be among the best-capitalised banks and this puts us in a position to absorb any future shocks, but we are not acting out of fear.&quot; Rohner said that UBS still had exposures to the sub-prime and related markets of $30bn, including $13bn in senior debt and collateralised debt obligations. &quot;Our situation looks much better than last Friday and risk has been substantially reduced,&quot; he said after an emergency board meeting over the weekend.  Ospel said he had come under no internal pressure to resign and Rohner said he had no intention of taking a bonus this year. The chief executive insisted that though the investment banking arm would have to be repositioned and would need to shed some business, it would be retained and other parts of the group, especially wealth management, were performing at or near record levels.  The investment bank is cutting 1,500 jobs early next year but Rohner ruled out any further job losses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/12/creditcrunch.ftse", "sentences": ["Kelda, however, could be a short-lived member of the FTSE 100 - it has already recommended a \u00a33bn bid from a consortium including Singapore investment group GIC, HSBC, Infracapital Partners and Prudential."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-12T01:45:31Z", "title": "Credit crunch causes FTSE 100 shake-out", "tags": ["Credit crunch", "Business", "FTSE"], "article": "The FTSE 100 index will today see its biggest shake-up since the era of the dotcom boom and bust. In all, seven companies are expected to drop out of the leading index this month, including the battered mortgage bank Northern Rock. This is the biggest number of changes at one time since eight companies left the top flight in September 2001, when ironically Northern Rock was replacing one of those. The record number of entrants to the FTSE 100 was 10, in March 2000. The 2001 index changes signalled the bursting of the technology bubble, with the departure of such names as Carlton Communications, Misys, CMG, Colt Telecom, Telewest, Energis, Spirent and Marconi. Many of today&apos;s expected departures are losing their place as a result of the US sub-prime crisis and the subsequent credit crunch. Northern Rock is of course the most prominent victim of the funding difficulties that followed the US problems. At one point the bank was on course to leave the ranks of Britain&apos;s top 350 companies altogether and be relegated straight to the small-cap arena. But the continuing hope of a takeover has supported its shares enough to avoid that ignominious fate, despite another 4.66% fall yesterday to 104.4p. It will now drop into the FTSE 250. Barratt Developments, the housebuilder, has been hit by the weakness of the housing market. Last week&apos;s interest rate cut and an 8.25p rise to 485.75p yesterday on vague speculation of a French bid were not enough to save it from departing the leading index. Mitchells &amp; Butler, up 7.75p to 507p, was another victim of the credit crunch, which forced it to abandon a proposed property joint venture with entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz. Its shares have fallen on fears that Tchenguiz may sell his stake in the business, even though that has been consistently denied. More prosaically, beer sales have disappointed after the smoking ban, and there are growing fears that consumers will keep their wallets in their pockets. For similar reasons, rival pub group Punch Taverns, 11p higher at 838p yesterday, is poised to join M&amp;B in the FTSE 250. Also hit by worries about consumer spending is DSG International, the former Dixons group and owner of the electrical chain Currys. Tate &amp; Lyle, which has issued a number of profit warnings, and Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, whose recent results disappointed, are the final two to be demoted from the top 100. Due to take their places are perennial bid target Cairn Energy, Yorkshire Water owner Kelda, bus and train operator First Group, holiday companies Thomas Cook and Tui Travel, security business G4S and insurer Admiral. Kelda, however, could be a short-lived member of the FTSE 100 - it has already recommended a \u00a33bn bid from a consortium including Singapore investment group GIC, HSBC, Infracapital Partners and Prudential.

As UBS welcomed its biggest shareholder - Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, which is taking 9% of the overstretched Swiss bank - Lafarge, the French cement maker, splashed out \u20ac10.2bn to take over Egypt&apos;s Orascom in a deal that will see Nassef Sawiris, Orascom&apos;s head, inject some \u20ac2.8bn for an 11.4% stake in the purchaser and two seats on the board. Lafarge, headed by Bruno Lafont since January 2006, is betting the shop on emerging markets - not just the Mediterranean Basin and Middle East (Egypt, Algeria, UAE, Iraq, Saudi Arabia et al) and the construction boom fuelled by oil and gas. The deal will take it as far as South Africa and Nigeria as well as Pakistan and even North Korea. More to the point, it will see Lafarge&apos;s operating earnings two-thirds dependent on emerging markets by 2010 and they will account for 90m tonnes of the 260m tonnes Lafarge expects to produce by then. Lafont, a man in a hurry (he rapidly sold off the roofing business) but a strong believer in sustainable development, says the deal will boost earnings from year one and bring \u20ac150m in cost-savings. He is now promising a virtual doubling in earnings per share to \u20ac15 by 2010 when the return on capital will have jumped to 12%. It will, he says, &quot;decisively accelerate the transformation of the group&quot; into the global leader ahead of Holcim and Cemex. But Lafarge, which is issuing \u20ac6bn of new debt to help finance the deal and taking on Orascom&apos;s \u20ac1.4bn debt, is also betting that the Egyptian business will continue to deliver stellar earnings. With 10 brand-new plants and several others under construction, Orascom is expected to post operating earnings of $1.3bn on sales of $2.6bn in 2008 or an operating margin of 50% (three times Lafarge&apos;s own) and see annual sales growth of 30% and profits growth of 33% between now and 2010. Reassuringly for Lafont, his globalised vision is, by all accounts, shared by the Belgian baron, Albert Fr\u00e8re, who had built up a 17.4% stake in Lafarge and, though that share will be diluted with Orascom&apos;s entry, will gain three seats on the board for his investment vehicle GBL. But shares in OCI, Orascom&apos;s parent, sank more than 6% in Cairo on Tuesday as Egyptian investors labelled the deal lousy for them. Island hopping Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president who memorably asked at June&apos;s EU summit what competition has ever done for Europe but has staked his future on reforming France, could be heading for a new showdown with the European commission over state aids. The fact that it involves the ever-fractious island of Corsica adds more than piquancy to the issue: it could provoke a rerun of the 2005 strikes by the communist-led CGT union that blockaded Marseilles for several weeks and brought riots to the island. It&apos;s a highly complex case but one fraught with political sensitivities and a test of the commission&apos;s resolve to put competition and consumer rights at the heart of its own strategy for reforming the EU. And the sensitivities are heightened by the fact that it is being decided by Jacques Barrot, transport commissioner, ex-labour minister under Sarko&apos;s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, and former chairman of Sarko&apos;s UMP in the French national assembly - rather than the doughty Neelie Kroes, competition commissioner. It pitches the part-privatised SNCM, the operating running services between Marseilles against Corsica&apos;s five main ports, including Bastia and Ajaccio, and family-owned Corsica Ferries which operates ferries from Nice and Toulon to the island as well as from Italy to Sardinia and, recently, in Greece. (It also provided ships for the defunct Newhaven-Dieppe service from 2001 to 2006.) The commission is due to decide on the case within the next few weeks but may - political sensitivities again - delay it until after France&apos;s municipal elections in March when Marseilles will be a huge battleground. Pierre Mattei, Corsica Ferries chief executive, in town to lobby the commission, has lodged two complaints with it: one concerning SNCM&apos;s shareholder structure and another its alleged abuse of dominance. His hope is that Barrot and his colleagues will consider this as a single whole but his fear is that politics will win the day. In its 2005 privatisation SNCM was eventually handed over to Veolia and Butler Capital but the French state retained a 25% stake and a further 9% was given to employees, members of the militant CGT union that staged last month&apos;s transport strikes. Mattei says that the deal was conditional on SNCM winning the renewed concession to operate ferries between the island and Marseilles from 2007 to 2013 and on commission clearance of around \u20ac280m in &quot;restructuring&quot; aid. If the commission says no, he adds, Veolia will walk away from SNCM - and Sarko will be forced to renationalise it. (Brussels cleared earlier aid of \u20ac76m for SNCM but the Court of First Instance, Europe&apos;s second highest court, annulled that in 2005 and any fresh commission decision will have to be &quot;bullet-proof&quot; in the courts). Mattei also claims that the terms of the contract to operate ferries between Corsica and Marseilles was &quot;tailor-made&quot; for SNCM and made it nigh-impossible for his firm to compete: heavily subsidised fares for the incumbent operator which supplied gross over-estimates of passenger numbers, impossible deadlines to provide services, restrictions on types of ferries etc. (The initial tendering process was ruled out of order by the French state council). For both sides the stakes are very high, with Corsica Ferries, pitching itself as a &quot;low-cost carrier of the sea,&quot; seeing \u20ac300m of investment in new ships at risk. &quot;A state monopoly is one thing but a private one is worse,&quot; grimaces Mattei. Given those political sensitivities, it&apos;s a moot point whether Barrot and his colleagues will share his view."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/dec/13/wallstreetjournal.rupertmurdoch", "sentences": ["The Singapore Straits Times, the Jakarta Post and News Corp titles the Australian and the Melbourne Herald Sun will also carry the ad."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-13T18:57:37Z", "title": "Rupert Murdoch blitzes the world's press with Wall Street Journal advert", "tags": ["Wall Street Journal", "Rupert Murdoch", "News Corporation", "Dow Jones", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "US press and publishing", "Business"], "article": "Rupert Murdoch will celebrate News Corporation&apos;s acquisition of the Wall Street Journal with a $2m (\u00a3981,000) advertising blitz in newspapers around the world tomorrow.

London&apos;s Southwark crown court heard that during their &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; crime spree, the gang toured the capital with a shopping list of top-of-the-range models. Once targets had been identified, keys were later stolen during burglaries, or false documents and names used to obtain copies from overseas dealers. The cars, worth up to \u00a3350,000 each, were then driven away, given new identities by a &quot;master forger&quot;, and exported in a scam reminiscent of Nicolas Cage&apos;s hit film Gone in 60 Seconds. Most of the cars ended up in Maastricht and Antwerp in Holland, before being delivered to the United Arab Emirates. A few went to Singapore and South Africa. The court heard Palmer-Tomkinson&apos;s \u00a350,000 BMW 645 convertible was spotted outside her London home and its details recorded on a mobile phone. A forged car logbook and bogus passport were then used to get a &quot;replacement&quot; key from a Stuttgart dealer. The high-powered vehicle was later found at Birmingham City airport. Some of the socialite&apos;s personal possessions - including correspondence and a jeweller&apos;s receipt - were subsequently discovered on the coffee table of gang leader Imran Ganchi, 29. In a statement after the case, Palmer-Tomkinson said police had been &quot;extremely supportive&quot; after the theft of her car and possessions. &quot;They are to be congratulated on their efforts in finding my stolen car and successfully apprehending the gang responsible for stealing it,&quot; she said. The court heard Palmer-Tomkinson&apos;s BMW was just one of six recovered of the 34 stolen by the gang during its slick three-and-a-half year crime spree. The others remain with unidentified new owners, most of whom apparently paid &quot;near market value&quot; for them. They include dozens of Porsches, Mercedes, Range Rovers, Toyota Land Cruisers, and one \u00a3350,000 SLR McLaren supercar, which police believe was the first of its type stolen in England. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Testar said: &quot;The economic damage caused by these offences is very great, notwithstanding or perhaps because of the fact that the people from whom the vehicles are stolen are insured.&quot; He said the criminal operation owed much of its success to the work of a master forger, and told Ganchi that as the ringleader: &quot;You chose the path of rich pickings from dishonesty and chose it very, very soon after having been released from a sentence for something similar. &quot;The stakes were high and you knew it,&quot; he added. Apart from the socialite, owners targeted included diplomats, the &quot;head of Al Jazeera television&quot;, and a number of unnamed &quot;high profilers&quot;. The court heard the thieves, convinced they were untouchable, videoed themselves at the wheel during their heists. One mobile phone clip showed 21-year-old Yusef Kaduji apparently trying to verify the 208mph McLaren&apos;s claimed 3.6 second 0-60 time. Although the &quot;used value&quot; of the stolen cars was over \u00a31.5 million, the final tally would have approached \u00a32.5 million had the gang remained free to honour its bulging order book. The mastermind, Ganchi, a father-of-two with addresses in Mellows Road and Rachel Close, Ilford, Essex, was jailed for six years; Kaduji, of Jephson Road, Forest Gate, east London, got two years; forger Hameed Nawaz, 31, of Ivy Road, Luton, Bedforshire received three years; and Shazad Hussain, 31, of Springford Road, Moseley, Birmingham, was given four years. A fifth gang member, Shakeel Shoukat, 21, of Central Park Road, Forest Gate, was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, with a tagging and curfew requirement. They variously admitted conspiracies involving car thefts and money laundering between June 1 2003 and January 1 this year. Hussain also asked for the handling of two stolen Mercedes SL500s and a Toyota Land Cruiser to be considered. Kaduji made a similar request involving an Aston Martin. Francis Sheridan, prosecuting, told the court the gang&apos;s &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; enterprise was stopped after a two-year police investigation called Operation Interspace. The operation was launched after the police were contacted by Dutch counterparts and handed recordings of coded telephone calls between Dutch &quot;criminal&quot; Frans Wolters and Ganchi about shipping stolen cars. Ganchi&apos;s Rachel Close home was later searched and an Aladdin&apos;s Cave of evidence recovered - forged logbooks, fake vehicle ID stickers, number plate making machines, hundreds of blank number plates and eight stolen British passports. Police later found Palmer-Tomkinson&apos;s car and one of the stolen Mercedes&apos; parked at Birmingham City Airport with false number plates. Nawaz&apos;s home was also raided. Hundreds of &quot;high quality&quot; forged documents were found along with fake logbooks, insurance certificates, invoices and utility bills. Case officer Detective Constable Ian Slaney said officers were now trying to trace the huge profits made by the gang. He said: &quot;These cars were sold abroad so it is only right the money is also overseas. All the evidence we have shows those involved lived modest lives, clearly to avoid detection.&quot; A confiscation hearing will be held later. Outside court, Detective Inspector Nick Linfoot, head of the Met&apos;s stolen vehicle unit, said: &quot;This is not a victimless crime. Apart from the financial loss to the insurance companies and knock-on costs to customers, the victims whose cars were stolen also had their personal belongings taken from inside the cars, undoubtedly increasing the stress, inconvenience and intrusion they felt.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/16/comment.economy", "sentences": ["Last week Citigroup, the world&apos;s biggest bank, sold a share stake to the Abu Dhabi government to raise desperately needed funds; Barclays has sold a stake to the Chinese government; the Swiss bank UBS a stake to the Singapore government."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-16T00:18:23Z", "title": "Will Hutton: Beware those who would bail us out of this chaos", "tags": ["Economic policy", "Politics", "UK news", "Credit crunch", "Economics", "Business"], "article": "The 1920s and 2000s are eerily similar decades. Both were characterised by extravagant wealth, extraordinarily cavalier lending by banks and hubristic over-optimism that the world had changed. The 1920s boom transmuted into slump when the American banking system collapsed. The question is whether a similar fate awaits us today. I offer the question because it&apos;s being posed by the West&apos;s most senior central bankers. Last week the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss and Canadian central banks simultaneously injected some \u00a350 billion of cash into their beleaguered banking systems. It is the outward signal of their profound private concern, as I have learned from those making the decisions. Central bankers are a curious breed. They usually remain above the financial fray but get their hands dirty when it matters. They are trackers in the financial jungle, picking up signals and sounds that mere mortals simply do not. What is spooking them is that despite differing reactions to the credit crisis, all face a continuing and deepening crisis in their interbank markets - the markets in which big banks lend billions to each other. This, I&apos;m told, was top of the agenda at a meeting in Cape Town some weeks ago when last week&apos;s intervention was first mooted. For two decades western banks have expanded their lending far ahead of the growth in the western economy, and acutely in Britain and the US. That has led to crazy lending on the high street. Infamously,the American sub-prime mortgage market now faces up to $300bn of potential loan write-offs. That may sound like a lot of money, and indeed it is, but it is less than the annual profits of North American and European banks. They should have been able to take the hit in their stride. The evidence is that they have not. The growing fear among central bankers is that the system has over-reached itself, rather as the US banks did in the 1920s. Paul Tucker, the Bank of England&apos;s executive director for financial markets, last week gave a window into their thinking when he described the risk of a &apos;feedback loop&apos; between the financial markets and real economy that could create a downward economic spiral. As banks retrenched, so the economy would get weaker - forcing another round of bank retrenchment and subsequent economic weakness. Make no mistake, there are banks fighting for their lives. To find capital, they are turning to the only organisations with sufficient funds - the state investment companies in the Gulf and Asia fattened by high oil prices and vast foreign exchange reserves. Last week Citigroup, the world&apos;s biggest bank, sold a share stake to the Abu Dhabi government to raise desperately needed funds; Barclays has sold a stake to the Chinese government; the Swiss bank UBS a stake to the Singapore government. They are the first of many. The financial crisis could prompt the partial takeover of the western banking system by Arab and Asian governments. I know at least one central banker who spent the summer reading JK Galbraith&apos;s Great Crash. The first task of President Franklin D Roosevelt after his election in 1932 was the recapitalisation of the bankrupt American banks by new public agencies - which his Republican critics decried as socialism. But it pulled the US out of slump. Unless the western interbank markets start functioning again soon, the question will arise as to which governments are going to bail the western banks out of their foolishness. Will it be our own - or that of Mr Hu Jintao and the potentates of various oil producing Arab states? Thus the conversation in Cape Town. Ominously, the first reaction to last week&apos;s injection of funds was a sell-off in the stock markets, but by Friday there were hopes that it might have delivered some short-term relief. The British government should be heeding central bankers&apos; concerns. It should be publicly announcing pre-emptive plans to support distressed mortgage holders and distressed lenders. It should be recasting the system of financial regulation, so that banks become tightly regulated, like utilities, as a quid pro quo for government guarantees of their deposits. Banks and building societies should be required to be much less reckless in their lending. The bill providing for the nationalisation of Northern Rock should be widened to include the other banks that will require short-term assistance. The UK should be pressing for a proper system of international financial governance and regulation. All that requires some conviction - which is in chronically short supply. New Labour in office has consistently genuflected to the City&apos;s interests, allowing itself to be bullied into making breathtaking regulatory and tax concessions, and thus colluding in the financial frenzy. Now it must change gear - and fast. Or risk the recession that the central bankers fear."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/16/subprimecrisis.creditcrunch", "sentences": ["A $7.5bn chunk of Citigroup has been sold to an investment vehicle controlled by the United Arab Emirates, while UBS, the Swiss banking group, has accepted a cash injection from the government of Singapore and an unnamed Middle Eastern fund worth more than $11.5bn, through the sale of convertible bonds."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-16T23:38:35Z", "title": "Foreign bidders pounce on suffering Wall Street", "tags": ["Business", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Credit crunch", "Banking", "US economy", "US news"], "article": "Foreign investors are swooping on Wall Street, buying up chunks of America&apos;s biggest banks to take advantage of the damage wreaked by the sub-prime crisis and the credit crunch. While the big banks are suffering from the effects of the over-investment in risky mortgage backed debt, outsiders are jumping at the chance to own a stake in the financial heart of America. A $7.5bn chunk of Citigroup has been sold to an investment vehicle controlled by the United Arab Emirates, while UBS, the Swiss banking group, has accepted a cash injection from the government of Singapore and an unnamed Middle Eastern fund worth more than $11.5bn, through the sale of convertible bonds. UBS plans to sell another $2bn-worth of shares, with the same Asian and Middle Eastern investors likely buyers. So far UBS and Citigroup have been hardest hit by the sub-prime and credit crises, and their balance sheets have become severely undercapitalised. In an effort to put the mess behind them, they have declared billions upon billions of dollars of asset write-downs in the hope that no more shocks will crop up in the coming months.  To move on from the crises effectively, however, the banks need financial support from institutions that have the means to dig in for the long haul - and that means giving away ownership. Most big investors in the west - such as mutual funds and local governments - are also feeling the pain of the credit crunch and so are unable to commit to the scale of rescue package needed by the likes of UBS and Citigroup. Therefore, sovereign funds in the oil-rich Middle East - and their equivalents in Asia, where the sub-prime crisis has failed to penetrate - are the only option. Wall Street analysts now believe that other big banks and brokerages are also looking to outsiders to help shore up their balance sheets. &apos;If the crisis continues or gets worse, banks will probably seek more investment in this form,&apos; said Frank Braden, banking analyst at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s in New York. While the ownership of big stakes in financial institutions by foreign or sovereign investors alters nothing in the way that banks are run, it has the potential to create diplomatic tension. &apos;There is a danger that too much foreign interest in American banks and Wall Street in general could generate negative sentiment in Washington,&apos; Braden said. Indeed, when Dubai Ports World - one of the world&apos;s largest ports operators, and controlled by the government of Dubai - attempted to acquire P&amp;O and a handful of strategic US ports, nationalistic feelings ran high in Washington.  Meanwhile, other US banks are also seeking help from outside investors. Washington Mutual, one of the biggest high street banking groups, is seeking a $2.5bn cash injection to stay afloat, and bond insurer MBIA had to go cap in hand to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $1bn to help it stay afloat."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/16/economics.economicscomment", "sentences": ["Ownership of the nerve centres of capitalism is changing as funds from Abu Dhabi and Singapore have bought into US and Swiss banks enfeebled by the credit crunch."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-16T23:38:36Z", "title": "A dark end  to a decade  of prosperity", "tags": ["Business", "Economics", "Gordon Brown", "Politics", "Economic policy"], "article": "Two stories have caught my eye in the past couple of days. The first was the riches-to-rags tale of Ed Mitchell, the former News at Ten presenter who now sleeps rough in Hove because he ran up \u00a3250,000 of debt on his credit cards. The second was a report from the London School of Economics that found that bright children from poor homes will be overtaken academically by the &apos;Tim Nice But Dim&apos; brigade by the age of seven. Both provide poignant windows into the darkness that has descended on Gordon Brown&apos;s decade of seeming prosperity.  Like poor old Ed Mitchell, Brown is a middle-class binge-borrower. The apparent economic wellbeing of the past decade has been built on a phalanx of debt on state, company and individual levels. Northern Rock - the corporate poster-child for reckless borrowing - will deal the weak public finances a nasty blow if, as is increasingly likely, it has to be nationalised; that would put the government at risk of breaking Brown&apos;s fiscal rule that public sector net debt should not be more than 40 per cent of national income. But for all the taxing and spending and complicated systems of credits, the government has not succeeded in its redistributive aims. In a study published earlier this year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that child poverty went up for the first time in six years, and, as the LSE has demonstrated, the chances of escaping a poor background through education are as bleak as they were 30 years ago. While the UK and the US have been running up mammoth deficits, emerging nations have been building their war chests. China has a glut of reserves and its population is saving at such a rate that one of its big problems is finding places to park all the cash. Ownership of the nerve centres of capitalism is changing as funds from Abu Dhabi and Singapore have bought into US and Swiss banks enfeebled by the credit crunch. Prudent emerging markets are gaining on the indebted West.  In the halcyon days of 1997, Brown won over many in the financial community with his reassurances that there would be no return to the economic mismanagement of earlier Labour administrations. But faith in the government&apos;s competence has been tested to the limit by the Inland Revenue&apos;s lost data fiasco and the botched changes to capital gains tax, as well as the farcical handling of Northern Rock, where Virgin, the leading bidder, lacks even the basic essentials of secure funding and authorisation to run a bank.  Brown has been true to his word and not attacked the City. Quite the reverse: he allowed it to run riot on the basis that its prosperity would trickle down to the rest of the country. But the financial successes, like Goldman Sachs, continue to pay out multi-million bonuses as if nothing has happened; the failures, like Northern Rock, end up being everybody&apos;s problem."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/16/subprimecrisis.creditcrunch1", "sentences": ["So, a couple of weeks ago, Citigroup, the biggest bank in the world&apos;s biggest economy, had to appeal outside the Western financial system to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for funds (at 11 per cent); and last week UBS, after declaring staggering losses in the US sub-prime market, had to shore itself up with funds from the Singapore Investment Corporation and an unnamed source in the Middle East."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-16T23:38:37Z", "title": "William Keegan: The terrible consequences of the financial world's diet of distrust", "tags": ["Business", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Credit crunch", "Economics", "US economy", "Banking", "Banks and building societies"], "article": "In JK Galbraith&apos;s magisterial work The Great Crash, 1929 there was (and is: it&apos;s never been out of print) a magnificently sardonic chapter entitled: &apos;In Goldman Sachs We Trust&apos;.  I have no doubt that the definitive work on the credit crunch will contain a chapter entitled, equally sardonically: &apos;In Central Banks We Trust&apos;.  I suspect that the understandable interest in this country in the problems of Northern Rock has diverted attention to some extent from the fact that that particular fiasco was symptomatic of a much wider problem: the loss of trust in the banking system - a loss of trust manifested, paradoxically, most vividly in the actions, or inactions, of bankers themselves. As one senior City figure put it to me last week: &apos;It is difficult to be sure whether banks are not lending to one another because they know that while they&apos;re all right the other fellow may not be, or because they suspect everybody else is in as dubious a position as they are.&apos; This lack of trust is blamed for the way individual commercial banks have been reluctant to be seen to borrow emergency funds from their central banks for fear of advertising that they were in trouble. That is why, in a quite sensational co-ordinated intervention, the leading central banks of the world took a major initiative last week, making emergency funds available to all and sundry in what they hope will be a discreet, non-penal and purposeful way.  Trust is an essential, but often underestimated aspect of business and banking. At a personal level, if our regular electrician, plumber or window-cleaner is out of action or unobtainable, most of us would much rather rely on a personal recommendation than risk hiring a cowboy out of the Yellow Pages. Businesses like reliable, regular sources of supply. Banks and building societies like to know with whom they are dealing. I say &apos;like&apos;, but of course should say &apos;liked&apos;. In the world of securitisation and the &apos;parcelling out&apos; of risk, trust and intimate knowledge of what things were worth and who was holding them became old hat. In the ultimate irony, while finance ministers and central bankers endlessly repeated the mantra of the wonders of &apos;transparency&apos;, banking operations, via such wonderfully opaque financial &apos;instruments&apos; as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) and structured investment vehicles (SIVs), became increasingly untransparent. I have been in the same room as former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan when he waxed lyrically, within the hallowed halls of the Bank of England, about the arcane wonders of the spreading and reduction of risk that such financial engineering putatively made possible.  SIVs sound like real vehicles. Unfortunately, they don&apos;t seem to work very well. We all know that it is not much good having a beautifully polished vehicle if there is no oil in the sump. Similarly, it is not much good if bank balance sheets look wonderful but there is insufficient liquidity in the system. What happened after the first signs of trouble appeared in the US sub-prime market and elsewhere in August was that the sump of the banking system ran dry, vast doubts were cast on the value of many of those financial engineering items in balance sheets, and trust collapsed. Things were not helped by what people saw when they were forced to put those &apos;off balance sheet&apos; items back on the balance sheet.  So, a couple of weeks ago, Citigroup, the biggest bank in the world&apos;s biggest economy, had to appeal outside the Western financial system to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for funds (at 11 per cent); and last week UBS, after declaring staggering losses in the US sub-prime market, had to shore itself up with funds from the Singapore Investment Corporation and an unnamed source in the Middle East. Nationalisation may be a dirty word in modern market economies, but Western capitalism is happy to bale itself out with help from nationalised concerns further afield.  And for those with a sepulchral sense of humour it was difficult not to laugh at the news that the shares of the Royal Bank of Scotland came under pressure last week after that very same Citigroup published what the Financial Times described as &apos;a negative note&apos; about RBS&apos;s financial position. Citigroup would no doubt be in a position to know. So Western financial capitalism can no longer convincingly preach the virtues of its &apos;securitisation&apos; model to the rest of the world, and increasingly needs to borrow from what it condescendingly calls &apos;emerging economies&apos; because that model has gone so hopelessly wrong.  So what about the impact of all this on the real economy? Nobody really knows. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development puts a brave face on the impact of the credit crunch in its December Economic Outlook. Given the importance of the US economy to the rest of the world, it is interesting that the OECD forecasts a slowdown there but no recession; but it is also interesting that it adds &apos;the trouble is that the probability distribution around this outcome has a fat tail on the downside&apos;. The US is being cushioned, as our own Professor Wynne Godley has pointed out, by the impact of the devaluation of the dollar on its exports, which the OECD estimates grew in volume by 10 per cent between the third quarters of 2006 and 2007, against a rise of only 1.5 per cent in imports. Nevertheless, so wide did the gap between exports and imports become during the period of irrational exuberance that the US is still expected by the OECD to run current account deficits of more than $2bn a day for years to come.

TVCatchup, which uses the strapline &quot;Never miss a show again&quot;, has been in test mode with 5,000 users and is launching a full advertising-funded service from January 1. However, the BBC, one of a number of broadcasters to pour tens of millions into launching media players and catch-up TV services, intends to investigate the legality of TVCatchup&apos;s business model. &quot;We are not aware of TVCatchup having approached us, nor have we given our permission for them to make BBC programmes available to the public on this basis,&quot; said a BBC spokesman.  &quot;We do not accept all of the assumptions and assertions that they have made in their terms of service, and will be looking into this further.&quot; TVCatchup, which has hired WPP-owned digital marketing company 24/7 Real Media to sell advertising - including banners and video ads around programming - has already run test ad campaigns with Renault and Hallmark. FX Channel has also run ads around The Simpsons on TVCatchup promoting its own show Family Guy. Adam Smith, co-founder of the company, admitted that TVCatchup is fully aware that its service was likely to be controversial, citing the case of a similar service in the US - RecordTV.com - which was forced to close in 2001.  &quot;I would think we will get a mixed reception from the broadcasters,&quot; said Smith.  He added that the company, through third parties, had &quot;approached&quot; broadcasters including ITV, Sky and Channel Five to offer them advertising slots around programming on the website. Smith said that there might be a &quot;possible problem&quot; with allowing viewers to record and watch shows from the US, but added that TVCatchup was operating within UK law. Digital rights deals with US producers and broadcasters usually entail the UK buyers having to charge consumers to view TV shows online. &quot;Legally they can do nothing about it,&quot; said Smith. &quot;We are not based over there ... we aren&apos;t recording, the users are, it is a personal service&quot;. TVCatchup said that in the UK the service is legal under the time-shifting exemption of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988. However, John Enser, media partner at legal firm Olswang, questioned whether the 1988 exemption covered TVCatchup&apos;s service. &quot;The time-shifting exception only applies to a recording made in domestic premises,&quot; he said. &quot;TVCatchup allows recordings to be made wherever their servers are, which is unlikely to be in a private house. It is difficult to see how they can claim the service is legal.&quot; TVCatchup currently offers 12 of the 19 free-to-air channels it says it can legally offer and has ambitious plans to offer full high-definition streaming of shows and to move into mobile TV next year. International expansion is also on the horizon with India, Canada, Australia and Singapore targeted as countries with similar relevant regulation to the UK. TVCatchup is burning through around \u00a330,000 in costs per month associated with storing and delivering TV shows to viewers. However, Smith said that if 24/7 Real Media can sell all the ad inventory on the website it can easily make &quot;triple that&quot; in revenue.

Three heavy storms and problems with the law put paid to that bid. A Guatemalan shark fisherman was killed and another injured when Earthrace hit their boat while sailing at night, which saw Bethune held briefly in prison. None of that was enough to put him off a second attempt and a trained crew will be complemented by paying members of the public in a mission that is equal parts record attempt and evangelical mission to trumpet the value of biofuels in the fight against global warming. Sitting in the cramped cockpit of his 78ft (24m) vessel, Bethune, a former oil industry worker, curses a &quot;dirty&quot; commuter boat which pumps out smoke and jokes he has &quot;swung over to the dark side&quot; by embracing plant power. &quot;The record is just a small part of the package,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to make people aware that biofuels need to be part of our transport energy mix and people should support them should they become available.&quot; The boat is nothing if not eye-catching; &quot;like something out of Dan Dare in the Eagle&quot; said David Noall, the master of the Queen Elizabeth Pier.

The designers told Bethune it would work &quot;like a hot knife through butter&quot;.  &quot;It&apos;s nothing like that,&quot; he said. &quot;In big seas it is brutal and violent. We had a big storm in New Zealand with 12 metre waves and we had five metres of water on top of the windscreen here. The surge of energy works its way through the boat as it goes through the wave.&quot;  The best respite is to strap into the racing car-style seats for the pilot and navigator or to lie on the ship&apos;s beanbag. Otherwise it can be agony, he said. The poundings left one crew member with kidneys so bruised that he urinated blood for 10 days, and another with a dislocated shoulder and cracked ribs. The \u00a33m boat is made from carbon fibre and is powered by two 540 horsepower engines which emit a deafening 85 decibels at cruising speed of 40 knots. The only way of escaping if the boat capsizes is by hacking a hole in the hull with an axe which hangs ominously on the cabin wall, which is otherwise decorated with good luck messages from some of the 100,000 members of the public in 60 cities around the world who have paid \u00a33 to tour the boat.

Adam Carlson, a 21-year-old sailor trained on combat boats in the Swedish navy, has been on board for the last four and a half months. He has tied up Earthrace in Hamburg, Amsterdam and Paris after they sailed up the Seine for two days and moored beside the Place de la Concorde. &quot;For sure we will break the record,&quot; he said over the noise of the engines. &quot;We have a really competent crew and we are having a refit in Valencia with experts from all across Europe coming to help us out.&quot; Bethune, who knows the dangers, is less sure and puts their chances at 50/50. &quot;The boat is fast enough to get the record, but you don&apos;t go round the world without having dramas on the way,&quot; he said. &quot;You pass through some of the most dangerous waterways in the world. We were east of Nicaragua earlier this year and a vessel approached us which looked just like pirates. There were five guys with M-16 assault rifles. We started to pull away and they caught us up and said they were navy but we weren&apos;t stopping so they opened fire. There are a couple of bullet holes in the boat from where they shot at us.

Intelligent citizens have begun to grasp that the 10-year-old programme to offer citizens joined-up electronic access to government (and government to citizens) is the biggest change to the government machine for 60 years, since the birth of the welfare state. The chattering is mainly hostile, of course, with a consensus that e-government will create a snooper&apos;s paradise or a permanent milch cow for IT consultancies. Or both. It&apos;s useless for those on the inside to roll their eyes and trot out case studies of successes in e-enabled government. (There are successes, though mainly they&apos;re the work of our despised and ridiculed local councils, rather than Whitehall.) The chattering classes&apos; verdict is a legitimate expression of outrage at a fundamental change in the government machine being foisted on citizens - and public servants - with almost no Parliamentary, let alone public, debate. But, ministers will say, we tried. And yes, they did - within the limits set by the technocratic imaginations of the mainly private-sector experts implementing the vision. Over nine years, a series of uninspiring papers have set out visions of &quot;modernised&quot;, &quot;e-enabled&quot;, or &quot;transformed&quot; government for anyone prepared to plough through their dismal consultancy-inspired language. What no one has done is set out the e-government programme in a political context. It&apos;s never featured prominently in election manifestos, or been debated in Parliament, let alone put to a referendum. Instead, it&apos;s presented almost as a force of nature, an inescapable tide of demography and technical innovation.  Yet there is nothing necessary or inevitable about joined-up e-government. The UK is not a unitary state like Singapore, and there seems to be a perfectly respectable argument for allowing taxpayer-funded organisations to operate as islands of information, held on paper, if people really want it that way. As it happens, I think that would be bonkers, but we need - as politicians always say - to have that debate. Thanks to an almost inconceivable blunder at the interface between HMRC and the National Audit Office, that debate is now getting under way. Its ebb and flow will mingle with, and be reinforced by, existing streams of concern about ID cards, the NHS electronic care records service and the ContactPoint children&apos;s index. This is healthy and necessary, because all these projects should be seen as part of a whole. From that debate, which will ideally involve a general election, some kind of political decision should emerge about the kind of machine we want government to be, and the information infrastructure supporting it. Once we&apos;ve made that decision, we can start building it. The process will take time, of course. To jolly things along, here&apos;s a modest suggestion. It involves an old IT management technique called the &quot;scream test&quot;: the way to find out what a rambling old IT system is really being used for is to turn it off and see who screams. To kick-start the e-government debate, we should do the same. That&apos;s right: turn it all off, from your council&apos;s webcam to NHS Healthspace to the DVLA&apos;s car tax online service. The whole shooting match, off. The screams, I suspect, will be louder than the chattering classes would have us believe."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/20/military.secondworldwar", "sentences": ["The Japanese vessel, en route from Batavia (now Jakarta) to Singapore, was carrying 1,600 troops and was the largest Japanese warship sunk by a Royal Navy vessel.", "Hezlet was then appointed director of the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich, followed by a posting to Singapore to command the cruiser HMS Newfoundland."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-20T23:56:56Z", "title": "Obituary: Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Hezlet", "tags": ["Military", "Second world war", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "On June 8 1945, the submarine HMS Trenchant slipped past a minefield into the confined waters of the Banka Strait, between Sumatra and Banka Island, in what was then the Dutch East Indies, and torpedoed the 13,300-ton heavy cruiser, the Ashigara. The Japanese vessel, en route from Batavia (now Jakarta) to Singapore, was carrying 1,600 troops and was the largest Japanese warship sunk by a Royal Navy vessel. The attack, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Arthur Hezlet, who has died aged 93, is still taught at naval colleges as one of the classic submarine actions of that war. During the course of the engagement, the submarine was twice attacked by a Japanese destroyer, the Kamikaze. Hezlet was born into a Northern Irish army family in Pretoria, South Africa, where his father was serving. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and then served on the battleships Royal Oak and Resolution and the cruiser Devonshire. During the Abyssinian crisis in 1935, he served on the minesweeper HMS Huntley in Malta before being compulsorily transferred to submarines. His first boat was HMS Regulus, engaged on anti-piracy patrols on the China station. He then served on HMS H43 before becoming first lieutenant of the new T-class boat, HMS Trident. He successfully completed his &quot;perishers&quot; course in 1940, designed to teach lieutenant commanders how to take sole command of a submarine, and took charge of HMS H44 before being posted to Malta in 1941 with the 10th Flotilla. Skippering HMS Unique, he sank the 11,400-ton Italian troop ship Esperia. After getting in among the escorts, he attacked from 600 yards and escaped by inadvertently entering an Italian minefield of which the escorts were aware and dared not follow. Later that day, Unique was attacked by a flying boat, causing an oil leak that necessitated an immediate return to Malta. He was greeted warmly on his arrival because the two other submarines sent out at the same time as Unique had both been sunk. He was awarded the DSC. Hezlet was then given command of HMS Ursula, in which he attacked an enemy convoy and damaged the 4,858-ton supply ship Beppe. Ursula even managed to get involved in a battle with an armoured car while the submarine&apos;s gun crew were engaged in shelling a coastal road bridge on the Italian mainland. Hezlet brought Ursula back to Britain and was given command of his old boat, Trident, engaged in operations around the convoys to northern Russia. He sank the 5,386-ton German ore carrier Hoedur. Trident then escorted Convoy PQ16 to Murmansk, a journey that saw almost constant action, and picked up survivors from sunken merchantmen. Hezlet then became a training officer for midget submarines in preparation for the attack on the German battleship Tirpitz in the Altenfjord, Norway, in 1943. He wrote the training programme and had a major say in who was chosen for the eventual attack, which put the battleship out of action for months. Then, after taking command of HMS Thrasher, he towed the midget submarine X-5 across the North Sea for the attack itself. Hezlet and his crew then transferred to Trenchant and took the vessel to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) for a series of long patrols, during which they sank numerous small craft. He was ordered to patrol off Penang on the morning of September 23 1944. He then sighted the German U-boat 859 on the surface as she prepared to rendezvous with a Japanese escort to take her into harbour. U-859 had sailed from Germany with ballast consisting of mercury, which the Japanese needed urgently for their war industries. Hezlet sank her with a single torpedo amidships. Minutes later, he noticed yellow lifejackets bobbing to the surface as survivors escaped from the wreck some 50 metres below. He surfaced and rescued 11 before the appearance of the Japanese escort necessitated a hasty withdrawal. He was awarded the DSO. After sinking the Ashigara he was awarded the American Legion of Merit and a bar to his DSO. He returned to Britain days before the Japanese surrender as one of only a score of men who had served throughout the war on submarines. At the end of 1946 he was selected to be the second in command of the British observers to the US atom bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. In 1949 he was given command of the destroyer HMS Scorpion before promotion and a return to the admiralty. After staff college in 1955, he became Captain &quot;D&quot; of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, serving on HMS Battleaxe. Hezlet was then appointed director of the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich, followed by a posting to Singapore to command the cruiser HMS Newfoundland. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1959 as flag officer submarines at a time when the Royal Navy still had some 40 submarines and its first nuclear-powered boat, HMS Dreadnought was being built. Knighted in 1964, his final posting was as flag officer Scotland and Northern Ireland as vice admiral. Hezlet then returned to Northern Ireland, where he had inherited the family seat, Boveagh House, Aghadowey, County Londonderry. In retirement he led a busy life, serving for 25 years with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the Royal British Legion. He served on the general synod of the Church of Ireland and was an original council member of the University of Ulster. His publications included The Submarine and Sea Power (1967), Aircraft and Sea Power (1970), The &quot;B&quot; Specials: a history of the Ulster Special Constabulary (1972), Electron and Seapower (1975), The Trenchant at War (2001) and British and Allied Submarine Operations in World War II, completed in 2002 shortly before strokes prevented further work. He is survived by his wife Patricia and two adopted daughters. \u00b7 Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Richard Hezlet, submariner, born April 7 1914; died November 7 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/21/5", "sentences": [" The Financial Times today reported that UBS, one of the biggest casualties of the sub-prime turmoil, is facing shareholder revolt over plans for a substantial injection of funds from Singapore and the Middle East."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T09:33:59Z", "title": "UBS faces investor revolt over Middle East funding", "tags": ["UBS", "Business", "European banks"], "article": " The Financial Times today reported that UBS, one of the biggest casualties of the sub-prime turmoil, is facing shareholder revolt over plans for a substantial injection of funds from Singapore and the Middle East.

Yildiz, the owner of \u00dclker Group, the largest consumer goods company in the Turkish food industry, agreed to acquire the brand from Campbell Soup. Campbell put Godiva up for sale in August, saying it did not fit with its strategy of focusing on simple meals like soup. Douglas R. Conant, Campbell&apos;s chief executive, said he was pleased with the price obtained for the chocolatier. He added: &quot;The agreement allows \u00dclker to expand and diversify its portfolio with an elite, global luxury brand and enables Campbell to sharpen our strategic focus on simple meals, anchored by soup, baked snacks, and vegetable-based beverages.&quot; Godiva has annual sales of around $500m. It has more than 270 retail shops in the US, Europe, and Asia and over 2,000 wholesale customers. It also has a direct-sales business through its website. The sale is expected to be completed in the next few months, ending more than 40 years of Campbell ownership of the chocolate brand. Godiva was founded in 1926 in Brussels by Joseph Draps. He named his chocolate company after Lady Godiva, a beautiful noblewoman married to the Earl of Mercia 10 centuries ago.  According to legend, she took pity on the people of Coventry, who were suffering under her husband&apos;s oppressive taxation. He said he would remit the tolls if she rode naked through the town which, according to legend, she did. The first Godiva shop outside Belgium was opened in Paris in 1958 on the upmarket street Rue du Faubourg St-Honor\u00e9. In 1966, Godiva made its North American debut at Wanamaker&apos;s in Philadelphia. In the same year, a controlling interest in the company was sold to Campbell, which later acquired the rest of the company. Godiva then expanded to Asia, with the first chocolates becoming available in Japan in central Tokyo in 1972.

State bailouts of banks are all the rage too. There is just one snag: western institutions are not getting their cash from ministers in London or Washington, but from functionaries in Beijing. While Britain&apos;s chancellor still balks at taking Northern Rock into public ownership, his counterparts in China have no qualms about investing state money in the private sector. This week Beijing bought a 10% stake in the Wall Street blue chip Morgan Stanley; in May it took a slab of the private-equity giant Blackstone. Those two deals, worth just over \u00a34bn, were made by the China Investment Corporation (CIC), a fund set up and run by the government. With over \u00a3100bn to burn, it is bound to make more big deals - and big headlines - over the coming year. CIC is one of a new breed of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) created by nations awash with excess cash from exporting goods or oil. Most oil-producing Arab countries have one, as do Russia, Korea and Singapore, and the funds are estimated to be worth a total of a trillion pounds. The logic behind them is simple: if energy-rich Russia is earning around \u00a3425m from exports every day, it naturally wants to invest those dollars for a higher return. But the impact of these new vehicles is far less straightforward, and it has largely been left to economics wonks to worry about them (even now, a Google search for &quot;SWFs&quot; brings up page after page about some graphic-design software). At last, however, they are entering political debate. The IMF is working on a code of conduct for the funds, while the rich nations&apos; club, the OECD, is coming up with guidelines for recipients. Such users&apos; manuals have their place, but on their own they are not an adequate answer to the issues raised by SWFs. At their most basic level, these funds (which are projected to be worth \u00a37.5 trillion within a decade) embody a shift of economic power from Europe and America to China, Russia and elsewhere. They sum up one of the global economy&apos;s problems too: the west is consuming far more than it is producing. SWFs are also a new and very different kind of investor. &quot;Cross-border nationalisations&quot; is how Larry Summers refers to them; a strong phrase from someone who, when Democrat treasury secretary, was full of the joys of globalisation. What worries him and many others is that these investments may not be made for financial returns, but for political ends. After all, commercial considerations are unlikely to be paramount for totalitarian regimes. If Moscow is willing to play politics with an art exhibition supposedly heading to the Royal Academy, what could it do with a chunk of a British energy company? Free marketeers argue that this is all hypothetical and that sovereign funds have been around for a few decades without causing a fuss. Right on both counts, but Norway and others have typically squirrelled them away in a variety of investments - a few shares here, a bunch of bonds there. China, Abu Dhabi and these new SWFs are taking large, powerful positions in a few companies. This is a new kind of capitalism, and the difficulty for the west in responding to it is avoiding kneejerk jingoism. American politicians have already fallen into that trap, by kicking up such a fuss over a Chinese computer firm buying parts of IBM or Dubai taking over US ports. But governments should not be shy about marking certain industries (such as energy) as being of national importance, and off limits to other states. What about the investor countries? Beijing&apos;s surplus cash would be better employed within China. Sorting out basic national problems such as pollution and sanitation would surely be a far better use of state funds than buying stakes in private-equity firms. A sovereign wealth fund may be further demonstration that Beijing has arrived as a major world power, but it does very little for the rank-and-file Chinese."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/21/merrilllynch.creditcrunch", "sentences": ["Investment bank Merrill Lynch is joining a scramble for foreign capital among Wall Street firms by seeking to repair its battered balance sheet with $5bn (\u00a32.5bn) from Singapore&apos;s cash-rich government fund, Temasek Holdings.", "It controls Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecoms, owns a 13% stake in Standard Chartered Bank and bought 2% of Barclays earlier this year.", "Morgan Stanley secured $5bn from the China Investment Corporation, while Bear Stearns struck a $2bn alliance with China&apos;s Citic Securities and Zurich-based UBS raised $9.5bn from funds in Singapore and the Middle East."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T18:03:19Z", "title": "Merrill 'to take $5bn from Singapore fund'", "tags": ["Merrill Lynch", "Credit crunch", "Banking", "US economy", "Business"], "article": "Investment bank Merrill Lynch is joining a scramble for foreign capital among Wall Street firms by seeking to repair its battered balance sheet with $5bn (\u00a32.5bn) from Singapore&apos;s cash-rich government fund, Temasek Holdings.

The seven UK airports operated by BAA are Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Southampton and Aberdeen. This has been corrected.   More than 1 million air passengers face a miserable start to the new year after staff at Britain&apos;s largest airport owner voted for a wave of strikes next month. BAA runs Heathrow and Gatwick plus five other UK airports, which it will shut if unions go ahead with planned 24-hour walkouts from 6am on January 7 and 14, followed by a 48-hour strike on January 17. The industrial action will affect at least 1.3 million passengers, who will either have to book flights from alternative airports or journey by other means, while travel from BAA airports will also be disrupted on the days immediately after the strikes. Unite represents 5,800 BAA staff, and the union called the strikes because the airport group closed its final salary pension scheme to new entrants. Brendan Gold, Unite&apos;s national aviation secretary, said: &quot;Without doubt, in my view, it will result in the closure of those seven airports during that timeframe [and cause] a huge amount of disruption.&quot; BAA was holding out for an amicable solution to the dispute yesterday and asked for the &quot;understanding of passengers&quot; as it continued talks with union representatives. British Airways, BAA&apos;s largest airline, told travellers not to cancel bookings: &quot;We are speaking to BAA to understand its operational contingency plans if industrial action goes ahead. We have not cancelled any flights at this stage, and therefore we aim to operate as normal.&quot; However, the world&apos;s busiest international airport, Heathrow, will close if the strikes take place. The majority of staff who voted to strike are deployed on security checkpoints, plus firefighters whose presence is mandatory in an airport. It is expected BAA will be unable to recruit auxiliary guards or firefighters from the army - an idea mooted during the airport security crackdown in 2006 - because they are not trained to use x-ray machines or to handle civilian aircraft. BAA&apos;s other UK airports are: Stansted, Southampton, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Its terminals account for nearly two-thirds of all airport arrivals and departures in the UK. The Association of British Travel Agents said that it would work with airlines to ensure that holidaymakers got to their destinations. An ABTA spokeswoman said: &quot;Other non-BAA airports such as Luton, Birmingham and Manchester may be able to help out.&quot; A January walkout will be the latest in a list of setbacks for BAA. It has struggled to recover from the disruption of the alleged liquid bomb plot in August last year, which cause a security clampdown which brought its biggest airports, including Heathrow, to a standstill. Unite blamed BAA&apos;s Spanish owner, Ferrovial, for the dispute yesterday. Gold said BAA executives wanted to avoid strikes but were &quot;dictated to&quot; by Ferrovial chairman Rafael del Pino, who oversaw the \u00a310.3bn takeover of BAA last year and is attempting to refinance the company&apos;s \u00a39bn debts. &quot;They have bought the business and they are trying to screw the money out of it,&quot; said Gold. BAA has assured government ministers that the decision to close the final salary pension scheme to newcomers was arrived at independently by its board, which includes three Ferrovial representatives. A Ferrovial spokesman said that the pension move was a &quot;BAA decision&quot;. Gold said BAA could easily afford to finance its pension scheme and defended the size of its strike mandate, which saw a third of BAA&apos;s Unite staff backing a strike on a 53% turnout. The British Chamber of Commerce said the strikes would be a dreadful start for the economy in 2008, and cost millions of pounds at a time when the UK needed to &quot;pull together&quot; to avert an economic downturn. &quot;The reputation of our airports in the eyes of international travellers will be further diminished when travellers get to the UK and are met by chaos,&quot; said David Frost, BCC director general. Staff will be joined on strike by members of the PCS union, which represents managerial staff at BAA. Cabin crew at Virgin Atlantic are staging separate 48-hour walkouts on January 9 and January 16, which will ground 10% of the airline&apos;s flights. Other options Airports not affected by the strike include: East Midlands Flights to Acapulco, Gambia, Bratislava, Jersey, Norway, Tunisia as well as many European cities. Manchester A wide range of destinations on all continents, eg Munich, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Atlanta, Brazil. Prestwick Many European business cities including Frankfurt, Paris and Oslo. Liverpool European destinations including Cologne, Madrid, Geneva. London City Direct to a large range of business destinations in Europe and Scandinavia.

In spite of Boston&apos;s relentlessly bad press, it is more mixed than the statistics suggest. The parish reflects this, with three churches serving three different communities. At its heart stands Boston Stump, one of the biggest parish churches in England, a five-star medieval building with a fine choral tradition, a lecturer, a ghost and the kind of ornamental ministry ancient civic churches retain. As lecturer, deputising for the vicar, I had a wonderful time: I chugged out to sea as chaplain to the mayor of Boston on his annual inspection of the beacons and buoys on behalf of the hereditary Lord High Admiral of the Wash; I blessed the May fair, begun in the 12th century; I led the mayors and lady mayoresses on eastern England in the singing of &apos;God Be With You Till We Meet Again&apos;, to the accompaniment of a fairground organ; I gave three cheers when the town clerk declared the Beast Mart open and the grammar school closed and undertook not to walk abroad in the night during the time of the said mart without lawful cause upon pain of imprisonment. We had two other churches, one on the respectable edge of town with an excellent Church of England primary school, and another in the roughest part of town, the council estate which generated most of those sorry statistics. It was diverse, sometimes difficult, always rewarding, a good place to learn the elements of parish ministry. In Knightsbridge, the parish is geographically tiny, as London parishes tend to be, taking in the chunk of Belgravia between the high commissions of Singapore and Lesotho. Like Boston, it is full of migrant workers, but they work in banks, not fields, for shareholders, not gang masters. Here, too, I look after a school, an excellent independent prep and pre-prep, which was having its carol service last week. I asked the children what they were doing for the Christmas holidays. They were all going away, to the Maldives, to New York, to Australia. One little boy was spending the first week in Switzerland, the second in America, the third in Brazil. In my former parish, quite a number of the children would be lucky to get past the security guard at Asda and &apos;going away&apos; was an enterprise more likely to be organised by Group 4. I have yet to see homemade tattoos across a Knightsbridge bride&apos;s shoulders, or have a funeral service interrupted by the arrival of a mourner in shackles or have a candidate for baptism mark the solemnity of the occasion by sticking her chewing gum to the edge of the font. The differences are obvious; what are more interesting and surprising are the similarities. The incomes may be higher here, but the personalities are the same, particularly among our regulars who try to be faithful to the gospel, to live alongside one another, to contribute to our common life, to make sense of things. These similarities may also be seen in those two enduring preoccupations: death and Christmas. An incongruous pairing, you may think, but funerals and carol services still bring people through our doors, people who would ordinarily never come in. They may find our language and our liturgy incomprehensible, they may find our clergy embarrassing or annoying, but still they come when someone dies to sing &apos;The Lord&apos;s My Shepherd&apos;, and at Christmas to sing &apos;Hark the Herald&apos;. I don&apos;t suppose too many connect with the theology, even though, as Katie Melua, discussing carol services on the Today programme rightly observed: &apos;Some of the lyrics are quite Christian.&apos; If not to correct defective theologies of the incarnation and resurrection, why do people come? In Knightsbridge, we host each year a carol service for Sands, a charity that takes care of families who have lost a son or daughter in childbirth or to sudden infant death syndrome. As this most random assortment of people passed by, queuing to light a candle in memory of their children, I was so moved, so awkward, that I had to look at my feet rather than at them. The chancel filled with hundreds of tiny, flickering lights and we sang of a birth 2,000 years ago on a dark night, in a bleak midwinter, of a child who will die and with his death open up unimaginable possibilities of new life. I stood after the service at the doors of the church, where the vicar and I have stood every night for the past fortnight shaking hands with thousands of strangers, only on this occasion I hesitated to wish them a happy Christmas. They all wished me one, even through tears, as they departed into Knightsbridge, the hotels and shops festooned with tasteful, unblinking white lights. Christmas in Boston can be dark, too, but the meanest streets of its meanest quarter blaze and flash with unrestrained brilliance. People used to visit from the posh end, nervous tourists in its winter wonderland, counting the Santas and the snowmen on the houses and wondering how they&apos;d fiddled the leccy. The most memorable display, however, was in another part of town. I was on my way one dark afternoon to the crematorium and as I approached the cemetery gates, I saw that someone had installed over them a glow-in-the-dark Santa in his sleigh. Quite what effect this jolly ensemble had on a passing cortege I can only imagine. However, it has stayed with me, not for its incongruity, but for presenting so clearly the incomparable pair of death and Christmas. On Christmas Day, we will hear again words from the great prologue to the Gospel of John: &apos;The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.&apos;In Boston and Knightsbridge, I think they still come because at that most significant level, which passeth understanding, we know about the darkness and the light. \u00b7 The Rev Richard Coles is curate of St Paul&apos;s, Knightsbridge, chaplain to the Royal Academy of Music and a former member of the Communards"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/dec/23/googlesgrowthbycomscorenum", "sentences": ["With AOL UK&apos;s video search, two of my top three Zune hits are for iTunes, and the first page of results includes CNet, iFilm, Crackle and MSN Singapore, as well as YouTube."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T18:05:00Z", "title": "Google's growth, by ComScore numbers", "tags": ["Internet", "Google", "Technology"], "article": "TechCrunch has an interesting post about Google&apos;s growth over the past year, based on ComScore numbers. It says:  According to figures from comScore Google traffic increased 22.42% this year across its main web properties (excluding non-US sites and acquired sites such as YouTube). The star performer for the year was Google&apos;s personalized start page service iGoogle which increased traffic in the 12 months to November by 267.64%. Other strong performers included Google Book Search up 54.66%, Gmail up 53.6% and Google Maps up 51.57%.    iGoogle started from a low base, but back in July, I noted that &quot;a growing number of people are starting to use iGoogle, the company&apos;s personalised home page offering&quot;. It&apos;s a service I show people as usually they haven&apos;t heard of it, and I think it&apos;s useful, though not everyone wants to adopt it. On the downside, traffic to Google Product Search -- formerly Froogle -- fell by 73.26%. This isn&apos;t too surprising, because it&apos;s not very good. What may be surprising is that Shopping still gets a spot on Google&apos;s hugely valuable home page, whereas Video -- down 12% -- is hidden under More. Google Video is another poor service, but perhaps Google is still struggling to stop being evil. Google Video (Beta) lets you select to search &quot;all videos&quot; or &quot;videos hosted by Google&quot; but it packs its home page with plugs for YouTube. Google owns YouTube, and YouTube dominates the market, so rival sites don&apos;t get much exposure. Search for Zune, for example, and 95% of the first 10 pages of results are YouTube videos. Search for U2 and 99% are for YouTube or Google Video.

We sang it in Singapore when I played a shepherd in the nativity play aged six. At the end, we all stood round and sang it and I&apos;ve loved it ever since. I love the atmosphere that it conjures up of the Holy Lamb all those years ago because I think most carols concentrate on the stable. But if you think of the Holy Lamb itself, if you think of olive trees and winter and wind and snow and all the rest of it, well, it&apos;s just rather different. Carols still have an importance. We all think of the carol singers gathered round lanterns, all wrapped up in coats and scarves. It&apos;s just a thing that goes quite inevitably with Christmas. Antony Worrall Thompson, chef While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night Traditional While shepherds watched their flocks by night All seated on the ground The angel of the Lord came down And glory shone around. When we were kids, we used to sing: &apos;While shepherds washed their socks by night&apos;. We did Songs of Praise once at our school and we were spotted on camera singing the wrong words and about three of us got beaten for that. I was in the choir, so to do that was a bit naughty. I still say to my son: &apos;Go on, see if you can get away with it.&apos; I like all the classic carols - &apos;O Come All Ye Faithful&apos;, &apos;Once in Royal David&apos;s City&apos;, &apos;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&apos; - all those are good tunes. I&apos;m not religious, you see, so I don&apos;t go to church very often, but I like getting back into them. Carol Ann Duffy, poet In The Bleak Midwinter Music by Gustav Holst, 1906, words by Christina Rosetti, 1872 In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan Earth stood hard as iron Water like a stone Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow In the bleak midwinter Long ago. It&apos;s just a beautiful poem, beautiful words. I&apos;m moved when I hear it even now. All carols for me just mean childhood. My mother was a hugely Christmassy mum. I was her first child and I was born at Christmas, on the 23rd - hence the name. So she always associated Christmas with having her first baby. She said that when the new mothers were first given their babies on Christmas Eve, the nurses in this hospital - who wore red cloaks - came round with lanterns singing carols, so I think this sentiment is wired into me. Dom Joly, comedian Once In Royal David&apos;s City Traditional When I was a kid, they&apos;d get the biggest eunuch in the King&apos;s College choir in Cambridge to sing it. I think they still do. Because we grew up in the Middle East, it symbolised Christmas for me. So wherever we were, we&apos;d drive up a sand dune or get in the bomb shelter and try to listen to the BBC World Service and hear it. Wherever I was, it&apos;s just one of those things that grounds you every year. So that&apos;s kind of amazing to me, but on the other hand, it&apos;s a nightmare because it&apos;s obviously a carol that I&apos;m never going to be able to sing unless I have my testicles removed. Hattie Morahan, actress Deck The Halls Traditional Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la, la la la la &apos;Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la, la la la la. It makes me laugh. It&apos;s got really silly lyrics, it sort of feels like you&apos;re singing like a theme-park version of the carol, it&apos;s kitsch, almost. I think there&apos;s a bit that goes, &apos;Don we now our gay apparel/ Troll the ancient Yuletide carol&apos;. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever &apos;trolled&apos; a song in my life! We&apos;ve got a family tradition of going to midnight Mass, so we troop out in the dead of night and it gets quite giggly. It just feels really fun, very strange and like a secret cult or something. It&apos;s always a funny occasion, hearing your dad sing - I don&apos;t think he&apos;s the world&apos;s best. You&apos;re always sort of listening out for your family having a go at it. Josie Long, comedian Ding Dong Merrily on High French, 16th century Ding dong merrily on high In heav&apos;n the bells are ringing Ding dong! verily the sky Is riv&apos;n with angel singing Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis. I used to sing in the church choir as a kid and there&apos;s a special low descant version of the chorus that you can sing. When you were a little kid, getting through that chorus was a big deal. I can remember deliberately taking a big breath and - &apos;Uh, I did it!&apos; I still sing the descant now, but I sing it on my own like a loser. I think with carols, if you know the descant, it feels like you&apos;re absolutely obliged to sing it. It&apos;s also the lyrics that appeal: because it&apos;s quite old the lyrics are silly. The bit about &apos;and &quot;I-o I-o I-o&quot;&apos;, that&apos;s ridiculous! And you get to sing that in church and nobody minds. But you&apos;re not taking the mick, it&apos;s sweet as well. KT Tunstall, singer Little Donkey By Eric Boswell, 1959 Little donkey, little donkey on the dusty road Got to keep on plodding onwards with your precious load Been a long time, little donkey, through the winter&apos;s night Don&apos;t give up now, little donkey Bethlehem&apos;s in sight. I&apos;m not religious, so a lot of carols don&apos;t really have the resonance for me that they may for a Christian. But if you just hear a little kid, who can&apos;t pronounce the words properly, going &apos;wittle donkey&apos;, it&apos;s the most gorgeous sound in the world. It&apos;s all about the donkey for me. Poor little donkey carrying a big pregnant woman! Whenever I&apos;m doing soundchecks, I always play &apos;Walking in the Air&apos;. It&apos;s brilliant, it has a really clever chord progression and it&apos;s really easy to pick on the guitar. Whenever I start playing it, someone starts singing it because everybody knows it. It was lovely when that came out because it wasn&apos;t steeped in religious connotations, it was just a nice story. Kate Mosse, novelist Once In Royal David&apos;s City Traditional I&apos;ve always loved the carol but when my daughter was 11, she was the girl who sang the first verse. I heard her draw breath before she started and I burst into tears before she&apos;d sung a single note. She was a very small 11-year-old, so watching her walking up the aisle between these silent and dark seats with just this one candle was amazing. &apos;Once in Royal David&apos;s City&apos; is also a narrative carol; it tells the story of what happened and I like that. It also seems to be one that connects my childhood with my parenthood. You just can&apos;t conceive of a carol concert without &apos;Once in Royal David&apos;s City&apos; at the beginning. Leanne Jones, actress and singer, star of Hairspray In The Bleak Midwinter Traditional It has got beautiful lyrics, a beautiful simple melody and it makes me think of Christmas. I can imagine it all - a snowy scene in the dead of night and because it&apos;s slow and simple, it&apos;s quite atmospheric. It&apos;s always one of the quieter ones that people hush and listen to, especially to the words. It reminds me of singing in assembly with my headmaster, Mr Burgess, when I was maybe eight or nine. He used to scour the room to find someone to sing and I was always sitting there with my back straight and my fingers on my lips going: &apos;Please! Please pick me!&apos; It&apos;s not at every single carol service, though, so when people do sing it, it&apos;s like: &apos;Oh I love this one.&apos; Shazia Mirza, comedian Away In A Manger Traditional Away in a manger No crib for His bed The little Lord Jesus Laid down His sweet head The stars in the bright sky Looked down where He lay The little Lord Jesus Asleep on the hay. It is the first carol that I learnt when I was at primary school: we did a mini-play to go with the carol and I was Mary Magdalene. It reminds me of standing in assembly, with the headmaster telling us about the seriousness of Christmas and that this is a time for caring and giving and snow. But Christmas just isn&apos;t like that any more; now we have global warming, there&apos;s no snow. Every time I go into a shop, they&apos;re playing Mariah Carey&apos;s &apos;All I Want for Christmas Is You&apos;. &apos;Away in a Manger&apos; just reminds me of being Mary Magdalene and I&apos;ve come such a long way from Mary Magdalene. I see myself more as Mariah Carey now. Simon Armitage, poet Away In A Manger Traditional What makes me choose it is complete sentimentality. After we&apos;d had our daughter, we went to church on Christmas Eve and they do this service here called a Christingle. Everyone carries a candle that&apos;s stuck in an orange - it looks like you&apos;ve got a little Sputnik in your hand - and they set fire to it. The highlight is when they turn all the lights off in the church so there&apos;s just candlelight and then you sing &apos;Away in a Manger&apos; and, I suppose on some weird level, it felt as if we were there with our own Baby Jesus. There&apos;s also something about the words as well - the first verse is a description of a nativity scene, but later on that &apos;Be near me, Lord Jesus&apos; moves it from the descriptive into something very personal. Our daughter knows the words - she&apos;ll sing it for herself now, rather than us holding her in our arms as the infant Christ. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty Little Donkey Traditional The carol I like the best is &apos;Little Donkey&apos; because of course that&apos;s the children&apos;s one. I&apos;ve got a five-year-old myself so I&apos;ve now heard it a couple of times at school nativity plays. &apos;Little donkey, little donkey, on the dusty road/ Got to keep on plodding onwards with your precious load.&apos; It&apos;s a bit like Liberty, isn&apos;t it? Ploughing on in the face of adversity but with such precious values to defend. It&apos;s very sweet, particularly when sung by small children when they don&apos;t quite hit the tops notes on the &apos;safely on her way&apos;. Simon Russell Beale, actor A Spotless Rose By Herbert Howells, 1919 A spotless Rose is blowing Sprung from a tender root Of ancient seers&apos; foreshowing Of Jesse promised fruit Its fairest bud unfolds to light Amid the cold, cold winter, And in the dark midnight. It is absolutely ravishing. It&apos;s very rich and has the most luscious harmonies at the end, like a close harmony group.It always reminds me of when my parents settled in north Wiltshire and of coming back from the pub, late at night, on a cold winter&apos;s night. It&apos;s quite a mystical area - it has the Avebury stones - and that carol always reminds me of something ancient and mysterious. I sang it virtually every year of my life for 20 years. I used to be a tenor, pathetically, so I was never given the solo. When the baritone solo comes in, you want it to be a perfectly lovely voice. My favourite carol service is the Advent service, which is at the beginning of December. I love the ones on Christmas Eve, but the Advent one is, I think, terribly moving. It&apos;s about expectation and waiting and I love that. Tamsin Greig, actress O Come, O Come Emmanuel  Traditional O come, O come, Emmanuel And ransom captive Israel That mourns in lonely exile here Until the Son of God appear Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel. I think it was originally a 12th-century chant and then was redone in the 19th century and the words translated from the Latin. It&apos;s so beautiful, it sounds like a windpipe, there&apos;s that sort of sense that we are instruments as we sing it. Parts of it are in a minor key; there&apos;s a sense of melancholy about our need for Christ to come. It talks about Satan, and the depths of hell, and the gloomy clouds of night, death&apos;s dark shadow, the path to misery: there&apos;s something quite honest about the carol. It feels like someone knows what&apos;s going on in the world. But also, at the end of every verse it says &apos;Rejoice&apos;. It&apos;s just this fantastic amalgam of what the reality is: to struggle in life but also to have hope. I&apos;ve just done a carol concert in aid of a charity called Adfam that supports families of addicts. There were these beautiful readings - prose pieces by people who are affected by the addictive ways of people they&apos;re related to. So you got these incredible carols and beautiful music but then also these readings from people who were struggling with lonely exile, which is exactly what I think &apos;O Come O Come Emmanuel&apos; talks about.

In the past week alone, the Chinese have bought a 10 per cent stake in Morgan Stanley for $5bn, and Temasek of Singapore is ready to pump the same amount into Merrill Lynch. British banks, including Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered, have also been selling stakes to sovereign funds (see table). Sovereign wealth funds have been born out of excess central bank reserves which have been built up by oil-producing nations, and by the Asian countries which have bankrolled the current account deficit in the US. Their rise has been one of the big stories of 2007. They will become an even more formidable force in the next few years, with their assets forecast to increase more than fourfold to $7.9trn by 2011, according to a recent report by Merrill Lynch. The positive case for sovereign investment in banks is that it can open up opportunities in developing countries. Some, such as Temasek, are by all accounts stable and intelligent investors.  But should we view the incongruous spectacle of arch-capitalists getting into bed with Red China with equanimity? The key issue for Western governments is whether the sovereign funds are driven by commercial motives, or whether they are acting as levers for undemocratic regimes with a covert political agenda. There seems no obvious way of finding out the answer.  For the developing nations themselves, the issue is whether buying into foreign banks is the best thing for the sovereign funds to do with the money. Some would argue they would do better to deploy their cash at home.  One of the ironies of the current situation is that in the past, it has been emerging markets that have worried about selling their prime assets too cheaply to first-world predators. Now, there are fears among bank shareholders that the sovereign funds may be getting their stakes at a knock-down price. Institutional shareholders in Swiss bank UBS are complaining about the terms of its share sale to Singapore and Saudi Arabia, and as one banker told me last week: &apos;If someone had told you that you could buy around 10 per cent of Morgan Stanley a year ago, you would have laughed your head off.&apos;  There is no doubt the sovereign funds are driving a hard bargain, and it is one that could well pay off. The banks are struggling, but their long-term growth prospects are sound, thanks to the demand for financial products from ageing populations in the West, and from businesses and the emergent middle classes in the developing world. The International Monetary Fund is working on a code that should encourage sovereign funds to operate more transparently and professionally and, in the UK, Sir David Walker is hoping they will sign up to his code of practice for private equity investors. At the moment, the funds vary in their practices, but measures such as appointing boards to oversee investments, independent audits and issuing annual reports would help ease legitimate concerns and head off the protectionist backlash. Voluntary codes, though, are just that, and it is hard to see how the IMF or anyone else could enforce compliance. For all the thorny issues around sovereign funds, protectionism is not the solution. Some strategic industries, such as defence, need to be ring-fenced, but bona fide investors should be welcome here. So if the Chinese - who rescued MG Rover - are looking for another investment in the UK, why not Northern Rock? Beijing could hardly be worse than Whitehall."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/23/creditcrunch1", "sentences": ["Abu Dhabi&apos;s sovereign wealth fund invested $7.5bn in Citigroup last month, and the Singapore government and an unnamed Middle Eastern investor has ploughed SFr13bn (\u00a35.7bn) into Swiss bank UBS."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T23:54:08Z", "title": "Which way now when the world has shifted?", "tags": ["Business", "Credit crunch"], "article": "If you landed in London from another planet this month and picked up the Financial Times&apos;s glossy How to Spend It magazine, you would not suspect for a nanosecond that there was a crisis on the world money markets. In 120 pages of unabashed haute consumerism, ads for Tiffany ran alongside features on record couture sales at Christian Dior, with scarcely a hint at harsh realities such as multibillion-pound bank write-offs, smaller bonuses and lost City jobs.  The truth, however, is that in 2007 the financial world was turned upside down: the credit crunch has toppled a golden decade of extraordinary prosperity in the UK and accelerated a shift in the global balance of economic power. One consequence is that banks in the City and Wall Street, the engine rooms of capitalism, have been so desperate for cash that they have sold large chunks of their equity to China or Middle Eastern states. The credit crunch has spawned plenty of soul searching about financial regulation, debt risks and the like. But more thoughtful financiers acknowledge it has also prompted broader reflection on the City&apos;s role in modern Britain. David Buik of spread betting firm Cantor Index says: &apos;The day the queues formed outside Northern Rock branches marked a sea change. It was the end of the illusion that we - individuals, companies and governments - could go on running up debt with impunity. It was a wake-up call, particularly for a younger generation which has never known financial hardship, negative equity, high unemployment, never known the economy to be less than benign. It also revealed the truth about our system of financial regulation, that was supposed to be so brilliant, but did not work when put to the test.&apos;  With hindsight, the first signs of a gathering financial storm came early in the year, when HSBC, which owns the former Midland Bank in the UK, admitted that it had written off $10.5bn of bad debts, a large chunk of it on home loans to poor borrowers in America. The bank came in for a huge lashing from its shareholders, but few, at that stage, made the leap to realising it was a much wider problem. Loans made to cash-strapped American homebuyers had been packaged up into fancy investment vehicles and sold to investors around the world; banks are unsure of the extent of their rivals&apos; - even possibly their own - exposure, and therefore are unwilling to lend to each other.  That matters because it has hit our high-street banks: Northern Rock is being supported by the taxpayer to the tune of \u00a355bn and looks to be heading for nationalisation. It could also hit the wider economy. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who prides himself on being calm and understated, warned last week of a &apos;palpable sense of fear&apos; that could send the economy into free fall.  The City has in the past decade turned itself from a comparative backwater into a genuine rival to Wall Street. But the credit crunch means jobs will be lost and bonuses smaller. In Covent Garden, Portland Place and Berkeley Square, the private equity barons, who menaced FTSE 100 companies with audacious takeover bids in the first part of the year, have watched their flood of deals dry to a trickle. On the high street, tills will not be ringing so loudly and, on Acacia Avenue, homeowners are worrying about their mortgages. Some will see the crisis as an overdue humbling of City arrogance. The past 10 years have been stunningly good for the super-rich. The wealth of high-net-worth individuals (Henwis) - those with at least $1m at their disposal, not counting their main home - increased by 11.4 per cent last year to $37trn worldwide. In the UK, the number of Henwis rose from 448,000 to 485,000; you now need \u00a370m to get into the &apos;Rich List&apos; of the 1,000 wealthiest people. Much of that wealth inflation has come from the City, with a record 155 financiers making it into the table.  That has fuelled middle-class envy of the very rich, or what Harvard economist Martin Feldstein calls &apos;spiteful egalitarianism&apos; - the idea that the increasing fortunes of the uber-wealthy are bad, because it makes others feel poor. The middle classes are resentful because they are being priced out of things they consider their birthright, including homes in desirable areas and good schooling. Private fees, for example, have soared by 41 per cent in five years, taking the average costs of a day school to more than \u00a39,600 a year. The rising costs of education and home ownership, coupled with the urge to consume, has driven record numbers into insolvency (see chart). Robert and Lisa, a professional couple in their late forties living in London with two sons, are typical of the families caught in the middle-class squeeze. Although prosperous by most standards, they are beset by financial anxieties. &apos;We live in a five-bedroom terraced house in north London and it has shot up in value since we bought it in 1996,&apos; says Robert. &apos;But our elder son will soon go to secondary school. To get him into a good one, we&apos;d have to move a short distance and pay an extra \u00a3250,000 for the same-sized property near the school. We&apos;re thinking seriously about sending both boys to an independent school because the fees are about the same as moving.  &apos;Foolishly, I failed to join company pension schemes in my twenties and thirties and now regret it. We&apos;re wondering how we are going to juggle all these financial responsibilities at our age. My parents were not enormously wealthy, but my dad had a good job in an accountancy firm and was always home for supper at 6.30 in time to read us stories. I can&apos;t do that with my kids because I have to work such long hours. He lived in London all his life after retiring at 65 on a generous final salary pension scheme - I will have nothing like that.&apos; Middle-class financial woes could be dismissed as the bleatings of the privileged but, at the bottom end of the economic scale, things are also arguably worse. The rich have become richer, but the poor are still relatively poor. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported this year that relative poverty has risen for the first time since Labour came to power, with 12.7 million people - more than a fifth of the population - living in households with incomes lower than 60 per cent of the median after housing costs. A shocking 3.8 million children are classed as living in poverty. Schadenfreude may be satisfying, but a downturn in the City hurts us all, because of the massive increase in its influence on the UK economy as a whole during the golden decade. Financial services has grown from 5.5 per cent of the economy to more than 9 per cent last year and, over the past three years, it has been responsible for a third of overall GDP growth. Manufacturing has gone in the opposite direction, declining as a proportion of the total economy from 23 per cent in 1990 to 14 per cent in 2005. Employment in industry has plunged by more than a million, while financial service sector jobs have grown (see chart).  A report by the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club this year described the City as a &apos;cuckoo in the nest&apos;, crowding out manufacturing and other industries. While it is good to specialise, the report said, this process should be carefully managed. David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says: &apos;The government has no option but to nurture the City because it is a huge economic driver. But manufacturing is still important. It is not an either/or situation. You should be able to have both, as they do in Germany, where they still have world-class manufacturers. The economy is like a tripod: you need strong services, strong manufacturing and a strong public sector. Ours is unbalanced, with manufacturing the poor relation.&apos; The credit crunch has also prompted more soul searching about our high-consumption lifestyle. Edward Bonham Carter, of fund manager Jupiter Asset Management, says: &apos;In every economic cycle, there are excesses on a local level. People have been much better off in the previous decade, but are they happier? Material accumulation does not improve our sense of well-being, and that is intersecting with the climate change debate, where people realise that they have to consume less. It is part of the zeitgeist.&apos; Not that he is advocating a hair-shirt backlash: &apos;The more redistributive you are, the less incentive people have for creating wealth. On the other hand, if you have a rampant capitalist state and do not redistribute it at all, you get rich ghettos and ultimately revolution.&apos; The other great upheaval of 2007 is the shift in the balance of power from the West to the developing world, seen in the rise of sovereign funds investing trillions of dollars of excess savings from China and the Middle East, a trend that accelerated strongly due to the credit crisis. While Northern Rock was bailed out by the government via the Bank of England, others courted rescue from the Chinese state. Morgan Stanley, for example, received a $5bn injection from the China Investment Corp in return for securities that will convert into as much as 9.9 per cent of its stock. Abu Dhabi&apos;s sovereign wealth fund invested $7.5bn in Citigroup last month, and the Singapore government and an unnamed Middle Eastern investor has ploughed SFr13bn (\u00a35.7bn) into Swiss bank UBS. &apos;When you have a sector that is bombed out but with high growth potential, the smart money piles in,&apos; says one chief executive. &apos;I think it is a healthy part of globalisation, but there will be more protectionist noise in America about it, which could be harmful.&apos; Chagrined though they are, leading bankers don&apos;t believe their game is up. The same chief executive adds: &apos;If you take a 10-year view, there is every reason to believe the financial services sector will be one of the fastest growing. Nothing that has happened in the past six months will change some of the big long-term trends, such as the privatisation of the welfare state, or the demographic drivers, such as people living longer. These are behind the development of the financial services industry.&apos; He goes on: &apos;The conditions we have now were created by the pursuit for yield by investors in a low-interest, low-inflation environment. Some of the opaque instruments have gone, but the quest for yield has not vanished and that will drive innovation. The performance of markets over time is being pushed by those very big demographic drivers - it is completely unstoppable.&apos;  In the past 10 years, the City has sealed its transformation from a soporific club for paunchy Old Etonians to a magnet for brilliant young talent. It has unleashed innovations on an uncomprehending world and the pace of financial evolution has far outstripped ability of the relatively underpaid, and sometimes intellectually underpowered, financial regulators to keep up.  Sober critics have been questioning the vertiginous rise of the City for some time. During the good times, this was brushed aside by practitioners and politicians, content to bask in the reflected glory of London&apos;s rise as a financial centre. After Northern Rock, those inconvenient voices have grown to a clamour that must be heard. Are we prepared to live in a less equal and more divided society if that is the price of a booming financial sector? Is it OK for the City to play such an overweening role in our economy, while manufacturing struggles? How else, other than in financial services, might Britain compete in a global economy against emerging nations with cheaper labour and raw materials? Is it desirable for the sovereign funds of sometimes undemocratic foreign governments to gain more control over the levers of capital? All of these are issues for 2008 as we ponder how best to move forward in this chastened new world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/dec/23/communities.population", "sentences": ["Instead, increasing numbers come from countries scattered across the globe - from Germany to Guyana, from Sweden to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T23:56:30Z", "title": "The changing face of British cities by 2020", "tags": ["Communities", "Population", "Society", "UK news", "Leicester"], "article": "At least a dozen British towns and cities will have no single ethnic group in a majority within the next 30 years. Leicester will become the first &apos;super-diverse&apos; city in 2020, then Birmingham in 2024, followed by Slough and Luton, according to a new study of population trends in the UK. The report reveals that Leicester has seen the proportion of its white population fall from 70.1 per cent in 1991 to 59.5 per cent today. By 2016 the white population will make up 52.2 per cent of the population, falling to 44.5 per cent by 2026. &apos;Britain is becoming ever more plural; our diversity ever more diverse,&apos; said Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Sheffield, whose predictions are based on the most comprehensive study into the country&apos;s population trends. &apos;This increased diversity is most evident in its cities, with plurality becoming commonplace.&apos; The immigrant and ethnic populations are no longer characterised by large, well organised Afro-Caribbean and South Asian communities, said Dorling. Instead, increasing numbers come from countries scattered across the globe - from Germany to Guyana, from Sweden to Singapore. &apos;It is going to become increasingly difficult to generalise about Britain&apos;s plurality because different cities are experiencing different levels and types of diversity,&apos; he said. &apos;This creates a complex challenge for those responsible for successfully managing the country&apos;s changing population.&apos; In the Thirties, the proportion of people living in Britain who were born in foreign countries was 2.5 per cent. Typically these individuals came from one of 15 countries, in particular Ireland and India. Today more than 10 per cent of the population were born abroad, with no single ethnic group dominating. Sukhvinder Stubbs, chief executive of the Barrow Cadbury Trust, which commissioned Dorling&apos;s research, said the findings indicate key challenges facing Britain, including a need to reframe the immigration debate and to focus on the changing pressure on the country&apos;s resources. &apos;For Britain&apos;s major urban centres, ethnic diversity is the reality,&apos; she said. &apos;Regardless of future immigration patterns, it is just a matter of time until cities such as Birmingham become plural. Even if we prohibited another single soul from entering the country, the trends have already laid root.&apos; In the period from 1991 to 2026, which will see Leicester&apos;s white population fall from 70.1 per cent to 44.5 per cent, the city&apos;s second largest ethnic group, Indians, is predicted to rise from 22.9 per cent to 26 per cent. The Pakistani population will triple to 3.3 per cent, while the proportion of Africans will rise from 0.4 per cent in 1991 to 11.2 per cent. Birmingham&apos;s transition to plural city status will, however, be markedly different to Leicester&apos;s, added Dorling. The proportion of white people in its population will fall from 77 per cent to 47.7 per cent. But while much of Leicester&apos;s growth in ethnic minorities will be driven by African growth, Birmingham&apos;s population shift will be dominated by those of Pakistani descent. Dorling&apos;s research also looks at the shifts in population patterns in towns that are not expected to become plural in the foreseeable future. Oldham, for example, will remain a town with an overwhelmingly white population. However, it will witness a significant change in its demographic profile, with the town&apos;s white population falling from more than 90 per cent to 74.4 per cent in the 30 years from 1991. &apos;Contrary to popular opinion, Oldham&apos;s ethnic minority population is not homogeneous,&apos; said Dorling. &apos;The town&apos;s second largest ethnic group after whites is Pakistani, but by 2021 there are likely to be as many Bangladeshis in Oldham as there are Pakistanis.&apos; Dorling&apos;s research also shows that, although Greater London&apos;s population is already significantly diverse with a white population of 67.5 per cent, it is not likely to become plural in the near future. By 2026 the white population is predicted to reach 60.7 per cent, with just eight of London&apos;s 33 local authority areas predicted to become plural."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/dec/24/dudeyouregettingadelliny", "sentences": ["In the past several months Dell has announced relationships with Best Buy in the US, DSG International and Carrefour in Europe, Staples in the US, Courts stores in Singapore, Gome stores in China, Bic Camera Inc. in Japan, Carphone Warehouse in the UK and Wal-Mart in the US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-24T11:25:11Z", "title": "Dude, you're getting a Dell in your Tesco shopping basket", "tags": ["Windows", "Software", "Technology sector", "Business", "Computing", "Technology"], "article": "&quot;Beginning next month, customers will be able to purchase Dell XPS and Inspiron products in Tesco stores, primarily in the UK, with sales also in Ireland, Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia,&quot; says a Dell press release.

He was speaking after his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway spent $4.5bn (\u00a32.26bn) on a majority stake in Marmon, a US industrial conglomerate, in one of its biggest ever acquisitions. Several investment banks have sold stakes to outside investors after getting caught in the fallout from the US sub-prime crisis. Abu Dhabi&apos;s sovereign wealth fund is pumping $7.5bn into Citigroup, and Merrill Lynch has agreed a cash infusion of as much as $6.2bn from Singapore&apos;s Temasek fund. Buffett had been rumoured to be planning a similar move into the financial sector. The Marmon deal led some analysts to suggest that the banking industry may not yet have hit the bottom, even though share prices have fallen sharply in recent months. Marmon consists of 125 different businesses, in sectors including transportation equipment, construction and electrical components. Their products include railroad cars, wire and cable, and water treatment kits. Buffett described the deal as &quot;a very large bet on America over a long period of time&quot;.

A university in New Zealand has become the latest in a growing international line to allow its leader to fatten his or her job description with the title &quot;vice-chancellor and president&quot;. The country&apos;s more traditionally minded academic union considers this bunk.  Somebody, perhaps, is being a tad over-sensitive when it comes to the perceived eclipse of this most English (and Welsh) of solitary university titles, the vice-chancellor. In its latest newsletter (seventh item down), New Zealand&apos;s Association of University Staff gently mocks the recent decision by the ruling council at the University of Waikato permitting its vice-chancellor, Roy Crawford, to also refer to himself as president. The announcement marked one of the year&apos;s &quot;more curious&quot; moments, with a &quot;positively odd&quot; explanation to boot, harrumphed the union. In an email, staff at Waikato had been told that the term vice-chancellor is not well understood in many jurisdictions in Asia and North America, where the assumption is that the chancellor is the chief executive, while the vice-chancellor plays second fiddle. To insist on using it in every circumstance risked sowing &quot;confusion and embarrassment&quot;, said the university&apos;s barons. The title of president, on the other hand, is &quot;commonly used and understood in tertiary education sectors globally, and its use serves to eliminate the potential for misunderstanding in international contexts&quot;. Effective immediately, Crawford, who came to his current position from Queen&apos;s University, Belfast, could therefore also be known as President Crawford. Strictly speaking, the supposedly confused Asians and North Americans have it right: a vice-chancellor is in fact a deputy to the chancellor. Although, of course, chancellors are typically prominent public figures who serve as ceremonial leaders only (except in Sweden, where vice-chancellor remains the honorary title). But these distinctions, the Kiwi unionists seem to be saying, have long been understood throughout the world of higher learning, as much so as the chief executive roles of &apos;president&apos;, &apos;principal&apos; and &apos;rector&apos; are readily grasped by those in the respective fields. Still, they might be backing a losing horse here, even within the British Commonwealth. Virtually all the heads of nearby Australia&apos;s 40 universities now opt for the double job title. The same appears to be the case for many of their counterparts in Malaysia, Canada and  Singapore. And let&apos;s not forget one other bastion of antipodean higher learning, the New Zealand Association of University Staff, whose chief executive has long plumped simply for the title of - you guessed it - president."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/dec/30/news.sport2", "sentences": ["January 1 (started 17 Dec) Darts PDC World Championships, Alexandra Palace 5-6 Football FA Cup 3rd rd 5-13 Darts WDF World Darts Championships, Frimley Green, Surrey 6 Football FA Women&apos;s Cup 4th rd 7-27 Bowls World Indoor Championships, Potters Leisure Resort, Norfolk 8 Football Carling Cup semi-final 1st leg, Chelsea v Everton 9 Football Carling Cup semi-final 1st leg, Arsenal v Spurs 11-13 Rugby union Heineken Cup 5th rd 12 Athletics Great North Cross Country, Edinburgh 12 Football Scottish Cup 4th rd 12-13 American football Divisional play-offs 12-27 Bowls World Championships, Burnside Bowling Club, Christchurch, New Zealand 13-20 Snooker Masters, Wembley 13 Basketball BBL Cup final, NIA, Birmingham 14-27 Tennis Australian Open, Melbourne 18-20 Cycling Track World Cup, Los Angeles 18-20 Golf Women&apos;s World Cup of Golf, Gary Player CC, Sun City 18-20 Rugby union Heineken Cup 6th rd 19 Boxing Felix Trinidad v Roy Jones, Madison Square Garden 20 American football Conference Championships 20-10 Feb Football African Nations Cup, Ghana 21-27 Ice skating European Figure Skating Championships, Zagreb 22-23 Football Carling Cup semi-final 2nd legs, Everton v Chelsea, Spurs v Arsenal 24-27 Motor sport Monte Carlo Rally 26 Athletics Norwich Union Indoor International, Glasgow 26-27 Football FA Cup 4th rd 27 Football FA Women&apos;s Cup 5th rd 29 Football CIS Insurance Cup semi-final, Aberdeen v Dundee Utd, Tynecastle 30 Football CIS Insurance Cup semi-final, Rangers v Hearts, Hampden Park February 2 Football Scottish Cup 5th rd 2 Rugby union Six Nations: Ireland v Italy, 2pm;

The pro-Thaksin party has bagged the largest number of seats at polls on December 23. After last year&apos;s coup, Thaksin and his closest cohorts were banned from engaging in politics for five years. His party was dismantled prior to the election. But pro-Thaksin forces readily regrouped under the banner of a new party - the People Power Party - using the offices and machinery of the proscribed Thai Rak Thai party. It was an extraordinary proxy victory for the deposed leader-in-exile, and clearly not the result that the Thai military leaders were hoping for. Though victorious, Thaksin is still far from vindicated. He hovered in Hong Kong during the election and its aftermath, exulting in his apparent comeback. He now wants to return home but faces still faces a raft of corruption charges (on which he predictably proclaims his innocence). While the election was a victory for the well-oiled pro-Thaksin party machine in the north and north-east of Thailand, and a rejection of the military coup, many western media reports of Thaksin being &quot;vindicated&quot; are wrong on several accounts. First, this was no landslide victory. The main opposition force, the Democrat Party, won 165 seats (to PPP&apos;s 233) with a clean sweep of Bangkok, the capital, and as usual dominated constituencies in the south. (The Democrat Party was also opposed to military rule.) Secondly, the manner of the PPP/pro-Thaksin victory in their strongholds is tainted with allegations of massive vote-buying and irregularities. Montri Kiatkhamjorn, a senior officer for the Election Commission, the poll watchdog, in the north-east reckons &quot;maybe 50%&quot; of candidates are buying votes in the region.&quot; Former senator Kraisak Choonhavan, a staunch opponent of all Thailand&apos;s many military regimes, who ran as Democrat candidate in Korat, claims Thaksin poured billions of baht into the region to buy votes, with the active complicity of local administration officials. He claims that 300 baht (4.7 Stg)was paid to 462,700 voters in Korat. If that is true it would add up to \u00a32 million deployed to keep the voters loyal. Given that Thaskin&apos;s fortune has been estimated at $4 billion and he admits to $2 billion, it should come as no surprise that his wealth works wonders among some of the poorest voters in the north-east, which is precisely where his party machine is strongest. Apart from election disputes and alleged vote-buying, Thaksin cannot possibly be vindicated until the many cases of alleged corruption and fraud already filed in the courts during 2007 are judged by the courts. The attorney-general&apos;s office has been pushing for the extradition of Thaksin and his wife from Britain, where the former premier owns a home and has purchased the Manchester City football club for \u00a384 million. Arrest warrants were issued by the supreme court on corruption and graft charges. If he returns home he faces immediate arrest. In addition, a recent inquiry by the National Human Rights Commission found that 2,656 people were killed during Thaksin&apos;s &quot;war on drugs&quot; campaign in 2003 and concluded that the ousted prime minister was guilty of endorsing a shoot-to-kill policy against drug suspects, many of whom were subsequently proved to be innocent. This killing spree by police death squads could have been stopped, but Thaksin has never expressed regrets nor any moral qualms. No matter how popular he may be among certain sections of Thai voters, there is no vindication from the claim made by Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch Asia that Thaksin is &quot;a human rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. Mass protests about Thaksin&apos;s arrogant pursuit of greed was triggered by the sale of his telecom empire to a Singapore state investment body from a whopping tax-free profit while still prime minister in 2006. These massive Bangkok demonstrations against Thaksin&apos;s rule eventually led to a peaceful military coup tacitly endorsed by the royal palace advisers close to Thailand&apos;s revered king. The country has now come the full circle. Military rule has been discredited. The December election has brought back normalisation. &quot;Normal&quot; in Thai politics means rampant vote-buying, weak coalitions, horse-trading and duplicity between the various parties. If the pro-Thaksin PPP can form a new government, their campaign promise includes bringing Thaksin home, amnesty and attempts to do away with the Assets Examination Committee (AEC) tasked with unearthing evidence against their hero. The campaign to rehabilitate Thaksin on the one hand, and the military&apos;s continuing role as self-appointed guardians of society, are the two key issues retarding a full return to democracy. Both Thaksin and the generals that oppose him represent two brands of authoritarian rule: one based on arms and weapons, and the other based on a tainted ballot-box and a huge election spending sprees. But millions of Thai citizens are searching for a third force to lead them out of turmoil and confrontation, and towards much-needed national reconciliation between pro- and anti-Thaksin in voters. Clearly that aspiration cannot be achieved by 72-year-old rightist political dinosaur Samak Sundaravej, the leader of the PPP party and the political nominee of Thaksin in exile. He is as controversial and divisive as Thaksin himself, yet after protracted coalition deals, he will probably become the country&apos;s next prime minister - a prospect that alarms millions in the capital, Bangkok. However, no Thai government can be expected to survive for long without support from Bangkokians in the capital, and without acceptance from professional and business sectors and people that run the country. Thailand will not be able to escape from more rounds of protest demonstrations and rallies, as long as Thaksin or his subalterns keep their unsavoury grip on the nation&apos;s affairs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/30/merrilllynch.subprimecrisis", "sentences": ["The discussions come just days after Thain was forced on Christmas Eve to sell $4.4bn (\u00a32.2bn) of stock to Singapore investment firm Temasek as part of a wider plan to raise some $7.5bn."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-30T23:42:24Z", "title": "Merrill seeks more funds to avoid crisis", "tags": ["Merrill Lynch", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "US economy", "Banking", "Business"], "article": "John Thain, the new chief executive of Merrill Lynch, is this weekend in talks with Chinese and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds that could lead to the sale of another big stake in the US bank in a desperate bid to raise capital, according to sources in London and New York. The discussions come just days after Thain was forced on Christmas Eve to sell $4.4bn (\u00a32.2bn) of stock to Singapore investment firm Temasek as part of a wider plan to raise some $7.5bn.  Merrill Lynch has already taken an $8bn hit related to sub-prime investments, but Wall Street fears that the bank&apos;s problems could go far deeper. &apos;Thain is desperately seeking an additional infusion of foreign capital to bolster Merrill&apos;s balance sheet,&apos; said one source. &apos;It could be done by selling shares or other assets to raise cash.&apos; A US observer said: &apos;The multi-billion cash injection from Temasek was not enough and Thain is taking calls from a host of other potential saviours, which are understood to include sovereign fund investors from the Gulf and China.&apos; Analysts believe that Thain needs funds urgently in a bid to thwart future liquidity problems. The bank has already announced plans to lay off 1,600 staff. &apos;Thain is raising capital in anticipation of a large fourth quarter write-down,&apos; said Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz.  Sources close to Merrill Lynch say that Thain has cancelled New Year leave among his top lieutenants and that his team is working around the clock on various &apos;scenarios&apos; that could be employed to save the bank if problems related to the credit crunch continue to worsen. &apos;It is all hands to the pumps here,&apos; the source said, adding that the possibility of exploring a merger with another banking group had not been ruled out but was considered &apos;an extreme scenario&apos;. &apos;Everything is on the table,&apos; he said. Fears are mounting that Merrill Lynch will be forced to write down between $10bn and $15bn worth of assets related to CDOs - so called collateralised debt obligations - when it reports financial results next month. Stan O&apos;Neal, the bank&apos;s former chief executive, was forced to resign when Merrill revealed write-downs in November. Under strict new accounting rules enforced in 2004 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street banks are required to have certain levels of liquidity to match their obligations, just like ordinary high street banks. This has prompted the likes of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS to seek large cash injections from foreign investors amid the worsening credit crunch.  Aside from the $4.4bn share sale, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its middle-market lending business, Merrill Lynch Capital, to GE Capital, freeing up $1.3bn in equity. The troubled banking group will also sell an additional $1.2bn worth of stock to Davis Selected Advisers. Analysts have so far predicted that the bank will be forced to write down between $10bn and $11.5bn, but the value of the assets affected by the credit crunch is falling in value by the day as the market continues to seek a way out of one of the worst liquidity crises in history."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/dec/30/mytravels", "sentences": ["MY PERFECT HOLIDAY WOULD BE... A week upriver in Borneo with the Iban people, followed by a week of good food, good plumbing and old friends at the Grand Hyatt Singapore, followed by a week&apos;s refuge by the pool at the Raleigh in South Beach, Miami, a few beers at my favourite dive bar (Mac&apos;s Club Deuce) and some cheap tacos across the street.", "As for airline food, I try to avoid that too, unless I&apos;m on a 20-hour flight on Singapore Airlines."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-30T23:48:00Z", "title": "Me and my travels: Anthony Bourdain", "tags": ["Travel", "Anthony Bourdain"], "article": "MY TOP TRAVEL TIP IS... Eat as the locals do. Avoid any restaurant where there are more than two of your own countrymen. Drink plenty of indigenous beverage. And let things happen. I NEVER TRAVEL WITHOUT... An iPod, and (when possible) the right music for the right setting. Little on earth cannot be improved by an appropriate soundtrack. An example of a perfect match of music to environment was a recent trip by rail from London to Edinburgh. I had the title music of Get Carter on my headphones. Even better than reality. MY IDEA OF PARADISE IS... A beach. A palm tree. Bare feet. My wife and daughter. A frosty beer. A thick book. No plans. I&apos;M IN NO HURRY TO RETURN TO... Uzbekistan. The food was not good. And an atmosphere of friendliness did not, shall we say, prevail. Beautiful structures of enormous historical significance are not enough, particularly when they are offset by some of the worst Soviet-Modern architecture on earth. And the Fearless Leader is one ugly, scary looking mug. Seeing his face once is bad enough. Seeing it everywhere is depressing. MY FAVOURITE HOTEL IS... The Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. I love. It almost makes LA worth going to. Comfy, private, old, slightly dysfunctional, casual and famously non-judgmental. You feel that if you showed up for breakfast having forgotten to put on your trousers, no one would notice or care. The rooms feel like home - with antique 1940s-style kitchens - so you never feel like you&apos;re waking up in just another hotel.  THE LUXURY I CAN&apos;T LIVE WITHOUT ON HOLIDAY IS... Some really good plumbing every once in a while. In fact, a few days of deprivation - of washing yourself in cold water from a pail and crapping in a ditch, for instance - make one&apos;s first hot, high-pressure shower all the more pleasurable. If you spend as much time as I do in longhouses - or Soviet-quality chain hotels - good sheets, lots of clean, fluffy towels and a toilet that actually flushes take on near-iconic importance. GOOD SERVICE IS... Casual, friendly and reasonably efficient - and a properly poured beer. Beyond that, I&apos;m a man of simple needs. I hate obsequious service. I don&apos;t want to be called &apos;Mister&apos; anything. Just say, &apos;How ya doin&apos; and get me a beer in good time and without bugs in it and I&apos;m happy. WHEN I&apos;M TRAVELLING I ALWAYS MISS... My crew. They&apos;re professionals. They&apos;ve seen me at my very worst. I&apos;ve seen them at theirs.  MY PERFECT HOLIDAY WOULD BE... A week upriver in Borneo with the Iban people, followed by a week of good food, good plumbing and old friends at the Grand Hyatt Singapore, followed by a week&apos;s refuge by the pool at the Raleigh in South Beach, Miami, a few beers at my favourite dive bar (Mac&apos;s Club Deuce) and some cheap tacos across the street.  THE THING I HATE MOST ABOUT TRAVEL IS... Being away from my family. As a new dad, that&apos;s increasingly problematic. Fortunately, my infant daughter is a very good traveller.  WHEN TRAVELLING I ALWAYS EAT... Street food, local specialities and pretty much whatever is offered. I avoid hotel food at all costs. As for airline food, I try to avoid that too, unless I&apos;m on a 20-hour flight on Singapore Airlines. MY WORST HOLIDAY EVER WAS TO... St Bart&apos;s - it is the epicentre of evil. If Lenin or Marx ever saw who really runs this world - and what they do for fun - they would never have become socialists. They would simply have killed themselves from despair and revulsion. Caligula would have been shocked. It is so awful as to be beyond parody. After my week on St Bart&apos;s, I crawled under my bed, adopted the foetal position and just lay there whimpering for days.  \u00b7 Anthony Bourdain&apos;s latest book, &apos;No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach&apos;, is published by Bloomsbury"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/dec/31/uk.eu", "sentences": ["The UK is billed as &quot;an endemic surveillance society&quot; alongside Russia, the US, Singapore and China in the survey of 47 countries by Privacy International (PI)."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-31T00:07:00Z", "title": "Britain rated worst in Europe for protecting privacy", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "European Union", "Human rights", "Privacy", "World news", "UK civil liberties", "Surveillance", "Law"], "article": "Britain, the country with the world&apos;s biggest network of surveillance cameras, has the worst record in Europe for the protection of privacy, according to a report from a London-based international watchdog. The UK is billed as &quot;an endemic surveillance society&quot; alongside Russia, the US, Singapore and China in the survey of 47 countries by Privacy International (PI). Britain is bottom in Europe because of its cameras, ID card plans and lack of government accountability. Rankings are given for the UK as a whole as well as for its individual nations. &quot;For the first time, Scotland has been given its own ranking score and performed significantly better than England and Wales,&quot; says the report. Simon Davies, director of PI, said the loss this year of computer discs containing personal and bank details of 25 million UK families claiming child benefit highlighted the risks of storing information on huge government databases. The report concludes that the 2007 rankings &quot;show an increasing trend among governments to archive data on the geographic, communications and financial records of all their citizens and residents. This trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens, regardless of legal status, are under suspicion. &quot;The impact was worst in the US and across the EU as governments boosted surveillance and information gathering in the name of security and protecting borders.&quot; The US performed worst among democratic countries in terms of &quot;statutory protections and privacy enforcement&quot;. In the European league table Germany fell from first to seventh, replaced at the top by Greece with its green ranking, indicating &quot;significant protections and safeguards&quot; for privacy. Romania, Hungary and Slovenia take the next three places. Surveillance measures initiated by Brussels have caused a substantial decline in privacy across the EU, says the report. Canada heads the international table, with Argentina, Iceland and Switzerland close behind. Malaysia is bottom, with a score marginally lower than Britain&apos;s. The PI report says immigration and border control concerns in 2007 have prompted countries to &quot;implement database, identity and fingerprinting systems, often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/31/subprimecrisis.creditcrunch", "sentences": ["A succession of Wall Street banks have turned to sovereign funds in China, Singapore and the Middle East for injections of cash."], "publicationDate": "2007-12-31T11:10:24Z", "title": "From the sub-prime to the ridiculous: how $100bn vanished", "tags": ["US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Credit crunch", "Housing market", "House prices", "Banking", "Economics", "Business"], "article": "It began with low-income Americans being encouraged to borrow mortgages they couldn&apos;t afford.  The economic butterfly effect would eventually cause deals worth billions of dollars to fall apart; the first run on a British bank in 140 years; some of the most powerful figures on Wall Street losing their jobs; wild gyrations on the markets; and dire warnings that the world is on the brink of recession. At the start of the year, stockmarkets were at six-year highs and \u00a340bn worth of mergers and takeovers were awaiting completion. Private equity firms and hedge funds were gorging themselves on cheap money and a handful of secretive, hugely wealthy individuals were becoming increasingly influential. But it was the millions on more modest incomes who would ultimately shape the events of 2007. As the US housing market cooled and interest rates rose, many on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder found it difficult to meet their monthly mortgage repayments.  The first real concerns about sub-prime mortgages emerged at the end of February, when Wall Street suffered its worst day since the terrorist attacks of 2001. By April one of the biggest sub-prime mortgage lenders in the US had gone bankrupt and there was talk of a full-blown crisis. Credit more broadly began to dry up as lenders became nervous.  Fear also spread as it became clear that much of the bad debt had been packaged up and sold on around the world&apos;s financial system. Nobody, not even the banks themselves, knew who owned the toxic debt. Some otherwise arcane practices of the financial world such as collateralised debt obligations and structured investment vehicles suddenly became everybody&apos;s concern. The flood of private equity money turned into a trickle as it became more difficult to borrow, derailing deals including an attempt to buy J Sainsbury and, at the close of the year, an attempt by Lord Harris to take Carpetright private. Hedge funds too, which rely on leveraging their funds, have had their wings clipped. The credit crunch was behind the biggest story of the year, Northern Rock. It emerged in September that the bank had been forced to apply to the Bank of England for emergency funds as liquidity had dried up in the market. Savers were told not to panic. But they did anyway. The next day, there were long lines of people threading through high streets across Britain, hoping to retrieve their cash. The scenes triggered a postmortem into how a major bank - the fifth biggest provider of mortgages in the country - could reach the brink of collapse without any apparent action to prevent it from going under.  The inquest has so far given us the phrase &quot;moral hazard&quot; from the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, who believed it was outside his remit to rescue a bank that had got into difficulties through risky borrowing on international money markets. It has also given us the sight of MPs from the Treasury select committee grappling to discover who from the much lauded tripartite structure of regulation for the UK financial system - the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority - was to blame for the fiasco. But it has not given us any definitive answers save that Northern Rock should not have risked so much on such a finely calibrated business model and should have seen it coming. King came under pressure to quit but no one from the tripartite system has fallen on their sword. Even the architect of the business model, Northern Rock&apos;s chief executive Adam Applegarth, hung on until the middle of November when he finally resigned. The stricken bank has received \u00a325bn of taxpayers&apos; cash. There are still two potential bidders - Sir Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin and the Olivant vehicle led by former Abbey National boss Luqman Arnold. Other options include nationalisation or a carve-up among high street banks.  As the mortgage crisis spread, Wall Street bosses began dropping like neatly lined-up dominoes. Stan O&apos;Neal was forced out at Merrill Lynch and Charles Prince was ousted from the world&apos;s largest banking group, Citigroup. The most powerful woman on Wall Street, Zoe Cruz, lost her job at Morgan Stanley when the bank recorded losses of $3.7bn. Another Wall Street bank, Bear Stearns, suffered the first loss in its 84-year history. The numbers just kept getting bigger. This month the Swiss bank UBS wrote off a further $10bn of sub-prime loans, on top of $3.4bn already announced. Two days later the Bank of England joined other central banks in pouring \u00a350bn into the financial markets in the hope of staving off a meltdown. A succession of Wall Street banks have turned to sovereign funds in China, Singapore and the Middle East for injections of cash. The unravelling of events has been a stunning example of how interdependent the world economy has become.  Confidence appears to be ebbing. Retailers in Britain were forced to slash prices before Christmas to shift stock. According to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, house prices in Britain are falling at their fastest rate in two years. The outlook for jobs is the worst for a decade. Jon Hunt, who sold the estate agency Foxtons in April, may, it turns out, have called the top of the market.
