They ended up in Liverpool and from there were sold straight into the heart of the NHS. As the criminal investigation continues into how a fake consignment of Zyprexa, an anti-psychotic treatment prescribed for schizophrenia, infiltrated Britain&apos;s healthcare system last year, evidence is mounting that sophisticated counterfeiting syndicates are increasingly targeting Britain&apos;s network of high-street chemists, hospitals and GP surgeries. Figures collated for the first time reveal that British border officials seized more than half a million counterfeit pills destined for the NHS and high-street chemists last year, an amount equal to the quantity of counterfeit drugs found in the whole of Europe in 2005. So vast is the scale of the threat from fake medicines that public confidence in the NHS could be &quot;completely undermined&quot;, according to legal experts. Health officials also warn that the health of millions of Britons is potentially at risk.  More than \u00a33m of fake life-saving medicines for ailments such as heart disease and cancer were intercepted by customs officials and the Home Office border agency in the first 10 months of 2008. Three consignments were each larger than 100,000 pills. In response, customs has upgraded tackling the trade in fake medicines to &quot;high priority&quot;, the same urgency devoted to targeting heroin and cocaine dealers. Interpol recently revealed it was investigating reports that profits from counterfeit drugs are funding terrorist groups, including al-Qaida. Others warn that smuggling counterfeit drugs into Britain&apos;s healthcare network could prove to be a terrorist weapon in itself. Latest government intelligence indicates that criminal gangs operating largely out of China have shifted away from selling fake &quot;lifestyle&quot; drugs such as Viagra on the internet and are now concentrating on supplying counterfeit &quot;life-saving&quot; medicines to the NHS. Profits are potentially greater, with the high price of medicines in the UK ensuring that it has emerged as a prime target for criminals, according to the government agency that oversees the safety of medicines, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Mick Deats, a former Scotland Yard detective chief superintendent who heads the agency&apos;s intelligence and enforcement unit, said: &quot;Criminals are branching out and we are seeing counterfeit drugs that treat prostate cancer, for example, moving into the healthcare system.&quot; Covert monitoring of email traffic, &quot;computer forensics&quot; and telephone calls pinpoint China as the principal hub for the manufacture of Britain&apos;s counterfeit medicines. The Observer has learned that Chinese police authorities recently travelled to London to discuss the growing problem.  Deats said all available evidence confirmed a sharp growth in the trade of counterfeit drugs. Major recalls of fake medicines have been ordered by the agency on 14 occasions in the last three years, compared with just one in the previous decade. In addition, four criminal investigations are proceeding into fake treatments found within the official healthcare supply chain. Among them are the consignment of Zyprexa, 40,000 doses of Casodex, a hormone treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer, and Plavix, a blood thinner. Yet the British authorities admit it is impossible to calculate the quantity of fake medicines entering the UK or their potential health impact.  Graham Satchwell, the former head of Scotland Yard&apos;s organised crime group, who has spent years investigating the counterfeit drugs trade, believes significant numbers of Britons may already have died as a result of fake medicines. Although no deaths from counterfeit drugs have been recorded, Satchwell said the very nature of fake medicines meant patients may have died without counterfeit drugs being blamed. &quot;They may have less of the active ingredient, meaning people could die because they are not receiving their life-saving treatment. Even now, though, healthcare professionals never assume it is the drug. No one asks whether deaths are attributable to fake medicines,&quot; said Satchwell.  However, forensic examinations of fake treatments have revealed toxic impurities such as anti-freeze and tiny amounts of the active ingredient, if there are any at all.  The size of the problem facing the NHS is now so great that Interpol&apos;s secretary-general, Ronald Noble, opened an anti-counterfeiting conference in Africa recently by admitting to being &quot;shocked&quot; at discovering that fake drugs were more deadly than terrorism. Forty years of terrorism, he said, had killed 65,000 people, compared with 200,000 in one year alone in China from counterfeit medicines.  At what is described as the largest trade fair in the world, thousands of foreign buyers flock to southern China twice a year to order the country&apos;s latest exports. Now Canton Fair, Guangzhou, has come to the attention of the British police, following claims that criminal gangs are placing huge orders for counterfeit drugs destined for the UK.  Thousands of firms are currently engaged in China&apos;s new growth business. Experts admit they cannot always spot fake drugs in packaging made using state-of-the-art printing and blisterfoil machines. Recently the manufacturers of an anti-malarial drug added a hologram to its blisterfoil to beat the fakers. Within a month, criminals had successfully replicated their efforts.  From China, the fake medicines head west, typically passing through the transit point of Dubai, then the porous borders of Europe. Here the route becomes increasingly opaque. Intelligence reports from the medicines agency show that a single consignment of drugs can change hands up to 30 times before it reaches a British high-street chemist. With frequent repackaging taking place, detection of fake goods is notoriously difficult, with police admitting that odds are weighted in the criminals&apos; favour. Research last month confirmed that just 0.1% of goods entering the UK are physically inspected by customs officers, suggesting the 500,000 intercepted in 2008 is likely to be a fraction of the true picture. The National Audit Office believes that the UK is one of the easiest places in the EU to smuggle counterfeit goods, due to a lack of checks. Once within the UK, drugs are distributed via Britain&apos;s network of pharmaceutical wholesalers. Satchwell said that cash-conscious NHS trusts were encouraged to buy drugs as cheaply as possible.  Satchwell, a former director of security at GlaxoSmithKline, added: &quot;There are hundreds of dealers, and they are selling drugs as legitimate and genuine materials. Once it has been sold to the dealer, it can go anywhere in the NHS.&quot; Even double-checking batch numbers is no defence, with medicines agency investigations revealing that details of legitimate batch numbers have been copied in China&apos;s counterfeiting factories. Deats said NHS trusts should avoid deals that looked too good to be true. &quot;The message is that if you are offered medicines from an unusual source at an unusual price from an unusual country, chances are there is something wrong with them,&quot; he said.  British investigators have found Casodex, whose wholesale price is \u00a3128 for a pack of 28 pills, being offered by Chinese gangs for less than \u00a35.  John Newton, intellectual property rights manager for Interpol, said: &quot;Criminals use existing supply chains. It&apos;s very hard to detect.&quot; Interpol&apos;s latest profiling describes the modern organised criminal as &quot;like a commodities broker&quot; rather than the stereotyped shadowy underworld figure. A shipment that successfully penetrates the UK supply chain can lead to profits in excess of \u00a31m. &quot;They can make four times the money and only risk a fine. Penalties don&apos;t reflect the nature of a crime that can kill people,&quot; said Gary Noon, chief executive of Aegate, a British firm that has introduced a bar code to determine whether a pharmaceutical is authentic. Of the fake batches known to have infiltrated Britain&apos;s healthcare system, some include the cholesterol-reducing treatment Lipitor. Three years ago 2,523 packs of fake Lipitor were sold in Britain. Details obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that only 359 of those packs were ever recovered.  The nightmare scenario is that a batch containing lethal substances will one day penetrate the NHS. Last year EU customs officers intercepted counterfeit drugs containing brick dust with yellow paint and furniture polish. In the developing world, mass casualties are already frequent. More than 13,000 children in China were treated following release of a tainted batch of infant milk formula, while scores of youngsters died in Haiti after swallowing paracetamol cough syrup containing toxic diethylene glycol.  Yet quantifying the threat to Britain remains impossible, according to the medicines agency. The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 1% of prescriptions in the developed world a year are fake, equating to around 8m in Britain. Deats believes the true UK figure is significant - in the millions - but potentially smaller. Yet the growth in trade is increasingly a concern. Hundreds of counterfeit factories have been shut down in China, yet the output of fake drugs has grown. Noble recently cited research that global counterfeit drugs sales will rise to more than $75bn by 2010, a 90% increase in five years. The United Nations drug control board believes trafficking and abuse of prescription drugs has overtaken the use of all illegal narcotics except cannabis.  In the short term, the European commission is considering introducing new rules, such as banning the repackaging of medicines and the mandatory use of special seals to stop counterfeiters. In addition, companies such as Aegate have opened discussions with the NHS over the implementation of their bar codes to determine whether a drug is genuine, following successful trials in Europe.  But as long as criminals can harvest enormous profits, British patients will remain vulnerable. &quot;The counterfeiters target the weakest members of our societies - the young, the sick, the economically disadvantaged, and it is our obligation to take action,&quot; said Noble."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com//Public/art-of-public-strategy", "sentences": ["His canvas is not just his own rich personal experience of UK government - specifically his time in charge of the Prime Minister&apos;s Strategy Unit - but North America, Australia and New Zealand, Singapore, anywhere examples are to be found of governments making an effort to link their wishes and intentions to outcomes, delivered by a machine of state."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-08T17:04:00Z", "title": "Geoff Mulgan's book says government can make the world better", "tags": ["Policy", "Leadership and management", "Best practice", "Public Leaders Network"], "article": "The Art of Public Strategy. Mobilizing Power and knowledge for the common good, by Geoff Mulgan, Oxford, \u00a325 Through Geoff Mulgan&apos;s arteries courses the zeitgeist. Ever since he founded Demos in the 1990s, it&apos;s been hard to map the space within which policy gets thought about without navigating through the great archipelago of ideas and action he is associated with as a thinktanker, civil servant and Blairite policy adviser (who was a Brown adviser before and after that fact). I did, I admit, have a qualm or two when David Cameron&apos;s star was ascendant. Could Geoff really be missing a trend to the right? But here is his new book, obviously written before the credit crunch took hold and Barack Obama reinvented American government, capturing the idea that - to coin the phrase - government can. With policies or rather with strategies, government can make the world a better place. That&apos;s either banal or profoundly ideological. Mulgan doesn&apos;t argue the toss. His book is a typically wide-ranging set of observations about how government (usually nation states) can organise themselves and the administrative furniture to bring about beneficial change. His canvas is not just his own rich personal experience of UK government - specifically his time in charge of the Prime Minister&apos;s Strategy Unit - but North America, Australia and New Zealand, Singapore, anywhere examples are to be found of governments making an effort to link their wishes and intentions to outcomes, delivered by a machine of state. Mulgan&apos;s observations are judicious and he writes fluently. But maybe readers will wish he had painted in more detail. Mulgan&apos;s chapter entitled &quot;how can governments know enough to govern&quot; is more of an amuse-bouche than a full meal. It skates when the reader might wish to dig in. &quot;The ability of civil servants to be intelligent users and customers of different disciplines has fallen behind.&quot; Given his experience at the heart of government - and now at the Young Foundation - that deserves much more exposition than it gets. Mulgan claims credit for inventing the phrase &quot;joined-up government&quot;, which he inserted into an early prime ministerial speech by Tony Blair. But his chapter on the theme is unsatisfying. Bureaucracies, such as Whitehall departments, behave as they do not because they want to expand their empires but because they value their autonomy - &quot;that is to say relatively undisputed jurisdiction&quot;. Mulgan recommends creating new structures to tackle cross-cutting problems, though every new structure relocates the problems of boundaries and autonomy. He concedes the quest for coordination is the 20th-century equivalent of the Renaissance alchemist&apos;s search for the formula to translate base metal into gold - giving not an inch, however, to those who would say that because the problems of government are large and possibly insoluble, the project of good (or rather bettering) government should therefore be abandoned.

Dressed in black tie, on Thursday night the London mayor for the first time addressed City fathers in the imposing splendour of the Mansion House banqueting hall opposite the Bank of England. The assembled elders, financiers and London councillors sat patiently through Johnson&apos;s stream-of-consciousness blather, all the while waiting to hear whether the eccentric Tory had words of comfort to the denizens of the Square Mile in the midst of the most profound financial shock seen for 80 years. Eventually, he got there. &quot;I know there are people who believe what is happening will deliver an irredeemable knock. I have to say those fears are overdone,&quot; he boomed defiantly to 350 high-powered London figures, who growled approvingly. &quot;We may feel justifiable rage against bankers. But we have to stand up for the sector.&quot; And the work started in earnest last week when Treasury ministers, regulators and Square Mile grandees returned to their desks en masse after the Christmas break for what will be a pivotal year. The grim and sobering challenge is to rehabilitate the City after a devastating 15 months.  Rehabilitation means working out a way to get banks to lend to businesses and consumers. It means reforming banking structures as well as constructing a completely new regulatory and supervisory regime to take in how much money banks have to hold in reserve, appropriate lending levels, new transparency protocols and the controversial issue of executive remuneration. Whether it is possible is another matter. &quot;Everybody in financial services needs to put their best foot forward in 2009 because I think we are talking about potentially reshaping financial markets and its participants - and this clearly has implications for many years to come,&quot; argues the influential Robert Talbut, chief investment officer at Royal London Asset Management. &quot;There&apos;s clearly a reasonable view that financial markets failed, and regulators need to ensure their proposed reforms are going to be in tune with the times and are also constructive to help rebuild confidence.&quot;  At stake is not just the future of the hedge fund, credit derivative, private equity and investment banking industries in London, but the entire bedrock of the UK economy. The explosion in financial services that was unleashed after the deregulatory &quot;Big Bang&quot; in 1986 saw London overtake New York to become the money capital of the world. A staggering \u00a32.15 trillion of capital flowed into the UK in 2007 - some \u00a3295bn more than the US (see map). What were considered to be the smartest minds around the world flocked to the city where stratospheric fortunes were made in double-quick time. They don&apos;t seem so clever now. That said, the &quot;gilded City&quot; ensured restaurants, theatres, art galleries and designers all became indispensable props in the triumphant march of Mammon. All told, financial services contributed \u00a3165bn to the UK economy. Nearly half of that came from the City of London and Canary Wharf.  But in January 2009, the Square Mile is a paranoid, shell-shocked place. Tens of thousands of jobs have gone; in total, more than 80,000 are expected to be clearing their desks. Even the most experienced grandees have no clue about the shape of things to come.  &quot;Nobody can count on their job,&quot; says an equity trader at Nomura in Canary Wharf. &quot;Everybody knows good people out of work. There are stories of bosses having to fire whole teams, then [being] kept behind [after work] to be fired themselves.&quot; Senior figures in the City believe more big-name institutions, hedge funds and property companies will go to the wall. There is major concern over banks&apos; exposure to credit card debt, which has still to fully unwind. Some authoritative insiders suggest up to 80% of hedge funds will be wiped out this year. One senior hedge fund manager working at a profitable business says her fund is successful but may be forced under by banks desperate to redeem cash to shore up their own shattered balance sheets. From its peak of 500,000 in June 2007, Corporation of London boss Stuart Fraser estimates that around 17% of the financial workforce (about 85,000) will be axed, though he accepts the shake-out could be worse. Financial services&apos; contribution to UK GDP is set to fall from 13% to 11% - equivalent to a loss of \u00a325bn. That loss could increase: new financial centres are moving in as London&apos;s reputation takes a battering. Singapore is aggressively marketing itself as a wealth management hub. Dubai is pouring billions into plans to become a finance centre. Dublin and Luxembourg have become bases for fund administration. Paris is working on plans to tempt private equity firms with low tax rates.  The government&apos;s City minister, Paul Myners, plays down the threat. &quot;Other centres have emerged where they develop specific excellence: reinsurance in Bermuda; funds administration in Luxembourg or Dublin. It&apos;s quite difficult to contemplate any other centres in the next couple of decades becoming large and all-embracing in their range of activity. There are some threats that may not be sustainable: tax incentives may not be sustainable, but they can give temporary advantage.&quot; From his Treasury office, Myners, himself a former City grandee, makes clear what the Square Mile has to fear most: &quot;The biggest threat is failure to keep our image. This is about innovation and also a failure to maintain confidence in our institutions and our structural frameworks. A year ago, one could say regulation could be an area where you chose to be competitive... I think we are in an environment now where people will seek evidence of strong and effective regulation as a precondition to wanting to do business. There&apos;s going to be more evidence of capital. We are in a mindset where safety and probity are highly valued.&quot; Even the outriders of light-touch regulation accept the new reality. When financial grandee Lord Levene was Lord Mayor in the late 90s, Michael Cassidy was chairman of the City&apos;s policy and resource committee. Effectively, they were president and prime minister of the Square Mile. Together they travelled the world promoting London as the place to do business. Now Cassidy says: &quot;I was an arch-exponent of light-touch regulation. But I&apos;m happy to concede the world has changed. A lot of the more exotic products will disappear.&quot; Big Bang changed the City from a sleepy British backwater to an international playground for mega banks, aggressive hedge funds, highly leveraged private equity players and sellers of arcane debt instruments. But the financial sluice gates have now been firmly closed: the big US banks have either been wiped out or humbled, while private equity and hedge funds are on the ropes.  After surviving two world wars as well as countless downturns, there seems little doubt London&apos;s financial centre will reinvent itself. Businesses such as shipping, foreign exchange and commodities, where it has long had an edge, remain sources of strength and financiers are looking to new potential growth areas such as green technology and Sharia-compliant banking for Muslim customers. The talk in the City is of swapping Porsches for Peugeots and returning to &quot;plain vanilla&quot; banking. And respected figures suggest that to get credit markets working the government needs to create a &quot;good bank/bad bank&quot; model in which toxic assets can be separated.  Jon Moulton, the managing partner of private equity firm Alchemy, who repeatedly warned about the perils of a debt-fuelled boom years before the storm broke, says new models are desperately needed: &quot;The only way London can return to anywhere near its former glory is by being radical in setting up new structures. Tinkering and sticking-plasters will not do it. We need trustworthy banks. That means simple, manageable and regulatable banks.&quot; While government and regulators will take centre stage in 2009, shareholders will also come under scrutiny. Myners believes that, as the owners of banks and other businesses, shareholders have to be far more rigorous, stamping down on excessive executive pay and quizzing company bosses over strategy.  &quot;If shareholders want a strong voice they will need to have the ability to hold management to account,&quot; says Talbut. &quot;I think there&apos;s a sense that we have not done a good job preventing the excesses and we are going to have to become better to provide that oversight - being more demanding, prepared to say &apos;no&apos;, being intrusive and ensuring we are appropriate guardians of people&apos;s money.&quot; By October, new Financial Services Authority rules designed to ensure that banks have enough cash to withstand economic shocks should be in place. One of the reasons credit markets are still sealed up despite the injection of hundreds of billions of pounds in taxpayers&apos; cash and guarantees is because banks are hoarding money in the expectation that they will need more reserves to comply with new regulations. &quot;At the moment, I would characterise the state of mind of a number of our bankers as remaining in the shallow end of the pool, clinging onto the rail,&quot; says Myners. &quot;They need to become more comfortable in getting to the deeper end.&quot;  Whichever way you look at it, in 2009 it&apos;s sink or swim for the City."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/11/lance-armstrong-tour-down-under", "sentences": ["The Astana squad flew in to Adelaide from Europe via Singapore for the UCI ProTour race, which starts on 18 January and marks the return of the seven-time Tour de France winner to professional competition three years after he retired."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-11T14:30:24Z", "title": "Cycling: Lance Armstrong arrives in Australia to prepare for the Tour Down Under", "tags": ["Tour de France 2009", "Lance Armstrong", "Tour de France", "Cycling", "Sport"], "article": "Lance Armstrong arrived in Australia today in preparation for his return to competitive cycling a few hours after his Astana team and a few days ahead of when Tour Down Under officials indicated he would. The Astana squad flew in to Adelaide from Europe via Singapore for the UCI ProTour race, which starts on 18 January and marks the return of the seven-time Tour de France winner to professional competition three years after he retired. Armstrong was said by race officials earlier today to still be training at his base in Hawaii, and that he might not arrive in Australia until midweek. But Armstrong was then shown in television footage later in the day arriving at Sydney airport, about a 75-minute flight from Adelaide. The Astana team manager, Sean Yates, said that the team would train without its star for the first part of the week but he did not believe that would be a problem heading into the first race of the season. &quot;Lance has been training very hard.

While in Adelaide he will appear at two major functions, including one run by the Cancer Council of South Australia. As well as the Tour Down Under, his race schedule for 2009 will include the Giro d&apos;Italia and an attempt to win an unprecedented eighth Tour de France. Writing on his blog recently, Armstrong said preparations for the new season were very different from what he had been involved with in the past, having started his training in the summer of 2008 in the United States. &quot;I&apos;ve spent months and months in the gym trying to build back a certain level of strength that I think I&apos;ll need, not just strength but core stability,&quot; he said.

Are they disfigured by all too evident slums? Is the police presence very obvious on the streets. Does it look heavy-handed, too? Does the citizenry look cheerful and prosperous, or miserable, cowed and poor? By such tests, Malaysia, where I spent some time over Christmas, looks prosperous and promising, a fast-industrialising state whose middle class inhabitants seem to want roughly what we want \u2013 and are in the process of getting, or even exceeding, it. That is really the lesson from all over Asia now: they want what Europe, North America and Australasia have. Japan, then Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, did it first. The others are fast catching up, though bad economic and political policies can derail progress \u2013 oppression in Burma and North Korea today, corruption a generation ago in the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos, whose fall I witnessed in Manilla in 1986.I know: I&apos;m a tourist on holiday in the tourist areas, someone merely observing the surface of things and reading the local papers, which seem lively enough. When in Sarawak, an hour&apos;s flight across the South China Sea \u2013 &quot;the other side&quot;, as Malaysians put it \u2013 I took quite a shine to the Borneo Post, which has lots to read, even the occasional article on the economic travails of Premier Brown. Unsurprisingly, Malaysia and its near-neighbour, the overwhelming city state of Singapore, share many of the problems we all share with the rest of the world, its leaders offering reasons why they should survive the global recession better than some. Why Malaysia, which took such a beating in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 after a decade of 8% annual growth under Dr Mahathir Mohamad? Partly because it claims to have learned lessons, like better regulation, partly because it is more diversified economically now, and probably better run too. As for Singapore, rents are falling on the retail strip that is Orchard Road (it makes Oxford Street look a bit cheesy) and growth was only 1.5% last year. But it, too, expects to batten down the hatches and get through the typhoon year of 2009 in good order. Malaysia is more striking because everyone knows that Singapore \u2013 like Hong Kong before it \u2013 has successfully managed to combine efficient market economies with a strong legal system and reasonably open politics, albeit with an authoritarian strain. On the last occasion I spent a few days in Singapore (only a half-day stopover this year), I quickly longed to see a bit of litter. When I finally spotted a fag packet on the roadside, my host explained: &quot;Today&apos;s a public holiday, it will be gone tomorrow.&quot; I&apos;m sure it was. But Malaysia is a predominantly Muslim state, where the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition has been in power since independence from Britain. That initially happened in 1957, and has taken its current federated form since 1963: Chinese Singapore broke away in 1965 and ethnic tensions between the main groups, Malay (65%), Chinese (27%) Indian (8%) have never quite gone away. The opposition three-party coalition made unprecedented gain in last March&apos;s elections, though it is not without internal tensions too. There was political chicanery and anti-government demos, poorly policed, in 2007. Dr Mahathir urged Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, his successor as PM since 2003, to quit after the March setback (sound familiar?), and one of the ruling coalition&apos;s Borneo factions threatened to defect on the grounds that they were &quot;made to sleep near the toilet&quot; in the government&apos;s coalition bungalow. A lively metaphor, but Malaysia&apos;s is a Westminster-style system and it staggers on. Where did my sense of optimism stem from in Kuala Lumpur and later in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, the south-west chunk of north Borneo, just two degrees north of the equator? Not from the twinned Petronas Towers, briefly the world&apos;s tallest building, in whose shopping malls we trundled. Striking though they look, they also look like someone \u2013 Mahathir? \u2013 trying too hard. It came mainly from the evidence of well-dressed families playing with their kids in well-planned parks over the Christmas break (now a near-universal celebration, complete with Silent Night in the shopping malls and hotels), of the absence of policemen \u2013 and even the absence of bad drains, the kind that can stop visitors in their tracks in much of Asia (India for example). Oh yes, something I have previously noticed in Malaysia, a moderate Sunni Islam society, is the conspicuous presence of assertive Muslim women leading what look very normal lives in which their faith has been integrated with modern secular aspirations of the kind Guardian readers share. You can see it from the way they dress (there are some very fashionable hijabs), talk and generally conduct themselves in public. But the most striking thing, to my mind, was the absence of slums. I am sure there is still a lot of rural poverty and backwardness. Parts of Sarawak and neighbouring Saba are still pretty remote, and much of the peninsula \u2013 the long finger down from Thailand and Burma \u2013 are not as developed as KL and the south. But slums can be hard to hide, even on the trip to the airport, in many countries. What was much more in evidence \u2013 in provincial Kuching as well as sprawling KL, its core population of 1.6 million \u2014 was mile upon mile of middle class, two-storey, brick homes of a kind you might find being built, unimaginatively, by Barratt or Wimpey, albeit without the wide verandas which protect Asians from their rain. If you moved into one of these houses, terraced or semi-detatched (and you could quite comfortably and not miss a big match in the Premier League on your huge flat screen TV), you would be glad of extra shelter from tropical rain, though cross about the absence of decent buses. In its new affluence, middle class Malaysia seems to drive. No surprise there either, though what it means for the planet is something I suspect that many Malaysians, in their rush to prosperity, regard as someone else&apos;s worry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/13/oil-price-opec-energy", "sentences": ["&quot;Given that we&apos;re likely to see quite a few rather poor fourth quarter earnings reports, downward pressure will continue to be exerted on oil,&quot; said Victor Shum, an energy analyst with consultancy Purvin &amp; Gertz in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-12T17:10:17Z", "title": "Oil prices dip in face of faltering global economy", "tags": ["Business", "Oil", "Global recession", "Recession", "US economy", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "Oil prices fell by nearly two and a half dollars to reach $38.40 today amid rising gloom about future demand due to the faltering state of the global economy.

The nation&apos;s unemployment rate jumped to 7.2%, the highest since 1993. &quot;It seems that demand worries continue to dominate market psychology and not even the tensions in the Middle East, OPEC production cuts or the gas row between Russia and Ukraine were able to pull up prices,&quot; said Vienna&apos;s JBC Energy in a research note.

The application deadline for students applying to university in 2009 closed today, and admissions officers hope this year&apos;s figures will see the positive trend continuing. Applications for Oxford and Cambridge, and for medicine and dentistry courses, in 2009 had to be completed in October, and they showed a 6.5% increase. The Royal Society of Chemistry said it was pleased to see the number of chemistry undergraduates rise above 4,000 for the first time in over a decade to 4,009 in 2008.

Some wore leather shoes, others battered trainers. One man wore scuba diving boots made from wetsuit material. Much of the lycra on show began life hugging torsos on other continents.  There were, however, some constants among the 40 or so Kenyans lined up at the bottom of a valley in the distance-running capital of the world - a lack of helmets, pure glucose powder as the energy booster of choice, furrowed brows when gazing at the course ahead: 15.5 miles, gaining 1,500 metres in altitude. And, of course, the bicycles: big, solid, Indian or Chinese-made roadsters with no gears and names like Phoenix and Five Star. &quot;My bicycle is so heavy, about 15 kilogrammes,&quot; said Samuel Wanjala, who rode nearly 100 miles just to get to the race in Iten, western Kenya. A proper racing bike would help if he were to &quot;meet with Lance Armstrong ... and put him aside&quot;.  He was joking but that is exactly what the organiser of the race, Nicholas Leong, hopes will happen in the next few years. A 40-year-old commercial photographer from Singapore, Leong has already invested nearly three years and tens of thousands of pounds of his own money in his quest to prove Kenyans can transfer their running success into the almost exclusively white world of professional cycling.  &quot;In 106 years of the Tour de France there has never been a single black rider,&quot; said Leong, at the start line in Iten last weekend. &quot;I am trying to help change that.&quot; The search for a &quot;black Lance Armstrong&quot; in a country with precious little cycling history might at first seem outlandish - but Leong is deadly serious about his African Cyclist project.  He took two Kenyan amateur riders from the town of Eldoret, 20 miles from Iten, to tackle the famous Tour de France climb at Alpe d&apos;Huez in August last year. Zakayo Nderi, a 26-year-old shoe-shiner who had never ridden a racing bike with gears before leaving Kenya to train for the ride, made it in 42 minutes 10 seconds, then the fastest time of the year and an achievement that would have placed him in the top half of Tour riders when a time trial was last held on the mountain in 2004. Publicity about the feat helped to secure sponsorship from a French hedge fund manager, enabling Leong this week to open a full-time training camp for up to 10 riders near Eldoret, along the lines of numerous high-altitude running camps in the area. Negotiations are starting on hiring a professional trainer from abroad.  Last Sunday&apos;s race, the first in a series to be held every two months, was designed to identify new riders to join Leong&apos;s team. The participants are promised a monthly salary of more than \u00a3200 - excellent money in these parts.  The start line had been chalked across the road, and there were no water points despite the heat. Repair kits were rare; one man taped a screwdriver behind his seat while the rider who discovered before the race that his rear tyre was flat simply accepted his ride would be very tough. &quot;This is like the earliest days of cycling in Europe,&quot; said Leong, before climbing aboard a pickup serving as the lead car. &quot;The bikes, the people, the spirit!&quot; Though he never cycled competitively, Leong has followed the Tour on television since his childhood. In other sports he watched black players became ever more common during the 1980s and 90s. But the Tour has remained resolutely white, a fact that Leong says is solely down to lack of opportunity.  He wrote to a dozen professional cycling teams urging them to seek out African talent. Only one replied, with a &quot;sympathetic no&quot;. So Leong decided to test his theory himself.  He avoided seeking professional advice. &quot;People would have thought I was a kook,&quot; he said. But had he done so he might have been discouraged.  Tim Noakes, a renowned professor of sports science and exercise, at the University of Cape Town, said that while marathon runners and cyclists often shared outward physical characteristics, the processes involved in running and cycling were completely different. But Leong persevered. After six months of searching for a promising rider to support he stumbled across Nderi, from the Kikuyu tribe, who had run competitively at school but enjoyed riding more. Samwel Mwangi, 24 and also Kikuyu, who packed supermarket shelves and rode a &quot;boda-boda&quot; bicycle taxi, soon joined Leong&apos;s team, along with a third rider, Sammy Ekiru, a Turkana. When news got around town that they had been put on contracts, people&apos;s attitudes to cycling began to change.  &quot;Before when we used to train for fun people would say &apos;Have you not got work to do?&apos;,&quot; Nderi said. &quot;Now people see they can earn money from this and want to be cyclists too.&quot;  Leong&apos;s three riders took the podium positions in Sunday&apos;s race, but not before a complete unknown had threatened a grand upset. Ishmael Chelanga, 23, the man who wore diving boots, finished a close fourth. His bicycle cost him about \u00a330. He said he was a boda-boda operator in Eldoret, and had only been cycling for leisure for five months. What&apos;s more, he was a Kalenjin who had run competitively at school.  Though Leong could barely contain his excitement, he did not give a contract to Chelanga, whose \u00a380 prize was more than he earns most months. To be sure Chelanga was serious about cycling, he asked him to come back for the next race. &quot;I&apos;ll be stronger,&quot; said Chelanga. Then he rode home. Can they do it? Dan Hunt, coach to Rebecca Romero, Olympic gold medallist in cycling and silver medallist in rowing: &quot;Off the back of what Rebecca Romero has done there has been a lot of talk about talent transfer, but the athletes you are looking for need a very specific set of skills and physiological qualities. The more complex the task, the harder it is to transfer from another sport because the skills and learning required are simply too much. The Kenyans are physically very gifted but I&apos;m not sure which box they would fit into in cycling. There are question marks over how they might adapt. Men&apos;s road cycling has a massive pool of talent worldwide and you need more than just a big engine and a strong pair of legs. Trying to teach an 18- to 25-year-old runner the tactical ins and outs of road racing would be difficult, the bike handling would be a question mark, and the repeated ebb and flow of pace in a road race might be hard to handle. It&apos;s not like an endurance run.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/15/london-2012-olympic-games-seb-coe-boris-johnson", "sentences": ["It is the halfway point between the electrifying moment in July 2005 when Jacques Rogge opened that envelope in Singapore, and the scheduled lighting of the Olympic flame in Stratford in front of 80,000 spectators."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-16T00:05:14Z", "title": "Olympic Games: Halfway to the opening ceremony, London 2012's progress report", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics & the media", "Boris Johnson", "London politics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Amid a sea of contrived staging posts on the way to London 2012, today&apos;s milestone is an exception.

In those three and a half years the London 2012 budget has more than doubled, from \u00a33.4bn to \u00a39.3bn, thanks largely to inflation, increased security costs, the addition of VAT and a contingency fund that will almost certainly all be spent.

In 1,287 days, the eyes of the world will be on London as we light the Olympic flame and deliver a truly memorable Games which the whole country can feel part of and be proud of. We have lots of hard work ahead but we will be ready and we won&apos;t disappoint.&quot; Despite the effects of the economic slump, which has hit private investment and could impact on subcontractors, London 2012 is on time and on (revised) budget. But big questions remain. Will the vision that won London the Games \u2013 a lasting legacy for sport at elite and participatory levels and a new start for a deprived patch of east London, so eloquently envisaged by Coe \u2013 be the very things lost to expediency? And will verve and imagination be sacrificed to austerity? Here, the Guardian looks at the progress to date against the promises made in 2005 and examines the potential pitfalls ahead. The venues In 2005, Coe told the International Olympic Committee that London&apos;s strategy for the venues could be summed up as &quot;parks and passion&quot;. The candidate file said London 2012 would be a &quot;compact Games in the heart of the city&quot; with &quot;venues in historic locations and parks&quot;. The stadiums would be filled with &quot;knowledgeable, passionate spectators&quot;. Part of that vision is taking shape. In a post-industrial wasteland, the bowl of the 80,000 seat Olympic Stadium is complete, revealing the curves of the running track where medals will be won and lost. The project is currently three months ahead of schedule and its design \u2013 with 25,000 permanent seats topped by 55,000 temporary \u2013 has won plaudits for its deliverability. That is not bad after the Wembley saga, when the new national stadium came in late and vastly over budget. Still to be resolved is the design of &quot;the wrap&quot; \u2013 a kilometre-long and 30-metre high plastic cladding that will cover the temporary scaffold and become the visual icon of the Games. It is, critics say, a cheap solution which risks looking tatty by contrast with the architectural drama of Beijing&apos;s Bird&apos;s Nest stadium. In truth, Olympic bosses had little choice. The estimated stadium budget is almost \u00a3500m; the 2004 estimate was \u00a3280m. The Aquatics Centre&apos;s progress has been less simple. It was designed by the avant garde architect Zaha Hadid and its original \u00a373m budget was not realistic. The design jury placed architectural flair above deliverability \u2013 particularly regarding the wavy roof, which has provided an engineering headache. It is on course to cost at least \u00a3300m, but with little other inspiring design planned for the park, it is hoped some of the Centre&apos;s glamour rubs off elsewhere. Progress has been slower than on the main stadium, but work started last summer, two months earlier than planned. As with the main stadium, there is no certainty about what use will be found for the pools after the Games, with local authorities concerned at the cost of maintaining an Olympic pool when local recreational pools are needed more. It is the responsibility of the mayor, currently Boris Johnson, to find a solution. The Velodrome will be the last major venue to be built, although the 4m-deep bowl for the track is visible and major construction will start this spring. A final decision on whether to move the shooting from Woolwich is due shortly. The village Accommodating 17,000 athletes and officials, &quot;ideally within the Olympic Park&quot;, has proved the biggest headache to date. The organisers had hoped to use private finance to fund almost all of the \u00a31bn required. That was swept away by the credit crunch, as the developer Lend Lease found it impossible to raise the money. The collapse in house prices in the area made the deal even less attractive because suddenly it was uncertain how much the athletes&apos; apartments would sell for when they were released on to the general market after the Games. Coe had promised &quot;spacious&quot; accommodation, but a decision to cut the number of apartments, in order to cut costs, means that more competitors will have to be squeezed into each unit. The cost of the project mirrors exactly the size of a contingency fund held by the government in the event that extreme circumstances should befall the Olympic project. The government has released \u00a395m to keep ground works going while a deal is thrashed out. Whether it will be forced to release the rest depends on whether the private sector can finance the development on terms which are not punitive to the public purse. The option of complete nationalisation has not been ruled out. A decision is due in March. The park On their return from Beijing, Coe&apos;s team stressed how London would have a very different &quot;look and feel&quot;. Monumental architecture and plazas the size of military parade grounds would not deliver the intimate spectator experience London proposed, they said. So enjoying a landscaped park with grassy hills and mature trees will be as much a part of attending the Games as being inside one of the arenas. Henman Hill at Wimbledon and the fan zones pioneered during the 2006 World Cup in Germany have been cited as examples of how to create a festival atmosphere. Media centre Budgeted at \u00a3134m, the cost of the mammoth International Media and Broadcast Centre, which will house 20,000 journalists and broadcasters, has spiralled to nearer \u00a3400m. Private-sector investment has dried up completely and the Olympic Delivery Authority&apos;s chief executive, David Higgins, has admitted the cost will have to be met entirely by the government for at least the next year. Various cost-cutting measures have been considered, including making the venue a temporary one or splitting it in two. The prospect of dropping the original vision, of a lasting creative-industries hub that could house 13,000 employees, has worried local politicians and community groups. An announcement is expected by March. Sponsorship Paul Deighton, Locog&apos;s chief executive, pledged to raise \u00a3650m towards the overall budget of \u00a32bn from 2012-specific sponsors. The rest will come from ticket sales and the IOC&apos;s own sponsorship and television deals. Deighton and his commercial team have been hailed for their prescient decision to go to the market early, with so-called &quot;tier one&quot; sponsorship packages worth \u00a340m each. In all Locog has raised more than \u00a3450m already. But the economic slump has already led to one of those sponsors, Nortel, filing for bankruptcy protection and such conditions will leave Locog with a huge challenge to raise the final third of their target through a series of smaller deals, in cash and kind. Although Nortel yesterday said it remained committed to the Games, it served as a timely reminder that nothing can be taken for granted in these turbulent economic times. Transport Since London got the nod transport has been the area most often highlighted as the most likely achilles heel. Under plans announced at the end of last year, around a quarter of a London-wide network of designated Olympic routes would have lanes especially reserved for vehicles carrying athletes and officials. Spectators will be encouraged to travel on public transport. A key promise was to deliver a &quot;compact&quot; Games but with each decision over whether to relocate sports to save money, that concept is challenged and new transport headaches are introduced. The legacy It was the key bid word that went a long way to clinching it for London, but many of those involved may now wish they had not hitched their wagons to such an opaque concept. And with Locog and the ODA concentrating on delivery, some fear the focus on the event&apos;s lasting impact has been diluted. The success or failure of various &quot;legacy&quot; promises will be key to how the Games are judged by history. Mayor Johnson will unveil his legacy vision in March. As far as the Olympic Park goes, the &quot;Flatpack Games&quot; have promised to leave no white elephants and a winning legacy for sport and the East End. But there have already been casualties. For example, the leisure pool that was promised alongside the Aquatics Centre will not be built. And with some final decisions still to be made, there will be fewer permanent venues and more temporary ones. Furthermore, critical voices have been raised in the Olympic boroughs about the likely impact of changes to the plans for the Media Centre and other buildings. Following detailed talks with Saracens and Leyton Orient, it appears unlikely that the main stadium will find a rugby or football club to move in, due to the commitment to an athletics track and the cost of converting it. Johnson is now in talks with various universities, from London and overseas. In terms of the Games&apos; sporting legacy, success in Beijing raised hopes that UK Sport&apos;s performance-focused investment policy was bearing fruit and made the target of fourth in the medal table in London look achievable, despite a \u00a350m shortfall in funding. More muddied are the various pledges to increase participation and inspire a generation of young people to take up sport. There are concerns that there is not enough joined-up decision-making between Sport England&apos;s aims, those of the departments of health and education and the Olympic organisers. Coe promised that the London Olympics would inspire a generation. For all the focus on diggers and land decontamination, it is on such words that the 2012 Games will be judged."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/jan/16/michael-white-china", "sentences": ["Their grandchildren now live in Singapore, Perth, Sydney and London (among them my daughter-in-law) as well as Sarawak."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-16T08:46:02Z", "title": "What will the new China make of the Pacific Rim's efforts to reintegrate?", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "China", "New Zealand", "Australia news", "US news", "Politics", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "In the former gold-mining settlement of Arrowtown in New Zealand the other day I stumbled on the remains of the Chinese quarter down by the river. Mostly rough stone huts, a single room, primitive fireplace and no window, they were set in the woods on the edge of the town. Out of sight then, but excavated and respectfully preserved nowadays. That is a crucial part of the story. Who were these miners, the 100-strong community who had come so far across dangerous seas in search of a fortune in the then-remote mountains above Queenstown, now the South Island&apos;s premier all-season resort? For the most part young peasants escaping economic hardship and political turmoil in Guangdong province \u2013 European colonialists called it Canton \u2013 just north of Hong Kong. As geographical mobility was enhanced at the end of the 19th century by steam ships, trains, the telegraph and \u2013 most of all \u2013 by newly discovered lands and opportunities \u2013 ambitious or hungry young men (sometimes women and children too) were on the move all over the world. Then, as now, some planned to make enough money to go home and live in comfort, though relatively few actually did. Then, as now, they sent money back to families, moved into other trades and settled, or got sick and died. Then, as now, people from their own neighbourhood joined them in the process known as &quot;chain migration&quot;. The United States was the biggest magnet for European migrants who had no plans or desire to go home, though Latin America, the cooler parts of Africa and Australasia also attracted incomers. We know about them, just as we know about the Indians who went to east Africa to trade, to Fiji or \u2013 VS Naipaul territory \u2013 the West Indies who became indentured labourers and stayed. In a reverse migration after the second world war, people from the former European empires came to Europe too \u2013 though their sights were not set as high as those 19th-century Chinese gold miners, who spread all over the Pacific \u2013 Australia and California too \u2013 in search of that precious yellow metal. We know less about what China calls its Overseas Chinese here in Britain because they barely impacted upon our own story in the way that people from the Indian subcontinent did. Chinese restaurants alongside Indian ones in every small town are one thing, factory hands and doctors in big cities quite another. The Chinese had been trading and migrating among their Pacific neighbours for centuries, but the double blow of the 19th century \u2013 the steady internal collapse of the Qing/Manchu dynasty and the external imperial incursions of Europe, the US and fast-modernising Japan \u2013 gave new incentives to leave, sometimes under duress, and not just to find gold either. In Sarawak, Malaysia, last month I met an elegant 95-year-old widow who crossed the perilous South China sea \u2013 from Fujian province opposite Taiwan island to Borneo \u2013 in a junk when she was 20, to marry a peasant to whom she had been betrothed at 10. Like their migrant counterparts in America they prospered \u2013 growing rubber, pepper, a sideline in soya sauce \u2013 and educated their children. Their grandchildren now live in Singapore, Perth, Sydney and London (among them my daughter-in-law) as well as Sarawak. The result is that all around the Pacific Rim established states, where such people now work in Silicon Valley or Brisbane real estate, are trying to create a coherent narrative that does not marginalise the Chinese dimension \u2013 or squeeze it into stone huts down by the river. In parallel there is a huge effort under way to embrace the role of the &quot;original inhabitants&quot; or &quot;indigenous Australians&quot; (Aboriginal as a noun is frowned upon), and the Maoris in New Zealand. Likewise the Inuit and Native Americans in Canada and the US, and their counterparts in Latin America, where &quot;native&quot; leaders are now getting elected president, their equivalent of the US&apos;s Obama moment. You can see the process in the museums and art galleries of Australia and NZ, where indigenous art \u2013 the pointillist aboriginal paintings, those highly distinctive Maori carvings \u2013 is given equal billing with that of European origin. In Wellington&apos;s striking, postmodern Te Papa national museum this week I noted that the curators have sought to compare European and Maori creation myths, just as they now give pride of place to beautiful (though once dismissed as patronising) paintings of elaborately tattooed Maoris, as earnestly recorded by Victorian painters. Likewise due weight is given to rival migration stories, the 50,000 year isolation of Australia&apos;s inhabitants (and its wildlife) from Asia by the deep, dangerous Torres Strait, the Maori arrival in New Zealand \u2013 &quot;land of the long white cloud&quot; \u2013 west across the vast Pacific circa AD800-1300. And so on. Te Papa currently has an exhibition on the Kiwis&apos; Scottish inheritance, though the Poles get a mention too. Which is where the restored Chinese quarter at Arrowtown fits in. Hard-working and respectable, the Chinese miners were initially welcomed, but when times got tougher the usual &quot;yellow peril&quot; prejudices kicked in. Migration policies which were still in place until the 1970s and 80s kept Asian migrants out of Australia and New Zealand. As a young student from Hunan, Mao Zedong protested against anti-Chinese US immigration policy. They discriminate no longer. So the narrative has had to change and has been marked, in the modern fashion, by historic apologies for past wrongs and inclusive archaeology such as the informative display boards at Arrowtown. After all, Asian tourism is also crucial to the Kiwi economy. Chinese tourists were there the wet morning we visited. In New Zealand, where the Maori warrior tradition gave European colonists serious trouble, bilingualism in public places and documents is now routine, just as correct pronunciation is now given to many Maori place names, all part of the Maori revival. The Maori party is getting unprecedented consultation in the new conservative coalition in the Wellington parliament. As elsewhere, myriad tensions, historic, economic, political, remain to be resolved \u2013 or not. Despite the marketisation of the Kiwi economy \u2013 David Lange&apos;s Labour government started the process 25 years ago \u2013 and growing evidence of conspicuous wealth, New Zealand remains a comfortably social democratic society, less dynamic but also less brash or polarised than Australia. You never see beggars here, or slums, as you routinely do in the United States. In some ways it is easier for the Chinese, whose civilisation is immensely old, its historic achievements widely understood. Visiting Seattle&apos;s city museum 20 years ago \u2013 just as the Chinese global re-emergence was beginning \u2013 I was struck by its Pacific orientation; little of the European high art of New York or Washington, but dazzling displays of Chinese painting and pottery of 1,000 years ago and more. Quite what the new China makes of the Pacific Rim&apos;s efforts to reintegrate its culture remains to be seen. Human nature being what it is, for every Beijing official gratified by such museums another may prefer to remember the opium wars and other humiliations of the 19th century. Who burned down the imperial summer palace? Why, we did. Let us hope they decide to forgive us, for Balmoral&apos;s sake if nothing else. It is one of the new century&apos;s big questions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/jan/16/mendes-cherry-orchard-bridge-project", "sentences": ["Singapore, New Zealand, Spain, Germany, and Greece will host this season&apos;s foreign exchange productions of The Winter&apos;s Tale and The Cherry Orchard."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-16T11:46:36Z", "title": "Alexis Soloski: Mendes's Cherry Orchard gives a view of the Bridge", "tags": ["Broadway", "Theatre", "Stage", "Sam Mendes", "Culture"], "article": "When I was last in London I read a very amusing programme essay by my fellow American Matt Wolf, about the differences between British and US theatre. You applaud politely; we leap to our feet in raptures. You spend the interval sipping cocktails; we queue for the bathroom. And someone should really speak to Broadway theatres about their senseless refusal to stock Maltesers. Sam Mendes, Kevin Spacey, and Joseph Melillo, the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), have apparently decided that these warring theatrical traditions should attempt a rapprochement. They&apos;ve devised the Bridge Project, an acting company that marries British, Irish and American actors. (They&apos;ve also extended an invitation to lone Canadian Richard Easton. Perhaps he serves as interpreter.) As Sam Mendes said, &quot;The Bridge Project was born out of a simple desire: a wish for artists, collaborators, and audiences on both sides of the Atlantic to experience one another&apos;s work, talent, and artistry in the theatre.&quot; The Bridge Project will run for at least three seasons, staging two plays in repertory first in Brooklyn at BAM, then in London at the Old Vic, then the world over. Singapore, New Zealand, Spain, Germany, and Greece will host this season&apos;s foreign exchange productions of The Winter&apos;s Tale and The Cherry Orchard. While London critics will sometimes worry over a dependence on US plays, we New York ones occasionally fret about English actors. Are they so much better than our homegrown ones? Is it more than just those plummy vowels? The Bridge Project does not pit British plays against American ones, but it does provide the opportunity to appraise each nation&apos;s histrionic strengths. Though the Bridge Project&apos;s Cherry Orchard (as translated by Tom Stoppard) made its debut in Brooklyn, a recent performance revealed that the American actors don&apos;t appear to benefit from their home advantage. The clash of accents wasn&apos;t as bothersome as some had feared, but Sin\u00e9ad Cusack and Simon Russell Beale seemed to absorb Stoppard&apos;s language and Chekhov&apos;s characters easily, while the Yanks strained for the same effect. (Ethan Hawke seems to have strained himself hoarse.) And though British director Sam Mendes champions the collaborative spirit, perhaps he&apos;s having a bit of a joke on the former colonies. In a play that concerns itself with class and social order, the Americans content themselves in the roles of minor clerks and servants, while their counterparts from across the water play Chekhov&apos;s bourgeoisie. Apparently this won&apos;t alter in The Winter&apos;s Tale when Cusack, Beale, Rebecca Hall et al play the sophisticated Sicilians, while Hawke and Josh Hamilton appear as the bucolic Bohemians. Now really, Mr Mendes, didn&apos;t we fight some dreary war to avoid just this sort of treatment?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/17/family-first-person-matt-frei-washington", "sentences": ["Lottie saw first light in a teaching hospital in Singapore, surrounded by 20 visiting medical students from mainland China, Thailand and the Philippines.", "Since then, as well as the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, I have lived in Israel, Germany (again) and Rome.", "We also loved living in Singapore, but as a foreigner they gave me a mandatory Aids test lest I contaminate a state where chewing gum is still an offence."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-17T00:01:00Z", "title": "First person: BBC reporter Matt Frei on his family's nomadic lifestyle", "tags": ["Family"], "article": "We live on a quiet cul-de-sac in the Cleveland Park district of Washington DC. On a clear day, when the wind blows our way, we can hear the bells of the Washington national cathedral peal in the distance, which makes us think of England. The houses are overshadowed by giant poplar trees, and the architectural styles range from &quot;colonial&quot; (ie 1950s) to &quot;federal&quot; (ie 1960s). The Monday before last, the quiet of Tilden Street was interrupted by the arrival of black armoured SUVs with tinted windows, secret service sharpshooters and burly men with wires protruding from their ears, nervously surveying our neighbourhood for potential menaces. This spectacle will repeat itself five times a week during term time for the next four or eight years depending on the whim of the American electorate. The Obama children are going to Sidwell Friends, the Quaker school at the end of our road. Amelia, my nine-year-old daughter, wants to switch schools so that she can get sleepovers at the White House with 10-year-old Malia Obama. The arrival of the Obamas is just another reminder of the transient nature of the city we have called home for the last six years. Every time an administration changes, Washington undergoes a massive, tribal shift. In the freezing days of early January, Republicans have been leaving in droves, licking their wounds. It is the periodic transience of power, and Washington seems once again like a clearing house of warring tribes, and my children are already feeling its impact. At Alice and Amelia&apos;s American school, the change in administration means that some classmates leave and new ones arrive. At George and Lottie&apos;s British school, meanwhile, the flux is constant. The children of diplomats, World Bank or IMF officials come and go like passing fads. George has lost his four best friends in the past two years. One is in Nigeria, another in Pakistan and two have returned to the UK. He has become very good at making new friends, but one of his first questions is: &quot;How long are you staying?&quot; He can hardly blame his friends for their geographical promiscuity. Just 11, he has moved continents and country three times already. George was born in Hong Kong just after the last British colony was handed back to China. Amelia followed a year and a half later in the same fog-clad hospital on Victoria Peak, just before a devastating typhoon was due to hit. Lottie saw first light in a teaching hospital in Singapore, surrounded by 20 visiting medical students from mainland China, Thailand and the Philippines. Alice started life in the sedate surroundings of Sibley hospital in Washington DC. Whether we like it or not, Alice has to have an American passport because she was born on American soil. The bad news is that she also has to have a social security number and will forever be woven into the wide and adhesive net of the US Internal Revenue Service. The good news is that she can run for president one day. Their mother, Penny, is English and grew up within earshot of her extended family in London. Their father is German, the son of refugees who left Silesia before it became Poland and settled in West Germany. Like my children, I had an early taste of the nomadic lifestyle. I was 10 when my family left our home in a small village in the Black Forest and moved to London, where my father became a correspondent for German radio in 1972. Since then, as well as the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, I have lived in Israel, Germany (again) and Rome. So our four children are benignly confused. &quot;Where do we actually belong?&quot; is a question often asked in our household. &quot;Heathrow airport,&quot; one of the children once quipped. As they get older, the question becomes more difficult and more important to answer. My son supports Chelsea but has never seen Chelsea play at home. He wears the shirts, the hats and even the blue slippers, but he doesn&apos;t burn with the same visceral passion as a homegrown supporter. When the Queen made a state visit to America in 2007, his class from the British school formed a human pyramid of smiles and curtsies for the visiting royals and their presidential hosts. George shook hands with that other George (Bush) and with the Queen, but he was also heard asking who that &quot;other man&quot; was. Prince Philip smirked, the teacher gave him a ticking off, I was quietly proud.  Amelia deals with her multicultural upbringing in true chameleon fashion. She became so bored with being asked at her American school to pronounce the word &quot;loo&quot; or &quot;water&quot; that she just started to sound like her audience. With her American friends, she slips effortlessly into a perfect Washington twang. She puts her hand on her heart when she sings The Star-Spangled Banner. At home or among her British friends she sounds completely English. It is uncanny and a little freaky, but the division is sacred and Amelia insists on two birthday parties: one for her American friends and one for the others. She wants to blend in. Lottie, seven, and Alice, five, still move effortlessly and unselfconsciously between different worlds. Although I have noticed that Alice speaks to her imaginary friends - she has about four - in increasingly American accents. She is clearly living her version of the American dream. We have been enormously lucky to live our nomadic existence. When George complains about the peripatetic lifestyle, I remind him that he rode an elephant in Java when he was three. In an age when our children can travel the world with the click of a mouse, how wonderful to have been there, done that. I firmly believe that the happiest nomads are those who know where they are heading and when. Diplomats move around far more than foreign correspondents. There is a brutal clockwork to their travels: three years in a posting, then three years in London, followed by another posting. No extensions, few exceptions. It is ruthless but predictable. The itinerary of a foreign correspondent is more woolly and indulgent, but also more difficult to explain to children. Ultimately, it all comes down to mum and dad&apos;s whim. There is something escapist about expat life. You are a permanent outsider - free to admire and complain, to bicker and to analyse, but also free to get up and go. I felt a twinge of envy and admiration as I watched my American friends vote in the last election. We own our house in Washington. We have lived there for more than six years. It is the only place that most of our children remember living in. America is much kinder to Brits and other foreigners than we are to them. I was once let off a speeding fine in Louisiana by a cop who told me that he &quot;loooved Brits, that we were their only friends in the war on terror and that he had a real soft spot for our prime minister, Johnny Major&quot;. That was in 2003. Yet when we land at Dulles, a giant 1970s oyster of an airport, we are brusquely reminded of our status as non-resident aliens. &quot;Actually, I do reside here, I pay American taxes, I own a small slice of your vast country and I am most definitely a creature of this planet,&quot; I once replied to a gruff Homeland Security official. His sense of humour was off duty. We also loved living in Singapore, but as a foreigner they gave me a mandatory Aids test lest I contaminate a state where chewing gum is still an offence. Because of the combined demands of ageing parents and growing children, our next move will probably be back to the UK. Despite the miserable weather, the exorbitant petrol and the cramped housing, there is a lot to be said for returning to become a resident non-alien and planting one&apos;s toothbrush in a place called home. The father of the two young African-American girls going to the school at the end of our road is a good example. A son of Kansas and Kenya, Barack Obama was brought up in Hawaii and Indonesia. He understands the world, but he belongs in America. \u2022 Only in America by Matt Frei is published by Harper Perennial at \u00a38.99.

But what I can say with a degree of certainty is that whereas once the fish tank, which held a couple of naked tungsten bulbs directly over water, had the dubious accolade of most lethal domestic appliance, now, although safer and more sophisticated, it should have the soubriquet of domestic gas guzzler. Typically, it runs a close second to the family fridge in terms of continuous power consumption.  Keeping an aquarium (unfiltered goldfish bowls are a complete no-no as they breed disease and are cruel) filtered, heated and lit is not optional, so the first thing to recognise is that energy use is constant. The second thing to realise is that so are the fish - a goldfish, for example, can grow to 12in and live to 25 years.  Fish-keeping is one of the planet&apos;s most popular hobbies and Europe is the biggest market for ornamental fish. Ninety per cent of fish are freshwater (this is preferable), but the demand for more brightly coloured species from tropical waters continues to increase, as does the unfortunate hobby of establishing mini-reef ecosystems in aquariums. Increasingly, collectors hellbent on finding Nemo use toxic substances, such as sodium cyanide, to remove fish from tropical waters. Meanwhile, the high mortality rate of wild captured fish (up to 80% for some species) as they are moved between exporting warehouses and transportation docks in re-oxygenated bags, is hardly surprising, but it serves to up the environmental ante - collectors are pillaging the ocean&apos;s most sensitive habitats to fulfil orders.  You can avoid this by stocking your aquarium with native, temperate-climate freshwater fish (this way the tank also needs less energy) or at least farmed freshwater ornamental fish which now come from the Czech Republic, Spain or Holland, rather than traditional hubs such as Singapore and Japan, which also cuts down emissions a little.  Will wild fish in aquaria ever be sustainable? Marine conservation organisation, Reef Check (reefcheck.org), is working with marine-collecting co-operatives in an effort to establish a sustainable model. One day there might be a traceability standard or label, but for now you need to call on reputable sellers of aquarium species for advice - contact ilfordaquarists.co.uk (thought to be the UK&apos;s oldest active fishkeeping club) or practicalfishkeeping.co.uk.  Is it cruel to keep fish?

In April, RBS raised \u00a312bn in a rights issue, the largest in history. In the October bank bail-out, the government bought \u00a315bn of ordinary shares and \u00a35bn of preference shares. Those preference shares will now convert to ordinary shares taking the taxpayer&apos;s stake from 58% to 68%.

The bank&apos;s total impairment charges against bad debts was $10.1bn, up 58%, while its investment bank took $3.9bn of credit crunch write-downs.

In December it issued a shock profits warning, admitting it would have to take another provision of \u00a38bn in bad debts. HBOS had announced a \u00a34bn rights issue in April and in the October bail-out, the government invested \u00a38.5bn in ordinary HBOS shares and \u00a33bn in preference shares. In the same bail-out, the government agreed to buy \u00a31bn of preference shares in Lloyds and \u00a34.5bn in ordinary shares. The taxpayer now owns 43% of the combined bank.Almost the entire HBOS board left last week, ahead of the merger, although former chief executive Andy Hornby is staying on as a consultant. Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels is now running the combined group. Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius, 62 Government stake 0% October bail-out \u00a30 In April Barclays, which has eschewed government aid, raised \u00a34.5bn from Qatari investors, the China Development Bank and Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund Temasek and Japanese bank Sumitomo Mitsui. In October it needed more and raised \u00a37bn in a placing that left two Middle Eastern investors, including the Abu Dhabi sheikh who owns Manchester City football club, with more than 30% of the bank. There has not been any blood in the boardroom, although as a condition of the fundraising, directors will take no bonuses and will be up for re-election in April. Big fish The global banking and markets division behind much of the record-breaking losses at Royal Bank of Scotland was run by the urbane and popular Johnny Cameron. He left the board shortly after the bank bail-out last October but RBS admitted yesterday that the division could create repercussions for some time yet. A Scot whose late father was also on the RBS board, he joined the bank just before its historic takeover of NatWest in 2000. Cameron played a key part in the bid battle, after which his division grew rapidly - and allowed him to install a vast fish tank in his office."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/21/sailing", "sentences": ["In the Volvo Ocean Race, Kenny Read&apos;s Puma leads on the fourth leg, from Singapore to Qingdao, China, just ahead of Torben Grael&apos;s Ericsson 4 and Bouwe Bekking&apos;s Telefonica Blue."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-21T01:06:14Z", "title": "Sailing: Michel Desjoyeaux crosses equator as Samantha Davies stalls in Vend\u00e9e Globe", "tags": ["Sailing", "Sport"], "article": "Michel Desjoyeaux, whose lead in the Vend\u00e9e Globe solo race around the world was almost halved to 336 miles, when he traversed the Doldrums, has crossed the Equator with Foncia and is drawing away from Roland Jourdain on Veolia \u00adEnvironnement.

Their alleged attempt to rob the accounts of some of the world&apos;s largest companies was foiled when they bungled attempts to send money to fake accounts after sneaking into the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation&apos;s London headquarters on two occasions. Two men and a woman appeared in the dock at Snaresbrook crown court in east London accused of being part of the scheme to corrupt the Japanese bank&apos;s computer systems and electronically transfer money by the Swift banking system to accounts in Spain, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore.  Three other men have already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal.  Kevin O&apos;Donohue, 33, from Birmingham, a security supervisor in the bank, and Belgians Gilles Poelvoorde, 34, and Jan Van Osselaer, 32, will be sentenced at the end of the trial, which is expected to last at least six weeks. The jury was told that attempts by O&apos;Donohue to tamper with the bank&apos;s CCTV system did not go to plan as &quot;snippets&quot; of the trio entering the premises together had been found, along with DNA evidence on a cable O&apos;Donohue had tried to sever.  Hugh Rodley, 61, who goes by the bought title of Lord Rodley, of Tudor Manor, Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, David Nash, 47, of Durrington, West Sussex, and Swedish national Inger Malmros, 58, deny they were part of the conspiracy to defraud and transfer criminal property between 1 January and 5 October 2004.  Another man, Bernard Davies, 74, had been due to stand trial with the others but he died last weekend. Simon Farrell, QC, described the attempt as &quot;dishonest, bold and sophisticated&quot;. The hackers installed software in the bank that took snapshot images every two seconds of the keystrokes used during business hours and stored names and passwords, the court heard. Farrell said the the information was copied and uploaded over several evenings after O&apos;Donohue smuggled the men in.  The jury was told that Poeldoorde and Van Osselaer were taken back on a later date and the stolen passwords and codes were used to compile 10 Swift money transfer system messages. But the messages failed to go through because the two hackers made a key logging error.  The three men allegedly left the bank at 4.30am but returned the following afternoon and made 11 further attempts at Swift transfers but these could not be completed either. They tried to steal money from accounts belonging to some of the world&apos;s biggest companies including Toshiba International, Nomura Asset Management and Mitsui OSK Lines. Farrell said: &quot;Mistakes were made. Fairly frantic attempts were made to collect the money.&quot; The three accused &quot;must have known what was going on&quot;, said Farrell, who claimed Rodley was in control and put up the others to front the accounts. Inside the bank, O&apos;Donohue had tried to cover the gang&apos;s tracks, said Farrell, but &quot;he failed to do a perfect job&quot;.

The cause of this crisis is the deregulation and privatisation that was started under Thatcher, which has brought economic catastrophe. It must be, and is now being, reversed. But in the immediate future virtually every Londoner is going to be worse off as a result. Many will lose their jobs. An economic shock on that scale will affect every other sphere of society: sustaining good public and social services, protecting the environment, stopping racism and maintaining good community relations, as well as affecting the entire culture of the city. It also requires open and constructive discussions within a broad framework of progressive opinion to develop fresh ideas. Within this framework no one strand has all the answers. But it is possible and necessary to hammer out some of the areas where the progressive majority in London can unite around radical steps to sustain our city, support social justice and promote good community relations. This issue of how to protect London and Londoners in the context of the worst economic crisis for 80 years will push aside the kind of trivia that some commentators and politicians prefer to addressing the real issues affecting our city. On the directly economic front, four interlocking challenges have to be tackled. The first is that this crisis is registering a colossal shift in the centre of gravity of the world economy with the rise of the huge new markets of China and India. China, for example, is now the single largest source of finance in the world. Rapidly deepening London&apos;s links with China, India and other dynamic Asian economies is essential for the London economy across the board, from business services to tourism. The debate about whether London needs offices abroad can now be seen to be just out of touch with economic reality. London needs more, not less, international openness and links if its massive service sector and creative industries, which will continue to supply the great majority of jobs and incomes in the city, are to prosper. Second, it is clear that the core of Britain&apos;s banking system must, and probably will be, nationalised. Contrary to Thatcherite nonsense still coming out of the new London mayor&apos;s office, the deregulation espoused by Thatcher in large part caused the present catastrophe and offers no way out of it. The real issue is how to make the newly nationalised banks successful. That will be critical to London&apos;s success. Third, with private sector investment collapsing and the international benchmark for city infrastructure being set, and constantly raised, by the huge scales of investment in cities such as Singapore and Shanghai, we need massive investment in London&apos;s infrastructure in areas such as transport, housing and other public services. This is necessary immediately to counter the downward spiral of recession, but it is equally vital over a prolonged period to meet the competitive challenge that is now coming from Asia, to make London more competitive and to maintain and boost employment and living standards.The &quot;small government&quot; approach of the present Tory administration of London is a recipe for both short-term and long-term disaster for the city. Fourth, in a recession the living standards of low- and middle-income Londoners come under the greatest attack and have to be protected. All of the steps above assist this but more specific and short-term measures will be needed. For example, Boris Johnson pushing up fares above the rate of inflation, while cutting transport investment, is the last thing we need. Instead of throwing money away by ending the congestion charge in the richest part of London, Kensington, and scrapping plans to tax gas-guzzlers more, London government should be doing the opposite. Investment should be sustained, fares held down and money raised by charging those who choose to clog the roads and pollute the roads with gas-guzzlers or use cars in the centre of the city, where public transport is far more efficient. Housing is another key area where massive government intervention at every level is now essential. The private sector is not building homes because its profits are falling \u2013 and this will put the greatest pressure on affordable housing. But that does not mean Londoners&apos; need for homes is any less. So another programme to tackle the crisis must be massive government-led investment in building new, affordable homes. To be effective this has to include ensuring the right of local authorities to draw on all appropriate income streams to build homes. London&apos;s relationship with the emerging new world economy is intimately linked to the correct orientation of the culture and community relations of our city. London must be a centre of cultural creativity, but it can only be this to the degree that it is simultaneously open to the culture creativity of the entire world. That is the kind of open city which will produce the best music, film, art and community relations. It is the kind of city that welcomes international visitors, whether as tourists, workers or investors. And it requires taking on and defeating every form of racism, xenophobia, religious and cultural intolerance that some politicians will try to stir up to scapegoat minority communities as people face the greatest economic crisis most of us have ever seen. Anything else will destroy the community relations essential to one of the most diverse cities and in the world, and repel, rather than attract, the international connections that must be at the heart of our economic strategy. Finally, whatever the short-term economic pressures, the great priority of the environment, above all, climate change, continues. There has to be a radical shift in the burden of taxation onto the most well-off and those who produce the greatest pollution. That is a further reason why holding down fares and proceeding with a CO2 charge on gas-guzzlers, together with a return to London&apos;s radical environmental agenda, is required."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/24/popandrock-worldmusic", "sentences": ["&quot;I did a thing in Singapore with Gilles Peterson and he&apos;s the same."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-24T00:01:00Z", "title": "Lauren Cochrane meets Grammy-nominated, must-have producer Diplo", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "World music", "Music", "Culture", "Diplo"], "article": "You&apos;ve probably heard the work of Diplo even if you didn&apos;t know it. All you have to do is switch on the TV and radio or watch Pineapple Express and Slumdog Millionaire. Diplo - AKA DJ and producer Wesley Pentz - soundtracks our lives without even trying. His party sound was behind Bonde Do Role&apos;s Nokia ad-gracing Solta O Frango, MIA&apos;s Paper Planes, which soundtracks both Seth Rogen&apos;s and the Mumbai slum kids&apos; escapades (and is now up for a Grammy), and tracks by everyone from Yeah Yeah Yeahs to Kanye West. And that&apos;s before we&apos;ve mentioned gigs from Trinidad to Australia, London to South Africa you may have caught along the way. Ladies and gents: meet the king of the global remix. Pentz has been DJing ever since moving to Philadelphia as a student at the age of 15, and created a potent party brew from the start, including his now legendary Hollertronix parties in the early noughties. &quot;We played Miami bass, Baltimore club and trash 80s music. These days it sounds so cliche but it was groundbreaking,&quot; he says, comparing it to Erol Alkan&apos;s London-based dance/indie/pop mash-up, Trash. &quot;Black and white kids would be in the same room dancing to everything mixed up. That just didn&apos;t happen in Philly.&quot; The former anthropology major has taken this mix-up principle and run with it. Like a globetrotting Alan Lomax, Pentz collects party music everywhere he goes. A set might contain everything from Brazilian baile funk to Brooklyn reggae, UK grime to Angolan kuduro and dirty southern hip-hop. &quot;I get given all kinds of demos of weird music,&quot; he grins. &quot;I did a thing in Singapore with Gilles Peterson and he&apos;s the same. He represents the classic thing, and I&apos;m about the cheaper-rent sounds.&quot; See baile funk, the favela-based sound that impressed Pentz so much that he flew to Brazil after hearing one song. &quot;It was some kids screaming over a Smiths track with some breakbeat over the top,&quot; he recalls. Pentz&apos;s reach is growing due to his rising profile as a producer, and the globe-straddling gang of artists out for some of his sounds. The ex-squeeze of MIA, he first brought baile funk-influenced beats to Bucky Done Gun on her debut album Arular, and worked on the follow-up, Kala, too. Then there are remixes for stars like Gwen Stefani, Kanye West and Bloc Party. Oh, and the imminent release of Favela On Blast, a documentary on baile funk based in the Brazilian favelas that &quot;started out as a weekend project&quot; but grew with a desire to &quot;show how crazy the scene out there is&quot;. All this makes the title of his latest compilation - Decent Work For Decent Pay - seem very apt. It&apos;s a collection of his work from over the past four years by one of the hardest-working knob-twiddlers in showbusiness right now. Not that he sees himself becoming the next super-producer churning out remix after remix for five-figure fees. &quot;I want to bring up new artists, not just work with Britney and Kelis, and make sound-a-like tracks,&quot; he says. &quot;Working with major-label artists is never that fun. Me and Maya did the Paper Planes vocal out the window with a pillow as a wind guard. If it&apos;s formulaic, it&apos;s boring.&quot; Jaded producers, take note: as our Diplo For Dummies guide, below, shows there are many different ways to make that perfect track \u00b7 \u2022 Diplo&apos;s Decent Work For Decent Pay Volume One is out on Mon Diplo&apos;s guide to his best collaborations HollatronixNever Scared (2003) This was my first release. We put it out ourselves and sold about 600-700 just in clubs in downtown Philly which was pretty cool. The kids on the cover were actually from the school where I was working at the time. This track made it into the New York Times&apos; records of the year list. I thought that was as big as I could get, but now we&apos;ve been in there three times. BlaqstarrSupastarr (2007) I found Blaqstarr in Baltimore, on Unruly Records. No one around him knows how much potential he has; he&apos;s in a bit of a Baltimore bubble. I even had to pay to have Maya in the studio with him. They recently did a cover of The Wire theme song together and a track I worked on, Get Off, is out this year. He has the craziest voice, like the Isaac Hayes of our time. MIA vs DiploPiracy Funds Terrorism mixtape (2004) I was asked to work with Maya after she heard this track I did called Newsflash. I didn&apos;t know how to get that Philly sound without being in Philly so she came here for a week. We made Bucky Done Gun [on her debut album] but I was nervous. We made the mixtape because I thought it couldn&apos;t suck with other stuff around it. When Arular came out, the mixtape really lifted the record. MIAPaper Planes (2007) Me and Maya, by this point, were deep in our relationship, close to getting married. The record is about killing each other but also loving each other more than anything in the world. But, also, we were watching The Wire a lot at the time and I pinched some lines for it. Now it&apos;s become huge on the rap scene - Lil Wayne and 50 Cent have rapped on it. The Grammy thing is huge, but we&apos;ll never win. KanoReload It (2005) I played at a couple of parties at Fabric in London, bringing grime and hip-hop together. That was the sound the label wanted for Kano. I made this record in a really hip-hop way with samples. I used an old George Harrison cover made new with old sounds. I still really like it now; it didn&apos;t really do anything when it was released but people went crazy when Kano did it live. Buraka Som SistemaSound Of Kuduro (2008) Kuduro is Angolan music that I first found out about through some Angolan kids I met in Rio. Buraka Som Sistema aren&apos;t part of the scene in Africa but they were playing kuduro at parties in Portugal. I&apos;m in the process of getting their album distributed in the US. They&apos;ve become really good friends and we&apos;ve recently done a kuduro version of Lil Wayne&apos;s A Milli, called Um Milhao. Bonde Do RoleSolta O Frango (2008) No one in Brazil outside of the favelas would listen to baile funk until I played it in the Euro clubs; it&apos;s like some kind of colonial attitude where they need an outsider to play it back to them. These kids aren&apos;t actually from the baile funk scene. They&apos;re kind of like CSS - middle-class art kids. They don&apos;t represent ghetto funk. This song has made me the most money ever. Diplo &amp; SantogoldTop Ranking: A Diplo Dub (2008) She wanted to work with me but I was working with Maya at the time so I palmed her off to [collaborator] Switch. Then they made the track Creator and I didn&apos;t want to miss out. I did three tracks for her album. We decided to do a mixtape but it took forever; she&apos;s such a perfectionist. I leaked it online but you can&apos;t get it now; she got sued by some guy named Santo Gold. Yeah Yeah YeahsGold Lion remix (2006) After Piracy Funds Terrorism came out, Interscope wanted me to remix every song they released. I only did songs I liked - Le Tigre, Queens Of The Stone Age, Gwen Stefani, Yeah Yeah Yeahs. This track was the first time I used a computer; I made a whole different song. Diplo &amp; SwitchMajor Lazer (2009) Major Lazer is a guy me and Switch made up: an old army dude who is into dancehall. We&apos;re working with a lot of Jamaican artists: Collie Budz, Vybz Cartel, Mr Vegas as well as Santogold and Maya. Dancehall is great because it&apos;s so ambiguous; they might use an Irish jig or the Diwali riddim, which has Indian origins. We like that because we&apos;re good at picking weird stuff too."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/25/high-street-lenders-lending-liverpool-grant-bovey", "sentences": ["Sales offices opened in Dubai, Singapore and Ireland."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-25T00:01:00Z", "title": "Nick Mathaison: Now we're bailing out the high-street lenders", "tags": ["Credit crunch", "Liverpool", "Football", "Banks and building societies", "Business", "Money"], "article": "In retrospect, perhaps, lending TV personality Anthea Turner and her husband Grant Bovey tens of million of pounds might not have been the wisest decision ever made. Property developer Bovey and Anthea Turner, the former Blue Peter presenter and GMTV sofa girl, paid themselves handsomely on the back of running one of the country&apos;s biggest buy-to-let companies. The idea was that Bovey and Turner sprinkle interior-design magic on bundles of houses snapped up off-plan from developers at a discount, flip them on to buy-to-let investors, and charge a management fee on behalf of the new owners. Easy money in the boom years, when two-thirds of all homes built in London were sold to buy-to-let investors.  The Imagine group of companies was slated for a stockmarket float, amid talk from Bovey that revenues could reach \u00a31bn. Sales offices opened in Dubai, Singapore and Ireland. In fact, the latest accounts show revenue of just \u00a353m.  It was all made possible by HBOS, Britain&apos;s biggest property lender, which, even after the demise of Northern Rock in September 2007, pumped more than \u00a340m into Bovey&apos;s enterprises.  Last month, Bovey and Turner crashed to earth; their empire is in administration. The UK taxpayer is now exposed to the debts Bovey incurred at HBOS. Indeed, since the government controls 43% of the new Lloyds HBOS high-street giant, and more than 70% of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the taxpayer has a major stake in a large portion of Britain&apos;s debt-fuelled mania.  RBS has issued \u00a368bn of loans on commercial property in the UK and abroad, \u00a313bn on construction, and \u00a384bn on service industries which are mostly borrowed against land and real estate assets. In all, RBS&apos;s property-related lending totals \u00a3165bn. It is hard to think of a European financial institution with more to lose in the current property downturn, one which has seen values plummet 35% since July 2007. Worse, property derivative traders believe values still have another 18% to fall. The cast list of investors or businesses that HBOS and RBS gave loans to includes Liverpool football club, Scots businessman Sir Tom Hunter, a Russian oligarch reputed to be the 11th richest man in Britain, and a host of property developers and housebuilders at best precariously placed, and at worst heading for the rocks. Liverpool&apos;s is among outstanding loans now owed to taxpayers. RBS underwrote a \u00a3350m refinancing arrangement to the Premier League giant&apos;s warring co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett, who have six months to raise the funds for repayment. Gillett also has to refinance a \u00a340m loan secured as a personal guarantee in the refinancing package. Failure to secure new finance could be awkward for the Americans. Liverpool&apos;s delicate financial position means the re-emergence of negotiations with Kuwaiti billionaire Nasser Al-Kharafi, who pulled a \u00a3600m offer to buy the club last year, has assumed vital importance. Meanwhile, a cause for concern in Whitehall is how ABN Amro, the Dutch bank owned by RBS, seemingly lent \u00a32.5bn to Leonid Blavatnik, a billionaire Russian oligarch. The loan, used to bail out a chemical business owned by Blavatnik, was reportedly written off, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.  Among other RBS investments showing acute signs of distress is Aim-listed housebuilder Oakdene. In a statement to the stock market last Wednesday, Oakdene said it had requested a suspension of trading in its shares, pending &quot;clarification of its financial position&quot; after failing to reach an agreement with banks. Oakdene would be the first listed housebuilder to fail in the current property slump. It is believed that the biggest lender to Oakdene is RBS. If Oakdene&apos;s lenders are willing to pull the plug, it will worry top property and housebuilding executives. Among them will be Sir Tom Hunter, former retailer and serial investor. One respected financier, asked to nominate his worst example of reckless lending, cited the deal that enabled HBOS and Hunter to buy housebuilder Crest Nicholson. While the sale valued Crest at \u00a3700m, the deal saw the pair arrange a \u00a31.12bn debt facility to refinance the company and provide it with working capital. The move was completed in March 2007. Four months later, the credit markets closed. Crest now faces a potential debt-for-equity swap, as the value of its land banks plummets. Hunter is one of HBOS&apos;s most prominent customers.  It was HBOS that backed Hunter and a number of other investors, including Richard Desmond and the low-profile Reuben brothers, in buying retirement business McCarthy &amp; Stone for more than \u00a31bn. A recent attempt by the Reuben brothers to buy out the other shareholders failed and concern remains about whether the business can sustain its huge debt burden. Having spent \u00a31bn clearing 190 acres of windswept, contaminated land at Greenwich, south London near where the O2 arena now sits, the taxpayer potentially faces more losses from planned regeneration of the area. This is because HBOS is a 14% shareholder and lender to Quintain, the property company that has development rights to build 10,000 homes on the Greenwich peninsula. In 2007, HBOS offered to buy Quintain for \u00a31bn. The bid was rebuffed by the firm&apos;s management. Today Quintain is worth around \u00a330m. In some ways, HBOS had a lucky escape, though it still has loans outstanding to Quintain and has seen the value of its shares fall by more than 95%. How long it will take HBOS to realise a profit is anybody&apos;s guess. Other high-profile assets in which the UK now has a stake include those owned by fallen property investment vehicle Dawnay Day, which went into administration last summer. Included in its huge portfolio is the Wolseley restaurant on London&apos;s Piccadilly, which is currently up for sale. Insurance firm Norwich Union, which last week stopped retail investors from taking their money out of one of its property funds, has the lion&apos;s share of debt owed by Dawnay Day. But Anglo Irish Bank and HBOS also have loans outstanding. In the murky world of debt markets, companies&apos; borrowings are traded between banks. The debt markets provide a true indication of a company&apos;s worth. If the market does not think a debt can be repaid, the loan will be traded at less than its original value. Among businesses with hundreds of millions of pounds worth of debt trading at a huge discount are private equity-owned companies such as German satellite outfit ProSiebenSat, the building company Lafarge, and chemicals business Ineos. Distressed debt is symptomatic of the leverage boom that has brought the British economy to its knees. It is inevitable that HBOS and RBS own a large slice of this worthless paper. And their problem is now our problem. Deep pockets: the bankers who went too far Sir Fred Goodwin To many, the archetypal high-street banker, right down to his tie, with its emblem of the organisation he lived for - Royal Bank of Scotland.  At 41, Goodwin was relatively young when he became chief executive in 2000 after the takeover of National Westminster. More recently, RBS has been at the centre of the collapse of the British banking system; it was criticised last week by the prime minister who was angry it had not behaved more prudently, though he did not mention Goodwin by name.  The bank is forecast to notch up a 2008 loss of \u00a328bn, the highest in UK corporate history.  But the man nicknamed &quot;Fred the Shred&quot; for his cost-cutting zeal was intent on turning RBS into a global giant and made over 30 acquisitions including, fatefully, ABN Amro, which he bought at the top of the market. According to a former colleague: &quot;Many executives were scared of him. He ran the place with an iron fist, set out what was wanted, and expected people to deliver.&quot;  Prior to the banking crisis, Goodwin was said to have a good rapport with Gordon Brown - both went to Scottish grammar schools - and was knighted when Tony Blair was prime minister in 2004. He is chairman of the Prince&apos;s Trust, and former colleagues say he is a firm believer that businessmen have a duty to help the underprivileged. He resigned in October after being forced to ask shareholders to bolster the balance sheet to the tune of \u00a312bn, but left with a pension pot worth \u00a38.4m. Andy Hornby Used to be known as the &quot;boy wonder&quot; of British banking and was paid several million to prevent him jumping ship to a rival organisation in the run-up to his appointment as HBOS chief executive.  Hornby was 38 when he took over from James Crosby in 2006, when the company could boast that its shares were performing better than most other banks listed on the London stock market. But HBOS has been one of the most prominent casualties of the financial crisis and has been forced to surrender to a rescue takeover by Lloyds which was completed a few weeks ago.  Like Goodwin, Hornby, 41, has hardly covered himself in glory and unions are furious, fearing the closure of hundreds of branches and the loss of thousands of jobs. Educated at Oxford and Harvard, where he was top of his class of 800, Hornby was poached from Asda by Crosby in 1999 before Halifax merged with Bank of Scotland. He quickly made his mark, launching Halifax&apos;s infamous attacks on the &quot;big four&quot; and unleashing Howard, the singing bank manager, on the nation. Peter Cummings Cummings was the banker who liked to say yes to the British commercial property industry. The quietly spoken Glaswegian, who last year earned \u00a32.6m, more than chief executive Andy Hornby, was until two weeks ago in charge of a loan book worth \u00a3109bn.  Cummings became one of the most powerful deal-brokers in Britain and had one of the nation&apos;s most impressive contact books, backing deals by retail tycoons Sir Philip Green, Sir Tom Hunter, Prince Al-Waleed of Saudi Arabia, the Barclay brothers and the Icelandic entrepreneurs behind Baugur, which owns large swathes of the British high street. But the 53-year-old banker retired early as part of a clearout of top management following the bank&apos;s near-collapse and rescue by Lloyds TSB. Cummings has been widely held up as one of the men who brought HBOS to its knees.  Though he is entitled to walk away with a year&apos;s salary of at least \u00a3630,000, it is unclear whether he will take it, or a pension pot worth close to \u00a36m. Despite his considerable wealth, Cummings is not showy, though he has been known to talk in macho terms. Last February when it was clear to many that the property world was heading into the abyss, Cummings boasted: &quot;Some people look as though they are losing their nerve - beginning to panic, even - in today&apos;s testing real estate environment. Not us.&quot; It is unclear whether he regrets that stance now.

Now he is viewed as one of those most culpable for the crisis. He is blamed for allowing the housing bubble to develop as a result of his low interest rates and lack of regulation in mortgage lending. He backed sub-prime lending and urged homebuyers to swap fixed-rate mortgages for variable rate deals, which left borrowers unable to pay when interest rates rose. For many years, Greenspan also defended the booming derivatives business, which barely existed when he took over the Fed, but which mushroomed from $100tn in 2002 to more than $500tn five years later. Billionaires George Soros and Warren Buffett might have been extremely worried about these complex products - Soros avoided them because he didn&apos;t &quot;really understand how they work&quot; and Buffett famously described them as &quot;financial weapons of mass destruction&quot; - but Greenspan did all he could to protect the market from what he believed was unnecessary regulation. In 2003 he told the Senate banking committee: &quot;Derivatives have been an extraordinarily useful vehicle to transfer risk from those who shouldn&apos;t be taking it to those who are willing to and are capable of doing so&quot;. In recent months, however, he has admitted at least some of his long-held beliefs have turned out to be incorrect - not least that free markets would handle the risks involved, that too much regulation would damage Wall Street and that, ultimately, banks would always put the protection of their shareholders first.  He has described the current financial crisis as &quot;the type ... that comes along only once in a century&quot; and last autumn said the fact that the banks had played fast and loose with shareholders&apos; equity had left him &quot;in a state of shocked disbelief&quot;. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England     Mervyn King Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    When Mervyn King settled his feet under the desk in his Threadneedle Street office, the UK economy was motoring along just nicely: GDP was growing at 3% and inflation was just 1.3%. Chairing his first meeting of the Bank&apos;s monetary policy committee (MPC), interest rates were cut to a post-war low of 3.5%. His ambition was that monetary policy decision-making should become &quot;boring&quot;. How we would all like it to become boring now. When the crunch first took hold, the Aston Villa-supporting governor insisted it was not about to become an international crisis. In the first weeks of the crunch he refused to pump cash into the financial system and insisted that &quot;moral hazard&quot; meant that some banks should not be bailed out. The Treasury select committee has said King should have been &quot;more pro-active&quot;. King&apos;s MPC should have realised there was a housing bubble developing and taken action to damp it down and, more recently, the committee should have seen the recession coming and cut interest rates far faster than it did.  Politicians Bill Clinton, former US president     Bill Clinton Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP    Clinton shares at least some of the blame for the current financial chaos. He beefed up the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act to force mortgage lenders to relax their rules to allow more socially disadvantaged borrowers to qualify for home loans.  In 1999 Clinton repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, which ensured a complete separation between commercial banks, which accept deposits, and investment banks, which invest and take risks. The move prompted the era of the superbank and primed the sub-prime pump. The year before the repeal sub-prime loans were just 5% of all mortgage lending. By the time the credit crunch blew up it was approaching 30%. Gordon Brown, prime minister     Gordon Brown Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    The British prime minister seems to have been completely dazzled by the movers and shakers in the Square Mile, putting the City&apos;s interests ahead of other parts of the economy, such as manufacturers. He backed &quot;light touch&quot; regulation and a low-tax regime for the thousands of non-domiciled foreign bankers working in London and for the private equity business. George W Bush, former US president     George W Bush Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images    Clinton might have started the sub-prime ball rolling, but the Bush administration certainly did little to put the brakes on the vast amount of mortgage cash being lent to &quot;Ninja&quot; (No income, no job applicants) borrowers who could not afford them. Neither did he rein back Wall Street with regulation (although the government did pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the wake of the Enron scandal). Senator Phil Gramm     Phil Gramm Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters    Former US senator from Texas, free market advocate with a PhD in economics who fought long and hard for financial deregulation. His work, encouraged by Clinton&apos;s administration, allowed the explosive growth of derivatives, including credit swaps.  In 2001, he told a Senate debate: &quot;Some people look at sub-prime lending and see evil. I look at sub-prime lending and I see the American dream in action.&quot; According to the New York Times, federal records show that from 1989 to 2002 he was the top recipient of campaign contributions from commercial banks and in the top five for donations from Wall Street. At an April 2000 Senate hearing after a visit to New York, he said: &quot;When I am on Wall Street and I realise that that&apos;s the very nerve centre of American capitalism and I realise what capitalism has done for the working people of America, to me that&apos;s a holy place.&quot; He eventually left Capitol Hill to work for UBS as an investment banker.

Kathleen Corbet, former CEO, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s     Kathleen Corbet Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP    The credit-rating agencies were widely attacked for failing to warn of the risks posed by mortgage-backed securities. Kathleen Corbet ran the largest of the big three agencies, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, and quit in August 2007, amid a hail of criticism. The agencies have been accused of acting as cheerleaders, assigning the top AAA rating to collateralised debt obligations, the often incomprehensible mortgage-backed securities that turned toxic. The industry argues it did its best with the information available. Corbet said her decision to leave the agency had been &quot;long planned&quot; and denied that she had been put under any pressure to quit. She kept a relatively low profile and had been hired to run S&amp;P in 2004 from the investment firm Alliance Capital Management.  Investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general among others have focused on whether the agencies are compromised by earning fees from the banks that issue the debt they rate. The reputation of the industry was savaged by a blistering report by the SEC that contained dozens of internal emails that suggested they had betrayed investors&apos; trust. &quot;Let&apos;s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters,&quot; one unnamed S&amp;P analyst wrote. In another, an S&amp;P employee wrote:  &quot;It could be structured by cows and we would rate it.&quot; &quot;Hank&quot; Greenberg, AIG insurance group     Hank Greenberg Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters    Now aged 83, Hank - AKA Maurice - was the boss of AIG. He built the business into the world&apos;s biggest insurer. AIG had a vast business in credit default swaps and therefore a huge exposure to a residential mortgage crisis. When AIG&apos;s own credit-rating was cut, it faced a liquidity crisis and needed an $85bn (\u00a347bn then) bail out from the US government to avoid collapse and avert the crisis its collapse would have caused. It later needed many more billions from the US treasury and the Fed, but that did not stop senior AIG executives taking themselves off for a few lavish trips, including a $444,000 golf and spa retreat in California and an $86,000 hunting expedition to England. &quot;Have you heard of anything more outrageous?&quot; said Elijah Cummings, a Democratic congressman from Maryland. &quot;They were getting their manicures, their facials, pedicures, massages while the American people were footing the bill.&quot; Andy Hornby, former HBOS boss     Andy Hornby Photograph: Getty Images    So highly respected, so admired and so clever - top of his 800-strong class at Harvard - but it was his strategy, adopted from the Bank of Scotland when it merged with Halifax, that got HBOS in the trouble it is now. Who would have thought that the mighty Halifax could be brought to its knees and teeter on the verge of nationalisation?

The losses will reflect vast lending to businesses that cannot repay and write-downs on acquisitions masterminded by Goodwin stretching back years. Steve Crawshaw, former B&amp;B boss     Steven Crawshaw Photograph: Reuters    Once upon a time Bradford &amp; Bingley was a rather boring building society, which used two men in bowler hats to signify their sensible and trustworthy approach. In 2004 the affable Crawshaw took over. He closed down B&amp;B businesses, cut staff numbers by half and turned the B&amp;B into a specialist in buy-to-let loans and self-certified mortgages - also called &quot;liar loans&quot; because applicants did not have to prove a regular income. The business broke down when the wholesale money market collapsed and B&amp;B&apos;s borrowers fell quickly into debt. Crawshaw denied a rights issue was on its way weeks before he asked shareholders for \u00a3300m. Eventually, B&amp;B had to be nationalised. Crawshaw, however, had left the bridge a few weeks earlier as a result of heart problems. He has a \u00a31.8m pension pot. Adam Applegarth, former Northern Rock boss     Adam Applegarth Photograph: Rex Features    Applegarth had such big ambitions. But the business model just collapsed when the credit crunch hit. Luckily for Applegarth, he walked away with a wheelbarrow of cash to ease the pain of his failure, and spent the summer playing cricket. Dick Fuld, Lehman Brothers chief executive     Richard Fuld Photograph: Kevin Wolf/AP    The credit crunch had been rumbling on for more than a year but Lehman Brothers&apos; collapse in September was to have a catastrophic impact on confidence. Richard Fuld, chief executive, later told Congress he was bewildered the US government had not saved the bank when it had helped secure Bear Stearns and the insurer AIG. He also blamed short-sellers. Bitter workers at Lehman pointed the finger at Fuld. A former bond trader known as &quot;the Gorilla&quot;, Fuld had been with Lehman for decades and steered it through tough times. But just before the bank went bust he had failed to secure a deal to sell a large stake to the Korea Development Bank and most likely prevent its collapse. Fuld encouraged risk-taking and Lehman was still investing heavily in property at the top of the market. Facing a grilling on Capitol Hill, he was asked whether it was fair that he earned $500m over eight years. He demurred; the figure, he said, was closer to $300m. Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin     Ralph Cioffi Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images    Cioffi (pictured) and Tannin were Bear Stearns bankers recently indicted for fraud over the collapse of two hedge funds last year, which was one of the triggers of the credit crunch. They are accused of lying to investors about the amount of money they were putting into sub-prime, and of quietly withdrawing their own funds when times got tough. Lewis Ranieri     Lewis Ranieri Photograph: Chris Vultaggio/AP    The &quot;godfather&quot; of mortgage finance, who pioneered mortgage-backed bonds in the 1980s and immortalised in Liar&apos;s Poker. Famous for saying that &quot;mortgages are math&quot;, Ranieri created collateralised pools of mortgages. In 2004 Business Week ranked him alongside names such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs as one of the greatest innovators of the past 75 years. Ranieri did warn in 2006 of the risks from the breakneck growth of mortgage securitisation. Nevertheless, his Texas-based Franklin Bank Corp went bust in November due to the credit crunch. Joseph Cassano, AIG Financial Products     Joseph Cassano Photograph: Public Domain    Cassano ran the AIG team that sold credit default swaps in London, and in effect bankrupted the world&apos;s biggest insurance company, forcing the US government to stump up billions in aid. Cassano, who lives in a townhouse near Harrods in Knightsbridge, earned 30 cents for every dollar of profit his financial products generated - or about \u00a3280m. He was fired after the division lost $11bn, but stayed on as a $1m-a-month consultant. &quot;It seems he single-handedly brought AIG to its knees,&quot; said John Sarbanes, a Democratic congressman. Chuck Prince, former Citi boss     Chuck Prince Photograph: Diane Bondareff/AP    A lawyer by training, Prince had built Citi into the biggest bank in the world, with a sprawling structure that covered investment banking, high-street banking and wealthy management for the richest clients. When profits went into reverse in 2007, he insisted it was just a hiccup, but he was forced out after multibillion-dollar losses on sub-prime business started to surface. He received about $140m to ease his pain. Angelo Mozilo, Countrywide Financial     Angelo Mozilo Photograph: Ric Francis/AP    Known as &quot;the orange one&quot; for his luminous tan, Mozilo was the chairman and chief executive of the biggest American sub-prime mortgage lender, which was saved from bankruptcy by Bank of America. BoA recently paid billions to settle investigations by various attorney generals for Countrywide&apos;s mis-selling of risky loans to thousands who could not afford them. The company ran a &quot;VIP programme&quot; that provided loans on favourable terms to influential figures including Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate banking committee, the heads of the federal-backed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and former assistant secretary of state Richard Holbrooke. Stan O&apos;Neal, former boss of Merrill Lynch     Stan O'Neal Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images    O&apos;Neal became one of the highest-profile casualties of the credit crunch when he lost the confidence of the bank&apos;s board in late 2007. When he was appointed to the top job four years earlier, O&apos;Neal, the first African-American to run a Wall Street firm, had pledged to shed the bank&apos;s conservative image. Shortly before he quit, the bank admitted to nearly $8bn of exposure to bad debts, as bets in the property and credit markets turned sour. Merrill was forced into the arms of Bank of America less than a year later.  Jimmy Cayne, former Bear Stearns boss     Jimmy Cayne Photograph: AP    The chairman of the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns famously continued to play in a bridge tournament in Detroit even as the firm fell into crisis. Confidence in the bank evaporated after the collapse of two of its hedge funds and massive write-downs from losses related to the home loans industry. It was bought for a knock down price by JP Morgan Chase in March. Cayne sold his stake in the firm after the JP Morgan bid emerged, making $60m. Such was the anger directed towards Cayne that the US media reported that he had been forced to hire a bodyguard. A one-time scrap-iron salesman, Cayne joined Bear Stearns in 1969 and became one of the firm&apos;s top brokers, taking over as chief executive in 1993. Others Christopher Dodd, chairman, Senate banking committee (Democrat)     Christopher Dodd Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    Consistently resisted efforts to tighten regulation on the mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He pushed to broaden their role to dodgier mortgages in an effort to help home ownership for the poor.

Geir Haarde, Icelandic prime minister     Geir Haarde Photograph: Arni Torfason/AP    He announced on Friday that he would step down and call an early election in May, after violent anti-government protests fuelled by his handling of the financial crisis. Last October Iceland&apos;s three biggest commercial banks collapsed under billions of dollars of debts. The country was forced to borrow $2.1bn from the International Monetary Fund and take loans from several European countries. Announcing his resignation, Haarde said he had throat cancer. The American publicThere&apos;s no escaping the fact: politicians might have teed up the financial system and failed to police it properly and Wall Street&apos;s greedy bankers might have got carried away with the riches they could generate, but if millions of Americans had just realised they were borrowing more than they could repay then we would not be in this mess. The British public got just as carried away. We are the credit junkies of Europe and many of our problems could easily have been avoided if we had been more sensible and just said no.  John Tiner, FSA chief executive, 2003-07     John Tiner Photograph: Gary Roberts/Rex Features    No one can fault 51-year-old Tiner&apos;s timing: the financial services expert took over as the City&apos;s chief regulator in 2003, just as the bear market which followed the dotcom crash came to an end, and stepped down from the Financial Services Authority in July 2007 - just a few weeks before the credit crunch took hold. He presided over the FSA when the so-called &quot;light touch&quot; regulation was put in place. It was Tiner who agreed that banks could make up their own minds about how much capital they needed to hoard to cover their risks. And it was on his watch that Northern Rock got so carried away with the wholesale money markets and 130% mortgages. When the FSA finally got around to investigating its own part in the Rock&apos;s downfall, it was a catalogue of errors and omissions. In short, the FSA had been asleep at the wheel while Northern Rock racked up ever bigger risks.  An accountant by training, with a penchant for Porsches and proud owner of the personalised number plate T1NER, the former FSA boss has since been recruited by the financial entrepreneur Clive Cowdery to run a newly floated business that aims to buy up financial businesses laid low by the credit crunch. Tiner will be chief executive but, unusually, will not be on the board, so his pay and bonuses will not be made public. ... and six more who saw it coming  Andrew Lahde A hedge fund boss who quit the industry in October thanking &quot;stupid&quot; traders and &quot;idiots&quot; for making him rich. He made millions by betting against sub-prime. John Paulson, hedge fund bossHe has been described as the &quot;world&apos;s biggest winner&quot; from the credit crunch, earning $3.7bn (\u00a31.9bn) in 2007 by &quot;shorting&quot; the US mortgage market - betting that the housing bubble was about to burst. In an apparent response to criticism that he was profiting from misery, Paulson gave $15m to a charity aiding people fighting foreclosure. Professor Nouriel RoubiniDescribed by the New York Times as Dr Doom, the economist from New York University was warning that financial crisis was on the way in 2006, when he told economists at the IMF that the US would face a once-in-a-lifetime housing bust, oil shock and a deep recession. He remains a pessimist. He predicted last week that losses in the US financial system could hit $3.6tn before the credit crunch ends - which, he said, means the entire US banking system is in effect bankrupt. After last year&apos;s bail-outs and nationalisations, he famously described George Bush, Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke as &quot;a troika of Bolsheviks who turned the USA into the United Socialist State Republic of America&quot;. Warren Buffett, billionaire investorDubbed the Sage of Omaha, Buffett had long warned about the dangers of dodgy derivatives that no one understood and said often that Wall Street&apos;s finest were grossly overpaid. In his annual letter to shareholders in 2003, he compared complex derivative contracts to hell: &quot;Easy to enter and almost impossible to exit.&quot; On an optimistic note, Buffett wrote in October that he had begun buying shares on the US stockmarket again, suggesting the worst of the credit crunch might be over. Now is a great time to &quot;buy a slice of America&apos;s future at a marked-down price&quot;, he said. George Soros, speculatorThe billionaire financier, philanthropist and backer of the Democrats told an audience in Singapore in January 2006 that stockmarkets were at their peak, and that the US and global economies should brace themselves for a recession and a possible &quot;hard landing&quot;. He also warned of &quot;a gigantic real estate bubble&quot; inflated by reckless lenders, encouraging homeowners to remortgage and offering interest-only deals. Earlier this year Soros described a 25-year &quot;super bubble&quot; that is bursting, blaming unfathomable financial instruments, deregulation and globalisation. He has since characterised the financial crisis as the worst since the Great Depression.

As part of the discussions, players who do not have a central contract with England have been given until 8 May to return to their counties \u2013 effectively giving them a month&apos;s exposure to the IPL. Players such as the Nottinghamshire all-rounder Samit Patel, who is in England&apos;s one-day squad but is not a centrally contracted player, could benefit from that alongside Ravi Bopara, James Foster and Graham Napier of Essex. This year&apos;s IPL auction for players will take place in Goa on 6 February, while franchises have until 4 February to submit players as additions to that list."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/29/last-nights-tv-lucy-mangan-television", "sentences": ["Dolan hastily drops the curtain back into place and moves on to Singapore, peering in at eight-year-old Ainan Celeste Cawley."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-29T00:01:00Z", "title": "Lucy Mangan on last night's TV: Grand designs", "tags": ["Culture", "Television", "Television industry", "Media", "Homes TV", "Television & radio"], "article": "I have a hatred so deep for Grand Designs (Channel 4) that I told my editor that, in all fairness, I should recuse myself from today&apos;s television writing rota. &quot;Why do you hate it so much?&quot; she asked, bemused. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; I said helplessly. &quot;If I knew, I would work to remove this bile that threatens to consume me whenever I hear the poncy, smug theme tune.&quot; &quot;How can music be smug?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know!&quot; I cried again. &quot;But it is! And then it&apos;s full of people spending billions making fugly, fugly houses out of Perspex and string, and dancing around having mini-orgasms when Kevin McCloud says they&apos;ve really created unity and flow and that Perspex and string totally work together even though he thought it should be Pyrex and twine. I spend my time yelling, &apos;You people should be killed!&apos; at the screen. It&apos;s not fair on any of us. Find someone else.&quot; She told me to make a full disclosure, take two Xanax and then get on with it.  Last night, Grand Designs returned for a new series. Kevin has some new, architecturally designed sideburns, at the sight of which I popped another pill, and in this first episode they were pointed in the direction of Dean and Sarah. This being a BCC (Before Credit Crunch) programme, Dean told us how he wanted to spend some of the squazillions he made in the City on restoring a folly that overlooks their home-town of Newport and wrapping a modern building, complete with the glass-walled corridor made mandatory under the Why? Why? What Are You Doing? I Don&apos;t Understand. Why? Why? Act 1991, around it.  However. Maybe it&apos;s the tablets talking, but Dean and Sarah were less violently objectionable than most GD couples. This was perhaps also because we only really saw one of them - Sarah - and she is a ruddy marvel. She ditches their contractor and keeps the architect at bay - foolhardy moves for most, as McCloud notes in his usual lofty manner, but not for her. She just manages the project into submission. By January, the last ceiling boss has been repaired, the last giant window has gone in and she has torn McCloud&apos;s throat out for ever questioning the colour of her render. No, not quite. But she should have.  To me - and I think we can all agree that my hatred of Grand Designs, like most hatreds, stems mainly from ignorance, so I know that I must be wrong here - the end result looked like two Portakabins stacked against the folly with an aircraft lounge running the length of the garden, but to those in the know it was both &quot;reverential and a statement ... First class.&quot; I wish to know what the safe dosage of Xanax is per hour, and I will try again next week. Mark Dolan returned to present another series of documentaries that provide just enough pretence of sociological interest to let us stare at freaks unmolested by conscience or other tiresomely finer feelings.  In The World&apos;s Cleverest Child and Me (Channel 4), the first sideshow curtain he drew back revealed Adora Svitak, a literary child genius from Seattle who calls herself a &quot;writer, poet and humanitarian&quot;; wrote her first book three years ago, aged seven; and has now branched out into online and classroom teaching and pitches for corporate sessions at Microsoft. She is, against all the odds, quite a charming child, but what will happen to her when she grows up and no longer has the &quot;child genius&quot; selling point? The question is posed but not answered by Dolan, who must fly off to Malaysia to meet a mathematically gifted nine-year-old who has been turned into a brand by the adults around him and now markets brain food (different coloured bottles for the left and right hemispheres) that, he says carefully as if recalling lines from a script, came to him in a dream. He speaks softly and looks worried. Dolan hastily drops the curtain back into place and moves on to Singapore, peering in at eight-year-old Ainan Celeste Cawley. Ainan sits, mute and uncomfortable, as Dolan introduces himself, until Dolan shows him the Rubik&apos;s Cube he has brought him as a gift. Ainan&apos;s face lights up. &quot;A permutation toy!&quot; &quot;His definition is actually much more interesting than your brand name,&quot; Ainan&apos;s English expat father Valentine, a pulsating mix of fervour and neediness, points out. It comes as no surprise to learn, as he takes his son to university chemistry classes, or coaches him to memorise pi, that Valentine was a former child prodigy himself. Fortunately, Ainan has a mother who states firmly that she is &quot;not so hot on the academic front. There are other things - emotional, physical, character-building - that are important to a kid,&quot; as they watch him play on the beach. And if he occasionally stops to trace equations in the sand, she leaves him be. As the curtain swings back, we sigh with relief. \u2022 The episode of Grand Designs reviewed in Last Night&apos;s TV on 29 January was not the one that aired on January 28.

Meanwhile, the number of UK-based students has virtually stalled with the latest figures published today showing a 1% fall to 1,964,315 overall. The figures, released today by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), give details of student enrolments and qualifications obtained at universities in the UK during the 2007-08 academic year. The majority of degrees obtained by overseas students were at postgraduate level \u2013 81,480. But large numbers were also awarded first degrees \u2013 52,705. They accounted for 20% of all students awarded university qualifications in Britain in 2007-08. Over the same period, the number of undergraduate and postgraduate students from all other EU countries rose by 6% (from 105,410 to 112,150) and by 4% from the rest of the world (from 220,575 to 229,640). Universities have been warned that the market for international students will become even more competitive, despite the weak pound making the cost of UK degrees more attractive. There is also the concern that students will obtain their qualification and not put the knowledge and skills they have acquired to use in the UK. But the government&apos;s points-based visa system does now allow for international students to stay on and work in the country for two years after they graduate. In total, there were 2,306,105 higher education enrolments in 2007, showing no percentage change from the previous year. Of these, 1,480,385 were full-time students \u2013 up 2% on 2006-07 \u2013 while the number of part-time enrolments fell by 3%. A slightly higher number of full-time students took science subjects \u2013 44% of enrolments in 2007, up 1% on the previous year, compared with 35% of part-time students (down 3% on 2006). In the 2007-08 academic year, 334,890 students graduated with first degrees compared with 319,260 in 2006 (up 5%). Fears over degree inflation will be allayed by Hesa&apos;s new figures, which show 13% of first degrees taken were awarded first-class honours and 48% a 2:1 \u2013 exactly the same as in 2006-07. Some 208,120 students obtained postgraduate-level qualifications in 2007 \u2013 13% were postgraduate certificates of education, while 9% were research degrees and 77% were taught degrees. Diana Warwick, chief executive of umbrella organisation Universities UK, said: &quot;It is a mark of the quality of our system that we attract international students. It is a privilege and a responsibility that we take seriously for the UK to be able to educate people from overseas. We hope many will be &apos;friends of the UK&apos; in the future. &quot;Indeed, the UK is not alone in recognising the great benefit the international market can offer, and many countries including Germany, France, Singapore and China are all investing in strategies to attract and retain international students \u2013 China has over 100,000 international students already.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/29/thomas-campbell-met-museum-new-york-director", "sentences": ["&quot;I could get hung up about it; but honestly I feel very comfortable having been given this wonderful role.&quot; He was born in Singapore and grew up in Cambridge."], "publicationDate": "2009-01-29T19:36:56Z", "title": "Thomas Campbell, new director of New York's Metropolitan Museum, in 'go mode'", "tags": ["Museums", "Art and design", "US news", "World news", "New York"], "article": "On any scale, the task of Thomas Campbell as director of New York&apos;s Metropolitan Museum is daunting.

Most people set goals at the start of the new year, and I&apos;m no different. This year my focus is on the new Dextro Energy Triathlon ITU World Championship Series - seven races in iconic cities, including Singapore, Madrid, Washington, Kitzb\u00fchel , Hamburg, London and Yokahama \u2013 leading to a grand final on the Gold Coast in September. Sponsors have been found. Greater TV coverage is promised \u2013 indeed every race will be shown in high definition. And the money isn&apos;t too shabby either. The prize purse for each race is $150,000, with the grand final even greater at $250,000. The purse for the overall ranking at the end of the season, meanwhile, is $700,000. If I can finish as high as sixth in the overall rankings again \u2013 as I did in 2008 \u2013 I won&apos;t be doing too badly! But 2009 will be tough. In the past I have aimed to peak around the world championships, with other races, such as the Europeans and the Mazda London triathlon, as secondary goals. But this year I will have to be in great shape for a more prolonged period, from May through to September. For the super series, only four races (plus the grand final) count towards your final ranking, so at most there is five races that you have to be properly peaked for. It will certainly be a new challenge to aim to be on top form for such a long period, and it will be impossible to be at 100% peak for all the races, but the new challenge will be to be as close to this peak for the requisite races. As to how I&apos;m going to achieve this \u2013 well, you should ask Glenn Cook (my coach)! Although my schedule won&apos;t be busy, I am excited at the prospect of racing in the Mazda London Triathlon again in 2009. The last time I did it, in 2006, I came third, but in 2007 I was injured and in 2008 I was in Korea for the pre-Olympic training camp. Here&apos;s hoping for third time lucky! Questions and answers I&apos;m often asked about I deal with injuries. To be honest, injuries are very difficult for an athlete. It&apos;s frustrating to not be able to train, and there is a lot of rehab to be endured that is far less enjoyable (and cathartic!) than proper training. It&apos;s at times like these when it&apos;s important to have interests and friends outside of the immediate triathlon circle, so you can detach from it when necessary. However, this is also the time when focus and mental toughness really come into play. It&apos;s amazing how much more difficult it is to do a 30-minute aqua jog when you are injured than two-hour run when you&apos;re not injured. Around this time of year I also get asked how I find the commitment to train 25-plus hours a week, especially when it&apos;s freezing cold and lashing with rain. First, even though horizontal rain makes riding a bit unpleasant, I would choose that over a two-hour turbo any day. I can&apos;t deal with long indoor sessions, I get way too bored! Even so, if you have all the right gear and you wear enough of the correct layers, you can keep out the cold pretty effectively. I mean come on, I&apos;m a professional athlete, if it&apos;s not hard work it&apos;s not worth it! For me it&apos;s not acceptable to miss sessions unless there is a physiological reason (or there is another bloody good reason), so there is rarely any need to worry about making sessions up \u2026 and generally making up sessions is a bad idea as it overloads your body at a later time. If a session is missed it&apos;s often best to leave it and make sure you don&apos;t miss any more sessions in future. Another question I often get is from first-timers, who ask me what&apos;s the best bit of advice for a beginner. I always say join a local triathlon club. Every athlete there will have guidance and advice of different levels, and there will be a framework of sessions (especially triathlon-specific sessions) that you can jump straight into which will be a great platform to build off. Also the social side of a club/squad gives an extra dimension to training sessions that make them a lot more enjoyable. I would also add that races like the Mazda London Triathlon and the Mazda Blenheim Triathlon are great races for beginners, as the sheer volume of competitors and the well-organised nature of the events makes them very inclusive for beginners, and both events have very useful information packs that explain everything a first-timer would need to know. As for my goals for 2009, they boil down to six words: keeping climbing the London 2012 ladder!

But the big question is whether their good intentions will be enough to prevent a pulling up of national drawbridges. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act has been hovering like a spectre over the meeting of the world&apos;s economic elite at Davos; in the 1930s, the US raised tariffs on thousands of goods, which exacerbated the Great Depression and arguably paved the way to the Second World War. It&apos;s an accepted truth that protectionism, with countries implementing measures to safeguard their own domestic businesses and workers, can turn a recession into a depression. The problem is that, from Barack Obama downwards, political leaders are confronting a global crisis, but have only national tools at their disposal to fight it. And however much they believe in free trade, they are accountable to voters at a national level, who want to see their leaders putting domestic interests first. The risk is that politicians, however well intentioned, will find it impossible not to succumb to nationalist and protectionist rhetoric.  This is not idle, chin-scratching speculation. A million French workers staged a one-day strike on &quot;Jeudi Noir&quot;; there have been demonstrations in Greece and Latvia; in the UK, wildcat strikes spread from Lincolnshire to Wales and the north-east over the arrival of foreign workers at the Lindsey oil refinery, near Grimsby. In a sinister overtone, the far-right British National Party is sounding jubilant.  The protests at the refinery are not surprising - in fact, I&apos;m slightly surprised there have not been more episodes like this before now. The benefits of globalisation went primarily to capital, not to labour; workers in the UK and other developed countries have been under pressure for some time from low-wage economies. In times of prosperity, being undercut by poorly paid overseas competition is an irritant, but one that people lived with; now reactions are more atavistic and tribal. Demonstrations over foreign labour are likely to increase. Responses from governments have been contradictory; politicians don&apos;t want to stoke protectionism, but they do want to placate their electorates. Gordon Brown warned on Friday against protectionism and a retreat from globalisation, yet it is his jingoistic talk about &quot;British jobs for British workers&quot; that strikers have embraced.  The new US treasury secretary Tim Geithner has ratcheted up tensions with the Chinese, accusing Beijing of manipulating the currency to stimulate exports, yet vice-president Joe Biden has defended a &quot;Buy America&quot; steel provision in the economic stimulus bill. French finance minister Christine Lagarde, mindful of protesters on the streets of Paris and Marseille, has called for a temporary period of protectionism to shield consumers and firms against market risks, until new global regulations can be agreed. World trade has already contracted sharply, but it is not the erection of old-style barriers against imported goods that is the main worry. The real fear is of financial protectionism, an insidious new variant. As European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet warned in Davos, the pressure on banks to hoard capital is making the recession worse by stopping the flow of funds to businesses. Government bail-outs, whether of banks or of other industries, such as car manufacturing, may also be ushering in financial protectionism by the back door; the Russians have already accused America of this, saying the fiscal stimulus is leeching liquidity away from the rest of the world. A nationalistic element has been implicit in the UK bank bail-outs, where they have been told to shrink their balance sheets and concentrate on boosting lending to British customers. Although it has not been spelled out, the implication is that they should scale back drastically on activities overseas - an impression reinforced by Brown&apos;s outburst against Sir Fred Goodwin, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief, for reckless lending to the likes of Russian tycoon Leonid Blavatnik. There are likely to be instances of banks in receipt of taxpayers&apos; money being called upon to do their patriotic duty: there is one such controversy on Teesside, after work was moved from the Haverton Hill shipyard to Singapore, putting 800 jobs at risk. Local MP Frank Cook suggested the contract collapsed because Lloyds TSB, which was bailed out with billions of pounds of public money, is unwilling to maintain backing.  Crises lead inevitably to introspection and to a concentration on putting one&apos;s own house in order; banks will inevitably focus their limited resources at home. They have been told to shrink their balance sheets and concentrate on boosting lending to British customers.  Financial protectionism cuts both ways, however, and the UK is particularly vulnerable, since we rely on overseas banks for about a third of our personal borrowing. The exit of banks from Iceland, Ireland and elsewhere is leaving a large funding gap, threatening mortgages and businesses, and putting the domestic players under even more pressure. The City could lose heavily from financial nationalism, as it has always been outward-looking, much more so than Wall Street. If Britain is suffering from this repatriation of funds, some emerging economies are feeling far greater pain. Russia, which relied heavily on foreign investment flows, has been hard hit; capital flows to developing markets overall will drop to \u00a3116bn this year, around a fifth of their level two years ago, according to the Institute for International Finance. The west has a moral responsibility not to turn its back on emerging markets, particularly those which have followed our economic prescriptions, now the climate is harsh. If we are looking to even out the global imbalances that have contributed to the credit crunch, we need financial markets to be deep, broad and open.  There is no easy answer to the threat of protectionism; the only consolation is that so far, governments are making the right kind of noises and no one has done anything really provocative. It would be a brave person who is prepared to bet on that continuing, since the temptations to put immediate self-interest over trust are both strong and persistent. What the 1930s should have taught us, though, is that it is worth prioritising the greater good, because the alternative is unthinkable."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/03/drones-isreal-british-arms", "sentences": ["Israel is a major exporter of UAVs, and the Hermes 450 has been sold to the US, Singapore and Georgia."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T12:14:19Z", "title": "Israeli drones in Gaza may have had British engines, ministers admit", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Gaza", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "UK news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "article": "MPs are calling for a full account of arms exports to Israel amid growing concerns that British military equipment was used during the bombardment of Gaza \u2013 contrary to Israeli assurances and UK export guidelines. The government was adamant UK exports were not used in drone aircraft that helped the Israeli air force target missile strikes that killed more than 1,000 people and demolished thousands of homes and other buildings and infrastructure. Now, however, ministers say they are unsure what equipment was used. Attention has been focused on two critical weapons in Israel&apos;s frontline forces: the F16 ground attack fighters and the Hermes 450 drones, which pinpoint the sites for attack. British arms control officials have admitted they are unable to say whether UK-made aircraft engines were fitted to drones. And ministers say they have been unable to ascertain whether the planes were fitted with the pilots&apos; electronic kit for launching missiles, which was controversially \u2013 but legally \u2013 sold by BAE Systems to Israel, via the US, in 2002. MPs on the joint committee currently examining arms controls have expressed their frustration at the lack of information. At a hearing, they also complained that for three months the foreign office had failed to respond to questions about UK equipment in the naval blockade of Gaza last year. A Labour member of the committee, Richard Burden, who is also chairman of the Britain-Palestine parliamentary group, told the Guardian the government should provide &quot;chapter and verse&quot; on the use of all British arms exports to Israel, including critical components for the F16s. &quot;It should be possible for the government to establish the end-use of these exports. And if they cannot do that through independent checks, then that suggests that Israel is not a reliable trading partner for arms and components,&quot; he said. He recalled that in 2002 Israel was found to have broken its written assurance that no UK equipment would be used in the occupied territories when it was disclosed that Centurion tanks had been converted by the IDF into armoured personnel carriers. Describing Israel as a &quot;country of concern&quot;, the UK says it refuses to export military goods that can be used for internal repression or external aggression. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, has twice been challenged on the issue of the engine drones in the Commons since Amnesty International and the Guardian three weeks ago pointed to evidence suggesting engines made by an Israeli-owned factory in Staffordshire had been fitted to the Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle. . Miliband told MPs who have been calling for an arms embargo the allegations were false. The engine, he said, &quot;was not being used by the IDF but had in fact been for export. I am happy to stick with that.&quot; The Israeli company that imported the engines, Elbit Systems \u2013 the owners of the British manufacturers UAV Engines Ltd (UEL) \u2013 has denied they were fitted to military drones in Israel, saying they were incorporated into aircraft for export only to third countries. But at the committee hearing Jane Carpenter, a senior official with the export control section of the business and enterprise department, said that had not been checked. Sitting with Ian Pearson, the responsible business and enterprise minister, Carpenter said: &quot;We cannot categorically confirm that we have physically checked that the engines have been incorporated. We only licensed them to Israel for onward export.&quot; She added that, had the engines stayed in Israel, &quot;that would be a contravention of the licence condition, and that would be an offence&quot;. Pearson explained what checks had been made to allow Miliband to deny the allegations. &quot;My understanding is, we have spoken to this exporter and they have confirmed what we already know from our own database: that while they export UAV engines to Israel, the engines are a particular variant which is not used in Israel but is incorporated into UAVs for onward export. So they would not have been involved in the current conflict.&quot; Pearson also said that the UK government had no clear idea whether the F16s had used the BAE Systems gunsight technology. Israel is a major exporter of UAVs, and the Hermes 450 has been sold to the US, Singapore and Georgia. Britain&apos;s sensitivity about its military relations with Israel are acute since the Hermes is also the basis for the drone being developed by Elbit and the French company Thales for the \u00a3900m Watchkeeper UAV programme for the British army. The UK version, fitted with UEL engines, is due in service next year. The Hermes programme , like all the Israeli-developed drones, is classified as a state secret; the IDF has refused to confirm or deny reports, which first surfaced during the second Lebanon war in 2006, that they were armed with missiles. The evidence accumulated by the Guardian and Amnesty from academic and specialist aerospace public sources, as well as from Elbit&apos;s website and filings to the US security and exchange commission, suggested that the IDF Hermes had used engines made in the UK. The IDF first acquired these in 1997, three years after UEL Engines was bought by Elbit&apos;s drone subsidiary, Silver Arrow. The authoritative industry journal Jane&apos;s Defence Weekly reported at the time: &quot;It is powered by a 52 hp UEL AR-80 1010 rotary engine with propeller.&quot; Despite repeated requests, government departments have been unable to say whether they know what engines are used on the IDF&apos;s drones. Oliver Sprague, Amnesty International&apos;s UK arms control programme director, said: &quot;Available evidence suggests these drones are powered by UK engines. Until someone from the UK government goes and physically inspects the drones, it&apos;s hard to see on what basis they are dismissing these serious allegations.&quot; &quot;Until a robust system of end-use monitoring is in place, the UK will forever be reliant on assurances from other countries, and from arms companies, that British-made equipment is not being used to abuse human rights.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/03/formula-one-singapore-circuit-changes", "sentences": ["Organisers of the Singapore grand prix are to introduce minor changes to the Marina Bay street circuit in order to increase potential overtaking opportunities for this year&apos;s race.", "&quot;While the circuit and the event exceeded expectations around the world, as with any brand new event, there are always things which we now know we can do better,&quot; Michael McDonough, the technical and race operations director for the Singapore event, said."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-03T12:41:12Z", "title": "Formula one: Changes planned to increase overtaking at Singapore circuit", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Organisers of the Singapore grand prix are to introduce minor changes to the Marina Bay street circuit in order to increase potential overtaking opportunities for this year&apos;s race.

In a speech outlining a series of ideas to improve the quality of teachers, Gove rejected a Liberal Democrat proposal that would focus attention on cutting class sizes. Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, told the Guardian today that reducing class sizes was a major priority to break &quot;the class-based education system in this country&quot;. Gove praised many of Clegg&apos;s ideas on education, including a plan to direct resources at disadvantaged pupils through a &quot;pupil premium&quot;, which is similar to a Tory idea. But Gove said that reducing class sizes would not automatically drive up standards. &quot;In order to reduce class sizes you inevitably need to employ more; you employ more and teaching practice doesn&apos;t necessarily rise to the same extent,&quot; he told a Tory education seminar. The shadow schools secretary cited the experience of the US state of California, which failed to improve its position as the second-worst US state for education despite directing resources to cutting class sizes. Gove said: &quot;California spent an enormous amount of money on reducing its class sizes. At the end of that process they remained 48th in America. There were some measurable improvements in some schools, but these were restricted to schools where the children were all from middle-class backgrounds, and then things settled down after a while. &quot;That is not to say that [cutting class sizes] doesn&apos;t help in all circumstances. It increases the personal contact between a brilliant teacher and children. It is manifestly the case that if you have children who have special educational needs, or are currently struggling, closer attention to their needs is manifestly a good thing. &quot;[But] ... the key thing is giving schools the freedom to allocate their resources so that strong leaders can choose smaller class sizes in these circumstances [with] a brilliant and inspiring figure, who is going to give more too.&quot; Gove outlined a twin-track approach to raise the standards of teachers: immediate measures to tackle the fear of challenging pupils teachers may experience in the classroom and a longer term plan to attract a higher grade of graduate into the teaching profession. On the immediate measures, Gove said: &quot;We would change the rules on detention to make it easier to enforce. We would change the rules on confiscating the sorts of devices \u2013 from mobile phones to iPods \u2013 which disrupt learning to remove the fear of challenge from teachers. &quot;We would give teachers better protection from vexatious complaints \u2013 including anonymity when allegations of abuse are made and a time limit to ensure these allegations are either brought to court or dropped \u2013 so that careers aren&apos;t unnecessarily blighted by students playing the system.&quot; On the longer term measures to attract high-flying graduates into the profession, Gove is looking at Singapore, where only the top 30% of graduates can become teachers, and Finland, where teaching is restricted to the top 10%. &quot;The sort of young people who compete for high status jobs here \u2013 such as fast-track entry to the civil service, bar pupillages, news traineeships with the BBC, places on the accountancy or management-consultancy milk round \u2013 compete to become teachers in these countries.&quot; Gove agreed with Clegg that the freedoms enjoyed by city academies ought to be extended to all schools. But he said that they were being curtailed by internal rows among ministers. &quot;The freedoms which existing academies have used to drive up standards are now being curtailed. Freedoms over the curriculum, over staffing, freedoms over building and IT, freedom from local authority bureaucracy and central government control, have all been restricted. &quot;Sadly, education reform has become a casualty of internal Labour politics \u2013 specifically the ongoing leadership struggle being fought within the cabinet. In the war of position between Ed Balls and James Purnell, James has positioned himself as the reformer, the heir to Blair, and Ed has positioned himself as the opposite. &quot;Ed&apos;s judgment may be right when it comes to garnering support within the Labour party&apos;s electoral college \u2013 I defer to his judgment on that subject \u2013 but I fear it&apos;s wrong for the country.

Man&apos;s PR people tell us that &quot;the proportion of tax paid to profits is lower than 30% [the UK corporation tax rate for the period], which reflects the fact that a substantial part of Man&apos;s business is in Switzerland, where tax rates are significantly lower than the UK&quot;.

It seems HMRC have had their concerns over the company. Its 2007 accounts mention a &quot;transfer pricing&quot; agreement with HMRC, although the outcome of the HMRC inquiries seems to have been profitable for the company because it recorded a &quot;tax credit&quot;, suggesting it set aside more for the tax bill than it eventually had to pay. Most British hedge funds operate betwen London and an offshore centre, usually the Caymans or one of the Channel Islands. With billions in offshore transactions and - until recently, at least - profits swashing in and out of the country, HMRC might have been expected to be focusing its energy on what William Caitlin-Brittain, in today&apos;s Guardian, calls &quot;the emblem of offshore capitalism&quot;.  Yet when I recently made a freedom of information request for how many inquiries the tax authority had conducted into hedge funds, for how much tax, I was told that HMRC simply didn&apos;t know.

But a 10-year research project into the phenomenon by mental health scientists at the Australian National University in Canberra concludes that &quot;baby brain&quot; syndrome is an urban myth. Instead of suffering a slump in mental and verbal abilities during the early stages of motherhood, women&apos;s cognitive abilities improve when they become pregnant.  Moreover, researchers claim, the improvements could be permanent. &quot;Women often report problems with memory and reasoning after they become pregnant,&quot; said the chief researcher, Professor Helen Christensen. &quot;But the latest findings from our decade-long study, the most in-depth to look at this issue, has proven that they do not.&quot; Christensen&apos;s findings contradict other studies into the issue. A 2002 study by Angela Oatridge, of Hammersmith hospital in London, reported that brain scans of pregnant women showed a 4% decline in size. Last year, two Australian researchers reported that pregnant women consistently performed worse on tests for memory and verbal skills.  However, Charlotte Judet, a freelance book editor, who lives in south London with her banker husband Michel, and their two daughters, Isobel, three, and Eve, one, supports the findings. &quot;When you have small to medium-sized children, your faculties adjust so you can deal with five unexpected, stressful things all at the same time,&quot; she said. &quot;As a mother of young children, I&apos;m required to be hypersensitive to any signs that they might be in danger. I can distinguish between 15 sorts of cry, and know the difference between a good and a bad silence.&quot; Christensen, who interviewed 2,500 women aged from 20 to 24, first in 1999 and then in 2004 and 2008, was adamant that her research is authoritative. &quot;We found that women who were pregnant during the second or third batch of interviews performed the same on tests of logic and memory as they did before, and there was no difference between the pregnant women and the controls,&quot; said Christensen, who is director of the centre for mental health research at the university in Canberra.  &quot;It really leaves the question open as to why [pregnant] women - and, often, their partners - think they have poor memories, when the best evidence we have is that they don&apos;t,&quot; she said. &quot;Perhaps women notice minor lapses in mental ability and then attribute it to being pregnant because that is the most significant thing in their mind at the time. Or sleep deprivation could mask the positive cognitive effects.&quot; Christensen believes the improvements in mothers&apos; mental abilities could be permanent. She points to continuing research by scientists at the National University of Singapore who recently reported evidence of new brain circuits growing from foetal cells that had migrated into the brains of pregnant mice. &quot;Thus one might assume that women were more likely to have better, not worse, mental ability during pregnancy compared to before, and that the improvements could be permanent.&quot;  Dr Craig Kinsley, of Richmond University in Virginia, carried out research last year that mirrors Christensen&apos;s findings. &quot;I found that having children improves a mother&apos;s lifelong mental agility and protects her brain against the neurodegenerative diseases of old age,&quot; said Kinsley, who is professor of neuroscience at the university. &quot;While a woman may experience an apparent loss of brain function while she is pregnant, this could be because parts of her brain are being remodelled in preparation for dealing with the complicated demands of child rearing,&quot; he added.  &quot;The changes that kick in then could last for the rest of their lives, bolstering cognitive abilities and protecting them against degenerative diseases.&quot; &apos;Pregnancy helped me work better&apos; Lucy Bevan, a casting director, lives with her husband, Wojciech Duczmal, a film editor, in west London with their 15-month-old son, Daniel. &quot;I was casting St Trinian&apos;s when I discovered I was pregnant.

Arriva Trains Wales said: &quot;We are hoping this [dispute] will be resolved and we are confident it will be resolved fairly shortly.&quot;Press Association Murder inquiry follows fatal London shooting Police have launched a murder inquiry after a man was shot dead in north-west London yesterday. Officers were called at around 2.30am after receiving reports of a shooting in Harlesden. The man, who is believed to be in his 20s, was found at the scene and taken to hospital where he later died. The incident is being investigated by detectives from Operation Trident which deals with gun crime in the black community. Forensics officers were still sifting through evidence at the scene of the shooting yesterday and examining several cars parked outside a nearby primary school.

Derek Bourgeois, well known in the brass and wind band world, has just finished his 44th symphony - taking him comfortably beyond the record set by Havergal Brian, and making him far more prolific than the great symphonic writers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Bourgeois wrote his first symphony 48 years ago, when he was 18. But the story of his burst of symphonic outpouring began just over six years ago, when he left Britain for what he thought would be a life of walking, travel and friends. He was 60, had by that stage written seven symphonies, and was planning on a mellow retirement in the Mallorcan sun.  Fate had other ideas. Within months of moving from London to a house near the sea on the north of the island, his wife Jean - also a musician - was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. By the time she died in November 2006, Bourgeois was two-thirds of the way through his 35th symphony. And still he goes on. He marked the end of 2008 by remarrying, and by completing his 30-minute 44th symphony (the average length of a Bourgeois symphony is 47 minutes). He is now planning the 45th: by way of tribute to Haydn&apos;s 45th, the Farewell Symphony, which ends with the players leaving the stage one by one, Bourgeois&apos;s will begin with the players arriving one at a time. Few of these recent works have been performed in orchestral form. Instead, they live in cyberspace in synthesised sound - better than reading a score, but inferior to the full richness of an orchestra. At this stage of his life, Bourgeois is reconciled to writing works that may never be fully realised.  During the 1980s and 1990s, Bourgeois was director of the National Youth Orchestra; more recently, he was director of music at St Paul&apos;s Girls&apos; School. Throughout that period, he continued to do something that some elements in the musical establishment found hard to forgive: he wrote tunes. He revelled in lush tonal harmonies. The brass players of the Black Dyke or Grimethorpe colliery bands may have warmed to the rich melodic inventions and romping humour of his compositions, but the critics were more sniffy.  There came a moment when Bourgeois stopped caring. From that time, the music poured out of him. Last year&apos;s output included three symphonies, one of them among the two or three longest symphonies ever written - 155 minutes, half an hour longer than Mahler Three. Bourgeois was still an undergraduate at Cambridge university when his first symphony was reviewed by Stanley Sadie in the Guardian. The future editor of Grove&apos;s Dictionary wrote: &quot;There is cause for encouragement when a young man of 20 can write with such evident conviction and quite considerable skill.&quot; Bourgeois took composition lessons with Herbert Howells at the Royal College of Music, where Sir Adrian Boult gave his first symphony another performance. Bourgeois then returned to his old school, Cranleigh, as a music teacher, where I was one of his students.  At the end of last year, we met up again at the house in Mallorca, which he had planned as a retirement home for himself and Jean, a violinist who played for many years with Welsh National Opera. &quot;If we&apos;d been doing all the things we&apos;d planned to do in retirement, I wouldn&apos;t have had time to write all these symphonies,&quot; he says. &quot;But there she was, she was trapped in the house, and I just sat there and wrote music every morning. The symphonies all came tumbling out. They&apos;re not all gloomy. I mean, a lot of them are actually very cheerful. I found that I could escape into that world. When Jean died, it was tremendously cathartic. I got rid of almost every bit of grief inside me all in one go.&quot; I test his knowledge of his own symphonies by throwing out numbers at random. Thirty-three? &quot;That&apos;s an interesting one, it&apos;s . . . quite meaty, and has an aggressive last movement.&quot; Twenty-seven? &quot;Twenty-seven is arch-shaped; every movement is arch-shaped. It&apos;s in five movements. There are two scherzos, one of them probably the maddest piece I&apos;ve ever written.&quot; Thirty-one? &quot;That&apos;s the most atonal of the lot. It was just before I caught up with Havergal Brian, and I thought, &apos;I&apos;m going to write a real tough nut here.&apos; There&apos;s not a note of harmony in it.&quot; Thirty-six? &quot;That&apos;s quite tuneful. It was the first one I began after Jean died, and it starts off quite firmly but very soon becomes very tuneful.&quot; It turns out that many of the numbers have a musical, or extra-musical, significance. Beethoven and Schubert stopped at nine. Bourgeois&apos;s own ninth lasts two hours: &quot;Since number nine was supposed to be a very significant number, I thought I&apos;d better make it a big one.&quot; The 39th to 41st follow the keys of Mozart&apos;s great masterpieces of the same numbers. Number 42 is titled Life, the Universe and Everything, after Douglas Adams; it begins with dinosaurs and ends with a chorus about climate change. &quot;Some of them use traditional forms; some of them are completely free-form,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve written symphonies in everything from one to 32 movements. I&apos;ve come to the conclusion that form is all about the manipulation of time, rather than shape. It&apos;s a question of how you take your listener through the time. It&apos;s perfectly possible to hear a piece of music that lasts 10 minutes and feel that you&apos;ve been short-changed. It&apos;s also possible to hear a piece which lasts three minutes and which seems interminable. I mean, it&apos;s no use listening to a Bruckner symphony if you&apos;ve got a train to catch.&quot;  He starts writing a symphony with an exact length of time in mind. &quot;I know exactly where it&apos;s going to finish. And all the way through, I&apos;m aiming at that point.&quot; Bourgeois&apos;s other compositional rule is to start his next symphony on the day he finishes the previous one. &quot;The end of No 12 and the beginning of No 13 share the same last two chords. Quite a lot of those symphonies sort of flow on from each other; some of them share thematic material outside their own.&quot;  Later that evening, he plays assorted extracts from the symphonies, which live on shelves of synthesised CDs as well as on the Sibelius composing software website. The musical language is hard to pin down. It might remind you of Walton, Britten, Bernard Herrmann, Eric Coates, Stravinsky, Ives or Bart\u00f3k. The pieces are full of rich, lush melodies, stomping marches, dazzling fugues - and quite a few jokes. &quot;Well, part of life is laughing, isn&apos;t it?&quot; shrugs Bourgeois. &quot;If a symphony is going to reflect true life, why can&apos;t you laugh with it? Or even at it?&quot; Some of the jokes are almost perversely obscure. His eighth symphony (written in 2002) began from the idea of writing a piece in honour of the nearby Mallorcan town of Arta. &quot;I thought it would be fun to write an Arta Fugue, which is no sort of joke to any nationality other than the English. The Mallorcans don&apos;t think of it as being funny at all, because it doesn&apos;t have any pun connotations. The whole symphony lasted 77 minutes.&quot; He thinks it&apos;s one of the longest fugues ever written.  Other jokes include a short jazz version (&quot;Blue Brahms&quot;) of the Passacaglia from Brahms Four; a passage in the 38th symphony that&apos;s &quot;straight out of a Tom and Jerry film&quot;; and a movement of pure cowboy music in the 41st symphony to describe the region of Spain used to film spaghetti westerns. When he is not having fun, Bourgeois will set himself challenges: the 32nd Symphony is written in 32 movements - one for every possible key, plus two for untuned percussion. He shrugs off any suggestion that you shouldn&apos;t insert jokes into symphonic forms. &quot;The thing that changed me was conducting one of Britain&apos;s best brass bands. It was like the emperor&apos;s new clothes: you couldn&apos;t bullshit them. They knew if it was any good or not, and if they thought it was rubbish they&apos;d just say so. It taught me that it&apos;s no use writing music for the few people who you think are going to critically acclaim it. What you&apos;ve got to do is get through to the people who are actually going to listen to it.&quot; Today the composers he most admires are John Adams and John Williams: &quot;There was, for a while, a huge amount of scorn poured on composers who still wrote melodies and harmonies and all the rest of it. I think audiences were put off so much that they haven&apos;t really recovered. There&apos;s still a huge mistrust of new music, even though an awful lot of it now is much more approachable. &quot;In the brass band world, I was regarded as the ultra avant garde. Blitz [a 12-minute test piece, written in 1980] was regarded by a great number of people as an absolutely heinous piece, whereas when I played it to [the composer] Robert Simpson, he said, &apos;That&apos;s a very jolly blitz.&apos; One camp thought I was too old-fashioned, the other camp thought I was far too avant garde. So eventually I just decided I would be myself, and that&apos;s that.&quot; Bourgeois, who is moving back to England with his wife Norma, recently conducted the wind band version of his 41st symphony in Singapore. &quot;It turned out that my music is very popular in the far east. I had no idea at all. I was signing autographs for two hours.  &quot;I know inside me that if some of those symphonies were played, they would bring the house down. Some of the later ones would absolutely knock people sideways.&quot; And if not? &quot;I&apos;m quite happy to sit there listening to the computer playing them, because it doesn&apos;t do a bad job. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any one of them I would feel ashamed of. I mean, I might hesitate to let people loose on No 31 before they&apos;ve heard some of the others. But I think once they&apos;d heard them, they&apos;d see the point.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/10/obituary-katharine-everett", "sentences": ["But it wasn&apos;t a rags-to-riches story: her father was a commander in the Royal Navy and, after early education in Singapore, Katharine went to Wycombe Abbey boarding school, in Buckinghamshire."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-10T00:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Katharine Everett", "tags": ["BBC", "Digital media", "Television industry", "Media"], "article": "Katharine Everett, who has died aged 56 of cancer, managed to pack a huge range of careers and achievements - from award-winning programme-maker to channel controller and new media pioneer - into her lifetime&apos;s work for the BBC. She was prominent originally as a successful producer of science programmes which managed to be scientific and beautifully and imaginatively produced, as well as popular - always a great challenge for the serious, factual programme-maker. Her two most acknowledged pieces were Oppenheimer (1980, for which the team won a Bafta) and The Iceman (1992), a Horizon on the mummified remains discovered in the Alps in 1991, which was one of the most watched science programmes of its time. She worked on Tomorrow&apos;s World and went on to produce two memorable medical series: Your Life in Their Hands and Hospital Watch, the latter one of the first real-time, observational, outside-broadcast sequences. Katharine started at the BBC in 1975 as a costume assistant in the wardrobe stockroom in Television Centre, west London. She then worked as a telephone inquiry clerk before being accepted as a research assistant trainee alongside Mark Thompson, the current director general - a fast-track route to the heart of the BBC. But it wasn&apos;t a rags-to-riches story: her father was a commander in the Royal Navy and, after early education in Singapore, Katharine went to Wycombe Abbey boarding school, in Buckinghamshire. She honed the sewing skills that got her a job at the BBC as wardrobe mistress for student productions in Oxford while reading English at Lady Margaret Hall.  Katharine brought her forensic intellect, visual sense, astonishing organisational powers and attention to detail to her life as a science producer and went on to apply many of the same skills to BBC1&apos;s finances and then in 1997 as the launch controller of programmes for BBC Choice, which is now BBC3. Despite large expectations and tiny resources, the channel launched successfully and Katharine deserved much of the credit for that. She saw the promise and challenge that digital television and interactive media would provide. Colleagues saw her as the first great public service digital pioneer. From Choice, she went on to join the newly created interactive TV department. Under her leadership, it pioneered the BBC&apos;s developments in interactive television, navigation and digital text services including the popular Wimbledon interactive service.  In 2001 she became the first controller of the whole of new media in the BBC. There she brought teams together, encouraged collaborative working and drove the corporation into greater awareness of the potential.  Katharine moved to become project director for Greg Dyke&apos;s motivational campaign Make It Happen, which involved 10,000 BBC staff in rethinking their working methods. In 2004, she became director of change and a leadership and organisational consultant within the BBC. She brought her formidable intelligence, huge efficiency and powers of persuasion to these roles and was vehement in her support of mentoring as a tool of career development and good management. She became an executive coach at the BBC and had started to build up an external practice too in the year before she died. Even at her leaving party last November, much weakened by the cancer that would kill her, she was still thinking of the best way for the corporation to operate and exhorted senior executives to support mentoring and coaching schemes as a great way of getting the best out of talented people.  Katharine&apos;s enthusiasm for the BBC, for its output and public purposes, never flagged, though she could be as impatient as its critics with mistakes and misjudgments. She was the epitome of a public service broadcaster in her desire and ability to communicate serious subjects to a mass audience and to bring information, education and entertainment to viewers using new and innovative means of communication.  Katharine is survived by her husband, the film editor and post-production firm owner Horacio Queiro, and by a son and a daughter.  \u2022 Katharine Winn Everett, television executive, born 3 July 1952; died 3 February 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/10/international-baccalaureate-moved-amsterdam", "sentences": ["The others are Washington and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-10T15:36:58Z", "title": "Leap from Cardiff to Amsterdam for International Baccalaureate", "tags": ["International students", "14 - 19 education", "Schools", "Education", "UK news"], "article": "The company behind the International Baccalaureate diploma \u2013 one of the main rivals to A-levels \u2013 is moving its headquarters out of the UK because it says staff here are not &quot;internationally-minded&quot;. The move is a blow for UK education. Almost 100,000 students take the IB diploma across the world every year, 3,315 of whom are from the UK. And 681,000 students worldwide take other IB courses. Around 300 employees are expected to lose their jobs in Cardiff when the headquarters is moved to Amsterdam. The company has experienced unprecedented growth over the last few years. The number of programmes IB offers has grown by 10% each year for more than 20 years. The 330 employees at the IB&apos;s main office, in Cardiff, take much of the credit for this and were furious to be told yesterday that the headquarters will move from the Welsh capital to Amsterdam by 2020. Bosses have told staff \u2013 many of whom are experts in assessment and curricula \u2013 that they are &quot;isolated&quot; in Cardiff and lack an international mindset. Monique Seefried, chair of the IB&apos;s board of governors, came from the US to speak to employees in Cardiff in September. She told them leaders of the company found that &quot;you in Cardiff remain very isolated from the needs of schools and of the cultures that the IB aspires to serve&quot;. The &quot;organisational structure&quot; in Cardiff did not fit with the &quot;ethos of international-mindedness that we insist upon&quot;, she said. Jeffrey Beard, the IB&apos;s director-general, told Cardiff staff in a presentation in May that the Welsh capital was remote, making it &quot;difficult to attract qualified staff&quot;, and was tricky for air travel. The company is offering staff the chance to relocate, but few are thought to be keen to do so. Cardiff has been the headquarters of the company for 20 years. In a letter to the company&apos;s board of governors, staff wrote: &quot;It may prove impossible to maintain the high standard and reputation of the IB when such a drastic and unnecessary step is taken. It is simply too risky to put the future of the IB at stake.&quot; Another said: &quot;The anger and desperation of staff in Cardiff are not simply a matter of self-interest. &quot;Many of us have given years of service to the IB, enabling it to grow to its present size. We do not want to see this work and commitment squandered. The proposed move from Cardiff to a more expensive location, where recruitment will be more difficult and more costly, is potentially disastrous for the organisation.&quot; A spokeswoman from the IB said parts of the assessment operation associated with the marking of thousands of exam scripts twice a year would be kept in Cardiff indefinitely. Beard said: &quot;We are implementing some hard choices that have resulted from our studies, but will do so with respect and gratitude to those who have got us this far, whom we very much value. It is with a sense of purpose and excitement that we are taking the organisation to the next stage of its development, expanding its possibilities and with it the possibilities of children all over the world.&quot; The IB diploma is now regarded as more academically challenging and broader than taking three or four A-levels. The university admissions service counts the top IB score as equivalent to six A grade A-levels. Overseas, the diploma can be taught in French, Spanish and English. Government ministers have lauded the qualification and in 2006 provided \u00a32.5m so that every local authority in England could have at least one centre offering sixth-formers the chance to do the IB. The Amsterdam base will be one of three global centres for the IB by 2020.

A minority of Middle East pundits have recently emerged as advocates for a one-state solution, which would undermine Israel&apos;s legitimacy and internationally recognised right to exist as a sovereign Jewish state in the land of my forefathers. Having personally witnessed the remarkable progress we have made with the Palestinian Authority in recent years, I believe that a two-state solution is not only the best resolution to this age-old conflict, but one within our reach. The one-state solution has enough intrinsic flaws to render it no solution at all. From Israel&apos;s perspective, it is not possible for the Jewish people to accept an arrangement that signifies the end of the existence of a Jewish state. From the Palestinians&apos; perspective, they should not be denied the opportunity to take their national destiny into their own hands. Dissenters from the two-state solution contend \u2013 not without some reason \u2013 that Gaza and the West Bank are too small to absorb the Palestinian refugees. Yet this would also be the case under the one-state formula; it would result in a state that is merely 24,000 square km and that already overflows with a population exceeding 10 million (5.5 million Jews and 4.5 million Arabs). While cynics might question the size of the West Bank and Gaza, optimists should look no further than Singapore for reassurance. The area of the West Bank and Gaza is nine times as large as Singapore&apos;s, yet the combined population of Palestinians in both regions is smaller than that of Singapore. This south-east Asian country enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the world. We have faith that the Palestinians are capable of achieving similar success, and we will continue to work tirelessly with our partners across the negotiating table to establish an autonomous Palestinian state where the people will institute a modern economy based on science, technology and the benefits of peace. Establishing a single multinational country is a tenuous path that does not bode well for peace but, rather, enforces the conflict&apos;s perpetuation. Lebanon, ravaged by bloodshed and instability, represents only one of many examples of an undesirable quagmire of this nature. The difficulties of a two-state solution are numerous, but it remains the only realistic and moral formula to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Those not committed to this solution argue that, after the creation of a Palestinian state, Israel&apos;s waist would be too narrow \u2013 some six miles \u2013 to ensure security for its citizens. Indeed, six miles will be too narrow to guarantee full security, which only reinforces our belief that Israel&apos;s safety is not embedded only in territorial defense but in peace. Peace provides breadth of wings, even when the waist is narrow. Last month, Libyan leader Muammar Qaddhafi outlined his suggestions for a one-state solution. Although I disagree with his formula, I am encouraged by the manner in which he elucidates and builds his case. Mostly, this is salient in his fundamental and central premise that &quot;The Jewish people want and deserve their homeland.&quot; The resonance of these words is crucial, for they diametrically oppose the radical Muslim elements that reject the very right of the Jewish people to a homeland in the land of their forefathers and, on this basis, advocate a murderous jihad war whose goal is to destroy Israel. The Jewish people want and deserve to live in peace in their rightful, historical homeland. The Palestinian people want and deserve their own land, their own political institutions and their right to self-determination. It is vital that this cause be based on the prospect of coexistence between Jews and Arabs, which translates into cooperation in fields such as the economy, tourism, the environment and defence. Achieving all this will be possible only by granting each people its own state and borders, to enable their citizens to pray according to their faiths, cultivate their cultures, speak their own languages and safeguard their heritages. Let us commit our most concerted effort to allow these two states to flourish. Maybe one day, Israelis and Palestinians will choose, as in Europe, not to allow borders to inhibit economic coordination or to serve as a reason for war.

But we shouldn&apos;t let this set a precedent that starves the FSA of the expertise it has so desperately lacked over the years. Bankers may have been a part of the problem but we shouldn&apos;t dismiss the notion that they may be a significant part of the solution, too. When Frank Abagnale Jr was captured after famously forging $2.5m-worth of cheques in the 1960s, the US federal government ended up seeking his help in their fight against fraud, ultimately proving so effective that to this day, he is a consultant and lecturer to the FBI.  The same might hold true for some bankers. Yes, there are very valid questions of bankers&apos; suitability and judgment for helping resolve the mess that we find ourselves in. But while the FSA is well-equipped to deal with most parts of banking, it&apos;s clear there is a large swath of complex financial market activity for which they are ill-equipped and underqualified.  It&apos;s not just an issue of funding and pay, as Tony Tan Keng-Yam, the Executive Director of Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund GIC, argued at Davos. Neither is it an issue of whether regulators are technically able to deal with the complex derivatives and structured products activities that investment banks engage in.  It is one of psychology. Professor Charles Goodhart argued at a January Treasury Select Committee meeting that regulators could not &quot;take the punch bowl when the party is going \u2026&quot; during the credit bubble because &quot;\u2026 that was not a popular activity.&quot; But giving them the ability, power and influence to do what&apos;s unpopular in the future isn&apos;t enough. They need to stop the party before it gets going.  Quite simply, it&apos;s just not good enough for a regulator to be reactive when bankers create something. They need to be preemptive by understanding what the next logical evolution of any product or deal might be, so that it&apos;s nipped in the bud at the earliest possible stage, long before banks even get there. And to do that, an understanding of the commercial, profit-hungry mindset of bankers is essential, something that bankers themselves could best provide.  Even if bankers didn&apos;t intentionally create the credit crunch, they&apos;d obviously need to be put on a leash but this would enable the FSA to better understand whether a financial market product is genuinely valuable to the broader economy in the long run or whether it carries other risks if the idea is taken too far. More importantly, it would introduce a natural element of caution into bankers because of the knowledge they are being regulating, not by inexperienced regulators whom, in the past, they could have easily brushed aside, but by a group of technically able individuals with similar instincts. Take the securitisation markets. In its most basic form, securitisation is a sound mechanism that even academics, like Goodhart, think is valuable to the overall functioning of the economy. It spreads the risk of asset lending to an investor base comfortable with taking it. The credit crunch was not the fault of securitisation itself, but of taking this good idea to such an extreme it could only end in tears. After all, when mortgage-backed securities are being re-securitised into CDOs, which were then re-securitised into other CDOs to create CDO Squareds, the logic of securitisation ceases to be sensible. But even if they had recognised this, as and when it happened, it would have been too late and the damage would have already been done. A banker-mindset would have had far greater probability of spotting this possibility long before the party ever got going.  Given the nature of the current crisis, it&apos;s unlikely that the securitisation markets could ever be blown into such absurd proportions, at least in our lifetimes, but the financial markets that need to be regulated are much broader and technical than just the securitisation markets. In fact, securitisation departments as a contributor to investment banking revenues were, on the whole, a fraction of most firm&apos;s annual profits over the last few years, which also explains why there was a distinct lack of oversight.  Sir James Crosby&apos;s resignation may be justified, but we shouldn&apos;t let this deprive the FSA of the weapon it so crucially needs to be truly effective."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/12/virgin-atlantic-job-cuts", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines owns the remaining 49% of the business."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-12T15:44:22Z", "title": "Virgin Atlantic to cut 600 jobs", "tags": ["Virgin Atlantic", "British Airways", "Global recession", "Airline industry", "World news", "UK news", "Travel", "Air transport"], "article": "Virgin Atlantic is cutting 600 jobs, or about 7% of its workforce, as long-haul air travel suffers in the economic downturn.

Virgin Atlantic is hoping to relieve some of the pressure on its business by getting involved in the imminent takeover of BMI, Heathrow airport&apos;s second largest carrier, by Germany&apos;s Lufthansa. However, it is not clear whether Sir Richard&apos;s Virgin Group is willing to dilute its 51% stake in the airline, and cede control of it, as part of the deal.

A day&apos;s listening later, I&apos;d got that down to 29, then, finally 20. In that time I&apos;d travelled from the depths of the human heart to the furthest reaches of outer space, from joyously colour-saturated art-pop and a clattering Victorian sea-shanty to growlingly heavy space rock and startlingly minimalist hip-hop.  Along the way there was a fair amount of discussion about what really qualifies as adventure, but what began to bubble up as the list got slowly whittled down to the final 10 was the idea that adventure is situated somewhere between dreams and reality, between life as we know it and death as we fear it. The songs that made the final list all had an extra dimension to them, a sense that the artist was reinterpreting and reimagining their own life as they went along. Though I doubt even Tom Waits has really &quot;walked the sewers of Paris&quot; or, indeed, &quot;dangled from a rope of sand&quot;, he still sounds pretty close to the subject.  Elizabeth Cotten wrote Freight Train in 1906 when she was just 11. She&apos;d never actually ridden one, but the sense that this wondrous invention could deliver adventures even death couldn&apos;t end had obviously already taken hold, &quot;When I die, Lord, bury me deep, way down on old Chestnut Street,&quot; she sings, some 50 years later, &quot;then I can hear old Number 9, as she comes rolling by.&quot; Merz&apos;s adventures take place aboard the boat he rides with his beloved (&quot;when all the chip shops have closed, when all the drunks have gone home&quot;), the pair climbing silver ladders to the moon. Follow the Leader is total adventure, a song completely untethered even by gravity, Rakim inviting us all to &quot;travel at magnificent speeds around the universe&quot;, while for Kate Bush, the mysteries and brilliance of that universe are no less complicated, or endlessly fascinating, than trying to map the dark contours of her heart.  The Cramps&apos; adventure pulls the focus right in close to concentrate on the fantastical unravelling of &quot;a she-feast wrapped in silk&quot;. More delicately, the ebb and flow of a lifetime&apos;s friendship causes Nanci Griffith to consider how an adventure that&apos;s constantly under threat by love, jealousy and loss still survives. It&apos;s just such a miracle that makes the unnamed San Quentin prisoner&apos;s dreams of wandering in Johnny Cash&apos;s I Don&apos;t Know Where I&apos;m Bound all the more painful. After so much longing, it&apos;s heartening to hear how many of the Human League&apos;s adventurous desires are wonderfully simple - &quot;New York, ice cream, TV, travel, good times ...&quot; - and what&apos;s not to like there? Finally, could you resist I-Roy&apos;s call for adventure: &quot;Right out about now people, we&apos;re heading to Mars, look out thru&apos; the window and count the stars.

It has become fashionable to attack aid to Africa; an overdose of celebrity lobbying and compassion fatigue have prompted harsh critiques of what exactly aid has achieved in the past 50 years. Not all of the criticism has been unjustified - $300bn of aid has gone to Africa since 1970, yet average incomes across much of the continent have stagnated or fallen. Dead Aid offers a disastrous history of how aid was used as a tool of the cold war.  The problem is that this kind of analysis (much of which is now only of historical relevance) provides ammunition for those who are sceptical of international responsibilities and always keen to keep charity at home. And here they have the perfect protagonist to advance their arguments: an African woman who speaks their language.  The author, Dambisa Moyo, worked for Goldman Sachs (a fact about which the dust jacket is strangely coy) after a stint at the World Bank and a doctorate at Oxford. One suspects that behind this book is a remarkable woman with an impressive career and very little time for learning how to write a good book. The result is an erratic, breathless sweep through aid history and current policy options for Africa, sprinkled with the odd statistic. There are so many generalisations skidding over decades of history, such frequent pre-emptory glib conclusions, that it is likely to leave you dizzy with silent protest. For example, in a breezy overview of explanations for Africa&apos;s economic backwardness, Moyo turns to the harshness of the continent&apos;s geography and points out that &quot;Saudi Arabia is rather hot, and of course, Switzerland is landlocked, but these factors have not stopped them getting on with it&quot;. Yes, but perhaps Saudi&apos;s vast oil reserves and tiny population, and Switzerland&apos;s position as a banking centre at the heart of Europe, are part of the explanation? Relevant here would have been Paul Collier&apos;s analysis of the role of geography in his recent book The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It, but he only makes it into the bibliography. Colonialism is treated similarly. The partitioning of Africa at the 1884-85 Berlin conference &quot;did not help matters&quot;. Um, you could say. But by the next paragraph, Moyo is already on to racism and Max Weber&apos;s analysis of Protestantism and capitalism. This is Moyo at her weakest; she is an economist by training and her grasp of the political economy of Africa is lamentable. Time and again, she fails to grapple with the single biggest factor determining the poverty of the continent - how the state functions, and has failed to function. Why has there been so much civil war and so many corrupt dictators? Why is it that Ghana and Singapore had roughly the same income levels in the 1950s, and are now poles apart? The keys to success in many Asian countries were the role of a strong, interventionist state that nurtured industry and an elite who invested in their own country: both have been missing in many African countries, where elites have exported capital to western bank accounts and pursued ruinous policies. But Moyo is not interested in the role of the state. She believes in the private sector and free enterprise. In one of the most unconvincing sections, she argues that it is aid which causes corruption and conflict, and aid which inhibits social capital and foreign investment. Cut the aid flows and, with help from China, African economies will boom and there will be good governance. Add a dose of microfinance, some remittances from the growing African diaspora and some borrowing on the international bond market - and hey presto! Moyo insists it really is that simple.  Some of her prescriptions seem to fall foul of the credit crunch: borrowing capital for infrastructure is not going to be easy now. Others are faddish: many people are busily jumping on the microfinance bandwagon, but what all the old hands hasten to point out is that this is no panacea. There already exists plenty of excellent analysis on the benefits of the huge investment China is making in Africa; Moyo is telling us nothing new.  She is right, however, that there are unedifying aspects of aid - in particular, the continued protectionism of both the US and EU: every US cow brings in $2.50 in subsidies a day. She argues that western liberal anxiety about suffering in Africa would be better deployed ensuring fair-trade terms on commodities such as cotton and sugar. She quotes research that western sugar subsidies have cost Ethiopia, Mozambique and Malawi $238m since 2001. What she doesn&apos;t acknowledge is that these trade injustices are the target of vociferous campaigns by organisations such as Oxfam - organisations that represent the western liberalism she excoriates (while relying heavily on their data). Despite being poorly argued, Dead Aid will boost Moyo&apos;s profile. There are many who will want to promote her views, only too eager to cut aid budgets as pressure builds on government spending. The danger is that she will end up on the wrong side of the argument. The battle is to press for more effective aid, not cut it altogether. Her proposal to phase out aid in five years is disastrously irresponsible: it would lead to the closure of thousands of schools and clinics across Africa, and an end to the HIV antiretroviral, malaria and TB programmes, along with emergency food supplies, on which millions of lives depend.  \u2022 Madeleine Bunting&apos;s Willing Slaves: How the Overwork Culture is Ruling Our Lives is published by Harper Perennial"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/17/teaching-awards-schools-singapore", "sentences": ["The answers are found in Singapore.", "I have just accompanied winners of the Teaching Awards on a study visit to Singapore.", "But Singapore has many similarities to the UK.", "Singapore is a multi-ethnic, multilingual society.", "Pupils are obsessed with mobile phones and computer games, and are, as one Singapore school principal put it, the &quot;strawberry generation: easily bruised and damaged&quot;.", "Like England, Singapore is undergoing a big school building programme.", "Perhaps the real key to Singapore&apos;s success, though, is the rare combination of traditional teaching and discipline, and a holistic, child-based approach."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-17T00:01:00Z", "title": "Winners of Teaching Awards learn lessons from Singapore", "tags": ["Schools", "Teaching awards", "Education", "World news", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "How do you achieve a school system consistently in the top three in the world for maths and science, fourth for literacy, and described by experts as leading the world in teaching quality? Moreover, how do you manage to get 80% of pupils to pass five or more O-levels when they are taught in their second language in classes of 35? The answers are found in Singapore. I have just accompanied winners of the Teaching Awards on a study visit to Singapore. It was organised by the charity CfBT Education Trust, which has sent British teachers to several countries to see what they can learn from other school systems. So what did they expect to find? One assistant headteacher from the Midlands expected to see &quot;a very traditional curriculum, rows of pupils, teacher in front, students there to learn&quot;. And indeed she did. But she also saw a whole lot more: traditional methods blended with more progressive thinking, and a focus on teaching the whole child, not just on exam results. It gave the British teachers plenty to ponder. International comparisons are fraught with difficulties; it is easy to forget that what works in one country will not flourish in another. But Singapore has many similarities to the UK. The official language of school instruction is English, there is a national curriculum, and the national examinations are O- and A-levels, administered by Cambridge Assessment. It was soon clear to the British teachers that there are similar challenges. Singapore is a multi-ethnic, multilingual society. Pupils are obsessed with mobile phones and computer games, and are, as one Singapore school principal put it, the &quot;strawberry generation: easily bruised and damaged&quot;. So why does it work? First, education is the government&apos;s top priority. That is not just rhetoric: a country with no natural resources (it even has to import water) knows it lives and dies by its collective brainpower. The ministry of education is very close to schools; as all teachers and principals are civil servants, they regularly rotate through postings to the ministry. Teachers speak approvingly of the way the ministry supports initiatives with targeted funding. Or, as one former headteacher put it, the system runs on &quot;top-down support for bottom-up initiatives&quot;. For example, there is a drive to boost learning outside the classroom. The government provides funds for school visits, clubs and extra-curricular activities, enabling them to make such activities compulsory. Pupils are regularly graded on these activities, and the grades count towards entry to further education. In another reform, the ministry announced recently that all primary schools would move to single-session teaching, with the juniors taught in the morning and the infants in the afternoon. This will bring smaller classes, better pupil-teacher ratios, and allow a programme of compulsory extra-curricular activities for the juniors in the afternoon. Like England, Singapore is undergoing a big school building programme. But there is no disruption while the builders are in, as the whole school decamps to a vacant school nearby. The government maintains spare capacity for this very purpose. In a reform called the Integrated Programme, schools with more able pupils are encouraged to bypass exams at 16, allowing greater curriculum flexibility right through to A-levels. One visiting headteacher from Essex was struck by the real stretch offered to more able pupils, the &quot;clear articulation of ideas between government and schools&quot;, and the way the whole system not only &quot;talked the talk, but also walked the walk&quot;. Perhaps the real key to Singapore&apos;s success, though, is the rare combination of traditional teaching and discipline, and a holistic, child-based approach. In the UK, we tend to see these as mutually exclusive opposites. mikebakereducation.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/18/ferris-wheel-big-attraction", "sentences": ["The Great Wheel Corporation is responsible for the wheels going up in Beijing, Berlin and Orlando as well as the world&apos;s current biggest wheel, in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-18T00:01:00Z", "title": "What's the big attraction of the ferris wheel? Stuart Jeffries finds out", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "Travel", "Cities"], "article": "When World Tourist Attractions erected a 60m-high ferris wheel in Birmingham&apos;s Centenary Square in 2003, there was an unexpected bonus. As passengers rose in their gondolas above canals, tower blocks, dual carriageways and derelict factories, they heard a commentary in French. The Birmingham wheel, you see, had previously been installed in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. But, instead of visitors being told that if they looked to the left they could see the Carrefour de Pates (Spaghetti Junction) and, if they looked right, l&apos;Anneau du Taureau (the Bullring), the commentary pointed out Parisian landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame and the Arc de Triomphe. &quot;[It&apos;s] disappointing,&quot; said a council spokesman, &quot;as there are so many great things to say about our city.&quot; This is true: Birmingham is known, thanks to its canals, as the Venice of the North. But even Venice can&apos;t boast gondolas that rise above the ground and fly in circles.  Birmingham, like everywhere else, had to have its wheel. Britain&apos;s second city&apos;s wheel was a temporary phenomenon, like those that went up over the past few years in York, Newcastle and Plymouth, but Manchester and Belfast still have them. Jay Pender, commercial manager of World Tourist Attractions, says business is booming. &quot;We can&apos;t really build them fast enough, but that&apos;s OK by us.&quot; Hasn&apos;t the credit crunch dampened demand for this pastime? &quot;Not at all. We don&apos;t know why there is so much demand, but there is. Three more WTA wheels are opening in Australia this year. Success breeds success,&quot; he says.  Pender&apos;s firm supplies temporary big wheels that can be rolled into town and out again. Its parent company, Great City Attractions, also owns the Great Wheel Corporation, which is responsible for a rash of huge permanent wheels (some more than 200m high) around the globe. &quot;The budget and the sky really are the limit,&quot; he says.  So what is the attraction? &quot;There is something iconic about really big wheels that gives the impression of modern go-ahead cities,&quot; says a Visit Britain spokeswoman. &quot;In places like York, a modern, gleaming big wheel can complement the historic sites and architecture.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s true,&quot; says Pender. &quot;We find that in places like Belfast they have become symbols of resurgence, which is a nice thing to be associated with. For instance, we&apos;re putting a 60m wheel up at the seafront in Weston-super-Mare in May, which is just the thing the place needs after the pier burned down last year. Even though they aren&apos;t designed as permanent structures, people often want them to be permanent because they become so fondly regarded.&quot;  Today, it seems, any city that wants to prove its municipal virility and seal its international status has a permanent, beautifully designed ferris wheel complete with air-conditioned gondolas and an allied shopping mall at ground level. &quot;It&apos;s a shame that this is happening,&quot; says George Ferguson, former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, director of Acanthus Ferguson Mann Architects and a man who has spent many happy half hours aboard the world&apos;s big wheels, &quot;because, for me, part of the magic of ferris wheels was that they were ephemeral&quot;. Like skyscrapers, ferris wheels are becoming fixtures on our cityscapes. The London Eye, conceived as a temporary structure and built at a cost of \u00a375m, has been such a triumph that it seems to have become permanent. Since it opened in March 2000, more than 32 million people have travelled on it - at least 15,000 visitors a day pay up to \u00a315.50 for a ride. Despite this, the wheel (now owned by Merlin Entertainments, which runs 26 Sea Life attractions, five dungeons, four Legoland parks, five theme parks and seven Madame Tussauds) has failed to turn a profit for most of its existence - and its owners won&apos;t say if it&apos;s currently making money. However, inspired by its apparent popularity, bigger ferris wheels are springing up around the world. Like opera houses, like high-spec-designed provincial galleries with little to go in them, like bombastic lumps of sculpture in our public squares, they are must-haves for any city with more ambition than imagination.  &quot;It&apos;s always dubious when cities go &apos;me too&apos;,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;It&apos;s like having the biggest building in the world. It&apos;s completely infantile. The big wheels are becoming the new little boys&apos; game.&quot;  The soon-to-be world&apos;s biggest ferris wheel is currently rising above Beijing. It will be the seventh to go up in a Chinese city since the millennium. When it opens later this year, the 208m Beijing Great Wheel will allow passengers to see the Great Wall of China in the mountains to the north on sunny days (which is something that even Birmingham&apos;s couldn&apos;t claim). Dubai, global centre of architectural hackdom, opened a wheel last year that is bigger than the London Eye. Even Baghdad has announced plans for a giant wheel larger than the Eye as part of a rebranding exercise (which also includes the creation of a &quot;romantic&quot; island on the river Tigris) aimed at making the Iraqi capital a leisure-friendly city. The Great Wheel Corporation is responsible for the wheels going up in Beijing, Berlin and Orlando as well as the world&apos;s current biggest wheel, in Singapore. Next year, Berlin&apos;s wheel will rise in the Hertzallee near the city zoo, making it the biggest in Europe. Why Berlin? In 2007, Berlin had 7.6 million guests, who booked a total of over 17 million overnight stays - the fourth annual record in a row. The company believes the city will continue to prosper as &quot;the ultimate tourist destination&quot;. Whether this hope is well-founded in recession remains to be seen. One problem, surely, is the existence of the Fernsehturm (TV tower), which has a rotating visitor platform 365m above the city&apos;s Alexanderplatz. From it you can see, according to the promotional bumf, &quot;ganz Berlin auf einen Blick&quot; (all Berlin in one glance).  Soon, then, the London Eye, the cantilevered beauty designed by Marks Barfield architects (who prefer their creation to be known not as a ferris wheel but as an observation wheel) will be only the sixth or seventh tallest wheel in the world as other cities seek to copy its business model. &quot;To my mind the London Eye has never been bettered,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;The fact that it is a cantilevered rather than a spoked wheel is part of its appeal, as is the fact that you see it in different lights and from different angles wherever you are in central London. It has become a lovable landmark in itself.&quot;  Indeed, the London Eye may well be more a symbol of the city in the new millennium than Norman Foster&apos;s Gherkin or the Houses of Parliament. This is significant: the Eye thereby helps define the British capital not so much as financial hub or home of the mother of parliaments, but, one might think, as a post-industrial fairground. Which, in a sense, it is. Not to be outdone, Belfast has a wheel, billed as the city&apos;s &quot;own version of the London Eye&quot;. The best thing about it (apart, obviously, from the view) is that you can hire a VIP gondola with champagne for \u00a370. It has one drawback, though: it only takes 12 minutes to complete a circuit. That&apos;s no good, as the people who set up a ferris wheel in the Japanese city of Fukuoka realised. The Fukuoka Sky Dream claims that its slow speed (0.6 miles per hour) offers &quot;maximum kissing time&quot;. Good point: much of the charm of the ferris wheel, surely, is to take a slow ride of about 30 minutes towards a destination that is the least interesting thing about the journey, during which time you should be savouring the shifting panorama, mutating light effects and your partner&apos;s lips. The key constraint in what ferris-wheel designers call &quot;flight time&quot; is the dearth of on-board toilet facilities: if the journey takes much more than 45 minutes, even those who have been crossing their legs will do more than whimper. Sceptics will suggest there is surely little else to do once aboard the Fukuoka Sky Dream but snog since if you look out of your window you will see only an ever-changing vista of, erm, Fukuoka which, whatever else it is, is not Rome. That, though, is unfair. There is at least one thing worth seeing in Fukuoka. The city has not one but two wheels parked at a right angle to each other. As a result, you can look at one from the other when you get sore lips from kissing. Looking is the key pleasure offered by the eyes that spin above our cities. &quot;Part of the magic of the ferris wheel is that it&apos;s usually a half-hour trip,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;Buildings change their appearances as you move and as the light changes when you&apos;re on the Eye. You can&apos;t get that anywhere else in London, even in the National Portrait Gallery restaurant, which has the second-best views of London.&quot; At best the ferris wheel offers a vertical experience akin to the horizontal one Proust described in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu, when his hero travelled on a coach through the French countryside and saw three church spires swap position and change colour as dusk descended. &quot;I&apos;m not somebody who goes round the world visiting every ferris wheel,&quot; says Ferguson, &quot;but I did have a wonderful time in Chicago&apos;s at the Navy Pier. It was a slightly odd experience, though, certainly very different from the London one, because the wheel in Chicago is much smaller than the skyscrapers around it.&quot; Chicago&apos;s biggest building, the Sears Tower, is 442m high (527 if you include the antenna), while the Navy Pier ferris wheel is 46m high. So why would you bother going on a seven-minute ferris-wheel journey in a circle above (but only just) Chicago? One answer is for historical reasons. It was in Chicago in 1893 that the first ferris wheel went up (the current one is a copy). It was built by George Washington Gale Ferris, who designed an 80m wheel to really stick it to the French, who had built the Eiffel Tower four years earlier. That Ferris didn&apos;t succeed in this aim is hardly the point. Ferris unwittingly created something more readily reproducible than Gustave Eiffel&apos;s miracle of air and steel. After 1893, ferris wheels were soon going up all over Europe and America - in Blackpool, Vienna, Earls Court, Ocean City, even Paris. Despite all the hoopla about big wheels as iconic structures in the new millennium, it is surely significant that Shanghai, one of the world&apos;s fastest rising cities and China&apos;s commercial centre, decided to scrap its 2002 plans to build the world&apos;s biggest wheel. The Shanghai Star was to have been constructed on top of a 50m-high entertainment complex on the Huangpu river, near the Bund waterfront. The idea was that the Shanghai Star would open in 2008 and would be one of the projects that would make Shanghai&apos;s 2010 World Expo a triumph. But it never happened. In 2005, new mayor Han Zheng described the wheel as &quot;politically incorrect&quot; and expendable. In this, you might think, he was prescient. A big wheel could become a big white elephant in an unpropitious economic climate. There was, surely, another reason the Shanghai wheel was nixed. There are already lots of skyscrapers from which one can have a good view of the city. London was not like that: it had few tall buildings and few commanding vistas. The London Eye thus offered something new in a city that hitherto hadn&apos;t cared to look at itself. Thus, the London Eye&apos;s success may not be so readily reproducible elsewhere. Ferris wheels, if too much copied, are nonetheless beautiful things. There is a particularly lovely one at Deno&apos;s Wonder Wheel Park on Coney Island that went up in the 1920s and thrillingly features two wheels of gondolas, one inside the other. The Wonder Wheel was built by the Eccentric Ferris Wheel Company and when there was a power cut in July 1977 all riders were brought down safely because forbiddingly butch Americans hand-cranked the thing. There is a replica of the Wonder Wheel in Yokohama but the Japanese one doesn&apos;t of course have views of the New York city skyline or indeed the New Jersey coast. But my all-time favourite human-bearing spinning wheel is the 17th-century Turkish proto-ferris wheel called the &quot;Ups and Downs&quot;. It looks less like a fairground attraction and more like a means of firing troops from their rotating seats over a city wall to break a siege. If only Birmingham had imported that one (ideally with Turkish commentary) rather than the relatively conventional Parisian version, Brummies could have seized Coventry. What is the future for big wheels? Will Beijing remain the biggest wheel in the world for long, or will some strutting pretender quickly eclipse it, possibly giving us 360-degree views over Swindon and the Wiltshire countryside? Is there any technical constraint on the diameter of a ferris wheel, or will our descendants be able to touch the stars from their gondolas? &quot;There are sensible constraints over wheel size, just as there are with wind turbines,&quot; says Ferguson. &quot;But such is human ingenuity that even those constraints could be overcome. &quot;What I hope,&quot; he adds wearily, &quot;is that on a drawing board somewhere, someone is creating something new that will replace ferris wheels, because we&apos;ve surely had enough of them.&quot; What does he have in mind? &quot;I hope it would be something that wasn&apos;t just a two-dimensional experience - because, after all, ferris wheels only use two planes - but a 3D one. &quot; What that will look like we don&apos;t yet know, but it could be fun trying to imagine."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2009/feb/18/ftse-royalbankofscotlandgroup1", "sentences": ["However, Liberty International bucked the negative trend on rumours that it could avoid going down the same route as its peers by spinning off its non-retail division and opting for a share placing with selected investors such as the government of Singapore or the family of founder Sir Donald Gordon."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-18T18:01:25Z", "title": "FTSE teeters on the brink", "tags": ["Business", "FTSE", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Barclays", "Standard Chartered", "HSBC", "Legal and General", "Prudential", "Aviva", "Amlin", "Admiral", "Standard Life", "Brixton", "Segro", "Hammerson", "British Land", "Land Securities", "Liberty International"], "article": "The FTSE 100 closed just the right side of the 4000-point mark today as it recorded its fifth successive day of decline.

The blue-chip index spent much of the day beneath the psychologically important level amid a sense of gloom about the economy. It closed down 27.30 points at 4006.83, its lowest level since 21 November. Financial companies, energy groups and property developers were among those sending the index lower. Banks slipped as investors weighed up how much they would have to pay in fees for putting toxic assets into the government&apos;s insurance scheme. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 70%-owned by the government and may have to pay more than \u00a34bn to participate in the scheme, was the FTSE 100&apos;s biggest faller, sliding 2.6p to 18.1p.

Monte Carlo has one, Valencia and Singapore have them and now the Italian capital is pushing to host an F1 city circuit event. But the plan has rekindled Italy&apos;s more traditional - and less sporting - passion for regional backstabbing, with northern politicians claiming Rome should &quot;stick to chariot races&quot; and leave Italian formula one racing where it belongs, at the Monza racetrack in Lombardy. The dissenters appear to have won over the Ferrari chairman, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo. Rome, he said, has no need for a formula one race to boost its image. &quot;If attention is going to be paid to the city then I think it should focus on investment in infrastructure, security and lighting,&quot; Montezemolo said, an apparent reference to the rape of a 14-year-old girl in a dimly lit suburban park in the city on Saturday. Following reports that two Romanian men carried out the rape, a hooded gang raided a nearby bar favoured by Romanians on Sunday, assaulting customers. A day later soldiers and police bulldozed illegal shacks hidden in woods on the outskirts of Rome housing up to 500 people, including illegal Romanian migrants. The city council is eyeing the Esposizione Universale Roma district as the potential site for its grand prix circuit, a series of wide, tree-lined streets built by Mussolini and dominated by the Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana, an icon of fascist architecture known as the Square Colosseum. The former Italian formula two champion Maurizio Flammini, who is backing the bid and recruiting investors, said Bernie Ecclestone, head of formula one, was &quot;very interested&quot; in bringing a grand prix to Rome. Flammini added the race would cost up to \u20ac130m to stage using private finance, and would attract up to 350,000 spectators over three days. &quot;The revenue produced in Rome by the annual staging of the grand prix will mean funds for social services, sports and culture in the city,&quot; said the Rome city council assessor for sports, Alessandro Cochi. The Corriere della Sera newspaper said yesterday that cash was needed instead to fill the thousands of potholes that plague the lives of motorists in the capital, some big enough to swallow a Ferrari. &quot;Holding a car race in Rome, the capital of traffic jams and craters, is a true paradox,&quot; said politician Fabio Desideri, who opposes the bid. Italy&apos;s Northern League party has condemned the bid as another example of &quot;Roma ladrona&quot;, or &quot;thieving Rome&quot;. &quot;I would remind Rome&apos;s politicians that car racing in this country means Monza,&quot; said Claudio D&apos;Amico, a member of parliament for the party.  &quot;Since Rome seems to have no new ideas, here is one - rebuild the Circus Maximus and hold chariot races, which will be a great success and stop you bothering the north.&quot; Flammini said he believed the in-fighting would be shortlived. &quot;The League insists every region pays its way,&quot; said the retired driver. &quot;The north should be applauding a profitable business idea which means it will have fork over less public money to the south.&quot; Claudio Barbaro, an MP in prime minister Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s Freedom People party, said Montezemolo had not ruled out holding the race in Rome. &quot;He just needed to say what he did to remain neutral.

But with the country&apos;s export-led economy taking a beating in the global slowdown and the vital tourism sector that once drew 14 million visitors to jungles and pristine beaches still suffering, anything is worth a try.  The hope is that the heady brew will ease the pain caused by 300,000 stranded foreign travellers at the start of the peak season when Bangkok&apos;s main international airport was closed by anti-government protesters for eight days. Thailand&apos;s tourist resorts and hotels - major contributors to the economy - are still feeling the effects. But perhaps the Siam sunray - coined to evoke Thailand&apos;s ancient name - may leave a better taste and instil a collective amnesia among the travelling public. &quot;Thailand&apos;s new signature drink is based on very Thai ingredients,&quot; said the tourism authority. &quot;Successful signature drinks are one way to fast-track holiday destinations on to the world tourism map.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/feb/21/capital-letters", "sentences": ["Don&apos;t bank on this land for making a profit  A company called Profitable Group is offering UK land for sale here in Singapore on TV adverts.", "As it is very hard to find out information here, can you tell me what you know about Profitable?CC, Singapore  This is landbanking - a get-rich-quick scheme that has never delivered except for the promoters, who can multiply their investment in land many times over - \u00a310,000 an acre agricultural land is sold for \u00a3100,000 by landbankers.", "The main board of this Singapore-based company also includes Tim Goldring, John Nordmann, James Hodgson and Nigel Blanchard, who were also directors of UK-based Profitable Plot Company."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-21T00:01:00Z", "title": "Consumer champion Tony Levene fights for your rights", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Money"], "article": " That sinking feeling over a subsidence claim We have our buildings insurance through Nationwide, underwritten by Norwich Union. In 2006, we had a slight structural movement in our house. We notified the insurers immediately, made a subsidence claim (for around \u00a34,500), and the work was signed off in August 2008.  I asked Nationwide and Norwich Union what the effect on premiums would be. Both said they did not know, but both stated that without the work, our home would be uninsurable. But now Liverpool Victoria has taken over the policy. It refuses to insure us for subsidence, leaving us without cover. Please help.VW, London  You are a victim of a pass-the-parcel between LV and NU. Sometime last year, Nationwide decided it was better for itself, or for customers, to be insured via LV than NU. That may have been so. But NU was about to dump you as it, wrongly, believed that you had not finished the subsidence repair work - the loss adjusters failed to fill in the paperwork. So when the Nationwide policy moved to LV, the insurer decided not to renew your policy, even though the switch was nothing to do with you. Insurers should stick with a policyholder after a subsidence claim as the work stops the problem - but there is no binding agreement to do this. NU did not warn that you were without renewal cover when Nationwide switched underwriters. When Capital Letters called, there was some more pass-the-parcel with NU washing its hands of the problem. We argued that the change was not your fault and, while accepting LV&apos;s right not to insure properties with a subsidence history, what you wanted here was a continuation of Nationwide cover - you did not care which firm underwrote the risks. Finally, LV decided not to involve NU any more and take responsibility for insuring you. Providing you confirm the work was done to a suitable standard, it will then offer full cover.  Savings account that finally left me in debt In early January, my Bradford &amp; Bingley fixed-rate savings account matured showing \u00a316,614. I made an online request for that amount (less \u00a31, in case I ever wanted a hassle-free way of opening another B&amp;B product) to be sent to my Co-op bank account. Three days later, I checked the Co-op and found the money had not arrived. I checked with B&amp;B - the maturity sum now stood at \u00a315,818! So I tried a new transfer based on the lower amount. But instead of leaving \u00a31, I was now \u00a31.23 overdrawn, which was then taken from my B&amp;B internet saver. Please sort out B&amp;B.JL, Suffolk  Bradford &amp; Bingley&apos;s savings arm is owned by Santander, but it seems the incompetence shown by its now nationalised mortgage arm seems to have been contagious. And B&amp;B&apos;s failure to respond to complaints did not help your blood pressure. Working out a fixed-rate return over one year should be easy - B&amp;B just needed a calculator costing a fiver. But B&amp;B admits, due to a &quot;technical error&quot;, the maturity interest was overstated and this was &quot;quickly identified by internal checking procedures&quot;.  This correction crossed with your internet action, so it was rejected. The second error - the creation of a small debt - is not explained, although it was rectified. B&amp;B rightly says you cannot profit from its original error. But B&amp;B will now write to apologise, send staff to re-education camp, and compensate you with \u00a350 for the hassle - to add to the \u00a33.10 remaining in your account, a sum which you cannot understand.  Driven to distraction by Citro\u00ebn&apos;s demands In February 2004 I bought a Citro\u00ebn Xsara Picasso on a five-year finance plan from Citro\u00ebn Financial Services.  In March 2008, I was able to pay off the outstanding amount, and asked for a settlement figure which Citro\u00ebn supplied. I paid this in April 2008. But in mid-October, Citro\u00ebn wrote saying the agreement would end in February 2009. I reminded the car firm that I now owed nothing. But in December, a further letter said the agreement would be terminated when I paid the last \u00a3283. Again, Citro\u00ebn promised to look into the error and amend records. A month later, however, Citro\u00ebn asked for \u00a3192, warning me late payments would incur charges. It then said I owed nearly \u00a3500, including late payment surcharges. Please get this company off my back.PN, Lancashire  You have lost count of the times you have had to contact Citro\u00ebn, and of the promises you have had that the problem would be rectified. On one recent occasion, you were promised a letter of apology only to get another default notice.  But it seems &quot;computer glitches involving out-of-date settlement amounts&quot; are to blame. Citro\u00ebn now accepts you have paid up and says it will never bother you again.  Don&apos;t bank on this land for making a profit  A company called Profitable Group is offering UK land for sale here in Singapore on TV adverts. The deal is that you buy land without planning permission - they are selling this in Colchester and Hounslow - and wait a little while until its gets the local authority go-ahead when it will become very valuable. As it is very hard to find out information here, can you tell me what you know about Profitable?CC, Singapore  This is landbanking - a get-rich-quick scheme that has never delivered except for the promoters, who can multiply their investment in land many times over - \u00a310,000 an acre agricultural land is sold for \u00a3100,000 by landbankers. Profitable&apos;s Colchester land is protected by a covenant preventing resale at a profit, so planning gains would be difficult - and currently house demand is so low that builders have an over-supply of both homes and land. Profitable also claims interests in sport and recruitment. Former Scottish footballer Kenny Dalglish is listed as an executive on its sporting side. The main board of this Singapore-based company also includes Tim Goldring, John Nordmann, James Hodgson and Nigel Blanchard, who were also directors of UK-based Profitable Plot Company. This went into liquidation last year after failing to produce accounts and, after three years of landbanking, sales in the UK did not produce the big gains promised.  Boiler rooms backfire on Leeds solicitors The Financial Services Authority has won its appeal against Fox Hayes, a Leeds firm of solicitors which used its status as an FSA-authorised firm to approve promotional material from Spanish boiler rooms, overturning an adverse October 2007 Financial Services and Markets Tribunal ruling.  Guardian Money first revealed, in January 2004, how Fox Hayes gave Madrid boiler rooms Walker Stone and Tresaderns, which sold worthless shares, a veneer of respectability.  In all, the FSA says Fox Hayes approved 34 financial promotions for five unauthorised, unregulated, overseas companies between 2003 and 2004, enabling the boiler rooms to &quot;illegally sell shares worth about $21m (\u00a314.7m) to 670 UK investors&quot;. The Court of Appeal increased the penalty against the solicitors firm from \u00a3146,000 to \u00a3954,770.  Former Fox Hayes senior partner Robert Manning resigned in 2007 after his role in secret commission-sharing ventures was revealed. He made \u00a3455,000 from this deal. At the appeal Lord Justice Longmore said that &quot;there was serious doubt the overseas companies would deal with UK investors in an honest and reliable way&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/22/cricket-allen-stanford", "sentences": ["If you take the next step and go through the rest you find that another 15 are former British colonies - Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the Cook Islands, Cyprus, Dominica, Grenada, Hong Kong, Malta, Nauru, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and Singapore.", "Cyprus, Malta and Singapore became tax havens of their own accord and the Cook Islands are more New Zealand&apos;s responsibility than Britain&apos;s.

Not only did they have to grasp how they had thrown away a Test-winning position a village team could have held on to, but they also faced the perplexing question of why the English cricket authorities allowed them to become a spiv&apos;s plaything. The Stanford story is fast moving, but as of yesterday the facts of the case were that in June last year Sir Allen landed on the sacred turf of Lord&apos;s in a black helicopter bearing a crateful of dollars. The bills turned out to be replicas rather than the real McCoy, but the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) did not smell a rat. Sir Allen then appeared to make good on his promise to inject tens of millions into the game. He invited the England team to a high-stakes tournament in Antigua, a country he seemed to own.  During a warm-up match, he was caught on camera warming up the players&apos; wives and girlfriends by hugging them and bouncing them on his knee. Understandably, their husbands and boyfriends decided that Stanford was not the sort of businessman they wanted to work for and some were prepared to make that point to him very forcibly indeed. The ECB saw nothing amiss, however, and told the players to calm down. Meanwhile, the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank was selling \u00a38bn worth of &quot;certificates of deposit&quot; which promised investors extraordinarily generous returns. The old maxim in finance is that if an investment seems too good to be true then it probably is. Not one of the alleged men of the world on the ECB management board remembered this wise advice as they rushed to salute Sir Allen as a saviour of the game. It was only when the American Securities and Exchange Commission accused him last week of engaging in a &quot;massive ongoing fraud&quot; of &quot;shocking magnitude&quot; that the ECB realised that maybe, just maybe, Sir Allen might not play with a straight bat. I don&apos;t know how much post-colonial literature Test players read. But if they want to understand how they were caught up in Sir Allen&apos;s schemes, they could make a start with VS Naipaul&apos;s sceptical essays in The Overcrowded Barracoon. Naipaul had toured the West Indies in the late Sixties as they were considering breaking away from the British Empire and becoming independent nations. He expressed his doubts most forcibly about Anguilla, but they applied equally to nearby Antigua, St Kitts and all the other statelets of the Caribbean.  These were tiny colonies &quot;set adrift, part of the jetsam of an empire,&quot; he wrote. How were they going to make a living? The Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London replied with a disgraceful answer even the jaundiced Naipaul did not expect. The fragments of empire, those little specks of land with apparently no viable future, would survive by turning themselves into tax havens. Justifiably or not, colonial guilt still haunts the British. But we are nowhere near guilty enough about the immoral policy of successive governments of encouraging existing British territories and former colonies to become centres of money laundering. In a bill he presented to the US Congress last year, Barack Obama identified 34 tax havens for the wealthy. As I have mentioned before, if you follow Obama&apos;s classification, you find by my reckoning that Britain controls nine of them - Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey/Sark/Alderney, the Isle of Man, Jersey and the Turks and Caicos Islands. If you take the next step and go through the rest you find that another 15 are former British colonies - Antigua, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the Cook Islands, Cyprus, Dominica, Grenada, Hong Kong, Malta, Nauru, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and Singapore. Cyprus, Malta and Singapore became tax havens of their own accord and the Cook Islands are more New Zealand&apos;s responsibility than Britain&apos;s. But especially in the Caribbean, Britain consciously transformed colonial and post-colonial territories into receivers of stolen goods. Because of what we have done, the profits from the drugs trade are recycled - as was to be expected, the US press reported last week that blood-soaked Mexican cartels were laundering their profits in Antigua - and, of course, working- and middle-class citizens are forced to make up the taxes the rich divert to the havens. British policy also means, however, that when desperate men need cash in a hurry, the odds are that they will turn to tycoons like Sir Allen who have built their fortunes free from the interference of regulators and tax inspectors. &quot;Desperate&quot; accurately describes the ECB&apos;s managers, because of another twist in post-colonial history I suspect that Straussy and his team-mates grasp better than I do: the emergence of India as the centre of word cricket. As the scandal grew, I spoke to Ramachandra Guha, whose history of Indian cricket, A Corner of a Foreign Field, is now available in the UK. To my surprise, he was not enjoying a laugh at the ECB&apos;s expense. He deplored the high-paying Indian Twenty20 cricket competitions - &quot;The purist in me finds them vulgar.&quot; As for some Indian cricket promoters, he thought: &quot;They are hardly squeaky clean, to put it mildly.&quot;  But he understood how the mass market for cricket in India and, in particular, its appeal to the new middle class that advertisers want to woo, is flooding the Indian game with money and luring the world&apos;s best players to the subcontinent. To Gula&apos;s mind, it made sense for the ECB to try to hang on to the Test squad by offering them the alternative temptation of a piece of the Stanford action. I respected his opinion, but thought he was being too kind. The rise of a democratic India is one of the few optimistic developments in global politics.  In sport as in foreign policy, we would do well to stick with the better descendants of our empire while steering clear of, and making amends for, the gang of little hooligans we let loose on the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/letsgetcreative/how-good-brits", "sentences": ["In print advertising we were fifth (Germany 1, Singapore 2, France 3, Brazil 4), in poster advertising we were second (behind Germany) while in direct marketing we were sixth, in TV, second and in digital, third."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-23T00:01:00Z", "title": "Exactly how good are the Brits?", "tags": [], "article": "And the most creative country in the world last year was, cue drum roll, ... er, Germany? Perhaps it&apos;s just a measure of how efficient they are at entering creative awards, but according to The Big Won report, a register of results from 50 advertising and marketing award shows worldwide, Germany won more gold, silver and bronze prizes than any other country in 2008. For years we have blithely assumed that UK marketing communications lead the world, but we actually came third behind the US. In print advertising we were fifth (Germany 1, Singapore 2, France 3, Brazil 4), in poster advertising we were second (behind Germany) while in direct marketing we were sixth, in TV, second and in digital, third. So what&apos;s going on? Is the British marketing communications industry losing its mojo? &quot;Not at all,&quot; says Patrick Collister, the former advertising agency creative director behind The Big Won. &quot;A few years ago, the UK dominated the awards scene and now the rest of the world is catching up. They&apos;ve learned how we do it and now they are copying us like crazy.&quot; The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) points out that its Effectiveness Awards - historically a showcase for best practice - has been copied by eight other countries since it was launched 30 years ago. Mould-breaking ideasWhile we may no longer be the very best by miles, we are certainly near the top of the premier league of world creativity, argues Collister. And, perhaps more importantly, when it comes to cutting-edge creative thinking, Britain still rules. &quot;The fact is, mould-breaking ideas are still more likely to come from the UK than anywhere else,&quot; he says.  His view is confirmed by Sean Gogarty, global vice-president of brand development for soap giant Unilever&apos;s homecare division, selling in more than 120 countries. &quot;London still operates at a level above Europe and most of the rest of the world, excelling at creativity within a strategic context,&quot; he says. Probably the most significant creative development of the last few years has been the transformation of advertising into &quot;short-form entertainment,&quot; fusing technology and the virtual world with real life events - or what might be called &quot;reality advertising&quot;.  This complex fusion of conventional advertising, experiential marketing, and digital communications was pioneered by ad agency Fallon in London in its launch campaign for Sony&apos;s Bravia range. Fallon&apos;s Juan Cabral worked with Danish director Nicolai Fuglsig to film 250,000 multicoloured bouncy balls being shot into the air using special compressed-air cannons. The ad&apos;s evocative music sung by Jose Gonzalez immediately became a world bestseller. &quot;Tipping a quarter of a million balls down a hill in San Francisco was big news in the city,&quot; says Collister. &quot;Before the shoot was even over, people had posted their own films of it on the internet. The ad was edited and distributed virally [online] before it was ever broadcast. When it was broadcast, it was clear Sony Bravia didn&apos;t just have an ad - it had top-class entertainment.&quot; Compelling innovationUK agencies have embraced this free-thinking approach with real gusto. London-based digital agency Lean Mean Fighting Machine was voted interactive agency of the year at the Cannes advertising festival last June for its daring exploration of the boundaries of advertising and the internet. Last year, for instance, it ran a campaign to launch a new route flown by Emirates airline from the Middle East to South America by creating an ad that lasted, believe it or not, exactly as long as the flight: 14 hours and 20 minutes.  It also launched a new Samsung camera phone by getting photographer Nick Turpin to set up a website that allowed consumers to vote where he should be sent to next.  Another agency, AnalogFolk, was established with precisely this blend of digital and real world (or analog) in mind. &quot;People are willing to engage with brands in deeper and more meaningful ways than ever before,&quot; says founding partner Matt Hardisty. &quot;So we market brands by creating culture rather than simply reflecting it.&quot; So when the company was asked to launch a new London store by Japanese trainer manufacturer Asics, but within a relatively small budget, it needed a compelling idea to get Londoners to alter their behaviour. It opted for an event - using film, the internet and a window display. &quot;We challenged 2006 world triathlon champion Tim Bon to race against a London tube train, first over half a kilometre and then over five kilometres. We filmed the run from his point of view and distributed it through a website. We then invited people to complete the same course virtually by running on a treadmill in the shop window with an interactive version of the film playing,&quot; says Hardisty. So perhaps it&apos;s not quite advertising any more, but something else? Although we no longer dominate the world&apos;s ad awards, the UK still leads the world when it comes to pushing creative thinking to the max.

Global sales of games software reached $32bn last year, and other countries took one look at the figures and got their skates on, offering their own companies substantial subsidies. The most extreme example is Canada - which gives games developers salary subsidies of 37.5% and up to 40% R&amp;D tax credits. Now France, Singapore, various Scandinavian countries, South Korea and even two US states are offering salary subsidies. &quot;The industry is worth millions to us. It&apos;s something we&apos;re good at - like codebreaking or crosswords,&quot; says the new minister for culture, creative industries and tourism, Barbara Follett. Creatively, UK developers remain the equal of anyone: last year&apos;s Grand Theft Auto IV, developed at Rockstar North in Scotland, generated $500m in sales in its opening week, easily outselling any previous game or even film (Iron Man, launched that week, raked in $100m).  LittleBigPlanet, developed by ex-indie outfit Media Molecule in Guildford and published by the mighty Sony, was acclaimed as the most innovative game for many years. Industry guru Peter Molyneux, who employed Media Molecule&apos;s founders at his developer, Lionhead, provided Microsoft with one of its biggest-selling Xbox 360 games last year, Fable II. Yet collectively, UK developers have started slipping down the global pecking order: Canada took the number three slot in 2006, and South Korea is now poised to knock the UK down to fifth place. Support for small firmsIn this fast-moving industry, small innovative firms may be pioneering in entirely new markets. Frequently, the investment required is as great as that of a feature film, and times are hard. If these small outfits aren&apos;t to be tempted to sell out to overseas buyers, they need help. Tiga, the UK developers&apos; trade body, is now lobbying not for salary subsidies but for tax breaks, identical to those recently enjoyed by the UK film industry. So far, the government has resisted. But given recent events - notably billions of pounds sunk into the black hole formerly known as the financial sector - surely, the government should look first to assist industries that would respond rapidly to much smaller financial injections? Tiga chief executive Richard Wilson says: &quot;In these times, it&apos;s vital to invest, not put things on hold. We estimate that, over a five-year period, the tax-breaks we are asking for would cost the Treasury \u00a3150m. In that period the industry would generate 1,700 real jobs.&quot; Don Foster, shadow culture, media and sport secretary for the Liberal Democrats, echoes Wilson&apos;s sentiments: &quot;\u00a330m per year is a quarter of the money spent on the film industry in the form of tax breaks. The government should be looking at a series of small but targeted measures to help sectors like the games industry. In the medium term, creative industries that are properly supported could be the key drivers of the UK economy.&quot; So, are tax breaks likely to feature in the next budget? Wilson is optimistic: &quot;I&apos;m going to be meeting Treasury officials. I think the Department for Culture , Media and Sport (DCMS) is sympathetic.&quot;  Ian Livingstone, who as creative director and head of acquisitions at Eidos is a true industry heavyweight, is less sanguine: &quot;Perhaps one day, talk will translate into action, but in the meantime, [UK] studios will continue to close or to be sold to overseas buyers.&quot; Livingstone approves of the arrival of Barbara Follett at the DCMS: &quot;We are very optimistic that she will take action,&quot; he says. Follett herself seems aware of the issues, and confirms that she is in discussion with the Treasury, but adds: &quot;it&apos;s a slow process, and in this economic climate it is even slower.&quot; Unbelievably, given the rising unemployment figures, the UK games industry faces another problem: finding graduates with the right skills. Livingstone says: &quot;Only four out of 81 games courses in UK universities have been accredited by Skillset&quot; (the government sector skills council that deals with computer games as well as radio, TV and other disciplines such as publishing). &quot;The industry desperately needs computer science graduates, programmers, artists and animators. Unfortunately, universities&apos; easy option to get bums on seats is to offer a generalist course.&quot;  Wilson positively bristles with measures that could solve that problem, such as altering the national curriculum so that children under 16 could be taught computer programming; giving maths, science and IT teachers golden handshakes; and reducing tuition fees for undergraduates studying those subjects. There is a real sense of frustration in the UK games industry. The support it needs is tiny compared with that already given to the financial sector and motor manufacturing. Creative games could act as a beacon of hope in a post-recession UK economy. But the chances of a speedy collaboration between the DCMS and the Treasury are universally held to be remote.

There is a season to sow and a season to reap. Once a year the big harvest comes around and we look in the basket: how many students actually turned up, with what quality and paying how much? As on the farm, if you mess up at harvest time you have to wait another year to make amends. The global economic malaise was just seriously emerging last September, the traditional northern hemisphere harvest time in education. Most British universities scored a good harvest. With unemployment starting to rise there was a generally strong flow of British students. The already weakening pound made the country attractive for students from the EU and for many true &apos;internationals&apos; from further abroad. So, while so many other industries with shorter cycles are suffering much economic pain, universities are charging ahead reasonably unscathed. Students are asking more frequently for payment plans, and debtors are up, but income does not seem to be too radically affected. Not yet. It is only when we look in the basket at next harvest time that we shall have the first proper test of how recession-proof UK higher education actually is. Meanwhile, here, and around the world, there is much probing of entrails. What do last quarter&apos;s dramatic contraction of the Japanese economy and woeful trade statistics really mean for students from East Asia? Will China, the biggest source of international students, follow a similar trajectory between now and September? Will the dire economic state of a variety of our southern and eastern European partners, not to forget Ireland also, cause more EU students to stay at home in September? We can be assured of strong undergraduate demand from British students come September, so the speculation centres solidly on international student flows. At around 15% of the total UK university student population, many universities depend on these international students. And for some, particularly London institutions such as London Business School, London School of Economics, SOAS and City University, London, that percentage is much higher, and the dependency much higher. In some of these cases, international student revenues are a quarter, or more, of entire institutional income. Among the prodders of the international entrails there are the optimists and the pessimists. The half-glass-full people believe higher education is counter-cyclical. It makes hay while the economy suffers and sometimes suffers when the economy is buoyant. So, when unemployment grows people top up their qualifications or take refuge in a higher degree. Governments have even looked traditionally to universities to soak up what might otherwise be youth unemployment. Our optimists also believe that the combination of the high regard for British qualifications and a weak pound will bring international students in droves \u2013 and the first signs of applications for next year certainly do look promising. September 2009 could, then, be a bumper harvest, with many bargain-hunters at the gates. In the other corner are the pessimists. They warn that this recession is not like other recessions. This is not some technical correction, but rather a slowly moving tsunami. And, like a tsunami, it will sweep away much more in its wake than we expect. International students, and their families, will lose confidence to commit to three or four years of study abroad. They will take a wait-and-see approach if things go any further down. After all, if housing, jobs and food are at stake, post-compulsory education becomes a discretionary expenditure. As in the credit markets recently, things can just freeze up, however good the investment might be by any rational measure. What&apos;s more, warn the glass-half-empty people, September is still a long way away. Look at how much has changed just in the five months since Lehman Brothers collapsed. How will the pound fare over the next seven months? Will others \u2013 like the euro or the US dollar \u2013 weaken more than sterling in the coming months? After all, in January the pound appreciated by an unprecedented percentage against the euro, so these are volatile and unpredictable times. Week by week I see the pessimists slowly gaining ground, although there are occasional optimistic rallies often centred upon hopeful readings of the Chinese economy. One place to watch is Australia, as the southern hemisphere&apos;s annual harvest occurs in February/March. With over half a million international students (a quarter of them from China alone) in its education sector, Australia will be the first reliable test of full-year entry of international students inside the recession. Despite some eager reports in mid-January that many Asian students were deferring their Australian places, driven by real-estate reports rather than reliable educational data, it will only be in the coming weeks that we shall come to know whether this is just a tidal movement or the start of a global tsunami occurring down under. Now, you can thus far still be an optimist, but even so mess up on the UK harvest in September. The stumbling introduction of a points-based immigration scheme here plus this week&apos;s shock announcement of up to 50% increases in visa fees for international students can well dampen an already anxious market. After all, these students have many other options these days. The US, beset with loan problems for its domestic students, now looks more keenly than ever at attracting international students, and has overcome many of its homeland security excesses post-9/11. Germany is rapidly gaining popularity through greater subsidy of student fees and the teaching of more programmes in English. No longer is it a question of Birmingham or Brighton, but rather London or London Ontario, Manchester or Melbourne, Salford or Singapore. \u2022 Malcolm Gillies is vice-chancellor and president of City University, London"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/25/japan-economic-crisis-recession", "sentences": ["In South Korea, exports fell a record 33% in January from a year earlier, while Taiwan and Singapore reported falls of 43% and 35%."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-25T07:49:45Z", "title": "Export slump confirms Japanese economic crisis", "tags": ["Global recession", "Japan", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Japan&apos;s economic crisis deepened today after figures showed exports fell by a record 46% in January from a year earlier, leaving the country with a record trade deficit.

In addition to plunging demand in key export markets such as the US and Europe, Japan&apos;s plight was compounded by solid evidence of a slowdown in Asia. Exports to the continent were down 47%, while those to China fell 45%. &quot;Exports to Asia, particularly to China, are tumbling at about the same pace as shipments to the United States, signalling that even China&apos;s economy may be shrinking,&quot; said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute. &quot;We don&apos;t see any signs of a pickup in the Japanese economy in the near term.

Yesterday the whole insurance sector was under pressure on worries about capital levels, with Pru also undermined by talk it was in the bidding for the Asian businesses of struggling US rival AIG. Today they have recovered again, up 11p to 277.75p. And, strangely, this time it is on the prospect of a successful deal with AIG. Traders said Pru looked like one of only three remaining bidders before Friday&apos;s deadline (Canda&apos;s Manulife and Temasek of Singapore are reportedly the others). Any deal is set to involve the sale of a 49% stake in the $20bn Asian division, although AIG could still float the business off if the auction is not successful.

But they said sovereign wealth funds could help out with the financing:  &quot;As Prudential rather uniquely shares agency distribution and has the largest cost overlap with AIG, we think it is in a very competitive position to successfully bid at a decent price. We have seen estimates placing the price for 100% of AIA [the Asian business] at $15-20bn on around $1.7bn of profit, and we would guess this to be near book value. Although there has been talk in the market that the US government would rather warehouse AIA if no satisfactory price is offered, we believe it want to avoid doing this, as this is a people&apos;s business which could decay rapidly as competitors poached agents.  &quot;[Reports suggest] the Singapore government could be looking to get involved in a joint venture, which we thought could be the case. It is our guess, given the internal resources at the Prudential and the fact that even if AIA were purchased at book, there would be excess capital on the important IGD statutorybasis, that Prudential would need to raise \u00a34-6bn for this acquisition.We also believe that this will be oversubscribed as it is a rare &quot;good story&quot; in the current environment.  &quot;[The] swingfactor is the Chinese government. I would guess that Beijing would be cautious about letting a local insurance company or bank get involved given the lack of synergies and its experience with the Fortis/Ping An loss.

This column revealed last November that Arsenal were unlikely to succeed in repaying the \u00a3135m loan by April 2010 and Hill-Wood appeared to admit as much yesterday. &quot;We are at a preliminary stage of discussions with the banking syndicate about an appropriate extension,&quot; he said. &quot;In the current financial climate we do not expect these discussions to be concluded quickly, an increased cost is likely to be involved and there can be no certainty that a satisfactory agreement will be reached, but we believe that a positive outcome will be achieved in due course.&quot; The &quot;current financial climate&quot; has, of course, led to both RBS and Bank of Ireland being part-nationalised and far more circumspect about how they deal with their funds, leading to the many caveats in Hill-Wood&apos;s statement. But by no means is all lost for Arsenal. Even if they must meet an &quot;increased cost&quot; as part of the refinancing of the loan it would reduce the profits due from the development - previously anticipated to be in excess of \u00a350m - but would not be taken from the football business. The board has been keen to stress that it is &quot;ringfenced&quot; from funds available to Arsene Wenger and they could, in theory, walk away from the construction project, leaving the headache to the banks. There were a number of positives for Arsenal in the half-year accounts. Pre-tax profits had risen to \u00a324.5m after making \u00a344.4m from match-days. But one figure Arsenal fans might have been displeased to see was that for a second summer transfer window running theirs had become a selling club. In 2008 as in 2007, Wenger earned a net \u00a38m through his player trading."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/27/cititgroup-rescue-bailout", "sentences": ["The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, alongside the Saudi Arabian prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Capital Research Global Investors and Capital World Investors are among private investors to said they will participate in the exchange."], "publicationDate": "2009-02-27T14:02:00Z", "title": "Citigroup board shakeup after rescue deal", "tags": ["Citigroup", "US economy", "US news", "Global recession", "Business", "World news", "Banking"], "article": "Citigroup has struck a deal that will give the US government a stake of up to 36% in the bank, in return for a boardroom shakeup and a suspension of dividends. The government holds a 7% stake in the struggling bank. Under the deal, most of the bank&apos;s board will be replaced by independent directors, said Richard Parsons, Citigroup&apos;s chairman. Chief executive Vikram Pandit is expected to keep his job. It is the third time the treasury has come to Citi&apos;s rescue since mid-October, with the bank considered too big to be allowed to fail. Citi said the deal will not require additional taxpayer money \u2013 the government has invested $45bn (\u00a331bn) in Citi through two capital injections as part of its troubled asset relief programme. Under today&apos;s agreement, the government, along with other private investors, will convert some of their preferred stock in Citi to common shares. Citi has offered to exchange up to $27.5bn of preferred stock held by private investors at a conversion price of $3.25 a share, a 32% premium over Thursday&apos;s closing price of $2.46. The government will match up to $25bn of preferred stock it owns for conversion at the same price.

As part of the deal, Citi will suspend dividends on its common stock and preferred shares. The bank also said it took a goodwill impairment charge of about $9.6bn due to a deterioration in financial markets. The deal will boost Citi&apos;s capital ratios, a measure of its financial strength. Stuart Plesser at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s Equity Research said this week that converting the government&apos;s preferred equity stake into common stock &quot;would help boost the company&apos;s low tangible equity ratio (currently 1.5%), which we believe is too low given Citi&apos;s asset base&quot;.

After the government released plans to take what is in effect a controlling shareholding in the world&apos;s biggest banking group Citi shares plunged 39% to close at just $1.50. The rout contributed to a fall of 119 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, taking it to 7,062 points - a twelve-year low. The US government&apos;s move, made after days of speculation that Citi was to be nationalised, is the third attempt by the US Treasury to stabilise the troubled banking group and arrest the rapid decline in its share price. Previous government efforts to restore the bank&apos;s fortunes - including a $45bn (\u00a332bn) capital injection in exchange for preferred shares and a guarantee on more than $316bn worth of dodgy loans - did not restore the market&apos;s confidence. In the face of this continued failure, the US Treasury made its boldest move yet to save Citigroup an hour before Wall Street opened for trading yesterday. The government proposed converting to common equity some $25bn worth of the preferred shares it received in exchange for the earlier capital injections. The exchange will be made at $3.25-a-share - a 32% premium to Thursday&apos;s closing share price - and only if and when a group of private preferred stock holders agree to do the same. Those private investors, who hold some $27.5bn of preferred Citi stock between them, include long-time Citi backer Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. If the plan is fully executed the US government&apos;s stake in Citi would exceed 36% while existing shareholders would see their holding slump to just 26%. &quot;This securities exchange has one goal - to increase our tangible common equity,&quot; Citi chief executive Vikram Pandit said. Critics of the government intervention say the new plan is in effect a nationalisation of Citigroup, but Treasury and White House officials maintain that they want to avoid direct government ownership of private banking companies. Government intervention in Citi&apos;s day-to-day affairs is already apparent, however. As the government deal was announced, Dick Parsons, the Citi chairman, also announced plans to get rid of five of the board&apos;s 15 directors. It is understood that hiring a majority of so-called &quot;independent&quot; directors was a condition of the renewed government bail-out. Parsons said the new directors will be brought on board as &quot;soon as is feasible&quot; but it is understood that several prospective directors have turned down offered directorships in recent weeks. &quot;It is not exactly a job many people would want to take on in the current environment,&quot; said one Citi insider. Citi also suspended its 1-cent-a-share dividend last night as it boosted its already record losses for 2008 by a further $10bn to $27.7bn. In the coming weeks Citi, along with all other major US banks participating in the US government bail-out schemes, will be forced to endure a so-called &quot;stress test&quot; to see if it can survive further pressure.Anticipation of the results is only serving to further spook investors, however. The market&apos;s reaction to the latest Citi plan was a clear indicator that investors feel betrayed by Citi and the US government. &quot;Investors pretty much lose everything they had in Citi through this deal,&quot; said David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s in New York who owns a small number of Citi shares in a personal account. &quot;This deal is clearly good for the long-term survival of the bank and for its bondholders,&quot; Wyss added. &quot;The equity holders can complain but you have to say to a certain extent that this is what they are there for. They take a risk and invest, if it doesn&apos;t go well they lose.&quot; The cost of insuring Citigroup bonds over five years - a key measure of how creditworthy the company is - dropped dramatically as soon as the government deal was announced, showing bondholders are much more pleased with the deal that equity holders. &quot;Bondholders now have, almost, the full faith and credit of the US treasury behind them,&quot; Wyss said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/03/mens-magazine-arena-to-close", "sentences": ["International editions are published in Ukraine, Turkey, Denmark, Korea, Thailand and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-03T11:54:51Z", "title": "Men's monthly magazine Arena to cease printing after 22 years", "tags": ["Bauer", "Magazines", "Newspapers & magazines", "Consumer magazines", "Media", "Life and style", "UK news", "Media downturn"], "article": "Pioneering men&apos;s monthly magazine Arena is set to close after 22 years, putting up to 12 jobs at risk.

The sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, made the offer to Pakistani officials yesterday after the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore effectively ended their chances of hosting matches for the foreseeable future. Australia postponed their last tour of Pakistan, scheduled for 2008, until 2010 because of safety concerns. &quot;Pakistan has started the discussion about playing three Test matches at neutral venues in England in 2010,&quot; the Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young said. &quot;It&apos;s a work in progress, the PCB [Pakistan Cricket Board] is responsible for coming up with the arrangements, but in principle we&apos;ve been comfortable and talking with them.&quot; Any rescheduled matches in England would avoid clashes with the southern hemisphere&apos;s busy summer season and Young said there was also the bonus of both countries having large supporter groups in England. &quot;One of the downsides to neutral venues is quite often you don&apos;t get people turning up at the stadium because wherever you are, the locals don&apos;t have a home-team interest,&quot; he said. &quot;But part of the theory is that there are a significant number of expatriate Pakistanis who, with appropriate marketing, might be encouraged to attend these games. Pakistan would still have kind-of a de facto home-crowd advantage.&quot; A junior tennis tournament scheduled this month in Karachi, Pakistan, was called off by the International Tennis Federation. Luca Santilli, the ITF manager of junior tennis, said the attack in Lahore was not the only factor in postponing the 16-21 March tournament. &quot;It was more the general atmosphere in the country, the general security in the country,&quot; said Santilli, adding that no make-up date has been set. Most of the players signed up for the nonprofessional tournament are between the ages of 13 and 18 and come from Pakistan, but also included are others from the region, including Thailand, India, Hong Kong and Singapore. Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has warned of the damaging financial implications to cricket in the country following the attack. Inzamam fears the PCB could face a financial meltdown as foreign teams were unlikely to play their scheduled series in Pakistan. &quot;The attack on the Sri Lankans means we should brace ourselves for some tough times. I don&apos;t see any team coming to Pakistan for a long time now, which would affect the sources of income for the PCB,&quot; Inzamam said. New Zealand are the next team due to visit Pakistan later this year under the ICC future tours schedule, but the prospect of the series taking place appears remote. Inzamam pointed out that Pakistan was now almost certainly limited to just two options; to play home series at neutral venues or be content with taking part in overseas tours only. &quot;In both cases Pakistan board will not earn as much money as it would hosting teams,&quot;he noted. Pakistan are playing a one-day series against Australia at Dubai and Abu Dhabi in April and May after Ricky Ponting&apos;s team refused to tour because of security concerns while, last year, West Indies turned down an invitation for a Test series and the ICC has already moved the Champions Trophy from Pakistan due to security issues. Another former captain, Imran Khan, has also described the attack as a security failure on part of the government. &quot;This incident is very tragic for Pakistan sports and one of the worst security failures. Pakistan government had assured the Sri Lankans they would provide them proper security,&quot; Imran told a private television channel. Sri Lanka had been promised foolproof security he said and Tuesday&apos;s attack &quot;was a shameful security lapse&quot;, he told The Associated Press. &quot;Our interior ministry adviser has more security than what the Sri Lankans got. If it was any other country, government officials would have resigned by now, but no such sort of a thing happened here. &quot;To talk about the 2011 World Cup in Pakistan when it&apos;s warlike situation everywhere here \u2013 the security situation does not look good at all.&quot; Pakistan Cricket Board chief Ijaz Butt also questioned his own country&apos;s prospects for co-hosting the World Cup in 2011. &quot;How can we force them to play in Pakistan if the security situation doesn&apos;t improve,&quot; he asked. &quot;It has earned a bad name to Pakistan in international community,&quot; Butt said, adding that no country would contemplate touring unless the security situation improved considerably. &quot;It looks grim for at least 6-12 months.&quot; However he deflected questions about security, saying it was a government responsibility. &quot;Nowhere in the world the cricket board interferes in the security matters and it&apos;s the sole responsibility of the government,&quot; he said. &quot;As far as I know, the security level was the same as was in the past when various teams toured Pakistan.&quot; The International Cricket Council is reviewing plans for the 2011 World Cup, which is set to be co-hosted by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/04/liverpool-sponsorship-chief-executive-far-east", "sentences": ["The far east tour will take place from 17 to 26 July, and will involve matches in Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok, and given the club&apos;s appeal throughout the world, its fanbase stretching far and wide, the trip should prove to be a money-spinner."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-04T16:32:44Z", "title": "Premier League: Liverpool's potential chief executive Ian Ayre announces sponsorship plans", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Premier League", "Football", "Virgin Media", "Huddersfield", "Sport"], "article": "With the hunt for Rick Parry&apos;s replacement as Liverpool&apos;s chief executive continuing apace, one candidate, Ian Ayre, has unveiled plans for new sponsorship and elevating the club&apos;s place in football&apos;s rich list.

According to a Deloitte report released last month, Liverpool are the seventh-richest club in the world, with revenues of over \u00a3200m, rising one place higher from the year before, and Ayre says sponsorship gains procured in the past 12 months mean he &quot;would be shocked if we did not climb further&quot;.

Using the stolen information, a team of foreign hackers smuggled into the bank dispatched payment orders to every corner of the globe. Had the international gang succeeded in siphoning \u00a3229m out of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), they would have pulled off the largest robbery in British criminal history. The elaborate operation almost outwitted security systems on the Swift (Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) payments mechanism. But unfortunately for the gang, some of the electronic forms had been filled in incorrectly. The gang&apos;s international profile, involving separate teams specialising in hacking and money-laundering, highlights the growing sophistication of criminal enterprises targeting the City of London, according to the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca), which investigated the attempted robbery. Hugh Rodley, 61, was the driving force \u2013 if not the mastermind \u2013 behind the plot, the prosecution alleged. His original name was Hugh James McGeough. Having bought the title to a manor in Gloucestershire, he styled himself &quot;Lord Hugh Rodley&quot;. According to prosecutors, he travelled to Dubai and the Seychelles to establish offshore accounts, faxed a forged authorisation order for \u20ac12m from a corner shop in Cheltenham, and flew out to Las Palmas after the raid in an attempt to shuffle the loot around foreign banks. Rodley, who declined to give evidence during the trial, insisted he was a legitimate businessman. His accomplices gave evidence that he tried to distance himself from companies established to receive the stolen cash. Both of the hackers hired from Belgium \u2013 Jan Van Osselaer, 32, and Gilles Poelvoorde, 35 \u2013 and the man on the inside of the bank, Kevin O&apos;Donoghue, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal. O&apos;Donoghue, 34, from Birmingham, was SMBC&apos;s security supervisor. He arranged for the hackers to sneak into the bank, disabling CCTV cameras and even cutting wires. On three occasions at night in September 2004, they installed key-logging software on the bank&apos;s computers that recorded the keystrokes used by commercial and private customers when they entered their passwords and log-ins. On the evening of Friday 1 October, they entered the building again and sent money transfer orders via the Swift payments system. The first set of 10 messages should have sent heaps of cash around accounts in Spain, Dubai, Hong Kong, Turkey and Israel. When it became clear the following day that none of the transfers had gone through \u2013 due to an error filling in the Swift forms \u2013 the hackers entered the next night and sent out even larger orders, emptying accounts owned by companies such as Toshiba International, Nomura Asset Management and Sumitomo Chemical UK. The largest single transfer was for \u00a341m sent to Dubai. Other payments were supposed to end up in Liechtenstein and Singapore. When the break-in and attempted theft were spotted on the Monday, the police were contacted immediately. The hackers and O&apos;Donoghue were the first to be identified \u2013 the CCTV tapes had not been totally wiped and their late-night entry into the bank was discovered. Poelvoorde, already serving five years for fraud in Belgium, was carrying a false passport when arrested. Osselaer, it later emerged, had a computer science degree. Both Rodley and his long-term business partner, Bernard Davies, 74, were charged with conspiracy to steal, defraud, transfer criminal property and remove criminal property from the UK. Davies pleaded not guilty. On the night of 16 January he killed himself at his flat in central London. A letter sent by Davies to the police explained: &quot;Rodley has tried very hard to get Nash [another defendant] to change his story over the Cheltenham fax \u2026 I&apos;m very tired and have lost the will to fight.&quot; David Nash, also known as David Coyne, had a long criminal record of deception and drug dealing. The owner of a Soho sex shop, he claimed he had been tricked into fronting a company to receive millions of pounds from the SMBC bank scam. Nash, 47, from Durrington, West Sussex, denied knowing what was happening. &quot;I am streetwise,&quot; he admitted at Snaresbrook crown court, &quot;but that doesn&apos;t go into defrauding Japanese banks. The plans were idiotic.&quot; Had the raid succeeded it would have been more than four times larger than the previous record UK bank robbery: \u00a353m taken from a Securitas depot in Kent in 2006. Others were arrested as part of the Soca inquiry. No one else has yet been charged. &quot;More people are coming forward now and reporting such crimes,&quot; said Sharon Lemon, the deputy director of ecrime at Soca. Often we find out that [the different teams] in these raids have never met each other. In this case they bodged what they were trying to do.&quot; The same gang is thought to have targeted other banks in the UK and abroad.

The current crisis is serious for most of the world: the IMF is projecting world economic growth of just 0.5% this year \u2013 the worst since the second world war \u2013 and this number could easily be revised downward.  In the United States, one of the first casualties of the current recession was the extreme fiscal conservatism that has plagued the country for decades. It seems like ages since the Clinton administration, facing projected budget surpluses of more than $5tn, decided that it needed to pay off the entire national debt before committing to any new social spending. President Barack Obama&apos;s proposed budget has a deficit for this year of 12.3% of GDP \u2013 twice the size (relative to the economy) of the next largest deficit in the six decades since the second world war. (That was Ronald Reagan&apos;s &quot;military Keynesian&quot; budget of 1983.) Like his successor George W Bush, Reagan never admitted that deficit spending was needed to pull the economy out of recession. Instead he pretended that he was just meeting &quot;defence needs&quot; and granting tax cuts where tax cuts were due (mostly to the wealthy). Today there is a pretty sizeable consensus that deficit spending is very necessary, whatever the Republican leadership may think \u2013 if they are thinking at all. This is really just a matter of national income accounting. With consumption and investment falling, that leaves only government purchases and net exports to pull us out of this recession. More on net exports (exports minus imports) in a minute \u2013 but for now this part of our economy is not set to grow enough to pull us out of the recession. Hence the need for the government to step in, in a big way. Of course, this could be just a temporary change in thinking, with desperation focusing the mind. But there are some signs that it may persist. For example, the New York Times reported on Sunday that Obama&apos;s projected budget deficit for 2013 is &quot;3% of the overall economy, a level that economists consider sustainable&quot;. Indeed this is true, and the arithmetic is simple: If the debt grows at the same rate or slower than the GDP (in nominal terms) it will not grow as a percentage of the economy. That is what matters, not the absolute size of the public debt \u2013 a big scary number ($10.9tn) that is often thrown around by conservatives. As evident as this is, the major media have almost never looked at the problem in this way before. Another long-held belief that is currently being challenged in practice but needs to be rethought is the extent to which the government can finance a fiscal stimulus through money creation, rather than by traditional borrowing. The conventional wisdom is that this would dangerously increase inflation. But inflation is falling in most of the world, and in the US, prices are actually dropping. The US consumer price index fell at an annual rate of 8.4% over the last quarter. Even the core index (excluding food and energy) was up by only 0.9% over the quarter, and the rate of inflation has been declining. The US government has already financed at least $1.2tn of borrowing during this crisis by creating money, which was added to the Fed&apos;s balance sheet. This technically adds to the national debt, but since the government owes the money to itself, there is no net outflow of interest payments from the government on this debt. This reduces the long-term debt burden of the necessary stimulus. Clearly there are circumstances under which this &quot;monetising&quot; of some additional borrowing makes sense because the threat of increasing inflation is minimal. The present economic free-fall seems to be such a circumstance. This has international implications as well. The Obama administration has proposed scaling back at least some foreign aid. Of course, much of our foreign aid is military aid that is often destructive. But it would be a shame to cut back on such life-saving aid that goes to fight Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases that plague the poorest counties \u2013 when this funding needs more than ever to be greatly expanded. On a larger scale, since the dollar has a special status as the world&apos;s reserve currency, the United States could conceivably contribute to the world economic recovery by providing dollars to help developing countries through the international credit crunch and world recession. Our government has done a little bit of this: eg, it created an international currency swap arrangement of $30bn each for Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Singapore, which added to the hard currency reserves that these countries could tap if necessary. But many countries are not adopting the expansionary macroeconomic policies that they \u2013 and the world \u2013 need, for fear of running short of foreign exchange. In other words, the United States \u2013 because of the special position of the dollar \u2013 could to some extent play the role of a world central bank in the present world recession. This would help stimulate our own economic growth as well by increasing demand for US exports. Of course, if the dollar were to lose value internationally in the process (because of the increased supply of dollars worldwide), this would be an added gain for the US economy.  That is because the US dollar is overvalued, and this overvaluation has artificially stimulated our imports and reduced our exports for many years. The idea that the United States needs a &quot;strong dollar&quot; could be the next widely held economic misconception to bend to reality."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/06/notorious-rogue-traders", "sentences": ["Barings Bank \u2013 \u00a3827m Although only losing a quarter as much money as Kerviel, Nick Leeson is still the most famous &quot;rogue trader&quot; in history Leeson spent almost four years in prison in Singapore before being released in 1999, after bringing down one of the grandest names in British banking.", "Working in Barings&apos; Singapore office, Leeson dealt in the complex world of derivatives and futures."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-06T17:00:31Z", "title": "A rogues' gallery of traders", "tags": ["Merrill Lynch", "Banking", "Business", "Credit crunch"], "article": "Merrill Lynch&apos;s admission today that it is investigating &quot;irregularities&quot; in its London trading positions has revived interest in that notorious City figure, the rogue trader.

J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel was promptly arrested, but it could be another year before any charges are brought. Kerviel was accused of hacking into SocGen&apos;s computer systems to circumvent its internal controls, letting him to run up positions worth \u20ac50bn. The Frenchman, though, has refused to become a scapegoat, claiming that other bank employees are also responsible for its huge loss. An internal inquiry has cast doubt on claims that he acted alone. The scandal turned Kerviel into a 21st-century celebrity, complete with a web-based fan club, branded T-shirts and mugs, and even supportive videos on YouYube.

Working in Barings&apos; Singapore office, Leeson dealt in the complex world of derivatives and futures. He was seen as a rising star at the venerable City institution, racking up large profits. But his world fell apart after he began hiding his bad trades in a secret account. These losses grew over several years, forcing him into increasingly desperate but unsuccessful attempts to make the money back. Leeson finally fled in February 1995 after a bet that the Tokyo stockmarket would rise went badly wrong, but was arrested at Frankfurt airport. Barings was later sold to the Dutch banking giant ING for just \u00a31. In the aftermath, Leeson&apos;s managers were criticised for allowing him to settle his own trades \u2013 and thus the opportunity to disguise his actions. When not giving conference and after-dinner speeches, Leeson runs Galway United football club. Allied Irish Bank \u2013 \u00a3697m John Rusnak was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after the Baltimore-based trader ran up trading losses of almost $700m (\u00a3355m). The &quot;regular guy&quot; worked for Allfirst Financial, a division of Allied Irish Bank, dealing on foreign exchanges. Rusnak mainly traded the Japanese yen, running up losses that he hid using fictitious options contracts. Rusnak started concealing his losses in 1997 but was not uncovered until 2002 \u2013 even though some companies already refused to do business with him. By that stage, rather than sticking to his trading limit of $2.5m, Rusnak had secretly bet $7.5bn of AIB&apos;s money on the yen rising against the dollar. At his trial, prosecutors said the false trades had allowed Rusnak to keep receiving salaries and bonuses Daiwa Bank \u2013 $1.1bn Toshihide Iguchi, a senior US executive at Japan&apos;s Daiwa Bank, was imprisoned for four years and fined $2.6m (\u00a31.7m) in 1996 after losing $1.1bn through a decade of unauthorised bond trading. Iguchi confessed in a letter to the bank&apos;s president. Deficiencies in Daiwa&apos;s internal systems allowed him to conceal his losses for 11 years while he tried to trade his way back to profit \u2013 eventually falsifying 30,000 trading slips. In court, he said his life was filled with guilt, fear and deception but in a later interview in prison, Iguchi said he had seen his earlier actions as merely a violation of internal rules. &quot;I think all traders have a tendency to fall into the same trap. You always have a way of recovering the loss,&quot; he told Time magazine. The scandal cost Daiwa dearly. On top of Iguchi&apos;s losses, the bank was forced to stop operating in the US. Sumitomo Corporation \u2013 $2.6bn Yasuo Hamanaka, the chief copper trader at Sumitomo, was dubbed &quot;Mr Five Percent&quot; in recognition of his dominance of the global copper market. But in 1997 he was imprisoned for eight years for fraud and forgery. Hamanaka used off-the-book trades to manipulate the copper market and push prices up. He generated large profits for years but Sumitomo lost $2.6bn when the scandal was eventually uncovered.

Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt. Although governments may try to cram public debt down the throats of local savers (by using, for example, their rising influence over banks to force them to hold a disproportionate quantity of government paper), they will eventually find themselves having to pay much higher interest rates as well. Within a couple years, interest rates on long-term US Treasury notes could easily rise 3 to 4%, with interest rates on other governments&apos; paper rising as much, or more. Interest rates will rise to compensate investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolios and for an increasing risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away the value of their debts, or even default. In research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises, we find that public debt typically doubles, even adjusting for inflation, in the three years following a crisis. Many nations, large and small, are now well on their way toward meeting this projection. China&apos;s government has clearly indicated that it will use any means necessary to backstop growth in the face of a free-fall in exports. The Chinese have $2tn in hard currency reserves to back up their promise. President Barack Obama&apos;s new budget calls for a stunning $1.75tn deficit in the United States, a multiple of the previous record. Even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal orgy are seeing their surpluses collapse and their deficits soar, mainly in the face of falling tax revenues. Indeed, few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections, typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios. Unfortunately, in 2009, the global economy will not be a bed of roses. Income in the US and euro area both appear to have declined at an annualised rate of roughly 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Japan&apos;s GDP fell at perhaps twice that rate. China&apos;s claim that its GDP grew at a 6% rate during the end of last year is suspect. Exports have collapsed throughout Asia, including Korea, Japan and Singapore. Arguably India, and to a lesser extent Brazil, have been holding out a bit better. But few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can withstand a sustained collapse in the developed economies, much less serve as substitute engines of global growth. With the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small- and medium-size businesses to obtain even the minimal level of financing necessary to maintain inventories and conduct trade, global GDP is on a precipice in 2009. There is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contraction since World War II. In all likelihood, a slew of countries will see output declines of 4 to 5% in 2009, with some having true depression-level drops of 10% or more. Worse yet, unless financial systems spring back, growth could disappoint for years to come, especially in &quot;ground zero&quot; countries such as the United States, Britain, Ireland and Spain. US long-term growth could be particularly dismal, as the Obama administration steers the country toward more European levels of welfare assistance and income redistribution. Countries with European-style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60% of GDP when interest rates were low. But with debts in many countries rising to 80% or 90% of GDP, and with today&apos;s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon, trouble is brewing. Many of the countries that are piling on massive quantities of debt to bail out their banks have only tepid medium-term growth prospects, raising real questions of solvency and sustainability Italy, for example, with a debt-to-income ratio already exceeding 100%, has been able to manage so far thanks to falling global rates. But as debts mount, and global interest rates rise, investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt restructuring. Other countries such as Ireland, Britain, and the US started with a much stronger fiscal position, but may not be much better off when the smoke clears. Exchange rates are another wild card. Asian central banks are still nervously clinging to the dollar. But with the US printing money like it is going out of style, it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road \u2013 if the euro is still around, that is. As debt mounts and the recession lingers, we are surely going to see a number of governments try to lighten their load through financial repression, higher inflation, partial default or combinations of all three. Unfortunately, the endgame to the great recession of the 2000s will not be a pretty picture.

Sands says: &quot;Pay structures played a role, but to see them as a primary or sole cause of the crisis is a mistake. Things are more complex.&quot; His remarks come in the wake of the furore over rewards for failure in the banking industry and the \u00a3703,000-a-year pension awarded to Sir Fred Goodwin, the former head of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that has been bailed out by the taxpayer. Sands says that while banks and bankers should acknowledge that mistakes were made, many executives lost out in the crash because shares in their own banks collapsed as panic swept the markets. &quot;Dick Fuld [head of failed Lehman Brothers] reinvested his money in the bank&apos;s shares, but that didn&apos;t help him in the end,&quot; says Sands. He acknowledges that excessive leverage by the banks was a big factor in causing the credit crunch, but that other things, such as inadequate regulation and poor oversight, shouldn&apos;t be ignored.  &quot;With huge amounts of liquidity building up in the system during the good years, it was perhaps inevitable that we were storing up problems,&quot; he adds. Sands was one of the few banking executives that the government turned to for advice, when it became clear last year that only a huge public bailout of banks would avert a meltdown. Standard, with its main operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, has avoided the sub-prime debacle and last week reported record annual figures.  On regulation, Sands says: &quot;[Regulators] focused too much on individual institutions, rather than inherent, systemic risk. Basel Two [new banking standards introduced in 2004], had its merits, but concentrated too much on capital rather than liquidity; what kills banks is a lack of liquidity.&quot; Although his bank had little exposure to the housing crash that has brought down HBOS, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock in the UK, and countless other institutions in the US, not everything is rosy. Standard&apos;s strong headline profits mask contrasting numbers elsewhere: for instance, bad-debt provisions nearly doubled to $1.32bn in 2008, and Sands admits that life is about to get harder as the Asian export slump brings hardship to corporate customers. &quot;I don&apos;t want to gloss over the challenging economic backdrop,&quot; he says. Last year, Standard launched a \u00a31.8bn rights issue to bolster its balance sheet and hasn&apos;t been entirely unscathed by the turmoil: it took a $116m hit on its Whistlejacket structured investment vehicle in 2007, which was put into receivership a year ago. With its focus on emerging markets, Standard has reaped the benefits of the Asian economic boom that has been driven by spectacular growth in China and, to a lesser extent, India. With operations across the continent, Standard has developed relationships with business people, politicians and officials, that have &quot;stood us in good stead when it comes to managing risk,&quot; says Sands. &quot;Banks get into trouble when they do things they and their customers don&apos;t understand.&quot; But what does the future hold for western banking, when many of Standard&apos;s competitors are now owned by the state? Sands say he doesn&apos;t know, &quot;but I would think that the landscape will change irretrievably. How it will work is pretty uncertain, really&quot;. Standard, meanwhile, is benefitting from the disruption that is affecting rivals, gaining market share as institutions such as Citigroup and AIG, which have been rescued by the US government, come under pressure to reduce their operations overseas and focus instead on their home markets. &quot;Their distractions present an opportunity for us; the competition, in many cases, simply isn&apos;t there.&quot;  A former McKinsey consultant, who previously served as the bank&apos;s finance director, Sands spends half his working life travelling to the far-flung outposts of Standard&apos;s empire, from Taiwan to Seoul, then on to Beijing, Mumbai or South Africa. His parents were born in Asia, so he professes an affinity with the continent, and says he loves jetting around the globe. Now 47, he was educated at a south London comprehensive school, an international school in Canada, then Oxford and Harvard. Sands was headhunted by current chairman Mervyn Davies when he was at McKinsey and Standard was a client. Until the financial crisis, Standard was frequently the target of bid speculation, but Sands says he hardly gave such stories a second&apos;s thought. Temasek, the Singapore government&apos;s wealth fund, is the bank&apos;s biggest shareholder with 19%, but Sands is reluctant to answer a question about whether the fund could increase its stake, or launch a bid. &quot;You&apos;ll have to ask them,&quot; he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/mar/08/jiyai-shin-golf-womens-tournament", "sentences": ["The British Women&apos;s Open champion Jiyai Shin secured a superb two-stroke victory over Australia&apos;s Katherine Hull in the HSBC Women&apos;s Champions tournament in Singapore today."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-08T10:56:37Z", "title": "Golf: Jiyai Shin shines to win HSBC Women's Champions tournament in Singapore", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The British Women&apos;s Open champion Jiyai Shin secured a superb two-stroke victory over Australia&apos;s Katherine Hull in the HSBC Women&apos;s Champions tournament in Singapore today.

In doing so, it became the catalyst not only for building European unity, but also for creating the prosperity that marked Europe&apos;s post-war decades \u2013 a prosperity now under threat because of the global financial and economic crisis. If we are to see a stronger Europe emerge from today&apos;s challenges, visionary French leadership is needed again. The first moment when decisive French leadership began to unify Europe came when Robert Schumann and Konrad Adenauer created the European Coal and Steel Community. By rooting the then West Germany in the political, economic, and social fabric of the west, that step heralded the start of Germany&apos;s rebirth and economic miracle. The second time that France consolidated Europe&apos;s internal architecture came in 1983, during the debates over the stationing of American cruise and Pershing missiles in Germany to counter the deployment of SS20 missiles by the Soviet Union. France&apos;s resolve to stand with Germany helped prevent it from drifting into a dangerous neutrality that would have shaken the European community to its core. The third moment came after the Berlin Wall fell, and it was feared that an enlarged Germany might destabilise Europe. After initially trying to delay reunification, France embraced it, in exchange for Germany&apos;s reaffirming its commitment to European unity and Franco-German leadership of the European community. As a result, Germany bound itself to the idea of &quot;ever closer union&quot; even more definitively by pledging to join the common European currency, the euro. It is now urgent that the insights that have animated Franco-German relations be applied to all of central and eastern Europe. Only by securing the European identity of this entire region, and by anchoring the growing Russo-German relationship in a European context, can the European Union continue on its path of stability and prosperity. Only by reinforcing open trading and financial relations across Europe can we hope to subdue today&apos;s crisis. For it is in no European country&apos;s interest, or in the interest of the EU as a whole, that central and eastern Europe feel that they have been cast adrift or that Germany and Russia fixate on each other in this time of crisis. As with Germany in the 1950s, the nature of Russia&apos;s links with its immediate neighbours is turning out to be the defining factor in shaping the country&apos;s international image. Many observers regard these relations as a signal not just to the region, but to the rest of the world, of the sort of power that Russia wishes to be. The issue is partly one of &quot;internationalism&quot; itself. In contrast to Europe \u2013 with its close-knit network of multilateral organisations through which states formulate and conduct much of their foreign policies \u2013 Russia is not accustomed to intensively co-operative international procedures. But keeping Russia at arm&apos;s length from Europe has only strengthened the sense of isolation that many Russians feel, tempting them to define the country&apos;s interests in ways that are irreconcilable with those of Europe. It has also heightened Russia&apos;s desire to construct a special, bilateral Russo-German relationship, heedless of the context of the EU. European history during the past 60 years makes clear that the most promising approach to meeting the challenge of national reconciliation and stability is not to focus on specific contingencies, but to establish procedures that encourage orderly change. A singular vision has always animated this process: animosity between neighbours must not be allowed to fester, and the rule of law must reign not just within countries, but also between them. To believe that such a vision can work for Russia, Ukraine and Europe is not wishful thinking, but rests on the successful experience of France and Germany in promoting amity. Indeed, the existence or absence of a framework of cooperation often determines whether a dispute mutates into a crisis. Such co-operative frameworks seek to reconcile national independence with regional interdependence, focusing political leaders&apos; minds on prosperity for their people rather than on gaining unilateral advantages that ultimately impoverish and unsettle everyone. The first lesson of European unity is that times of crisis must draw the continent closer together, not divide it through protectionism, competitive devaluations, and expulsions of immigrants. Similarly, the euro must not be allowed to become an iron curtain that consigns non-members to a high-risk zone where investors dare not venture. For Ukraine, Europe can help by embracing the free-trade agreement that we are now negotiating. Coupled with our successful membership in the World Trade Organisation, Ukraine would stand to benefit when world and European trade begins to recover. Europe can also consider using various stabilisation funds to help our economy through the crisis that we are all enduring. I do not ask for these things out of a narrow concern for my country&apos;s health. Just as the US Federal Reserve has engaged in credit and currency swaps with Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea and other countries to ease their access to the dollars they need, the European Central Bank must offer such swap arrangements to Europe&apos;s non-euro countries in order for trade and production processes to continue. Yes, these are dark times, and all politicians want to protect their voters. But Europe&apos;s greatest postwar leaders understood that keeping the wider view of Europe in mind is the best way to achieve this goal. As at so many times before, now \u2013 with all of our economies in peril \u2013 is a moment for decisive French leadership.

What is different today is that it is emanating from China and India, rather than from the conventional bastions of capitalist prowess. Devi Shetty, a celebrated cardiac surgeon in Bangalore, brings health relief to India&apos;s masses through his Narayana group of hospitals. Some years ago, I witnessed his early experiments with rural telemedicine (where proceedures are carried out using phone or internet communication between professionals), especially in the Indian states of Karnataka and West Bengal. In my visit last month, the wall was adorned by a large map of Karnataka festooned with coloured pins, to indicate that he now served most district capitals in the remotest parts of the state. Moreover, a world map showed outreach to rural areas of east Africa and southeast Asia, and the room has been upgraded to reflect a still-expanding global reach. All this comes from carefully acquired experience \u2013 technical and sociological \u2013 with delivering expert medical advice through teleconference facilities, aided by satellite links. Shetty&apos;s team has successfully participated in telemedicine consultations \u2013 multi-specialty, non-stop availability, and supplemented by continuing education \u2013 with hospitals in 14 African countries. This effort is part of India&apos;s then President APJ Abdul Kalam&apos;s ambitious pan-African e-network project to link all 53 African capitals to tertiary care facilities across India. Shetty is a healer, first and foremost. But he is also an entrepreneur, and this is the latest in his many efforts to create successful, low-cost, but cutting-edge medical ecosystems in tough locations worldwide. He aspires audaciously to what he calls the universal Walmartisation of healthcare \u2013 a reshaping of medical care that the world&apos;s indigent need, and in Africa more than most other locations. Cynics say that India&apos;s e-network is currying favour with Africa in exchange for natural resources. Perhaps. But in that effort, India must contend with its neighbour, China, which speaks with a louder voice and carries a larger stick. China&apos;s President Hu Jintao&apos;s peripatetic diplomacy across Africa has ensured that the Chinese are omnipresent there. China has traded much investment in physical infrastructure in places otherwise shunned \u2013 Angola, Sudan and Zimbabwe \u2013 for access to natural resources. Witness also an unprecedented convening of 48 African heads of state and senior officials in Beijing in 2006 to signal unequivocally that China would speak with the loudest voice. India tried to mimic the event with an India-Africa summit in New Delhi in 2008. Fourteen countries attended to discuss food-price inflation, energy needs, and so on. Alas, India&apos;s voice was drowned out, not by China&apos;s attempts to provide medicine and education to Africa, but by the sheer magnitude of Chinese state-owned enterprises&apos; investments in physical infrastructure. But loud voices need not be the most effective. Indian influence will no doubt exploit assets less available to others, particularly the Indian diaspora in countries like South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. India and Africa have been linked over the centuries by trade, religion, and post-imperial political consciousness. Gandhi and the Non-Aligned Movement remain important symbols. Indians are more part of Africa&apos;s social tapestry than are the Chinese, a fabric that has been strengthened through opportunity and adversity through the ages. Consider Olam, a Singapore-headquartered but Africa-centric global agribusiness company. From the soybean farms of Brazil&apos;s Matto Grosso to the granaries of Ukraine, Olam is prized for its ability to add value in disparate conditions. Olam was started by Indians in Nigeria and remains a world-beating trader in cotton, coffee, cashews and the like. To succeed, Olam has had to work &quot;up country&quot; \u2013 a euphemism for difficult conditions far from comfortable port cities \u2013 requiring it to rely on Indians&apos; familiarity with, and willingness to work in, Africa&apos;s interior. Indeed, so competent is Olam that when Wilmar, a Southeast Asian firm run by overseas Chinese and a force in its own right in China and across Asia, sought to expand in Africa, it sought out Olam in a joint venture. The connection between Nigerian cashew farmers and Devi Shetty&apos;s pediatric cardiac surgery is that they both represent decentralised private activity, undertaken through the market, unlike the operations of the China National Petroleum Corporation, Sinopec, in Darfur. They all add value, but decentralised, market-based activity appears likelier to engender additional goodwill. But there is more reshaping to come, again fostered by mutual self-interest rather than by fiat. The Olam and Wilmar joint venture is, in a sense, symptomatic of the combination of assets from across Asia that can catalyse productive change in Africa. It is fitting that Olam, in Hebrew, means &quot;transcending boundaries&quot;. Such symbiosis requires a healthy disregard for convention. Failures will result, surely. But, to my mind, for the most part, decentralised experimentation beats Africa&apos;s partial addiction to aid.

He wrote about his experiences in his book, River Kwai Yasumee Nai (1994).  He was born in the Northampton-shire village of Little Harrowden, where he went to the local primary school. He lived for most of his life there, or in nearby Wellingborough, where he attended Park Street school. His formal education ended when he was 14, and though he was a sportsman of promise, the outbreak of the second world war ended a potential career as a professional footballer. He had played for Exeter reserves against an Arsenal side that included Denis Compton. Len joined the Royal Artillery but was captured by the Japanese in Singapore. He then spent more than three years in captivity, enduring the privations, hardship and risks inherent in being a PoW in the far east. Within weeks of his return home he wrote a note describing his experiences, which sat unread for more than 40 years and narrowly escaped being used to start a fire. With the assistance of his nephew, David, Len&apos;s recollections were published in 1994.  The resulting work is a tribute to his indomitable spirit, modesty and sense of humour. In the preface he wrote: &quot;It is not my intention to promote racial hatred in this narrative, as I believe that hatred only contributes to conflict.&quot; He was one of a small number of veterans interviewed for a BBC Timewatch documentary about the construction of the Burma railway. After the war, Len took up work in the shoe trade, in which he remained until his retirement. His prewar engagement to Marjorie turned into marriage soon after his return.  He suffered some health problems related to his years in captivity, but his natural fitness seemed to return, and when I first met him he was a spry octogenarian. However, he developed a respiratory illness last year from which he never properly recovered. Observing the patient and uncomplaining way with which he coped with this illness gave a real insight into the character and spirit that had carried him through his captivity. Marjorie survives him. \u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 15 March 2009. We previously referred to the late Len Toseland as Leo Toseland.

It emerged today that a Delta Airlines flight avoided disaster in November after encountering the same problems that forced a British Airways Boeing 777 to crash-land at Heathrow airport on 17 January. Peter Burkill, the pilot, was hailed as a hero after steering flight BA38 into Heathrow after losing power in both engines on approach. Thirteen passengers were injured but there were no fatalities among the 152 people on board. The Delta aeroplane, travelling from Shanghai to Atlanta, was flying over Montana on 26 November when it experienced a sudden &quot;rollback&quot;, or decrease in power, in its righthand engine due to fuel icing. The pilots restored power using safety instructions issued by Boeing after the Heathrow crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US has warned there is a &quot;high probability&quot; of it happening again. This afternoon its UK counterpart, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, called for a probe into fuel icing after warning that industry guidance on the problem was based on 50-year-old research. British Airways has 15 out of the 220 Boeing 777-200 planes worldwide that use the engine, known as the Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800. &quot;With two of these rollback events occurring within a year, we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again,&quot; said the NTSB acting chairman, Mark Rosenker. Rolls-Royce has said it expects to have a redesigned engine component ready within 12 months. Rosenker said: &quot;We are encouraged to see that Rolls-Royce is already working on a redesign.&quot; The AAIB report, which followed the NTSB&apos;s urgent safety recommendation, makes five recommendations, including: \u2022 A study into using anti-icing liquids in fuel for passenger aircraft. \u2022 An investigation by US and EU authorities into why ice forms in aviation fuel. \u2022 A probe by the same bodies into why ice forms in the planes&apos; fuel systems. In a second interim report into the Heathrow crash published this afternoon, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said &quot;soft ice&quot; had accumulated in the pipes that feed fuel into the aircraft engines. The ice, possibly formed as the plane flew in low temperatures over Siberia, could have been dislodged as the pilots sought an increase in thrust shortly before landing. Turbulence, shift in the pitch of the aircraft and temperature changes in engine components were also singled out as possible contributors. The AAIB said it was possible that the ice was then flushed into the fuel oil heat exchanger, which warms plane fuel before it is injected into the engines, and subsequently blocked the plane&apos;s fuel supply just as it required more thrust to land. Anti-icing additives are used in fuel by the military and some business jet operators. The AAIB asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US and the European Aviation Safety Agency to carry out the tests. &quot;Much of the current industry guidance is based on research undertaken over 50 years ago and since that time civil aircraft have become larger, fly for longer periods and incorporate new technology and materials. &quot;In order to improve guidelines for the design and testing of aircraft fuel systems it will be necessary for the aviation industry, led by the regulatory authorities, to undertake a number of co\u2011ordinated research projects.&quot; A Rolls-Royce spokesman said the AAIB report on the BA accident clearly stated that the Rolls-Royce equipment met or exceeded all requirements. &quot;The report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build-up in commercial &apos;long-cold-high&apos; routes. This is an industry-wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements.&quot; A spokesperson for British Airways said: &quot;We will work closely with the relevant authorities and will comply with requirements issued to all operators of Boeing 777s powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines.&quot; Boeing 777s used by major airlines American Airlines 47 Singapore Airlines 45 Cathay Pacific 17 BA 15 Malaysia Airlines 15 Thai Airways 14 Emirates 9 Delta 8 BOC Aviation (Asian leasing company) 6 El Al 6 Air New Zealand 4 Kenya Airways 4"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/mar/13/late-offers-budget-holidays-flights", "sentences": ["Other bargains include, Perth and Hong Kong direct \u00a3335; Bangkok direct \u00a3399; Singapore direct \u00a3399."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-13T12:59:36Z", "title": "Bargain travel deals of the day", "tags": ["Late offers", "Budget travel", "Cheap flights", "Travel"], "article": "Flights Sydney or Auckland from \u00a3499rtn: This is one of a number of long-haul deals from Trailfinders.

The long struggle to persuade the Swiss to abandon their banking secrecy is not yet over. There is still plenty of room for foot-dragging and hair-splitting and it is likely to be several years before any information is actually exchanged. But today was important. In accepting the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&apos;s (OECD) principles for the exchange of information on tax, the Swiss finally abandoned their insistence on a single, all-important legal point: that tax evasion is not a crime unless it involves active fraud, such as the forgery of paperwork. They will continue to treat evasion by their own citizens as a civil matter but finally, for foreigners, they have agreed in principle to provide on request the details of wealthy individuals and corporations who have income originating in Switzerland. The Swiss moved primarily because they were faced with the deeply undesirable prospect of finding themselves on a blacklist of unco-operative tax havens, due to be announced at the G20 meeting in London in April. This was not simply a threat of being named and shamed but, as the Guardian revealed this month, of being subjected to serious economic sanctions designed to drive away billions of dollars of their banking business. Since Switzerland earns 15% of its GDP from the finance sector, this threat made an impression. In the background, Switzerland&apos;s political authority has been severely weakened by the US investigation into one of its oldest and most prestigious banks, UBS, which has been caught brazenly helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade taxes. UBS staff have also been breaking the US law that forbids foreign bankers to tout for business, writing lies on their visa forms about the purpose of their visits to the US, carrying business cards that concealed their true profession and deploying counter-surveillance techniques. Even so, Switzerland continued to resist, arguing it simply could not afford to change its ways because it would lose so much business to other havens. But in a cleverly worked piece of diplomacy the OECD has persuaded all its main competitors \u2013 Liechtenstein, Singapore, Hong Kong, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg \u2013 to announce over the past 48 hours that they too would agree to provide information on tax evaders. But this remains only one battle in a long war against tax dodgers. No information will be disclosed until the Swiss have negotiated detailed double-taxation agreements with other nations. That process could take several years. The Swiss are indicating they will hand over information only if a detailed request is submitted and if that request complies with their own procedures. They are also calling for a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; that would allow them to continue to conceal all information about accounts or investments made with them in the past. Since Swiss banks are believed to hold something like a third of the estimated $11.5tn of personal wealth hidden offshore, this would knock a very big hole in yesterday&apos;s announcement. One source suggested this was simply a PR gesture to persuade existing account holders to stay. Bruno Gurtner, the Swiss economist who chairs the global board of the Tax Justice Network, welcomed today&apos;s announcement but warned nothing would change until the new treaties were negotiated. &quot;In the meantime, people with accounts in Switzerland have the chance to move their money away to other havens that still do not accept the principles,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/15/edison-chen-triad-death-threats", "sentences": ["Chen had made a tentative attempt to resurrect his career, with two brief public appearances in Singapore - one at the launch of a burger chain.", "But a spokesman for Media Asia Distribution said it would seek the advice of both the Hong Kong and Singapore police."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-15T00:01:00Z", "title": "Asian star Edison Chen threatened by Triad gangs", "tags": ["China", "Television industry", "Television", "Media", "Culture", "World news", "Film", "Television & radio", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The path from notoriety to redemption is well trodden for scandal-hit stars in the West. A sober apology; a brief spell out of the limelight; then the comeback project, prompting hundreds of column inches and, with luck, greater success. It doesn&apos;t work like that in Asia, at least not for the disgraced pop star, Edison Chen. Until last year, Chen was a singer, actor and heart-throb; at 27 he was one of the most recognisable faces in Asian showbusiness. Then the eruption of an extraordinary sex scandal, involving the publication of thousands of his explicit photos of some of the Hong Kong&apos;s best-known female stars, led to self-imposed exile in his birthplace of Canada. The response to his attempted return to the spotlight this week has been chilling: a gold bullet and a &quot;final warning&quot; to make no further appearances. Chen had made a tentative attempt to resurrect his career, with two brief public appearances in Singapore - one at the launch of a burger chain. The reaction was brutal. This week, the Hong Kong television station Cable TV said it had received a gold-coloured 9mm round and a typed letter, in English, warning Chen not to appear in public after April 4. &quot;We hope Edison Chen will take this warning seriously, otherwise his personal safety will be threatened,&quot; the letter went on. Chen announced that he was quitting showbusiness after the scandal broke last year and fled to Canada, reportedly telling police that he believed his life was under threat. He has refused to return to the territory for next month&apos;s trial of a man accused of stealing the pictures from his laptop, instead giving evidence in Vancouver. While he has given no public hint of who might want to kill him, or why, the idea may be less far-fetched than it sounds; lurid rumours have long flown about the involvement of Triads in the territory&apos;s entertainment industry. The head of the company behind Chen&apos;s forthcoming movie The Sniper, which was delayed owing to last year&apos;s furore, said he would continue to publicise it and Chen yesterday let it be known that he intended to return to Sinagpore to help with promotion. But a spokesman for Media Asia Distribution said it would seek the advice of both the Hong Kong and Singapore police. The warnings are the latest twist in the biggest scandal to hit Chinese entertainment, which began when a couple of explicit photographs appeared on the web. At first, people believed they might be fake. Then, day by day, more and more appeared - showing more and more well known actors and singers in bed with Chen. &quot;It was the selective release of information that managed to drag out a simple event over many, many weeks. If the whole thing had been released on day one, it would have gone away,&quot; said Roland Soong, who wrily documented the phenomenon on his EastSouthWestNorth blog. &quot;It was at the top of the headlines in the top three Hong Kong papers for 21 days in a row... People stayed up all night waiting [for more] and discussion forums were frozen because there was so much traffic.&quot; As the story spread to the mainland, censors battled to remove the pictures but failed to stem the appetite: one online discussion generated more than 25m page views and 140,000 comments. In his apology, Chen stressed that the photographs were private and consensual. But the backlash was such that several of the women involved chose to end their careers, while others hoped that keeping a low profile might allow them to make a comeback. Gillian Chung, half of the popular singing duo Twins, and actor Cecilia Cheung have both given interviews in recent weeks but met with very different reactions. While people seem to feel sympathy for Cheung, Chung has been berated online and at a personal appearance this week.

Threats of suspensions sounded among the suspenders and the next day dawned with no sexy underwear in sight. The Shanghai players were oblivious, relaxed by watching the new film Valkyrie, and went on to win 4-1. The incident was minor but it highlights the challenges facing the league to realise the goal of AFC president Mohammad Bin Hamman, who believes it will be competing with its European bigger brother within 10 years. It won&apos;t be easy. The tournament has struggled since its inception in 2003 \u2013 before which it was known as the &quot;Asian Club Championship&quot;. While there are fierce rivalries at national-team level, the arrival of a Saudi club in Tokyo or a Korean side in Dubai means little to many who still have the Uefa version in mind when they talk about the Champions League. It is not all the fans&apos; fault. Some clubs, especially in the Far East, were initially reluctant to put in the time and effort \u2013 and a midweek clash in Asia can cost a great deal of both \u2013 for winning a competition that until this year netted just $600,000. That was for the winners, most others were left out of pocket. Only three years ago, Korea&apos;s Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors even wanted to quit in order to cut costs, but a hefty withdrawal fine blocked the Motors&apos; exit. They stayed, won the whole thing and Hyundai executives were soon drooling over showing their brand at the Fifa Club World Cup, a carrot introduced in 2005. The idea behind it was to make the trophy more attractive to previously lukewarm J-League sides. Urawa Reds were the first team to give it a serious go. The club, one that has excelled at marketing longer than it has on the pitch, regularly attracts 50,000 fans to home games and their win in 2007 gave the ACL the credibility and iconic images it needed. Now the AFC is trying to move the tournament to the next level. First, it has a new format this season: 32 teams in eight groups of four, with east and west Asia separated until the knockout stage and two teams instead of one progressing to the next round. The governing body, tired of the way some clubs operate (expulsions for failing to submit player registrations on time were annual events), has become ruthless. Each league was evaluated on criteria that ranged from the quality of the stadiums and marketing to the proximity of international airports. Japan was the only A-grade student, followed by South Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The &quot;Big Five&quot; were given four spots each (UAE have three plus one qualifier). Australia, Uzbekistan and Qatar have two, with Indonesia allowed one. A club each from Singapore, India, Vietnam and Thailand can try the play-offs. With only 10 out of 46 members having automatic entry, it leaves the European version looking positively egalitarian and, unlike Uefa&apos;s co-efficient ranking, it has little to do with past performances. But for the AFC it creates a core that can drive standards forward. It has started well. This season features the first ever professional league in UAE, and Australia&apos;s A League will expand from eight to 10 teams. Japan, China and Korea have 18, 16 and 15 top-flight teams respectively and are developing extensive lower league networks. In attendance terms, more people are watching the J-league than the Eredivisie, while the Chinese Super League and the K-league outdraw Portugal and Belgium. There is big investment in Uzbekistan and rumours that in Iran some clubs will be moved out of public and into private control. Money also helps encourage the teams and in 2009 the Asian champions will collect around $1.5m. It may be small beer compared to Europe&apos;s offerings, but it is a big step. Asia also boasts a much richer competition than the European version. Only one quarter-finalist from 2005 made it to the knockout stage in 2006 (with the exception of the holders who got a bye \u2013 a practice now rightly abolished). The same happened in 2007 and 2008. Yet this may not help increase interest in the league. For television in Asia, familiarity breeds content as rivalries and stars need to be developed if Europhiles (often dismissive of their local leagues) are to be persuaded that Asia is exciting \u2013 although fortunately time differences mean that televised AFC and Uefa games don&apos;t clash. Gamba Osaka&apos;s win in 2008 helped to put Yasuhito Endo on the map but more of the same is needed, such as expanding representation from the &quot;Big Five&quot; so 2009 stars return in the future. These stars light the way forward and their status will be helped by the start of an intra-continental transfer market. This year has seen most Asian nations adopt the &quot;3 plus 1 rule&quot;. Leagues limit the number of foreign players to three per team, now they can sign one more \u2013 provided he comes from an AFC member. It is early days but Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Australian stars are now moving around Asia. With two Chinese teams losing in Japan last week, Beijing media seized upon the exploits of Li Weifeng. The one-time (literally) Everton defender starred as the K-league&apos;s Suwon thrashed the Japanese champions, Kashima Antlers, 4-1. For the first time in Korea, interest was shown in the western region of the group stage thanks to Fulham&apos;s loan of Seol Ki-hyeon to Saudi Arabia&apos;s Al Hilal. A few world stars who aren&apos;t approaching imminent retirement wouldn&apos;t go amiss either. With oil-rich clubs in the west and eastern outfits with links to big business, the money is potentially there for the right big name. In recent years, however, it just hasn&apos;t happened. Ageing stars such as Gabriel Batistuta and the De Boers liked the sunshine, the gentle schedules, the proximity to Europe and the expat life in the Gulf \u2013 more &quot;professional&quot; regimes may not appeal. It is harder to tempt footballers to the more distant, colder and, both on the pitch and off, more frantic eastern regions. More players are needed and not just for marketing purposes. Asian teams don&apos;t usually have the strength in depth to sustain challenges at home and abroad. When Urawa won in 2007, they promptly collapsed with exhaustion and, over the final five games of the J-League season, lost a 10-point lead and the title. 2006 winners Jeonbuk finished 11th in Korea and Gamba Osaka managed eighth. Japanese clubs are again the favourites, with South Korean teams such as Suwon Bluewings and FC Seoul, the latter coached by Turkey&apos;s 2002 World Cup boss, Senol Gunes, close behind. In the middle of the continent, big-spending, Eto&apos;o-chasing Bunyodkor have the competition&apos;s one world star, Rivaldo, as well as half of the Uzbekistan national team to call on. If gas drives the Central Asian challenge then oil fuels western dreams of a first win since 2005. While the really big names have gone, there is still enough talent to cause problems. Al Jazira and Al Ahli of UAE have Brazilians while Saudi Arabian powerhouses Al Hilal and Al Ittihad have Swedish, Egyptian and Moroccan internationals as well as a wealth of experience winning titles at home and abroad. There is one element to the new format that may backfire on the AFC this season. The Tehran titans Persepolis and Esteghlal regularly attract 70,000-plus crowds. While unlikely on paper, should these rivals, the fiercest in Asia, make the final, both red and blue fans will have to travel all the way to Tokyo for a one-off match in November \u2013 it used to be two-legged. For all the new investment and marketing, therefore, the competition could end in a damp squib. Asian club fans don&apos;t travel overseas in anything approaching large numbers (only Korea&apos;s Seongnam, owned by the wealthy Unification church, AKA &apos;The Moonies&apos;, attract big support in Japan courtesy of local church members \u2013 check out the massed yellow ranks), AFC officials will be praying that a Japanese club makes the final. It may be a mistake to follow Uefa in this aspect but the Asian Champions League is set on shadowing, and one day catching, the giant to the west."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/20/diary-hugh-muir", "sentences": ["&quot;In order to abide by the letter of the contract, while still attaining a likely optimal solution, why not ask Sir Fred to collect his pension every week in cash from his local RBS office,&quot; writes Anthony Stevens in a letter from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-20T00:01:00Z", "title": "Diary: Hugh Muir", "tags": ["Politics"], "article": "What a swell party it would have been; Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone, sharing jokes, swapping insults all live on Any Questions? on Radio 4.

A high-speed straight into a tight hairpin here, a nice little left-right-left chicane there: easy enough. Maybe that&apos;s why so many fans think they could do a better job than Hermann Tilke, the world&apos;s leading circuit designer. The German has been accused of penning boring tracks and, even worse, of butchering legendary ones like Hockenheim. Yet according to those most affected by the 54-year-old&apos;s designs, he is able to marry the needs of the drivers, cars and fans better than anyone else. The former formula one driver Anthony Davidson, a race commentator for BBC Radio 5 Live, says he has never heard any of his fellow drivers moan about a Tilke-designed circuit.  &quot;He understands the demands of the modern cars,&quot; says Davidson. &quot;You see very wide circuits with a lot of space; he gives us run-off areas and it&apos;s all well thought out. They are enjoyable to race on because they suit modern F1 cars. At a track like Silverstone you do not get as much overtaking because it was designed for cars that were slower and did not depend on downforce for speed. But the circuits designed in recent years have a long straight and bigger braking zone.&quot; It is quaint to picture Tilke, whose engineering firm has gone from strength to strength over 25 years, with pencil clamped between teeth, dreaming up his next circuit. In truth, a site inspection is the first stop and only once factors such as topography, wind direction, infrastructure and soil quality are known do the first sketches begin, with a group of four or five engineers taking part - and one significant other.  &quot;One of the very first things we do is to sit down with Mr Ecclestone who has a very good understanding and talent for design and has a feel for what is necessary for a venue to be a success,&quot; says Tilke, who competes in endurance races himself. Given the costs involved, it is no wonder such a lengthy process is involved. To build an F1 circuit of about three to four miles in Europe is said to cost in the region of \u00a3100m. Much of Tilke&apos;s effort goes into conceiving dramatic architecture that reflects the host country, like Sepang&apos;s lotus-leaf grandstands in Malaysia. Making sure spectators are comfortable is part of his philosophy, along with giving a good overview and building corners that promise a fast and interesting race but avoid pulling the field apart. There are only four circuit designers recognised by the FIA, formula one&apos;s governing body, and only one man who gets the F1 gigs: Tilke. But drivers and engineers do not give a care to the name behind a track, provided it offers them something to get their teeth into. &quot;Looking at Tilke circuits, if you take Shanghai and compare it with Turkey, they do present different challenges,&quot; says Red Bull Racing&apos;s head of car engineering, Paul Monaghan. He points to circuits like Sepang, where it is necessary to steer while under-braking. &quot;It&apos;s one of the trickiest things - it gives the drivers something to show their skill with.&quot; A great design seems to be one that makes life difficult for the teams and drivers. Clive Bowen is managing director of Apex Circuit Design, which built the Dubai Autodrome, a track that was made to F1 standard but has yet to appear on the calendar. &quot;We play Machiavelli on purpose and with great fun, putting more or less grip at certain parts of the circuit,&quot; he says. &quot;If you can make the engineers&apos; job harder, then there&apos;s a greater opportunity of a spread of vehicle set-up across the field, so a greater opportunity of overtaking.&quot; Bowen admires Tilke&apos;s work, especially Istanbul Park in Turkey, which he describes as &quot;a technical and aesthetic tour de force&quot;, and sympathises with the difficulties of modifying existing tracks. Tilke has come in for criticism for his re-working of circuits like Hockenheim, with fans overlooking the constraints placed on him by safety regulations.  &quot;By cutting off that long blast down through the woods at Hockenheim he was just joining the dots - he did not have much room for manoeuvre,&quot; says Bowen. When Tilke is given a blank canvas, however, the results are different. Take Istanbul&apos;s infamous Turn Eight. &quot;A bit of a legend,&quot; says Davidson. &quot;I wish I&apos;d designed it,&quot; says Bowen. Don&apos;t we all?

Making allowances for collecting luggage and checking in, we estimate we have seven or eight hours for a trip into the city. Do you think this is feasible? I know the left luggage facility at the airport has been closed as a result of the terrorist threat, so we would have to take the luggage with us. As an alternative we wondered if a trip to the Taj Mahal would be possible?S Schofield, Ormskirk A I agree with your timings, but you should add one hour each way to get to and from the city. You may wish to consider hiring a car and driver to take you downtown and to what you wish to see. Metropole (metrovista.co.in) is recommended by the Lonely Planet India guide. This would give you somewhere to store your luggage (the boot of the car) but if your driver isn&apos;t staying with your vehicle he should be able to suggest a guesthouse that will look after your bags for a small fee. Alternatively, you could use the Delhi Traffic Police Prepaid Taxi Booth just outside the international terminal entrance. You&apos;ll get a prepaid voucher (around 300Rs - \u00a34) to give to the driver once you&apos;re at your destination.  You won&apos;t have time to make it to the Taj Mahal but you should be able to see the main sights of Old Delhi - the Red Fort, the National Museum and Jama Masjid mosque. You&apos;ll need a transit visa to leave the airport. Visa services are outsourced by the Indian High Commission to VFS (0905 757 0060; in.vfsglobal.co.uk). Check out India Mike (indiamike.com) for more information. Q I plan to cycle with a friend from Santander to Santiago de Compostela in the first fortnight of May. We&apos;d like to hire bikes in Santander and bring them back there by train on 16 May. Initial research indicates that bike hire for such a trip outside Santander could be difficult. Do you have any advice, especially about bike hire, as well as about places to stay en route, and information about returning by train, please?Michael McSorley, by email A  Most people take their own bikes with them on the pilgrim trail so they can be sure of a reliable and comfortable ride. However, assisting walkers and cyclists on the pilgrim routes to Santiago is a growing industry in northern Spain and it&apos;s now possible to arrange for one-way bike hire so you won&apos;t need to bring the bike back on the train. Tour&apos;n&apos;ride (tournride.com), which is based in Santiago, can deliver to locations across northern Spain and will also supply panniers, helmets and GPS. Its online booking tool quoted me \u20ac139 to hire a mountain bike for two weeks in June.  A wealth of information about accommodation along the various pilgrim routes is available on the website of the Confraternity of St James (csj.org.uk) and via its online bookshop. The easiest route back from Santiago is via the ALSA bus (alsa.es), which takes from six to eight hours, requires making a connection in Oviedo and costs \u20ac55. Be careful to travel on an inter-city bus rather than a &quot;normal&quot; service, as this will make far more stops. The train requires a change in Palencia and will be a longer journey.  Q I have a son in Sydney, who has two children under three, and a daughter in Scotland, with two children under four. We would like to get together for a family holiday next year - somewhere convenient for both families, preferably without changing planes. The time of year is open as schools are not yet an issue. What would you suggest?Bob Glaister, by email A You need to narrow this down a bit. Start with places that are easy to get to. OAG Flights (oag.com) is a good place to check and compare flight times between any two airports. As a general guide, major hub airports such as Singapore, Bangkok and Los Angeles will offer the best connections and prices, as well as being roughly halfway between Australia and the UK. Weather will be another deciding factor. Southern California is great year-round but flights are at their busiest and most expensive during December and January and from the start of July to the end of August. The same fare considerations apply to south-east Asia, but you should also consider the wet season, which can strike at different times of year depending on where exactly you head to. In Thailand, which is possibly the best destination for your family holiday, July-September and March are quite soggy, while Singapore is most prone to deluges between November and January. Weather2Travel (weather2travel.com) is the best place for further research. Q My wife and I are going to Toronto in late-May for 12 nights. We are staying with relatives for the first five nights in Toronto, but then we want to go elsewhere for a week. Can you recommend a second destination within Canada with enough to keep us occupied, great scenery and nice walks. We do not drive, so it would need to be accessible by train - we would rather not fly internally. Michael Goldby, London A The Canadian wilderness is tough to access without your own wheels. However, from Toronto you could join an expedition north. Call of the Wild (call-wild.com) offers canoeing, hiking and horse-riding trips in the Algonquin National Park, 140 miles north of Toronto, and can arrange transport. Accommodation is at the comfortable Algonquin Eco Lodge (algonquinecolodge.com, doubles from \u00a370), which is three hours by road from Toronto.  After this, Montreal would make an excellent second city destination. Easy to get to by train from Toronto (viarail.ca; from \u00a381 return), the city is packed with great architecture and museums, and has a lively Old Town and waterfront to explore.  From Montreal you can also take a bus (see hostellingtremblant.com for details) to Ville de Mont Tremblant (tremblant.ca), from where you can go hiking, canoeing, cycling or enjoy the scenery without the need for a car. Pretty much wherever you stay or what you want to do can be reached by shuttle bus. The Canadian Tourism Commission (canada.travel) can help with further questions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/mar/23/china-film-quota", "sentences": ["The zone will be unveiled at a special meeting of Asian film industry executives and media policymakers from Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore and Macau today at the Hong Kong Filmart conference."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-23T17:57:07Z", "title": "China plans Shanghai zone where Western film quota to be relaxed", "tags": ["Danny Boyle", "Film", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "It could spell the beginning of the end for a seven-year-old policy which caps the number of foreign films allowed to screen in China each year at 20.

The &quot;special cultural administrative region&quot; in Shanghai&apos;s Wai Gao Qiao free trade district would be a testing ground for further reform of government policy on foreign imports. The aim is also to boost the number of Chinese films which perform well in western markets, of which there have been only a handful in the past decade. China has adopted a strict quota for film imports since joining the World Trade Organisation in 2002. The government also censors any films which it objects to on cultural grounds, and China&apos;s own output is carefully controlled.

That&apos;s counterproductive. It should be a collaborative process for the whole region.&quot; China recently signalled a shift in policy by allowing Danny Boyle&apos;s Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire to enjoy wide release in the country.

The figures show a marked increase from 2007, when the total stood at 1,252, according to research carried out by Amnesty International and published today.  Although there has been a trend in recent years for the abandonment of the death penalty, 25 countries executed people last year.

It must be brought to an end.&quot;  Khan added that the &quot;good news&quot; was that executions were only carried out by a small number of countries. This showed, she said, that &quot;we are moving closer to a death-penalty-free world.

But, in the past, Albert Park has been a good track for Renault, and so I hope we can have a strong weekend.&quot; Renault, though, are understood to be one of the teams opting not to use the new kinetic energy recovery system (Kers) on Sunday. That is despite the fact Alonso is happy with the device that could give drivers a boost equating to several tenths of a second per lap at the touch of a button as energy normally lost under braking is stored. The downside is the weight and packaging of the system \u2013 and its impact on the car&apos;s weight distribution. &quot;With the Kers and moveable wings, the drivers now have more work to do inside the cockpit,&quot; said Alonso. &quot;I&apos;m not sure if it will make overtaking easier, but it will certainly improve lap times.&quot; With a ban on in-season testing, it will make development in the factory pivotal if any team is to be successful.

Berne is also being advised to warn the country&apos;s banks and citizens that its financial sector, which generates around 13% of GDP, will have to shrink substantially and many of its private banks will go out of business or be forced to merge. The Swiss government has followed the advice of a taskforce of independent experts and senior officials, agreeing this month to comply with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards on banking secrecy to avoid being placed on the body&apos;s blacklist and avert pariah status at next week&apos;s G20 summit in London. Specialists helping to draw up Swiss defences are discussing a revised model treaty with the US authorities on exchanges of tax information. This could then serve as the basis for bilateral treaties with around 70 other fiscal jurisdictions around the globe. It is likely that the federal government, which appointed the taskforce of specialists and senior officials only two weeks ago, will heed their advice. The Swiss would then be asked to swallow their pride and approve it in a national vote. The alternative would be to conclude separate treaties with each country and put each to a national referendum in a process that could last 150 years, Swiss sources say. Alfred Mettler, an associate professor of finance at Georgia state university in the US, and one of five independent experts, told the Guardian: &quot;The key thing for Berne is to secure a level playing field with other jurisdictions \u2013 Austria, Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Andorra and the rest. &quot;If Switzerland really sticks to the OECD rules and the others don&apos;t, it will be shooting itself in the foot. The playing field must be as level as possible and you don&apos;t reach that goal alone. This has got to be a concerted effort through legal and diplomatic channels, winning allies among the key countries that want to change the secrecy rules: the US, UK, France and Germany.&quot; Switzerland is estimated to be home to a third of the $11tn (\u00a37.5tn) of wealth and assets hidden from global tax authorities. Its biggest bank, UBS, was fined a record $780m by the US authorities for abetting offshore tax evasion. It is under new legal pressure to disclose the names of 52,000 US citizens with Swiss accounts as its wealthy clients continue to pull out billions of assets previously protected by the country&apos;s 75-year-old secrecy laws. Berne is being advised that it is in the country&apos;s interest to settle the case, even though the price could be a significant contraction of the wealth-generating financial sector. &quot;It is very clear you have to prepare for times when you won&apos;t have the flows of untaxed monies coming in any more,&quot; said one specialist, who did not want to be named. Pointing out Switzerland had already stopped inflows of criminal or terrorist money and assets from, among others, dictators, sources say the government should negotiate a timeframe to handle all untaxed income, say within a couple of years. There are no definitive estimates of the amount of untaxed wealth secreted in Swiss accounts. A senior private banker has suggested as much as 50% of assets under management in Geneva is untaxed, but others have suggested 10%. &quot;To lose 10 or 20% in the short run does not make you obsolete as a banking centre,&quot; Mettler said. &quot;It&apos;s very different from writing off 20% of a bank&apos;s assets on its balance sheet: that kills you.&quot; The outcome is likely to be that &quot;universal&quot; banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse will survive in shrunken form. Hans-Rudolf Merz, the Swiss finance minister, and regulators have made plain they will not allow a merger of the two banks.

We have civil partnerships, anti-discrimination legislation, anti-hate-crime laws, diversity policies coming out of our ears and openly gay MPs. Just a few weeks ago I even attended a reception at Downing Street to celebrate LGBT History Month. It is a great time to be gay. Or is it? It is widely acknowledged that we live in a global village \u2013 which makes everyone on this planet a neighbour. And right now there are more than 80 countries where homosexual acts are illegal, and several even have the death penalty. Execution/prison/torture and blackmail dangle over the heads of gay people who are driven undergound to live in invisibility and fear. These are laws that in effect criminalise a class of people, rather than behaviours (yes, I know I could choose not to have sex or meaningful relationships, but really, could you?)  This is not a natural or wholesome state of affairs. According to a recent and chilling report from Human Rights Watch, more than half of these laws were imposed on colonial outposts from that great Victorian period of globalisation known as the British empire. They are defended in many of those countries as useful for protecting nationhood and cultural authenticity from a decadent, homosexualising western influence. This is largely cultural amnesia of their origins and a continuation of that destructive and racist legacy. Racism may be a strange word to bandy about when discussing gay rights, but when laws against homosexuality were rolled out across the empire, it was to control and subjugate peoples who were considered unable to control their &quot;instincts&quot; and to protect the settlers from &quot;native&quot; cultures that did not punish &quot;perverse&quot; sex enough. The colonised needed compulsory re-education in sexual mores. To quote Human Rights Watch: &quot;Imperial rulers held that, as long as they sweltered through the promiscuous proximities of settler societies, &apos;native&apos; viciousness and &apos;white&apos; virtue had to be segregated: the latter praised and protected, the former policed and kept subjected.

Chen Shui-bian, 58, faces life imprisonment if convicted on charges of embezzling 104m New Taiwan dollars (\u00a32m) from a special presidential fund, receiving bribes worth at least \u00a36m in connection with a government land procurement deal, and laundering part of the funds by wiring the money to Swiss bank accounts. He has denied the charges against him, saying they are part of an effort by the current president, Ma Ying-jeou, and his Nationalist party to curry favour with rival China. Chen was replaced by Ma last May after serving eight years in office. Arriving at the courthouse from a Taipei detention facility where he has been held since December, Chen looked wan and thin, as dozens of police officers maintained order. Today&apos;s trial follows two months of pretrial hearings to review key elements in the case against Chen, his wife, Wu Shu-chen, their son, daughter-in-law and several aides and associates. Millions of Taiwanese have been engrossed by the spectacle of the former leader being accused of the same type of corruption he pledged to eradicate when he first ran for president in 2000. The charges against him and his wife outline a complex scheme in which Chen allegedly allowed Wu to take bribes from businesspeople seeking political favours. Chen has professed ignorance of those alleged transactions, stressing that the former first lady alone managed millions of dollars in political donations and other funds. On the first day of the trial, expectations about its outcome were mixed. While analysts say much of the pretrial evidence against Chen seems overwhelming, they suggest prosecutors will be hard pressed to present concrete proof to convict him of taking bribes. &quot;There are many grey areas that Chen could use for his defence,&quot; said Huang Chih-hsien, a political commentator. &quot;Unlike America, Hong Kong or Singapore, we cannot convict a politician simply for failing to prove his wealth has come from legitimate means,&quot; Huang said. &quot;The prosecutor must also prove that a deal was struck to hand out political favours in exchange for bribes.&quot; In February, Wu pleaded guilty to accepting a \u00a31.5m political donation in connection with a land purchase deal, but denied that it had been a bribe, as alleged by prosecutors. Yesterday, her husband&apos;s office released a statement in his name, alleging that all the proceedings against him were part of a deliberate government effort to silence dissent and placate China \u2013 which still sees Taiwan as part of its territory, 60 years after the sides split amid civil war. Chen maintained a strong pro-independence stance for the self-governed island during his two terms in power. &quot;The judicial system in Taiwan has become a mere tool for political suppression and persecution,&quot; the statement said. &quot;In order to gain favour and protection from the Beijing authorities, the Nationalist government has launched an all-out purge and cleansing against the former ... administration.&quot; Since taking office, Ma has moved aggressively to improve relations with China, particularly on the commercial and economic front."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/27/achilleas-kallakis-fraud-inquiry", "sentences": ["Last year Pacific said it would focus a \u00a3700m war chest on property developments in Singapore and Malaysia."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-27T00:01:00Z", "title": "Inquiry into Achilleas Kallakis' multimillion property deals with banks", "tags": ["Serious Fraud Office", "Property", "London", "Business", "Money", "Law"], "article": "Achilleas Kallakis, the Greek tycoon and high-stakes poker player who has invested more than \u00a3850m buying some of London&apos;s most valuable properties, is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over hundreds of millions of pounds in loans he took out to pursue his spending spree. The SFO yesterday confirmed it had raided two offices and two residential addresses, all in central London, in relation to an alleged property loan fraud. Kallakis, who has a large apartment on Carlos Street, Mayfair, is understood not to have been present. Last year he was ranked the 11th-richest Greek, with a \u00a3250m fortune, though a collapse of his London property empire is likely to see that wealth substantially destroyed.  The alleged fraud centres on companies linked to Kallakis suggesting to banks that property leases to tenants had higher rents, and were signed for longer periods, than was in fact the case. Tenants within his empire include the Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspaper titles and the Metropolitan Police at a property in Victoria acquired from Telegraph owners the Barclay brothers; the Home Office&apos;s Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon, bought from the Tchenguiz brothers; and the Department of Health in Vauxhall acquired from the Reuben brothers. Kallakis&apos;s estate, largely controlled through Pacific Group, the investment arm of his offshore family trust, extends to 1.6m sq ft, spread across 13 buildings bought between 2003 and 2007, the height of the commercial property market. Since then prices have plummeted. Just before the credit crunch bit in the summer of 2007, Kallakis, who splits his time between Monaco and London, claimed to be developing the world&apos;s most expensive penthouse apartment in a St James&apos;s Square property bought for \u00a3120m from pension fund group Hermes. He suggested that the 20,000 sq ft flat would fetch \u00a3105m. Last year Pacific said it would focus a \u00a3700m war chest on property developments in Singapore and Malaysia. Kallakis&apos;s name has also been linked with other Tchenguiz-owned properties. But the SFO believes that bogus paperwork suggests Kallakis had certain &quot;overriding&quot; long-term lease guarantees with an investment-grade property company at high rents. This was presented to lending banks, giving them confidence to finance a number of multimillion-pound Kallakis property purchases.  Among the banks allegedly duped by Kallakis is Allied Irish, which advanced him a series of loans over a five-year period for the purchase of UK real estate. Last year AIB became aware of issues with the loans and conducted an internal review. It became apparent that the guaranteed &quot;overriding&quot; leases were fraudulent, a fact since confirmed to the SFO and AIB by the investment grade property group with which Kallakis claimed to have an agreement. AIB quickly took control of the properties against which loans had been advanced and sold them to Irish real estate firm Green Property, booking a \u00a356m writedown. Investors in the bank were not told until yesterday that the writedown related to a fraud on the bank and the episodes raises serious questions about the level of due diligence conducted before lending considerable sums to Kallakis. Reporting its full-year results last month, AIB told investors only that writedowns were &quot;influenced by a large case&quot;. Yesterday the bank revealed it was preparing legal actions in an attempt to recover some of the losses on the Kallakis loans. In a statement after the raids on Wednesday evening, the SFO said it &quot;believes that further financial institutions have also been deceived by the suspects&quot;. The unsilent Don Achilleas Kallakis is known as one of the most colourful characters in the London property market. He made a name for himself on the international poker circuit using the nickname of The Don. He has won as much as $1m in international tournaments. Though he is believed to be related to the Kallakis Greek shipping family, he calls himself &quot;his excellency&quot; and claims to be a San Marino ambassador.

Next door, the houses of parliament will switch off all its lights too, along with thousands of landmarks, buildings and people around the world in a global gesture of solidarity in the fight against climate change. From the international dateline, Earth Hour starts in New Zealand&apos;s Chatham Islands and will conclude in Honolulu. Passed like a baton around the planet, cities including Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Moscow, Istanbul, Dubai, Cape Town and Las Vegas will be darkened for an hour at 8:30pm local time to mark Earth Hour, the single biggest mass event to mark public concern over global warming. More than 3,200 cities across 88 countries have signed up and the event has received support from international leaders including Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Environment campaign group WWF, which is co-ordinating the global event, expects hundreds of millions of people around the world to take part in turning out their lights for an hour, in the hope of sending a direct message to world leaders that their voters want urgent action to save the planet from rising temperatures. &quot;Earth Hour is shaping up to be an impressive symbolic response to our planet in peril,&quot; said the climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, who is supporting the event. &quot;Popular pressure like this will leave little doubt around the negotiating table in Copenhagen this December that a meaningful global carbon deal must be delivered. Making us all more aware of the energy we use is a critical first step in making lasting changes to our lifestyles.&quot; The Eiffel Tower, Shanghai&apos;s Hong Kong New World Tower, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Sydney&apos;s Opera House and Table Mountain in Cape Town will all take part. In London, Nelson&apos;s Column, City Hall, the National Gallery and the National Theatre will switch off their lights. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol, the Belfast Wheel and Scotland&apos;s Forth rail bridge and Edinburgh castle will all go dark. Over 1,200 schools in the UK have also been active in the run-up to Earth Hour, with pupils receiving lessons on the challenges faced by climate change. WWF&apos;s head of campaigns, Colin Butfield, said the idea was that children would then go home and pester their parents to turn out lights . Members of the Women&apos;s Institute have also been encouraged to support the event at home. Almost 400 British businesses are also taking part. Furniture retailer Ikea will turn off the lights outside its stores while Coca-Cola will switch off its advertising screen at Piccadilly Circus, only the third time it has been extinguished since the second world war. &quot;We hope it communicates the importance of everybody being involved in this and hopefully this will increase awareness that everybody needs to do their part, that includes governments, NGOs and individuals,&quot; said Coca-Cola&apos;s Euan Wilmshurst. Green electricity company, Good Energy, has written to its 25,000 customers, encouraging them to turn out their lamps and light candles for an hour instead. Founder and chief executive Juliet Davenport encouraged people at home to play candle-lit board games and said that mass events such as Earth Hour allowed people to see how small actions, of the kind needed to tackle climate change at an individual level, could add up to something influential on a global scale. The idea for Earth Hour grew out of a similar campaign held by WWF&apos;s Australian campaigners in 2007. For the global version, the campaign group chose 2009 because of the negotiations in Copenhagen to set climate targets after the Kyoto protocol runs out in 2012. Campaigners have not calculated the amount of energy that might be saved by the combined action around the world, arguing that Earth Hour is more symbolic than a direct attempt to save carbon emissions. &quot;When global leaders meet at the UN conference in Copenhagen later this year, they are going to determine how the world will work together to tackle climate change in future. We need them to know that the eyes of the world will be upon them,&quot; said Butfield. &quot;Earth Hour is a simple way for people all over the world to make sure our leaders really understand that people are looking to them to do what is right and that the time for action is now.&quot; Not everyone is so positive, however. Organisers had hoped for the participation from the Forbidden City in Beijing but Chinese government officials have told their citizens to hold back because Earth hour clashes with Serf Liberation Day in Tibet, a new holiday to commemorate the ousting of the Dalai Lama from the province. George Marshall, of the charity Climate Outreach and Information Network, questioned whether darkness was the right symbol. &quot;This action offers darkness, regression and the threat of less. Light has always been a symbol of progress, civilisation, intelligence, truth. Turning off lights has always been a symbol of collapse \u2011 the Dark Ages.&quot; But Andy Ridley, of WWF in Australia, said: &quot;For the people who take part, we hope there is a sense of empowerment, the knowledge that however small or big the actions you can effect in your life, whether you are a CEO or doing your GCSEs you can make a difference when these actions are brought together.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/29/tax-havens", "sentences": ["Even so, in the last two months a surge of tax treaties have been signed by countries including Liechtenstein, Singapore, Switzerland, Austria, Andorra and Belgium in an effort to abide by global protocols."], "publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z", "title": "Tax havens batten down as the hurricane looms", "tags": ["Tax avoidance", "Business", "Global economy", "World news"], "article": "Home to 160 powerful US Congressmen, Rayburn House on Capitol Hill in Washington DC was the venue last Monday for a desperate resistance movement at its darkest hour. In the basement of the sprawling whitewashed classical complex, 70 senior politicians and their advisers heard that prising open to increased scrutiny the secretive and corrupt world of tax havens - where trillions of dollars are stashed far from the reaches of the tax man - was akin to an evil Big Brother conspiracy that would smash civil liberties and hamper world economic growth. It was organised by Dan Mitchell, co-founder of the right-wing Center for Freedom and Prosperity, and Richard Rahn, a senior fellow at influential libertarian Washington think-tank, the Cato Institute, a former board member of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and a regular Washington Post columnist. They told the high-powered audience that moves to force so-called secrecy jurisdictions to share information with tax authorities were &quot;hypocritical&quot;, &quot;racist&quot; and would destroy &quot;defenceless&quot; island economies.  Mitchell, a high priest of light tax, small state libertarianism, argued that current moves to encourage information exchange between secretive tax havens and the international community would see unscrupulous government officials sell highly sensitive information about the world&apos;s richest companies and individuals to drug cartels and warlords. Tax transparency would lead to kidnapping and murder. For Mitchell, this is familar territory. In 2001, when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, (OECD) the world&apos;s most powerful think-tank, was intent on stamping down on &quot;harmful tax competition&quot;, his ferocious lobbying pulled off a stunning victory, persuading George W Bush to bring a halt to the OECD plan.  Eight years later, Mitchell is on the warpath again. &quot;Tax competition leads to low tax rates and increased prosperity,&quot; he told the Observer from his office in Washington. &quot;Sovereign entities have the right to secure tax privileges. Even if the US government does not like it.&quot; His audience last Monday sat in rapt silence. But the world&apos;s power brokers don&apos;t appear to be listening with similar attentiveness.  President Obama, Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Brown are now all intent on shining a light into so-called secrecy jurisdictions. This week in London, leaders of the G20 will attempt to frame a response to the growing global economic crisis. Tax havens, whatever Mitchell and Rahn argue, have moved to centre stage. These are desperate days for offshore financial centres. Never before have the world&apos;s most powerful countries united in their determination to expose the shadowy banking system that has mushroomed unchecked for the last 15 years. Lobbyists have been hired at huge cost to ensure that senior bankers and politicians from Cayman Islands, Switzerland and the Channel Islands meet and brief influential policymakers and congressmen. Jersey has hired London-based Aura Financial while the Cayman Islands retain Fleishman-Hillard. Even so, in the last two months a surge of tax treaties have been signed by countries including Liechtenstein, Singapore, Switzerland, Austria, Andorra and Belgium in an effort to abide by global protocols. Last week, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey signed more agreements with France, Germany and Ireland.  Such has been the capitulation by tax havens that senior international regulators say more has been achieved in the last 13 weeks than in the previous 13 years put together. Even the usually cautious OECD, which sets standards for international tax policy, admits that automatic multilateral information exchange - the holy grail for investigators seeking transparency in tax - is now on the agenda. Jeffrey Owens, the head of tax at the OECD, said he would not allow countries to stall on the process.  But well-placed Washington sources say ambassadors of Caribbean countries are putting pressure particularly on black caucus Congressmen in a bid to ward off this gathering storm of intrusion. They are being requested to water down any legislation and international regulations affecting the likes of the Cayman Isles, Antigua and Bermuda. It is a tactic that may work. In the US, it is understood a draft discussion paper from powerful Senate finance committee chairman Max Baucus on the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act waters down key parts of the proposed legislation long backed by Obama. The Caymans, singled out by Obama on the campaign trial for being home to Ugland House, where 18,857 shell companies were registered as of last year, is in a state of high alert. Although the target of criticism when John Kerry ran for president in 2004, scrutiny faded away after he failed to defeat Bush. So when Obama first turned his attention to the island&apos;s role in heaping more of the tax burden &quot;on ordinary hard-working Americans&quot;, no one blinked.  Now, though, it is very much in the public eye. In the last two months, the Cayman government has hosted visits from the International Monetary Fund, which was checking that the island meets international standards, and Michael Foot, a one-time inspector of banks for the Central Bank of the Bahamas, whose review into UK-linked tax havens will be published next month.  The island&apos;s authorities are keen to play down the visits, suggesting they are routine. Kurt Tibbetts, leader of government business for the Cayman Islands, said: &quot;The Cayman Islands was one of the first jurisdictions to commit to OECD standards for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters... [We] have and will continue to do all we can to receive equitable treatment, as by any rational analysis our financial services sector is transparent and co-operative. In particular, the 16 tax co-operation arrangements in fact represent over-compliance with the OECD benchmark of 12 such arrangements with OECD member states.&quot; In Jersey, which during the leveraged boom became a world leader in securitisations and hosted Granite, the Northern Rock securitisation vehicle, the island&apos;s leaders are keen to push forward the media-friendly Geoff Cook. As Jersey Finance&apos;s chief executive he spends his life promoting the island as an offshore centre throughout the world.  Cook is adamant that Jersey is one of the best regulated jurisdictions in the world. &quot;We are not a tax haven,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not have banking secrecy, we are a co-operative, transparent, well-regulated centre. We are tested by outside organisations and we have been found not wanting. If anybody thinks otherwise let them name names, bring evidence and I will happily notify the authorities.&quot; Though Cook admits that the island does not have a register of trusts, fund managers, he argues, know who the beneficiaries are. He concedes that in the seven years since the island signed a tax agreement with the US, Jersey has exchanged information with American investigators on just &quot;five or six&quot; cases. Earlier this month, Switzerland ended centuries of bank secrecy by offering to enter into &quot;bilateral&quot; tax information exchange agreements with rich countries. The fallout has created huge problems for the ruling coalition led by Hans-Rudolf Merz.  Half the population saw the groundbreaking move as a humiliating capitulation to hypocritical bullying by the United States and Britain. They point out that the US continues to offer corporations high levels of secrecy in the state of Delaware while Britain&apos;s own tax havens of the Channel Islands and its overseas territories based in the Caribbean, plus the non-domicile tax laws allow the world&apos;s super-rich to legally evade taxes on the bulk of their income.  The other half believe the government should have acted earlier to avoid the embarrassment of Switzerland being frozen out of this week&apos;s crucial G20 meeting of talks to restore the world&apos;s economy. It was obvious to many that once the scandal broke that saw giant Swiss bank UBS become the centre of a hugely damaging tax evasion scandal in the US, life for Swiss wealth managers would never be the same again.  And so it has proved: Swiss banks have now instructed their top executives not to travel abroad for fear of being arrested in wide-ranging tax investigations in America and Europe. A Swiss journalist last week posed as a rich individual with \u20ac3m of tax-evaded income to invest, asking wealth managers in five banks to hide his windfall. Five years ago the stunt saw all the banks suggest concrete measures to ensure the cash pile stayed intact. Last week just one bank offered advice. Swiss leaders are suggesting their concession ending bank secrecy will take years to implement and they will argue that the law should not be applied retrospectively so protecting the country&apos;s status as banker to the world&apos;s super-rich. Others argue they will only implement the measure if the US drops its legal action against UBS, which is calling for the bank details of up to 52,000 US citizens.  Influential commentators like Martin Wolf in the Financial Times and Avinash Persaud maintain that the agenda to clamp down on so called secrecy jurisdictions is a distraction. It is music to the ears of the leaders of Switzerland, Jersey and the Cayman Islands, who quote the pieces back almost verbatim denying their jurisdictions and financial sectors are remotely linked to the chaos that has gripped world markets for 18 months. Yet senior officials at the OECD say most of the world&apos;s insurance firms, hedge funds and private equity houses are registered in jurisdictions where reporting requirements are minimal. And the global banking system has hundreds of thousands of subsidiaries based in offshore centres. HSBC, in a disclosure to the Observer last month, revealed it has 2,008 legal subsidiaries around the world including in Liechtenstein, the Bahamas and Jersey. And as countries sink trillions of dollars bailing out banks running up huge deficits in the process, Treasury ministers are mindful of the $11.5tn locked away in tax havens which could provide $250bn in taxable income. As the prospect of increased supervision comes closer, the growing army of campaigning groups, churches and unions which have alighted on tax as the missing link in the poverty alleviation debate fear that proposals to increase information exchange will not go far enough. We will soon know whether Mitchell and his friends can keep the storm waters from lashing the world&apos;s tranquil financial havens. Britain&apos;s record Ten of the OECD&apos;s list of 35 tax havens are UK overseas territories or dependencies of the British crown.  Britain&apos;s crown dependencies consist of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. All three are independently administered and do not form part of the UK. However, they are possessions of the British crown and not sovereign nations. They are treated as part of the UK for British nationality law, and the British government is responsible for their defence and international representation. The power to pass laws affecting the islands rests with their legislative assemblies.  Westminster retains the right to legislate for the islands against their will, though this power is rarely used. Many key officials are also appointed by the British government. As a result, the exact nature of the relationship between the crown dependencies and the UK is hard to pinpoint. However, the 1973 Kilbrandon report concluded that the UK government is ultimately responsible for the islands&apos; good governance. The Ministry of Justice now has responsibility for them. The 14 British overseas territories are also under the sovereignty of the UK. The name came into being with the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, which granted UK citizenship to citizens of any of the territories, which include the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and Gibraltar. The head of state is the Queen, who generally appoints a governor as her representative on the advice of the British government. The governor deals mostly with foreign affairs and economic issues. UK sovereignty was recently demonstrated in relation to another overseas territory, the Turks and Caicos Islands. The British government revealed plans to take control of the islands, due to suspicion of systematic corruption following publication of an interim report by a commission of inquiry into the islands. The Foreign Office said parts of the islands&apos; constitution would need to be suspended. Again, the British government has the constitutional right to amend or suspend the laws allowing much of the offshore tax business taking place. The question is whether it has the will to do so.

It will require creditors to recognise that they cannot hold out for the prospect of endless government bailouts.&quot; The US government&apos;s taskforce for the auto industry shocked investors with the suggestion that a quick surgical bankruptcy might be the best chance for the companies to survive. &quot;I know that when people even hear the word &apos;bankruptcy,&apos; it can be a bit unsettling, so let me explain what I mean,&quot; Obama said. &quot;What I am talking about is using our existing legal structure as a tool that, with the backing of the US government, can make it easier for General Motors and Chrysler to quickly clear away old debts that are weighing them down so they can get back on their feet and on to a path to success; a tool that we can use, even as workers are staying on the job building cars that are being sold.&quot; The mood across Europe was bleak, with the French CAC market dropping by 2.75%, and Germany&apos;s DAX falling 3.5%. Carmakers were among the biggest losers: Daimler was down 6.4%, Fiat lost 4.6% and BMW tumbled 5.7%. &quot;A failure of General Motors would be negative for the other carmakers, as it would drag along a large number of suppliers,&quot; said Heino Ruland of Ruland Research. The World Bank forecast today that Russia&apos;s economy would shrink by 4.5% this year, a sharp reversal of its previous 3% growth forecast made in November which assumed higher oil prices. &quot;As the crisis continues to spread to the real economy around the world, initial expectations that Russia and other countries will recover fast are no longer likely,&quot; the World Bank said. Sharp declines were experienced on Asian stockmarkets, with Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei tumbling 4.5% to 8236.08, a fall of 390.89 points. The fall erased more than half of the Nikkei&apos;s 8.6% gain last week. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng lost 4.8% to 13,440.72 while Singapore&apos;s Straits Times index fell 4.68% to 1663.92. &quot;The fact that there&apos;s still a chance of GM going bankrupt is shocking,&quot; said Takashi Ushio of Marusan Securities.

Institutions that were once pillars of our society are being questioned. Restoring confidence will require strong and coordinated action by governments. It will also require a cultural change in banking institutions and greater transparency in financial systems.  In the short term, people need to be sure that the cost of tackling the crisis is fairly shared. But voters are also looking to governments to deal with long-standing structural problems.  If we want a stronger, cleaner and fairer world economy, we need to deal with the controversial areas of globalisation, such as tax havens. Tax havens did not cause this crisis. But abuse of the opaque operating conditions that they offer for would-be tax evaders clearly played a part.  It isn&apos;t only rich countries that suffer from the effects of tax havens. Developing countries also lose billions of dollars in tax revenues due each year because wealthy individuals and some companies use tax havens to move assets and income offshore.  At a time when governments need every tax dollar legally due to combat the world recession, such practices can no longer be tolerated. This is not just about protecting tax revenues. It&apos;s also about protecting the integrity of our tax systems. Transparency and effective tax co-operation must be shared principles applied by all. Until they are, nations will need to protect themselves against loss of revenues to tax havens. This will require distinguishing between those financial centres that are willing to implement international standards of transparency and exchange of information and those that are not.  That is about to become possible. The impulse has come from the G20, whose leaders last November specifically called for action on tax havens. Thanks to their political support, more progress has been achieved in the fight against tax havens in the last few weeks than over the past decade. The foundations for these developments were laid by the OECD in 2000, through a global forum in which OECD and non-OECD countries worked together to draw up agreed principles of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. These have now been endorsed by the G7/8, the G20 and the UN committee of experts on international co-operation in tax matters. The global forum, now including more than 80 countries and jurisdictions, provides a platform where participants can come together in a peer review process to make an annual review of progress.  Good intentions are one thing, however, and action is another. As of earlier this year, four OECD countries still had not adopted the OECD standard. Many offshore centres, meanwhile, were dragging their feet on promises they had made to assist in the fight against offshore tax evasion.  Now, however, things have suddenly begun to change. Following recent announcements by Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland, all 30 OECD member countries now share a common exchange of information enshrined in the OECD&apos;s Model Tax Convention. Other financial centres have also agreed to implement the OECD standards.  Hong Kong, Macao and Singapore have informed the OECD that they will adopt the OECD standards and will take steps this year towards implementation. Cyprus and Malta are implementing the standard with other partners, while Andorra, Liechtenstein and Monaco \u2013 the three remaining jurisdictions on the OECD&apos;s list of unco-operative tax havens \u2013 have declared that they will follow suit. Although some jurisdictions are still resisting, others, such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Jersey, are forging ahead with bilateral tax information exchange agreements.  Increased transparency will reinforce the principle of fairness in tax systems in both developed and developing countries. But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. Though the OECD and its partner countries can work together to develop standards and model tax agreements, real change will only come when governments act to implement them.  That&apos;s why the G20 leaders, when they meet in London on 2 April, will be cautious in claiming victory over tax haven abuse. They should certainly acknowledge the progress achieved so far. But they should also send a strong signal to those unco-operative jurisdictions still refusing to change. The fight against tax evaders is not yet over, but the international community is finally poised to take firm action against unco-operative tax havens. If we can rid the world of financial centres that thrive on lack of transparency, non-cooperation and weak regulation, an important step towards a fairer and cleaner world economy will have been achieved."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/01/g20-financial-crisis", "sentences": ["At the same time, countries ranging from France and the Netherlands to Singapore and Chile are adopting subsidies to companies for ongoing employment of low-wage workers."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-01T12:20:00Z", "title": "Edmund Phelps: A new regulatory framework must not stifle economic dynamism", "tags": ["G20", "Financial crisis", "Credit crunch", "Global recession", "Banking", "Banks and building societies"], "article": "When the G20 leaders convene, re-regulation of the financial sector will be high on the agenda.  Although the need for re-regulation is clear, the key issue is how to design regulation without discouraging funding for investment in innovation in the non-financial business sector. In regulators&apos; understandable desire to rein in the financial sector&apos;s excesses, there is the danger that policymakers \u2013 often pushed by the public \u2013 will adopt rules that dampen incentives and competition to the point that the sources of dynamism in the economy are weakened.  The need to encourage entrepreneurship and ensure that young people have the opportunity to start new businesses is acute. Even in the usually innovative American economy, dynamism has declined over the current decade, with economic inclusion \u2013 high employment rates and careers permitting ordinary people throughout society to flourish \u2013 also decreasing. The housing boom, of course, masked this decline in economic dynamism and inclusion. Now that the boom has ended, it is clear that a durable return to a normal degree of prosperity and inclusion will not take place until the financial sector is reoriented away from mortgage lending and reshaped to serve first and foremost the business sector.  A new regulatory framework must be internationally consistent, particularly in areas such as capital adequacy, liquidity management, and financial reporting standards for financial and non-financial corporations. The &quot;non-co-operating centres&quot; must also be regulated on a global and consistent basis. And new international arrangements should address the devastating impact of financial contagion from advanced countries on many emerging markets, in part by providing additional resources to multilateral lenders. At the same time, several key areas should be on the reform agenda. The first concerns regulating the scope of activities of banks, which, since the extreme dismantling of the regulatory framework in the late 1990s and early 2000s, have engaged in highly speculative and leveraged trading activities.  Some have called for a return to &quot;narrow banking&quot;. Commercial banks would use their deposits to make loans to consumers and small and medium-sized businesses, which would also facilitate risk management by re-personalising relationships between bankers and their clients. Investment banks might not be allowed to accept deposits from households and, possibly, non-bank businesses. By focusing regulation on deposit-taking banks, all other financial institutions \u2013 including hedge funds, private equity funds and other sources of risk capital that underpin economic dynamism \u2013 could bear the risk of bad decisions, without much regulation or potential cost to taxpayers (though with supervision to avoid systemic risk). Narrow banks could restart effective intermediation and ensure that consumers and employment-creating small and medium-size enterprises are adequately financed and can contribute to the reactivation of the economy. Moreover, the demise of banking conglomerates during the crisis offers an opportunity to devote at least the part of the public resources that have been earmarked for restructuring existing banks to the creation of a new class of banks. The new institutions will catalyse the reorientation of the financial sector toward serving the business sector by financing long-term investment and innovative projects. At the same time, countries ranging from France and the Netherlands to Singapore and Chile are adopting subsidies to companies for ongoing employment of low-wage workers. A development bank \u2013 specialising in project finance for infrastructure development, new technologies and investing in the working poor, the environment, and other capital projects \u2013 could be the ideal institution to channel and monitor this type of subsidy. The crisis also appears to provide an opportunity to develop more inclusive financial markets. The new regulatory framework should aim to &quot;democratise finance&quot; by redressing asymmetries in information, mainly stemming from the informational gap between sophisticated institutional market players and retail customers. This would enable households to expand their risk management through futures markets, home equity insurance and continuous workout mortgages. Finally, the new regulatory framework must address excessive swings in equity, housing, and other asset prices. It was the sharp reversal of upswings in equity and housing prices far above historical benchmark levels that helped to trigger \u2013 and continue to fuel \u2013 the financial crisis. As the downswings continue, there is a real danger that they may also become excessive and drag the economy and the financial system into an even deeper crisis. A new conceptual framework \u2013 Imperfect Knowledge Economics (IKE) \u2013 provides the rationale for policy intervention in asset markets, and also has important implications for how regulators should measure and manage systemic financial risk. IKE acknowledges that, within a reasonable range, the market does a far better (though not perfect) job in setting prices than regulators can. But it also recognises that price swings can become excessive, imposing high social costs. IKE suggests a panoply of novel measures, including &quot;guidance ranges&quot; for asset prices and targeted variation of margin and capital requirements, to help dampen such excessive movements.  One of this framework&apos;s important policy conclusions is that wholesale restrictions on short\u2010selling (and other such measures that pay no regard to whether an asset is over- or undervalued) could actually lead to greater instability. Yet improving the ability of financial markets to self\u2010correct to sustainable values is the entire point of prudential regulation. Rules that are beneficial in some circumstances may become counterproductive in others. The prevailing view that policymakers should be bound by fixed rules will not do.

But now clubs are braced for a major change in those arrangements which will seriously reduce their ability to attract leading Australian players and there are suggestions that they may be forced to make retrospective payments which in a couple of cases could run well into six figures. &quot;There&apos;s a shock coming for a lot of clubs,&quot; said one leading official who preferred not to be named, with the general expectation that 15% will be the maximum figure acceptable in future as the proportion of a player&apos;s salary that can be paid in image rights. At least 10 of the 14 Super League clubs are thought to be affected including all the major sides such as Leeds, St Helens and Warrington, whose chief executive, Andy Gatcliffe, revealed that his club are already in discussions with both the Revenue and the Rugby Football League. &quot;We at Warrington Wolves took quite a lead on this, and we have been looking at the situation with the players, legal advisers and the tax people to find out how best to handle it,&quot; said Gatcliffe. &quot;Several of the clubs including ourselves do have image rights agreements with players, and the Rugby Football League have been asked to co-ordinate on our behalf, just as the Rugby Football Union has been doing on behalf of their Premiership clubs.

The first rise in UK house prices since 2007 and improving credit conditions, alongside better-than-expected US car sales, fuelled optimism that the world economy is edging closer to a recovery. The news that the G20 will call for the International Monetary Fund&apos;s resources to be trebled to $750bn (\u00a3512bn) also bolstered confidence. &quot;Market participants are becoming more convinced of a global recovery and that is causing risk appetite to increase,&quot; said Toru Umemoto of Barclays Capital. In London, the FTSE 100 index rose through the 4,000 mark for the first time since mid-February. It held on to early gains this afternoon as Wall Street opened more than 200 points higher. The index of London&apos;s leading shares closed more than 4% higher at 4124.97, a rise of 169.36 points while the Dow was up more than 3% at 8029.14. The rally came after strong gains in Asia overnight. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index jumped 7.4% to 14521.97 points - its biggest daily gain in four months - while Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei closed 4.4% higher at 8719.78. Singapore&apos;s Straits Times index surged nearly 6%. Crude oil also surged on hopes that the G20 summit will deliver a package of measures to support global growth - which would increase demand for oil. US crude oil futures rose more than $3 a barrel to $51.53 earlier today. &quot;There&apos;s a desperation to grab on to any good news,&quot; said Manus Cranny at MF Global Spreads. &quot;House prices rising, Americans buying cars, steel manufacturers (ArcelorMittal) obtaining refinancing, world leaders smiling and the French turning up on time at Excel in London for the G20 is enough for one day to cheer the London and European markets and help them power ahead.&quot; Gordon Brown and Barack Obama have expressed confidence that the summit will come up with a strong agreement to tackle the problems of struggling economies, financial regulation and troubled banks. But Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, have refused calls for more government spending, and are pushing for concrete steps on tougher regulation. Sarkozy toned down his earlier threat to walk out of the summit last night, and Obama could be seen chatting with Merkel at the leaders&apos; dinner. The US president also said differences between the leaders had been &quot;vastly overstated&quot;. &quot;A new fiscal agreement will probably not come, but there&apos;s a feeling that they are going to organise themselves. Obama has drawn a line in the sand,&quot; said Cranny. He added that market expectations had been managed down so much that even if world leaders cannot agree on additional fiscal stimuli, a &quot;cohesive&quot; statement on financial regulation would be treated as good news. He thought the market would continue to drift higher over the next few days, although he was concerned that trading volumes were quite thin. Green shoots? Investors were also cheered by news that UK house prices recorded their first increase in March after 16 months of declines. And British lenders plan to make credit more easily available to households and businesses over the next few months, the Bank of England reported today. &quot;The economic outlook was no longer expected to be a factor bearing down on credit availability,&quot; the Bank&apos;s survey concluded. Daiwa economist Colin Ellis said the survey &quot;could mark a turning point for the UK economy&quot;. &quot;This positive news chimes with other glimmers of economic hope that have cropped up in recent weeks - heightening expectations that maybe the UK is indeed now past the worst of the recession. Time will tell - but we increasingly think so,&quot; he added. Britain&apos;s construction sector continues to shrink, but at a slower pace than before, a separate survey showed. The European Central Bank cut interest rates across the eurozone by a quarter point to 1.25% at lunchtime. The move was smaller than the half-point reduction expected by markets, sending the euro higher. It climbed 1% to $1.3357 against the dollar. On the other side of the Atlantic, US car sales fell by 37% in March - a smaller-than-expected drop that sparked hopes that the world&apos;s largest car market could be near the bottom. David Buik at BGC Partners said: &quot;Obviously, the summit will dominate the headlines for the next day or two. However it is as well to notice that there are a few not exactly green shoots of recovery but perhaps a sign that, with the exception of unemployment, we may be somewhere at the bottom of the cycle.&quot; He added: &quot;As is often the case, the market is likely to overdo it. However, there are signs of a greater appetite for risk. Also, it is fair to say the stockmarket fell much more quickly in 2008 than the economy did. Companies are now leaner and meaner so there may be some value out there.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-tax-havens", "sentences": ["These include Switzerland, Singapore, Chile and three EU countries \u2013 Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria \u2022 Those that have not committed to the standard, including Costa Rica, Malaysia, the Philipines and Uruguay."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-02T17:37:06Z", "title": "G20 declares door shut on tax havens", "tags": ["G20", "Politics", "UK news", "World news", "Economic policy", "France", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "China", "Tax avoidance", "Business", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The most dramatic crackdown on tax havens was unveiled by G20 leaders at their summit today, paving the way for the naming and shaming of countries that fail to comply with internationally agreed standards.

These include Switzerland, Singapore, Chile and three EU countries \u2013 Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria \u2022 Those that have not committed to the standard, including Costa Rica, Malaysia, the Philipines and Uruguay. \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD secretary-general, said: &quot;We now have an ambitious agenda, that I believe the OECD, working with other relevant organisations, is well placed to deliver on. I am confident that we can turn these new commitments into concrete actions which in turn would strengthen the integrity and transparency of the financial system.&quot; The list included China but not the financial centres of Hong Kong and Macau, the former British and Portuguese colonies, that were at the heart of the most serious row at the summit. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, had been pressing for every country \u2013 or in the case of the former colonies, every region \u2013 in the world to be included in the OECD list. But Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, succeeded in exempting Hong Kong and Macau from the list, though they will eventually be included. The two presidents sat next to each other at the G20 leaders&apos; dinner in Downing Street last night. But their more significant encounter came afterwards when they held a private bilateral meeting. Beijing only allowed the meeting to take place after Paris issued a statement moderating its position on Tibet. A diplomatic rift opened up between Paris and Beijing last year when Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama. In a statement France agreed not to back Tibetan independence in &quot;any form&quot;. Hu told Sarkozy that China was deeply sceptical about a tax haven blacklist. The Chinese president also indicated his unease that it would be monitored by the Paris-based OECD. Britain believes that progress has been made in clamping down on tax havens even in the run-up to the G20 summit. Only yesterday Revenue &amp; Customs officials were in Liechtenstein discussing ways of drawing up a tax exchange agreement. Gordon Brown believes that the fact of the G20 summit has persuaded many tax havens, such as Switzerland and Liechtenstein, to indicate that they will adopt a more open approach. Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said: &quot;I very much welcome the remarkable progress we have seen in tackling the problem of tax havens, of inappropriate banking secrecy over the last few months. The era of banking secrecy is over.&quot; But Timms warned that tax havens that fail to clean up will face sanctions. &quot;I am expecting there to be sanctions against countries that don&apos;t sign up \u2026 the OECD has put in place longstanding internationally agreed standards. Our view has long been that jurisdictions need to sign up to those standards.&quot; &quot;There is an important issue about transparency here because it is clear that the fact that some activities were hidden away in some jurisdictions where there wasn&apos;t any transparency \u2026 that opaqueness has contributed to the severity of the problems we are seeing in the world economy at the moment.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 3 April 2009.

The threat alone that the world&apos;s leaders gathering in London this week might finger tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions as guilty parties at the heart of the collapse of the financial system has produced progress of sorts. Yesterday&apos;s decision by the G20 leaders that tax havens that refuse to co-operate with other countries will immediately be named and shamed by the OECD showed how right they were to worry.  It has been fashionable among some pundits to say offshore havens were peripheral to the collapse of the financial system, a distraction in the business of reregulating the markets and the banks. Gordon Brown made clear yesterday that the world&apos;s leaders rightly thought otherwise. Banking secrecy and tax dodging have to be tackled in any rewriting of the rules for 21st-century capitalism. An estimated $11.5tn of personal wealth is held offshore. The deregulation of finance in the last decades has seen an enormous transfer of wealth to these jurisdictions.  Using the world&apos;s havens to cut your corporate tax bill to the minimum rather than contributing to the exchequers of the countries where you employ labour, use resources or sell your goods, has become the norm. The Guardian&apos;s Tax Gap series has documented in recent weeks how banks have tied up billions of pounds of capital in loans to each other in complex transactions through tax havens in order to avoid tax. These billions have not generated any real economic benefit; they have instead been used to cut the tax bills of big finance. Desperate to avoid being named and shamed by the OECD for refusing to co-operate with the rest of the world&apos;s tax authorities, and possibly face sanctions, these historically secretive states have suddenly begun negotiating agreements to share information on the bank accounts they hold when the tax inspectors demand it.  Jersey, Monaco, Switzerland, Singapore, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein all shifted their positions on banking secrecy in the run-up to the G20 summit. Even the Cayman Islands rushed to make an announcement this week that it would improve transparency.  That will be welcomed by the 60 or more aid organisations, unions, and church groups who have campaigned for a clampdown on tax dodging. But in many ways the fight only begins here.  It is true that many of the super-rich who have been able to hide their wealth for so long will draw their cheques a little less easily as a result of yesterday&apos;s announcement. Criminals who have used tax havens for money-laundering and corrupt rulers who have used them to siphon off wealth may find themselves more exposed as agreements to exchange tax information kick in.  Sharing information on tax and bank accounts is the vital first step to tackling evasion and fraud. But, just as significant, and largely untouched by yesterday&apos;s deal, is the vast tax avoidance industry. This industry doesn&apos;t just hide behind the odd offshore bank account. It manipulates sophisticated accounting rules and elaborate networks of corporate entities to enable big corporations and banks to make hundreds of millions of profits from tax avoidance. Many of the jurisdictions it uses are &quot;onshore&quot;, in countries that would never expect to find themselves on an OECD list of blacklisted tax haven states.  Governments have a historic opportunity to impose new rules on banks that now depend on them for bailouts and guarantees. The G20 pronouncements suggest that at last tax havens are top of the agenda. But the work of regulating their use and abuse has only just begun. felicity.lawrence@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/04/g20-bankers-pay", "sentences": ["&quot;This will drive talent out of the industry because if we regulate in London, but not in the Middle East or Singapore, people will go elsewhere,&quot; Prest said."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-03T23:01:00Z", "title": "Bankers rage at G20 'witch hunt' against bonuses and buccaneers", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Banking", "Regulators", "Financial crisis", "G20", "Business", "Pay", "Money", "UK news"], "article": "Bankers and hedge fund managers were furious yesterday at attempts by the G20 to cap their pay and regulate them for the first time, calling it a &quot;witch hunt&quot; by world leaders.  &quot;Regulation is generally bad.

Bankers are furious about the possible collapse of a system that inflated their basic pay: thousands of City jobs pay between \u00a380,000 and \u00a3110,000 a year, with another \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000 from bonuses, whilst senior management enjoyed multi-million pound bonuses. &quot;Salaries in the banking and corporate finance world are not outrageous. The big reward is in the bonus,&quot; said Larry Schechter, a director at Schechter &amp; Co, a boutique investment bank in Mayfair. &quot;I am not a proponent of arbitrary compensation restrictions. I believe that bonuses - the rewards - should be commensurate with the level of success. You cannot have the whip without the carrot, and vice versa.&quot;  The G20 wants to restrict compensation that rewards short term risk-taking. Investment bankers banks received bonuses for taking big bets in the markets that may have led to longer term losses.  Many bought complex derivative contracts that proved to be worthless and now count among the toxic assets sitting on banks&apos; balance sheets. They lent millions to companies that cannot repay their loans and must lay off thousands of staff.  &quot;While I do not believe in rewards for failure, I do not think it is right for good, successful bankers and corporate finance executives to be shot for the sins of others,&quot; Schechter said. &quot;The free market economy is based on risk versus reward and if you remove the incentive, then you run the risk of removing the creativity.&quot; Bankers say their bonuses contributed to tax income and were spent on cars, restaurants or homes that indirectly created other jobs. Those who flew from New York to London over recent years as the capital established itself as the world&apos;s financial centre, may now move east if bonus caps limit the attraction of the west.  &quot;This will drive talent out of the industry because if we regulate in London, but not in the Middle East or Singapore, people will go elsewhere,&quot; Prest said.  Still, banks may find a way around the new regulation. They have already started increasing salaries, sometimes doubling or trebling them to make up for the lack of bonuses. Car, home or holiday allowances may be an alternative, although cash remains the preferred option as it gives &quot;choices,&quot; a banker said. Few bankers argue with bonus caps imposed on part-nationalised institutions. &quot;Compensation should be a combination of short term, long term and company performance,&quot; said a credit analyst at a top investment bank. &quot;But in a dreadful year, you ought not to pay excessively.&quot; Hedge funds have received a double hit from the G20. Apart from possible restrictions on pay, they will also face tough regulation. Some 8,000 hedge funds around the world control assets worth about $1tn and are usually registered in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands or places with lower registration requirements, including the Irish Republic.  In Europe, hedge funds congregated in St James&apos;s, London, perhaps employing two people and a few screens to buy and sell assets according to complex mathematical models. They have been accused of provoking chaos by betting bank shares would fall, causing prices to drop further. Funds will now have to disclose their positions to a regulator. &quot;It&apos;s a witch hunt,&quot; said a newly-redundant hedge fund manager. &quot;When you look at things in reality, the problem was at banks that are regulated, that&apos;s where the tax money is going. Hedge funds haven&apos;t required injections of capital - why do you need to regulate something that hasn&apos;t caused any problem?&quot; Hedge funds and credit derivatives - where the G20 will also impose tighter controls - exploded over recent years, creating a shadow economy that contrasted with the regulation of banks and other financial institutions. New rules will shed light over the whole system, analysts say. &quot;More regulation and tighter risk controls of systematically large hedge funds will ultimately lead to a stronger financial system,&quot; said Vivek Tawadey, head of credit portfolio strategy at BNP Paribas. Hedge funds may profit from more regulated system that brings confidence back to the market and clients. &quot;The hedge fund industry is going through a shake up after a disappointing 2008, facing risk aversion from clients and new regulation,&quot; said Huw van Steenis, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. &quot;Investors want, more than ever, absolute returns. For those firms who can deliver absolute returns there will be strong demand.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/07/george-soros-zombie-banks", "sentences": ["Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei index edged down 0.3% to 8832.85 while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng fell 1.1% and Singapore&apos;s Straits Times index was down 2.1%."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T07:44:52Z", "title": "George Soros warns 'zombie' banks could suck lifeblood out of economy", "tags": ["US economy", "Financial crisis", "Banking", "Investing", "Investments", "Banks and building societies", "Business", "Money", "Global recession", "Recession", "US news", "World news", "George Soros"], "article": "Billionaire investor George Soros has warned that bailing out banks could turn them into &quot;zombies&quot; that suck the lifeblood of the American economy, which he predicted is in for a &quot;lasting slowdown&quot;.

His gloomy verdict weighed on Asian stockmarkets today, alongside a report that the International Monetary Fund now estimates that the toxic debts racked up by banks and insurers could spiral to $4tn (\u00a32.7tn). Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei index edged down 0.3% to 8832.85 while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng fell 1.1% and Singapore&apos;s Straits Times index was down 2.1%. However, the FTSE 100 index in London rose 33 points to 4027.15 in early trading. Soros said he does not expect the US economy to recover until next year at the earliest. &quot;The recovery will look like an inverted square root sign,&quot; he said. &quot;You hit bottom and you automatically rebound some, but then you don&apos;t come out of it in a V-shaped recovery or anything like that. You settle down, step down.&quot; His comments last night came after Morgan Stanley warned the bear market was not over. Its much followed strategy team led by Teun Draaisma moved its recommendation on equities from neutral to underweight. The team said in a note yesterday: &quot;We have to decide whether this is towards the end of another bear market rally that we should sell into now that hope has grown, or the start of a much larger advance, maybe even a new bull market. Our decision is to sell into strength now.&quot; Soros stressed that restoring health to the &quot;basically insolvent&quot; banking system and the housing market is key to any recovery. The public-private investment funds introduced to rid US banks of bad debts will work but won&apos;t be enough to recapitalise the banks so they can start lending again, he said. &quot;What we have created now is a situation where the banks will be able to earn their way out of a hole but by doing that, they are going to weigh on the economy,&quot; Soros said. &quot;Instead of stimulating the economy, they will draw the lifeblood, so to speak, of profits away from the real economy in order to keep themselves alive.&quot; Analysts agreed that the financial system remains a problem and thought recent optimism that the worst may be over was overdone. &quot;The market&apos;s stance on banks had been too optimistic recently,&quot; said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi Securities in Tokyo. &quot;Some large US banks have already passed stress tests, but others haven&apos;t, and given that results are coming up soon, this simply reignited investor uncertainty.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/07/g20-banking", "sentences": ["In recent weeks, there has been a surge of jurisdictions agreeing to share tax information to avoid being blacklisted by the G20, including Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T17:13:26Z", "title": "Blacklisted tax havens agree to implement OECD disclosure rules", "tags": ["Business", "G20", "Banking", "Switzerland", "World news", "Costa Rica", "Uruguay", "Europe", "Americas"], "article": "The last four countries on a blacklist of uncooperative tax havens published at the G20 London summit last week have succumbed to international pressure and agreed to cooperate with tax authorities around the world. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development announced in Paris todaythat Uruguay, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Malaysia are now committed to meeting its standards on exchanging tax information and would be removed from the blacklist. However, a row over how the OECD lists were drawn up and complaints from aid agencies that the agreements could be too easily circumvented threatened to overshadow the announcement. The dramatic shift in position by the four blacklisted countries marked a &quot;very, very substantial transformation of the landscape&quot; in tackling tax evasion and avoidance, OECD secretary general Angel Gurria said. In recent weeks, there has been a surge of jurisdictions agreeing to share tax information to avoid being blacklisted by the G20, including Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, and Singapore. They have been moved on to a &quot;grey list&quot; of countries that have pledged to implement tax standards but have not yet done so. But Luxembourg, Switzerland and Belgium have complained about being included on the &quot;grey list&quot; and challenged the categorisations of the UK, US and China on a &quot;white list&quot; of jurisdictions that cooperate fully on tax. Swiss president Hans-Rudolf Merz said that Switzerland was &quot;not a tax haven&quot; and that the OECD list was regrettable.Luxembourg&apos;s prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker questioned why the US, which has several states such as Delaware that effectively function as tax havens, should be on a white list and why the UK was also classified as fully cooperative despite tax abuses that used the Isle of Man and Channel Islands. The OECD&apos;s reluctance to name the \u00adChinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong except in a footnote was also \u00adcriticised by those on the grey list. Campaigners for tax justice welcomed the developments on tax havens but said that the moves marked only the beginning of an end to banking secrecy. David McNair, Christian Aid adviser said: &quot;the burden of proof required for poor countries to obtain information on tax dodgers is incredibly onerous. We urgently need a system open to all countries, for the automatic exchange tax information.&quot; Asked why the Swiss government still maintained that it would preserve banking secrecy even though it had committed to the OECD agreements, Gurria said that exchanging tax information did not mean countries could go &quot;on fishing expeditions&quot; for details about the tax affairs of residents of other countries. &quot;A country can still refuse to give information if it believes that the receiving country would not respect confidentiality. The goal is not to have names plastered on the front pages of newspapers, the aim is to make people pay the taxes they should pay,&quot; he added. The OECD monitors 84 countries and territories, only 40 of which are on the white list. The rest, ranging from the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean to Monaco, are under increasing pressure to provide more information to international authorities to prevent people from evading taxes or hiding income by shifting money to such places. Jeffrey Owens, director of the OECD&apos;s center for tax policy, defended the list, saying it is &quot;based on objective criteria.&quot; The G20 countries threatened the use of sanctions against blacklisted tax havens in their communiqu\u00e9 last week. Potential sanctions for transgressors include extra audits of those who use tax havens and curbs on tax deductions claimed by businesses using the territories. Mr Gurria distanced himself from the sanctions, saying they are set by governments and the OECD would not like to see one of its members impose them on another."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/07/gm-segway-electric-scooter-unveiled", "sentences": ["He said London, Paris, Abu Dhabi and Singapore would be likely candidates for the vehicle, as would Indianapolis, Atlanta and Washington in the United States."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T17:24:47Z", "title": "GM backs electric scooter but may drop Hummer", "tags": ["General Motors", "Automotive industry", "Environment", "US news", "US economy", "Global recession", "Credit crunch", "Obama administration", "Corporate social responsibility", "Travel and transport", "Ecotowns", "Ethical and green living", "US politics"], "article": "General Motors and Segway unveiled a prototype two-seat electric scooter today, intended to ease urban congestion and pollution and help GM recast itself as environmentally progressive and technologically innovative. The vehicle, named Puma (for Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility), is the product of an unlikely collaboration between an ailing American industrial behemoth known for manufacturing gas-guzzlers and a privately held company founded on technological wizardry. The companies have no plans as yet to mass produce the vehicle and offer it for sale, instead characterising today&apos;s announcement as a demonstration of technology. &quot;It&apos;s a directional statement that we&apos;re making ... an urban transportation we need to reinvent how we move people around in cities and towns,&quot; Segway president and chief executive officer, Jim Norrod, said in an interview. The announcement comes eight days after President Barack Obama challenged General Motors and Chrysler to &quot;restructure, to modernise, and to make themselves more competitive&quot;. At the same time, Obama fired GM&apos;s chairman and chief executive, Rick Wagoner, who had failed to stem a long-term decline in the company&apos;s US sales and whom Obama said lacked vision to take the company forward. General Motors has already received $15bn (\u00a310bn) in bailout loans from the taxpayer, and Obama demanded last week that the company devise a radical restructuring plan if it hopes to receive more funds. General Motors and Segway began talks on the project 18 months ago, before the taxpayer bailout, but the company was keen today to promote the Puma as a symbol of the company&apos;s break from tradition. &quot;Imagine small, nimble electric vehicles that know where other moving objects are and avoid running into them,&quot; said GM&apos;s vice-president of research and development, Larry Burns. Meanwhile, the company has signalled that it may jettison its Hummer brand, the massive, much-loathed military-style vehicles. The new vehicle can hit a top speed of about 35 miles an hour and its lithium-ion battery system gives it a range of 35 miles, the company said. A full recharge for the vehicle takes between eight and 10 hours, but uses only 40 pence worth of power. &quot;We think 35 miles in a city is pretty reasonable to do in a day,&quot; Norrod said. &quot;Then you get back and you charge it overnight, and we think that&apos;s sufficient.&quot; The company has not tested the vehicle in poor weather or on terrain rougher than pavements. The company said in a statement that it had &quot;no current plans to offer it for sale&quot; and did not suggest a price range but added that &quot;it&apos;s probably less than most current small car prices&quot;. Norrod said mass production would depend on whether cities created the necessary infrastructure \u2013 &quot;bike lanes could be a good start,&quot; he said. He said London, Paris, Abu Dhabi and Singapore would be likely candidates for the vehicle, as would Indianapolis, Atlanta and Washington in the United States. The vehicle rides on two side-by-side wheels, but like the $5,000 stand-up Segway on the market since 2002, the Puma stabilises and balances itself. It boasts a zero turning-radius, making it easy to squeeze into tight parking spots. The vehicle&apos;s appearance, which resembles a double-width wheelchair with a windscreen canopy, drew sniggers on its first outing. &quot;How would you imagine a guy picking you up at your place in that thing?&quot; a CNN anchorman, TJ Holmes, asked a woman colleague, with a chuckle."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/09/buddhist-film-festival-depp-mcgregor", "sentences": ["The six-year-old International Buddhist Film Festival arrives in London for the first time next month after appearances at cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Singapore and Mexico City."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-08T23:01:00Z", "title": "Johnny Depp and Ewan McGregor films to be shown at Buddhist festival", "tags": ["Film", "Buddhism", "Religion", "UK news", "World news", "Culture"], "article": "They might have been mildly surprised to be invited along, but a Ewan McGregor psychological thriller, a Johnny Depp psychedelic western, and one of the more cultish of recent cult movies, Donnie Darko, are all to be part of the UK&apos;s first Buddhist film festival. The six-year-old International Buddhist Film Festival arrives in London for the first time next month after appearances at cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Singapore and Mexico City. For 10 days, the Barbican will play host to more than 40 films, from the clearly Buddhist to some without such an obvious connection. The festival&apos;s executive director, Gaetano Kazuo Maida, admitted some of the Buddhist references might be oblique, not least Donnie Darko, the Jim Jarmusch-directed Dead Man (with Depp) and Stay, starring McGregor and directed by Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster. All three will be part of a Mind the Gap strand, focusing on the Buddhist concept of bardo, the state between one life and the next. There will be more directly Buddhist films such as Milarepa by Neten Chokling Rinpoche, a film director who is also a lama. There will also be profiles of the singer Leonard Cohen, who was a zen monk for a decade, and the Buddhist-influenced composer Philip Glass, who once described himself as a &quot;Jewish-Taoist-Hindu-Toltec-Buddhist&quot;. Maida said the festival organisers had scoured the world for films and this year 18 countries will be represented, including Argentina, Hungary, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. The opening film has been squirrelled out of the BFI archive - a 1925 German-Indian silent called Prem Sanyas, or The Light of Asia, which tells the story of Prince Siddhartha Gautama and his journey to becoming Buddha. It will be accompanied by live music on the sitar, tabla, flute and violin. Maida said he was not expecting a mass conversion of London audiences. &quot;Our hope is that these films offer folks an opportunity to see things just a little differently.&quot; The London visit has come about through the Robert HN Ho Foundation, which sent two representatives to Mexico with a view to bringing this year&apos;s festival to London.

Dozens of giant ships would be bobbing in the swell at any one time - queueing to enter the port of Long Beach, laden not with GIs but with containers full of Chinese consumer goods bound for American shops. During the long boom, congestion at this key gateway often got so bad that cargo ships would be sent through the Panama Canal to ports on the east coast as America physically ran out of capacity to absorb Asia&apos;s manufactured goods. Now this physical manifestation of all that was wrong with the global trade imbalance is reversed: an armada of container ships is moored on the other side of the Pacific, this time outside the port of Singapore. Only these ships are mothballed and empty - each one a giant relic to the unsustainable American trade deficit which contributed greatly to the credit crisis. Yesterday&apos;s trade figures tell a dramatically changed story. The February US trade deficit has plunged to its lowest level in almost 10 years and the port of Long Beach has seen a staggering 30% collapse in inbound container traffic. On the other side of the ocean, exports from China and Japan are sinking like a stone as US shoppers react to the threat of unemployment by boycotting the shopping mall. The continued collapse in world trade is a major reason why we are not through the worst of it yet. The financial storm may have calmed, but its effects on the rest of the economy are only just beginning. Indeed, the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of demand for global shipping that was recently held up as a sign of optimism because it was finally recovering, has now started plunging again. It&apos;s not all doom and gloom, though. One legacy of the long boom is plenty of surplus industrial capacity (and shipping). This means jobs cuts and pain, but it also means we are a long way from price rises again. Home front relief If you want to know why what happens in the ports of Long Beach and Singapore matters to you, look at a rare bit of good news that broke through on the home front yesterday. At the same time as holding interest rates at historic lows, the Bank of England announced that rates on fixed-rate mortgages had fallen to their lowest level in six years. The link ought to be natural, but until recently the banking crisis had made it hard for home buyers to feel the benefit of previous rate cuts. Now, despite the concerns I outlined yesterday about its policy of quantitative easing, this aspect of Bank policy at least seems to be beginning to work.  Cuts in interest rates are filtering through to home buyers at last - not just for variable loans but more importantly for longer-term fixed loans that allow prospective buyers to plan ahead.  Without the deflationary effect of all that unused global industrial capacity holding down interest rates, this would not be possible. It is, of course, a long way from this to a fully fledged recovery in the housing market, but the renewed confidence shown by certain banks, such as HSBC and Barclays, in moving to try to take market-share off their troubled rivals is slowly freeing up the wheels of finance in the mortgage market.  HSBC alone has announced \u00a31bn of new lending, aimed primarily at first-time buyers. One swallow does not make a spring, but if you are looking for some good news to encourage the Easter house buyers and shoppers, this is probably as good as it gets. Tough call At the other end of the spectrum, spare a thought for the Wall Street analyst who has just had to make the toughest phone call to his boss. Credit rating agency Moody&apos;s has decided to downgrade one of the icons of US capitalism: Warren Buffett&apos;s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. One of Berkshire&apos;s many investments is in Moody&apos;s itself. Buffett insists he never interferes in the work of his subsidiaries, but Moody&apos;s usually consults widely with companies before it initiates a downgrade of their debt. Since Berkshire Hathaway is famously frugal, and gets by with barely more than a dozen staff in an office in Omaha, it is quite likely that the Moody&apos;s analyst would have had to deal with the great man himself before cutting him down to size. Buffett has fessed up to making a number of big investment mistakes, but he is still sitting on one of the biggest piles of unspent cash in the world and has veered away from any reliance on debt. The real moral of this story is that if Berkshire Hathaway is no longer seen as a triple-A rated bet by its own credit rating agency, then nothing is certain.  dan.roberts@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/12/standard-chartered-payoff-butalia", "sentences": ["Although he oversaw Standard Chartered&apos;s private equity business around the globe, his six years at the bank saw him based in Singapore and working predominantly on Asian-focused leveraged buyout deals."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-12T18:26:03Z", "title": "Standard banker earns \u00a316m payoff", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Private equity", "UK news"], "article": "Karam Butalia, former head of Standard Chartered&apos;s private equity operations, has received a departing pay package worth \u00a316m, making him one of the best-paid executives to have worked for a London-listed bank last year.

Nearly 200,000 offshore students studied for qualifications from 112 British universities last year, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), earning the sector more than \u00a3268m in fees. British universities have long relied on the roughly \u00a32.5bn that overseas students bring when they come to the UK to study, but the new figures reveal for the first time the extent to which students are taking UK higher education qualifications overseas. With student numbers at home restricted by the government, many British universities are looking to expand their offshore operations to reach a potentially enormous market of students seeking the prestige of a UK degree but without the means to travel abroad. Liverpool University has set up a joint university with Xian Jiaotong, in China, that awards its degrees. Kalvin Everest, director of academic affairs, said: &quot;The UK system is small in global terms, with very high quality teaching and research. Lots of students will want to come to the UK, but we need to take what we offer to other countries as well. There&apos;s an incredible undersupply of providers given the demand out there in the world.&quot; The University of London and the Open University have the longest established distance learning courses, and educate the bulk of offshore students \u2013 63,140 of the 166,000 doing English university courses. Several of the newer universities are ahead of the game \u2013 Herriot-Watt, Middlesex and Northumbria are all in the top 15. At Northumbria, which has run distance-learning programmes for the last 10 years, Prof Craig Mahoney, deputy vice-chancellor (learning and teaching), said: &quot;We charge a maximum of \u00a32,300 for a course. It&apos;s not about income generation, it&apos;s about offering educational opportunities regardless of their location. &quot;We want to expand this work because it&apos;s more cost effective for students to stay in situ without the dislocation, expense and trauma of living in the UK.&quot; Liverpool University runs online masters programmes, charging between \u00a38,000 and \u00a312,000 depending on the subject. Everest said the university was very selective about who it takes on to programmes and uses the external examiner system in the UK to maintain standards. The 2007-08 figures show that more than half of offshore students were on distance learning courses (100,360), while 7,090 were at overseas campuses run by British universities. Most of the remaining 89,190 students were studying for qualifications offered by UK institutions in collaboration with foreign partners. The majority studied undergraduate courses, with just under a third taking postgraduate qualifications. Nearly a quarter of offshore students (23%) studied in other European Union countries, while 45% studied in Asia. Between 8,000 and 10,000 students studied for UK qualifications in Greece, Russia, Ireland and Trinidad and Tobago. Four countries \u2013 Hong Kong (21,280 students), Singapore (20,845), Malaysia (20,525) and China (10,450) \u2013 accounted for 37% of offshore provision between them. This compares with the 45,355 Chinese students and 25,905 Indian students that came to the UK to study in 2007-08. Post-92 universities represented by the Million+ group teach 70,000 overseas students on their UK campuses and roughly 50,000 &quot;offshore students&quot;. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of Million+, said: &quot;Transnational education is an important export to UK plc. In fact, our report found that \u00a347m is generated by non-UK students studying on HE-level award programmes outside of the UK.&quot; The British Council estimated that the UK made \u00a3500 per student from twinning arrangements, joint programmes and franchises in 2003-04, compared with \u00a32,706 from programmes on overseas campuses and \u00a32,040 for distance-learning programmes.

Chowringhee has that essential quality of a good novel: the capacity to escape, and help the reader escape, time. You want to turn the pages, but you do not want the pages to end. The words are fresh, and the world of the novel is completely alive, despite being written over 40 years ago.  First published in Bengali in 1962, the novel became a bestseller and was translated into a number of Indian languages and made into a film and a play. But it has taken until now for it to be published in English outside India. Below the radar when Salman Rushdie surveyed the scene for his 1997 anthology, The Vintage Book of Indian Writing, it did not surface even for Amit Chaudhuri&apos;s later Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature, which begins with a large section on Bengali writing. Perhaps Sankar was too popular to be noted, even though two of his other books, Seemabaddha (Company Limited) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) had the accolade of being filmed by the legendary Satyajit Ray.  In a recent interview Sankar explains how he discovered Chowringhee, Calcutta&apos;s glittering esplanade and the world of his novel. From being a street hawker and a typewriter cleaner, by luck he became a clerk to India&apos;s last British lawyer, Noel Barwell. &quot;I was 17 and in constant awe of Noel. But he treated me like a friend and exposed me to the &apos;high life&apos; of the rich and famous. I used to stay at [the hotel] Shahjahan&apos;s servants&apos; quarters as his employee. I had a greenroom view of cabaret dancers, the private lives of celebrities ... &quot; After Barwell died, Mani Sankar Mukherji became Sankar the writer.  The book is a banquet of stories served by a wide-eyed narrator, rather confusingly named Shankar and shaped by the hotel he comes to work in, the same Shahjahan. Although one of the characters tells us, &quot;At least a dozen novels about hotels are written in this country every year,&quot; I am not aware of another. There ought to be hundreds of them. The Shahjahan has cousins scattered around the world: the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo, Raffles in Singapore, the Peace Hotel in Shanghai, Reid&apos;s Palace in Madeira - hotels that nurture history and the memories of their guests and slowly develop a character of their own. You would expect them to loom large in modern fiction, given the number of writers who have stayed in them, but Shahjahan does seem to be surprisingly alone. &quot;It wasn&apos;t so much a hotel as a framed picture. In the alluring curves was not the arrogance of modern skyscrapers but the stamp of ancient aristocracy. Like a beautiful bride&apos;s bracelet, the neon light glinted in the darkness. It had three bands - green at the extremities and red in the middle; the flirtatious winking was limited to the green, while the red was like the unblinking eye ... &quot; Shankar is also refreshingly different. He begins as a babu who &quot;revelled in the role ... the lawyer&apos;s clerk&quot;. He&apos;s happy to salute Curzon, &quot;the English Lord, much maligned by history&quot;, on the first page and, at the end of the novel, quote Kipling in another ancient Calcutta hotel, railing against the sham of life. In between he quotes lines from other poets who are not identified but were perhaps obvious, as were the real-life models for some of the characters, to Calcutta readers in the 1960s. But other than a tendency to hyperbole in the early pages, Shankar does not inflict babu speech on the reader. Although many of the conversations take place in English there are none of the distractions of clever linguistics and forced humour with which babu characters so often burst the bubble of fiction and hurl us out of a story. Perhaps this is an unexpected consequence of the book having been written in Bengali. The early history of modern Bengali literary writing is said to have been a negotiation between a formal high style and the liveliness of everyday speech. Buddhadeb Bose, writing in 1948 on the impact of Tagore and Pramatha Chaudhuri, identifies the &quot;War of Words&quot;, a &quot;battle that raged over the new style of prose&quot;. Everyday spoken Bengali, which both these writers promoted, was regarded as too lightweight by the establishment of the time. But by the mid-century, Bose writes, &quot;The quality and quantity of our recent spoken-tongue prose indicate that though Pramatha Chaudhuri broke the ice, Rabindranath set the stream flowing.&quot; Chowringhee is perhaps a part of that flow. The writing is natural and uncluttered. The translation is transparent and one questions it only rarely over the odd phrase or image. Shankar is despondent on the death of his English employer. Then he stumbles into a job behind the reception desk of the Shahjahan, thanks to the help of a magnanimous but failing detective, Byron, whose client is the hotel manager Marco Polo (first seen in a &quot;sleeveless vest and tiny red briefs&quot;). Immediately we get an inkling that we are stepping into a Calcutta that offers rather more than the standard dal and masala fare. As it turns out, dal barely gets a mention in 400 pages, and that&apos;s after tutti frutti ice-cream - a delight in itself.  Shankar&apos;s first task is to type out 50 breakfast menu cards. Jimmy, the steward, &quot;a veritable Mount Vesuvius&quot;, barks out the list: &quot;Strange words, some of which I had never heard before, assailed my ears: chilled pineapple juice, rice crisps, eggs - boiled, fried, poached, scrambled. The man stopped for a while, gulped, and then continued yelling in the manner of reciting a multiplication table: omelette - prawns, cheese, tomato ... and so on. Words came tumbling out of his mouth like gunfire as he came to a halt with &apos;coffee&apos;.&quot; Jimmy, like Marco Polo, is European, but in the cosmopolitan world of 1950s Calcutta, this is an unimportant detail that we discover late in the book, when the new Indian owners of the Shahjahan decide to keep the management foreign but modernise the hotel. In the end, the old Goan musician Gomez, with his love of Beethoven and Mozart, has to make way for a &quot;more cheerful&quot; band, and Shankar&apos;s contract is terminated because &quot;they&apos;re going to have only girls at the counter&quot;. But between those first breakfast menu cards and the farewell banquet we waltz into a world of Moscow mules and Manhattans, honeymoon soup and sharkskin suits. We meet Connie, a stripper from Scotland via Persia, whose dance ends with her clothed only in bursting balloons; Karabi, a hostess who services suite number 2, permanently booked for corporate hospitality; Sutherland, the WHO expert with a secret past; as well as tycoons, politicians and conscience-stricken bartenders. Karabi&apos;s dilemma of having to choose between old and new values is one that most of the characters face at some point in their time at Shahjahan, including Marco Polo and Bose-da, his right-hand man, the fount of Shahjahan lore and fixer of high-society liaisons. Shankar learns to become the trusted servant of them all.  The servant&apos;s tale, from Canterbury to Calcutta, Bangalore to Bath, often veers between anger and loss. Shankar&apos;s story in the end is one of loss: &quot;When I had checked in here, it was filled with known and familiar faces. Some left after breakfast; a few disappeared after lunch; others went away after tea. Now it was time for dinner, and no one was left ... I, the patriarch, seemed to have sat down at an empty table.&quot; Not quite true for his creator. Sankar, the writer, at the end, has Chowringhee: a lovely, charming book brimming with life and full of the unexpectedness of a closely observed world. Everything comes to the old hotel, either to the sumptuous guest rooms or to the terrace where the staff live. Love and death are never far away. Sankar writes of both simply and movingly. There will be many grateful readers at his table.  \u2022 Romesh Gunesekera&apos;s most recent novel is The Match (Bloomsbury)"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/19/fifa-fashion-label", "sentences": ["The first such store opened at Changi airport in Singapore last year and another is planned for Paris in September."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-18T23:01:00Z", "title": "Fifa to tackle own fashion label", "tags": ["Business", "Football", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "article": "If you automatically link football shirts with &quot;wearing your colours&quot; on match days, it is time for a rethink.

Sudhir Choudhrie, who has personally donated \u00a395,000 to the party and whose relatives&apos; companies have donated a further \u00a3475,000, was named as a key arms broker in foreign reports. The allegations have been rejected by Choudhrie, an Indian citizen based in Chelsea, west London. A source close to the family denies that he has ever profited from the arms industry.  This is the second time that Choudhrie, 59, has been accused of being paid an illegal commission from a major arms deal in India. The allegations are said to be politically motivated, and to coincide with the country&apos;s general election.  The timing of the allegations is embarrassing for Nick Clegg, the party leader, who called for a curb of the arms trade and a boycott of sales of arms to Israel earlier this year. The claims that one of their donors is an arms broker will concern senior Liberal Democrats, who are still smarting from the exposure of their biggest ever donor, Michael Brown, as a convicted serial fraudster in 2006.  The party may yet be forced by the Electoral Commission to pay back \u00a32.4m it received from Brown&apos;s non-trading company, 5th Avenue Partners, and is awaiting the outcome of an inquiry.  The Mumbai-based newspaper DNA has alleged that Choudhrie was paid a share of \u00a380.5m in illegal business charges from the sale of medium-range surface-to-air missiles by an Israeli company to the Indian government.  Payments were supposedly part of a \u00a31.3bn deal struck in January between the Indian defence ministry and the arms company Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), DNA claimed. The use of middle men to facilitate an arms deal is banned under Indian law. Choudhrie was also named as a key broker between the Israel defence industry and India by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz Indian police are investigating the deal, according to media reports. The businessman was previously implicated in a police inquiry into kickbacks from another Indian arms deal with the same Israeli company, in 2006, but Choudhrie was not charged with any offence.  An Indian Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry revealed that Choudhrie and his companies &quot;received a number of suspected remittances to the tune of millions of dollars from IAI Israel during the year 1998 to 2001&quot;. It suggested that IAI had a close relationship with two of Choudhrie&apos;s companies - Magnum International Trading Co and Eureka Sales Corporation. Sources close to the family believe that Choudhrie is the victim of a campaign to discredit him. &quot;These allegations, as well as the ones from earlier, are completely and utterly unfounded. He has never been involved in arms deals of any sort,&quot; said a source.  &quot;He did have a role in Magnum but the company was involved in the export of tea and car parts, while Eureka was involved in building ships in Singapore. The confusion may have arisen because an Israeli company that Magnum once had business links with later became an arms company,&quot; he added.  Choudhrie is believed to have moved to Britain in 2002 with his wife and lives in a \u00a34m apartment in Chelsea. He first donated \u00a350,000 to the Lib Dems in August 2006 and has followed this up with payments of \u00a325,000 and \u00a320,000.  Two companies controlled by Choudhrie&apos;s son Bhanu and his nephew Dhruv - Alpha Healthcare and C&amp;C Business Solutions - have donated a total of \u00a3475,000 to the Lib Dems.  Choudhrie and his son are known to be non domiciled for tax purposes and base many of their business interests in tax havens, where businesses do not have to declare their accounts publicly.

Because Gaunt is about to launch an online radio version of The Sun. It goes live at 10am today.  9.59am: The Sun website says its online radio station - SunTalk - goes live at 10am. Except you can already here Gaunt chatting to his special guest David Cameron. I&apos;m just not sure they realise they&apos;re on air. &quot;We&apos;ve had about a thousand emails over the weekend,&quot; Gaunt tells Cameron as a snapper takes pictures in the background. &quot;If they are still in bold it means you haven&apos;t read them.&quot; Whoops.  10.06am: We&apos;re off! With a slightly cheesy but very commercial radio theme tune, it&apos;s Gaunty! He&apos;s back! &quot;Is David Cameron ready to be the next leader of our great country?&quot; he asks. Very possibly, we&apos;re about to find out. Also coming up: Ally Ross, Trevor Kavanagh, George Pascoe-Watson, and the page 3 girls. &quot;Not all at once!&quot; says Gaunty. No, that would be awful. &quot;It&apos;s a revolution in radio. The phonelines are already in meltdown.&quot; That was quick. If you were thinking about ringing, it&apos;s 020 33 64 7000.  10.15am: &quot;Am I your first guest or victim?&quot; asks Cameron. &quot;Let&apos;s kick off with a bit of a hard one,&quot; says Gaunty, with his first listener email. &quot;Please ask David Cameron if he intends to stick to full blooded Thatcherism, or is he his own man?&quot; Yep, a pretty hard one. Pam in Rugby is the first ever caller to SunTalk. &quot;Is he going to support to get our soldiers out of Afghanistan?&quot; Her son went off today to Afghanistan. &quot;I&apos;m going to have to disappoint you,&quot; says Cameron. &quot;I don&apos;t think the troops should come home.&quot;  10.15am: Gaunty is getting a little confused, giving out the TalkSport text number. Well, he did work there for a long time.  10.21am: It&apos;s the question on everybody&apos;s lips. Will David Cameron make St George&apos;s Day a public holiday? I have a hunch this might be an issue close to Gaunty&apos;s heart. Come on St George! &quot;I&apos;m not going to announce a new Bank Holiday on this radio station.&quot; Boo! &quot;Would you like to?&quot; asks Gaunty. &quot;There seems to be a clamour for it in the country.&quot; However, DC does announce a Bank Holiday review of sorts. If he gets into power. He has my vote.  10.27am: Ah, yes, this will be interesting. What does Cameron think about the whistleblower nurse who was sacked? Alas the Tory leader doesn&apos;t have an opinion - and ducks it entirely. &quot;I didn&apos;t follow every fact of this case. I have seen a little bit about it. I&apos;m not going to blag it on your show.&quot; And then Gaunt cuts to a jingle. Whaaaat? Probably not the sort of thing that would happen on Today.  10.34am: &quot;Are you ready for some more calls, prime minister?&quot; asks Gaunty. Is there a chance he might be a little right-leaning, do you think? Let&apos;s not get ahead of ourselves, says the Tory leader. &quot;Oh come on, behave yourself,&quot; says Gaunt. &quot;I bet you stand in front of the mirror wondering what it will be like to be prime minister?&quot; Which reminds me a little of the Alan Partridge episode when he quizzes a distant royal: &quot;Do you want to be Queen? Yes, she wants to be Queen!&quot;  10.39am: It&apos;s SunSport&apos;s Ian McGarry. &quot;Morning, prime minister.&quot; Crikey. He&apos;s at it as well. Have I missed something? So this is what they mean by the &quot;home of free speech&quot;. If this was a radio station licensed and regulated by Ofcom, then someone might have put a call in by now.  10.44am: Less than 20 minutes left if we&apos;re going to get a call from Rebekah in Wapping, Richard in Canary Wharf, or possibly Gaunty&apos;s old boss, Moz from TalkSport.  10.47am: Next up, a chap who unwittingly rented his house to the IRA, which was subsequently raided by the police and he&apos;s still awaiting compensation. &quot;Not really something we can deal with in the here and now,&quot; says Gaunty. I think that&apos;s probably fair enough.  10.52am: Cameron on the death of Ian Tomlinson: &quot;It&apos;s dangerous for politicians to dive in where there&apos;s a proper investigation taking place. When you watch the television and you see the thin blue line - or yellow line, as it is - and the huge surge of the demonstrators you realise the police do a really difficult job in incredibly stressful circumstances. They are there to protect us and keep the peace. We should think about that. The police know they have got to have the confidence of the public, we don&apos;t live in a police state. They have got to police with the consent of the public. They are our police, not the government&apos;s. They need to think about that.&quot;  10.53am: &quot;For all those of you who say you hate me, it&apos;s a bumper day for you,&quot; says Gaunty. &quot;There are four pages of me in the Sun. You can put it on the dartboard.&quot; &quot;Use it to light your fire,&quot; suggests Cameron. In case you missed it earlier, SunTalk is here. Ah, we&apos;re onto immigration. &quot;But there are a million illegals!&quot; suggests Gaunty. &quot;What are you going to do about them?&quot; Ah, yes. &quot;Illegals.&quot; Lovely noun.  11.07am: Another caller on Cameron: &quot;He&apos;s got a true face, some fair eyes, and I would vote for him anytime.&quot; Which just about sums up the tone of the programme so far. This ToryTalk programme is a triumph.  11.11am: It&apos;s Ally Ross! And he&apos;s got his own jingle. &quot;TV - with Ally Ross!&quot; Makes sense.  11.19am: Ross, one of the best things about the Sun, is impressively laid back. He likes the Apprentice, but he&apos;s not so keen on Ashes To Ashes, back on BBC1 tonight. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s because I have just been listening to you and David Cameron for an hour, but it was obsessively right on,&quot; says Ross. Gene Hunt, you see, has discovered his feminine side, and is no longer his un-PC self of old. &quot;They thought we were laughing at him, but in fact we were laughing with him,&quot; suggests Gaunt. &quot;That&apos;s what they don&apos;t like, the people who run the BBC.&quot; Bash the Beeb!  11.32am: The first page 3 contributor to SunTalk is Peta, although it&apos;s only in a trail suggesting we get in touch with SunTalk. Let&apos;s hope that&apos;s enough to sate all the page 3 fans out there. And the first ad. At least, I think it&apos;s an ad for the chap who wrote this. Not entirely sure how funny it is, though.  11.44am: It&apos;s Sun political editors old and new, Trevor Kavanagh and George Pascoe-Watson. &quot;Everyone knows that Labour is going to lose the next general election....&quot; Hmm, can you feel a subliminal message here? For those listeners who were not already aware, it does not cost any money to send an email to SunTalk, says Gaunt. Phonecalls are charged at a local rate. &quot;Not a premium rip off rate, as some stations charge, naming no names!&quot; says Gaunty. Let it go, Jon, let it go.  11.45am: &quot;The reason we want to be on the internet is because we want to be the home of free speech,&quot; explains Gaunty. &quot;We are not regulated by Ofcom, we are regulated by the Press Complaints Commission. We don&apos;t want people to libel anyone or any of that nonsense, we want people to talk from the heart. If we were a traditional radio station that would not be possible.&quot; What he&apos;s trying to say, I think, is that you can go a little bit further on the web. But not TOO far, obviously. But how far is too far?   11.48am: Ian McGarry&apos;s back, talking sport. McGarry: &quot;I don&apos;t agree that you can&apos;t please all the people, all the time.&quot; Gaunt: &quot;You&apos;ve not heard the phonecalls from your wife!&quot;  11.49am: As StephenDBrook suggests in a comment below, the Press Complaints Commission is going to have an interesting time regulating the likes of SunTalk. As Roy Greenslade asked earlier, what will the PCC do if Gaunt calls someone a Nazi on SunTalk radio?   11.56am: Gaunt isn&apos;t happy that some people say SunTalk isn&apos;t proper radio. &quot;People say it&apos;s not real radio, Gaunty. Was it not real radio when they got rid of valves? Was it not real radio when they introduced the dinosaur that is DAB radio? Wake up and smell the coffee. The internet is the way forward. We are the first in the world pioneering something completely different. Join in, you use it or you lose it.&quot; I&apos;m not sure the Sun is entirely pioneering when it comes to internet radio - there may be one or two out there at the moment - but we&apos;ll leave it there. &quot;Dinosaur that is DAB&quot;? He&apos;s obviously not read Stephen Carter&apos;s Digital Britain.  12.03pm: After an hour of David Cameron, and an hour of Sun columnist, after Sun columnist, after Sun columnist, the show could do with a little change of pace. Coming up - it&apos;s a Sun columnist, travel editor Lisa Minot. They could really do with a surprise celebrity guest to sparkle things up. Oh, hang on, Esther Rantzen&apos;s coming up. Will she do?  12.07pm: A classic call. &quot;Next up, it&apos;s Jim from Portsmouth.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s Tim, not Jim!&quot; &quot;Tim, not Jim, sorry... &quot; &quot;You&apos;re having David Cameron on the show later today...&quot; &quot;No, he&apos;s already been on.&quot; Next!  12.08pm: Ah, SunTalk is going to run a classified ads service, publicising people&apos;s local events, jumble sales, that kind of thing. Just get in touch and they&apos;ll make you up a jingle. Ads will help it sound more like a normal radio station - we&apos;ve only had one so far, for this chap, and it was even more irritating second time round than it was first. But are ads for jumble sales really the sort of thing we want to hear, I wonder.  12.13pm: Esther Rantzen&apos;s on, and we&apos;re talking cruising. &quot;You&apos;re a big fan?&quot; asks Gaunty. &quot;I am a huge fan, I am addicted.&quot; Apparently taking to the high seas has never been so popular, according to the Sun&apos;s travel editor and a chap from P&amp;O. Just don&apos;t use the laundrette, suggests Rantzen. People are always taking your underwear out and putting there&apos;s in. &quot;Do what I do, and wash them in the bath.&quot; Rantzen&apos;s undies in the bath? On a boat? The P&amp;O chap, presumably hoping for a few extra bookings out of this appearance, has just had his dreams shattered into a million tiny pieces.  12.16pm: Rantzen is listing where she&apos;s been on a cruise. My goodness - this is like Clement Freud on Just A Minute. Just not as funny. &quot;I&apos;ve been to the Arctic, I&apos;ve been all round the Med, I&apos;ve been to the Caribbean, I&apos;ve been whale watching, Singapore, across the ocean for six days, I went to Australia...&quot; Brnnng! Hesitation!  12.20pm: We&apos;re still talking cruising.  12.23pm: Gaunt: &quot;What&apos;s the attraction of a holiday where you can&apos;t get a sun tan?&quot;  12.25pm: &quot;P&amp;O is all British? You don&apos;t let the Germans on?&quot;  12.27pm: Gaunty remembers a sailing - I had no idea there was so much mileage in cruising - which was so rough the captain fell over. &quot;And there was a big fat bird trying to climb an upside down Christmas tree. I&apos;m making that bit up. That was the Poseidon Adventure.&quot; He&apos;s here all week, ladies and gentlemen. The extended advertorial, sorry, phone-in about cruising must surely hit dry dock soon.  12.34pm: Ian McGarry&apos;s back, but the cruising debate lingers on. Are you allowed to smoke on board? You&apos;ll know when I do. Any news happening in the world of sport? &quot;It&apos;s a very quiet morning.&quot; Oh. I wonder where SunTalk is going to nick its listeners from. TalkSport? BBC Radio 5 Live? Or your chatty BBC local radio station?  12.48pm: &quot;www.talksport... TalkSport! I knew I&apos;d say it today...&quot; That smoking on cruises query - you can smoke on the open deck, on the balcony of your cabin, and P&amp;O ships still have one smoking bar, apparently. So now you know. Next up - a caller who says her four-year-old child was sexually abused. That&apos;s quite a change of gear.  12.56pm: Gordon Smart&apos;s on, talking about his feud with Chris Moyles. That&apos;s the feud that started when Smart wrote in Saturday&apos;s Sun that Moyles will be axed from the Radio 1 breakfast show later this year. Young people don&apos;t listen to the radio in the morning anyway, says Gaunty, or is he an old fart? &quot;You&apos;re an old fart,&quot; says Smart. &quot;People are always going to listen to the radio in the morning, or on the way to school.&quot; Maybe they will listen to SunTalk.  12.59pm: It&apos;s nearly the end of the first show. &quot;Simon from the Independent&quot; has emailed in to correct a sports story featuring this particular woman. She&apos;s big in IndyCar in the US, apparently. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s this &quot;Simon from the Independent&quot;. Well, probably not, but you never know.  1.07pm: And then he was gone. You half expect a top of the hour news bulletin, but there isn&apos;t one. Not even a closing jingle, in fact. Tomorrow&apos;s guests will include Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, who came out in support of Gaunt when he was sacked by TalkSport, arguing that the &quot;airwaves of a great democracy would be the poorer for his absence&quot;. So a bit of history there, then. That and Gaunt once describing her as the &quot;most dangerous woman in Britain&quot;.  1.20pm: &quot;We&apos;ve put it together in six weeks. It sounds like it!&quot; jokes Gaunt. And it does a bit. For a phone-in show there were only a handful of phonecalls worth listening to. Gaunt is a consummate radio pro and hurries things along - sometimes too quickly, in fact - and had a big name guest in the shape of David Cameron. But once the prime minister, as Gaunt insisted on calling him, exited stage right, the programme lost any sense of occasion, with one Sun columnist turning up after another. Some of them were better value than others - we needed more Ally Ross and Gordon Smart, less P&amp;O travel guide, which felt like it lasted forever. I haven&apos;t checked my watch, but possibly it did. Gaunt&apos;s dedicated band of followers will enjoy it, I am sure, and if you agree with everything you read in the Sun, then you will appreciate most of the things you hear on SunTalk. But it could have done with a little bit more light and shade, a little bit of left with its right. Preaching to the converted can make for awfully boring radio. Strangely for a project that was so keen to big itself up as the &quot;home of free speech&quot; where people would &quot;talk from the heart&quot;, SunTalk played it safe."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/21/50-best-restaurants", "sentences": ["The world&apos;s 50 best restaurants 2009 (and 2008 ranking in brackets) 1 El Bulli, Spain (1) 2 The Fat Duck, UK (2) 3 Noma, Denmark (10) 4 Mugaritz, Spain (4) 5 El Celler de Can Roca, Spain (26) 6 Per Se, US (6) 7 Bras, France (7) 8 Arzak, Spain (8) 9 Pierre Gagnaire, France (3) 10 Alinea, US (21) 11 L&apos;Astrance, France (11) 12 The French Laundry, US (5) 13 Osteria Francescana, Italy (new entry) 14 St. John, UK (16) 15 Le Bernardin, US (20) 16 Restaurant de l&apos;Hotel de Ville, Switzerland (27) 17 Tetsuya&apos;s, Australia (9) 18 L&apos;Atelier de Joel Robuchon, France (14) 19 Jean Georges, US (17) 20 Les Creations de Narisawa, Japan (new entry) 21 Chez Dominique, Finland (39) 22 Ristorante Cracco, Italy (43) 23 Die Schwarzwaldstube, Germany (35) 24 D.O.M., Brazil (40) 25 Vendome, Germany (34) 26 Hof van Cleve, Belgium (28) 27 Masa, US (re-entry) 28 Gambero Rosso, Italy (12) 29 Oud Sluis, Netherlands (42) 30 Steirereck, Austria (new entry) 31 Momofuku Ssam Bar, US (new entry) 32 Oaxen Skargardskrog, Sweden (48) 33 Martin Berasategui, Spain (29) 34 Nobu, UK (30) 35 Mirazur, France (new entry) 36 Hakkasan, UK (19) 37 Le Quartier Francais, South Africa (5) 38 La Colombe, South Africa (re-entry) 39 Asador Etxbarri, Spain (44) 40 Le Chateaubriand, France (new entry) 41 Daniel, US (41) 42 Combal Zero, Italy (re-entry) 43 Le Louis XV, France (15) 44 Tantris, Germany (47) 45 Iggy&apos;s, Singapore (new entry) 46 Quay, Australia (new entry) 47 Les Ambassadeurs, France (45) 48 Dal Pescatore, Italy (23) 49 Le Calandre, Italy ( 36) 50 Mathias Dahlgren, Sweden (new entry) Source: S.

What&apos;s so bad about that? Well, the Irish government now predicts that this year GDP will fall more than 10% from its peak, crossing the line that is sometimes used to distinguish between a recession and a depression. But there&apos;s more to it: to satisfy nervous lenders, Ireland is being forced to raise taxes and slash government spending in the face of an economic slump, policies that will further deepen the slump. And it&apos;s that closing off of policy options that I&apos;m afraid might happen to the rest of us. The slogan Erin go bragh, usually translated as &quot;Ireland forever&quot;, is traditionally used as a declaration of Irish identity. But it could also, I fear, be read as a prediction for the world economy. How did Ireland get into its current bind? By being just like the US, only more so. Like Iceland, Ireland jumped with both feet into the brave new world of unsupervised global markets. Last year the Heritage Foundation declared Ireland the world&apos;s third-freest economy, behind only Hong Kong and Singapore. One part of the Irish economy that became especially free was the banking sector, which used its freedom to finance a monstrous housing bubble. Ireland became in effect a cool, snake-free version of coastal Florida. Then the bubble burst. The collapse of construction sent the economy into a tailspin, while plunging home prices left many owing more than their houses were worth. The result has been a rising tide of defaults and heavy losses for the banks. And the troubles of the banks are largely responsible for putting the Irish government in a policy straitjacket. On the eve of the crisis Ireland seemed to be in good shape, fiscally speaking, with a balanced budget and a low level of public debt. But the government&apos;s revenue which had become strongly dependent on the housing boom collapsed along with the bubble. Even more important, the Irish government found itself having to take responsibility for the mistakes of private bankers. Last September Ireland moved to shore up confidence in its banks by offering a government guarantee on their liabilities thereby putting taxpayers on the hook for potential losses of more than twice the country&apos;s GDP. The combination of deficits and exposure to bank losses raised doubts about Ireland&apos;s long-run solvency, reflected in a rising risk premium on Irish debt and warnings about possible downgrades from ratings agencies. Hence the harsh new policies. Earlier this month the Irish government simultaneously announced a plan to purchase many of the banks&apos; bad assets putting taxpayers even further on the hook while raising taxes and cutting spending, to reassure lenders. As I read the debate among Irish experts, there&apos;s widespread criticism of the bank plan, with many leading economists calling for temporary nationalisation instead. (Ireland has already nationalised one major bank.) The arguments of these Irish economists are very similar to those of a number of American economists, myself included, about how to deal with our own banking mess. But there isn&apos;t much disagreement about the need for fiscal austerity. As far as responding to the recession goes, Ireland appears to be really, truly without options, other than to hope for an export-led recovery if and when the rest of the world bounces back. So what does all this say about those of us who aren&apos;t Irish? For now, the US isn&apos;t confined by an Irish-type fiscal straitjacket: The financial markets still consider government debt safer than anything else. But we can&apos;t assume that this will always be true. Unfortunately, we didn&apos;t save for a rainy day: thanks to tax cuts and the war in Iraq, America came out of the &quot;Bush boom&quot; with a higher ratio of government debt to GDP than it had going in. And if we push that ratio another 30 or 40 points higher - not out of the question if economic policy is mishandled over the next few years - we might start facing our own problems with the bond market. That&apos;s one reason I&apos;m so concerned about the Obama administration&apos;s bank plan. If, as some of us fear, taxpayer funds end up providing windfalls to financial operators instead of fixing what needs to be fixed, we might not have the money to go back and do it right. And the lesson of Ireland is that you really, really don&apos;t want to put yourself in a position where you have to punish your economy in order to save your banks. \u2022 Paul Krugman, winner of the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, is a columnist for the New York Times, where this article first appeared"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/21/sebastian-coe-world-cup-2018-olympics", "sentences": ["But Dave Richards has joined the board so there is \u00adPremier League input, and we&apos;ve got a well- structured team that includes Keith Mills, my mentor and the chief executive of the 2012 bid.&quot; In his evocative closing speech in Singapore, which clinched the 2012 vote, Coe placed the concept of legacy at the core of his pitch.", "&quot;We&apos;re pursuing the same vision we set out in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-20T23:05:21Z", "title": "Sebastian Coe tells Donald McRae how winning the 2012 Games bid will help England host the 2018 World Cup", "tags": ["World Cup 2018", "Football", "Sport", "Olympic Games 2012", "UK news", "Lord Coe", "World Cup", "Olympic Games"], "article": "&quot;It&apos;s absolutely winnable,&quot; Sebastian Coe says intently as he leans forward and considers his latest sporting dream, of bringing the 2018 football World Cup to England. &quot;There are some very good reasons why England can win the bid but I also know from hard experience this is a long and lonely road. That&apos;s why I tend not to sit here and picture someone opening an envelope and saying: &apos;The 2018 World Cup goes to \u2026 England&apos;.&quot; As the man who galvanised London&apos;s once moribund 2012 Olympic bid into a triumphant campaign, Coe has a strong sense of the requirements needed to stage a World Cup. As one of Britain&apos;s greatest middle-distance runners, he also tasted victory, and defeat, in various Olympic finals. His memories of the narrow margin between those outcomes still mark him \u2013 especially as he shared both elation and despair with his father and former coach, Peter, who died on the eve of the Beijing Olympics last August. Coe might have been a member of the 2018 team for only a couple of months, but does he really believe England will win the bid? &quot;My gut says yes,&quot; Coe murmurs, &quot;but it&apos;s going to be a long slog. If we get the messaging and narrative right, and we work so hard that there is nowhere else to go, then, yes, of course England can win the World Cup bid. But bids deserve nothing. You have to make a compelling case, which resonates in international terms.&quot; Near the end of another draining day, it&apos;s possible to hear a grain of weariness in Coe&apos;s voice. As chairman of Locog, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, his remit is vast and exhausting. He is bound up so personally in delivering a successful Olympics that failure in 2012 would scar him, and undermine his chances of eventually slipping into the role of IOC president that has apparently been earmarked for him. But he has decided to stretch himself still further. &quot;I don&apos;t bid for a hobby,&quot; he says wryly, &quot;and normally I wouldn&apos;t have done another. But I feel strongly about it and I&apos;ve always believed that bringing a World Cup to this country would complete the most extraordinary decade of sport we might ever have. We could go from 2012 to 2014 and the Commonwealth Games in Scotland to 2018. On the back of that, if we can&apos;t do things for the long-term benefit of British sport and society, we should be shot. &quot;Football is also one of my passions, and my weekends feel empty if I don&apos;t go to a game [to watch Chelsea]. So I always knew, if I was asked to make a sensible contribution, it would be hard for me to say no. As long as people understood I couldn&apos;t do this in the way I&apos;ve immersed myself in 2012, then I would be comfortable making targeted contributions to a very smart team. And from my first couple of meetings I can say we&apos;re pretty much where we should be at this point of the campaign.&quot; Coe acknowledges some of the public relations disasters that scuppered England&apos;s 2006 World Cup bid. &quot;I wasn&apos;t close to the process but I can see how the &apos;Football&apos;s coming home&apos; theme alienated some countries. You need to make delegates feel comfortable with what you stand for through your consistency of message and ability to deliver. Eventually people cease looking at you as a bidding country \u2013 they focus on you purely as an organising committee. They think: &apos;Can we rely on them for six years?&apos; It&apos;s vital people feel confident and comfortable when they consider your campaign.&quot; He pauses when asked to identify England&apos;s most formidable rivals in the bidding race. &quot;Spain clearly has a good track record. The game is also growing dramatically in Australia. But at this level there are few bad bids. As I learnt from the Olympic process, it can come down to the \u00addelegates&apos; gut reaction at the very end.&quot; Another gut reaction is that the English game is divided by a chasm between the Football Association and the Premier League. Coe might be seen as a consensus figure but how can he help unite such conflicting camps? &quot;Give me a chance,&quot; he jokes. &quot;I&apos;ve only been doing this a few weeks. But Dave Richards has joined the board so there is \u00adPremier League input, and we&apos;ve got a well- structured team that includes Keith Mills, my mentor and the chief executive of the 2012 bid.&quot; In his evocative closing speech in Singapore, which clinched the 2012 vote, Coe placed the concept of legacy at the core of his pitch. Does he now share concerns that London&apos;s planned Olympic legacy is slipping away? &quot;No,&quot; he insists. &quot;This is not an easy process, and we&apos;ve set legacy targets that have never been set before. No other city came to the table with the concept of building an 80,000-seat stadium which could be demounted to a manageable legacy of 25,000 in the inner city. We&apos;re far further down the path than anything achieved by other cities.&quot; He is vague when asked whether that down-scaled Olympic stadium might be used by a football or rugby club on a regular basis after 2012. &quot;I&apos;m not quite sure where the legacy discussions have got to with the LDA [London Development Agency] on that issue. The stadium&apos;s primary purpose is track and field, and we shouldn&apos;t be ashamed of that. Sporting aspirations have always been massive in east London, without matching facilities, and we&apos;re doing that community a great service. Don&apos;t forget it&apos;s also taken an Olympic Games to bring a 50m swimming pool to London. With three-and-a-half years left, progress is being made and we certainly don&apos;t want a two-week Wimbledon effect. We&apos;re looking to create something lasting.&quot; The semantics surrounding 2012 have shifted since last August. Coe might have hailed Beijing as &quot;a spectacular Games&quot; that London would equal, but ambition has since been downgraded from an &quot;intimate&quot; to a &quot;functional&quot; Olympics. &quot;I don&apos;t use any of those words,&quot; Coe retorts. &quot;We&apos;re pursuing the same vision we set out in Singapore. We brought our business partners to the table very early and that&apos;s given us the clarity and certainty to move from planning to the operational phase \u2013 despite the economic downturn. It has also given us a financial cushion.&quot; Coe&apos;s passion, by now, is plain. &quot;It really matters to me that we do it well,&quot; he says. &quot;This has got to be so good and so meaningful and so relevant to people. It has to offer a great celebration and an enduring legacy \u2013 and I believe it will.&quot; In his new book, the 52-year-old Coe lays out the principles shaping his success on and off the track. At the heart of his narrative, an intriguing story unfolds in the relationship between Coe and his father. Coe has often been dismissed as a moneyed toff, yet his family life was more layered. His mother was an actress of Indian descent and his father was a working-class Londoner. &quot;I&apos;m not sure what my dad made of me ending up a Conservative,&quot; Coe says. &quot;He was a great trade unionist in his formative years and very involved in worker education in east London. He never lost that \u2013 even if he had a low opinion of politicians and party politics. In his last years, when he&apos;d virtually lost his sight, I would spend most Sunday afternoons reading great chunks of the newspaper to him because he was still so engaged in the world.&quot; The intimacy of that scene, with a middle-aged man reading the Sunday papers to his nearly blind father, makes a poignant contrast with the searing image of Peter Coe driving his young son relentlessly on the track. It perhaps explains why, in his book, Coe refers more to &quot;my coach&quot; than &quot;my father&quot;. He nods thoughtfully. &quot;It&apos;s a really good observation because we did try to compartmentalise our relationship. There were times when it was uncomfortable \u2013 especially when you&apos;re 14 and a man grabs your father at a cross-country course and starts yelling. He was pointing at me and saying: &apos;You&apos;re killing him.&apos; My dad said: &apos;Yes, I&apos;m killing him right the way to the top&apos;.&quot; They did reach &quot;the top&quot;, as Peter Coe always planned, but even at the pinnacle there were some desolate defeats. The most painful occurred in 1980, when Coe crumbled mentally in his supreme discipline, the 800m, and was defeated by his arch-rival, Steve Ovett, in the Moscow Olympics. His father berated him in public and told the press he was &quot;ashamed&quot;. Coe shakes his head. &quot;It was too subtle for journalistic currency,&quot; he says. &quot;He didn&apos;t mean he was ashamed of me. He was saying: &apos;I don&apos;t absolve myself. I am also accountable for this failure.&apos; And to the day he died he blamed himself for not taking a grip of the situation 12 hours before. He could&apos;ve said: &apos;Look, you are the fastest man on the planet at this distance. There is nothing you can&apos;t handle&apos;.&quot; A few days later Coe won gold in his less-favoured 1500m. He successfully defended that Olympic title in 1984 but his Moscow defeat remains the burning memory because Seb and Peter Coe were both bent on winning. Last August, with death closing in, Coe was at his father&apos;s bedside. &quot;Dad timed it perfectly because, as I stood there with my brother and sister, the Beijing Olympics were about to start.

This does not require an unusually talented newsagent. The Newseum website publishes getting on for 700 front page images, though about 400 of them are from North America. Visit the site and you can either scroll through galleries, or pick the ones you want from a list.  This isn&apos;t a practical way to read the news, of course, but it does get particularly interesting whenever there&apos;s a story that makes a wide impact. Examples in the Newseum&apos;s Archive List include the Columbia Shuttle Explosion in 2003, the Tsunami in 2004, the London bombings in 2005, and the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. However, the bulk of the website is concerned with the Newseum, which is a real museum in Washington, DC, not far from the Capitol. This month, the Newseum celebrated its first birthday on Pennsylvania Avenue, though it was actually founded in 1997, in Rosslyn, Virginia. It closed for six years before reopening in a striking $450m building in the centre of Washington last year. The building&apos;s exterior is dominated by a marble tablet 74ft high carrying the text of the First Amendment, which commands Congress not to abridge &quot;the freedom of speech, or of the press,&quot; among other things.  The Newseum&apos;s exhibits range from a 3,000-year-old cuneiform brick from Sumeria to a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter. It also has newspaper front pages going back almost 500 years, more than a thousand press passes, and sections of the Berlin Wall. Comics and prize-winning photographs are included, too. The Newseum claims to be the world&apos;s most interactive museum, and visitors can play at being a TV news anchor. One of the main functions of the website is to provide guides that visitors can download and print out (PDF), so they can plan ahead. Even if you&apos;ll never make it to the Newseum in person, the guides and a video tour provide some sense of what it&apos;s like. There&apos;s even a small online shop, which ships things like posters and T-shirts internationally, if you want to pick up a souvenir. The site&apos;s Fun and Games section includes quite a good trivia quiz that lets you print out a press pass to document your level of success. However, too many of the questions are US-oriented for an international audience. The Newseum, supported by the Freedom Forum, has a noble aim: to &quot;raise public awareness of the important role of a free press in a democratic society.&quot; It incorporates a memorial to 1,913 reporters, photographers and broadcasters who have died reporting the news. And given the rapid decline of the US newspaper industry at the moment, the Newseum could soon become the main memorial to a large number of newspapers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/apr/22/press-freedom-iran", "sentences": ["Afghanistan (1); Armenia (1); Azerbaijan (5); Bangladesh (1); Burma (14); Burundi (1); Cameroon (2); China (28); Cuba (21); Democratic Republic of the Congo (2); Ecuador (1); Egypt (1); Eritrea (13); Ethiopia (2); Gambia (1); Iran (5); Iraq in US custody (1); Iraq in Iraqi Kurdistan custody (1); Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (4); Ivory Coast (1); Maldives (1); Peru (2); Philippines (1); Russia (2); Senegal (1); Singapore (1); Sri Lanka (3); Uzbekistan (6); Vietnam (2)."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-22T09:15:20Z", "title": "Roy Greenslade: Roll call of shame - 125 journalists in jail", "tags": ["Press freedom", "Iran", "North Korea", "Media"], "article": "It is estimated that there are 125 journalists serving jail sentences across the globe, according to an audit by the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Benayoun, who snatched the equaliser in the second minute of stoppage time on a dramatic night at Anfield, said the resilience of the players meant United could not afford to be complacent. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult. United are a strong side but we won&apos;t give up and we will continue to try and do our best,&quot; said the Israel international. &quot;We will keep trying, look to win our remaining matches, and hopefully we can still do it.

There is no mystery in this, nor indeed very much to get worked up about. No one likes a playground bully and in the eyes of many the Old Firm have been the Flashman of Scottish football for decades now, flaunting their wealth and throwing their weight around with little regard for the feelings or wellbeing of others. &quot;They are like two old ladies on Sauchiehall Street lifting their skirts for every league that walks by,&quot; Keith Wyness, the former chief executive of Aberdeen and later of Everton, famously said when the two Glasgow clubs sought to &quot;escape&quot; Scottish football back in the mid-1990s into something called the Atlantic League. Wyness&apos; bawdy insult is worth recalling in the light of the news that once again the Old Firm stand accused of scheming to escape Scottish football \u2014 an odd accusation given the scheme has little to do with them. In fact, it is the idea of Bolton&apos;s chairman, Phil Gartside, who envisages a revamped English set-up which would mean the Premier League be reduced to 18 clubs and the introduction of a second league of 18 clubs, including the two Glasgow sides. Apparently, Gartside had hoped to place his proposals before the Premier League this week, although he may not get an opportunity to do so until the summer. Regardless of when he does make his pitch, it is safe to assume it will ultimately fail. Such certainty comes easily to anyone who has a cursory knowledge of football&apos;s labyrinthine politics. In the depressing clich\u00e9, turkeys do not vote for Christmas. In other words, middle-level English teams would not support the arrival of Celtic and Rangers into the Premier League lest it threaten their own place. If the intellectual laziness of this argument (what is Bolton if not a middle-level English club?) doesn&apos;t rouse neutrals, then what about this contribution from Wyness who re-emerged from his obscurity this week to make clear his antipathy towards Celtic and Rangers had not diminished with the passing of the years. &quot;What would the Old Firm bring to the Premier League?&quot; he asked, before answering his own question. &quot;Nothing.&quot; Credit where it is due. At least Wyness&apos; contribution was mercifully free of Christmas-fearing turkeys, although what points he gained for originality were sadly lost when it came to accuracy. The truth is the Old Firm would bring a great deal to English football, the most significant aspect of which would be a following \u2014 or, as the accountants would have it, &quot;a marketing base&quot; \u2014 that exceeds all but one or two of the current Premier League teams. Currently, Celtic and Rangers place third and fourth in average home attendance, behind Manchester United and Arsenal. They also have a travelling support the equal of any in English football. No doubt they have a fair share of hooligans, too, but it hardly requires a sociology doctorate to know that Glasgow does not have the monopoly on pissed-up reprobates. And although it is hard to believe overseas interest in the Premier League could grow, it undoubtedly would if Celtic and Rangers were involved, especially in North America and Australia, with their large Scottish diaspora. &quot;You can&apos;t afford to stand still,&quot; said the Premier League&apos;s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, last year. How true, although it always helps if you move in the right direction. The so-called 39th game, to which Scudamore was referring, was the wrong idea at the wrong time; half-baked and badly handled. Innovative, yes; workable, no. At the very least the idea of the Old Firm joining the Premier League qualifies as innovative. It is workable, too, both in a geographical and logistical sense \u2013 no trips to Singapore, no &quot;asymmetrical&quot; fixture list \u2013 and the folks in the marketing department would be licking their chops. Scudamore was right. You can&apos;t afford to stand still, which in this case means the Premier League shouldn&apos;t mindlessly add its own contribution to the bottomless pit of contempt felt for the Old Firm but should instead give Phil Gartside a fair hearing. --- There are only 10 days left before Ricky Hatton steps into the ring with Manny Pacquiao, and trepidation over the Englishman&apos;s chances mounts with every passing hour. Hatton may have replaced a limited trainer \u2014 Billy Graham \u2014 with an excellent one \u2014 Floyd Mayweather Sr \u2014 but he hasn&apos;t altered his lifestyle between bouts and nor, more worryingly, does he appear to have learned to keep his trap shut lest he provide his opponent with the extra motivation that comes with prospect of making a braggart dine out on his own hubris. &quot;Manny fights the same way all the time,&quot; Hatton said about his Filipino opponent this week. &quot;He&apos;s effective at what he does but he&apos;s not a versatile fighter. He&apos;s never met a man as fiery, ferocious or rough as me, and certainly not as big and strong. I don&apos;t think Manny is the most elusive. He&apos;s there to be hit. And if he gets hit he&apos;s going to get hit by the biggest man he&apos;s ever faced.&quot; No doubt there was an element of the circus barker in this stream of consciousness but nevertheless Hatton surely overstepped marketing responsibilities and to potentially damaging effect. Pacquiao, as he implies, is one-dimensional all right; he&apos;s brilliant, and he is brilliant all the time. -- Those of us who long ago dismissed &quot;Sir&quot; Allen Stanford as a used car salesman with delusions of grandeur will not be rushing to reconsider our opinion following an interview with the financier that appeared in the New York Times this week. It was, needless to say, a collector&apos;s item for those with an interest in the art of self-delusion. &quot;I don&apos;t think there is any money missing,&quot; insisted an apparently confused Stanford, who then went on to say that if there was money missing then it was only because of &quot;Gestapo tactics&quot; by the US government. There was more where that came from as Stanford, according to the Times, veered between defiance and self-pity. Reading through it all one could only gasp at the naivety of those who staked the credibility of English cricket on such a man. -- God forbid that anyone deny that Tiger Woods is the greatest thing that has ever happened to professional golf, but there is a scent of change, or at least scepticism, in the air after the world no1&apos;s recent performance at Augusta National, on and off the course. &quot;I was just a fraction off,&quot; Woods said of his play at the Masters, which came as news to those who watched him hit one shot 100 yards off, which is a hell of a fraction by anyone&apos;s standards.

Small, neat, handsome, witty, charming and seemingly at home anywhere, he had the rare knack of engaging and involving friends and acquaintances throughout his long life.  A perfectionist without obvious ambition, he left his own very specific mark. Mickey was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, the son of a shipwright and first world war veteran. He played football at inside-half for Scotland juniors at Hampden Park. As the second world war approached, he joined the Territorial Army, enlisting with the Royal Artillery.  Luck was already on his side. Of two troop carriers that sailed simultaneously from the Clyde in 1940, one stopped at Cape Town before proceeding to Singapore and was lost at sea. The other, Mickey&apos;s boat, berthed at Durban before sailing to Bombay.  Mickey&apos;s Burma campaign was long, dangerous and eventful. His roles included positioning artillery guns with pinpoint precision to bombard enemy lines. The training gave him the surveying skills he used, along with his innate charm, to survive for the rest of his life. Back home and delivering letters, he soon joined Ordnance Survey, spending the next decade tramping around Scotland, the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales as part of the metric resurvey of Britain.  It was a wonderfully carefree existence. At Thurso, the dead-flat bog country in the far north of Scotland, a key preliminary to the resurvey was to plot 1,000 metres to within one millimetre. As Mickey put it to Lois Sutcliffe, whom he met when working in Wharfedale in 1952: &quot;There&apos;s more landladies&apos; sandwiches in the Thurso bog than anywhere else in the country.&quot;  Lois and Mickey married in 1956 and moved to north London, where Mickey took a surveyor&apos;s job at Wood Green town hall. Work then led them to Essex, to Cornwall and finally back to Yorkshire.  Struggles with alcohol, which he eventually conquered, never impaired Mickey&apos;s abilities or his quirky humour. He once told me that &quot;a rolling sausage gathers no gravy&quot;. He was a rolling soul, but his memory lives on, not least with his former wife Lois, his son Stephen and his grandson Oliver. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 1 May.

Although Tom Hicks said the overall budget will be dictated to Ben\u00edtez by the owners, insiders say transfer talks will be entirely the manager&apos;s preserve. It is a big win for Ben\u00edtez, who has in the past been frustrated at the pace of negotiations. But while he has the blessing of Hicks and his co-owner, George Gillett, there are concerns within Anfield that his freedom goes too far. With a pre-season tour to Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand in July, Ben\u00edtez will have little time in which to haggle fees with other clubs and thrash out terms with the players, and it is likely to lead to more expensive transactions. After Rick Parry, who has previously conducted transfer business for Liverpool, leaves the club in May, there will be no one at Anfield with the experience to act as Ben\u00edtez&apos;s proxy once he departs on the pre-season tour. And there is a suspicion that this could lead to one of Ben\u00edtez&apos;s entourage, rather than any club official, talking the transfer turkey. Keane eye for cashpoint As a secretive recluse it is lucky that Ipswich Town&apos;s owner, Marcus Evans, can keep his head down. The club&apos;s new manager, Roy Keane, was delighted with the Drumaville group at Sunderland because &quot;they&apos;d watch the games and get a flight back home to Ireland&quot;. Of course it won&apos;t hurt that Evans is the UK&apos;s 30th-richest football club shareholder. Coincidentally, Keane fled Wearside soon after it became apparent that Paddy Kenny, Drumaville&apos;s largest shareholder, had run out of cash. Cup bid runneth empty Alistair Darling&apos;s increasing autonomy from No10 does not bode well for the England 2018 bid. The chancellor&apos;s budget ordered \u00a320m of savings from the department of culture, media and sport, with only \u00a37m already accounted for from the arts. It will be a battle royal between Gordon Brown, who was an even greater supporter of England&apos;s bid early on than the Football Association, and No11 as to whether the \u00a35m to stump up the bid can be found. Few in Whitehall expect it to come from the DCMS&apos;s shrinking pot. Athletes face final hurdle The agents of Britain&apos;s leading Olympians will head to UK Sport&apos;s London headquarters today to hear the funding body&apos;s final proposals on the athletes&apos; deed that will underpin the \u00a350m Team 2012 sponsorship programme. Both sides hope the meeting will produce an agreed document for the athletes to sign before next Thursday&apos;s deadline despite the Olympians&apos; enduring concerns over image-rights issues. But so rocky has the road previously been \u2014 some governing bodies were threatening to withdraw their athletes&apos; lottery funding unless they sign up \u2013 there will have to be conciliatory noises from UK Sport and its partner in the process, the British Olympic Association.

Mixed signals abound for Rafael Ben\u00edtez, and he has not lost faith in a Liverpool team that has suddenly lost the art of defending. No more lapses, he insists, and Manchester United could still be caught. Ben\u00edtez has an explanation for all 11 goals that Liverpool have conceded in their past four matches, although it is remiss to include Blackburn Rovers alongside Chelsea and Arsenal in that sequence when they rarely crossed the halfway line in their 4-0 defeat at Anfield. He is at a loss, however, to understand why his instructions should be forgotten and human error multiply at a critical juncture in Liverpool&apos;s pursuit of Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s team. Ben\u00edtez and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had cause to admonish their defences following their enthralling 4-4 draw on Tuesday night; their players, too. Daniel Agger, one of several off-colour Liverpool defenders that night, said: &quot;I don&apos;t even know how to explain what happened against Arsenal. To score four goals at Anfield and only get one point is just not good enough and we must improve on that.&quot; Liverpool had conceded just 10 goals all year until their defence began to show uncharacteristic weakness in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea. It had taken 17 games, a sequence stretching back to the 5-1 demolition of Newcastle on 28 December, for opponents to score the 11 goals that Liverpool have now conceded in a fortnight. &quot;It wasn&apos;t tiredness against Arsenal, it was simply bad decisions,&quot; the Liverpool manager said yesterday, as he \u00addiscussed tactics rather than Ferguson and Sam Allardyce&apos;s seemingly contrived complaints about the Spaniard&apos;s hand \u00adgesture to Xabi Alonso against Blackburn. &quot;Every player can make a mistake, but it is \u00adunusual to see three individual mistakes like that in the same game. &quot;We have to trust the players as normally they don&apos;t make these kind of mistakes. The fourth goal was our corner, a set-piece when we had time and control. We know how to defend from those positions, but because the players were trying so hard to score we got caught out. It&apos;s a positive that all the players were trying to help out and score, but the negative is that each one has a role they should do. The goalkeeper is a goalkeeper, and the striker is a striker. The people who were supposed to be defending should have been defending. The players were all trying to help, but many were in the wrong place.&quot; Ben\u00edtez cited the calibre of Arsenal and Chelsea as a contributory factor but he also admits that Liverpool were psychologically suspect during the Champions League quarter-final at Anfield. &quot;In the first leg against Chelsea [their] first goal made a massive difference in the head of our players because it was an away goal. For some of the players, it was too much. We then kept attacking and left them too many spaces. That first goal was very important.&quot; The Liverpool manager remains adamant, however, that Yossi Benayoun&apos;s stoppage-time equaliser against Arsenal could prove vital in the final reckoning. Experience tells the Spaniard that this title race is not over. Ben\u00edtez said: &quot;The message is clear: keep going. We cannot give up. To concede the fourth goal to Arsenal was a massive shock to us but we came back again and the point could still be crucial.&quot; Steven Gerrard will be absent for the fourth successive game today with an adductor strain, although Ben\u00edtez is \u00adcertain his captain will return for next weekend&apos;s visit of Newcastle. The \u00adLiverpool manager also admitted he is powerless to prevent Fernando Torres and his Spanish contingent taking part in the Confederations Cup in South Africa in June, with all those involved also obliged to play in the club&apos;s pre-season tour of Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore in July. &quot;The Spanish players have to go,&quot; Ben\u00edtez said. &quot;We can&apos;t change the \u00adsituation. We have to accept it. We have to \u00admanage the pre-season as well.

With its four soaring buttresses topped by statues, the Palais forms the centrepiece of the Parc des Expositions in Brussels - a trade-fair complex built in the 1930s to commemorate a century of independence from the Netherlands. This is the temporary home of thousands of fish products from around the world as 23,000 delegates descend from 80 countries for the annual European Seafood Exposition - the world&apos;s largest seafood trade show and a grim reminder of man&apos;s dominion over the oceans. &quot;If I wanted people to understand the global fishing crisis, I would bring them here,&quot; says Sally Bailey, a marine programme officer with the World Wide Fund for Nature, one of the more moderate NGOs combating the exploitation of the seas. Last year, one of the more militant groups - Greenpeace - managed to &quot;close down&quot; five exhibitors trading in critically endangered bluefin tuna, by deploying 80 activists to drape their stands in fishing nets, chain themselves to fixtures and put up banners that read: &quot;Time and tuna are running out&quot;.  Their main target was the Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese car manufacturer that is also the world&apos;s largest tuna trader, controlling 60% of the market and accounting for 40% of all bluefin tuna imported into Japan from the Mediterranean. The other companies were Dongwon Industries (Korea), Moon Marine (Taiwan/ Singapore), Azzopardi Fisheries (Malta) and Ricardo Fuentes &amp; Sons (Spain). The day I am there, Greenpeace activists are stalking EU fisheries ministers and waiting for a chance to unfurl their banners - but the security guards thwart them. However, the gargantuan catch on display speaks for itself. At the stand run by the Sea Wealth Frozen Food Company of Thailand, the shelves are groaning with jauntily designed packets of frozen squid, surimi (minced fish) dumplings, spring rolls, samosas and deep-fried cones with shrimp tails poking out of them. In the next aisle, a frenetic chef is wok-frying prawns from Madagascar, dipping them in little square dishes of cumin, coriander, chilli powder, salt, cinnamon and garlic. At the Taiwan Pavilion, the cabinets are full of chilled and frozen tilapia, barramundi, sushi, eel and vacuum packs of tobiko - orange flying-fish roe, salty, crunchy as granola and served by a young woman in national dress who literally has not heard of sustainability. &quot;All the boats are out there catching fish with roe,&quot; she tells me. &quot;With so many after the same species, this is a very difficult business for us.&quot;  These halls take several hours to negotiate, and the stands seemingly go on forever - 1,650 businesses in all, together peddling most of the 147m tonnes of seafood produced globally every year. Of this, 100m tonnes is caught in the wild while the rest is farmed to satisfy an insatiable demand. Already, 1.2bn people depend on fish in their diet - and in Europe we each consume 20kg per year on average, compared to 5kg per person in India. However, as the emergent middle classes in Asia develop a taste, and a budget, for seafood - considered a luxury item until now - demand will rocket further. What the organisers must know, but are keeping mum about, is that the oceans are in a parlous state. The UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 70% of the world&apos;s fisheries are now fully exploited (ie, fished to the point where they can only just replenish themselves), overexploited or depleted. The majority of fish populations have been reduced by 70-95%, depending on the species, compared to the level they would be at if there were no fishing at all. In other words, only five per cent of fish are left in some cases. In more practical terms, fishermen are catching one or two fish per 100 hooks, compared to 10 fish per 100 hooks where a stock is healthy and unexploited - a measure of sustainability once used by the Japanese fleet. In England and Wales, we are landing one fish for every 20 that we landed in 1889, when government records began, despite having larger vessels, more sophisticated technology and trawl nets so vast and all-consuming that they are capable of containing 12 Boeing 747 aircraft.  Where have all those other fish gone? In short, we have eaten them. &quot;Tens of thousands of bluefin tuna used to be caught in the North Sea every year,&quot; says Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York. &quot;Now, there are none. Once, there were millions of skate - huge common skate, white skate, long-nosed skate - being landed from seas around the UK. The common skate is virtually extinct, the angel shark has gone. We have lost our marine megafauna as a consequence of exploitation.&quot; Then there are the devastating effects of bottom trawling around our coasts, which began with the advent of the steam trawler 130 years ago. &quot;Sweeping backwards and forwards across the seabed, they removed a whole carpet of invertebrates,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;such as corals, sponges, sea fans and seaweeds. On one map, dating from 1883, there is a huge area of the North Sea roughly the size of Wales, marked &apos;Oyster beds&apos;. The last oysters were fished there commercially in the 1930s; the last live oyster was taken in the 1970s. We have altered the marine environment in a spectacular way.&quot;  Worse still, after stripping our own seas bare, we have &quot;exported fishing capacity to the waters of developing countries&quot;, Professor Roberts warns. Off Mauritania, Senegal and other West African countries, fleets from the rich industrial north are &quot;fishing in a totally unsustainable way with minimal oversight by European countries&quot;. In return for plundering the oceans, which deprives local people of food, and artisanal fishermen of their livelihood, these vessels pay minimal fees that impoverished countries are happy to accept. &quot;It is a mining operation,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;a rerun of the exploitation of terrestrial wealth that happened in colonial days. This is colonialism in a new guise, albeit with a respectable cloak in the form of access agreements.&quot;  Such is the human feeding frenzy, there may come a time when there are no fish left to catch. In 2006, a study in the US journal Science warned that every single species we exploit would have collapsed by 2048 if populations continued to decline as they had since the 1950s. By 2003, nearly a third of all species had collapsed, the study found - meaning their numbers were down 90% or more on historic maximum catch levels. Extrapolate that on a graph, and the downward curve reaches 100% just before 2050.  That prognosis - now disputed - was based on a four-year study of fish populations, catch records and ocean ecosystems. &quot;We really see the end of the line now,&quot; said the author Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the time. &quot;It will be in our lifetime. Our children will see a world without seafood, if we do not change things.&quot; Many imagined a world where there would be no fish protein left to eat apart from jellyfish and marine algae. What the study did not make sufficiently clear was that some fish populations had bounced back as a result of drastic measures by the authorities. In countries such as Iceland, Norway, the United States, New Zealand and Australia, fisheries management has been strengthened by controls that limit fishing effort (the number of boats out there, the time they spend at sea and the areas where they are allowed to fish). Another management approach, especially in Europe, is to control output (the amount of fish landed) using Total Allowable Catch quotas, or TACs. These are designed to maintain a stock&apos;s biomass - the estimated weight of fish left in the sea after fishing and natural deaths are taken into account. It should never be allowed to fall so low that a species is unable to spawn a healthy generation the following year. Drawn up by scientists and organisations such as Ices (the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), these quotas are discussed by fisheries ministers and fishermen at forums such as the EU. Both have vested interests, whether political or commercial. &quot;If you put the fox in charge of the henhouse,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;decisions will be based on short-term constraints, such as paying the mortgage on the boat. Politicians, too, make choices that are beneficial to them or their constituents in the short term.&quot;  In other words, such gatherings often ride roughshod over the scientists&apos; recommendations - as happened at a meeting of ICCAT (the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) in Luxembourg in 2007, where quotas were being thrashed out for bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean. Scientists recommended an annual catch of 15,000 tonnes a year, with a preference for 10,000 tonnes - but EU ministers agreed a quota of 29,000 tonnes, enough to guarantee the collapse of the species. (Last year, quotas for 2009 were again set far higher than scientists were advising.) In fact, the real amount of bluefin landed was 61,000 tonnes - four times what scientists had recommended - due to illegal and unreported fishing. Last month, the European Commission implemented a two-year control and inspection programme for bluefin tuna fisheries in seven Mediterranean countries, to clamp down on things such as illegal spotter planes used to track down tuna schools. Globally, black-market fishing is worth US$25bn (\u00a317bn) a year. In Europe, 50% of the cod we eat has been caught illegally. Those figures, and the Luxembourg debacle, are recorded in The End of the Line - the documentary, based on Charles Clover&apos;s book of that name, to be screened in UK cinemas from 8 June. However, the blatant disregard for science it portrays is not an isolated case. &quot;We have analysed the decision-making of European fisheries ministers over the past 20 years,&quot; says Professor Roberts, &quot;and systematically, year on year, they have set quotas that are 25 to 35% higher than the levels recommended by scientists.&quot;  How can our politicians get away with it? &quot;There is no obligation upon them to take scientific advice,&quot; Professor Roberts explains. &quot;What they will tell you is that it is only one of the things they have to consider. While they might be protecting a fisherman&apos;s livelihood in the term of one or two years, short-term decision-making like that guarantees stock collapse. It is not just a possibility, it is a certainty. The only uncertainty is how long it will take.&quot;  According to Professor Roberts: &quot;What politicians should be deciding is how the catch is allocated within different nations. That is politics. What they shouldn&apos;t be deciding is how big the catch should be in the first place. That is science.&quot;  In Norway and the US, &quot;they respect the advice of scientists&quot;, he adds - the best example being New England, where stocks of ground fish were in serious decline in the mid-1990s, but enlightened management brought them back. &quot;At Georges Bank, they created a closed area of 20,000 square kilometres that was off-limits to mobile fishing gear [such as trawl nets],&quot; Professor Roberts explains. They also cut fishing effort by a draconian 50% - putting many fishermen out of business. In the past 10 years, however, there has been &quot;a spectacular recovery&quot; of key economic species, Roberts says. &quot;The haddock has bounced back, the flounder has bounced back, the scallops have bounced back, so it has been a great success story.&quot;  What this demonstrates is that, where there is political will, the tide can be turned on overfishing. In the US, a piece of 1976 legislation called the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act has recently been reauthorised, requiring the industry to end overfishing in all federal waters by 2011. There is no such legislation in Europe. Under the existing Act, fisheries in Alaska and the North Pacific are already well managed - which is why wild Pacific salmon, Pacific cod and pollock from Alaska were prime candidates for certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the international NGO that created a standard for sustainable fisheries in the late 1990s and upholds it. Why do these US fisheries tick all the boxes?  &quot;They have very progressive management under the North Pacific Fishery Management Council,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;with precautionary targets - so they go for a relatively low fraction of the fish population each year. They have closures to protect habitats and valued species such as Steller sea lions and sea otters [which can get caught in fishing gear] plus extensive areas that are closed to protect deep-water corals from destruction by bottom trawling.&quot;The authorities also impose quotas for bycatch - other species caught by mistake - to protect them from exploitation.  These are the kinds of issues the MSC is looking at when certifying fisheries. So far, 43 have been certified, including 10 in Britain, while more than 100 are under assessment - but what exactly does that mean? &quot;Right from the start, the idea was that fisheries would be independently assessed by a third party,&quot; says James Simpson, communications officer at the MSC, &quot;so although we set the standard, we don&apos;t carry out the assessments. That is important, because it means we don&apos;t have any influence over the results.&quot; Instead, marine scientists from certifying bodies such as Food Certification International and Moody Marine do the work, delving into every aspect of sustainability and producing a report up to 900 pages long. &quot;They look at stock levels, based on historical records,&quot; says Simpson, &quot;at the impact fishing is having on the environment and at the management plan for the fishery.&quot;  A score of 80 or more must be achieved against each of these three criteria for a fishery to be certified.  The initial assessment is peer-reviewed by fellow scientists, stakeholders such as environmental groups have their say - and the fishery gets to carry the eco-label on its products. &quot;To do that, you have to be able to trace the fish all the way through the supply chain,&quot; says Simpson, &quot;because you don&apos;t want any non-certified species or illegally caught fish slipping into an MSC batch.&quot;  The science may be rigorous, but will the MSC label change the world?  With some species, the label is making a big difference: 42% of the world&apos;s wild salmon catch is MSC-certified, and 40% of its prime white fish catch. Altogether, five million tonnes of seafood are certified by the MSC every year.  However, that is just five per cent of the wild-caught seafood market, which is why Professor Roberts believes the label itself &quot;can only change a small number of well-informed people who actually care&quot;. The big effect, he says, is that supermarkets &quot;have taken on board what the MSC is saying and have developed better fish sourcing policies of their own. They are the ones who can buy or not buy from a particular supplier, so they have a lot of power.&quot;  Sainsbury&apos;s - the largest retailer of MSC-certified seafood in the UK - has pledged that, by the end of 2010, it will source 80% of its seafood from MSC-certified fisheries or from the &quot;green list&quot; of species approved by the Marine Conservation Society. Marks &amp; Spencer has promised that, by 2012, all its seafood will be either MSC-certified or from other independently certified fisheries. In May, it will launch a new range of prepared meals for outdoor eating and barbecues, based around gurnard, John Dory and black bream. Caught in season in British waters, these are a more sustainable choice than the &quot;Big Five&quot; overfished species - the cod, haddock, prawns, tuna and plaice that account for 80% of all seafood sold in Britain. If we take the pressure off these overexploited stocks, they will hopefully recover. However, the MSC programme is about far more than shopping. In Europe, the growing number of certified fisheries has transformed the mood of EU fishing negotiations. The Dutch based Pelagic Freezer-Trawler Association (PFA) was the first North Sea herring fishery to be MSC-certified in May 2006, and the Swedish, Danish and Scottish herring fleets followed. Their representatives meet regularly in Brussels to talk about fisheries management. &quot;All the major herring players in Europe are MSC-certified or under assessment,&quot; says Gerard van Balsfoort, president of the PFA, &quot;and this has led to a certain kind of behaviour in the advisory process. From the point of view of stocks, you can&apos;t just ask for a higher quota if it isn&apos;t scientifically based. You can&apos;t just shout for what you want. &quot; In the seas around South Georgia - a remote Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom 1,300km from the Falkland Islands - the Patagonian toothfish fishery was required by MSC certifiers to initiate research that would locate deep-coral areas vulnerable to damage by trawl gear. If such areas were found, efforts to protect them &quot;should be considered&quot;, the certifiers said. In fact, the fishery went further. It identified three deep-coral areas that needed protecting and closed them to fishing vessels entirely. That way, fish and fragile habitats would have a chance to recover.  In South Africa and New Zealand, too, MSC-certified fisheries (for hake and hoki respectively) have helped create Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) where trawling is banned, either by funding research or by lobbying the government. In New Zealand, 30% of the Exclusive Economic Zone - an area extending 220 miles out to sea over which it has rights - has been closed with fishing industry approval. Such closures could provide the answer to the fishing crisis, allowing our children and our grandchildren to eat fish with a clear conscience. In Iceland, Canada and the US, the creation of MPAs &quot;has brought real increases in fish populations and real recovery of seabed habitats&quot;, Professor Roberts reports. &quot;Populations of exploited species have increased five-, 10- or even 20-fold within five, 10 or 20 years,&quot; he says. &quot;What you see is the flourishing of life.&quot; Over time, this explosion of fecundity spreads to other parts of the ocean. &quot;The benefits of protection flow to the surrounding fishing grounds through the emigration of animals from protected areas, and the export of their offspring on ocean currents,&quot; Professor Roberts says. &quot;The eggs and larvae of these protected animals are transported to fishing grounds and can replenish them.&quot; In his view, 30% of the world&apos;s oceans should be protected &quot;to set the clock back 200 years&quot; and reverse the fishing crisis. After that, responsible fisheries management &quot;in the North Pacific mould&quot; could avert the 2048 scenario. The trouble is, only 0.8% of the oceans are currently closed to fishing - despite the efforts of former President George W Bush, who &quot;single-handedly created MPAs, dotted throughout the Pacific Ocean, which now constitute 31% of all MPAs worldwide&quot;, Professor Roberts says.  In Britain, too, MPAs are seen as part of the solution. The Marine Bill is grinding its way through Parliament, with a provision to create MPAs in territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles from our coast. Britain and Europe have pledged to create networks of MPAs by 2012. Far from campaigning for a total ban on fishing, Professor Roberts believes it should be allowed. If properly regulated, it will increase global fish production rather than decimate it. &quot;Fisheries science suggests that a species is healthiest when you reduce its population size by 50%,&quot; he says. &quot;That way, you remove the larger, older, slower-growing animals and the population becomes dominated by smaller, faster-growing fish. For them, the availability of food increases and they thrive. That gives you a boost in population growth rate, which gives you a higher rate of production to exploit.&quot; Perversely, fishing could swamp the world with fish protein rather than starve it - but it has to be done differently. &quot;We should abandon quotas,&quot; Professor Roberts believes, limiting fishing effort rather than output. &quot;If you&apos;re not out there catching fish, they&apos;re not going to die.&quot; At present, EU vessels that exceed their quota have to dump fish overboard dead, rather than land it illegally. &quot;You&apos;ve got one or two times as many fish being killed and discarded, sometimes, as are being landed,&quot; Professor Roberts says. &quot;That is no way to manage a fishery; that is not sensible at all. You have to land all your catch.&quot; Reforms such as this will require &quot;a major change of political direction on this side of the Atlantic&quot;, Professor Roberts warns - &quot;but if we have that, we can turn back the clock within 20 years, to the point where a lot of species are in a far more productive state. None of this is rocket science. Perhaps we need good old George W Bush back... the world&apos;s greatest marine conservationist!&quot;  \u2022 Read more from Andrew Purvis about fish on OFM&apos;s food blog, Word of Mouth.

Brighton, Ludlow and Wetherby are hardly a good advert for the &quot;Keep Sunday Special&quot; mantra which was trotted out when Sunday racing began here. One rule about having a bet at Brighton is look out for course winners, so step forward Bienheureux (3.50), who is going for his third consecutive victory in today&apos;s 12-furlongs handicap. With smart claimer David Probert booked, the eight-year-old looks to have been teed up for this and he is well enough weighted, off a mark 3lb lower than last yer when he cruised home by four and a half lengths. With Nina Carberry coming over to ride Heroes (3.25) in the ladies&apos; race at Wetherby, Tim Vaughan&apos;s gelding has been all the rage in betting this morning. He has only raced on soft ground over hurdles so far and could be thrown in at the weights here now that he encounters a fast surface. Yeats is 6-4 on to land the Vintaage Crop Stakes at Navan for the third year running. Obviously, he has a great record first time out and it will be a surprise if he is beaten. At Longchamp, Tajaaweed (2.50) should go close in the Ganay after showing up well in his recent work at Newmarket. Sir Michael Stoute took him out of yesterday&apos;s Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown, which he won with Tartan Bearer, to come here and clearly feels Tajaaweed is ready for a crack at Group One rivals. 3pm It&apos;s the Vision thing Tony Paley reports: Last year&apos;s French Derby victor Vision D&apos;Etat wins the first Group 1 race of 2009 when winning a shade comfortably in the Prix Ganay at Longchamp. Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s No 1 runner Thewayyouare weakened back into fourth having led for a long way while Tajaaweed was a disappointment, finishing last of the eight after never looking like landing a blow. Trainer Eric Libaud said: &quot;He seems a lot stronger than he was last year. I&apos;d like to keep him at the same trip, and the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot is a possibility - among other races.&quot; Elie Lellouche nominated the Prix d&apos;Ispahan as runner-up Loup Breton&apos;s next likely port of call, while O&apos;Brien was pleased with Thewayyouare. &quot;He seemed to enjoy the trip and this was a nice race to start him off in,&quot; he said. Jockey Johnny Murtagh added: &quot;The ground was maybe just a little quicker than he would have liked - I think he might like a bit more ease - but he ran very well. He is definitely a Group One horse.&quot; Jockey Richard Hills blamed the ground for the performance of Tajaaweed. &quot;He&apos;s a great big horse who needs to get his toe in, but the ground was a bit too quick out there,&quot; reported Hills. 5pm Yeats suffers shock defeat Tony Paley reports: It could have been the soft ground or the fact that it was his first runner of the season, but there will need to be some excuse for Yeats who was beaten out of sight after being sent off the 4-5 favourite in the Vintage Crop Stakes at Navan. Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s triple Ascot Gold Cup winner did not look happy from some way out and eventually finished tailed off as the John Oxx-trained Alandi battled home to stay unbeaten on the second race of his career. William Hill reacted by pushing out Yeats&apos;s price to 3-1 from 7-4 after the race, shortening Hindu Kush to 25-1 from 50-1 after he finished second in the Listed race. Coastal Path was trimmed to 8-1 from 10-1, along with Veracity (9-1 from 10-1), whilst Eastern Anthem and Geordieland were also cut to 10-1 from 12-1.  Kate Miller, spokeswoman for Hill&apos;s, said: &apos;&apos;Yeats defeat presents a conundrum for punters in the Gold Cup market. There may be excuses about the ground from connections, but he really seemed a shadow of his former self at Navan this afternoon. It is not a vintage era for Flat stayers at the moment, so the champion title could be there for the taking.&apos;&apos; 5.15pm Presvis name to remember Luca Cumani sent out Presvis to victory in the Audemars Piguet QEII Cup at a rain-soaked Sha Tin in Hong Kong earlier today and looks to have a high-class colt on his hands.  Only hours after stepping off a plane following three rides at Sandown yesterday, Ryan Moore executed a trademark plan to perfection after charging through the field to beat home favourite Viva Pataca by a length with Hong Kong Derby runner-up Thumbs Up third.  In Dubai at the end of March with Moore again in the saddle, the five-year-old finished second to Gladiatorus in the Dubai Duty Free to hand Cumani another Group One second place finish after just falling short in December&apos;s Hong Kong Vase and twice in the Melbourne Cup.  &quot;It&apos;s nice to get the monkey off our back and win this one, and we did it well too,&quot; said a beaming Cumani. &quot;He is now a legitimate Group One horse. We thought after the way he ran in Dubai that he belonged in Group One company and now we know he can win Group One races. He is a progressive horse and he has improved physically over the last six months and mentally he has got calmer and the two things have come together to make him a better horse.&quot;  Cumani will now look towards next month&apos;s Singapore International Airlines Cup before handing Presvis a well-earned break ahead of a return to Hong Kong in December for the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Cup.  Moore said: &quot;He is horse that ever since I have sat on him I knew he was a good horse and he showed that in Dubai and today he has taken his chance on the big stage. They went a good pace down for the first half-mile and then slackened off down the back. They were quickening into the turn but once he passed one has was going to pass them all.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/apr/27/obituary-bob-boucher", "sentences": ["He was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and continued his enthusiastic work on the international front in his role as a senior adviser on higher education in Singapore and Japan."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-26T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Bob Boucher", "tags": ["University of Sheffield", "University of Manchester", "Engineering general"], "article": "Bob Boucher, who has died of a heart attack at 68, served as vice-chancellor of two leading British universities, the University of Sheffield and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist). He was also a distinguished engineer, known for his research in fluid mechanics, particularly the specialist field of fluidics - an important technology in which the flow of a fluid, such as air or water, is manipulated to produce control effects without the use of moving parts. The technique was applied by Bob to a wide range of pumps, valves, flow meters and ventilation equipment, making these devices inherently reliable and finding applications in the safety-critical nuclear, oil and gas industries. Bob&apos;s research expertise extended beyond the field of fluid mechanics. He was, for example, one of the first engineers to employ a superconducting magnet as a research tool, using its intense magnetic field to separate out ash and pyrites from pulverised coal. These sulphur-containing contaminants are the source of acid rain pollution from coal-fired power stations and their removal is critical to the re-emergence of coal as a fuel for electricity generation. Throughout his career, Bob retained a keen personal interest in the development of his young researchers, both during and after their time at Sheffield. Many academic staff around the world also benefited from his guidance. One of his most fruitful international collaborations was with Professor Yasuki Nakayama, the Japanese doyen of fluid control and measurement, with whom he collaborated on the publication of a celebrated textbook, Introduction to Fluid Mechanics (1998), and in the organisation of a series of international conferences. Born in Wembley, north-west London, Bob spent the greater part of his working life at Sheffield University. After attending the Jesuit St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill, he went on to study mechanical engineering at Borough Polytechnic, where he was president of the students&apos; union in his final year. In 1962, he moved from London to the University of Nottingham, where he obtained a PhD and became a postdoctoral fellow, also meeting his wife Rosemary who was a fellow student at the university. He then spent four years at Queen&apos;s University, Belfast, first as university research fellow and subsequently as a lecturer in mechanical engineering. In 1970, he was appointed to a lectureship in mechanical engineering at Sheffield, beginning his long association with the university; he was promoted to a personal chair in 1985 and became head of department in 1987. In this role he raised the research profile of the department in the National Research Assessment Exercise to Grade 5A, the highest grade. Bob was supportive of international studies, developing a highly successful European programme and introducing the UK&apos;s first degree course combining engineering with Japanese studies. In 1992, he was appointed pro-vice-chancellor with responsibility for academic affairs and then research.  Within three years Bob had become principal and vice-chancellor of Umist. A keen strategist, he quickly introduced research and teaching in the life and environmental sciences to parallel Umist&apos;s traditional strengths in the physical sciences and engineering. He recognised the importance of continuously improving quality in higher education. He was a director of the Quality Assurance Agency and a member of the Higher Education Funding Council of England&apos;s Quality Assessment Committee, which has responsibility for overseeing teaching quality in the English university sector. Bob returned to Sheffield as vice-chancellor in 2001 and oversaw a capital works programme that witnessed the construction of landmark buildings and laboratories, and high-quality student accommodation. Added to this weredevelopments such as the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre with Boeing, and the Rolls-Royce Factory of the Future. Significant growth in student numbers accompanied these achievements and investment in alumni relations followed, creating a network of more than 120,000 alumni. In 2005 the university celebrated its centenary with a year-long programme of events. Bob worked tirelessly to promote his own speciality of engineering to as wide an audience as possible. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1994 and was appointed CBE in 2000 for his services to higher education and the engineering profession. He was also the recipient of the Felber Medal of the Czech Technical University and honorary doctorates from the State University of New York and the University of Sheffield. When Bob retired as vice-chancellor in 2007 he maintained his association with the local community by taking the role as deputy lieutenant for South Yorkshire and the chairmanship of the Sheffield Museums and Galleries Trust. He was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and continued his enthusiastic work on the international front in his role as a senior adviser on higher education in Singapore and Japan.  Bob was a visionary leader who took a personal interest in people, always willing to offer positive advice and at the same time to be a friend; his inherent charm and conviviality, no matter what the occasion, will be sadly missed. He is survived by Rosemary, two sons and a daughter. A third son died in infancy. \u2022 Robert Francis Boucher, engineer and university administrator, born 25 April 1940; died 25 March 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/27/horse-racing", "sentences": ["Presvis, who had run second to \u00adGladiatorus from a poor draw in the Dubai Duty Free, will now be aimed at next month&apos;s Singapore International Airlines Cup before being rested with a view to returning to Hong Kong in December for the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Cup."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-26T23:05:24Z", "title": "Heffernan blames soft going for Yeats' shock defeat", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Yeats, only the second horse in history to win the Ascot Gold Cup three times, gave no encouragement that a record fourth victory is within his grasp when he trailed in eighth of the 10 runners behind Alandi in yesterday&apos;s Vintage Crop Stakes at Navan.

The ground may have been softer than ideal for Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s horse and, as an eight-year-old entire, he may be harder to get fit at home these days. But Yeats was under pressure before the home turn and, after two cracks of the whip from jockey Seamus Heffernan, he found nothing for pressure in a race he had won first time out the previous two seasons. Heffernan, while admitting to being &quot;disappointed&quot; with Yeats, who blew very hard after the race, remained \u00adconfident that Yeats would be back in business for the Gold Cup. &quot;He just got tired in the ground,&quot; he said. &quot;Getting him right for the big day is what matters.&quot; Alandi was a notable winner of the \u00adVintage Crop on just his second start. &quot;We had plenty looking to buy him at the end of last season as a hurdler but he is very well bred and we decided to hold on to him,&quot; said his trainer, John Oxx. &quot;He should improve from the run and will go for the Saval Beg Stakes at Leopardstown next month.&quot; Kasbah Bliss, a possible rival for Yeats in the Gold Cup, did not cover himself in glory either in yesterday&apos;s Prix de \u00adBarbeville at Longchamp.

Vision d&apos;Etat, last year&apos;s French Derby winner, is trained by Eric Libaud, who could bring the colt to Royal Ascot in June. &quot;He seems a lot stronger than he was last year,&quot; said Libaud. &quot;I&apos;d like to keep him at 10 furlongs and the Prince Of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot is a possibility.&quot; Presvis, trained by Luca Cumani, is also entered for the Prince Of Wales&apos;s Stakes, but it appears the five-year-old will now steer clear of the top British races in \u00admidsummer to chase greater riches abroad. Presvis scooped a first prize of \u00a3700,000 when successful in the \u00adAudemars Piguet QEII Cup in Hong Kong yesterday morning. Ryan Moore, who arrived at Sha Tin with just a few hours to spare after \u00adscoring on Tartan Bearer at Sandown, brought Presvis with a well-timed run to collar the local favourite, Viva Pataca, and win by a length. Presvis, who had run second to \u00adGladiatorus from a poor draw in the Dubai Duty Free, will now be aimed at next month&apos;s Singapore International Airlines Cup before being rested with a view to returning to Hong Kong in December for the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Cup. &quot;He is now a legitimate Group One horse,&quot; said Cumani. &quot;He is progressive and has improved physically over the last six months. Mentally he has got calmer and the two things have come together to make him a better horse.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/28/budget-50p-tax-brain-drain", "sentences": ["Why not the 15% to 20% rate available in Hong Kong or Singapore, or the tax-free haven that is Dubai?"], "publicationDate": "2009-04-28T08:00:00Z", "title": "Tetsuya Ishikawa: The 50p tax brain drain will cost the Treasury", "tags": ["Budget", "Tax", "Tax and spending", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Financial crisis", "Global recession", "Business", "Budget 2009"], "article": "Richard Branson said the 50% top rate of income tax was a &quot;block to the next wave of entrepreneurs&quot;. Many other entrepreneurs have echoed this sentiment while consultancies, like the Centre for Economics and Business Research and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, have argued from another angle \u2013 that the tax hike will cost the government money. But the point is the same \u2013 that there will be a brain drain. In fact, it&apos;s not so much an argument as a fear that&apos;s being realised as we speak. A year ago, Hugh Osmond (who has already stated his intentions to leave the UK this time around) voiced concerns that there would be an exodus of entrepreneurs and businesses. WPP, Shire and United Business Media threatened to redomicile in their entirety. But this in itself wasn&apos;t news either. Hedge funds, led by the hugely profitable and highly regarded Brevan Howard, were already considering relocating away from the increasingly hostile tax environment. So this 50% tax rate is not just a very good reason to leave but a trigger for a movement that&apos;s been under way for some time. That would also explain why so many others have already announced their departures too or if they haven&apos;t, are already considering relocation. This reaction shouldn&apos;t be underestimated. Within three hours of the 50% tax rate being announced last Wednesday, I had spoken to one hedge fund trader, a stock analyst, a corporate financier and a financial markets sales person in the City, all of whom were already planning or had formally requested to management a relocation away from London to a tax-friendly jurisdiction. After all, most City roles are mobile and don&apos;t need to be in London \u2013 they are easily transferable thanks to modern software and communication technology. Moreover, given the tax hike smells of class war, there&apos;s no guarantee that 50% is the natural stopping point. As Stanley Fink, chairman of the FTSE 100-listed hedge fund MAN Group said, &quot;there&apos;s nothing to say for the richest, it won&apos;t go to 60%&quot;. Why not the 15% to 20% rate available in Hong Kong or Singapore, or the tax-free haven that is Dubai? Of course, Geneva is less lucrative but much closer to home. Either way, it just doesn&apos;t matter as long as it&apos;s not the UK. What makes this real is the fact that this 50% tax rate is affecting almost every key decision maker at mid and senior-level management in the City. This band of professionals have big ambitions, without which they would not have reached the positions they now occupy, and with that ambition comes mobility and flexibility. In any case, many would have already worked abroad so relocation is not really the deterrent or upheaval that it may have been, say, 30 years ago in the era of pre-globalisation and less mobility. But what&apos;s driving this is not just the financial self-interests of entrepreneurs and City workers. It&apos;s the commercial necessity to be where the action is. London became a financial hub because many of the world&apos;s corporate decision makers congregated here. That made London a significant focal point for revenue generation. But without that, London is just another city. In fact, it&apos;s worse now because the 50% tax rate hits not just City businesses but the ability of every business in this country to attract the best talents. And if that handicap is going to be felt which it will, those firms will have no choice but to relocate to a jurisdiction where the tax structure is not prohibitive, if they are to remain competitive. And it doesn&apos;t stop there. This has the potential to develop into a real herd movement, where others simply start following those who are leaving, in much the same way they followed them to London in the first place. So it&apos;s not hard to see why the main loser is going to be the Treasury. The public should be told what the \u00a37bn tax generation might actually be if all these trends take off in the next year because it&apos;s conceivable that number is negative. The public should also be told what the potential reduction in income and corporate tax receipts might be as a result of this. But that&apos;s highly unlikely to happen, given it would expose the ironic short-termism that politicians are more guilty of than bankers. However, the implications of that are going to be felt by the regular taxpayer, who will end up shouldering the national debt and budget deficits alone, without the help of those who helped create the mess because they would have escaped to another jurisdiction.

It&apos;s not so much London&apos;s overall ranking as the 38th best city in the world in which to live that I have difficulty comprehending (I&apos;d love to see it even higher); it is Mercer&apos;s conclusion that London is the eighth best city in the world for infrastructure (including public transport, traffic congestion and international flights from airports) that leaves me somewhat bemused. Eighth best city in the world? For infrastructure? Really? The report says: &quot;London&apos;s ranking in the infrastructure index reflects the high level of public services offered, with its extensive public transport network and wide variety of telecommunication services.&quot; I could whine about tube delays and how it all packed up in this year&apos;s &quot;snow event&quot;, but that&apos;s not the only issue. Rail tickets are getting more expensive, bus and tube tickets increased by 6% at the start of this year, and huge multi-million pound funding gaps mean tube conditions are unlikely to improve any time soon, meaning commuters will be left cramped and cranky despite paying at least \u00a325 (for travel in zones one and two) or as much as \u00a347 (for zones one to six) a week to use it.

The mindless violence of the mobs, fanned by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in exile, has demolished any claim to being a movement dedicated to restoring democracy. Thaksin \u2013 the ousted billionaire who bought and sold Manchester City during time spent in the UK \u2013 has carefully cultivated the image of being a &quot;persecuted democrat&quot; and victim of the 2006 military coup. But that image has been massively tarnished by his recent performance two weeks ago, inciting &quot;revolution&quot; from his exile in Dubai, egging on the pro-Thaksin mobs in their red-shirts which transformed the capital into a battle zone. The result was not a revolution, but thuggish attacks on the prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva&apos;s car. The anarchy that led to the cancellation of the Asean summit forced the prime minister to invoke a state of emergency on 12 April (lifted on 24 April). The weak coalition government backed by the royalist movement of the &quot;yellow shirts&quot; had come into power as a result of a court decision to dissolve the ruling party for vote-buying and corrupt practices in the last election. Whatever the merits of the pro-Thaksin opposition calling for new elections, many Thai citizens were repelled by the orgy of angry violence. The attempted assassination of Sondhi Limthongkul, one of the leaders of the yellow-shirted PAD (People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy), by heavily armed gumen, is a further block to any chance of a reconciliation between the two movements \u2013 pro-Thaksin &quot;reds&quot; and the anti-Thaksin royalist movement of &quot;yellows&quot; that has so polarised the nation. Thailand has become trapped between two sections of the ruling elite, both lacking real democratic legitimacy. What is happening is not a struggle between a real champion of the rural poor versus the urban rich elite, but rather a bitter feud between two rival wealthy elites. The December 2008 decision of the constitutional court to dissolve the ruling party for electoral fraud helped to catapult the Oxford-educated Abhisit into leadership of a coalition government backed by the royalist movement (who always wear yellow, the colour linked to the the monarchy). The other wing of the Bangkok ruling elite is represented by Thaksin&apos;s new business oligarchy of Chinese-Thai networks backed by the red-shirt supporters. They are able to orchestrate well-funded disruptive mass protests, bankrolling days and weeks of agitation. The red shirts were taking revenge this month for the yellow shirts&apos; shutdown of Bangkok&apos;s international airport for a week in December 2008. Both forces have inflicted vast losses to tourism, exports and trade, sending the Thai economy reeling. But still key issues are unresolved. Rival camps are warily peering into the future and preparing for what is expected to be a messy royal succession, given that the ailing and octogenarian king Bhumibol Adulyadej, the one unifying force, is not expected to live much longer. Neither under Thaksin in his rule of the country from 2001 to 2006, nor under the current coalition government backed by the king&apos;s advisers and the old moneyed classes, has Thailand enjoyed real democracy. Thaksin had used profits from his huge telecom empire to hire some of the world&apos;s top PR companies. Hong Kong-based PR guru Samuel Moon has set up a website for the ousted PM, Building A Better Future Foundation, a name that might fool the gullible into believing that Thaksin had turned into a budding philanthropist. But his record in office was far from democratic according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. His contempt for human rights is indicated in his 2003 &quot;war on drugs&quot;, in which Human Rights Watch reported the deaths of more than 2,000 people (pdf). In reality Thaksin has never believed in democracy any more than other Asian strongmen of the last few decades \u2013 Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew, Malaysia&apos;s Mahathir Mohamad and Cambodia&apos;s Hun Sen. There are some valid grievances that the Democrat party-led coalition government has to address to break the elite stranglehold on politics and to empower the millions in the countryside and the urban poor, who feel their voice is never heard in Bangkok&apos;s ruling circles. Thaksin wooed them, and handed out a few gimmicky benefits, but never really empowered them. Thaksin and his red shirts have suffered a serious setback and were forced to abandon their Bangkok rampage, but they have vowed to return to the streets in the future. Thaksin, a fugitive from a two-year sentence for corruption whose Thai passport has been cancelled, has obtained a passport from Nicaragua and become a financial adviser to the Bahamas and the Central African Republic. Abhisit faces the unpleasant prospect that Thaksin will never give up plotting his return. The stability of the old order in Thailand is over. There is no going back, but is there any way forward? These days, the poor demand to be heard \u2013 the old Thai political order is dead. Despite Abhisit&apos;s elitist origins,his commitment to democracy and dialogue means he may hold the key to bridging the gap between the reds and the yellows. If he can consolidate his government and wean those in the countryside away from Thaksin&apos;s toxic legacy, which has poisoned the country&apos;s capacity for peaceful dialogue, there may be a solution. That would require the Democrat party to transform itself into a vehicle of change, shaking off its elitist origins and delivering some real benefits to the rural poor. And the democratic constitution of 1997 \u2013 trashed both by Thaksin and by the military-appointed regime that succeeded him in 2006 \u2013 has to be rehabilitated. Abhisit&apos;s survival depends on his ability to reach out to the poor and enact social reform, so that he and his coalition will be relevant to a new era of Thai politics in which it will be the poor who eventually decide that Thaksin is also history and they have more to gain from stability and development. A mountain of a task for a young prime minister. But the alternative is a continuation of this cycle of protests, turmoil and in all probability another coup, which is the main reason why even many poor Thai in the countryside hope that Abhisit might just succeed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/apr/30/obituary-tim-kedge", "sentences": ["During his time as a staff member there, Tim took an MA at the University of Leeds and taught in Singapore and the US, where he held a Fulbright visiting professorship in drama for a year at Humboldt State University in California."], "publicationDate": "2009-04-29T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Tim Kedge", "tags": ["Theatre", "Teaching", "Stage", "Culture", "Education"], "article": "My friend Tim Kedge, who has died of leukaemia, aged 59, was a dedicated teacher.

The well-being of Brian Meehan&apos;s colt is not in doubt for the Stan James-sponsored Classic after his fluent victory in the \u00adCraven Stakes last month. The question is whether Delegator is good enough, as the bare form of the \u00adCraven is nothing to get excited about. But he was not beaten far when fifth in last year&apos;s top juvenile race, the Dewhurst Stakes, on just his third start and \u00adDelegator has proved that he has trained on. The same cannot be said of the Aidan O&apos;Brien pair, Rip Van Winkle, who has been the subject of an injury scare this week, or Mastercraftsman, who has been passed over by stable jockey Johnny Murtagh. John Oxx has sounded none too bullish about Sea The Stars, while Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s Evasive has had a few hold-ups. The race could be ripe for an upset, and victory for Jim Bolger&apos;s Gan Amhras would not be a complete surprise, but Delegator (3.10) should be given the chance to show he is a quality colt. Newmarket 2.00 Conqueror of Tartan Bearer here in his two-year-old days, Foolin Myself made a pleasing return to action, after missing last season, when fourth at Newbury. He has Group One entries, so connections will be hoping he can exploit a mark of 86. Goodwood 2.20 Gelded since last term, when he lost his form late on, Dear \u00adMaurice is weighted to go close on his comeback. Trainer Ed Dunlop has his team in good form. Newmarket 2.30 Successful in this Group Two race five times since 1990, Sir Michael Stoute can hit the target again with \u00adSpanish Moon, who was touched off in Group One company in Dubai last time. Like so many of the stable&apos;s top-class horses, \u00adSpanish Moon seems to be getting better with age. Goodwood 3.30 A 7lb hike in the ratings may not be enough to halt Peter Island, who bolted up at Leicester. He showed his liking for this undulating course when running here last season. Newmarket 3.45 There are a few \u00adpotential improvers in this line-up, notably the three-year-old Amour Propre and recent handicap winner Chief Editor, but they will all have to go to get the better of \u00adBorderlescott. A Group One winner last season, he gets in this race without a penalty and, with the rails draw to help him, Robin Bastiman&apos;s tough gelding should be in the firing line from the word go. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Little Pete 5.45 Goodwood The sprint handicap won by Fathom Five at Epsom last month was a competitive affair and Little Pete made a good impression. Running as though the outing was needed, the gelding picked up well in the closing stages to finish seventh. He showed he was effective at this track when narrowly beaten at the big meeting last year off a similar handicap mark. Horse sense Confront will help make Moore all the merrier Sir Michael Stoute and Ryan Moore look set for a successful Guineas weekend, starting with Confront (2.00) in today&apos;s opening race at Newmarket. A smart juvenile, Confront only ran twice last year but he has come back looking stronger then ever and he should enjoy a fruitful four-year-old campaign. Spanish Moon (2.30) and Ave (5.30) are other leading contenders for Stoute and Moore, and the trainer is keen that Evasive takes his chance in the Guineas, despite an interrupted preparation. A lazy home worker, Evasive could make the frame, but Delegator (3.10) is the one to beat. Brian Meehan&apos;s colt has done everything asked of him since winning the Craven Stakes. Amour Propre (3.45) is in good shape for the Palace House Stakes, although Moore should not be far away here on Jeremy Noseda&apos;s Strike The Deal. Infiraad (4.20) can follow up a course and distance win for Barry Hills. This promising colt was far from wound up for last month&apos;s reappearance. Golden Stream (5.00), who looked well in her spin on the Newmarket gallops yesterday morning, and Heaven Sent (2.35) can star for Stoute and Moore on tomorrow&apos;s Newmarket card. They can also go close with Marching Time here, although the William Haggas camp are keen on Mutamaashi (5.35) in this handicap. Shifting Star (3.50) can continue trainer Walter Swinburn&apos;s good run of form, while at Salisbury look out for Brunston (3.25) on his handicap debut for Roger Charlton. Dear Maurice (2.20), disappointing in the second half of last season, has given every encouragement in his recent home work that he can bounce back to form at Goodwood today. Reddy To Star (4.05) and Farncombe (5.15) are others to note here, and Fazbee (7.50) is expected to go well at Doncaster. Seen and heard Overdose, Hungary&apos;s sprinting sensation, is very quick, of that there is no doubt. But he would have had to be jet-propelled to clock a time of 52.6 secs when notching his 12th consecutive victory over five furlongs at Budapest last month. That was later corrected to 54.6s, still a very fast time by this unbeaten colt whose British debut in the Temple Stakes at Haydock three weeks from now will be something to savour. Singapore race fans reckon they have a sprinter to rival Overdose in Rocket Man, who is unbeaten in seven races after winning a Group One event at Kranji last week. He will now go head to head with Takeover Target, last year&apos;s winner, in the Krisflyer Sprint on 17 May, the same day Luca Cumani&apos;s Presvis runs in the Singapore Airlines Cup. No local horse has kept any of Singapore&apos;s international races at home since 2000, but Rocket Man looks a bit special. The John Gosden team has done a tremendous job in keeping a lid on Rainbow View&apos;s explosive temperament. The red-hot 1,000 Guineas favourite was as calm as you like, despite the attentions of a camera crew, when exercising up the Long Hill gallop in Newmarket yesterday morning.

But can you imagine, just for a moment, if Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had overseen the goalless draw which was perceived as ethically objectionable by 90,000 socios? As it was, the critics still managed to summon the spirit of Mourinho (the newspaper AS invoked him as the &quot;devil incarnate&quot;) as if the Portuguese peacock had in some way been responsible for Chelsea&apos;s formidable gameplan. In a way, of course, he was. Any team with a spine of Petr Cech, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba remains forever the team that Jos\u00e9 built. Hiddink provokes nowhere near the froth value that has always been a Mourinho speciality. It is practically impossible to get as worked up by Chelsea&apos;s current chief. He is an expert at taking the heat out of situations, at sounding reasonable, amenable. He knows when to push buttons, but also has a gift for turning potential critics into putty when he feels the occasion demands some anti-septic. Now imagine if Mourinho was the man with the Chelsea microphone during these in-between days separating the two acts of the semi-final. Fun as the tongue twisting might have been, Hiddink&apos;s approach has been to politely deflect away accusations by offering Bar\u00e7a a backhanded compliment. &quot;If we were forced to play as we did it&apos;s a credit to the opponent,&quot; he says calmly, patiently, for the umpteenth time last week. &quot;But I don&apos;t want a team who says: Okay, we cannot achieve what we want to achieve so please take our wallets and run away with them.&quot; Fair enough, no? Few managers have such an instinct for figuring out when to jab, when to retire to the ropes, when to unleash a ferocious uppercut. Hiddink has been doing it his entire career, which is why he is a knockout master. His professional life has been punctuated by some extraordinary sudden- death experiences. It is more than 20 years since he guided PSV Eindhoven to victory in the European Cup. Amazingly they slugged it out in the quarter-final, semi-final, and final without actually winning a game, and only scored twice in those five knife-edge encounters. That was enough. Bordeaux and Real Madrid were both speared by a solitary away goal, and a goalless final against Benfica was claimed on penalties. Fast forward a decade and Hiddink was Holland manager and on the verge of taking his country to the World Cup final. This time the penalties rolled against him after Holland had put in a splendid performance against Brazil in the semi-final. And that extreme contrast is why Hiddink is so hooked by matches of this nature. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be on the wrong side of the knockout,&quot; he says pointedly, mind rewinding to the torment inflicted by Brazil. &quot;The knockout is special circumstances where you can give or take the punch. It&apos;s so tight. So tight.&quot; Does the pain of defeat last longer than joy of victory? Hiddink cannot help but break into a wry smile. &quot;That&apos;s a nice question,&quot; he muses. &quot;I think so. If you are outclassed after a few days you can accept it. But if you are quality-wise better than the opponent and you are kicked out, it hurts more.&quot; Hiddink&apos;s reputation owes much to the fact he has doled out so many heavyweight punches since that nadir in 1998. In creating a South Korea team capable of beating Italy and Spain en route to an unprecedented World Cup semi-final, in dragging Australia to the 2006 tournament at Uruguay&apos;s expense, in delivering one of the most complete international performances of recent years as Russia dismantled Holland at Euro 2008, he thumped out miracle after miracle. The three nations whose football cultures he revolutionised are all, in their own way, somewhat stubborn. Yet they all fell for him in a big way. He is a near deity in South Korea, where he was only half-jokingly proposed as a future president. The Australians, who view sporting excellence as a birthright, wore T-shirts with the slogan &quot;In Guus We Trust&quot;. In Russia he is highly regarded enough for it to be a matter for the Kremlin if Chelsea wish to try to hold on to their loan manager beyond May. That doesn&apos;t happen without a talent for transmitting your ideas in a way that is irresistibly smooth. What Hiddink does so perceptively is measure the temperature of a situation and then manipulate it. A striking example of this occurred when the Australians employed him to negotiate the terror of a play-off against Uruguay with a spot at the 2006 World Cup finals on the line. The team, famously, had endured a play-off disorder for years up to then. He won over the players instantly by being bold and charismatic (he took them all to meet Diego Maradona in Buenos Aires for inspiration), yet recognised what they needed was not somebody to challenge them, but to preach coolness to best use their natural bullishness. He impressed everyone with his handling of a volatile atmosphere in Montevideo. Arriving in Uruguay to a hostile reception, the television cameras crammed around the plane hoping for a grenade to heighten the tension even more. &quot;I just want to say how proud I am to bring a team to the first country to hold the World Cup,&quot; announced Hiddink. The Uruguayans were completely disarmed and the atmosphere diffused. Australia mastered their nerves to win on penalties. The captain, Mark Viduka, was bowled over by Hiddink: &quot;As far as I am concerned, Guus was the missing link for us. He was the leader we needed to take us to the World Cup. He is a tactical genius. Everything he does has a purpose and it makes you feel so comfortable as a player.&quot; Hiddink achieved amazing results in the same way with South Korea. He tried all sorts of tricks to teach an inexperienced bunch how to feel assured enough to punch above their weight. That entailed a global tour in advance of the World Cup to make the team more robust. He realised how inappropriate it was for them to traditionally warm up for a tournament with a round of matches against the likes of Singapore and Malaysia, who they could beat fairly easily. It was time for a massive shock to the system. Pitchside in the stadium at Daejeon just before South Korea so famously humiliated Italy, Hiddink explained how he produced such a monumental improvement. &quot;In the beginning they were so innocent. I thought, &apos;I love you but I could kill you, the way you play so naively.&apos; That&apos;s what I emphasised,&quot; he said. &quot;We made a programme to play in Europe, to invite European and African teams here, and then we went to South America. Because there you get streetwise.&quot; By his own admission, he was sometimes &quot;mean&quot; to the Koreans in training to provoke a reaction. At other times, when they were expecting to sweat, he sent them off to spend time with their families. &quot;When I first came up with that everyone said: &apos;No, no, no! What will the press say?&apos;&quot; Hiddink raises his middle finger as an answer. &quot;From the start I said if you hire me to get the team \u00adcompetitive, these are the consequences. I might fail, but I&apos;d like to fail my way. I&apos;ve not come to fail here your way.&quot; Failure is not something that has cropped up for Hiddink. Now he has a huge match against Barcelona on the horizon and will be psyched up. &quot;I hope to be inspired,&quot; he says, taking a break from the daily regime at Cobham that has invigorated him more than he dares to admit in the past months. &quot;Every day I like to do this job being with the guys on the training ground, but, of course, these games give some extra tension. You&apos;re even sharper than you are normally and I normally want to be very sharp.&quot; And has preparation for the Bar\u00e7a rematch involved practising penalties? &quot;Not long sessions. but every now and then we do,&quot; he says. &quot;Another 0-0 might be possible, and we&apos;ll look which team was playing defensively.&quot; Now that would be touch\u00e9. It&apos;s funny to recall how nobody imagined Avram Grant would be retained at Chelsea even if he won the Champions League. Now, everybody wants Hiddink to remain even if the European campaign ends potless. This is not an act that will be easily followed. He remains steadfast that his main job with Russia is sacred. Every time he meets anyone with a notebook or a TV camera they are obliged to ask him just in case anything has changed, and the latest inquisition just made Hiddink smile, lift up the paper cup of water in front of him, and say: &quot;Cheers.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/05/obituary-lord-moore-of-wolvercote", "sentences": ["Next came service in the far east as a United Kingdom commissioner in Singapore during the difficult years (1961-65) when the newly created Malaysia was, in the face of fierce opposition from neighbouring powers, striving to become an independent state within the Commonwealth."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-04T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Lord Moore of Wolvercote", "tags": ["Monarchy"], "article": "Philip Moore - created Lord Moore of Wolvercote in 1986 - was plucked from the ranks of the civil service in 1966 to be a member of the Queen&apos;s secretariat and eventually, in 1977, her personal private secretary. Moore, who has died aged 88, was the first holder of that post who was not a courtier or of noble birth, and brought to it a freshness, a hard-earned experience of the world and a natural tact which the Queen valued. The son of a British official in the former Indian Raj, indeed born out there, Philip was educated at the Dragon school, Oxford, and Cheltenham college. Awarded a classics exhibition to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1940, he chose not to seek the taste of university life scholars were customarily allowed before war service and straightaway volunteered for the RAF. He trained as a navigator in Bomber Command and flew on a number of operations until, in 1942, his plane suffered a direct hit over France. As he was blown out of the wrecked fuselage, a parachute pack miraculously landed in his lap. He grabbed it and descended safely, the only member of the crew to survive. His luck held at first. He was sheltered by the local French resistance, but then was betrayed to the Germans and spent the next three years as a prisoner of war in Stalag Luft III, famous for its &quot;wooden horse&quot; escape plan - in which he helped - whereby a vaulting horse was kept in constant use by the British PoWs to mask the excavation of a tunnel under the barbed wire.  Taking up his place at Brasenose in 1945 he displayed outstanding sporting prowess. He was an Oxford blue in both rugby and hockey, also playing cricket for Oxfordshire and, in 1951, turning out for England in rugby. Meanwhile he had married Joan Greenop, or Joanna as she preferred, and was launched on his civil service career, initially in the Admiralty. Anticipating his subsequent progress in Buckingham Palace, he wound up as principal private secretary to the First Lord. Next came service in the far east as a United Kingdom commissioner in Singapore during the difficult years (1961-65) when the newly created Malaysia was, in the face of fierce opposition from neighbouring powers, striving to become an independent state within the Commonwealth. Moore was a close friend of the Malaysian leader Lee Kuan Yew. So, Moore went back to London and a desk in the Ministry of Defence until the royal summons came. But Commonwealth issues were again in his in-tray after he ascended to the top job in 1977, when both Australia and Canada were seeking to redefine their relationship with the crown. Moore&apos;s handling of what could have been drastic upsets was widely recognised to have been skilful, discreet and successful. My own experience of his style was on a rather lower plane. In 1974, I had written a book of bogus memoirs, The Last Great Tram Race, which ended with an imaginary sports day at Balmoral for the crowned heads of Europe. I was there as a reporter. When an accident befell the Queen&apos;s allotted partner in the three-legged race I was summarily ordered to take his place. We won, but not before I had enjoyed a moment of trivial intimacy with the pretty young monarch. Rather belatedly, with the book already in the bookshops, my publishers wondered if we might be accused of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. Via a mutual acquaintance I got a discreet inquiry to Moore. He let us know that Her Majesty and Prince Philip had seen the item and were not unamused.  Moore retired at 65 and was rewarded with a life peerage. He took the territorial designation Wolvercote (a quarter of Oxford) in acknowledgment of his education there, though friends recalled that Wolvercote also boasted his favourite pub, the Trout. He continued to serve on a wide variety of public bodies, charities and schools, but as the years went by appreciated more and more life with Joanna in their grace-and-favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace, Surrey. He liked to show his visitors around the premises and point out where the ghost of Anne Boleyn might be seen.  He is survived by his wife, their two daughters, and his sister, the actor Daphne Field. \u2022 Philip Brian Cecil Moore, Baron Moore of Wolvercote, civil and royal servant, born 6 April 1921; died 7 April 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2009/may/05/climate-change-recession-nicholas-stern", "sentences": ["The report examines a wide range of climate change impacts in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-05T07:10:00Z", "title": "Nicholas Stern and Haruhiko Kuroda on why global warming could make or break south-east Asia", "tags": ["Climate change", "Nicholas Stern", "Recession", "World news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Business"], "article": "In the middle of this financial crisis there is a debate taking place over whether governments can afford both massive tax-funded spending programmes needed to revive ailing economies, and the emissions cuts that are needed to combat climate change. Few regions on Earth throw this tension into sharper contrast than south-east Asia, where many nations are highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming while also having the chance to develop low-carbon economies. The plain truth is that nations can no longer afford to delay action on climate change, even temporarily, and such spending can serve as effective fiscal stimulus. Despite the global economic downturn the world is still warming. A major new report from the Asian Development Bank \u2013 The Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia: A Regional Review \u2013 explains how countries that invest now in climate change adaptation will better protect their people, economy and environment. Even with aggressive adaptation efforts, the negative impacts of climate change will continue to worsen. Only concerted global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can ultimately steer the world off its current calamitous course. The report examines a wide range of climate change impacts in Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It finds a &quot;business as usual&quot; approach will result in a difficult future for the region and its people. By the end of this century temperatures in south-east Asia will rise significantly, tens of millions will experience water shortages, rice production will decline, and large swaths of forests will disappear. Rising sea levels will force the relocation of millions of island dwellers and coastal communities, and there will be a surge in dengue, malaria and other diseases. With population centres and economic activity concentrated along south-east Asia&apos;s coastlines and livelihoods particularly dependent on agriculture, fishing and natural resources, the region is acutely vulnerable. Adopting a similar modelling approach to that used in the 2007 Stern Review, the report concludes the region is twice as economically vulnerable to climate change compared with the rest of the world. The good news is that far from the world&apos;s policy makers being captive to the economic crisis, the opposite is true: the crisis may offer opportunities if we can boost programmes to improve water, sanitation, climate-proofing and reduce carbon dependency and protect forests. At their recent London Summit, G20 leaders agreed that current stimulus programmes should be used to foster a green, sustainable recovery. As was outlined in the recent joint report from the UK&apos;s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy \u2013 an outline of the case for a &quot;green&quot; stimulus \u2013 energy efficient and low carbon technologies are not simply means for reducing carbon emissions. They are also extremely effective as a fiscal stimulus because they can be implemented quickly and are relatively labour intensive. For Asia&apos;s governments, these kinds of public investments, in both adaptation and mitigation, will be essential to eradicating extreme poverty, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and making structural transformations that are needed to place the region on a low-carbon path. Over the next 50 years, much of the world&apos;s new energy and urban infrastructure will be built in Asia, locking in the region&apos;s greenhouse gas emission pattern. Encouragingly, there are vast, untapped opportunities for energy efficiency improvements, cleaner transport, and for increasing the use of renewable energy sources including biomass, solar, wind, hydro and geothermal. Some of these schemes can be financed through the government&apos;s own fiscal stimulus programmes, others with international assistance, including both additional funding sources and the transfer of knowledge and technologies. That might seem like a lot to ask in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But the benefits will be enormous. We have no time to delay. The financial crisis will come to an end. Without action, the same cannot be said for climate change. \u2022 Lord Stern is chairman of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment and the IG Patel professor of economics and government at the London School of Economics.

To reach the dirt yard where he lay dreaming, I picked my way through the half-crumbled concrete spars of an unfinished church, two storeys high. It had no roof, walls or floor. Baby goats tottered between the pillars while women hung washing from its beams. Ekang woke easily, swung upright and patted a place for me on the bench where he&apos;d been sleeping. He&apos;s a preacher and he spoke fluently, as if he&apos;d known my questions in advance. The unfinished church of St Patrick of Christ, he said, was about to be knocked down. &quot;They&apos;re going to demolish the whole structure soon, because it&apos;s a death trap,&quot; he said. His father had begun to build it, then died. He pointed to a lone whitewashed tomb in the bare ground on the far side of the yard. &quot;That&apos;s his grave over there.&quot;  Even here in Ajegunle, the biggest, toughest inner-city slum in Lagos, the plot where the unfinished church stands is valuable as building land. Once there was a government plan to raze Ajegunle and let its residents scatter as best they could. It wasn&apos;t carried out; but Ajegunle has never sensed more nervously the heave and crush of the metropolis coiled around it. Nigeria is Africa&apos;s most populous country, and if Lagos hasn&apos;t yet overtaken Cairo as Africa&apos;s biggest city, it will. The dread of sudden eviction chafes deep into the already hard, dollar-a-day lives of the people who call Ajegunle home. &quot;They came here this afternoon,&quot; Ekang said. &quot;They&apos;re going to destroy some houses by the canal. OK, make Lagos like London or America, but make provision for them. There are virgin lands where you can resettle these people. Everyone&apos;s afraid. Everyone&apos;s sleeping with one eye open.&quot; Ekang led me through earth-paved alleys barely two metres wide, lined with a collage of concrete, timber and rusty metal sheets behind which thousands of people sleep at night, squeezed into tiny rooms, bursting out in daytime to trade, strive and hustle. We came out at the edge of one of Lagos&apos;s canals. Both banks were obscured by a thick, grey mulch of rubbish made up of plastic, paper and cloth. Grubby white cattle egrets picked over it in the shade of trees that seemed no less intensely green for having their roots embedded in Ajegunle&apos;s middens. Down the canal, jerry-built walkways stretched out on to the water to long-drop latrines. There was a bakery close to the water&apos;s edge. Through the open doorway I glimpsed the puff of flour in the cool dimness. Outside, sitting on the ground with their backs to the wall, staring miserably out at the canal, were the bakers. The previous day, the bakery, which never had a legal right to be in that place but had stood there for years, had been served with an &quot;abatement of nuisance notice&quot; by the Lagos government&apos;s Office of Drainage Services. In three days the bakery and neighbouring houses would be knocked down. There was nothing they could do about it, and no alternative land would be provided; they were on their own. &quot;We have nowhere to go,&quot; said Ismail Lasisa, who had worked in the bakery for five years. &quot;At the moment we&apos;re making money from the bakery - this is where we toil, our daily bread. Now there&apos;s no more bread.&quot; It&apos;s a trend. Just after New Year, police and a government team called Kick Against Indiscipline descended without warning on the illegal hive of commerce that sprawled across the main highway from Lagos airport at Oshodi junction. Thousands of small traders shrieked and wept impotently as their stalls and goods were demolished by bulldozers and burned.  To Ekang, the ruthless demolition of illegal or semi-legal homes and businesses manifests the willpower of one man: Babatunde Fashola, a 45-year-old lawyer who was elected governor of Lagos in 2007. Most Lagosians I talked to see it the same way. The middle classes love him. But governors come and go. What doesn&apos;t change is the overwhelming, inexorable force each has to grapple with, the force that smashes buildings and builds new ones, squeezes people into ever smaller spaces or makes them move miles from where they grew up, jams the roads, smogs the air, fouls the water, magnifies fortunes, atomises individuals - the force of the city&apos;s swelling population. The rate at which Nigeria&apos;s population has increased, and continues to increase, is staggering. In 1950, 10 years before it gained independence from Britain, 34 million people lived here. The UN believes there are now almost 150 million Nigerians; it has become the world&apos;s eighth most populous country, bigger than Russia or Japan. Between now and the middle of the century, only India will add more people to the world&apos;s population. If you want to see what it means to live in the middle of a population explosion - the kind of generational leap in size that happened in London in the 19th century and New York in the 20th - Lagos is the ideal place. Where, I wondered, do all the extra people go? Our planet passed an extraordinary turning point last year. For the first time in history, more people worldwide live in towns and cities than in the countryside. In the next four decades, the world population is expected to rise from six to nine billion people. All of that increase, the UN predicts, will be urban; the rural population will shrink. It is not only the developing world megacities - Mumbai, Dhaka, Calcutta, Karachi, Kinshasa, Cairo and Lagos - that are experiencing the same problems and groping for solutions. There are hundreds of vast cities, little known outside their own countries, expanding out of the global eye. China has close to 100 cities with more than a million inhabitants; India has 40. Medan, Surabaya, Semarang, Palembang and Ujung Pandang - chances are you haven&apos;t heard of all or any of them, but each is an Indonesian city with more than a million people. Nigeria itself has seven more million-plus cities after Lagos. They are being built by capitalism, corruption and class warfare, rather than by planners; by forces deeper and older than market forces - family forces. Ambition, as well as desperation, has driven migrants to the cities for millennia. That journey made Europe. And as alarming as it is to look forward to a world in which six billion people live in cities - many of them, perhaps, resembling Lagos more than Singapore - the future that was predicted for the developing world four decades ago was bleaker. In the late 60s, it was widely forecast that the world couldn&apos;t expand food production fast enough to cope with the planet&apos;s soaring population. Taking his cue from the 19th-century English clergyman Thomas Malthus, American entomologist Paul Ehrlich published a bestselling book, The Population Bomb, that forecast mass starvation. &quot;The battle to feed all of humanity is over,&quot; he wrote. &quot;In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programmes embarked upon now. At this late date, nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.&quot; It may yet happen - but it didn&apos;t happen. The prophet who has been right up till now is the Danish economist Ester B\u00f6serup, who died in 1999. She pointed out that people in poor countries can be just as capable of adapting to change as their rich world cousins. She predicted, correctly, that societies threatened by population explosions and hunger would have the wit to seek ways of growing more food and having fewer babies. She also foresaw the scale of despair and dog-eat-dog struggle in cities such as Lagos. A country that doesn&apos;t invest in infrastructure nationwide, uses its oil wealth to import food and puts cities ahead of the countryside will end up, B\u00f6serup said, with &quot;an over-dimensional metropolis in a country of rural misery&quot;. The city&apos;s vastness is beyond dispute. Lagos looks from space like a giant sack of flour that has been dropped on the hard floor of the Atlantic coast, split open and spread out, 40 miles wide and 20 miles deep. Yet its exact size is a politically charged question. The national census organisation says the city and the rest of Lagos state around it have just over nine million people. Lagos makes a convincing case that it has 18 million which, if true, would make it the sixth biggest urban sprawl in the world - bigger than Delhi. The grime and neglect of Lagos&apos;s public realm is not unchallenged. The classic Lagos drains, for instance - open channels between roads and shopfronts, straddled by makeshift footbridges, usually blocked, abrim with black standing water, bubbling ominously - are being replaced with covered drains made of concrete shells. The mounds of burning trash that used to wreathe the city in smoke and stink have disappeared, partly because Lawma, the Lagos Waste Management Authority, now pays freelance scavengers, by weight, for the rubbish they collect. Lagos&apos;s population is growing by half a million every year. The city has no central sewage system for human waste, and those houses that do have toilets use septic tanks. Lagos has a little over half of the treatment plants it needs to process the output from the tanks; the trucks carrying the rest simply empty the sewage into the lagoon. Ola Oresanya, head of Lawma, said his crews were collecting 9,000 tonnes of trash every day - not far short of London&apos;s 12,000 tonnes, in a much richer city. Could he imagine a day when Lagos might have to say, &quot;Enough - no more people&quot;? &quot;It might come,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d call it &apos;re-ordering the growth pattern&apos;. Poor people who see open space put up market stalls. Now they&apos;re being moved out of the area and the government is putting better infrastructure in. This is redefining the cost of living in these areas. It&apos;s not a matter of saying to people, &apos;You can&apos;t come any more...&apos; &quot; One day I went looking for the growing edge of Lagos, the place where, as I naively imagined it, I&apos;d see a vanguard of scaffolding and building materials spreading out into untouched bush, with the newest districts of the city right behind them. I thought of a city growing like mould on fruit, an expanding circle. I had forgotten that cities don&apos;t grow like that in the age of the car. They grow like ivy, shooting out roads for tendrils, sprouting leaf-like settlements and businesses off that narrow line. The most urgent tendril of Lagos now is the four-lane highway that reaches out from the old colonial heart of the city, Lagos Island - with the down-at-heel skyscrapers of the 80s business district at one end, the rich post-colonial residences of Ikoyi at the other - across Five Cowrie Creek, through the smart new banking and shopping district of Victoria Island and on east into the Lekki peninsula. To aspirational Lagosians - that is to say, all of them - the word &quot;Lekki&quot; provokes both hope and despair. It conjures up a dream of space, of an affordable family house where children can breathe and stretch out; and a nightmare of hours - four or five a day is common - spent in gridlock on the highway, commuting to work in a city where the car is king. Taibat Lawanson, a young mother who teaches at the urban planning department of the University of Lagos, moved to Lekki. She told me she had to get up at five to be at work by eight. &quot;If I don&apos;t leave work by four, I don&apos;t get home before 11. But that&apos;s where we got land to build, and it&apos;s really peaceful at the weekend. At least the children can go out and play. It&apos;s a small sacrifice to make so they can have a childhood rather than being cooped up in a flat in the centre of town.&quot; The land on either side of the Lekki highway has been fought over, parcelled out, sold, but much of it is not yet built on. Unpaved roads shoot off into the bush towards new housing developments. Reeds grow out of stagnant ponds filled with rubbish. Traders sell bricks, planks, giant steel staples, gates by the roadside. Land fraud - people selling land they don&apos;t own, building on land that hasn&apos;t been sold - is rife.  The road, lined with banks and churches, reminded me of Texas. A dialogue between Christ and Mammon sputters at the expressway&apos;s edge. Jesus - The Answer. Zenith Bank. Skye Bank. Mountains of Fire and Miracles Ministry. Gracespring Chapel (Oil of Gladness Ministries Inc). GT Bank. EcoBank. Consuming Fire Christian Ministry. In many ways, Lagos is a rightwing Texan&apos;s paradise: rich or middle-class families are resigned to doing everything for themselves, spurning a venal and incompetent government. There&apos;s little public transport, so you drive. The state schools aren&apos;t good, so you aspire to send your children to a private school. There are few landlines, so you have mobile phones. There is almost no central water supply, so you dig your own well. There are no sewers, so you have a septic tank. Mains electricity works only a few hours a day, so you have your own generator. No money? Work harder, pray harder, get better cronies. The standard car licence plate motto reads, &quot;Lagos: Centre of Excellence&quot;, but a slogan I saw painted on the back of a taxi seemed better to match the Lagosian ethos: &quot;No Money, No Friend&quot;. I called on Mudashiru Lawal, hereditary chief of Igbara, an area at the heart of the Lekki land rush. A plumber by trade, he lives in a small, two-storey house he calls his palace, amid the same ad hoc sprawl of wood and concrete structures, half-house, half-shop, that I saw in Ajegunle. The palace is being extended. As we talked, some of the chief&apos;s sons came to the threshold and prostrated themselves, the traditional Yoruba form of deference. When the chief was a boy, he lived in the country. Now, at 60, he lives in Lagos. He hasn&apos;t moved, but the city has. In his childhood, the peninsula was cut by lakes, inlets and swamps. The family would gather coconuts and take them to Lagos on foot and by canoe. &quot;All our father are making farm,&quot; the chief said. &quot;When we come, making farm with them together. And every area that we were making farm been taken over by government building houses. All where we were making coconut farm, no more again. Farm for yam, for rice: no more again. Even to go to lagoon and fish: no more again... We have to move. We have to progress. But the progress is too fast. We don&apos;t know where we are going.  &quot;We have to think of tomorrow; that if we die, where are we going to sleep?&quot; I didn&apos;t understand what he meant until I realised that, in the race to build houses on Lekki, developers and the government have - besides all the other essential services they haven&apos;t provided, such as a hospital - failed to set aside a place to bury the dead. It&apos;s an article of faith in Lagos that the city&apos;s population growth is caused by migrants, yet the chief has four wives, 12 children, 12 grandchildren and hundreds of nieces and nephews. His patrimony cannot provide for them all and they have had to scatter to other parts of the city&apos;s periphery. Some of his daughters live in Badagry, a satellite town on the opposite side of Lagos. Most modern cities have three ways to grow - outwards to suburbs, upwards to the sky or inwards to more crowded homes and smaller rooms. The high-rise route is difficult for Lagos - the electricity shortage means people don&apos;t trust lifts - and the move inwards doesn&apos;t affect only the poor in rookeries such as Ajegunle. As their families grow, the middle classes face hard choices. &quot;Where I live, when I moved there in 1995,&quot; said Dom Okori, the eminently middle-class head of the Socio Economic Rights Initiative, an organisation that campaigns on behalf of slum dwellers, &quot;there were four units of housing occupied by four families. It looked palatial. It was very well built. At that point I paid 150,000 naira (\u00a3685) a year. Today I&apos;m paying 800,000 (\u00a33,651) a year. The place that used to house four families now houses 12. It&apos;s like a barracks. The alternative is you go out to the outskirts.&quot; There is a master plan for the area, including a new airport in Lekki and a network of commuter railways, but it has already been overtaken by the city&apos;s rampant growth. Lagos, Leke Oduwaye at the university&apos;s planning department said, knew neither what it was, nor what it ought to be. &quot;Why is the government trying to impose on our cities the developed world model of how a city should look? They&apos;re shying away from the fact that our economy is not as advanced as those countries&apos;. We don&apos;t have an economy that can adapt to all those big supermarkets. We buy things when we&apos;re going home from work. People don&apos;t earn much, don&apos;t have savings, they have to buy every day because there isn&apos;t enough electricity for a freezer. By the time it comes together, this is what you end up with; this dirty, fragmented city is what the economy can carry for now. If we shy away from that, then we continue to inflict pain on our people.&quot; For Nigerians, of course, having many children doesn&apos;t count as a failure; on the contrary, to Nigerians, I - childless at 46 - am the unsuccessful one. And, as financial factors replace the need for work hands in families, Nigerian birth rates are dropping sharply. Men are more likely to think twice about taking additional wives (tolerated by Nigerian Christians as well as by Muslims). But the baby bulge will take decades to work through. Ajegunle may be Lagos&apos;s biggest slum, but its most visible - just around the corner from the shabby-genteel central district of Yaba - is Makoko. It&apos;s hard to miss. It lies under one of the city&apos;s main bridges, the twisting motorway carrying traffic from Lagos Island to the mainland. It is smelled as much as seen. Sometimes you smell burning from the Ebute Metta lumber yards next door, acres of shacks in the haze; sometimes a stench of rancid fish from the fishing families whose houses on stilts are spreading out into the black, contaminated waters of the lagoon; sometimes - a much rarer smell in the streets of Lagos than the fastidious European might imagine - the plain guff of human shit. On Makoko Road one Friday morning, yellow mini-buses and tuk-tuks bounced in and out of the ruts. Schoolchildren in purple blouses, green wimples or shorts stalked dreamily through the crowds on their way to the local state schools. A local head teacher assured me that state schools were absolutely free, and that they&apos;d take any child who wanted to enrol, but it&apos;s not that simple; by constantly pressuring the poorest parents for contributions to make the state school better - 100 naira (46p) to repair toilets here, 100 for extra books there - the better-off parents force the poorest parents out. The strain of the growing number of poor children, their parents ever more desperate to educate them, is taken up by private schools such as St Mary&apos;s in Makoko, which will squeeze in a child for around \u00a310-\u00a315 a term. I visited St Mary&apos;s one morning, walking down an alley where families were washing in basins heated on open fires. The school is a shed roughly seven metres by three, made of rough planks nailed together and a corrugated metal roof, with no electricity, no water, no window glass and a dirt floor. Into this space six teachers and more than 100 children in six classes are squeezed, without partitions except a couple of blackboards. In one tiny space in the middle of the room, crammed shoulder to shoulder on three benches, a class of 17 was being taught algebra. They listened with furious concentration, writing down everything in jotters with slow, round, loving loops on their Gs and Ys, as the teacher waved a dog-eared book entitled General Mathematics, yelling to make himself heard over the noise of the other teachers. Fixed to the wall behind him was a poster showing photographs of a man on a stirring progress through life. &quot;OBAMA 1st American Black President,&quot; it said. &quot;Every day people do come from outside, and at the same time the number of children is increasing every day,&quot; said Ita Edet, the head. &quot;If you count the population this morning and come again tomorrow, you see it will increase.&quot; Outside there was the beat of a drum as a funeral procession went past, and the kindergarten children at one end of the shed jumped up, giggling, and began to dance. On my way in, I&apos;d seen a group of laughing locals pelt each other with flour in celebration of a birth. Perhaps it was honours even for mortality in Makoko that day. As the district becomes more crowded, illness and malnutrition prevail. A clinic near the school, set up by Dominicans nine years ago, is seldom patronised because local people can&apos;t afford the drugs, even though they are half price. The clinic&apos;s matron, Livina Nwabu, spoke of chronic diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, typhoid, malaria and measles, often exacerbated by treatment with native remedies. With large families living in single rooms, isolating the infected was impossible. Her experienced eyes saw the symptoms of too many mouths to feed. &quot;There are many children here who are starving.&quot; I went back to Makoko two days later. It was cooler after the rains. It was a Sunday. Two small girls in the long white dresses of the local church raced past me on what was, judging by their faces, a serious angelic mission. Their bare feet made a soft pattering sound on the mud. I went to see Bumi Lott, a 38-year-old mother of six children, four of whom are at St Mary&apos;s. She and her husband between them earn about \u00a3100 a month as prophets at the Holy Ghost Church of God; a quarter of that, she estimates, goes on education. Sometimes she and her husband go short so the children get three meals a day. Here was another answer to the question, &quot;Where do all the extra people go?&quot; The family, all eight of them, live in a single room with chicken wire on the windows, a shoe tidy hanging from a blue-painted wall and a double bed. There is about a metre of additional space on two sides of the bed. Before praying for me and my colleague Sam, the prophetess outlined her vision for the future. &quot;I pray not to die here,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope to build my own house some day. The important thing is education. I want my children to have an education. I&apos;m hoping one will become a doctor, one will become a pharmacist, one will become a nurse. I&apos;m hoping that my children will move abroad, and when life is good for them, they will say, &apos;Mum, come join us&apos;.&quot; A young boy came in and looked at the visitors in surprise. He must have been 10. &quot;This is Michael,&quot; Bumi Lott said. &quot;He&apos;s going to be a doctor.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/10/ireland-financial-crisis-emigration", "sentences": ["In the late 1980s, economists close to Fianna F\u00e1il, the broadly centrist political party that has clung to power like few others in Europe, had slashed taxes, regulations and corporate rates in order to make Ireland third only to Hong Kong and Singapore as the world&apos;s most free-market country."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-09T23:01:00Z", "title": "Ireland: As the Celtic Tiger roars its last, Ruaridh Nicoll reports on fear of an Exodus from Ireland", "tags": ["Ireland", "Young people", "Society", "Recession", "Business", "Europe"], "article": "Driving north from Waterford, Michael Dermody and I are caught for a moment in a beautiful light. The sun has fallen into a gap between clouds that have dulled the day, and the farmlands of County Kilkenny. &quot;That&apos;ll be your last Irish sunset for a while,&quot; I say, for the 25-year-old is on his way to Dublin airport, and then to Rome, Bangkok and finally Perth, Western Australia. He looks away. &quot;There will be a lot of lasts now,&quot; he replies, &quot;but I don&apos;t look at life like that.&quot; For 15 years, as the Celtic tiger has leapt and growled, the Irish countryside has been sustained by developers who, on a credit binge fed by bankers, have built and built and built. There was a belief that, at long last, the humiliations of the past were over. Anyone who warned of a bubble was abused, not least by the former Taoiseach, or prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who said, &quot;I don&apos;t know how people who engage in [moaning] don&apos;t commit suicide.&quot; I first met Michael before Christmas, while researching an article about the Gaelic sport of hurling. The team sheets listed occupations: carpenters, plumbers, masons. &quot;It used to be that my friends wanted to go to college, then they started dropping out of school and taking on apprenticeships,&quot; he&apos;d told me. &quot;They were paid \u20ac1,000 a week and they were only 20 years old. They blew it all; out every weekend, nice car, nice clothes. They didn&apos;t think it would end.&quot; But end it has. Each village we pass is home to empty apartment blocks. The wound of emigration - which seeped for decades, even centuries - has reopened. &quot;A couple of years ago, I might have known two people in the whole of Australia,&quot; Michael says. &quot;Now I know 30.  I have about five or six friends in Perth alone, all from within 10 miles of my house.&quot; As I travel round Ireland, I will be told that the boom has changed the country for ever and, what with modern air travel, the exodus this time will be temporary. Yet technology, in the form of Facebook and Skype, is a powerful new agent in the emptying of villages. &quot;Those who go are in contact with the lads back home,&quot; Michael says. &quot;They are telling us what a good time they are having, asking, &apos;What&apos;s keeping you?&apos;&quot; The network that has always been so important in Ireland - those ties of kinship and geography - now sucks the young away.  A little while before, Michael stood up from the farmhouse table, picked up a small rucksack and his hurling sticks, and said he&apos;d best be going. His mother sat straight-backed, the pain hard in her eyes, her jaw set, as her son had a last gulp of tea. He tells me later that his parents &quot;hadn&apos;t really spoken&quot; about his departure, &quot;but my mother is unhappy&quot;. This renewed emigration, after 15 years of migrants returning, horrifies the older generations. They know all it will take is a good job, a mortgage or a marriage to keep Michael abroad. &quot;They want to know when I&apos;ll be back, but I don&apos;t really know,&quot; he says, as we head into the darkness. &quot;If it doesn&apos;t work out in Perth, I wouldn&apos;t be averse to New Zealand.&quot;  On Dublin&apos;s Custom House Quay, six starving figures stagger towards an invisible ship. Or perhaps, given that the statues recalling the famine were erected using money raised by, among others, Ireland&apos;s new rich, they are heading towards Shrewsbury Road. No street shows just how far from poverty the country has come, or better embodies the extraordinary distances some will go in search of affirmation. The houses may be lovely - for the most part redbrick, substantial and sitting in generous lawns - but they are far from palatial. Yet in 2005, a home here sold for \u20ac58m. There are plenty of astonishing figures in this boom. There were 6,507 racehorses in training in Ireland in 1992, yet by 2008 some 12,119 thoroughbreds were kicking up the gallops. From four private aircraft, the numbers of helicopters and jets rose to an estimated 80, with more being bought in Ireland than in any other EU country. Where once there were only a few thousand people who could afford to follow Munster&apos;s rugby players abroad, an estimated 65,000 arrived in Cardiff in 2006 to watch them become European champions.  And now? Well, in the 2006 census there were 200,000 empty homes, a figure that will now have significantly worsened. Horses are being offered to trainers by hard-up owners, or being left by the side of the road, or even shot. &quot;All those planes and helicopters are for sale,&quot; I am told by one businessman.  Still, for many, the good times had been grand. In the late 1980s, economists close to Fianna F\u00e1il, the broadly centrist political party that has clung to power like few others in Europe, had slashed taxes, regulations and corporate rates in order to make Ireland third only to Hong Kong and Singapore as the world&apos;s most free-market country. The move, satirised by journalists as the &quot;Doheny &amp; Nesbitt School of Economics&quot;, after the pub they claim had given birth to it, would see 40 per cent of all American money invested in Europe wash up on Ireland&apos;s shores.  Ireland had two booms, explains Fintan O&apos;Toole, commentator, critic and historian. The first came in the 1990s. Foreign investment offered work and opportunities to the well-educated, English-speaking workforce. The whole country rose on the tide, and many of those who emigrated in the 1980s came home. As the millennium turned, however, a parasite embedded itself in the economy. Recessionary interest rates set by the European Central Bank allowed Irish bank executives to borrow huge sums, which they lent to their chums in the property business (and sometimes to themselves). When Anglo Irish Bank, the worst offender, called in the government in December 2008, it had lent 15 people more than \u20ac500m each. This money fuelled an explosive burst of confidence. A series of spectacular new buildings appeared downstream from those starving figures on the banks of the Liffey. The &quot;Builders&quot;, as the big property developers are called, sold land to each other at spiralling prices. These men - they were all men - whose fathers might have ended up working on English construction sites, were commissioning skyscrapers not just in Ireland, but in New York, Chicago and London, arrowing around the globe on Falcon jets. They set an example that every Irishman who had ever put mortar to brick followed. The Builders became glamour figures. In 1999, one of the most notorious bought a plot, perhaps a quarter of an acre, in Shrewsbury Road for Ir\u00a33m, and then promptly sued the neighbour who had sold it to him in a boundary dispute. As he built his house, Sean Dunne, 54, compact, likeable, with neatly groomed grey hair and small, terrifying blue eyes, must have sensed he was where he wanted to be, a long way from his childhood in County Carlow, in southeast Ireland, where, as he once put it, &quot;If me or my siblings needed a bath we went for a swim in the River Slaney.&quot; Dunne would fly close to an economy burning like the sun. He caught the country&apos;s imagination in 2004 when he followed his wedding to a gossip columnist with a 14-day celebration in Italy aboard the Cristina O, Aristotle Onassis&apos;s old yacht, complete with guests such as rugby international Ronan O&apos;Gara and fashion designer Karen Millen. It was &quot;redolent of nothing so much as The Great Gatsby,&quot; cooed the Sunday Independent, with a mixture of awe and sarcasm. Dunne then stunned the public with the purchase, at the height of the boom, of seven acres of Dublin&apos;s fancy Ballsbridge neighbourhood for \u20ac379m. He planned to raise a &quot;diamond-cut skyscraper&quot; of 37 storeys. Much of the country was going crazy. The German ambassador caused a diplomatic incident when he complained that Irish life had become coarse. The church, so long a moral force, was silent, muzzled by a succession of scandals involving paedophilia and the abuse of children in care. To explain what had happened, Fintan O&apos;Toole takes me to Les Fr\u00e8res Jacques, a restaurant opposite Dublin castle that &quot;in better times&quot;, he says, had been a favourite of poets. When we visit, it is empty. &quot;Our story was one of failures since independence,&quot; he explains. &quot;In the 1950s, there were serious analysts saying there would be no one left on the island. In the 1980s, the Irish Development Agency put up a poster at the airport showing a graduation class of University College Dublin, and it said, &apos;We are the young Europeans&apos;. A year later it turned out that every person in the poster was gone. &quot;When your young are leaving, there&apos;s a sense of national inferiority, of failure,&quot; O&apos;Toole explains. &quot;You know at a fundamental level that the country isn&apos;t working. At a familial level, it&apos;s awful. It leaves a pretty deep scar. Then when people start coming back, there is a very tangible sense of change, of hope.&quot; According to O&apos;Toole, &quot;People bought into the idea that this wasn&apos;t just an economic boom - it was a national vindication, a healing, the sense that our bad past was gone, and gone for ever.&quot; But he warns against confusing a sense of humiliation with an understanding of the past: &quot;One of the most ridiculous clich\u00e9s about the Irish is that we are obsessed with history. In recent decades it&apos;s been the opposite; we have been living in a continual present, in the sense that now is the only place that ever existed.&quot; On 6 October 2003, in Goatstown, a suburb of Dublin, one of the winners in Ireland&apos;s boom met one of the losers, and for both, that moment was surely all that had ever existed. Charlie Chawke had just carried the weekend takings from his pub, the Goat, to his car - it was more than \u20ac48,000. &quot;I looked into my mirror and saw this guy coming at me with a sawn-off shotgun hanging from his left shoulder,&quot; he says. &quot;He opened the car door and said, &apos;Give me the effing money.&apos; I could see the gun and I went for it. I was a hurler in my time and fancied my chances.&quot;  Charlie isn&apos;t a man who takes much notice of lessons of history, and so, in his way, he embodies the change that swept through Ireland over the past 20 years. He was raised behind the bar in his father&apos;s pub in the village of Adare, outside the western city of Limerick. He moved to Dublin and, a natural-born gambler, bought the Goat. He used the leverage offered by the banks to expand and, it&apos;s fair to say, enjoy himself. Now he is part-owner of Sunderland football club, a shareholder in Celtic, and owner of eight pubs across Ireland. The first point to be made about Charlie is that by 2003 he was a millionaire, possibly many times over. There was no need for him to fight, but he fancied his chances. But then, like many of his compatriots, he&apos;s not a man to put much store in the lessons of history. He missed the gun. &quot;I fell. So, I was lying on the ground and he said, &apos;Ach, you&apos;re a smartarse,&apos; and he put the gun to my knee and blew the whole knee away.&quot; Charlie nearly died on the road as his staff attempted to stem the flow of blood with a tablecloth.  Point two about Charlie is that he seems to know everyone. He was, for example, once friends with Sean Dunne. In fact, as the Builder pushed for planning permission for his 37-storey diamond-cut dream in Ballsbridge, Charlie took over a bar on the site. That didn&apos;t end well either. Dunne grew dissatisfied by the value of the contract and wanted more. Charlie refused, and so his staff were locked out of Dunne&apos;s hotel on the very day his daughter was getting married in Adare. &quot;He ruined my daughter&apos;s wedding,&quot; says Charlie. &quot;And I can never forgive that.&quot; Point three about Charlie is that he remains gloriously unembarrassed by the clique at the heart of Irish life, and the part he played in it. To discover why, we talk about a horse called Forpadydeplasterer. In 2007, Charlie had an idea while driving back from the Galway races, an annual jamboree infamous for its swirl of money, politics, traded favours and drink. The then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern - &quot;a very nice man and a good friend of mine&quot; - was having a few problems over undeclared donations. Asked to name the donors, Ahern had caused hilarity by identifying one, now a wealthy developer, as Paddy the Plasterer. &quot;I thought, &apos;Now that&apos;s a great name for a horse,&apos;&quot; says Charlie. So Charlie bought a horse and called it Forpadydeplasterer, and because Charlie had also given Ahern money, unkind observers have suggested this might constitute two fingers up to the authorities. And then what happens? Forpadydeplasterer wins the Arkle Chase at Cheltenham.  &quot;We&apos;re a very small country and if I want something done, somebody&apos;ll know somebody who&apos;ll do me a turn,&quot; says Charlie. &quot;And maybe that has been part of the problem. We find it hard to refuse people. I know in my business if somebody comes in and needs 500 quid, they get it, and they&apos;d expect to get it.&quot; And as it goes with Charlie, so it went with Ireland. The Builders went into see their friends in the banks and the money was handed over. They got it, and they expected to get it. Of course, not everyone made beasts of themselves. So far this has been the story of machismo, yet among the Irish middle classes, there were great benefits from a strengthening economy. &quot;There is an expectation that everybody made money in property, but many of us didn&apos;t,&quot; gallery owner Josephine Kelliher tells me. &quot;We did well, in that we had steady jobs and bonuses. We were able to do pretty ordinary things: two holidays a year, buy a painting, put on an extension.&quot;  But Josephine, like many professionals, now finds the country she thought she knew dramatically changed: &quot;I am very disappointed, and embarrassed. People genuinely had no idea this level of mismanagement was going on.&quot; Josephine left business school in 1989 and opened a contemporary art gallery, so had the perfect view on an extraordinary transformation. &quot;Starting in 1996, there was a huge influx of people who&apos;d worked abroad all their adult lives and had expected to stay abroad for ever,&quot; she says. &quot;They were in their 30s and 40s, and certainly, I had never expected to see their return.&quot; The consequent cultural renaissance allowed her to prosper, building up clients, often through the architects working the space between Dublin&apos;s cultural life and the Builders. She wasn&apos;t alone. The gay scene, so long hidden, burst out and took its rightful place in society. But now, the architects are going bust.  So who is to blame for all this? The Builders? Well, only a fool would have mistaken them for angels. The banks? Certainly, Sean FitzPatrick, Anglo Irish&apos;s ex-chairman, makes Sir Fred Goodwin look prudent. But as O&apos;Toole argues, such conjecture is to let the guilty go free: &quot;To place all the blame with the banks is a cop-out. This was crony capitalism, a political problem. We&apos;ve had two prime ministers in the past 20 years who were on the take - Ahern and Haughey. Which is a lot, considering we&apos;ve only had five.&quot; There is another moment in recent Irish history worth recalling. It&apos;s 14 May 2001 and Bertie Ahern is throwing a party for 1,400 at Dublin castle, celebrating the rise of an Irish archbishop to cardinal. Ahern had sent out the invitations in his name and that of his then girlfriend, Celia Larkin. This romance was already a thorn in the new cardinal&apos;s side. Celia is a beautician and her parlour, Beauty at the Blue Door, stands all but opposite the cardinal&apos;s front door. Each morning, as the archbishop left his house, he would not only be reminded of the moral decay at the top of Irish society but also of the latest innovations in ladies&apos; grooming, including the Brazilian. Celia was swiftly exfoliated from the party&apos;s greeting line.  These days, the priest can relax. An increasing number of people are attending mass. Ahern stepped down when his finances proved too shaming, replaced by Brian Cowen, the former finance minister, who, while unloved, is seen to be honest. Meanwhile, Sean Dunne stands in a small conference room in the Berkeley Court Hotel, Dublin, working out how to cover the interest payments on the ground below, his skyscraper dreams ruined by the planning authorities. Charlie Chawke sits in his pub, mildly regretting a few business deals but declaring the recession over, in the Goat at least, because of his win at Cheltenham. As I leave that evening, he is singing quietly to himself: &quot;Padydeplasterer, nobody does it fasterer.&quot; But the recession isn&apos;t over. High society may have adjusted, eschewing Dublin&apos;s Michelin-starred restaurants in favour of lower-key eateries such as the Town Bar &amp; Grill (the night I was there, Tony O&apos;Reilly, the great business prince of the years before the boom, walked in - an event the owner said was unprecedented). Beyond such glamour, the collapse of the property bubble has seen unemployment rise past 11 per cent, banks nationalised, the economy forecast to shrink by 8.3 per cent, negative equity engulf great swathes of the population, the nation&apos;s international credit rating downgraded, economists warn of national bankruptcy, and taxes rising by \u20ac4,000 for the average family. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, recently wrote, &quot;As far as responding to the recession goes, Ireland appears to be really, truly without options.&quot; I take a train out of Dublin to Adamstown, and step out into a weird semi-wilderness. The station is like the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, manned by a lone ticket collector almost mad with boredom. Outside, a single building stands in a churned-up field, the centrepiece of a new town once heralded as the model of Irish development. I follow the deserted road east, beside a plyboard fence announcing a yet to be built swimming pool - &quot;Come in, the water&apos;s great&quot; - until I come to two primary schools and a few apartments. It is playtime and all the children are clearly from elsewhere. Which, I confess, comes as a shock. Mena Baskarasubramanian is from the south of India. Until three years ago, she was living in England, but her husband&apos;s job in the IT department of a bank (&quot;I know,&quot; she cries. &quot;I know,&quot;) had been reassigned to Dublin. &quot;When we arrived I heard about Adamstown and so I came to look for a house,&quot; she tells me. &quot;It was 2006 and you wouldn&apos;t believe it, people were queueing all night.&quot; She secured a two-bed apartment for her family for \u20ac300,000. Now chairwoman of the local primary school, Mena explains that 95 per cent of the students are from non-Irish backgrounds, with 26 nationalities. With an open face and wonderful optimism, she talks of the connections she is making, the beginnings of a very Irish network of Croats and Kazaks, Brazilians and Somalis, and Indians, and, more importantly, her fears for it. &quot;Because of the recession, people are going back to their countries. The Polish workers are going. Doctors are moving to the Middle East. I don&apos;t want to lose this beautiful structure we have at the moment.&quot;  The value of Mena&apos;s flat has fallen by \u20ac50,000, and many of the cranes over Adamstown are no longer moving. &quot;Some of the units have been stopped. The retail spaces were supposed to be open last year.&quot; I ask if her small boy will take up hurling. &quot;Probably. My daughter is becoming Irish, she loves Irish dancing. The other day, two children arrived not speaking a word of English, but after four days they were singing Irish songs, thanks to our four language-support teachers.&quot; Again, the enthusiasm falters. &quot;Due to the cutbacks it&apos;s been reduced to two. We don&apos;t know what we&apos;ll do next year.&quot; The Celtic tiger is dying, and nobody knows what will be left. Mena&apos;s fears - about jobs, about negative equity, about the community drifting away - are every woman&apos;s fears in Ireland. Some people tell me that this time it won&apos;t be like the 1980s, that with the whole world in recession there is nowhere for the young to go.  So I email Michael Dermody. &quot;We made it to Perth without any problems,&quot; he writes in reply.  &quot;I am busy house- and job-hunting. It&apos;s a beautiful city and the weather is lovely. I haven&apos;t tried any surfing yet. I heard shark attacks are fairly common this time of year, so reckon I&apos;ll wait another few months.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/10/channel-four-journalists-sri-lanka", "sentences": ["&quot;This is complete rubbish,&quot; he told AP after arriving in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-10T11:31:39Z", "title": "Sri Lanka throws out three Channel 4 journalists", "tags": ["Sri Lanka", "World news", "Freedom of speech", "Channel 4", "Censorship", "Television industry", "South and Central Asia"], "article": "Sri Lanka deported three journalists from Channel 4 television today, a day after they were arrested for alleged false reporting on the civil war.

Nick Paton Walsh, the channel&apos;s Asia correspondent, denied giving a statement to police or admitting wrongdoing. &quot;This is complete rubbish,&quot; he told AP after arriving in Singapore. Walsh said he was detained with producer Bessie Du and cameraman Matt Jasper by police in the eastern town of Trincomalee and asked to give a statement, but he refused. Later, a man in plain clothes spoke to him and took down notes, saying they were for his future reference, he said. Walsh said he believed the arrests were connected to his recent report on the conditions of war refugees and alleged sexual abuse in camps for those who fled the northern war zone. ITN News, which produces Channel 4 News, said the report, broadcast on 5 May, contained the first independently filmed video from one of the displacement camps. It claimed dead bodies were left where they fell, there were shortages of food and water and instances of sexual abuse \u2013 all claims that the Sri Lankan government has denied. In recent weeks, the government and aid groups have been struggling to cope with more than 120,000 civilians who fled the warzone, overwhelming displacement camps. The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate state for minority Tamils, who have suffered decades of marginalisation at the hands of governments controlled by the Sinhalese majority. Sri Lankan troops have won a series of battles and appear to be on the verge of crushing the decades-old insurgency but media rights groups have said the government&apos;s success has been accompanied by a ruthless campaign against dissenting media. According to Amnesty International, at least 14 local journalists and Sri Lankans working for media organisations have been killed since the beginning of 2006. Others have been detained, tortured or have disappeared. Amnesty says 20 more have fled the country because of death threats."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/may/11/magazines-recession", "sentences": ["He did it in Portugal and Singapore, almost simultaneously."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-10T23:01:00Z", "title": "Is a recession ever a good time to publish a new title?", "tags": ["Magazines", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media downturn", "Media", "Felix Dennis"], "article": "Cathie Black, the &quot;first lady of American magazines&quot; and president of Hearst Magazines, did it last week. The conservative Bauer family did it in Britain in March, and since February the high-end Nicholas Coleridge at Cond\u00e9 Nast has done it twice. So has Playboy&apos;s Hugh Hefner. He did it in Portugal and Singapore, almost simultaneously. Launching a print magazine in the midst of the worst market conditions in memory \u2013 when advertising has fallen off a cliff, consumers are tightening their belts and many titles are on deathwatch \u2013 seems somewhat counter-intuitive. Not to mention expensive. So why have so many experienced publishers chosen to do it? This year alone, Bauer has closed Arena and Dennis Publishing has closed Maxim in Britain, BBC Worldwide folded BBC Good Homes and Cond\u00e9 Nast closed Germany Vanity Fair and its $100m US business glossy Portfolio. But many in the industry believe that a recession is the perfect time to launch. Felix Dennis, for one, applauds the risk takers. &quot;The murderous recession of 2008/09 and perhaps 2010, will come to be viewed for what it really was: one of the greatest financial opportunities in the history of our industry,&quot; he told the FIPP World Magazine Congress last week. Of course, not all recent launches were planned to tie in with the middle of a recession. When Hearst, which owns the National Magazine Company in the UK and publishes Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and Esquire, started thinking a year ago about its new Food Network Magazine, just launched in the US \u2013 a joint venture with the eponymous cable channel \u2013 the credit crunch had not degenerated into recession. &quot;We knew things were tough, but we didn&apos;t know it was going to be this difficult,&quot; says Black. &quot;But there&apos;s no question people are at home more, they are entertaining at home, they are cooking at home, they are probably watching television more and reading magazines.&quot; The Food Network Magazine has already snared 650,000 subscribers, half via the internet and others through TV advertising and direct mail. &quot;We thought that we would come out at 300,000 [guaranteed sales per issue] and now we are at 900,000,&quot; says Black. Issue one had 62 advertising pages \u2013 above the 50 pages per issue target. Cond\u00e9 Nast UK has previous experience when it comes to launching in recessions. Its biannual style title Love launched in February with 116 advertising pages and 366 pages in all, and its technology lifestyle magazine Wired UK hit the shelves last month, with 52 ad pages out of 184 pages. For the second issue, however, advertising pages dropped to 25 out of 154 \u2013 and could fall further over the traditionally advertising-light summer. The publisher won&apos;t divulge sales figures, but says that Love has sold a high percentage of its 68,000 print run and Wired&apos;s heavily promoted first issue was 50% above forecast in newsagents. Both titles will hope that they can repeat the success of British GQ, which Cond\u00e9 Nast launched in 1989, the eve of the last recession, with Michael Heseltine on the cover. Other publishers are getting in on the act. Despite BBC Worldwide&apos;s decision to shut BBC Good Homes after circulation dropped by one-fifth, IPC last week licensed interiors title Living Etc, to an Indian company; Cond\u00e9 Nast&apos;s Glamour magazine will launch in Bulgaria through a licence partnership, its 16th global edition. &quot;To launch a magazine now is not an entirely daft thing to do. It is a brave thing but we should embrace the brave,&quot; says Vanessa Clifford, head of press for Mindshare, the media buying and planning agency. Black advises companies not to get bogged down. &quot;We don&apos;t want to do two years of planning. I think the biggest mistake that new magazines make is that they spend too long. Outside the US, you are much faster doing everything.&quot; However, publishers need to get the &quot;right space at the front of Tesco and the budget to tell people it is there&quot;, Clifford argues. But if readers take them to heart, all these launches will only survive if advertisers do too. In tough times, she adds, even if advertisers don&apos;t cut back, they &quot;tend to navigate towards tried and tested brands&quot;. Even established magazines are not safe: Hearst closed CosmoGIRL! and its inexpensive weekly Quick and Simple last year, despite circulation of 300,000. But while closures spell bad news for those involved at the titles, they could also provide opportunities. &quot;There are too many magazines, too many duplicative magazines, too many magazines that launched in an exploding advertising market and are bereft of a consumer franchise,&quot; says Black. Which rather suggests there is also room for some new titles to bloom. If anyone is brave enough to launch them, of course."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/11/viewpoint-terra-firma-guernsey", "sentences": ["These firms don&apos;t have much physical infrastructure in London and their senior partners, knowing their years of earning big bucks are finite, may choose to endure the low-tax boredom of Singapore or Switzerland."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-11T22:38:33Z", "title": "Mr Hands takes profits - to Guernsey", "tags": ["Private equity", "Tax avoidance", "Tax and spending", "Business", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Farewell, Guy Hands. The founder of the Terra Firma private equity house has moved to Guernsey to escape the 50% tax rate for high earners in the UK. He won&apos;t be the only wealthy businessman to leave and, indeed, many of his peers in private equity left years ago. But there is something uniquely irritating about Hands&apos; departure. In part, it&apos;s the fact that Hands&apos;s dealings with the UK government have, by and large, been highly profitable for him. Two of his most lucrative purchases were ones where the government was the seller. Investments in Ministry of Defence homes and Angel Trains set him on the road to immense personal wealth. In part, it&apos;s the timing. Private firms are lobbying the government to fight proposals from Brussels to regulate their industry more tightly. Their cause is just: the European commission&apos;s plans seem to be a heavy-handed attempt by France and Germany to kick the City of London at its moment of maximum vulnerability. Hands&apos;s decision to move to Guernsey hardly helps to encourage sympathy in this battle; other private equity folk, one suspects, will groan. Mostly, though, it&apos;s the fact that private equity partners have enjoyed such privileged tax treatment. Carried interest \u2013 in effect, a bonus for good investment performance \u2013 is treated as a capital gain rather than income. This rate is 18%, and for many years was 10%. Given that advantage, a 50% rate of income tax ought not to be much to grumble about. The point is very simple: financiers enjoyed the fruits of the boom and being asked to pay more after the bust is reasonable. But, irritation aside, what should be the mature response? Terra Firma itself is staying in the UK, so should we really care that a few individuals are quitting the country? Unfortunately, the answer looks increasingly like &quot;yes.&quot; If Hands, a high-profile businessman running high-profile companies such as EMI, can&apos;t see the moral case for staying in the UK, it is unlikely that others further down the tree will do so. Consider the position of hedge funds. These firms don&apos;t have much physical infrastructure in London and their senior partners, knowing their years of earning big bucks are finite, may choose to endure the low-tax boredom of Singapore or Switzerland. Hedge funds are marginal players in the City, but not so small that they can be ignored: this is a genuine export industry for Britain. What&apos;s the solution? Well, we may have to accept that the 50p tax rate has touched a nerve, partly because incomes in the City have fallen, and is in grave danger of being counter-productive in terms of raising revenue. There seems to be a straight choice \u2013 either impose stricter tax demands on holders of British passports wherever they live, or rethink the 50p rate. The former looks attractive; the latter, sadly, is more practical. A win for Centrica We will know in about a decade whether Centrica&apos;s investment in nuclear power makes long-term financial sense, but it helps to score a little victory before the game has begun. Centrica yesterday secured a 6% discount on the price at which it is buying a slice of British Energy, the nuclear generator bought by French group EDF last year. In fact, the discount is slightly greater than that, since Centrica is paying only half in cash; the non-cash element is a share of a Belgian power producer that has been marked well above a fair market price. It&apos;s a smart piece of negotiation by Centrica. Taking a 20%, rather than 25%, stake is also sensible, given how worried some of its own shareholders are about the nuclear adventure. Now it merely has to find other deals to secure long-term sources of energy supply. That task looks rather harder. Not everybody in the energy industry is as happy as state-controlled EDF to offer discounts just because the oil price is lower than it was last summer. Drawing a Blank UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body overseeing taxpayers&apos; interests in banks, is apparently undecided about whether to vote for or against the re-election of Sir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. UKFI may be hoping that the City institutions will clearly signal their views so that it can fall in with the prevailing mood; that seems unlikely to happen, because opinion is genuinely divided. Alternatively, Blank could resign and spare UKFI the embarrassment of making a difficult decision; that is more likely. But one rather hopes Blank sticks to his guns, because UKFI really ought to be capable of forming a judgment and defending it. The clock is ticking; the Lloyds meeting can&apos;t wait forever. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/13/rugby-world-cup-2015", "sentences": ["&quot;To have a World Cup in Asia would be a great leap forward for world rugby,&quot; said the Japan Rugby Union president Nobby Mashimo, who revealed that one pool would be played in Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-13T19:56:51Z", "title": "England's World Cup bid launched with promise of 3m ticket sales", "tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2015", "Rugby union", "Sport", "Rugby World Cup"], "article": "Twickenham has pitched to stage the 2015 World Cup by insisting that it would sell three million tickets, hire major Premier League football grounds, including Old Trafford, the Emirates Stadium, Anfield and St James&apos; Park, and boost the national economy by more than \u00a32bn. The Rugby Football Union has secured the support of the government, which has agreed to partially underwrite the \u00a380m guarantee demanded by the tournament organisers. England was one of four countries making presentations to Rugby World Cup Ltd in Dublin. The others \u2013 Italy, South Africa and Japan \u2013 also tendered to stage the 2019 World Cup. The International Rugby Board will name both hosts at a meeting on 28 July. When England bid for the 2007 World Cup, it was outmanoeuvred by France, which garnered votes by making concessions to individual unions, but the process is now different as RWC looks to ensure that the emphasis is on the best rather than back-scratching and it has made a fundamental change in how the tournaments will be awarded. The tender evaluation process is now being driven by RWC executives rather than individual union representatives. RWC will make recommendations to the IRB council based on the evidence it accumulates, and while they may be rejected, it minimises the risk of a bidder being undermined by horse-trading and will also end the unwritten agreement that the tournament alternates between the hemispheres. Previously, the council heard the tenders. The RFU believes its bid would generate the biggest World Cup yet. It would use five grounds with capacities in excess of 60,000 \u2013 Wembley, Twickenham, the Millennium Stadium, Old Trafford and Arsenal&apos;s Emirates Stadium \u2013 backed up by Anfield, Elland Road, the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, St James&apos; Park and Southampton&apos;s St Mary&apos;s Stadium. Only two rugby grounds would be used, Leicester&apos;s Welford Road and Gloucester&apos;s Kingsholm, something that is not an issue with the Premiership clubs who fully support England&apos;s bid. Wales would stage six pool matches and two quarter-finals at the Millennium Stadium. Wembley would host one quarter-final with Twickenham used for both semi-finals and the final. The third-place play-off would be held at the Emirates Stadium with the RFU proposing that the tournament run from 4 September to 17 October. &quot;Our bid represents a low-risk, high -return option for the IRB at a time of \u00adeconomic uncertainty,&quot; said Francis Baron, the RFU&apos;s chief executive. &quot;In 2015 it will be 24 years since England last hosted a World Cup and we believe the time is right. The combined capacity of our chosen stadia is in the region of 700,000 seats. Our target is to sell three million seats, a 30% increase on France 2007.&quot; Unlike its previous World Cup bid, the RFU went armed with former players to help make its presentation, the 2003 World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio and Will Greenwood. &quot;This tournament would exceed the players&apos; wildest dreams,&quot; said Dallaglio. &quot;It would be about playing in truly iconic stadia, in front of full crowds of passionate supporters, drawn from one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world.&quot; South Africa, the 1995 host, did not play the weather card but pledged a tournament at least as cash-soaked as England&apos;s. &quot;We offer the most dramatic stage to showcase the game of rugby; we can produce a commercially lucrative tournament, and we have a hosting environment and a readiness to deliver that is arguably second to none,&quot; said Mark Alexander, the South African Rugby Union&apos;s deputy president. Like South Africa, Italy and Japan have received government pledges that the \u00a380m guarantee would be underwritten. &quot;To have a World Cup in Asia would be a great leap forward for world rugby,&quot; said the Japan Rugby Union president Nobby Mashimo, who revealed that one pool would be played in Hong Kong and Singapore. &quot;Our message to the IRB council members is that 60% of the world&apos;s population lives in Asia and with 26 unions it could fire rugby. It could lead to a new stage, new possibilities and a new power.&quot;Italy has secured government backing not only financially but also in ensuring that rugby took preference over football during the course of the tournament, with leading Serie A stadia hosting matches and the final earmarked for Rome&apos;s Olympic Stadium, where the Champions League final will be held later this month."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/14/bruce-schneier-bioterrorism", "sentences": ["GR Dalziel, at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, has written a report chronicling every confirmed case of malicious food contamination in the world since 1950: 365 cases in all, plus 126 additional unconfirmed cases."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-13T23:05:00Z", "title": "Read me first: We shouldn't poison our minds with fear of bioterrorism, says Bruce Schneier", "tags": ["Technology", "Swine flu", "World news", "Flu", "Life and style"], "article": "Terrorists attacking our food supply is a nightmare scenario that has been given new life during the recent swine flu outbreak. Although it seems easy to do, understanding why it hasn&apos;t happened is important. GR Dalziel, at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, has written a report chronicling every confirmed case of malicious food contamination in the world since 1950: 365 cases in all, plus 126 additional unconfirmed cases. What he found demonstrates the reality of terrorist food attacks. It turns out 72% of the food poisonings occurred at the end of the food supply chain \u2013 at home \u2013 typically by a friend, relative, neighbour, or co-worker trying to kill or injure a specific person. A characteristic example is Heather Mook of York, who in 2007 tried to kill her husband by putting rat poison in his spaghetti. Most of these cases resulted in fewer than five casualties \u2013 Mook only injured her husband in this incident \u2013 although 16% resulted in five or more. Of the 19 cases that claimed 10 or more lives, four involved serial killers operating over several years. Another 23% of cases occurred at the retail or food service level. A 1998 incident in Japan, where someone put arsenic in a curry sold at a summer festival, killing four and hospitalising 63, is a typical example. Only 11% of these incidents resulted in 100 or more casualties, while 44% resulted in none. There are very few incidents of people contaminating the actual food supply. People deliberately contaminated a water supply seven times, resulting in three deaths. There is only one example of someone deliberately contaminating a crop before harvest \u2013 in Australia in 2006 \u2013 and the crops were recalled before they could be sold. And in the three cases of someone deliberately contaminating food during packaging and distribution, including a 2005 case in the UK where glass and needles were baked into loaves of bread, no one died or was injured. This isn&apos;t the stuff of bioterrorism. The closest example occurred in 1984 in the US, where members of a religious group known as the Rajneeshees contaminated several restaurant salad bars with salmonella enterica typhimurium, sickening 751, hospitalising 45, but killing no one. In fact, no one knew this was malicious until a year later, when one of the perpetrators admitted it. Almost all of the food contaminations used conventional poisons such as cyanide, drain cleaner, mercury, or weed killer. There were nine incidents of biological agents, including salmon\u00adella, ricin, and faecal matter, and eight cases of radiological matter. The 2006 London poisoning of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko with polonium-210 in his tea is an example of the latter. And that assassination illustrates the real risk of malicious food poisonings. What is discussed in terrorist training manuals, and what the CIA is worried about, is the use of contaminated food in targeted assassinations. The quantities involved for mass poisonings are too great, the nature of the food supply too vast and the details of any plot too complicated and unpredictable to be a real threat. That becomes crystal clear as you read the details of the different incidents: it&apos;s hard to kill one person, and very hard to kill dozens. Hundreds, thousands: it&apos;s just not going to happen any time soon. The fear of bioterror is much greater, and the panic from any bioterror scare will injure more people, than bioterrorism itself. Far more dangerous are accidental contaminations due to negligent industry practices, such as the 2006 spinach E\u00a0coli and, more recently, peanut salmonella contaminations in the US, the 2008 milk contaminations in China, and the BSE-infected beef from earlier this decade. And the systems we have in place to deal with these accidental contaminations also work to mitigate any intentional ones. In 2004, the then US secretary of health and human services, Tommy Thompson, said on Fox News: &quot;I cannot understand why terrorists have not attacked our food supply. Because it is so easy to do.&quot; Guess what? It&apos;s not at all easy to do.

Haseltine, a globally recognized environmental artist, has been outspoken for years on the issue of restoring the population of Crassostrea Virginica, New York&apos;s native oysters. In late April, she unveiled a collaborative piece of public art that she created with students in her &quot;Oyster Gardens&quot; class at The New School in New York City. The New School Midden (pictured at right) is a swirling array of glinting oyster shells, arranged to look like the movement of tidal waters. Haseltine likens it to the work of Andy Goldsworthy, whose work combining man-made objects with natural landscapes has become iconic. An avid activist and environmentalist, Haseltine has crafted large sculptural works depicting marvels of chemistry and microbiology, from an enormous rendering of the birth of a protein to a bronze sculpture of the SARS Protease Inhibitor which stands in front of the Singapore lab where the inhibitor was discovered. These works are glimpses into what science looks like, but lately Haseltine&apos;s work has actually begun to blend with science experiments, leaving its own unique imprint on science and the natural landscape, and in some cases even attempting to improve on nature&apos;s work. In June 2007 she unveiled a solar powered coral reef, in New York City&apos;s McNeil Park, and she is now working to see how the reef can interact with oysters and other marine life. Another project under construction actually mimics the gills of an oyster, filtering toxins from the water. I spoke with Haseltine recently on the phone as she painted in her New York studio: Julia Levitt: In your Oyster Garden class in the New School&apos;s Environmental Studies program, you explore art and design in connection with the environment. Can you explain what that means? Mara G. Haseltine: My oyster class is a window into my work. My work is a real combination of science and art. So when I work with marine biologists, I actually become part of their experiments. JL: How do you do that? MGH: I&apos;m part of the Global Coral Reef Alliance, and I studied innovative reef design in Indonesia. The solar-powered reef, which we&apos;re expanding this summer, is half artwork -- the structures are artwork, because I&apos;m a figurative sculptor, and then I work with marine biologists to do things like test to see if the electricity from the solar powered amp we used increased shell thickness. We&apos;re dealing with living organisms and we&apos;re creating habitat, which is really important for a myriad of reasons. Unlike mussels and clams, oysters create reefs, so they can prevent land erosion. [Reviving New York&apos;s oyster population] would just create a much healthier habitat for the more than 200 species that live on reefs. Oysters clean the water, they sequester toxins, so there&apos;s a lot of reasons why bringing back the oyster, which is sort of the backbone of the benthic habitat, is important. JL: Is that the main reason that you chose the oyster as your subject? MGH: Yes. And also, my family was in the pearl business, so I feel like I have an affiliation with oysters. And New York was once the oyster capitol of the world, boasting 350 square miles of oyster reefs. As an artist and an environmentalist, I like the concept of looking into the past to see into the future. JL: Do you find that you ever have trouble with people from the science world taking your work seriously? MGH: I try to partner with scientists. I never say I&apos;m a scientist. But I&apos;m starting to set up experiments and actually publish some science papers, so I think that&apos;s going to change. JL: What kind of experiments are you working on? MGH: I set up an experiment, which a graduate student actually ran, to test using mineral accretion technology in semi-controlled conditions. We wanted to find out whether oysters that were getting low volts of electricity and living on mineral accretion could grow thicker shells and have better health. We found that corals, when they&apos;re getting this boost of electricity, seemed to survive pollution and disease a lot better, so we&apos;re trying to figure out if that is true with oysters, too. JL: When you do partner with scientists, what does your perspective as an artist add to the collaboration? MGH: I work with them. For example, I&apos;m putting all these structures in the water this summer based on my new design, which is based on the structure of an oyster gill. The aim is to create the optimal shape and design, using biomimicry, for oysters to grow on. [Our design provides them with] the maximum amount of flow-through for water; they have all sorts of nooks and crannies for habitat. The helix shapes on the solar powered oyster reef allow for a lot of water flow around the oyster, which is actually kind of an improvement on nature&apos;s midden, because some of the oysters on the bottom actually die of starvation because the ones on top block them out and they can&apos;t get enough nutrients. JL: The shell midden that you recently designed with your Oyster Garden students used discarded oyster shells laid out in a design to mimic the appearance of water flow. Can you describe how that was built? MGH: It was very, very low tech. We got one day&apos;s worth of oyster shells from the oyster bar at Grand Central Station, where they go through about 5,000 oysters a day. We cleaned them, and then we just laid them on the ground in a certain pattern, working with the landscape that was already there. It just took a lot of elbow grease and forethought. JL: Man-made middens, where people have discarded objects in piles, are used by archaeologists to study records of human consumption. Was this part of your intent in the project? MGH: That was one thing that I thought was great about our midden. It was a record of consumption of one day in a modern world of oysters at Grand Central.&quot;Waltz of the Polypeptides&quot; by Mara G. Haseltine waltzPl_300.jpgJL: What other projects around the world have inspired you recently by combining art and environmental science? MGH: I think one really interesting project is The Eden Project in Cornwall, England. It&apos;s made of what look like Bucky domes, but designed a little differently, it&apos;s in a crater, and they have all these biospheres in them, and it&apos;s pretty cool. And I love Turrell&apos;s [work on the] Roden Crater in which he took a crater and made it almost like an Egyptian tomb, with all these different portals where you can look through them and it&apos;s in the middle of the desert, and see different star alignments and other things. I think all sorts of things like Chichen Itza, the pyramids, are marvelous. Wolf Hilbertz, who passed away about a year ago, all his work was mineral accretion, and I loved it so much I went to Indonesia and studied with him. I still work with his partner a lot, who&apos;s the director of the Global Coral Reef Alliance. JL: What do you think is the future frontier of art and environmentalism, if we really have just a few decades to make a big change in human impact on the planet? MGH: I think the stuff that I do actually could make a difference, because it&apos;s designing within scientific guidelines and permitting guidelines. But I think really that lobbying is most important, when the next Kyoto protocol will be negotiated in 2009, and there&apos;s giant chunks of floating plastic in the oceans which need to be cleaned up. I think that plastic bags should be abolished. I think that law of the sea needs to be put in order. I think that art in general is really great and can cheer people up, and art is great for awareness. But the real solutions, I don&apos;t think are necessarily completely art-based. What I&apos;m doing now is my own personal journey. \u2022 This article was shared by our content partner WorldChanging, part of the Guardian Environment Network"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/may/15/maradona-pele-platini-rivaldo-suker-falcao", "sentences": ["Platini, self-styled supporter of the small nations, said \u2013 and you&apos;ll like this \u2013 &quot;this goal was stupidly disallowed by some little linesman from Singapore who signalled an offside position of one of my team-mates who had nothing to with the action and was busy retying his laces.&quot; Platini would go on to score the decisive penalty in the shoot-out, but even winning such an important trophy could not fully assuage his regret."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-15T12:37:41Z", "title": "Football: Joy of Six: Rob Smyth on goals that never were", "tags": ["Football", "Diego Maradona", "Sport"], "article": "1. Pele, BRAZIL 3-1 Uruguay, World Cup quarter-final, 17/06/1970 The missionary position. Nowadays it is assumed once a month under something resembling duress, but once upon a time it was the most exciting thing that has happened to anyone, ever. So were sliced bread, the wheel and the strap on. But innovation and invention evaporate almost the moment they occur. That should be considered when we try to contextualise Pele&apos;s famous near misses in the World Cup of 1970: the one from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia and this dummy of the Uruguayan goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz in the semi-final. It seems relatively commonplace by modern standards \u2013 he dummies the keeper; big whoop-whoop \u2013 but at the time it was a staggering feat of audacity and imagination, as unexpected as guitars in dance music or a non-linear film. And no matter how many times Pele makes a tool of himself by advertising Viagra or eulogising Nicky Butt, we should never lose sight of that. 2. Diego Maradona, England 3-1 ARGENTINA, international friendly, 13/05/1980 El Diego&apos;s performance against England in 1986 inspired all manner of emotions in this country: xenophobia, nationalism, prejudice, hate. But it might also have engendered a sense of deja vu given this strikingly similar effort, which came in 1980 when Maradona was just 19. There have been other great near misses at Wembley \u2013 a young Gheorghe Hagi and Matt Le Tissier on his first England start (what difference might this have to his career?) spring to mind \u2013 but none as stunningly accomplished. There are, inevitably, certain differences between this and his goal in Mexico, and in a sense this is even better because he skips through the England defence in one mesmerising manoueuvre rather than lining them up one at a time. But in both he shows that priceless ability to slither &quot;like a lizard between rocks&quot;, to borrow Rob Hughes&apos;s marvellous description of Romario. Interestingly, Maradona said that the manner of his miss at Wembley, when he slipped it just wide of the far post, informed his decision to go round Peter Shilton in Mexico, which hints at a frightening ability for total recall in the heat of battle. And, as even the most fervent Englishman would eventually come to admit, a frightening ability full stop. 3. Roberto Falcao, BRAZIL 3-1 Argentina, World Cup Group C, 02/07/1982  Brazil&apos;s World Cup campaign of 1982 was one big Goal of the Millennium competition, a truly unprecedented portfolio of excellence. Yet like a lothario who ruefully reflects on the time he had that accident in the taxi home, the best of all might be the one that got away. It comes after 5.10 of this video and, like everything they did, it was devastating in its simplicity. From the moment Junior swept the ball infield from the left touchline, the ball was touched only three times, and did not hit the floor until after Roberto Falcao had rattled a left-foot volley off the top of the bar. The best bit of all, however, was the headed one-two with Socrates that preceded the shot. It was apt that they indulged in an impromptu game of head tennis; throughout the tournament, Brazil were playing a different sport to everyone else. 4. Michel Platini, Argentinos Juniors 2-2 JUVENTUS (2-4 pens), Intercontinental Cup, 08/12/1985 The Intercontinenal Cup (or Club World Cup) is sadly a bit of an afterthought in this country \u2013 who needs to be world champions when you&apos;re champions of England, eh \u2013 but anyone doubting its importance abroad need only look at Michel Platini&apos;s reaction in 1985 when, with the score 1-1, his outstanding goal was disallowed. Part of Platini&apos;s frustration was influenced by the fact that, like most great players, he had an ego the size of a small footballing nation. With a wonderfully dexterous three-touch manoeuvre, he had scored what he would later describe as the best goal of his career, which is no mean feat given the competition. Platini, self-styled supporter of the small nations, said \u2013 and you&apos;ll like this \u2013 &quot;this goal was stupidly disallowed by some little linesman from Singapore who signalled an offside position of one of my team-mates who had nothing to with the action and was busy retying his laces.&quot; Platini would go on to score the decisive penalty in the shoot-out, but even winning such an important trophy could not fully assuage his regret. 5. Davor Suker, CROATIA 3-0 Denmark, European Championship Group D, 16/06/1996 In the summer of 1996, before David Beckham introduced the concept to dinner parties the world over, the attempt to score from the halfway line still had enormous mystique. It was football&apos;s Everest; even Pele couldn&apos;t do it. During Euro 96, Davor Suker almost managed it with a moment that was the epicentre of a gloriously impish second-half performance against the reigning champions Denmark. Suker was relatively unknown at this stage, but his was an attempt so dripping in charm that even Peter Schmeichel \u2013 the mother of all on-field grouches, whose nose was even redder than usual after he had conceded a dodgy penalty \u2013 gave it the thumbs up. 6. Rivaldo, BARCELONA 3-2 Deportivo la Coruna, La Liga, 16/02/2002 It&apos;s a goal, a glorious and unforgettable goal that we&apos;ve eulogised so many times before that we can&apos;t be bothered to do so again, but it&apos;s not his goal.

At one level, the word suggests an outdated preoccupation with fixed social hierarchies. In Jane Austen&apos;s Mansfield Park, Mrs Norris bemoans &quot;the nonsense and folly of people&apos;s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above themselves&quot;. Yet &quot;rank&quot; also possesses some rather different and very current meanings. Most armies are still organised in ranks, and soldiers&apos; uniforms usually display insignia of their respective positions in the chain of command. When Olympic runners and swimmers race against each other, they are ranked according to the result, and the top competitors mount different-sized blocks in order to receive their gold, silver or bronze medals. And, every day, newspapers and magazines across the world print lists and charts ranking restaurants, hotels, films, schools, beauty contestants or bestselling books according to their perceived level of success and desirability. Now, as in the past, rank is closely associated with modes of representation and display: with making an ordered arrangement of people or things visible and evident to onlookers in some fashion. Hence the thinking behind the remarkable exhibition Rank: Picturing the Social Order 1516-2009, curated by Alistair Robinson and drawing on writings by academics, social theorists, politicians and journalists. Monarchs, aristocrats and other powerful and wealthy individuals have usually been happy to have themselves and their possessions and families immortalised in oil paintings and sculpture. But before the 20th century, such dynasts rarely commissioned artworks that set out to represent society as a whole. So, in order to illustrate their theme over time, the organisers of Rank have been obliged to draw substantially on less expensive and more specialised images, especially on prints and book illustrations. There is the engraving of the &quot;great chain of being&quot; from the Rhetorica Christiana of 1579, showing an enormous chain running from the beasts of the field at the bottom, up through the peasantry, and on by way of nobles and the monarch to the angels, and so to God at the very apex; and there is the frontispiece to Thomas Hobbes&apos;s Leviathan (1651), which Quentin Skinner has recently suggested may have been designed by Hobbes himself. One reason why print-makers and engravers were often interested in depicting the social hierarchy, it is suggested, is because - as artists who were also craftsmen - they were obliged to occupy an ambiguous position within it. Certainly, many of the printed images exhibited in Rank are remarkably thoughtful and intricate, and require very careful deciphering. The point of Leviathan, for instance, is not simply that multitudes of tiny, respectful men and women make up his body, whereas he supplies their crowned and powerful head. No less important is that he is represented with the symbols of both civil and ecclesiastical authority, and as presiding over a prosperous and protected city in a fertile landscape. By contrast, the lower half of the frontispiece contains images of other systems of rule (such as the military) that are linked with far less harmonious human landscapes, thereby driving home Hobbes&apos;s lesson that only those &quot;Commonwealths have been long-lived ... [which] never did dispute of the Sovereign Power&quot;. Almost by definition, even some of the more formal representations of power and society in this exhibition are also crowded with detail and nuance. William Powell Frith&apos;s painting Derby Day (1856-58) displays a frantic medley of men, women, children and babies, all brought together by the same sporting event, yet visibly divided in terms of dress, comportment, occupation, income, ethnicity, leisure and comfort. So it takes time in this busy panorama to notice the tumbler&apos;s far too puny boy apprentice, distracted from entertaining the crowd by the sight of a large pork pie and a boiled lobster. Or to see that, out of the elegant patrician group whom Frith portrays waiting to partake of this picnic, only a single woman has taken note of this wistful and starving child-worker.  At times, indeed, it is what is left out of these representations that is most striking. While all sorts of human beings in terms of rank and work are depicted in the &quot;great chain of being&quot;, none of them is shown as being female. By contrast, George Bernard O&apos;Neill is careful to include young girls, a mother, a widow and an elderly matron in his Public Opinion of 1867, a study of an animated group intent on a newly hung painting in an art gallery. But, on the evidence of their dress and the expensive catalogues they are clutching, none of these women or their male companions is from the labouring poor. The working class is excluded from this representation of the cultivated &quot;public&quot;, just as its members were substantially excluded from the Second Reform Act passed by parliament in the same year as O&apos;Neill&apos;s canvas was completed. In her introduction to the catalogue, Polly Toynbee identifies another kind of omission: &quot;an unacknowledged conspiracy&quot; since the 1970s on the part of both Labour and the Conservatives &quot;to pretend [that] the mighty inherited social differences of previous ages are dead and gone&quot;. She might equally well have remarked how, in recent decades and with the retreat of Marxian analysis, academics too have become notably less interested in economic and social divisions than in race, gender, culture and the makers of influential ideas. But all this may be beginning, ever so slightly, to change. The current outcry about &quot;fat cats&quot;, recent reports from ginger groups such as the Runnymede Trust and this exhibition itself may all be indicators that social class and its discontents are coming back on the agenda. Rank illustrates (quite literally) why social and other divisions remain important in Britain, while also exhibiting how complicated the map of class and inequality has been. Many of its exhibits have to do with the continuing, emphatic prominence of traditional sites of status and privilege. A 2003 pastiche by Eva Steinram reminds us how much wealth in the early 21st century is still commanded by the Crown Estate. A &quot;Football League&quot; of present-day British cities assembled by geographers at the University of Sheffield shows Oxford and Cambridge still securely entrenched in the top Champions League, with Liverpool relegated to bottom place on account of its low score in five measures of civic well-being. There are other conspicuous continuities. Social critics have long attacked London as the &quot;Great Wen&quot;. Just how utterly disproportionate the capital&apos;s wealth and pull remain is suggested here by Dexter Dalwood&apos;s clever adaptation of Gustave Dor\u00e9&apos;s print Over London by Rail. Dor\u00e9&apos;s squalid 18th- and 19th-century terrace houses, in the shadow of the Waterloo rail network, are still present in Dalwood&apos;s 2007 image. But they have been given modern estate agents&apos; noticeboards, so as to signal that houses in this part of London are now far beyond the pockets of most people in the UK. It is the gulf between much of southern England and the north that emerges most repeatedly from many of these images, often more dramatically than do the socioeconomic disparities between England, Wales and Scotland. It is indicative that Rank is an exhibition that has been generated in Sunderland, and that it is showing only in three northern cities (it opened at Leeds in February, has just moved to the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art in Sunderland, and shifts to Blackpool in July). One cannot quite imagine an art gallery in Rye, say, or Tunbridge Wells, or Cheltenham, clamouring for this one. Even in Victorian times, when the great northern and lowland Scottish industrial cities were at their height of prosperity, levels of individual wealth were still probably highest in the south-east. But as Alan Baker and others have shown, the split between north and south has been widening at a faster rate since the 1970s, not just because of de-industrialisation and the drain of money and talent southwards, but also because mass awareness of these things seems to have deepened. By the late 1990s, according to one estimate, per capita GDP was barely \u00a310,000 in the north-east. In London and the south-east, it was more than \u00a315,000. Some of the consequences of this are illustrated in one of the graphics on display in Rank. Originally published in the Financial Times last year, it represents the different regions and countries of the UK as if they were entirely separate economies, then calculates their resulting respective place in the world&apos;s pecking order. London emerged from this (pre-recession) conceit with a total GDP of \u00a3196bn, which put it at the same rank as Indonesia, then the world&apos;s 22nd biggest economy. Scotland&apos;s \u00a391bn GDP put it, when this graphic was first published, on a par with Venezuela. By contrast, the north-east&apos;s modest GDP of \u00a339bn meant that it came out on a par with Morocco.  Viewed one way, this image is an indictment of the extreme economic disparities that exist between different parts of the UK, and of how grossly London and the south-east overshadow the rest. At another level, it serves as an illustration of how absurdly prosperous this tiny polity as a whole was in 2008, with its constituent countries and regions (by some criteria) proving to be as rich as Indonesia, Austria, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore, Nigeria, Morocco, Thailand, Libya, Venezuela, Kazakhstan and the United Arab Emirates put together. This suggests why the catalogue of this exhibition is so worth reading and studying. Full of fascinating and often unfamiliar images, accompanied by sharp, intelligent commentary and (usually) accurate history, Rank offers powerful insights and provokes thought, while keeping clear of easy, one-directional analysis. It provides ammunition for those who believe that inequalities in the UK are getting very much worse. But it also offers some reinforcement to those who argue that trickle-down economics works, and that - despite all the evident unfairnesses - we have never, collectively, had it so good. And Rank confirms how slippy and capricious the criteria often are by which the human condition is judged. By the standards of some social investigators, virtually all of the best places to live in England are now situated south of Bristol. Yet a survey in 2008, featured in this exhibition, found that townsfolk in Scotland and the north of England were disproportionately likely to see themselves as &quot;happy&quot;. Some of this exhibition&apos;s few drawbacks may have been due to budgetary constraints. It would have been nice, for instance, to have had more examples of television and cinematic representations of Britain&apos;s social order. The complex impact on class of the unprecedented levels of non-white immigration into these islands since 1945 (a subject that is seemingly little treated in Rank) has arguably been examined more adventurously on the moving screen than in static art images. By the same token, The Full Monty (1997) might profitably have been used to illustrate the impact of growing female employment on masculine perceptions of the social and economic hierarchy. Released just after New Labour swept to power, but made in the dog days of John Major, this same film would also have supplied a wonderful illustration of the decline of trade unionism and collective action. The unemployed steel workers in The Full Monty (and, yet again, this is a saga of the de-industrialising north) do not rail against their former bosses, still less the capitalist system. They do not seek union aid. And only one (who is rather better dressed) seriously tries to educate himself for another job. Instead, a one-night stand at male stripping is presented as the thoroughly entrepreneurial and individualistic solution to these men&apos;s economic plight. It is a conservative and historically very revealing fairy tale. Yet perhaps what is most and unavoidably missing from Rank is the politics of it all. Both Conservative and Labour politicians in Britain are rather too fond of praising the relative &quot;classlessness&quot; of American society, and of urging their own people to emulate it. There is a certain falseness about such arguments, and also a certain hypocrisy. In reality, the US has its own type of class divisions, many of them rooted (as in Britain) in the educational system. But insofar as very many Americans believe that theirs is a country uniquely full of opportunity for all, the historical reasons for this need to be kept in mind. The United States was founded on a revolution that abolished the monarchy, aristocracy, titles and primogeniture. Britain may be able in the future to become a more equal and open society while retaining all of these things. But this has yet to be proved."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/17/horseracing-longchamp-takeover-target-goldikova", "sentences": ["The racing to get excited about, though, is at Longchamp and Kranji in Singapore where a whole host of top-flight runners are lined up with such as Takeover Target, Presvis, Goldikova and Coastal Path among the runners.", "1pm Rocket Man brought down to earth by Sacred Kingdom Phew - now that was a horserace as crack Hong Kong sprinter Sacred Kingdom bounces back to form and defies the previously unbeaten red-hot favourite Rocket Man in a ding-dong battle up the straight for the International Sprint title at Kranji in Singapore.", "Back to Singapore and Brett Prebble on Sacred Kingdom would surely have been straight into the stewards&apos; room if he had ridden a horse like that in Britain such was his (over)use of the whip in the closing stages.", "1.55pm Presvis desperately unlucky in Singapore International Poor Presvis.", "The British challenger has been denied by a head by French runner Gloria De Campeao in the Singapore International from his coffin box draw in 12 of 12."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-17T10:16:12Z", "title": "Horse racing: today's best bets plus the latest news on a big day for international racing", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "Today&apos;s best bets, by Tony Paley There&apos;s very little to get excited about on the domestic front today, as is usual on a Sunday in this country.

Godolphin challenger Diabolical finishes a distant third by sprint-race standards anyway while Takeover Target, who is scheduled to return to Royal Ascot in June for the Golden Jubilee Stakes, found very little despite being well positioned on the home bend and came home among the also-rans.

This was a below-par run.&quot; The Australian gelding was 8-1 third favourite for the Golden Jubilee prior to that run but there will be a shake-up of the betting after that.had eThe Ascot heat looks a race with some shape as Overdose, the ante-post favourite is currently sidelined with an injury.

The British challenger has been denied by a head by French runner Gloria De Campeao in the Singapore International from his coffin box draw in 12 of 12. Ryan Moore dropped the favourite out early from his very wide draw and Presvis was forced to race from the back. He was last until just before the home turn and after finding no room on the inside in the home straight, Moore was forced to switch to make his challenge. Presvis made up many lengths in the final furlong and only failed by a head to catch the leader. The runner-up was clearly the best horse in the race and it&apos;s such a shame that this former handicapper, who is now one of the highest-rated horses in the world, won&apos;t be racing in Britain this season but campaigned for top international prizes despite being trained in Newmarket. The winner was last seen in the Dubai World Cup when he was second, no less than 14 lengths behind runaway winner Well Armed. 2.35pm Coastal Path plum last at Longchamp The racing manager to Coastal Path&apos;s owner Khalid Abdullah did warn that the Ascot Gold Cup hope wouldn&apos;t want it too soft and the ground may have been the reason for the favourite&apos;s abject performance as he trailed in last in the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier at Longchamp. The race was won by Coastal Path&apos;s stablemate Americain at 14-1 who held off Pointilliste in a close battle for the Group Two prize. Coastal Path was clear third favourite at around 8-1 for the Gold Cup before today&apos;s event. Victor Chandler responded by pushing him out to 12-1. They bet: 5-2 Patkai, 7-2 Yeats, 10-1 Eastern Anthem, 12-1 Coastal Path, Geordieland and 14-1 Pointilliste, Schiaparelli and Watar. 3.35pm Rouget records a Group One double Stacelita looked a filly going places as she kept her four-race unbeaten record with a convincing win in the Group One Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp. She heads for the French Oaks next month and if the ground rides similarly soft she is going to have obvious claims.

China, the country that has based its development strategy on becoming the low-cost workshop for the world, was feeling the impact of an implosion in global trade caused by the financial crisis. Across Asia, empty container ships lay idly at anchor as consumer demand collapsed and stocks of manufactured products were run down. China had always expected \u2013 indeed, had planned \u2013 a slowdown in its economy once the 2008 Beijing Olympics finished, but it was not ready for the global collapse that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last September. Suggestions that China might be able to decouple itself from the problems that originated in the US housing market proved fanciful. Having caught the flood tide of globalisation for a decade and a half, the world&apos;s most populous country was inevitably affected as the tide went out. Yet everything is relative. Beijing expects China&apos;s economy to expand by 8% this year \u2013 down on the explosive double-digit pace since the turn of the millennium, but a growth rate to die for if you are Gordon Brown, Barack Obama or Angela Merkel. Already there are signs that the government&apos;s fiscal boost \u2013 worth 16% of gross domestic product over two years \u2013 is having an impact. A country that for three decades has been a curious mix of Karl Marx and Adam Smith has now turned to John Maynard Keynes to speed its way out of the global downturn. &quot;Because of China&apos;s structure, the government has direct levers to spend money quickly,&quot; said Prof Peter Williamson, of the Judge Institute of Management in Cambridge. &quot;Whereas in Britain it can take years to get an infrastructure project going, in China things can happen immediately.&quot; Much of the stimulus package is planned investment that has been fast-tracked rather than new money, but Gerard Lyons, the chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, says it will make a difference. &quot;The reality is that Beijing has announced a lot of new measures and they have started to push these measures through. They have pulled out all the stops.&quot; Political structure The real issue for China, however, is not whether the state can push the growth rate back above 10% next year; the consensus among economists is that it certainly can. Periods of rapid growth are by no means exceptional in Asia: Taiwan grew at 9.4% a year for more than a quarter of a century after 1962; Singapore expanded at much the same pace between 1967 and 1993; Japan&apos;s purple patch was the period between 1960 and 1973, when its average growth rate was 10%-plus. But China faces three sets of challenges that will shape the way it \u2013 and the global economy \u2013 evolves over the next half century. At the root of everything lies the question of whether the country&apos;s political structure is conducive to sustained growth. In the west, the classic pattern of development has been for economic change to stimulate demands for political reform and greater democracy. Despite the arrival of designer labels to the glitzy shopping malls of Shanghai, China remains a one-party state and there is little evidence that the ruling Communist party has any intention of loosening its grip. Anxiety that rapidly rising unemployment, particularly among disaffected graduates, might put millions on the streets this summer demanding change, helps explain both the scale and the speed of China&apos;s economic stimulus. Memories of Tiananmen Square are still vivid for the policy elite in Beijing. But some economists believe the fear of political change will hold China back. Prof Andrew Tylecote, of Sheffield University, believes the top-down fiscal package exacerbated the fundamental weakness of the economy \u2013 its lack of a thriving private sector. &quot;You tell state-owned banks to lend more money and they will do so. You tell state-owned enterprises to take on more staff and borrow more money and they will do so. If you throw money at anything remotely shovel-ready in terms of infrastructure, you will have an impact. &quot;But what they are not doing is beefing up the private sector. The dynamism ought to be coming from the private sector, which has been hammered by the crisis yet is not being looked after by the stimulus or by the boosting of credit. The stimulus is going to produce a more top heavy, muscle-bound economy full of rather expensive, poorly-utilised equipment.&quot; China, though, is the country that pioneered paper, the compass, steel, the wheelbarrow, gunpowder, canals and a host of other innovations while western Europe was still struggling to emerge from the Dark Ages.  New challenges In more recent years, Chinese expats have taken their entrepreneurial skills around the world, and in the domestic market Chinese companies are about to overhaul western multinationals in patent filing for the first time. &quot;There is a lot of innovation,&quot; says Williamson. &quot;The really interesting companies are hybrids, which are 30% state owned and which get the best of both worlds \u2013 autonomy but support from the state. The idea that there is a Soviet Russia-style state sector is completely incorrect.&quot; Every bit of that innovation will be needed as China grapples with its next set of challenges, all of which \u2013 according to Lyons \u2013 relate to significant imbalances. These are the gap between living standards in the cities and in the countryside; the comparison between the wealth of the coastal strip and the poverty of the inland regions; the mismatch between the country&apos;s projected growth rate and its energy needs; the rudimentary social safety net which encourages the population to save rather than spend; and the way that lack of domestic consumption exacerbates tensions in the global economy between those countries that export too much and those that export too little. None of these challenges will be solved quickly or easily. China&apos;s energy needs are enormous, and it has started to channel part of its export earnings into sovereign wealth funds, which are now taking advantage of the global recession to buy up assets at knockdown prices. &quot;Cash-rich Chinese concerns are taking advantage of depressed asset prices and debt deleveraging in the resources sector to lock in future energy and resources needed for continued growth&quot;, said Jan Randolph, of IHS Global Insight. Recent coups have been &quot;loan-for-oil&quot; deals with Russia, Brazil and Kazakhstan; in Africa, China has helped build roads, railways and ports to secure access to the raw materials it needs to sustain its high growth rate. These needs are \u2013 and will remain \u2013 substantial. China is undergoing the most rapid urbanisation the world has ever seen and has 221 cities with a population of more than 1 million. To put that in perspective, Europe has 35. The gap in living standards between those living in the cities and the rural population is large and growing: China&apos;s development has been accompanied by a widening of income inequality. Welfare state costs Yet because it is unusual in experiencing the problems of both a developing and developed country \u2013 high growth and an ageing population \u2013 the government is worried about the cost of a western European-style welfare state. Rudimentary healthcare and the cost of a decent education means that families save far more heavily than in the west, leaving them with less money left over at the end of the month to spend in the shops. Unless that changes, the imbalances in the global economy that were at the root of the crisis will remain a threat. In the longer term, Beijing has to decide how to use China&apos;s growing economic clout on the global stage. China has allowed Americans to live beyond their means for years by using its export earnings to buy US Treasury bonds; the fear in Washington is that Beijing will pull the plug once it is ready to challenge US hegemony. According to Tylecote, China&apos;s geopolitical objectives are far more limited. &quot;Taiwan is clearly a massive issue and China does not want to be told it cannot reclaim the motherland because an American fleet is sitting in the Taiwan Strait. It wants to challenge US hegemony in its own sea lanes. But I don&apos;t think policy makers have a 30-40 year time horizon; they are much more focused on short-term issues.&quot; One of these issues \u2013 which runs through decision making in the short, medium and long term \u2013 is how to make China&apos;s growth environmentally sustainable. Jeffrey Sachs, the US economist, believes that by 2050 China and America will have economies of a similar size, yet if China operated at the same level of resource use and energy intensity as the US it would require four planets to support its 1.5 billion people. &quot;Pollution is a really serious issue,&quot; said Williamson. &quot;But it is only partially being addressed. The government is looking at nuclear power, solar power, and renewables in an attempt to improve efficiency but in some cities there is a dash for growth and the environment is low on the priority list.&quot; China&apos;s stance at December&apos;s climate change summit in Copenhagen is seen as crucial in piecing together a successor to the 1997 Kyoto agreement. Western diplomats say they detect a softening in Beijing&apos;s approach, but China will not be pushed around. Its growth rate means it will get the one thing its policymakers want more than anything else: respect."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/18/presvis-singapore-airlines-international-cup", "sentences": ["Moore was just a fast-diminishing head away from victory on Presvis in the Singapore \u00adAirlines \u00adInternational Cup at Kranji, \u00admissing out on a first prize of \u00a3820,000 thanks to a \u00admixture of bad luck in the draw and worse luck in the race itself."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-17T23:05:16Z", "title": "Ryan Moore not the merrier after Presvis gets no luck in running", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Ryan Moore"], "article": "Ryan Moore will be riding in the \u00adrelaxing, riverside surroundings of Windsor this evening but his mind may still be \u00adconsidering the one that got away in the south-east Asia yesterday lunchtime.

The success of Never On Sunday \u00adcompleted a Group One double for Rouget and his jockey Christophe Lemaire, \u00adfollowing the victory of Stacelita in the Prix Saint-Alary. Stacelita came away from her field with considerable ease in the straight, and is now likely to run in the Prix de Diane (the French Oaks). The big race of the weekend in the US was the 134th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico, Baltimore, the second leg of the Triple Crown, and while the defeat of Mine That Bird, the Kentucky Derby winner, means that there will be no Triple Crown winner this year, the historic success of Rachel Alexandra has provided the sport in the States with a major new star. Rachel Alexandra just held the late charge of Mine That Bird, who confirmed his 50-1 Derby success was no fluke by passing all bar the winner in the final half-mile. Rachel Alexandra is the first filly to win the Preakness for 85 years, and the first to do so as the favourite for more than a century. Steve Asmussen, who took over as Rachel Alexandra&apos;s trainer barely a week ago after she was sold to Jess \u00adJackson, best known as the co-owner of Curlin, has yet to \u00adcommit the filly to the Belmont Stakes in New York next month. &quot;She struggled with the ground and I think she has become used to the track at Churchill, where she just skips along,&quot; said Calvin Borel, the winning jockey. &quot;I spotted Mine That Bird but I felt like I had it won. She is the greatest horse I&apos;ve ever been on in my life.

What the Sri Lankan government h as &quot;wanted to see&quot;, he might say in the jargon of the new interventionism, is clean and transparent democracy in Britain. Speaking for all Sri Lankans, he would regard the affair of MPs&apos; expenses as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;not living up to their commitments&quot;. A group of Sri Lankan MPs would be visiting Britain to monitor developments. Ridiculous? Yet those are exactly the words and tone of voice used by Britain&apos;s foreign secretary, David Miliband, in his dealings with what seems like half the globe. The Foreign Office wakes each morning and scans the world&apos;s conflicts to ponder where it might score a quick headline with a call for peace, reform, a ceasefire or &quot;United Nations action&quot;. I cannot see the point of Britain telling the world that &quot;what we want to see is Russia on a different course&quot;. It merely infuriates every Russian. Why does Miliband say of Syria&apos;s dictator that &quot;I&apos;ve been talking for over 18 months to him about his responsibilities in the region&quot;, as if he were Lugard addressing a recalcitrant Nigerian chief? Why boast that he is &quot;working on maintaining a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza&quot; when he is doing nothing of the sort? A delegation of Singapore&apos;s MPs might feel equally justified in visiting London to express the &quot;unacceptability&quot; of Britain&apos;s financial regulation. The Colombian prime minister, recently criticised by Miliband for the &quot;impunity&quot; of his militia, might wonder at the impunity of Britain&apos;s corrupt arms dealers. Pakistan, lectured weekly by London about its army&apos;s performance, might demand an inquiry into discipline at Deep Cut barracks. Beijing might discover a Miliband-style &quot;moral obligation&quot; to defend minority rights in Northern Ireland, given the resurgence of separatist violence. The Swedes might denounce Britain&apos;s care of the elderly on the grounds that they &quot;cannot stand idly by&quot; while welfare state values are traduced by British callousness. Were any of these things to happen, British politicians and the British media would be outraged. How dare other nations pass judgment on our affairs? What business is it of theirs? Yet this is what Britain does to them. Foreign policy is in 19th-century mode, with a moral gunboat over every horizon. Iran, Colombia, Kenya, Russia, Sri Lanka have all been damned by Miliband with the same fatwa as &quot;unacceptable&quot;. Regular ceasefire calls are bread and butter to the Foreign Office&apos;s underemployed policymakers. These feel-good gestures of episcopal concern are intended to generate a warm sense of wellbeing in speaker and audience, a jerkily liberal response to &quot;something must be done&quot;. The effect is zero. This is not megaphone diplomacy but piccolo. Ceasefires usually benefit one side or the other in a running conflict. They are seldom impartial to those embroiled in the theatre of war, any more than are other weapons of soft intervention such as condemnation, boycott and commercial and financial sanction. In Sri Lanka a rudimentary study of the past three months of fighting would have told Miliband that a ceasefire would be pro-Tamil, not just &quot;pro-humanitarian&quot;. He compounded his demand by damning the &quot;indiscriminate&quot; shelling of Tamil civilians. How he could do this while supporting the bombing of Pashtun civilians along the Afghan border is a mystery. Yet the consequence of appearing to support the Tamils was to infuriate those same insurgents when Miliband refused to lift a finger to give force to his ceasefire call. It was just words, hypocritical window-dressing. It appeared to support a partitionist movement, but refused to do so in practice. The outcome has been entirely negative. Miliband is regarded in Colombo as an incompetent neo-imperial \u00admeddler whose embassy was attacked on \u00adMonday and whose effigy was burned and tossed into the compound. Meanwhile the Tamils, double-crossed by London&apos;s posturing, reacted with one of the most furious demonstrations seen in Parliament Square. The conflict was not ended by this rhetorical intervention. No lives were saved, no British interest served. Each side has merely been convinced that London was favouring its sworn enemy. Policy towards Sri Lanka merits a doctoral thesis in diplomatic ineptitude. Britain had no dog in this fight, and no capacity to influence events either way. Its platitudes, bromides and \u00adhectoring were merely patronising, like an NHS advert telling the world to wash its hands and blow its nose. As of today, Britons travelling to Sri Lanka must be less safe than any other foreign nationals, whichever side of the divide they happen to encounter. Such intervention soon falls victim to relativism. The one country that is treated by Miliband with kid gloves is the People&apos;s Republic of China. He recently told the Fabians that &quot;it is important that we don&apos;t treat China as an errant child&quot; \u2013 implying just such treatment for every other moral \u00admiscreant. Why? Because China is rich. Such intervention has been as pointless in Sri Lanka as its predecessors in Israel/Palestine, Russia, Georgia, Iran, Burma, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Tony Blair&apos;s 1999 exegesis on so-called liberal interventionism, whatever its justification in the Balkans, has degenerated into a global woe-crying under Gordon Brown and Miliband. Where the fine talk led to military action, at least it walked the walk. Labour&apos;s early decision to move from the Tories&apos; policy of humanitarian relief in Yugoslavia to threatened, then actual, aggression against the Serbs represented a coherent policy. By rewarding each separatist movement in turn it achieved Nato&apos;s covert objective of Balkan fragmentation. The same outcome will probably follow intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and even Pakistan. Such policies may be disagreeable but at least they are understandable. Miliband&apos;s piccolo diplomacy is a mystery. He seems to crave a role above his station, howling at the moon as if saying so made it so. He has summoned the ghost of Palmerston from a Whitehall attic, but confined him to the press office, to write endless speeches full of words such as unacceptable and disappointed. At this very moment someone in the Foreign Office must be drafting a memorandum for his boss, welcoming the agreement of both sides in Sri Lanka to Miliband&apos;s demand that they cease \u00adhostilities and behave like sensible chaps. How good of them to do so.

A gathering of smartly dressed, silver-haired people are raising their champagne glasses to toast the retirement of their company&apos;s longest-serving employee, who is leaving at the age of 83, after 60 years&apos; service. The youngsters, still in their 50s and 60s, know they have several decades ahead of them before they can afford to retire.  A dystopian fantasy? Not according to pensions experts, who warn that the UK faces a retirement crisis so huge it could make the credit crunch look like a blip. If we continue on our current course, Britain will simply not be able to afford to grow old: the only hope of averting wholesale misery in retirement, they say, is for us to accept we will have to work longer, consume less and save more. The idea that the experience of a generation of better-off pensioners can be replicated in future, with people taking retirement in their 50s and living a prosperous, leisured lifestyle is just not possible, the specialists say. Working longer, for those lucky enough to be able to stay in jobs, could be the best-case scenario: the alternative is for the yuppies of yesterday to turn into tomorrow&apos;s &quot;oddballs&quot; - old, depressed, broke and living longer. Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and former economic adviser to 10 Downing Street, puts it succinctly: the pensions crunch will be worse than the credit crunch because it will affect more people, but both the public and politicians are intent on sweeping aside this unpleasant reality. Altmann is not alone in issuing dire warnings about our collective failure to provide for the future: economists and actuaries are unanimous that the UK is no country for old men - and it is even worse for old women. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that levels of savings and wealth in Italy, France, Spain and Britain are too low to allow people to continue consuming at their current rate after retirement, and that the problem in the UK is &quot;particularly acute&quot;. Separate research from the Pensions Policy Institute found a wide gap between what pensioners have put aside, and the amount they need to replicate the lifestyle they had while at work. Even relatively high earners are unable to match their pre-retirement spending without taking measures such as releasing capital from their home. The figures are truly frightening: being old in the UK is for many people a hand-to-mouth existence. The National Pensioners Convention (NPC) reckons that the average private pension pot will give a single man of 65 an income of less than \u00a32,000 a year; a pension pot of \u00a3100,000 will, at current annuity rates, yield an annual sum of just about \u00a34,500. Yet having a private pension at all puts you in the fortunate category: nine million people are relying on the state, which pays a full basic pension of \u00a395.25 a week, or a \u00a357.05 reduced rate for those - mainly women - who have not paid enough national insurance contributions to qualify for the full amount. Hardly surprising then, the NPC contends, that 822 old people fall into poverty every day in Britain - within Europe, only in Latvia, Spain and Cyprus are you more likely to end up old and poor.  More than 2.5 million old people are below the poverty line and, of those, two thirds are women, who fare even worse than men because they earn less and are more likely to have career breaks. High divorce rates mean they cannot rely on a husband&apos;s pension to bail them out.  Research two years ago by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that the UK state pension system provides around 30% of average pre-retirement earnings, lower than in Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Denmark. Clive Fortes, a partner at actuary Hymans Robertson, says: &quot;You have people starting work later, because more go to university. They want to retire earlier and they are living longer. The maths does not add up.&quot; The pensions crisis was gathering force even before the credit crunch, but the financial meltdown has exacerbated the situation for individuals, for the state and for companies. &quot;It has damaged individual savings - whether that is a permanent hit or whether it can be recovered, I don&apos;t know,&quot; says Fortes. &quot;People are having to replenish their own funds at a time of job insecurity and tight household budgets.&quot; The crunch will also make it harder to fund the state pension. There is a mountain to climb because of the increased public borrowing needed to bail out the banks and prime the economy: state pensions, along with public sector pensions, require a continuation of economic growth and prosperity. As for company pensions, most are mired in deficit; for corporate Britain, that will be a huge drain for years to come, acting as a drag on the recovery and on share prices. What can be done? &quot;The only solution in my view is to work longer,&quot; says Fortes. &quot;There is a general acceptance that a 65-year-old man isn&apos;t old, so he shouldn&apos;t be retiring yet. Raising the retirement age to 70 would have a huge impact - a five-year delay can boost your retirement income by 30%.&quot; It wasn&apos;t always like this. The UK&apos;s company pensions, most of which were linked to an employee&apos;s salary on retirement, used to be the envy of the world. But a combination of longer life expectancies, poor stock market returns and a failure to build up funds during the good times has left companies in the FTSE 350 index nursing a combined pension fund deficit of \u00a3182bn, according to Fortes. The National Association of Pension Funds reckons that 1,000 private-sector final-salary schemes will close to new members over the next five years, and a quarter will also take the more drastic step of closing to existing members. The first big company to bar current pension fund members from accruing any more benefits could well be private-equity-owned pharmacy chain Alliance Boots, which has indicated it is considering shutting its scheme. That would be a bitter irony to John Ralfe, former head of corporate finance, who tried in 2001 to safeguard colleagues by moving the entire fund out of risky stock market investments and into bonds. He left a year later; soon after, the scheme went back into shares. Ralfe is one of the few who can claim not to be merely wise after the event. He says: &quot;There is no &apos;magic money tree&apos;, which allows small savings today, invested in shares, to grow to a large amount tomorrow - that idea was always fool&apos;s gold. Companies and shareholders have always underestimated the real costs and risks of pension funds. The prime minister has been bewitched by the City and this applies to pensions - his ministers and confidants also believed in the magic money tree.&quot; Traditional final salary schemes, the gold standard of retirement provision, were under assault before the credit crunch, but it could prove the last straw. Formerly paternalistic employers had been rushing to offload their schemes to pensions buyout merchants - private equity operators which have no relationship with the scheme members, and are in it solely to make a profit. This has happened at P&amp;O, Rank, Emap, Lonmin and even Friends Provident, itself a provider of pensions. Hundreds of thousands of former employees have seen their entitlements bundled up and passed on to buyers in a multibillion pound game of pass the parcel - without being given a say in the transaction, let alone a vote. The credit crunch has put an end to corporate pension sell-offs, for now, but there are other unappetising consequences. The downturn is leading to a big increase in corporate bankruptcies: accountant Punter Southall warns that \u00a31.6bn of pensions are at risk from the latest wave of insolvencies, and there is already a queue of schemes waiting to be rescued by the Pension Protection Fund, set up as a lifeboat for workers whose companies go bust, taking their pension funds with them. The policies being deployed to combat the crunch are also having a detrimental effect on pensions. Low interest rates are suppressing the returns on pension fund investments; and for complex technical reasons, the Bank of England&apos;s policy of quantitative easing - printing money - is wiping billions off funds, adding an estimated \u00a312bn overnight to the red ink on the FTSE 350. Down the line, funds are vulnerable if inflation takes off again as a result of printing money, because it increases their liabilities. &quot;The policies being used to fight the credit crunch are damaging today&apos;s pensioners, tomorrow&apos;s pensioners and pension funds themselves,&quot; says Altmann. &quot;If the government wants artificially to depress interest rates, which is what it is doing, it should look at providing special bonds for pensioners and pension funds to bypass that artificial reduction. But very little has been done to protect them.&quot; Like Ralfe, Altmann questions the widespread view in the City that pension funds&apos; best strategy is to invest heavily in shares. &quot;Our entire pension system is based on a giant bet on the stock market. The only reason we have been able to get away with paying such a low state pension here is because there was always the assumption that private pensions, invested in the stock market, would be generous enough to offset the state cuts. But look at Japan - in 20 years, the stock market is about a quarter of what it was. Look at the last 10 years in the UK, when the stock market has not performed.&quot; The government, in the eyes of most pensions experts, has not only failed to tackle the problem - despite warm words about encouraging retirement saving, it has made it worse. There have been some achievements during Labour&apos;s 13 years, for instance, the introduction of the protection fund and a pensions regulator. There has also been a series of reviews by Lord Myners, Ron Sandler and Lord Turner among others; the Turner recommendations will lead in 2012 to new Personal Accounts, designed for people on modest earnings. Critics point out, though, that one of Gordon Brown&apos;s first acts as chancellor was to abolish tax relief on dividends paid to pension funds, costing them around \u00a35bn a year and making today&apos;s deficits markedly worse. Brown has also come under fire for his handling of the Equitable Life scandal, which damaged confidence in private pension savings and regulation, and changes he ushered in back in 2006 to simplify pensions and tax are widely viewed as having failed. Measures in the most recent budget, to limit tax relief for higher earners, have attracted a huge amount of criticism. Some fear it will encourage the executives who make decisions about schemes to shut them down because they no longer stand to benefit personally. &quot;It&apos;s just human nature,&quot; says Clive Fortes. &quot;In some cases it has removed the last remaining incentive for managers to keep a scheme alive.&quot; Trevor Matthews, chief executive of Friends Provident, adds: &quot;The fact that the government is fiddling with pensions again is not good for us as an industry or as a country. Higher earners won&apos;t get much sympathy, but this is another nail in the coffin for pensions and saving. High earners will find another tax efficient way to save, but it will deter others lower down the scale and the overall image of pensions has taken another battering.&quot; Deborah Cooper, of consultants Mercers, agrees: &quot;They have made it so complex it is ludicrous - particularly in this budget. Something that should be a simple, good thing has been turned into a nightmare of complexity. On a psychological level, it seems to a lot of people that it is hardly worth saving because how can you get your head round it? And there is a lot of risk being put on to people&apos;s shoulders. Even the most financially literate make investment mistakes.&quot; Not every investment guru is pessimistic. Lothar Mentel, of Octopus Investments, says: &quot;Do I worry about my own pension at the age of 41? Not at all, it is great because I can get assets more cheaply at the moment. We are at the nadir of the credit crunch and from here it seems as if the long-term pension models don&apos;t function any more, but a year from now they might look as if they do work again.&quot; He advocates a radical solution to pension woes, arguing that young people should take out large loans and invest the money in the stock market to get the benefit of long-term investment returns. &quot;We take out a big mortgage to buy a home, so why not to fund a pension? If we took out a massive loan at 25 and paid it back in monthly sums, we would have longer to build our retirement funds. There would have to be a state regulatory framework so you couldn&apos;t completely balls it up as a private individual, though.&quot; It seems unlikely that credit-crunched Britons, struggling with credit card bills and negative equity, would embrace Mentel&apos;s solution. The first step towards averting the crisis, according to John Ralfe, is for individuals and politicians to face the facts. But, as he says, &quot;there are not many votes in saying work longer and spend less&quot;. Ros Altmann counsels a radical rethink of both work and retirement. She accepts that while many middle-class professionals may be keen on working beyond 60 or 65, manual labourers are less willing or able to do so. She insists, however, that we should still encourage older people to stay in the workplace, as the alternative would be grey armies of depressed and straitened over-50s, eking out a miserable existence. &quot;There is a new period of life - the bonus years - where you are still fit and well, you are gradually withdrawing from the workforce, but you are still economically active. I&apos;m talking about working flexibly, as mothers with young children do, but for old people. There should be no set age, like 65, when you are officially past it.&quot; The single father: &apos;I suspect things will be even worse 40 years from now&apos; Single father Adrian Horsley, who lives with his nine-year-old daughter Elizabeth in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, admits that he manages to save &quot;next to nothing at all&quot; for his retirement - and that worries him. How will he manage in 40 years&apos; time, he wonders. But Adrian has little choice. For him, financially, life is a struggle. At 31, he works part-time as a campaign administrator for Yorkshire Building Society&apos;s charitable foundation, earning \u00a38,500 a year. He receives around \u00a3400 a month in working and child tax credits from the government, but has no other income.  He pays 5% of his salary into his employer&apos;s pension scheme, a sum matched by the Yorkshire. &quot;Things are very difficult,&quot; he says. &quot;At the moment, I am breaking about even, with \u00a31,000 coming in a month and the same going out. I have started selling things on eBay to try to make a bit more money.&quot; He hopes to go back to full-time working once Elizabeth is old enough to get to school and back on her own, but even then his priority will be to put any extra money he has into savings for his daughter&apos;s future. &quot;It is worrying as my dad will soon be reliant on the state pension - and God knows how he&apos;ll manage on that,&quot; says Adrian. &quot;I wonder what will be available when I retire? I suspect things will be even worse than now, but I don&apos;t have a choice about what to do.&quot; Adrian has always been careful with his money. Having been a debt collector in a previous job, he has seen the trouble people can get themselves into. But his pension is not a priority when he has his daughter&apos;s future university fees and a deposit for her first home on his mind. &quot;I do read my pension statement every year, but retirement seems so far away,&quot; he says.Lisa Bachelor The struggling pensioner: &apos;We were told we would be cared for if we raised a family&apos; Rita Young, 73, is forced to rely solely on the state for her retirement income as raising a family and a &quot;meagre salary&quot; made it impossible for her to save. &quot;Anyway, when I was younger we were told that we would be well cared for in later life if we took time off work to be a housewife and raise a family,&quot; she says. &quot;So I never felt forced to make my own pension provision, and couldn&apos;t afford to anyway.&quot; Rita, a retired market researcher, now has an income of \u00a3153 a week, made up of \u00a3134 in state pension and \u00a318.70 in pension credit. &quot;I get a bit of extra state pension from my late husband&apos;s contributions,&quot; she says. &quot;But I opted for the reduced-rate &apos;married woman&apos;s stamp&apos; when I was raising my son, which we were told was a good thing - but it turned out that wasn&apos;t the truth.&quot;  Even when she was working, she says, her maximum salary was \u00a33,500 a year in 1978. &quot;I&apos;ve never had a good wage, or a particularly steady income,&quot; she says. Her biggest outgoing is \u00a379 a month on gas and electricity, and after that she is left with about \u00a320 to spend a week on food. &quot;All the other bills, including council tax, water and the percentage of rent I pay, at \u00a36.50 a month, take a huge lump out of my money and leave me with just pennies,&quot; says Rita. &quot;I know groups are campaigning to get the state pension raised, which is great, but I would also like not to have to be means-tested by this age - and for pensioners not to have to resort to budget food, which is full of sugar, salt and fat, just to survive.&quot; She has no savings, and feels strongly that the recent budget has not addressed the needs of people in her position. &quot;I want the state pension to rise to \u00a3165 a week, and even with the 2.5% rise the government has dished out in the budget this still keeps it below \u00a3100 a week for most people. Not enough is being done for pensioners on low incomes so that they can get out of the poverty trap.&quot; She adds: &quot;I put an extra jumper on to save money, but I can&apos;t understand why everything has to be so dear - the three main staples of life for me are gas, electricity and water and I struggle to afford them.&quot; Turning to the future for the younger generation, Rita says: &quot;Many of them are possibly going to be worse off than me, as now they can&apos;t even get work, and that gives them no chance of a retirement income. Who knows what&apos;s going to happen, but it doesn&apos;t look good.&quot;Harriet Meyer The divorcee: &apos;When it comes to retirement, I will just have to downsize&apos; Fourteen years ago, Barbara Kydd&apos;s life changed when she divorced her husband and moved back to the UK after 20 years working in the far east. &quot;I was earning a decent salary and had a professional executive job,&quot; she says. &quot;But coming back was a major struggle and I had to start all over again. It&apos;s taken me years to start earning enough to put money aside. Even so, it&apos;s not much.&quot; Despite being with her current employer, a national travel company, for five years, Barbara has only just started contributing to its pension scheme.  &quot;I wasn&apos;t earning enough to save money for the future before,&quot; she says. &quot;I needed every penny. All the savings I&apos;d built up in Singapore went towards buying my house and putting my two children through university.&quot;  Since January, \u00a379 of her monthly pay has been going straight into her pension.  &quot;I have to work until I&apos;m 66, and in 10 years&apos; time my pension is going to be less than \u00a38,000, but at least I can build something up. My children have left the nest and my mother is in a nursing home; because I&apos;ve been taking care of her, I&apos;ve not been able to really look after myself financially. When it comes to retirement, I&apos;ll have to downsize.&quot; The 56-year old, who lives just outside Edinburgh, says she has no other savings. &quot;It&apos;s extremely difficult to save, but I take each day as it comes. Everything costs more - travel is expensive, council tax is expensive, food is expensive. But I live according to my cloth and I&apos;m not extravagant; even though my pension won&apos;t be worth anything, I think I&apos;ll be OK.&quot;Huma Qureshi So how much should you be saving? Tom McPhail, of financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, has provided a simple plan to help you get the most from your retirement, according to your age. Age 20 to 40 As a rule, anyone under 50 should join a company scheme or open their own private pension - either a stakeholder or self-investment plan. If you intend to ignore your savings once made, opt for a middle-of-the-road scheme in terms of risk. For a bumpier ride with more potential growth, pile into the emerging markets. If you want a pension income of \u00a310,000 a year at 65 and have no prior savings, you need to invest \u00a3200 a month. If you are 30, you need to invest \u00a3300. Age 40 to 55 Despite a report by pensions guru Ros Altmann that bonds have outperformed equities over the past 10 years, McPhail believes people of this age should still predominantly invest in equities. &quot;Bonds have only outperformed equities on four occasions in the past 100 years. On that basis I would still place more faith in the stock markets,&quot; he says. He recommends keeping about 70% to 80% in equities, with about half of that in the UK stock market. If you are 40, with no savings, you will need to invest \u00a3500 a month to achieve a \u00a310,000 income at 65. If you are 50 you will have to invest \u00a31,000 a month. Age 55 plus Normally McPhail recommends people start transferring a larger proportion of their savings from equities to bonds and cash at this stage, but given the stock market slump he suggests holding off for 12 months if you are five years or more from pension age. Although you can opt for automatic switches, which typically move 5% of your fund to safer investments each year, he thinks it is better to do it manually when the market looks good. Also, deferring the state pension for a year will boost its weekly income by 10.4%. \u2022 Have you saved enough?

House prices in the desert sheikhdom dropped by an extraordinary 40% in the first three months of 2009, outpacing falls anywhere else in the world after an investment bubble burst. Singapore, the nation worst hit by the collapse in world trade, saw the second biggest fall, with property prices down 16.2% in the quarter. Bucking the trend were Finland, where house prices rose 4% over the three months, and Jersey, where prices surged by 5.6%. The fall in sterling has prompted foreign buyers to snap up property in the channel island tax haven, making homes even more out of the reach of local buyers. A 16.5% price fall in the UK over 12 months placed it among the five countries with the biggest annual decline, but its quarterly decline, at 4.5%, was exceeded by many other countries. The global turnaround in house prices has been remarkable. A year ago, homes in Dubai were spiralling upwards on an annual growth rate of 48%. The boom spawned developments such as the Palm Jumeirah and Burj Dubai, the world&apos;s tallest tower, but now apartment blocks stand empty or half-finished. Dubai&apos;s ruling family, the Maktoums, have already sought a \u00a313.5bn emergency loan from their oil-rich neighbour Abu Dhabi, and fears are growing that many of the region&apos;s biggest properties companies are close to bankruptcy. Dubai &quot;is in a mess,&quot; said Nick Barnes, head of international residential research at Knight Frank. He added: &quot;The inescapable trend is that the worst and most widespread economic recession since the 1930s continues to batter housing markets across the globe. Rising unemployment and concern among those still in jobs, added to constrained credit conditions, means that buyer demand for housing remains suppressed and confidence is low in most markets, which is inevitably having a negative impact on house prices.&quot; Barnes is cautious about calling the bottom of the cycle for global house prices, with only anecdotal evidence of &quot;green shoots&quot;. &quot;There is sporadic evidence of buyers snapping up relative bargains, however of those buyers in a position to move, many are still waiting for clearer signs that markets are approaching the bottom of the cycle,&quot; he said. &quot;Moreover, in a falling market, sellers are usually forced to a greater or lesser extent which means that opportunities to buy are greatly reduced and transaction volumes correspondingly low.&quot; The countries which did not experience the long boom in prices seen in the Anglo-Saxon world are now apparently avoiding the bust. Switzerland, where house prices rose by an average of just 1.5% a year over the past two decades, saw a 2.1% quarter-on-quarter gain and 5.6% over the year. In Germany, prices fell by just 1.5% over the year. But Knight Frank admits that it has never been more difficult to access data about house prices, with extraordinary conditions in many markets delaying the publication of statistics. Prices in Latvia fell 36% over the year and in Poland by 13%, but neither country has yet provided figures for the first quarter of 2009.

There is not enough confidence out there, in the business market especially, and airlines are having to cut their prices to record lows,&quot; said a Virgin Atlantic spokesman. Last week, British Airways announced a record pre-tax loss of \u00a3401m, with the slump in business traffic exacerbating losses caused by high fuel costs and the weak pound. Virgin Atlantic announced a pre-tax profit of \u00a368.4m in the year to February 28, up from \u00a334.8m in the same period last year, but analysts cautioned that the figures were pushed into the black by a \u00a368m gain in operating income from the airline&apos;s dollar-denominated cash balances. The airline, which is privately-owned by Sir Richard&apos;s Virgin group and Singapore Airlines, did not publish full profit and loss accounts today. Analysts said Virgin Atlantic&apos;s prediction of a loss this year reflects its similarities with BA, although the smaller airline is more exposed to the less depressed leisure market. Virgin Atlantic, whose destinations include New York, Barbados and Sydney, carried 5.8 million passengers last year compared with 33 million at BA. &quot;These results show that the operating performance is not dissimilar to BA&apos;s,&quot; said Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. &quot;Virgin Atlantic must be suffering because it trades in the same markets as BA. But it has less exposure to the financial services sector and is stronger in longhaul leisure, which is holding up better than the overall market.&quot; Virgin Atlantic&apos;s results were flattered in comparison with BA&apos;s because its year-end, in February, allowed the airline to avoid putting March in its figures. A dire March contributed to BA&apos;s \u00a3401m loss, with more than three-quarters of that deficit being booked in the three months since January. Premium passengers are a vital revenue source for longhaul airlines such as Virgin Atlantic. BA relies on the front of the cabin for more than 50% of its revenues \u2013 more than close rivals Lufthansa and Air France. Premium air travel across the industry fell by 19% in March, according to the International Air Transport Association, with revenues from front-of-the-cabin customers falling by between 35% and 40% since the start of the year. The north Atlantic route, which accounts for a quarter of all turnover generated by premium tickets worldwide, declined by 16.8% in March. However, Europe&apos;s two largest low-cost carriers, Ryanair and easyJet, are expected to post profits in the next financial year. The airline market is currently dire and the IATA has predicted that global passenger traffic will fall 5.7% this year, with revenues falling by 12% as airlines hold down fares to compete for a smaller customer base. Despite cost-cutting measures including a 6% reduction in capacity, the industry is expected to record a loss of $4.7bn (\u00a33bn) this year. However, the plummeting oil price will at least ensure that the airlines&apos; deficit is less severe than the $8.5bn loss they posted last year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/27/royal-ascot-chechnya-president", "sentences": ["Having been sold to Kadyrov during the winter, Bankable went to the South African trainer Mike de Kock, who sent him out to be third in a Group One race in Singapore last week."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-27T00:02:00Z", "title": "Royal Ascot awaits 'Stalin of our times' and his Bankable lot", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Chechnya", "Sport", "Royal Ascot", "Ascot", "Europe", "Ramzan Kadyrov"], "article": "Racing&apos;s rulers admitted last night that they are powerless to prevent a horse running at Royal Ascot in the colours of a controversial man whose regime is widely suspected of involvement in a series of murders, as well as numerous incidents of kidnapping and torture. Ramzan Kadyrov, the 32-year-old president of Chechnya, has a horse with a live chance entered in next month&apos;s Royal Hunt Cup, where the owner&apos;s appalling international reputation will apparently be no bar to success. Kadyrov&apos;s name has been linked to recent murders of his political opponents in Dubai and Vienna, as well as the October 2006 killing of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who had described him as &quot;a Stalin of our times&quot; in her final interview. Kadyrov has denied any responsibility for these deaths. Nevertheless Human Rights Watch monitors were perturbed by the prospect of Kadyrov turning up at Ascot in top hat and tails, possibly accepting a trophy from a member of the royal family. &quot;There have been some very serious, public allegations about Kadyrov&apos;s involvement in human rights violations, torture, illegal detention and the like in Chechnya,&quot; said the organisation&apos;s Rachel Denber. &quot;In one case the victim was assassinated after he tried to file suit at the European Court of Human Rights, and in another, a victim simply disappeared after he gave an interview about his treatment. Kadyrov has always said he&apos;s not responsible for abuses. But the Russian government has a duty to fully investigate, which it hasn&apos;t. People who care about Ascot should know these facts.&quot; But the British Horseracing Authority will make no effort to protect the sport from any taint that might result from links with Kadyrov. Though aware of allegations against him, the BHA says its hands are tied by the limited criteria it uses in deciding to accept people as owners. A spokesman said: &quot;The current system asks two key questions of intending owners: have you ever been declared bankrupt or ever had a criminal conviction, other than a motoring offence, recorded against you? If the answers are yes to either of those questions, you have to provide the BHA with dates and full details before an ownership is processed. On the basis of answers given, the BHA then decides if a person is eligible for ownership status. There is a project to strengthen our specific criteria but this is currently with our legal team.&quot; The relative leniency of the BHA&apos;s system was highlighted recently when Pressing ran in a Group One race, the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury, in the colours of Gary Tanaka, who is facing jail in America after being convicted on three counts of securities fraud. Tanaka&apos;s licence to own racehorses in California was rescinded immediately upon his conviction. It is not known if Kadyrov has considered attending Royal Ascot, or if he would be allowed to enter the country. A Home Office spokesman said he was not on any list of excluded persons and that any visa application would be considered on its own merits. None has yet been received. Kadyrov&apos;s horse is Bankable, a highly talented but frustrating animal, familiar to many fans of Flat racing after his exploits for a different owner last year, when he won a Listed race at Goodwood but then ran up a string of second places. He was beaten only a length in the Group Two Celebration Mile by Raven&apos;s Pass, later recognised as one of the best horses in the world after winning the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic. Having been sold to Kadyrov during the winter, Bankable went to the South African trainer Mike de Kock, who sent him out to be third in a Group One race in Singapore last week. The horse was then switched to the Brighton-based trainer Gary Moore, arriving at his yard on Saturday night. Bankable would not be Kadyrov&apos;s first runner in Britain. His Mourilyan, also trained by Moore, was third in a Group Three race at Kempton last autumn. The trainer said at the time that he had discovered Kadyrov&apos;s reputation by searching for his name on the internet, throwing up results that Moore described as &quot;scary&quot;. In a surprise development Moore said last night he now expected Bankable to be transferred away from his yard and may be aimed at a race in Turkey. Ascot racecourse declined to comment but a spokesman accepted it might be &quot;sensible&quot; for the BHA to consider applying a &quot;fit and proper person&quot; test to prospective owners."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/may/26/nepal-royal-palace-museum", "sentences": ["Paras now lives in Singapore, partly for his own safety."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-27T09:25:27Z", "title": "Nepal's royal palace opens to the public", "tags": ["Nepal holidays", "Travel", "Heritage"], "article": "The two banknotes I handed over to get inside Kathmandu&apos;s newest museum told the story. On one were the mild features of King Birendra, whose reign ended in June 2001 when Birendra&apos;s son, the Eton-educated Crown Prince Dipendra, killed dad, mum, his brother and sister, and five others before turning the gun on himself. Allegedly. On the other, newer banknote, there is a picture of Mount Everest \u2013 and no king at all.  That&apos;s because Nepal&apos;s monarchy is now history. After years of grim authoritarianism and mismanagement by King Gyanendra, who succeeded his brother, Nepal&apos;s people finally got the chance to boot him out last year, via the ballot box. Gyanendra quite literally handed his crown to the new government and after 240 years, Nepal&apos;s ill-starred Shah royal dynasty was gone. So what to do with their digs? Even before Gyanendra quit the throne, plans were laid to turn the Narayanhiti palace into a national museum. This opened in February to intense public interest. Nepal&apos;s then prime minister, Maoist and former rebel leader Prachanda, cut the ribbon. Ordinary citizens queued round the block to see where Birendra died and how their recent monarchs lived. I had been behind the high steel fence surrounding the complex to cover the wedding of Gyanendra&apos;s daughter six years ago. But I hadn&apos;t been allowed inside. Instead, I drank sweet milk tea from plastic cups and marvelled at the baroque sight of South Asia&apos;s aristocracy gathered on the lawn. Now I was desperate to get beyond those vast palace doors. The building itself is a bit surreal. Looking at its salmon pink walls back in 2003, the phrase &quot;motel pagoda&quot; popped into my head to describe its architectural style. It was commissioned in 1966 by Birendra&apos;s father, Mahendra, from the American architect Benjamin Polk, then living in Delhi and running the biggest architectural practice in South Asia. The Kathmandu valley is full of crumbling Italianate palaces built a hundred years ago by Nepal&apos;s Rana family, the Maharajahs who kept the Shah kings as puppets until 1950. Mahendra wanted a new palace to show the break with the past. But Polk was a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright. And organic architecture may not have been the shrewdest option for an absolute monarch who regarded himself as an incarnation of Vishnu, even one with the taste of a Madison Avenue advertising executive. Polk was also rather undermined, as an American used to celebrating newly independent India - he designed the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial in Amritsar - in building for a king who had not long before stymied Nepal&apos;s first attempt at democracy. But the architect put a brave face on it. &quot;The building I would design would be a symbol by and for the people of Nepal,&quot; he later wrote. &quot;I make no apologies to those who think these expensive public symbols are out of place where people are in poverty. On the contrary, tangible rallying points are needed more than ever in new nations.&quot; Polk got one thing right. The front of the palace complex did become a rallying point for ordinary Nepalese in their long struggle to establish democracy and ultimately get rid of the king who lived inside. Time and again armed police or soldiers faced crowds gathered in front of the steel gates. Now I was stepping through, that struggle finally over, alongside a crowd of young people getting a chance to see, after more than 40 years, how their money had been spent. The short answer to that is: not well. Of the 52 rooms, only 19 are currently open to the public. Little has been done to update Polk&apos;s original interiors, a fading paean to 1960s consumerism with a Himalayan twist. These are not rooms to be comfortable in but clearly cost huge sums to decorate. They are packed with the sort of geegaws world leaders like to share, mostly dating from the 60s and 70s, before Nepal&apos;s lustre began to fade. The Shahs were once the kind of royal family the Windsors could snuggle up to, and so there are plenty of shots of the Queen and other royals. The most poignant shot for me was a photograph of Birendra with General Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan. Both dead (one assassinated the other a victim of a mysterious plane crash), both heads of state of Himalayan nations that now barely function. Interspersed among the detritus of state visits are more personal touches, a fabulous chair with built-in speaks favoured by Mahendra, a group of china owls that look like they came from Poundstretcher. Eclectic is not the word. Most confusing of all is the throne room, its four concrete columns representing banana tree trunks, decorated with garish Hindu deities. Far more interesting was watching the crowds. Many women had put on their best saris for the tour, and peered with rapt attention at each item. Two men asked the attendant in Gyanendra&apos;s study what it was exactly that went on here. The debris left behind after a regime has outstayed its welcome is somehow funny and dispiriting at the same time. Outside, the crowds were stepping carefully through the outline of the building where Birendra was shot, a suite of rooms that predates the new palace. It was here that the family liked to relax and where Dipendra finally snapped. The rooms were demolished soon after. Many Nepalese believe that Gyanendra and his despised son Paras were somehow behind the massacre. Paras now lives in Singapore, partly for his own safety. Signs point out bullet holes in the wall, and a small flight of steps has been rebuilt to indicate where Dipendra, according to official reports, caught up with his mother. Thwarted by her from marrying his girlfriend, who wasn&apos;t quite posh enough for the Shahs, he treated her with savage cruelty, shooting off her face. The Maoist government were talking about building a convention centre in the grounds immediately in front of Polk&apos;s strange pink facade. Given the current standard of most new buildings in Kathmandu, it wouldn&apos;t have been an improvement. But as I examined the faded glory of the Shahs, Prachanda was resigning his post as prime minister. Narayanhiti is safe for a while.

Invited to reform the city in 1541, almost as what would now be called a management consultant, he formed an alliance with the city fathers. Over the next 20 years of preaching and pastoring they turned this tiny city, with a population then of only 10,000, into a model of church government and theology which has changed the world.  His followers now form the third-largest Christian grouping in the world. The world alliance of reformed churches claims 75 million members, and while this is a lower headline figure than the Anglican Communion&apos;s 80 million, it is not inflated by 25 million nominal Anglicans in Britain.  Although Calvinism is shrinking in western Europe and North America, it is experiencing an extraordinary success in China. I spent some time on Monday talking to the Rev May Tan, from Singapore, where the overseas Chinese community has close links with mainland China. The story she told of the spread of Calvinist religion as an elite religion in China was quite extraordinary. There may be some parallels with the growth of Calvinism in South Korea, where the biggest presbyterian churches in the world are to be found, but it&apos;s absolutely unlike the pattern in Africa and Latin America. There, the fastest growing forms of Christianity are pentecostal, and they are spreading among the poor.  But in China neither of those things are to be true. Calvinists despise pentecostalists. They shudder at unbridled emotion. If they are slain in the spirit, it is with a single, decorous thump: there&apos;s to be no rolling afterwards. And in China, the place where Calvinism is spreading fastest is the elite universities, fuelled by prodigies of learning and translation. Wang Xiaochao, a philosopher at one of the Beijing universities, has translated the two major works of St Augustine, the Confessions and the City of God, into Chinese directly from Latin. Gradually all the major works of the first centuries of the Christian tradition are being translated directly from the original languages into Chinese. All of this is happening outside the control of the official body which is supposed to monitor and supervise the churches in China. Instead, it is the philosophy departments at the universities, or the language departments and the departments of literature and western civilisation that are the channel.  &quot;The [officially recognised] churches are not happy with universities, because it is not within their control. And their seminaries are not at the intellectual level of the universities,&quot; says Dr Tan. &quot;Chinese Christianity using Chinese to do Christian thinking has become a very interesting movement.&quot; Many of the missionaries who tried to bring Christianity to China before the communists took over where presbyterians, and other sorts of Calvinist. But that does not explain why Calvinism should be the preferred theology of the house churches and the intellectuals now. Dr Tan suggests that this is because it is Protestant: that is to say it can be made much more convincingly native than Roman Catholicism, since presbyterian congregations choose their own pastors. This is, I suspect, enormously important at a time when China is recovering from a century and a half of being the victim of western powers; the pope&apos;s insistence on appointing Catholic bishops is unacceptable to the government and perhaps to the people too. If she goes to preach at an official church, she says, &quot;There will be perhaps 1000 people and 95% of them are over 65. So it&apos;s a sunset church. But if I went to house church \u2013 there would be 1000 people; perhaps 20 of them in their 50s, and all the rest are youngsters. The older ones will all be professors at the universities. So these are the future of the churches. They have registered pastors, and no access to seminaries: But they have youth, and future, and money.&quot; Calvinism isn&apos;t a religion of subservience to any government. The great national myths of Calvinist cultures are all of wars against imperialist oppressors: the Dutch against the Spanish, the Scots against the English; the Americans against the British. So when the Chinese house churches first emerged from the rubble of the Cultural Revolution in the 80s and 90s &quot;They began to search what theology will support and inform [them]. They read Luther and said, &apos;not him&apos;. So they read Calvin, and they said &apos;him, because he has a theology of resistance.&apos; Luther can&apos;t teach them or inform them how to deal with a government that is opposition.&quot; And, though the communists stigmatised Christianity as a foreign religion, they also and still more thoroughly smashed up the traditional religions of China: &quot;The communist, socialist critique of traditional religion, and of Confucianism has been effective&quot;, she says: &quot;The youngsters think it is very cool to be Christian. Communism has removed all the obstacles for them to come to Christianity.&quot; The most conservative estimates of the new converts to Christianity is 500,000; there is a new church built every month. Calvinist Christianity has a culture of phenomenal industry. Calvin himself, in his time in Geneva, preached every day and twice on Sundays: shorthand writers at the foot of his pulpit took down 108 volumes of his sermons, though most of these have been lost and his reputation rests on the books and pamphlets that he wrote himself. In China now, this kind of Christianity is seen as forward-looking, rational, intellectually serious, and favourable to making money. &quot;Very soon&quot;, said Dr Tan, &quot;Christians will become the majority of university students \u2026 that could happen.&quot;  It would be astonishing if China were to become a great power in the Christian world, as well as in the economic one. But things just as strange have happened in the past. Who could have foreseen, when Augustine was writing those huge books now translated into Chinese, that barbarous Europe would become the centre of Christian civilisation, and his homeland in North Africa would become entirely Muslim?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/28/sea-the-stars-derby-john-oxx", "sentences": ["A 6-1 shot, Ricky Yiu&apos;s six-year-old came right back to his best when winning a Group One in Singapore recently."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-27T23:05:09Z", "title": "Epsom record of Guineas winners a further plus for Fame And Glory", "tags": ["Sea The Stars", "Horse racing", "Sport", "The Derby"], "article": "John Oxx, the trainer of Sea The Stars, is under no illusion about the task facing his 2,000 Guineas winner in the Investec Derby on Saturday week. He describes the colt&apos;s chance of staying the mile and a half as only &quot;50-50&quot;, an honest appraisal from a trainer who always tells it like it is. One of the more fanciful notions put about in the build-up to this year&apos;s Derby is the idea that an Epsom winner can get home on class alone, without truly staying 12 furlongs. Punters assessing next week&apos;s Classic should dismiss that possibility straight away. Only two Guineas winners have won the Derby in the last 40 years, the latest Nashwan in 1989. It is true that two of the last three Epsom winners were placed at Newmarket and New Approach certainly got the trip when successful last year. However, subsequent events suggest Sir Percy won one of the weakest Derbys of modern times when scrambling home in 2006. Sea The Stars, who is a half-brother to the 2001 Derby winner Galileo, may well prove effective over the extra half-mile. But class alone will not be enough if his stamina gives out in the final run to the winning post. It was staying power that carried Galileo to Derby success over the 2,000 Guineas winner, Golan, and the contrast was even more stark a year later when High Chaparral wore down Hawk Wing to score by two lengths after the Guineas second cruised upsides with what looked a race-winning challenge two furlongs from home. Aidan O&apos;Brien, the trainer of Hawk Wing, High Chaparral and Galileo, is responsible for nine of the 20 colts left in the Derby, and the annual guessing game as to which is Ballydoyle&apos;s best has been spiced up by stable jockey Johnny Murtagh apparently leaning towards the 2,000 Guineas fourth, Rip Van Winkle. Looking beyond the smoke and mirrors, I will be amazed if Fame And Glory is not the stable&apos;s main contender, and possibly has been ever since he won the Ballysax Stakes at Leopardstown in April at a time when the O&apos;Brien horses had not yet come to hand. By following up in the Group Two Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial, Fame And Glory is on the same path taken by Galileo and High Chaparral, as well as Oxx&apos;s 2000 Derby winner, Sinndar. Fame And Glory&apos;s five-length success in the Derrinstown, achieved in a smart time giving 3lb to Oxx&apos;s Mourayan, was everything you could wish to see in a potential Derby winner. Add in the fact that he is by Montjeu, who has already sired two Derby winners \u2013 Motivator and Authorized \u2013 in his short time at stud and his Epsom credentials are there for all to see. Murtagh may not yet be convinced, but the 7-2 currently available with Paddy Power and William Hill may well prove to be value in nine days&apos; time.

But this week another explosion shook China and the new threat is from its old ally. North Korea&apos;s nuclear test has raised tensions throughout the region \u2013 and increased pressure on China to rein in its neighbour. China provides as much as 90% of the North&apos;s energy and 40% of its food. Like Russia, it has used its security council veto against attempts to isolate Pyongyang. Without its support, its poor neighbour would struggle to survive. But now it appears that the North may be exhausting Beijing&apos;s patience. This week&apos;s nuclear and missile tests, last month&apos;s rocket launch, increasing threats and the suspected restarting of the Yongbyon nuclear plant have reignited debate about how best to deal with a troublesome neighbour. Beijing was swift to slap down the nuclear test in a rare act of public criticism and the US appears hopeful that it will sign a security council resolution toughening existing sanctions \u2013 agreed in 2006, but only loosely enforced &quot;This time, North Korea has gone too far,&quot; said Zhang Liangui, a Korea expert at Beijing&apos;s Central Party School, which trains Communist party officials. &quot;What they have done has hurt its relationship with China.&quot; In Li&apos;s boyhood, Mao Zedong declared that China and North Korea were &quot;as close as lips and teeth&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers died fighting for the North. But now, China fears North Korea&apos;s sabre-rattling could prompt or justify Japanese remilitarisation, further defence spending in the South or increase US military support for Seoul \u2013 shifting the regional balance of power to its disadvantage. Any military skirmish could have a devastating impact on Sino-South Korean relations. &quot;If they launch even a limited conflict with South Korea, China will face immediate strategic and diplomatic problems,&quot; said Professor Shi Yinhong, a foreign policy expert at Renmin University. But analysts see a deeper reason behind China&apos;s growing anger towards Pyongyang. North Korea&apos;s aggression is widely regarded as an attempt to grab the attention of the new US administration and force it to engage. As such, they posit, it reflects Pyongyang&apos;s distrust and dislike of its protector. &quot;Of course Beijing is mad about it,&quot; said Professor Huang Jing, an expert on north Asia security and currently visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. &quot;The North is basically saying: we don&apos;t trust you \u2013 we are going to speak to Washington directly.&quot; For now, however, Dandong is where North Korea meets the world; in so far as such a closed country cares to meet it at all. For most Chinese, the closest they get is posing in traditional Korean dress for a snapshot at the Broken Bridge, or taking a tourist boat along the river and peering at their neighbours through binoculars. Armed North Korean guards ensure that no one gets too close. Until the 1970s, the North was relatively prosperous compared to its neighbour. Now looking across the river is &quot;like looking into China in the 50s&quot;, said one resident. &quot;Everyone&apos;s on bicycles and they all seem to wear the same coloured clothes.&quot; Along the upper reaches of the Yalu, North Koreans wash clothes and bathe off the banks. Cyclists pedal along the long shore road and the only vehicles are a police car and a workers&apos; truck. But the real difference is evident as one comes closer to Dandong, a city of bulldozers, cranes and high rises; of gaudy karaoke bars and flashy restaurants, zooming cars and tourist tat. Sinujiu has a ferris wheel, but it does not turn. Few boats seem to arrive at its docks; smoke emerges from only one of the factory chimneys. As night falls, the contrast between these worlds grows starker. The lights on the Friendship Bridge stop halfway \u2014 a startling reminder of North Korea&apos;s fuel poverty. While neon lights the Chinese skyline, the opposite shore is shrouded in darkness. Many in Dandong feel sympathy as well as exasperation for their struggling neighbours. &quot;Maybe they wouldn&apos;t do things like this test if places like Japan weren&apos;t so mean to them,&quot; one resident suggested. Historical amity and education plays its part; the city is, after all, home to the Chinese Memorial Hall of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. So too does trade. Figures from a Seoul-based business association suggest China&apos;s share of the North&apos;s trade rose from less than a third in 2003 to almost three-quarters in 2008, when exports hit $2bn (\u00a31.2bn). More than two-thirds of the goods comes via this city daily, in lorries shuttling across the Friendship Bridge bearing instant noodles and flour but also spirits, electric rice cookers and even vehicles for the favoured elite. In the streets around the city&apos;s customs house, North Korean traders stock up on Chinese cigarettes, clothing and electrical goods. But Yu Yanhua, who runs a small grocery store, said trade has taken a hit in recent days. &quot;They&apos;ve been checking more strictly at customs since the nuclear test,&quot; he said. &quot;I worry that it&apos;s going to get worse.&quot; Tougher action is not unprecedented. As well as clear diplomatic condemnation of weapons tests, China briefly cut off oil supplies in 2003, and again three years later after the North&apos;s first nuclear and long distance missile test. It has tightened visas for North Koreans and helped scrutinise bank accounts when the US treasury sought to clamp down on North Korea&apos;s international banking. &quot;Beijing has really shifted its position since the first long-range missile test and particularly nuclear test [in 2006],&quot; said Eric Hagt, director of the China programme at the Centre for Defence Information in Washington. He pointed to a party meeting that year which described a nuclear North Korea as a challenge to China&apos;s &quot;core interests&quot;. Yet China fears the instability economic action could bring. There are already thought to be around 50,000 North Koreans living illicitly in China; the last thing Beijing wants is millions of refugees flooding across the border. The Associated Press reported this week that construction of a massive concrete and barbed wire fence along vulnerable parts of the Yalu River appeared to have been stepped up in recent days. China&apos;s ability to contain North Korea is critical to its influence in the region. Yet the more it exercises that power, the more hostile the North becomes. &quot;China does not want to push Pyongyang away. The bottom line is that \u2013 like everyone else \u2013 China does not want to solve other people&apos;s problems with its resources,&quot; said Huang. Those sentiments are felt on Dandong&apos;s waterfront as well as in Beijing. &quot;I&apos;m certainly worried by the test ... They are trying to prove they are an international power,&quot; said 18-year-old Yang Ya, who felt the North was now more of a threat than the US. &quot;But I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to ask China to handle it all. This is everyone&apos;s problem.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/30/north-korea-missile-test-fears", "sentences": ["&quot;We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in Asia \u2013 or on us,&quot; Robert Gates told a regional defence meeting in Singapore.", "At the defence meeting in Singapore, Chinese Lt Gen Ma Xiaotian said Beijing was &quot;resolutely opposed to nuclear proliferation&quot;, but called on nations to &quot;remain cool-headed&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-30T09:28:17Z", "title": "North Korea preparing possible long-range missile test", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "US national security", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Spy satellites have spotted signs that North Korea may be preparing to transport another long-range missile to a test-launch site, South Korean officials said today, as the US defence secretary issued his harshest warning to the North since its recent nuclear test. &quot;We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in Asia \u2013 or on us,&quot; Robert Gates told a regional defence meeting in Singapore. He said the North&apos;s nuclear program was a &quot;harbinger of a dark future&quot;, but wasn&apos;t yet a direct threat. Since the nuclear blast on Monday, North Korea has test-launched six short-range missiles and announced it was abandoning a 1953 truce ending fighting in the Korean War. The communist state appears to be preparing to move a long-range missile by train from a weapons factory near Pyongyang to its north-eastern Musudan-ni launch pad, a South Korean defence ministry official said. Images of the movements were captured by US satellites. North Korea will need about two weeks to complete the launch preparation, South Korea&apos;s Yonhap news agency reported. The missile might be tested around 16 June, when the US and South Korean presidents are to meet in Washington, Yonhap quoted an unidentified intelligence official as saying. The agency said the size of the missile was similar to that of a long-range rocket the North tested in April. Experts have said the three-stage rocket has a potential range of more than 4,100 miles (6,700km), putting Alaska within striking distance. Officials in Washington said yesterday they had noticed indications of increased activity at the test site, but did not provide many details. The UN has been negotiating a new resolution in response to the North&apos;s nuclear test, the second it has conducted. A partial draft resolution obtained by the Associated Press calls on all countries to immediately enforce sanctions imposed by an earlier resolution after the North&apos;s first test in 2006. The sanctions include a partial arms embargo, a ban on luxury goods and ship searches for illegal weapons or material. They have been sporadically implemented, with many of the 192 UN member states ignoring them. The draft would also have the security council condemn &quot;in the strongest terms&quot; the North&apos;s recent nuclear test &quot;in flagrant violation and disregard&quot; of the 2006 resolution. At the defence meeting in Singapore, Chinese Lt Gen Ma Xiaotian said Beijing was &quot;resolutely opposed to nuclear proliferation&quot;, but called on nations to &quot;remain cool-headed&quot;. The South Korean defence minister, Lee Sang-hee, said the test &quot;has made a solution of the North Korean nuclear problem more difficult&quot;. North Korea has said it conducted the nuclear test in self-defence. It has accused the US of planning a pre-emptive strike to oust the regime of its leader, Kim Jong Il \u2013 an allegation Washington has repeatedly denied. North Korea has warned it will not accept sanctions or other punitive measures from the security council. Some analysts say one of the aims of the North&apos;s nuclear and missile tests is to strengthen Kim&apos;s regime and boost morale in the impoverished nation. Rallies were being held across the country for citizens and soldiers who were celebrating the nuclear test, the North&apos;s official Korean central news agency said today. It said speakers offered their &quot;ardent congratulations&quot; to nuclear scientists and engineers for bolstering the country&apos;s dignity."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/31/north-korea-missile-tests-washington", "sentences": ["The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, used the opportunity of a security conference in Singapore to force home America&apos;s view that North Korea&apos;s recent nuclear test and missile launches were seen as a direct threat.", "In his speech in Singapore, Gates warned that America would hold Pyongyang &quot;fully accountable&quot; for the proliferation of any nuclear material or technology."], "publicationDate": "2009-05-30T23:01:00Z", "title": "Nuclear-armed North Korea is 'not acceptable', warns US", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "article": "America has warned it &quot;will not accept&quot; a nuclear-armed North Korea as new intelligence data showed that the secretive state was preparing a fresh missile launch, which could take place in two weeks&apos; time.

The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, used the opportunity of a security conference in Singapore to force home America&apos;s view that North Korea&apos;s recent nuclear test and missile launches were seen as a direct threat. &quot;We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us... we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state,&quot; he said. North Korea has test-fired six missiles since detonating a nuclear device on Monday, with the latest being a short-range missile launch on Friday. In a statement, North Korea denounced its critics as &quot;hypocrites&quot; and warned of &quot;adopting self-defensive countermeasures&quot; if action were taken against it at the UN. According to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, spy satellites have captured images that show the country is busy preparing more tests. The images appear to show an intercontinental ballistic missile being moved by train from the capital to a launch pad at Musudan-ri in the north-east of the country. The missile is thought to be a Taepodong-2, which is in theory capable of hitting US soil. The missile could be launched within two weeks. Other images show vehicle activity at test sites and Chinese fishing boats fleeing the area. South Korean and US forces in the region have been placed on the second-highest alert level. The last time the joint forces raised the &quot;Watchcon&quot; surveillance alert was after a 2006 North Korean test that proved the regime was a nuclear power. North Korea has said that it no longer considers itself bound by the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953 and ushered in five decades of uneasy peace on the peninsula. There is huge speculation about what North Korea seeks to gain by raising the tension levels. The impoverished country may be using its nuclear programme as a bargaining tool to obtain aid and ease sanctions. But there is also the possibility that recent developments are linked to the country&apos;s murky internal politics. Its leader, Kim Jong-il, is believed to be in failing health and there is no clear line of succession.  Washington does not fear a direct attack by North Korea, but is concerned that the country will export its nuclear technology to other rogue states or terrorist networks. The country, crippled by sanctions and its own disastrous economy, has already acquired billions of dollars by secretly exporting missile technology to the Middle East and Pakistan. In his speech in Singapore, Gates warned that America would hold Pyongyang &quot;fully accountable&quot; for the proliferation of any nuclear material or technology. &quot;The transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the US and our allies. And we would hold North Korea fully accountable,&quot; Gates said.  However, co-ordinating an effective international diplomatic response to North Korea has not been easy. Russia and China have stymied efforts to isolate the country at the UN, preventing a united front to condemn the country&apos;s nuclear ambitions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/may/31/property-overseas-investors", "sentences": ["Ups and downs How house prices have moved overseas Biggest price falls, first quarter 2009 Dubai down 40.0% Singapore down 16.2% Estonia down 9.9% Norway down 6.2% Denmark down 6.1% Biggest price rises, first quarter 2009 Jersey up 5.6% Finland up 4% Thailand up 2.7% Israel up 2.6% Switzerland up 2.1% Source: Knight Frank \u2022 Have you had your fingers burnt buying overseas or have you had a positive experience?"], "publicationDate": "2009-05-30T23:01:00Z", "title": "The overseas property dream that continues to end in nightmares", "tags": ["Buying property abroad", "Property", "Money", "Scams"], "article": "Back in 2006, Andrew and Pat Pryce decided to buy an investment property in Bulgaria.

The Pryces are not alone. Since January 2008, the Association of International Property Professionals (AIPP) - a voluntary organisation with 376 members - has received 116 formal complaints from buyers unhappy about purchases abroad.  The number of people who have lost money in projects around the world is likely to be far higher than most realise, partly because nobody is keeping a record, and partly because those who have lost money are too embarrassed - and upset - to talk about it.  John Howell, senior partner in the International Law Partnership, specialising in overseas property purchases, estimates that 20% of those who have bought off-plan in the past two years are likely to run into &quot;significant difficulty&quot;. According to AIPP estimates, in 2007 193,600 of us bought property in the 10 countries most favoured by British buyers. This means more than 38,000 may be in hot water from just a single year&apos;s overseas property purchases - and some may not even realise it yet.  The collapse of Churchill Properties Overseas alone meant about 340 investors, mainly British and Irish, lost deposits worth an estimated \u00a34m. The company, which sold property in Estonia, Cape Verde and Goa, went into &quot;voluntary liquidation&quot; last summer.  Out of pocket Another high-profile company, Bulgarian Dreams, closed at the end of 2008 and is currently being investigated by the City of London Police economic crime department. It is impossible to know exactly how many of its investors - who have bought in more than 40 developments in the eastern European country - have been left out of pocket. Some of the estimated 100-150 investors who, like the Pryces, bought off-plan apartments in the Mechi Chal lodge, are leaving desperate posts on property forums and seeking legal action to get their money back.  Ben Mason, a partner of Someplace Else, says the delays have been caused by the local water authority rescinding permission it had previously granted. He is hoping to get it reinstated. &quot;Providing this happens in the next two months, we can get the first phase finished by December this year and the second phase completed by December next year,&quot; he says. Mason admits the development is hard to find, but claims that the foundations are in place for phase one, many of the houses have been built off-site and when they do get water permission, the Bulgarian office will reopen.  As for the Pryces&apos; deposit, he says: &quot;Due to the current economic climate, it has taken us longer than we expected to make this refund from the UK ... however, there is no question of the Pryces not receiving the balance of their deposit, with interest, over the next few weeks.&quot;  Howell notes that the developers in trouble are not typically local but British would-be Donald Trumps, and new to the game. &quot;Many of these developers probably started off with good intentions but soon got in over their heads,&quot; he says. &quot;Whether it was fraud or bad economic times is a moot point, frankly, because the end result is the same: people lose money.&quot; Bad lands Derek Smythe (not his real name) is more than aware of his predicament, and resigned to losing the \u00a330,000 he invested in 2006 into a company that promised to buy land in Montenegro, get planning permission, build and sell on.  &quot;Since investing the money, I&apos;ve had virtually no communication from the directors [both British],&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s no evidence that the money was used to purchase any land at all - I have absolutely no idea what happened to it. It&apos;s been pretty miserable - and the worst thing is, it&apos;s all my fault as I didn&apos;t ask enough questions.&quot; The sums of money being lost are vast: Howell recently met 70 people, mainly Britons, who had sunk an average of \u20ac80,000 (\u00a370,000) into a troubled development in Bulgaria.  He also has clients who regret buying in Dubai. &quot;The problem is that all the major building companies belong to the royal family, and you won&apos;t find a lawyer who will sue.&quot; The range of people losing money this way spans class, gender and age: young, old, working class, middle class, the gullible, the naive and the greedy are all suffering alike.  &quot;I&apos;ve got clients who are working-class people who invested the \u00a320,000 equity they had in their home, and high-flying professionals who frankly ought to have known better,&quot; says Howell, adding that one client who got stung was a partner in a chartered accountancy firm. Many of these problems would not have happened if the investors had sought the advice of a good lawyer - something that many of the people interviewed for this article bitterly regret not doing.

On Saturday the Guardian revealed that Damilvany Gnanakumar, 26, was detained after spending months helping the wounded at temporary hospitals inside the so-called no-fire zone. Today a Sri Lankan government official said her case had been taken up by the human rights minister, Mahinda Samarasinghe, who had asked the government agent in charge of the camps to locate Gnanakumar and establish whether she could be released. Negotiations between the Foreign Office and the Sri Lankan government have so far failed to free her, prompting her family, from Chingford, north-east London, to launch an appeal to the authorities in Colombo. Gnanakumar is being held in the Menik Farm camp near the town of Vavuniya, along with tens of thousands of other civilians who fled during the later stages of the conflict in which the Sri Lankan military finally defeated Tamil Tiger rebels after 26 years of war. Conditions in the camps have been criticised by human rights groups, with the UN acknowledging that it has received reports of a number of cases of rape in the camps. Officials stressed that the Sri Lankan government was determined to clamp down on any such abuses. There have also been report of women&apos;s bodies being discovered outside the barbed wire perimeter. The Sri Lankan government today rebuffed international complaints over its use of barbed wire, arguing that it is a common fencing method in Sri Lanka used by its citizens to keep out intruders. It does, however, concede that those inside the camp are not free to leave. Meanwhile, the country&apos;s foreign minister, Rohitha Bogollagama, said Sri Lanka&apos;s courts not international organisations would investigate or prosecute security personnel for any alleged human rights violations. &quot;Sri Lanka is a sovereign country with its own legal framework,&quot; he said, while attending a security conference in Singapore. &quot;We have a very strong separation of powers and the judiciary is independent.&quot; He did not mention the allegations of large-scale civilian deaths. &quot;Sri Lanka will no doubt enter the annals of history as a classic textbook example of a nation that successfully prevailed over the scourge of terrorism, while tenaciously upholding the cherished values of democracy and human rights,&quot; he said. There have been claims that as many as 20,000 people died in the final stages of the war, but those figures have been disputed by the UN. The UN undersecretary general, Sir John Holmes, said the true figure may never be known. The Sri Lankan government disputes the high casualty figures, although there is plenty of evidence to suggest that thousands of civilians did die as a result of government air and artillery attacks and at the hands of the Tamil Tigers, who have been accused of using the civilians as human shields."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2009/jun/01/crossword-editor-update", "sentences": ["Certainly, the London Eye features in all lists of the world&apos;s tallest Ferris wheels, though now (at 135 metres) it can only claim to be Europe&apos;s highest, not the world&apos;s.

There is the regular diet of fruit and vegetables. Are tomatoes and cucumbers vegetables (which is certainly the section where they are to be found in my supermarket) or, in order to keep the biologists happy, must they be &apos;fruit eaten as a vegetable&apos;; is the potato a vegetable (as in &apos;meat and two veg&apos;) or must it be an edible tuber? (Rhubarb, of course, is a vegetable eaten as a fruit.) Then there are the chemists who get upset if, for example, you call magnesia a carbonate (as my chemist does when I ask for something for my indigestion) on the grounds that (chemically) it is an oxide (of magnesium).

And so on. In April a solver took objection to Shed&apos;s use of the word &apos;penises&apos; (No 24,681 11 ac, 23 April), not as might have been expected on grounds of taste and decency, but because the plural of &apos;penis&apos; should properly be &apos;penes&apos;. I was tempted to reply that it was Guardian house style not to use pedantic Latin spellings when perfectly good English ones are available, but didn&apos;t in order to keep my options open for a later date. I put up both hands at once, though, when Christine of Nantwich objected to &apos;octopi&apos; appearing as a solution in Quick No 12,176 (15 ac, 19 May). As octopus comes from Greek not Latin, the pedantically correct plural is &apos;octopodes&apos;, but Guardian house style is firmly &apos;octopuses&apos;. In my view though, there is still a position that can be held against a belated complaint that the answer to &apos;Wheel such as the Eye (6)&apos; cannot be FERRIS (Quick No 11,813 6 ac, 19 March 2008), because a ferris wheel revolves on a spindle that is supported on both sides, whereas the London Eye is of an entirely different and new design, ie it is a cantilevered observation wheel (with 32 passenger capsules, one for each of the Greater London boroughs, if you have an appetite for useless information) and is only supported on one side. As everyone, of course, knows, the first such wheel was built by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr for the World&apos;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 with the aim of trumping the Eiffel Tower, which had been the iconic symbol of the 1889 Paris Exposition. It is true that all subsequent large observation wheels except the London Eye have rotated round an axle that is supported on both sides. But, when Mr Ferris&apos;s name was adopted as the word for such wheels, I can find no evidence that the exact method of construction and/or operation became an integral part of the dictionary definition: which seems to be &apos;an upright wheel with observational gondolas for passengers attached&apos;. Certainly, the London Eye features in all lists of the world&apos;s tallest Ferris wheels, though now (at 135 metres) it can only claim to be Europe&apos;s highest, not the world&apos;s. It has been topped by others, with the Singapore Flyer, opened in March last year, the highest of them all at 165 metres. To be forced to define the London Eye as a &quot;cantilevered observation wheel&quot; rather than as a Ferris wheel seems a touch pedantic (and also a bit unfair to the memory of the good GWG Ferris Jr). _____ I am regularly asked why the time at which the daily puzzles appear on the website fluctuates. The two groups that seem most upset by the variations are those living in time zones west of Greenwich, who want to do tomorrow&apos;s puzzle before they go to sleep, and those living in Europe, who want to download them in order to take to work. The answer is that in principle, the next day&apos;s puzzles should load automatically at midnight UK time. Even when this timed program works as it should, there will be (often surprisingly long) variations in when you can actually get a given puzzle on your computer, which depends on the route your service provider chooses to take on its way to the Guardian server. On the unhappy days when there is a hitch, the fact that the puzzles have not uploaded properly will not be discovered until the morning shift comes into work. In these cases, discovery and correction of whatever has gone wrong may not be possible until about 8am UK time, or perhaps even slightly later. If, to this news, you react that in 2009 computers and their programs ought to be more reliable, I shall not disagree but shall just say that I am only the messenger bringing you the news. _____ For some reason not clear to me there was a period in May when the PDF downloads of the daily puzzles contracted some disease, which caused them to use up around 10 times more disc space per PDF, ie up from about 44K to about 420K, which obviously slowed transmission especially for those without broadband. I am told that the cause of this problem has been identified and was quarantined before it led to a full-scale pandemic, but please let me know if there is any similar outbreak in future. _____ The Genius entry numbers seem to be creeping upwards. The May puzzle attracted 319 correct entries. The first was received at 08.27 GMT from Jeremy at Canberra, Australia and the first from the UK from Tony at Uxbridge, Middlesex 27 minutes later. In all there were 31 correct entries on the first day. In passing I have to say that I got some satisfaction from the fact that there was only one complaint to the effect that all the letter counts for the across clues in the May puzzle were incorrect: eg that for 7 ac (9,3) was indicated for a space that did not have 12 letters available.

Born Daniel Patrick Carroll in Ireland in 1927, La Rue was brought to England at the age of nine, and his family settled in London. The youngest of three children, he was evacuated to Devon during the blitz and worked in an Exeter shop after leaving school at the age of 15. La Rue first donned wig and eyelashes during a navy concert party in Singapore at the end of the second world war. He acquired his stage name early on, but disliked being called a drag artist, preferring the title &quot;comic in a frock&quot;. La Rue made his London debut at the tiny Irving theatre and worked with Barbara Windsor, who remained a close friend, after he broke into cabaret. As his stage act grew even bigger, he opened his own nightclub in Hanover Square in 1964. The venture was a huge success, attracting more than 13,000 members and shooting La Rue to fame. Judy Garland, Warren Beatty, Shirley Bassey, No\u00ebl Coward, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Elizabeth Taylor were all patrons. La Rue went on to appear in pantomime in the 1960s, becoming one of the highest-paid entertainers of the decade. He clocked up 53 panto roles over the course of his 54-year career, andmade theatrical history by becoming the first man to play a female role in a major musical when he took the part of the titular matchmaker in Hello, Dolly! He later said of that role: &quot;It took me 20 years to make something that wasn&apos;t acceptable, acceptable. I mean, it&apos;s not funny just to put on a frock and a wig.

Following the death of his partner and manager, Jack Hanson, in 1984, La Rue developed a drinking problem and financial troubles, revealed in his 1987 autobiography, From Drags to Riches. He suffered a stroke in 2006, but had a cameo on stage the following year at Benidorm Palace in Spain, appearing in a biographical show entitled Hello Danny. Jerry Lane played the role of La Rue.

The new missile reportedly has a range of up to 4,000 miles, which would put Alaska within striking distance, the JoongAng Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, said. The missile launched in April travelled 2,000 miles before landing harmlessly in the Pacific Ocean. The Dong-a Ilbo newspaper, citing unidentified officials in Seoul and Washington, said the launch could take place to coincide with a meeting between President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart, Lee Myung-bak, on 16 June. North Korea has also made the mid and upper reaches of the Yellow Sea a &quot;no-sail&quot; zone until the end of July \u2013 an unusually long period \u2013 in another sign it is planning to conduct a sensitive military exercise. The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said today that satellites had picked up activity pointing towards a missile test. &quot;We have seen some signs that they may be doing something with another Taepodong-2 missile,&quot; he said during a visit to Manila. &quot;But at this point it is not clear what they are going to do.&quot; Gates said he would wait until the US had sounded out other countries before commenting on a possible response to the latest escalation in the crisis. The deputy US secretary of state, James Steinberg, is visiting several countries this week to discuss the issue. &quot;With respect to the team that is visiting Tokyo, Seoul, Moscow and Beijing, I think it&apos;s important for us to take it a step at a time and I&apos;d rather not presume that we will not be successful in gaining a broad agreement on the way forward,&quot; Gates told reporters. The North&apos;s increasingly provocative behaviour has clearly irritated China, its closest ally and biggest aid donor. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, today said China, which said it was &quot;resolutely opposed&quot; to last week&apos;s nuclear test, had ceased government exchanges with the North in protest. If the unconfirmed reports are true, it would be the clearest sign yet of China&apos;s displeasure with its unruly ally. China accounts for three-quarters of North Korea&apos;s foreign trade and supplies the vast majority of its oil and consumer goods. A second Taepodong launch in two months would pose a fresh challenge to the authority of the UN security council, which has yet to agree a united response to last week&apos;s controlled nuclear blast and the test launch of six-short range missiles. The international response will be further complicated by the appearance of two American journalists in a North Korean court this week, accused of spying on the country while making a documentary about refugees fleeing across its northern border to China. Laura Ling and Euna Lee, reporters for the San Francisco-based Current TV, will stand trial on Thursday and face being sent to a labour camp if found guilty of &quot;engaging in hostile acts&quot;. Gates warned over the weekend that Washington would never accept a nuclear North Korea. &quot;We will not stand idly by as North Korea builds the capability to wreak destruction on any target in the region or on us \u2026 we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state,&quot; he said at a meeting of defence officials in Singapore. South Korea, meanwhile, said today it would not tolerate military threats from its neighbour, days after Pyongyang said it no longer recognised the truce that ended the Korea war in 1953 and would attack the south if it joined in US-led inspections of ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction. &quot;If North Korea turns its back on dialogue and peace and dares carry out military threats and provocations, the Republic of Korea will never tolerate that,&quot; Lee said in a radio address. &quot;I want to make clear that there won&apos;t be any compromise on matters that affect our national security.&quot; North Korea has made good on threats to test rockets and nuclear weapons, as well as abandon six-party nuclear talks, unless the security council apologises for condemning the last long-rage missile test. The North insisted, to universal disbelief, that the exercise was designed to put a communications satellite into orbit."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/01/oil-currencies-sterling-gains", "sentences": ["All that is being translated into the idea that the worst of the recession is behind us.&quot; Victor Shum, an energy \u00adanalyst at the \u00adconsultancy Purvin &amp; Gertz in Singapore, said: &quot;The market has focused on the few nuggets of positive data and ignored the supply and demand fundamentals.&quot; The AA warned there could be another summer of &quot;petrol madness&quot; ahead."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-01T20:17:57Z", "title": "Oil price surges on booming stockmarkets", "tags": ["Oil", "Currencies", "Global recession", "Global economy", "World news", "Business"], "article": "Oil prices hit their highest level so far this year yesterday, while the pound regained its best level of 2009 against the euro on continued bullish sentiment that Britain may pull out of recession ahead of its European neighbours. The price of oil leapt through $68 (\u00a341) for a barrel of US light crude, a rise of $1.77 on the day, while Brent crude rose $1.94 to $67.46. Oil prices have nearly doubled from their low of less than $35 a barrel in February, although remain well below the all-time high of nearly $150 a barrel last summer. Oil prices soared 30% in May \u2013 the biggest monthly gain since 1999. However, global oil demand remains weak because of the biggest global recession in decades and US stocks are near 19-year highs. Analysts said the price was boosted by better news on factory output around the world, booming stockmarkets, and weakness in the dollar, in which oil is priced. Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures, said: &quot;Stockmarkets are rallying on improved global factory activity. The dollar is at another five-month low.

The dollar, meanwhile, fell sharply to its lowest level this year against a number of currencies, including sterling and the euro, as optimism that the global economy is on the road to recovery continued to boost riskier assets, reversing the flight into dollars that occurred during the worst of the financial system meltdown last autumn. &quot;This is a market in the process of selling the dollar against everything, buying commodities,&quot; said Brian Dolan, chief \u00adcurrency strategist at Forex.com, in New Jersey. &quot;The move has taken on something of a self-fulfilling quality to it now.&quot; The euro gained its highest level against the dollar so far this year of $1.418, while the pound gained to $1.644, its highest for seven months, and up sharply from the $1.37 low hit on 10 March. In good news for Britons planning holidays on the continent this summer, the pound also rose to within a whisker of \u20ac1.16, well above the near-parity it hit three months ago. Stockmarkets around the world shrugged off the bankruptcy of General Motors and the FTSE closed up 2%, or 88 points, at 4,506. As it did so, the Dow Jones in New York was up 2.6% at 8,718. Mining stocks led the charge in London, as metals prices firmed, helped by the improving manufacturing data, which came out of China early yesterday. China is usually the biggest global importer of metals, which it turns into manufactured goods to send to the west and Japan. David Buik, senior partner at BGC Partners in London, said: &quot;Any positive economic data that comes out of China has to be very, very positive.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jun/01/danny-la-rue-obituary", "sentences": ["John Gielgud saw it in Singapore and told La Rue that he should take his ability to make people laugh more seriously."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-01T23:01:00Z", "title": "Obituary: Danny La Rue", "tags": ["Danny La Rue", "Theatre", "Stage", "UK news", "Culture"], "article": "Danny La Rue, who has died aged 81, flouted the usual showbusiness rule that, to be funny, every female impersonator needed to have an obvious suggestion of \u2013hobnailed boots beneath a long frock. In a variation on this tradition, he appeared attired in sequinned dresses, but immediately said &quot;wotcher, mates!&quot; in a gruff voice. Yet what La Rue achieved was to replace a traditionally derisive mocking of women, that showed them as faintly grotesque, with glitter and elegance. He did it to such an extent that, apart from his height of over 6ft, he might easily have been a beautiful woman trying her luck with saucy jokes and sentimental songs. He became the first performer for many years to base his entire career on impersonating women. &quot;Vulgar, yes, but there is nothing crude about me,&quot; was his guiding maxim, as he flounced around variety stages, clubs, pierheads and pantomimes, doing a dozen changes a show, sometimes with stylish but over-the-top dresses which cost \u00a35,000 each. At his peak, in the 1970s, he was earning the equivalent of \u00a32m a year, and had four homes, a Rolls-Royce and an entourage of 60. La Rue was never a gay icon, nor a butt of the feminist movement, which sometimes surprised him. His core audience was, in fact, blue-rinsed ladies of a certain age who sent gushing letters congratulating him on his awards: showbusiness personality of the year in 1969, theatre personality of the year in 1970, 25 years in show business award in 1976 and entertainer of the decade in 1979.  They wrote saying how much they admired his legs or his self-manufactured rubber bosom, presumably because they identified with him and were comfortable with his act \u2013 though it sometimes included raucous jokes which, coming from anyone else, might have caused deep offence. He got away with it, he claimed, because everyone knew that everything he did and said was just a pretence: he regarded himself as an actor. Although Paul Scofield tried to \u2013persuade him to act in &quot;legitimate&quot; \u2013theatre, and Laurence Olivier wanted him to play Lady Macbeth, La Rue did not risk trying to escape his limitations. He would explain that taking off \u2013Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Bette Davis and Joan Collins, or Sophie Tucker singing My Yiddisher Mama, was acting enough. As a cabaret perfomer, he could be decidedly risqu\u00e9, earning himself the nicknames Danny La Rude and Danny La Blue. Offstage, he could also be reckless and get away with it. Once, he was appearing at a London club and in a \u2013Coventry pantomime simultaneously. At the same time, the royal family were asking for an increase in the civil list. When the Duke of Edinburgh, visiting La Rue&apos;s show, asked him if he was doing it for the cash, La Rue replied that it seemed to be all the fashion. A Guardian critic said in the 1960s that La Rue&apos;s material was &quot;dirty night-club jokes for drunks and bored people and other actors, and yet it is truly cleansing and cathartic&quot;. To which a reader from Hampstead \u2013 not usually regarded as the centre of La Rue&apos;s core audience \u2013 inquired acidly whether the critic was &quot;going through a period of severe mental strain&quot;. The reader \u2013obviously regarded La Rue&apos;s material as neither filthy nor psychologically significant, just funny. This was the received opinion throughout a long career which, he said, was sustained by discipline and application.  Born Daniel Patrick Carroll in Cork, Ireland, La Rue was the youngest son of a Roman Catholic cabinet-maker, who had five children. La Rue never knew him. His father went to New York in the 1920s with the idea of bringing his family over later, but died before this could happen. Danny was then 18 months old. His mother, whom he described as his life&apos;s inspiration, decided to compromise by seeking the family&apos;s fortunes in England. She lived in Soho, central London, struggling on her widow&apos;s pension and wages as a seamstress to provide for the large family, while young Danny attended schools in London and then, evacuated from London during the blitz, in Exeter. One day he found his mother in tears because she didn&apos;t know where the money for his new school uniform was going to come from. On leaving school, he earned \u00a31.50 a week in a \u2013bakery; wartime rationing was in place and he was allowed to take cakes home as a perk. He got a job in Exeter as a window-dresser, then moved back to London, doing the same job for an Oxford Street store. Called up for the Royal Navy, he made his first stage appearance, aged 18, as a native girl in a comic send-up of the serious play White Cargo. John Gielgud saw it in Singapore and told La Rue that he should take his ability to make people laugh more seriously. Once he left the navy, he did so. An old naval friend told him about auditions for an all-male chorus in the show Forces Showboat. Harry Secombe was in the same show. Forces Showboat went on tour for months, but La Rue saw little point in dressing up as a woman in the \u2013provinces. It didn&apos;t seem to be getting him anywhere, so he returned to the Oxford Street store and initiated lunch-time fashion shows. Then the promoter Ted Gatty persuaded him to do a West End revue in drag. He would do it, said La Rue, as long as it were not under his real name. When he arrived for rehearsals he found that Gatty had already given him the name Danny La Rue. The producer Cecil Landau saw the show and got La Rue a two-week slot at Churchill&apos;s club in Mayfair, which turned into a three-year engagement as top of the bill. La Rue spent the 1950s appearing on stage, often in \u2013pantomimes staged by the impresario Tom Arnold. He also appeared in cabaret in clubs with such success that, in the early 1960s, he opened Danny&apos;s, his own club in Hanover Square, which lasted nine years. This was in contrast to a later business venture, in the 1970s: restoring the derelict stately home Walton Hall near Stratford-upon-Avon, which he had bought for \u00a3500,000 \u2013 much of his considerable savings. He poured the rest into restoration and turning it into a hotel and arts centre, only to find that the two Canadian managers were conmen who had left him with a pile of unpaid bills, for which La Rue was legally responsible. The day after his 56th birthday, La Rue&apos;s company went into voluntary liquidation and he was forced to sell his home in Henley to pay off the debt. It got worse. In 1984 he took the lead in Hello, Dolly! which was critically panned and closed soon after. Later that year, his manager of 30 years, Jack Hanson, whom he described as &quot;the love of my life&quot;, died of a stroke. La Rue drank himself to sleep every night until a \u2013psychic told him that his pet dog was the reincarnation of Hanson. Taking \u2013further comfort from his Catholic religion \u2013 he kept a little shrine by his \u2013bedside \u2013 La Rue resumed his disciplined routine of personal appearances at pierheads and in pantomime, rationing his television appearances as always. Why, he asked, should people pay to see him on stage when they could see him for free on TV?  He never married and was angry at those who called his announced, but later called-off, engagement to an American millionairess in 1987 a publicity stunt. In 2000, his companion Wayne King, an Australian pianist, died aged 46, of Aids. Two years later, in recognition of the thousands of pounds he raised for Aids charities, La Rue was appointed OBE (the Queen was said to be a great admirer of his act). Suffering from the eye condition macular degeneration, in 2006 he also suffered a stroke, though even then his agent said that La Rue was &quot;dying to get his old frocks out, dust them off and get back in the limelight&quot;. Shortly afterwards, in poor health and receiving financialassistance from an actors&apos; charity, he moved in to the home of his former dresser and longtime friend Annie Galbraith, who cared for him until his death.  \u2022 Danny La Rue (Daniel Patrick Carroll), female impersonator and actor, born 26 July 1927; died 31 May 2009 \u2022 This is an updated version of the obituary that first appeared on theguardian.com on Tuesday 2 June.

Jorge Amaral, a Brazilian air force spokesman, said the seats were seen early this morning, but added that the authorities could not immediately confirm whether they were from the missing Airbus A330. Small white pieces of debris, material that could be metallic and signs of oil and kerosene, which is used as jet fuel, were also seen. There were no signs of life in the two areas, about 35 miles apart, where debris was sighted. &quot;The locations where the objects were found are towards the right of the point where the last signal of the plane was emitted,&quot; Amaral said. &quot;That suggests that it might have tried to make a turn, maybe to return to Fernando de Noronha, but that is just a hypothesis.&quot; He added that authorities would not be able to confirm whether the debris was from the plane until they retrieved some of it. Brazilian military ships are not expected to arrive at the area until tomorrow. The debris was found about 375 miles north-east of the Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha. French officials said bad weather made the search difficult, with heavy clouds forcing planes to fly very low over the water and limiting their line of sight. As the search for wreckage continued, a minute&apos;s silence was observed at the French Open tennis tournament in Paris. The Russian world number one, Dinara Safina, and the Belarussian, Victoria Azarenka, were among those who stood with their heads bowed before their quarter-final match at Roland Garros. A minute&apos;s silence will be observed at France&apos;s friendly football match against Nigeria today, when the French players will wear black armbands. The first commercial flight of the Airbus A380 superjumbo from Paris leaves today from Charles de Gaulle for Singapore Airlines, but the party originally planned has been cancelled. A service for the families of the passengers will be held at Notre Dame tomorrow. Earlier, the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, told France Info radio it was &quot;a race against time&quot; to find the wreckage of flight 447. Borloo said the plane&apos;s black box would emit information for only 30 days and needed to be found as soon as possible. He warned that the search operation would be extremely difficult because of the depth of the water and the strong currents. Search and rescue efforts have also been complicated by uncertainty about the precise time the jet went down. The Airbus had been travelling from Brazil to Paris and ran into treacherous weather off Brazil shortly before it disappeared from radar screens. Borloo said that when a passenger jet crashed into the Red Sea after leaving the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in 2004, the crash area was identified but it took 15 days to find the black box. He added that there had definitely been extreme weather conditions between Brazil and France, but said this could not completely explain the crash. The French minister for transport, Dominique Bussereau, warned that the investigation could be lengthy, saying: &quot;It could be a few days, a few weeks or a few months.&quot; Air France is considered to be one of the world&apos;s safest airlines and the A330 one of the most secure passenger jets. The airline said the 12-member crew, including a 58-year-old pilot who had worked for it since 1988, was highly experienced. The two co-pilots were 37 and 32. The families of passengers stayed the night in hotels at Charles de Gaulle airport, paid for by Air France. Borloo said that relatives could eventually go to the crash zone if they wanted to. Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, will invite the families of the passengers to the Elys\u00e9e palace on Monday. In Le Parisien newspaper Michel Pieraerts described how his sister, a 29-year-old engineer for Michelin, had been on the flight. She had gone to Brazil on a 10-day holiday with her boyfriend, who is on a work trip to the country. He was due to return to France in a few weeks, so she flew back alone. &quot;My mother heard the news on the radio. She knew my sister was on that flight,&quot; he said. &quot;People are talking about a crisis support centre at the airport, but not for people who aren&apos;t at Charles de Gaulle. I&apos;d like a doctor to at least talk to my parents by phone.&quot; Flight 447 ploughed into thunderstorms and heavy turbulence four hours into its overnight flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Fifteen minutes later the aircraft reported electrical faults through an automated message. Then contact was lost. Fran\u00e7ois Brousse, an Air France spokesman, said several of the plane&apos;s mechanisms had malfunctioned, preventing it from making contact with air traffic controllers. One theory was that it could have been struck by lightning. If there are no survivors it would be the world&apos;s worst aviation disaster since 2001, and the deadliest in Air France&apos;s 75-year history. Passengers on the aircraft included 61 French citizens and 58 Brazilians, as well as 26 Germans and at least a dozen other nationalities. The 12 crew members were French. Seven children and a baby were aboard. The passengers included three young women from Ireland who were embarking on careers as doctors, and were returning home after a holiday in Brazil with other friends who had graduated with them from Trinity College, Dublin. Their party also included a woman from Wales. Three of the women were named locally last night as Aisling Butler, of Roscrea, Co Tipperary, Jane Deasy, of Dublin, and Eithne Walls, of Belfast.. Patricia Coakley, from Whitby, North Yorkshire, said she believed her husband, Arthur, had been on the flight after finishing a four-week stint working on an oil rig in Brazil. &quot;He was very excited about seeing his children and going on holiday to Corfu on Friday,&quot; she told Sky News. &quot;My only hope is I keep phoning his mobile \u2026 it rings, so it can&apos;t be at the bottom of the sea. &quot;I have three distraught children \u2026 we hope daddy will be coming home soon.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/02/france-plane-crash-airbus-system", "sentences": ["He added: &quot;The indications from the aircraft&apos;s datalink system are that there was a loss of electrical systems in a very short space of time, which indicates that there was a catastrophic failure.&quot; Morris said concerns remained that the full cause of the incident in Australia, on a flight from Singapore to Perth, had not been found."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-02T22:32:00Z", "title": "Air France plane crash: race to find black box after debris spotted", "tags": ["Plane crashes", "France", "Brazil", "World news", "Air transport", "Europe", "Americas"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 8 June 2009 In the article below we said that the A330&apos;s &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; system used an air data computer to guide the aircraft. This function is actually performed by the primary flight control (PFC) computers, which draw not only on the air data - altitude, air speed, and so forth - but also on information from a range of other systems. Brazilian military planes scouring the equatorial Atlantic today found a three mile path of wreckage in the \u00adAtlantic Ocean confirming that the missing Air France jet carrying 228 people crashed in the sea, the defence minister, Nelson Jobim, said tonight . He said the discovery &quot;confirms that the plane went down in that area,&quot; hundreds of miles from the Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha. The announcement came as questions emerged about the track record of the type of aircraft, an Airbus A330, involved. &quot;There isn&apos;t the slightest doubt that the debris is from the Air France plane,&quot; Jobim said. He said the strip of wreckage included metallic and nonmetallic pieces, but he did not describe them in detail. No bodies were spotted in the crash of the \u00adAirbus A330 in which all aboard are believed to have died. Earlier in the day air force pilots saw white metallic objects, an aeroplane seat, an orange buoy and jet fuel stains in the water roughly 400 miles north of the archipelago in two areas around 35 miles apart, but there were no signs of life. Two commercial ships reached the site to assist in the search and French naval vessels were on their way last night. The French military said no \u00adconfirmation of the plane&apos;s wreckage could be made until debris was recovered and serial numbers assessed. Air France flight 447 from Rio to Paris, carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew, mysteriously disappeared early yesterday in heavy weather without sending any distress signal, four hours after taking off from Rio. Air France announced a &quot;catastrophe&quot;, saying the plane could have been hit by lightning. But French ministers yesterday said lightning alone did not explain the crash, which would be the worst air disaster in Air France&apos;s 75-year history. &quot;All scenarios have to be envisaged,&quot; the French defence minister, Herv\u00e9 Morin, said yesterday. &quot;We can&apos;t rule out a \u00adterrorist act since terrorism is the main threat to \u00adwestern democracies, but at this time we don&apos;t have any element whatsoever indicating that such an act could have caused this accident.&quot; The environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, today described &quot;a race against time&quot; to find the wreckage and the plane&apos;s black box flight recorder, without which the crash remained &quot;incomprehensible&quot;. He warned that the black box would only emit signals for 30 days. But the Atlantic search area between the coasts of Brazil and Africa remains vast and depths range from 3,000 to 6,000 metres, with currents so strong that the box might never be found. Borloo said that in 2004, when a jet crashed off Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, even with an exact crash point located, it took 15 days to find the flight recorder at a depth of 1,000 metres. In the case of the Air France flight, the ocean search area is much wider, there is no exact location and depths are \u00adestimated to be at least 4,000 metres. The jet sent an automatic message reporting lost pressure and electrical faults before it went missing. But the \u00admystery persisted tonight as to how a modern plane operated by three experienced pilots could have crashed. A law firm representing victims of a previous serious incident involving an Airbus A330 warned that the aircraft could be vulnerable to electrical interference. London-based Stewarts Law is preparing to sue Airbus, the Australian airline Qantas and a computer manufacturer, on behalf of 30 people injured when an A330 suddenly plunged 650 feet in flight last October. Air accident investigators blamed the rapid descent at 37,000ft over Western Australia on a malfunctioning computer system. The A330 is a &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; aeroplane that uses an air data computer to guide the aircraft and, if necessary, amend pilot errors. The A330 has flown 707 million passengers since its launch 15 years ago and this week&apos;s crash was its first fatal incident in active service. But in the Qantas case, the aircraft&apos;s main navigational tool, the air data inertial reference unit, started emitting &quot;electronic spikes&quot; and plunged the A330 into a dive after mistakenly calculating that the aircraft was pitching its nose into the air. In fact, the aircraft was flying level. According to one theory being examined by lawyers, the Airbus computer systems could have been affected by inadvertent interference from a nearby naval communications station. Jim Morris, a senior associate at Stewarts Law, said the Air France crash had again raised fears about the aircraft&apos;s susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. &quot;It could be that if the A330 is more vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, it could have caused the pilots to lose control of the aircraft during severe turbulence,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;The indications from the aircraft&apos;s datalink system are that there was a loss of electrical systems in a very short space of time, which indicates that there was a catastrophic failure.&quot; Morris said concerns remained that the full cause of the incident in Australia, on a flight from Singapore to Perth, had not been found. &quot;They still do not know what went wrong with this unit. It might not be as resilient to electromagnetic interference as it should be.&quot; An Airbus spokesman said: &quot;An investigation has just started and it is premature to add to any speculation. We are supporting the investigation. &quot;There is no information to infer that there is any similarity between what happened in Australia and this case. The A330 has an extremely good safety record and this is the first accident on a commercially operated A330.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2009/jun/03/2", "sentences": ["Barclays has fallen 11.25p to 262.25p on talk that Singapore&apos;s Temasek had followed the Abu Dhabi example and disposed of its shareholding."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-03T13:56:22Z", "title": "Wall Street adds to FTSE woes after jobs figures", "tags": ["Business", "Vodafone", "National Grid", "Barclays", "HSBC", "Vedanta Resources", "Xstrata"], "article": "An opening fall on Wall Street after disappointing US job figures has added to the downbeat mood in London, where leading shares continue to show sharp declines.

A series of disappointing US figures did much of the damage, with more than half a million private sector jobs lost in May, a fall in mortgage applications last week and a sharper than expected contraction in the US service sector. All eyes will now be on the key US non-farm payroll figures due on Friday. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said:  &quot;The [service sector] index for May might be giving some of the first clues that the V-shaped recovery hypothesis is flawed. Expectations for a rise in the index to 45.0 were optimistic, and the survey registered a mere 0.3 point increase to 44.0. This is still consistent with economic stagnation.&quot;  A better than expected UK service sector survey had little chance of withstanding this wave of negative news from across the Atlantic, while fairly positive comments from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke at a budget committee hearing also failed to make much of an impact. So with Wall Street nearly 80 points lower by the time London closed, the FTSE 100 finished down 93.60 points at 4383.42, not helped by the growing political crisis engulfing the Labour government. Among the miners, Vedanta Resources lost 137p to \u00a315.82, Xstrata fell 50p to 728p and Anglo American fell 113p to \u00a317.85. The sector had already been weak ahead of the US data following downbeat comments from China about the pace of recovery in the country. Rio Tinto lost 141p to \u00a329.12 as rights issue rumours resurfaced. Merrill Lynch, in a positve note on the miner, said:  &quot;We see the potential for material changes to the proposed Chinalco deal and/or a small rights issue as an alternative, both of which we believe would be received positively by the market.&quot;  Bank shares were under pressure on concerns that UK institutions might need to follow their US counterparts and raise yet more funds, and on fears of further stake sales. HSBC fell 5.5p to 529.5p despite the troubled Saudi group Saad seemingly denying earlier speculation it was selling its near 3% stake. Barclays dropped 13.75p to 259.75p on talk that Singapore&apos;s Temasek had followed the Abu Dhabi example and disposed of its shareholding - with a loss of \u00a3800m. But another Barclays&apos; investor, Qatar Holding, said it remained a supportive shareholder in the bank. The leading index was also weakened by a number of major companies going ex-dividend. These included Vodafone, which fell 5.8p to 113p and alone accounted for 12 points of the FTSE&apos;s fall. Others where the shares lost the right to a payout included International Power, 18.75p lower at 255.5p, and National Grid, off 39p to 561p. But elsewhere in the power sector Drax added 5.25p to 485.25p as Morgan Stanley upgraded the coal fired power station owner from underweight to equal-weight and raised its price target from 475p to 545p. The bank said:  &quot;The risk-reward profile for the stock has improved, in our view, but is not yet compelling in a sector context \u2013our preferred name for a play on UK power is International Power. Biomass investment could be a positive, but it is too early to be sure. In our bull case (805p) three dedicated biomass plants could be worth up to 100p of value. However, the valuation spread is wide, and uncertainties remain. S&amp;P recently downgraded Drax&apos;s corporate credit rating to BBB- and has the rating on negative outlook. But given our earnings forecast increases, we see risk to a further downgrade as low.&quot;  Several other businesses benefited from positive analyst coverage. Medical devices group Smith and Nephew rose 9.75p to 475p as Goldman Sachs issued a buy note and raised its target price from 590p to 610p. A positive note on the food retail sector from Cazenove lifted Morrisons 3.5p to 247.5p ahead of a trading update tomorrow, while Tesco added 0.9p to 353.3p and J Sainsbury 2.25p to 316.5p. Tobacco companies benefited from Citigroup comments on the sector, with British American Tobacco up 1p to \u00a316.87 and Imperial Tobacco 15p better at \u00a316. BAE Systems climbed 5.5p to 338p after Cazenove repeated its outperform rating on the company. The broker said it was surprised BAE had missed out on the recent market rally, and believed the shares were materially undervalued. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey was boosted by 2.25p to 36p after Collins Stewart upgraded from hold to buy, but the same broker advised taking profits in Tullow Oil, down 31.5p to 990.5p. Tullow&apos;s partner in Uganda, Heritage Oil, was suspended at 585p, up 55p, after it revealed it was in talks about a possible merger, which would effectively be a reverse takeover of the business. Traders have previously pointed to the Chinese state oil companies as possible bidders. Meanwhile Lloyds of London insurer Amlin added 2.5p to 341.5p as it placed 23.5m shares at 325p each to help fund the \u00a3300m purchase of Fortis Corporate Insurance from the Dutch government. In a hold note analyst Tom Dorner at Oriel Securities commented:  &quot;The acquisition is expected to be earnings and return on equity enhancing in 2009. FCI was loss making in 2008 so a key question will be whether Amlin are able to turn around FCI&apos;s operations.&quot;  But JP Morgan was less positive, saying the deal looked expensive and adding:  &quot;Amlin say that sharing Amlin&apos;s underwriting skills and risk management will improve FCI&apos;s ability, however this could also prove to be a management distraction and could reduce the quality of existing business which attracts a premium rating to the sector.&quot;  Holiday group Thomas Cook reversed earlier gains to close 4.25p lower at 225.75p on continuing concerns about the financial state of its 52% shareholder Arcandor, which is seeking state aid to keep it going. The European Commission seemed to pour cold water on this idea by saying Arcandor would be unlikely to qualify. At the same time refinancing talks among Arcandor&apos;s banks were said to have stalled after disagreements over extending a credit line due to run out in a matter of days. Investors are concerned about the fate of Arcandor&apos;s stake in Thomas Cook, which overshadowed positive notes from Panmure Gordon and Credit Suisse following a meeting with the Thomas Cook management last night. Finally Debenhams dipped 1.25p to 92.25p on talk of an imminent cash call to raise perhaps \u00a3300m."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/03/new-look-increase-profits", "sentences": ["McPhail said he was also close to signing deals to open stores in Poland and Ukraine and that new distribution hubs in Singapore and Turkey, due to open this year, would eventually allow the chain to open stores in India and China."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-03T18:45:22Z", "title": "New Look bucks recession with 10% rise in profits", "tags": ["New Look", "Retail industry", "Consumer spending", "Business", "UK news", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "article": "Cheap chic fashion chain New Look has bucked the recession and revealed a 10% leap in annual profits. The chain \u2013 owned by founder Tom Singh, the chain&apos;s top management, and by private equity groups Permira and Apax Partners \u2013 claims it is winning customers from larger rivals Marks &amp; Spencer and Next as shoppers search out the best\u00a0prices. Chief executive Carl McPhail said: &quot;We&apos;re still 20-30% cheaper than the mid-market \u2013 the likes of Next and M&amp;S \u2013 on an average basket. That is very appealing to some of their customers.&quot; New Look claims 37% of British women bought an item at one of its stores last year and says its website is now attracting 1m visitors a week. McPhail added sales growth had moved up a gear in recent weeks, boosted by strong demand for warmer weather fashions, especially gladiator sandals and summer dresses. The chain sold 1.3m pairs of leggings last year, and 15m pairs of shoes. It now sells more women&apos;s footwear than any other UK retailer and is also market leader in denim. The group is now focused on international expansion, first in Europe and later, possibly, in India and China. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 10% to \u00a3218m in the year to the end of March. McPhail said the chain had been helped by its decision not to cut prices before Christmas, unlike &quot;more distressed competitiors&quot;. Total sales were up 15% to \u00a31.3bn. Excluding gains from new shop space, sales were ahead 1.4%. That increase contrasts sharply with the 6.9% decline in like-for-like sales of general merchandise recently reported by Marks and Spencer over the same 12 month period. New Look&apos;s private equity backers, who backed a \u00a3700m buyout of the business in 2004, attempted to sell it for \u00a32bn two years ago, but would-be bidders baulked at the price tag. Sale hopes were then stymied by the credit crunch. New Look said it expected another challenging year for consumers worried about rising unemployment and sliding house prices. Those comments echoed similar warnings from Ian Cheshire, chief executive of B&amp;Q group Kingfisher on Tuesday. He was also posting higher profits, but insisted there was no sign yet of green shoots and warned higher unemployment in the coming months posed a big threat. The group said it planned to open 23 stores in France and Belgium in the coming year, together with more franchised outlets in the Middle East and Russia. McPhail said he was also close to signing deals to open stores in Poland and Ukraine and that new distribution hubs in Singapore and Turkey, due to open this year, would eventually allow the chain to open stores in India and China. New Look has 612 stores in Britain and Ireland and opened 33 new outlets last year. It is planning to move its head office from Weymouth to London later this year to &quot;gain increased access to the available talent pool that London offers&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/03/barclay", "sentences": ["The sale follows reports that Singapore state investor Temasek sold its stake Barclays several months ago at a big loss."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-03T19:18:53Z", "title": "Manchester City owner takes advantage of fivefold increase in stock to further boost Monday's \u00a31.4bn profit", "tags": ["Barclays", "Business"], "article": "Middle eastern investors in Barclays who made a \u00a31.4bn profit on the sale of shares on Monday, added to their winnings today with a further \u00a31.25bn sale of the bank&apos;s shares.

The Abu Dhabi based investor took advantage of a fivefold increase in the stock to sell at what insiders called &quot;a further significant profit&quot;. The sale follows reports that Singapore state investor Temasek sold its stake Barclays several months ago at a big loss. After spending more than \u00a31bn on shares in Britain&apos;s second-biggest bank in the last two years, unlisted Temasek may have lost over \u00a3800m on the investment. Paulson &amp; Co, the hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson, is also understood to have squandered more than \u00a3200m from profits short-selling Barclays stock after failing to close a short position in the bank. The Paulson fund, which made \u00a3606m in the past year betting that RBS and Lloyds would fall, has a short position of 1.17% in Barclays, according to regulatory filings. Paulson, who was one of the most aggressive short sellers of UK bank stocks after making hundreds of millions of pounds shorting US sub-prime mortgage lenders, would have made a profit of \u00a3319m had it sold the stock at its January low, compared to \u00a3101m last week.

British Airways, Ireland&apos;s Aer Lingus and Singapore Airlines are among the carriers to have reported a drop in financial performances so far this year, with 50 airlines reporting total first quarter net losses of $3.3bn. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) added its financial forecast for the industry was &quot;significantly more pessimistic&quot; than recent estimates of a $4.7bn deficit in 2009. Giovanni Bisignani, Iata chief executive, said he would predict wider losses when airline chiefs gather at the annual industry summit in Kuala Lumpur next week. The gloomy outlook echoes recent comments by the British Airways chief executive, Willie Walsh, who said he saw &quot;no green shoots&quot; after his airline reported a record loss of \u00a3401m last year. &quot;Since our last forecast in March, when we anticipated a $4.7bn loss in 2009, the industry situation has deteriorated,&quot; said Bisignani. The Iata chief said the decline in cargo traffic had remained around 20%, indicating a deep economic downturn that would depress passenger numbers for months to come. He added: &quot;We may have hit the bottom, but we don&apos;t yet see the signs of a recovery. On Monday we will present an outlook that is significantly more pessimistic.&quot; The heaviest first quarter losses were recorded by European carriers, which registered post-tax losses of $1.9bn, with North American airlines reporting losses of $592m. Big US airlines have survived the worst of the downturn because carriers such as United Airlines and US Airways had previously cleaned up their balance sheets by filing for bankruptcy protection. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, was reported today to have asked Boeing and Airbus to put forward competing bids for 150 aircraft, in a rare show of confidence by an established airline. Iata also warned that fuel costs, which forced more than 30 airlines into bankruptcy last year, were regaining upward momentum and threatening to compound losses due to weak ticket sales. It warned that crude oil prices were up by $15, to $55 a barrel so far this year. &quot;Markets are anticipating an economic recovery and rising futures markets have been pulling spot prices higher,&quot; said Iata in its monthly financial monitor. Fuel accounted for 45% of Ryanair&apos;s operating costs last year and is expected to take up a third of BA&apos;s budget in 2009. Last year, the spike in oil prices brought grim warnings of mass bankruptcies from airline bosses and pushed the industry into an estimated loss of $8.5bn. No big airlines folded, but the collapse of Silverjet in Britain, Zoom and XL Airways stranded thousands of passengers and prompted consolidation between large carriers, such as BA and Iberia in Spain. The most optimistic outlook has come from budget airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet, which have boasted that demand is holding up even though the industry as a whole has seen traffic fall 7.5% in the year to date. Ryanair reported its first annual loss in 20 years this week due to the plummeting value of its investment in Aer Lingus, but its underlying business remains profitable. Michael O&apos;Leary, Ryanair&apos;s chief executive, said rival airlines face a &quot;bloodbath&quot; this winter as his airline prepares to cut fares by 20% to fill its planes. Airlines are now considering whether to follow Ryanair&apos;s lead and expand into the recession. BA has refused to issue guidance for the current financial year as it wrestles with forecasts, while easyJet&apos;s biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-\u00adIoannou, is embroiled in a boardroom battle over a growth strategy he believes is too ambitious. Cuts in capacity have slowed but the number of seats available worldwide is still falling, with a 2.5% decline in April. The gloomy prognosis from Iata will further complicate airlines&apos; strategic planning as they weigh up signs of economic recovery in some markets, with the threat of heavier losses if they overestimate a hoped-for recovery in demand."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/04/china-singapore-tianjin-eco-city", "sentences": ["China and Singapore are pooling expertise and finance to build a green urban community in north-east China, with the capacity for 350,000 people, near the western shore of the Bohai, one of the most polluted seas in the world."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-04T20:23:05Z", "title": "China teams up with Singapore to build huge eco city", "tags": ["China", "Singapore", "Ecotowns", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Recycling", "Environment", "World news", "Green building", "Asia Pacific", "Cities"], "article": "The buildings will be the latest word in energy efficiency: 60% of all waste will be recycled, and the settlement will be laid out in such a way as to encourage walking and discourage driving. But this is not the latest experiment in European green living. This is a ground-breaking mega development in China that could serve as a model for eco cities across the developing world, say to its backers. China and Singapore are pooling expertise and finance to build a green urban community in north-east China, with the capacity for 350,000 people, near the western shore of the Bohai, one of the most polluted seas in the world. The plan to build this settlement, known as Tianjin Eco-City and likely to be the size of Bristol, is, though, haunted by the failure of a yet more ambitious scheme, near Shanghai. At a ceremony to mark the start of construction on the first phase of Tianjin \u2013 an &quot;eco-business park&quot; over 150 hectares (370 acres) \u2013 investors\u00a0said the 10-year scheme was intended to be &quot;scalable and replicable&quot; so it could be used across China, India and other developing nations. A new model is certainly needed. Over the next 20 years the number of urban dwellers in China is forecast to swell by more than 300 million, equivalent to the entire population of the US. With consumption levels and wages three times higher in the city than in the countryside, this will put an enormous strain on energy and water resources \u2013 unless there is a change in the urbanisation model. Prototype eco cities and villages are springing up in several areas in China, including\u00a0Xiangji town in Xinjiang, and Huangbaiyu in Liaoning. But finding the right balance between radical change and realism has proved elusive. The biggest disappointment has been the eco city plan for Dongtan, which the engineering consultants Arup\u00a0billed as a model for the world. Under a hugely ambitious scheme dreamed up by the British company, the silt flats north of Shanghai would have been home to a low-carbon, near car-free city the size of Manhattan. But just a year before the first phase was to have been completed, the site is moribund. The project&apos;s main political backer is in jail on corruption charges, construction permits have lapsed and prospects of the plan being realised look increasingly distant. Goh Chye Boon, chief of the joint venture running the business park at Tianjin Eco-City, said his project had learned from Dongtan that it was better not to reach immediately for the skies. &quot;We aspire to one day be a dream city like Dongtan but we want to take one credible step at a time,&quot; he said. &quot;Dongtan inspired me, but I think when you reach too high, you may forget that the ultimate beneficiary must be the resident.&quot; But the new city being built in Tianjin\u00a0is in danger of going too far the other way by not being ambitious enough. Although it will use wind and geothermal power, its target of 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020 is only a tiny improvement on the goal for the national average.\u00a0The goal for carbon emissions\u00a0is equally modest. Every building is to be insulated, double glazed and made entirely of materials that abide by the government&apos;s green standards. More than 60% of waste will be recycled. To cut car journeys by 90%, a light railway will pass close by every home, and zoning will ensure all residents have shops, schools and clinics within walking distance. It will be more verdant than almost any other city in China, with an average of 12sq\u00a0metres (nearly 130sq ft) of parks or lawns or wetlands for each person.\u00a0Domestic water use should be kept below 120\u00a0litres (26 gallons) per person each day,\u00a0 with more than half supplied by rain capture and recycled grey water. Success will depend on finding the right mixture of economics, user-friendliness and environmental concerns. Paul French, chief China analyst at Access Asia, said Dongtan had died because planners h ad failed to consult the local community and had aimed too high. &quot;Dongtan was plonked down on everyone. They were going to do everything,\u00a0but nothing has been realised. It&apos;s really important with environmental stuff that you only say what you can actually deliver or people will lose trust.&quot; Liang Benfan, a professor of urban development at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: &quot;It&apos;s good people are discussing this, but they are too focused on technology.

The panel included: \u2022 Simon Spanswick, Chief Executive, Association for International Broadcasting, London \u2022 Cristiana Falcone, Director Media and Entertainment Industries, World Economic Forum USA Inc.\u2022 Tim Weber, Business editor, BBC News - interactive + radio, UK\u2022 P N Balji, Director of the Asia Journalism Fellowship, Singapore\u2022 Nick Brambring, Vice President Advertising and Regional Manager CEE (Central and Eastern Europe), Zattoo, Switzerland\u2022 Salim Amin, Head of the pan-African media company A24 Media Nairobi/Kenya\u2022 Axel Schmiegelow, CEO, sevenload, Germany The moderator, Simon Spanswick, started the discussion with one of the more interesting facts I heard at the conference. There are more mobile handsets than television sets in the world. Tim Weber of the BBC thought the question of whether the internet was a friend or foe was a &quot;false conflict&quot;. The BBC was embracing new platforms because people weren&apos;t using its traditional linear platforms like they did in the past. He said:  They use the internet, mobile phones, social networks. We cannot sit back and wait for the audience to come to us. If we did not go into new media, there would be a guaranteed limited lifespan for what the BBC does.  The BBC can only justify the licence fee if they maintain a certain level of audience. New media allows the BBC to have reach where it didn&apos;t have in the past. He gave the example of the United States where previously the only audience was short-wave radio enthusiasts. Now the US accounts for a significant audience online for the BBC. One key thing to remember that trends in the US and Europe do not necessarily hold true in other parts of the world. PN Balji of Singapore said the use of traditional media there was still very high. He added:  The tsunami that is hitting the media in the US is still a way off for Singapore. They know that it is coming, but they do not know when.  Although broadband penetration is quite high in Singapore, the reach for new media is still not there. Furthermore, the media companies in Singapore are still quite cash-rich. They don&apos;t have a financial imperative to shift to new media, especially because they see that no one else has effectively monetised new media. Singaporean media companies will not go there without knowing where the money is. Chinese and Indian companies are in much the same position, Balji said. The profits of mainstream news companies is still strong, and broadband penetration is still not what it is in the other countries. Axel Schmiegelow, CEO of German video site Sevenload, said:  Up until now, new media has been very destructive. It takes eyeballs away from traditional without providing the revenue to support the traditional media companies or journalists. Revenue per user is much lower in new media than traditional media. But that does not have to be the case.  He said that Sevenload was making six figures in revenue per month. The site is niche TV, or put another way, &quot;channelised social media content&quot;. Users can also connect based on content they like. People are willing to pay for relevant, high quality content, and advertisers are willing to pay higher ad rates than even in traditional media because users are being shown highly targeted advertising. Another video model is that of Zattoo, which re-broadcasts television through its web service. Through geo-targeing, users are only able to see the content that Zattoo has a licence to show in a country. The site has four to 5m registered users with its home country of Switzerland having 1m. The service is ad supported, with users watching a short ad every time they switch between channels. Salim Amin, head of A24 media in Kenya, said that Africa&apos;s big advantage is that it tended to leapfrog technologies. The continent didn&apos;t have a developed landline phone infrastructure, which is why it went directly to mobile phone technology. In what was a comment made by several Africans at the forum, Amin said that two undersea fibre-optic cables could will revolutionise the contienent. His business appeals to advertisers who want a pan-African network, he said. But he has motivations beyond simply making money:  We have to change the image of the continent. It&apos;s not just war and famine and HIV, and we need to content to change that image.  Cristiana Falcone, of the World Economic Forum, went through the ways that the the forum had used new media in the last several years. They started with a podcast, which she admitted was basically an exercise in public relations. They then expanded their efforts to create the Davos conversation with the Huffington Post. Next, they invited Second Live to Davos. The Reuters Second Life reporter interviewed the forum&apos;s CEO in Second Life (even if the CEO didn&apos;t like his avatar). Last year, they branched out even further, using Flickr, Twitter and Facebook to host a distributed conversation. More than 6m people took part. Looking to Barack Obama&apos;s winning presidential campaign, she said that media companies needed to take &quot;a portfolio approach&quot; that mixed the best of the old and new. Spanswick pointed to how newspapers are getting into video, trying to build on their traditional businesses. What does this mean for broadcasters like the BBC? Weber saw two trends. He said:  If old media dies, it is because they cling to their distribution channel. They pray at the Church of the Dead Tree (a phrase he attributed to me).  That doesn&apos;t mean that a newspaper should necessarily go online only. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer recently shut down its print edition and cut the newsroom staff from 150 journalists to about 20. The site has very vibrant, blog and user-generated-content driven website, he said. But after they stopped the print edition, their website traffic fell. Media companies need to take their content and spread it across platforms to survive, he said. The other trend that he saw was that internet could make a jump from the study to the living room. Set-top boxes will become broadband-enabled. YouTube will make the jump to your regular television. The BBC now has some programmes that are watched more on its on-demand service, iPlayer, than through the traditional television.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, you&apos;re not competing with 500 channels but almost an endless number of channels. He said:  In the sea of digital choice, the one thing that will make you stand out is your brand. If you have a brand, then you will survive.  Fears for the future of newspapers Balji said:  The biggest destroyers of journalism are the journalists themselves.  Although the world has changed dramatically, if you look at the way that stories are written and the hierarchy is organised in most newspapers, it hasn&apos;t changed in 50 to 100 years. &quot;here is a lot of dinosaurs in our newsrooms.,&quot; he said. The challenges of today require a quantum leap in the business model, and he suggested that newspapers might shift to become non-profit organisations. A member of the audience expressed concern about whether online news could fill the gap if newspapers shut down. He said: &quot;I am concerned about death of the dinosaur. I worry that major money that big newspapers used to spend on investigative journalism. Who is going to do that online in the future?&quot; Falcone said that journalist remained very relevant. &quot;Someone still needs to contextualise events for a global audience,&quot; she said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jun/06/yayoi-kusama-art", "sentences": ["They appeared in her early paintings, on &quot;living&quot; installations comprising her own naked torso and those of her friends, and, more recently, wrapped around tree trunks in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-05T23:01:00Z", "title": "Justin McCurry talks to artist Yayoi Kusama", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Yayoi Kusama"], "article": "Yayoi Kusama has created an estimated 50,000 works during a career spanning half a century, is feted in her native Japan and in the US - yet in Britain she remains relatively unknown. Kusama turned 80 in March, but when we meet at her Tokyo studio, she is a vision in a bobbed, blood-red wig and a red one-piece dress covered in her beloved polka dots.  It is impossible to discuss Kusama&apos;s work without making mention of those dots and the omnipresent lined meshed patterns she calls &quot;infinity nets&quot;. They appeared in her early paintings, on &quot;living&quot; installations comprising her own naked torso and those of her friends, and, more recently, wrapped around tree trunks in Singapore. Later this month, trees along the Thames will also be given the polka-dot treatment, as part of a collaborative exhibition with nine other artists at London&apos;s Hayward Gallery.  The motifs first came to Kusama in childhood. Born in 1929 in Matsumoto in the Japanese Alps, she started seeing a psychiatrist at the age of 10 after she became gripped by visions of dots, nets and violet flowers that covered everything she saw. &quot;I call them my repetitive vision,&quot; she says. &quot;I still see them. [They] cover the canvas and grow on to the floor, the ceiling, chairs and tables. Then the polka dots move to the body, on to my clothes and into my spirit. It is an obsession.&quot; Hers was an unhappy childhood. &quot;Not a single day went by that my mother didn&apos;t regret giving birth to me,&quot; she says. &quot;She was the only daughter of a wealthy family, so my father, as the son-in-law, was able to lead an extravagant lifestyle. He ended up having an affair with a geisha and deserted us to be with her in Tokyo. It damaged my mother. I was stuck in the middle of a long-running feud and I felt mentally cornered. That&apos;s why I started hallucinating. I started seeing a psychiatrist, and it was he who first encouraged me to develop as an artist.&quot; She studied, against her mother&apos;s wishes, at the Kyoto Municipal School of Arts and Crafts, and by 1950 had moved from traditional Japanese painting to abstract natural forms. In her most fevered periods, in her 20s, she was producing dozens of paintings a day, leading to more conflict at home. &quot;My mother was strongly opposed to my becoming an artist. She was from a very old, conservative family. She was a collector of art and desperately wanted me to become one, too. Whenever I drew or made sculptures, she would fly into a rage and throw paints and canvases at me.&quot;  Eventually, in 1957, Kusama left Japan for New York, following a lengthy correspondence with the American artist Georgia O&apos;Keeffe. &quot;I had been a great admirer after coming across her work in an old book I found in a store in my home town. Her works are wonderful, moving. I spent six hours travelling to Tokyo so I could find her address in Who&apos;s Who at the US embassy. Amazingly, she wrote back, and we kept writing to each other.&quot; In America, Kusama&apos;s installations caught the eye of critics and collectors. Her Aggregation: One Thousand Boats Show - a real rowing boat encrusted with phallic protuberances - caused a sensation when it appeared at the Gertrude Stein Gallery in New York in 1963. &quot;That kind of exhibition was extremely avant garde at the time,&quot; she says. &quot;Jackson Pollock and abstract expressionism were the big thing then. But they all came to see me and asked me why I did what I did. I said I just do Kusama art.&quot; Andy Warhol, she says, asked her permission to use the patterns in his silk screens. She refused. &quot;People were queueing in the streets, waiting to see a Kusama original,&quot; she says. &quot;After my mirror room show, other artists like Claes Oldenburg started making soft sculptures. So many artists have been influenced by my art and repeat my vision.&quot; But Kusama&apos;s mental health deteriorated to such an extent that, in 1973, she returned home for treatment. In 1975 she checked herself into the psychiatric hospital she still calls home, finding that the routine gave her the order she needed to concentrate on her work. She slowly crept back into the public consciousness, and in 2006 she was awarded the Praemium Imperiale, one of Japan&apos;s most prestigious arts prizes. Kusama has often said that if it weren&apos;t for art, she would have killed herself long ago. &quot;I only slept two hours last night. When I get tired from making pictures, I find it really difficult to go to sleep. But it&apos;s how I get away from my illness and escape the hallucinations. I call it psychosomatic art.&quot; So why does her work seem more like a celebration of life&apos;s euphoric moments? &quot;I don&apos;t really think about what my emotions are. I don&apos;t plan to make them nice and cheerful, but once I start, they just move in that direction. My hands start moving before I can think anything.&quot; Kusama will be happy if the new exhibition &quot;brings people around to the idea of the infinity of the cosmos and the beauty of life. Nothing I do stays in the gallery space. Everything I do is a walk in my mind. There are no limits.&quot; It seems almost inappropriate to ask if she ever considers retiring. &quot;No. As long as I have the energy, I will carry on. I&apos;d like to live 200 or 300 years. I want to leave my message to my successors and future generations.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/08/pound-falls-labour-european-elections", "sentences": ["&quot;I don&apos;t see the rally that we&apos;ve had over the last couple of months as being sustainable,&quot; said John Vautrain, energy analyst at consultancy Purvin &amp; Gertz in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-08T11:00:21Z", "title": "Pound falls back as Labour woes mount", "tags": ["Currencies", "Economics", "European elections", "Politics", "Business"], "article": "Sterling slumped to its lowest level against the dollar in two weeks this morning on the back of collapsing support for Gordon Brown and the Labour party.

Although there are &quot;three or four parties showing serious interest&quot; in a takeover, nobody has been willing to offer the money Ashley has demanded, with sources indicating they are attempting to get him to lower the asking price. However, Ashley, is determined to get the money he wants and is not interested in an auction. The statement released by the board to confirm the asking price earlier this week was designed to reinforce that fact. Despite Ashley&apos;s desperation to cut his losses \u2013 he will have lost more than \u00a3134m in two years even if he does sell for \u00a3100m \u2013 Newcastle have reacted scornfully to claims from the Singapore-based Profitable Group they are involved in talks to buy the club. Although an anonymous spokesman for Profitable insisted on Tuesday they intend to buy Newcastle, appoint Alan Shearer as manager, provide significant transfer funds and increase the capacity of St James&apos; Park to 60,000, nobody at the club is taking their interest seriously. Profitable, who use the former Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon in an ambassadorial role, did have contact with Newcastle last summer regarding some business in the Far East. But Newcastle&apos;s managing director, Derek Llambias, is adamant they have not heard from them since and it is understood the club&apos;s board have written the group off as time wasters. When Ashley tried to sell last year, Newcastle experienced similar problems in trying to discover which parties were actually interested in doing a deal and those who were using the club to promote themselves. On that occasion, consortiums from Nigeria and South Africa used the media to claim they were interested in buying the club before failing to make any sort of bid. There have also been persistent rumours on Tyneside that the former chairman Freddy Shepherd is part of another interested consortium, although this has still not been confirmed by anyone involved in the sale process. If Shepherd did return to the club in an official capacity he has already indicated he would immediately appoint Shearer manager. Shearer is still waiting to discover whether Ashley will confirm his appointment as permanent manager before he sells the club, even though he privately feels the sports retailer is dragging his feet in the hope he can sell up before he has to make that sort of decision. The former Newcastle captain spoke to Llambias on Monday in a bid to find out precisely why there has been a delay in confirming his appointment, but was given little reason to believe a resolution to the saga is near. Shearer has merely been told to be patient as talks are ongoing, with the banks in charge of restructuring the club&apos;s finances following its relegation from the Premier League. He was, however, reassured that Ashley did still want to make him the club&apos;s permanent manager, even though he is still waiting after more than a fortnight of negotiations and the club is in limbo with just three weeks until the players report back for pre-season training. A source close to Shearer said: &quot;Alan is going to wait, that is all he can do at the moment. He hasn&apos;t been told very much, just that these things take time and they are still talking to the banks. His biggest worry is that the club is managerless and nobody is planning for next season.

Shepherd has been desperate to regain control at St James&apos; Park ever since he was ousted by Ashley when the sports retailer secretly purchased Sir John Hall&apos;s majority shareholding two years ago. And his interest is serious enough for Shearer to have met him this week should he declare an intention to buy the club. Several groups are in talks with the man in charge of the sale, the chairman of Seymour Pierce, Keith Harris, and Shepherd&apos;s is one of them. In common with most of the prospective buyers \u2013 reports have also claimed interest from Oman and South Africa \u2013 Shepherd has guaranteed Shearer will be named manager as soon as a takeover is complete. That would suit Shearer, although he has not given up hope he will be appointed by Ashley before the sale has been completed so that he can start to plan for life in the Championship. The former England captain was expected to be given a long-term contract to manage the club as soon as the season ended but he has been left in limbo for more than a fortnight, a delay Ashley&apos;s people say is the responsibility of the banks who are restructuring the club&apos;s finances after relegation. Although Shepherd&apos;s interest is known by Ashley, sources have indicated he is not sure who is providing the money needed to meet the \u00a3100m asking price. As a result, the Newcastle board have responded cautiously to the approach and will not move any further until Shepherd is able to provide proof of funds. That will involve \u00a3100m being deposited into an offshore bank account to prove they have the resources to complete the deal.

None is proven on turf, but since the track at Ascot was relaid horses coming off artificial surfaces have done pretty well. Ward, who has his team based in Newmarket for the Ascot raid, seems to be particularly keen on the filly Aegean, who runs in the Albany Stakes tomorrow week. He also has runners in the Coventry Stakes and the Queen Mary Stakes on the first two days of the meeting, so we should get a clue to the strength of the American juveniles. Jealous Again, who ran second to Aegean at Keeneland, is the Queen Mary runner and I gather she impressed work-watchers when the Ward horses were put through their paces in Newmarket yesterday morning. It is clear, however, that there are some above-average two-year-olds from Britain and Ireland ready to spring to the home defence. In the Coventry, Richard Hannon&apos;s Canford Cliffs sets a high standard. He looked an exceptional talent when scoring by seven lengths on his only start at Newbury, clocking an outstanding time in the process. Then there is Rose Blossom in the Queen Mary. Highclere Thoroughbreds recently bought into this Richard Fahey-trained filly, who won by 4\u00bd lengths on her debut at Hamilton, breaking a course record for five furlongs that had stood since 1972. Described as a &quot;freak&quot; by her trainer, she has more than a hint of the 2003 Queen Mary winner, Attraction, about her. Ward also plans to run the four-year-old Cannonball in both the King&apos;s Stand Stakes and the Golden Jubilee. The gelding is virtually ignored in ante-post betting, at 50-1, but history tells us not to ignore foreign sprinters. The American-trained Mighty Beau was not beaten far when fifth in the King&apos;s Stand four years ago. In fact this Group One contest has only once been won by a home-trained sprinter in the last six years, and that was the seven-year-old The Tatling in 2004. Australia&apos;s Choisir was overlooked by British punters in 2003, winning at odds of 25-1 before following up in the Golden Jubilee four days later. After the exploits of Takeover Target and Miss Andretti, the King&apos;s Stand winners in 2006 and 2007, no one underestimates the Australian challenge now and next Tuesday Daniel Morton&apos;s Scenic Blast is 7-2 second favourite with Hill&apos;s. A dual Group One winner at home this year, the five-year-old looks a tough opponent for Henry Candy&apos;s 3-1 favourite, Amour Propre. Scenic Blast will very likely reappear in the Golden Jubilee on the Saturday of Ascot, when South Africa&apos;s JJ The Jet Plane and Sacred Kingdom, the pride of Hong Kong, lie in wait. The form lines from Sacred Kingdom&apos;s Group One win in Singapore last month suggest he can repay the \u00a345,000 it has cost connections to get into the Golden Jubilee. He is a tempting 6-1 with Coral. For the notebook Agente Parmigiano 7f Epsom Like so many on this switchback track, Gerard Butler&apos;s colt looked ill at ease on the camber in the home straight and, after a slow start, was left with plenty to do. He did well to reach fifth behind Cloudy Start and will be seen to better effect on a more conventional course. War Party 1m4f Epsom Another who did not seem to handle the track, this French import still stuck on to finish fifth behind Coin Of The Realm after racing close to the pace.

Delegator has run twice this term with Spencer on board. He started favourite for the English 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket but finished second to Sea The Stars. The colt then floundered in heavy going when unplaced behind Mastercraftsman in the Irish Guineas at The Curragh. Fortune was on board for the first of Delegator&apos;s two races in his two-year-old campaign last season, but Spencer took over for the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket at the end of last season when the colt could only finish fifth. 1.10pm Blast looks too big at 4-1 Greg Wood reports: In 1836, Lord Bentinck, one of the most influential figures in the early history of the turf, took the bookmakers for a fortune when his colt Elis won the St Leger. Elis had every chance on the book, but Bentinck managed to bump up the odds by leaving him at his base in Sussex until just a few days before the race at Town Moor.  This was a time when horses simply walked to their racing engagements, and since the bookies were aware that Elis was still a long way from Doncaster and the Classic was now imminent, the odds extended by the day. Elis, they reasoned, would either miss the race entirely, or be so tired on arrival that he would not run his race.  Bentinck, however, was several steps ahead of them. He had commissioned a local carriage-builder to construct what was, in effect, one of the first proper horse boxes. With a team of six horses to pull him along at a rate of nearly 100 miles a day, Elis got to Town Moor in good time and prime condition, and duly won as he pleased.  What relevance does this have to Royal Ascot 2009, or an age of blogs and the world wide web? Just these two thoughts. The first is that, just as in 1836, you still need to be in possession of all the relevant facts to make money from betting. The second - how refreshing it would be to discover that even in 2009, it is still possible for something to slip under the radar amid the blizzard of data that bombards us around the clock.  Scenic Blast, for instance. Australian sprinters have been travelling to Royal Ascot - with great success - for several years, and are now accorded plenty of respect. As a result, the latest speedster from down under has been sitting towards the top of the betting for the King&apos;s Stand Stakes for several weeks. But how many northern-hemisphere punters have actually seen footage of him racing? Very few, at a guess, and I was one of them until this morning&apos;s press conference at Newmarket, which showcased the significant overseas challenge - from Australia, South Africa and even the United States - both for next week&apos;s sprints at the Royal meeting and then the July Cup at Newmarket.  YouTube has a video of him winning the Lightning Stakes over five furlongs at Flemington in January and even at first viewing, it is hard not to wonder why he is still available at 4-1 for the King&apos;s Stand Stakes on Tuesday (and most bookies are now non-runner, no bet). Few horses are capable of travelling and making ground so smoothly in a five-furlong Group One, and Scenic Blast has an outstanding turn of foot too. Joe Janiak, whose Takeover Target is a past winner of the King&apos;s Stand and will be competing, at the age of 10, in the Golden Jubilee Stakes on Saturday week, tipped Scenic Blast to win on Tuesday at this morning&apos;s press conference at Newmarket, and also seems confident that Takeover Target is back to his best form after a disappointing run in Singapore last month.  Janiak, incidentally, seems suitably flattered that the Takeover Target story is apparently going to be made into a film, with Russell Crowe, no less, playing the former taxi-driver turned trainer. Janiak had a simple answer yesterday when someone asked what his ambition was when he bought the unraced gelding for A$1,400. &quot;To break even,&quot; he said.  Mike de Kock, meanwhile, now has 15 horses at his satellite yard in Newmarket, and will attempt to add a Royal Ascot success to his many big-race wins around the world when JJ The Jet Plane lines up for the Golden Jubilee.  &quot;Everyone wants to compete in the majors, and Royal Ascot is a major,&quot; de Kock said. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt that he&apos;s a much better horse on turf [rather than dirt, on which he disappointed in Dubai earlier this year] and in a way that his run in Dubai was probably a blessing in disguise as it meant that we didn&apos;t have too push him too hard [at that stage of the season].&quot;  2.20pm Meehan explains Delegator decision Tony Paley reports: Trainer Brian Meehan has told racingpost.com: &quot;Jimmy won on Delegator last season, and it was always the case that he would share the ride with Jamie this season, with the decision depending on who was available.&quot; Meehan added: &quot;I told Jamie about Jimmy&apos;s booking for Royal Ascot, and he understood.&quot; 2.25pm Meehan finds a possible angel in Arc Tony Paley reports: Arcano looked a colt with plenty of potential as he landed the opener at Newbury today. Newmarket&apos;s July meeting could now be on the agenda for the winner as trainer Brian Meehan observed: &quot;He runs for the same syndicate as Gallagher, who returns in the Jersey Stakes next week, and we&apos;ve always liked him.  &quot;He did everything perfect, which is great as he hadn&apos;t done a lot at home. There will be huge improvement to come from him mentally and physically, and all being well we&apos;ll run him in the July Stakes next. We&apos;ll play it by ear and see how he comes out of it, but Newmarket would make a lot of sense, as there&apos;s a nice gap until then.&quot; Meanwhile, the Pat Eddery-trained Aerodynamic, another two-year-old successful on his debut at Nottingham this afternoon, is on course for the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot next week after his victoty.

Still, Barry&apos;s unveiling at City today - just as Sky Sports&apos; breaking news ticker was entering its second non-stop hour of announcing His \u00a380m transfer to Real Madrid (now seven hours and counting) - was notable for one thing: the midfielder&apos;s insistence that &quot;the ambition was the main thing for me&quot;. Of course it was Gareth. And the doubling of your salary to \u00a3100,000-a-week was merely a kirsch-soaked cherry on a big, light-blue-icing-tinged cake. However Barry soon tripped up faster than Mr Em running for a five-yard throughball, telling the BBC: &quot;I said I would have stayed when [Villa] were flying in the league and I&apos;d have stayed to my word. [Big Cup] football is big for myself and playing with Aston Villa would have meant more than doing it anywhere else but it wasn&apos;t to be.&quot; And nor was getting the chance to win the Premier League, Big Cup and Scouse Senior Men&apos;s Trophy with Liverpool. &quot;It&apos;s completely out of my mind, worrying about Liverpool and what could have been,&quot; Barry continued. &quot;That&apos;s all in the past.

South Africa, Hong Kong, Australia and the United States will all send major players to the big sprint events in Berkshire next week, and for Britain&apos;s training fraternity, left trailing by Ireland in the Derby last weekend, further embarrassment surely awaits. Scenic Blast, trained by Dan Morton in Perth in Western Australia, is second-favourite for the King&apos;s Stand Stakes on Tuesday, while three of the first four names in the betting for the Golden \u00adJubilee Stakes sprint four days later are trained outside Europe. Morton is just 36, and had no idea at the turn of the year that he might need a \u00adtailcoat in June. Scenic Blast was not among the favourites when he won the Lightning Stakes at Flemington back in \u00adJanuary, the victory that earned him an invitation to Ascot. &quot;I&apos;d never put much homework into coming here until we got the invite but it&apos;s a big gig,&quot; Morton said in the Jockey Club rooms here in Newmarket yesterday. &quot;Obviously we know that it&apos;s the mecca for you guys, but the Aussies have been up here quite a few times now and there&apos;s been quite a lot of coverage down there from the Choisir years on, so we&apos;re fully aware of it.&quot; Choisir was an unconsidered 25-1 chance when he won the King&apos;s Stand in 2003, but two more Australian victories in the same race since \u2013 by Miss Andretti and Takeover Target, who will run in the Golden Jubilee Stakes tomorrow week \u2013 have ensured that Australian contenders now receive much more respect. &quot;He was very impressive,&quot; Morton says. &quot;He looked to still have the handbrake on with two furlongs to go when the rest were all under pressure. It was a good field, and he was pretty dominant. &quot;If I was going to pick any horse out of my string to travel [this far], he&apos;d be the one. He&apos;s very laid-back, and apart from it being a long haul, I had no real concerns. &quot;At home, the east coast is where it all happens, so if we want to perform on the big stage, that&apos;s where we go. It&apos;s nearly four hours on the plane, and he&apos;s done it three times, so he knows all about getting on and off, it&apos;s just a lot longer in the air.&quot; Scenic Blast caught Morton&apos;s eye as soon as he saw him at a yearling sale in Australia. &quot;He was a beautiful yearling,&quot; he says. &quot;My dad [also a trainer] and myself do all the yearlings, and to us he was a standout. We got him fairly cheap for A$85,000 (\u00a342,000 at current rates). Steve Arnold [his regular jockey] will ride, he&apos;s first-class, and it was more important for me to have someone who knew my horse than someone who knew the track.&quot; Scenic Blast&apos;s run on Tuesday will determine whether he also contests the Golden Jubilee Stakes, but with Takeover Target, Hong Kong&apos;s top sprinter Sacred Kingdom and Mike de Kock&apos;s JJ The Jet Plane in the field, the race still appears marked for export. &quot;It&apos;s a big effort [to run in two races in a week] so we are just going for the Golden Jubilee this year,&quot; Joe Janiak, Takeover Target&apos;s trainer, said yesterday. &quot;Sacred Kingdom looks the biggest danger after he won in Singapore last time. He&apos;s a great horse but then again he&apos;s got to travel and everything has to go right. JJ The Jet Plane was very convincing the other day, those are the two I respect.&quot; Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Yirga 3.50 Sandown Unable to quicken in the closing stages in testing ground at Haydock last month, Yirga should be more effective on this better going. The Godolphin colt certainly looks well handicapped off a mark of 74, having chased home the useful Desert Creek on his debut last season. Yirga went on to finish third, beaten a length, by Laudatory at Kempton and meets the winner on 9lb better terms here."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jun/12/mike-ashley-newcastle-united-singapore-profitable", "sentences": ["As Mike Ashley considers how Singapore&apos;s Profitable Group will seek to turn a profit from investing \u00a3100m in Newcastle United and turning it into a fans&apos; trust, investors are wondering where is the upside in other Profitable interests.", "Our headquarters are in Singapore and that would be the last place on earth for corporate shenanigans because the penalty for it is death.&quot; But could Profitable Group by any chance be a new incarnation of The Profitable Plot Company that was the subject of a 2007 application for compulsory winding-up by the then secretary of state for trade and industry, only voluntarily to appoint a liquidator six months later?", "Tim Goldring, Nigel Blanchard and Neil Osborn were directors of that firm and all are now listed on the Singapore firm&apos;s website."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-11T23:05:10Z", "title": "Prospective Newcastle investors face questions over hotel plans | Matt Scott", "tags": ["Mike Ashley", "Newcastle United", "Championship", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "As Mike Ashley considers how Singapore&apos;s Profitable Group will seek to turn a profit from investing \u00a3100m in Newcastle United and turning it into a fans&apos; trust, investors are wondering where is the upside in other Profitable interests. Among those interests is &quot;Profitable Plots ... a strategic land investment company&quot;. This offers the chance to buy land such as at Cherry Tree Grove in Colchester which, once planning permission is received, will instantly increase in value. But how to reconcile those promises with two separate local authority refusals of plans to build a 77-bed and then 87-bed hotel at Cherry Tree Grove on the grounds that it is too far out of town and in a Countryside Conservation Area? One respondent during the planning application process thinks he knows the answer. &quot;These companies purchase protected land and then make proposals for development. They then resell the land to investors at 10 times or more profit in Asia and Canada, giving the impression that planning permission will be achieved,&quot; the respondent wrote to planners. Not so, says Profitable&apos;s Canadian client services manager, Dan Strumos. &quot;These accusations are false. Our headquarters are in Singapore and that would be the last place on earth for corporate shenanigans because the penalty for it is death.&quot; But could Profitable Group by any chance be a new incarnation of The Profitable Plot Company that was the subject of a 2007 application for compulsory winding-up by the then secretary of state for trade and industry, only voluntarily to appoint a liquidator six months later? The very same! Tim Goldring, Nigel Blanchard and Neil Osborn were directors of that firm and all are now listed on the Singapore firm&apos;s website. There is one new face, though: the group commercial director and former Liverpool captain, Steve McMahon. It&apos;s a funny old game. Toon-less in the Algarve One guess which club was the most notable absentee from opening of the two-day Football League meeting on the Algarve. Quite right: Newcastle United, although St James&apos; Park executives might have picked up a tip or two. Speakers in a conference on how football must tackle the economic recession were the head of Deloitte&apos;s sports group, Dan Jones, and the former Millwall owner and TV Dragon, Theo Paphitis. Mawhinney headacheThe Football League chairman, Brian Mawhinney, will today attempt to persuade his clubs to adopt one of the measures which he outlined in his letter last month to the former culture secretary, Andy Burnham. But it will not be easy. Not only does Lord Mawhinney need a majority of all clubs to back his proposal to place transfer embargoes on teams who fall behind on payments to the taxman, he also requires the support of half of the chairmen of Championship clubs. And one owner of a major tier-two club grumbled: &quot;It is a fundamental right of any business to negotiate with its creditors. This must not be allowed to happen.&quot;Under the Hammer? West Ham United&apos;s new owner, Straumur, is expected to receive the Reykjavik courts&apos; confirmation to continue trading for six more months with the extension of a standstill agreement with creditors today. But a bigger challenge lies on 6 August when its plans for the Premier League club&apos;s future are laid out to creditors. If they consider that piecemeal the club is more valuable than the loss-making sum of its parts, fans should brace themselves for a fire sale of players. After all, a share of \u00a350m raised in the transfer market this summer is bread today; why wait five years for a possible share of \u00a3150m of jam tomorrow when that gamble is predicated on staying in the Premier League? Cup construction concern Yesterday marked 365 days out from the World Cup in South Africa and there is still much work to be done on stadium construction. Cape Town&apos;s Green Point stadium is only 60% complete after a four-month delay caused by the accommodation of a colony of local seagulls. Most other new builds are only 70% finished and there is just six months left before testing must begin under Fifa rules. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/16/golf-olympic-bid-colin-montgomerie", "sentences": ["The voting procedure for Olympic inclusion has been changed to avoid a repeat of the situation in Singapore in 2005, when baseball and softball were voted out of the London games but karate and squash failed to achieve the two thirds of votes required from the full IOC membership to replace them."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-15T23:26:00Z", "title": "Golfers crave Olympic gold, says Colin Montgomerie", "tags": ["Colin Montgomerie", "Golf", "Rugby union", "Sport"], "article": "Colin Montgomerie insisted yesterday that winning an Olympic gold medal would mean more to top golfers than winning a major, as he led a final push for the sport to be included in the Games from 2016. Along with rugby sevens, golf is considered a strong favourite to be one of two sports put forward by the International Olympic Committee for inclusion in the Games after a series of presentations to its executive board at its headquarters in Lausanne today. The other sports competing for inclusion were baseball, karate, roller sports, softball and squash. Montgomerie was one member of a high level delegation that delivered golf&apos;s 45-minute presentation, which he said included &quot;one of the most moving videos I&apos;ve even seen on the game&quot;. The sport&apos;s high profile and commercial potential are likely to play in its favour as it seeks a return to the Olympic line up for the first time since 1904. The campaign has won the backing of top players including Tiger Woods, but like other lucrative individual sports including tennis, it will face questions over its importance to its biggest names. Montgomerie, who delivered golf&apos;s case alongside Annika Sorenstam, the winner of 10 women&apos;s majors, said motivation would not be a consideration, predicting &quot;100%&quot; of the top players would sign up. &quot;All the corporate logos would be off and you&apos;d be playing with a Great Britain shirt. I think that means an awful lot to anybody. I speak for all Olympic athletes,&quot; he said. Even for globally popular sports like golf and rugby, Olympic status will boost their popularity in new areas of the globe and open up new commercial opportunities. Conversely, the IOC is keen to broaden the appeal of the Olympic programme, particularly among young people, and boost its own revenue-generating appeal among sponsors and broadcasters. The European Ryder Cup captain, who will be 53 in 2016, sought to deny suggestions that an Olympic medal would mean less than a major championship and said he was confident that the top 60 players would want to compete. &quot;For every one chance we have the possibility of \u00adwinning an Olympic gold medal we have 16 majors to compete for,&quot; he said, adding that to win a gold would more than make up for his failure to win a major. &quot;It would make up for that and the rest. To be the first gold medal winner for 112 years would be a massive achievement for whoever wins.&quot; The International Rugby Board delegation, which had made a canny political move by offering to make the Olympics the pinnacle of its four-year cycle in place of the Sevens World Cup, said it was pleased with how its pitch had gone. IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset said its panel had stressed the suitability of Sevens as part of a multi-sport event and sought to reiterate that it was prospering in its own right as a distinct alternative to the 15-man game. &quot;The fans love it, it&apos;s great for TV, it&apos;s easy to understand,&quot; said the IRB chief executive, Mike Miller. He said top players from the 15-man game had also indicated their desire to play. The voting procedure for Olympic inclusion has been changed to avoid a repeat of the situation in Singapore in 2005, when baseball and softball were voted out of the London games but karate and squash failed to achieve the two thirds of votes required from the full IOC membership to replace them. Later this week, the four contenders to host the 2016 Games, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid, will have an opportunity to expand on their plans before the IOC membership vote in Copenhagen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jun/20/talking-horse-royal-ascot", "sentences": ["He had to be at peak form to take on the unbeaten Rocket Man on the latter&apos;s home turf in Singapore last month."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-20T09:00:00Z", "title": "Talking horses | Today's best bets and news from Royal Ascot", "tags": ["Royal Ascot", "Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "5.45pm: Queen Alexandra Stakes result 1 Caracciola (E Ahern) 6-1, 2 Tyrrells Wood (J Fanning) 9-2, 3 Amerigo (P Robinson) 4-1. 10 ran (NRs, 4, 6). A tremendous Royal Ascot meeting got a fairytale finish when 12-year-old Caracciola took the closing Queen Alexandra Stakes. Nicky Henderson&apos;s gelding, the former Cesarewitch winner, became the oldest ever winner at the royal meeting. Richard Hughes needed a first or second place finish on Tasheba, to wrest the jockeys&apos; title from Johnny Murtagh, but he was on the wrong Henderson horse. 5.07pm: Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes result 1 Drill Sergeant (J Fanning) 14-1, 2 Record Breaker (R Ffrench) 14-1, 3 Martyr (R Hughes) 14-1, 4 Young Mick (T Queally) 8-1. 17 ran. Mark Johnston saddled a 1-2 in the final handicap at Royal Ascot when Joe Fanning rode his second winner of the meeting on Drill Sergeant. There was drama at the start when William Buick was unshipped from the well-fancied Hatton Flight just yards after the gates opened. Drill Sergeant went clear after turning for home and always looked like collecting, although Royston Ffrench got a great wide run out of Record Breaker. Richard Hughes was third on Martyr and is now the only jockey who can take the leading riders&apos; title from Johnny Murtagh.

Richard Hughes drew level with Johnny Murtagh at the top of the jockeys&apos; list for the week when getting a short-head verdict ahead of Ryan Moore, riding his eighth runner-up of the week. Chris Cook, update from Ascot The going is good to firm, as it has been all week, though there were clear signs yesterday that it was getting faster as the week goes on - track records were beaten in three of yesterday&apos;s six races, though those records have only stood for three years at most, as the newly aligned straight was first used in 2006. Another 4mm of artificial watering was applied to the track last night and there has been 1mm of rain this morning.  Major Eazy is lame and will not run in the Wokingham, while Bun Oir will miss the Chesham. Inventor and Camps Bay are out of the Duke Of Edinburgh, Noddies Way out of the Queen Alexandra. A sell-out crowd is expected and Talking Horses would like to suggest that, in the circumstances, a few more trains between Waterloo and Ascot might be in order. Would-be passengers for the 9.40am at Twickenham this morning were forced to hurl themselves into the packed bodies that presented themselves when the doors opened - you wouldn&apos;t want to be there a couple of hours later. Still, nobody&apos;s spirits seemed to suffer in the crush. Cans of lager were passed around, while bottles of champagne were being opened on Ascot High Street at 10.15am. Those revellers are going to struggle when time comes to study the form for the Duke Of Edinburgh. Ron Cox&apos;s tips for today&apos;s racing Following the success of Australia&apos;s Scenic Blast in Tuesday&apos;s King&apos;s Stand Stakes, the second Group One sprint of the week at Royal Ascot also looks set for export today. Sacred Kingdom, the pride of Hong Kong, can stamp his authority on the Golden Jubilee Stakes. Connections of Sacred Kingdom (3.45) have forked out \u00a345,000 to supplement the six-year-old, who has won almost \u00a32m in prize money with 12 wins from 18 starts. He had a setback last September and took time to find his form this year, but has come right back to his best. He had to be at peak form to take on the unbeaten Rocket Man on the latter&apos;s home turf in Singapore last month. Sacred Kingdom put up a mighty performance to beat the previously unbeaten four-year-old by a neck and they were clear of Diabolical in a hotly contested Group One event. The Godolphin sprinter Diabolical has been a regular in top sprints over here, providing form lines which give Sacred Kingdom a clear advantage over the \u00adBritish contenders. In an international line-up, this could end up a duel between Sacred Kingdom and South Africa&apos;s JJ The Jet Plane, who slammed Intrepid Jack in his warm-up race at Windsor. Royal Ascot 2.30 Aidan O&apos;Brien won this with Bach and can follow up with Beethoven, who went down narrowly to Love Lockdown, a previous winner, in a six-furlongs event at Naas. Staying on well at the finish, Beethoven will benefit from this extra furlong. Royal Ascot 3.05 Under a crafty front-running ride from Frankie Dettori, \u00adCampanologist got the better of Conduit in the King Edward VII Stakes here last year and he may well repeat the feat at the expense of Conduit&apos;s stable companion, Doctor Fremantle. Campanologist looked and ran as though in need of the race last time at Sandown. He will be sharper now. Doctor Fremantle can be keen in his races and this may not be run to suit him if \u00adCampanologist gets his way in front. Newmarket In the first of four decidedly tricky handicaps on this card, \u00adRomanticize (2.10) looks capable of progressing on the step up to seven furlongs. She became outpaced before running on strongly to get within a length of White Shift in a six-furlongs handicap here last month. Baunagain (2.40), having his first start for the Peter Chapple-Hyam stable, is a \u00adreliable performer. The promising \u00adapprentice rider, Louis-Philippe Beuzelin, has good prospects of notching a double on Respite (3.15) and Strictly (3.50). Both fillies look reasonably handicapped, Strictly having accounted for the subsequent winner Lochan Mor on her latest start. Ayr A comparatively rare runner at this course for trainer Andrew Balding, Peking Prince (2.25) looked good value for his win at Newbury and can defy an 8lb higher mark. A form line involving \u00adJustonefortheroad gives Peking Prince the \u00adbeating of Brian Meehan&apos;s African Art. Speedy Percolator (2.55) is the one to beat in the Listed race for fillies. At Redcar, the seven-furlongs handicap looks tailor-made for Osteopathic Remedy (3.30). Horse sense Clive Cox has won both the Royal Hunt Cup and the Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot, and there is confidence in Jimmy Styles (4.25) as he attempts to land the Wokingham for the Lambourn trainer today. Smart sprinter Balthazaar&apos;s Gift, a recent arrival at the Cox stable, gives the trainer a good guide to the wellbeing of Jimmy Styles in home gallops. Our Newmarket contact is keen to stick with Ialysos (3.45) in the Golden Jubilee. Luca Cumani&apos;s Greek import has continued to thrive since winning on his debut for the yard at Haydock. Brian Meehan&apos;s Inventor (5.00), who has a record of going well when fresh, is in good shape for the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes. Tasheba (5.35) will come in for support in the Queen Alexandra Stakes. The Richard Hannon team are keen to give Big Audio (2.30) another chance in the Chesham Stakes. He works well with the stable&apos;s good juveniles at home. Newmarket trainer John Ryan had Silver Grecian entered for the Chesham, but has opted for the maiden race (4.20) at his local track. Ryan has called on Kieren Fallon to ride the grey in his prep work and he has been shaping up well. Michael Hills partners Silver Grecian at Newmarket and can kick off with a winner on his father&apos;s Glen Molly (2.10). Unlucky last time, this filly will be hard to beat, provided the ground is not too fast. Something Perfect (3.15) and Zuzu (3.50) are others to note here. At Ayr, Aleatricis (3.25) can continue his good form for John Quinn. A penalty for scoring here will increase the four-year-old&apos;s chances of making the line-up for next Saturday&apos;s Northumberland Plate at Newcastle. Seen and heard An interesting email was doing the rounds at Ascot this week. Clearly written by a member of staff at one of Britain&apos;s most famous racing yards, it included an analysis of all the stable&apos;s runners at the meeting, with a depth of insight the trainer concerned would never provide to the media to the media. The honest assessment of the chances of more than a dozen horses also included , as well as some decidedly pithy observations about runners from other yards. Woe betide the writer if the trainer in question ever finds out. Ron Cox&apos;s tip of the day Jimmy Styles Royal Ascot 4.25 Forgotten Voice started from stall one when winning Wednesday&apos;s Royal Hunt Cup, and the stands side draw can prove lucky for Jimmy Styles. Injury curtailed this gelding&apos;s 2008 campaign, but he has come back better than ever and, following a close second here, he won in good style at Newmarket. With his high cruising speed, he should be suited by the fast pace in this big field."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/jun/21/alain-de-botton-my-week", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve been to Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, the US, France, Italy and the Netherlands - all in the name of promoting my book."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-20T23:01:00Z", "title": "My week: Alain de Botton", "tags": ["Books", "Culture"], "article": "I&apos;m routinely astonished by how seriously people in power take the impact of advertising on children and how relatively unbothered they are by its impact on adults. At what precise moment is one supposed to accede to that magical age when one can be confident enough not to be seduced by the satanic genius of advertisers? I find it hard to resist anything that is dangled my way.  Capitalist society operates under the bizarre presumption that adults are rational, self-determining individuals who can make sensible choices between competing goods and so maximise their chances of happiness. But in reality, we are desperately open to being swayed in unhelpful directions by a mere glimpse at a picture. It&apos;s extremely hard to hold on to a sense of our needs when our desires are continually inflamed.  We have been encouraged to believe that the media should always operate on a free-market model and that any attempt to limit and control them would be akin to Stalinist censorship. But that&apos;s to imagine, first, that we are far more sure of our needs than we actually are. And, second, that censorship must inevitably involve the promotion of an unpleasant ideology. However, the modern consensus on kids&apos; advertising shows the way to a truth that may take a few more years for us to accept: that censorship can easily be benign and that we may well need to be saved from our own worst impulses. The problem with predictions about technology is that they are generally way ahead of their time, but typically frighteningly true. For at least 10 years now, people have been suggesting that web technology is going to make us lose our powers of concentration and that among other things, the long-form book will die. From a straw poll of friends and a little soul-searching, my feeling is that this has finally happened. Google, Twitter, Facebook, email, the iPhone, the Blackberry and the web have all finally conspired to kill our ability to be alone and unstimulated. Our unaided minds can no longer possibly hope to emulate the thrills available from these devilish technologies. Sales of serious books have plunged 39% since this time last year. We are at an epochal moment. Our intelligence has ended up making us stupid; it&apos;s a miracle if you are still reading. The main political parties fervently agree on how terrific education is. It&apos;s our salvation; it will make men and women out of feral delinquents; it&apos;s modern liberal society&apos;s best hope. But then it&apos;s amazing how casual we are about the delivery of this holy grail. We sincerely believe that you can educate someone just by sending them to university for three years. Compare this relaxed approach to how the world religions approach the problem of education. In order to make people into good, noble humans, religions know that it&apos;s no use sending them off to a few classes. Instead, they need continual reminders of virtue and wisdom or they will go off the rails. They need prayers eight times a day, beautiful buildings, timetables, sermons, sculptures, prayer wheels, ceremonies and rituals.  And what do secular educationalists think they need? At best a degree before moving on to the milk round. I hazard a guess that a few centuries from now we&apos;ll look back and think of ourselves as unusually relaxed about our capacity to stay on the straight and narrow. Since 2 April, when my new book came out, I&apos;ve hardly spent more than two days at home at a stretch. I&apos;ve been to Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, the US, France, Italy and the Netherlands - all in the name of promoting my book. The audiences have been terrific, so I don&apos;t want to sound ungrateful, but it does seem bizarre how much people want to see authors in the flesh. The decline in the oral tradition stemmed from a sensible realisation that you didn&apos;t really need a person to be singing his poem to you around the campfire. You could just read his book. But this insight, greatly facilitated by the invention of printing, is in danger of being lost.  People today want to witness authors in front of them and find their books to be far more desirable if they carry a signature on them. Only psycho-analysis and ethnography seem capable of explaining a phenomenon like the modern literary festival, behind which there seems to lie an archaic suspicion of printing and a desire to see that the words on the page were truly put there by a human, whose hand one wants to physically witness moving across paper. One of the most shocking things you can say, when people ask: &quot;How are you?&quot; is to say you are feeling a bit lonely. Yet I&apos;ve been travelling around feeling desperately lonely for weeks. I&apos;ve met people, but not the sort on whom I could unburden myself. Real friendship is based on saying halfway unacceptable things, normally of a pessimistic nature. Society is dominated by optimism. One has to stay cheerful, when deep down most of us long to express panic and despair. This is a reminder of what books should really be about: to tell us what society is too squeamish to hear, a repository of all the secrets that are far too peculiar or offbeat for the world at large. My eldest child is only four years old, but already last week he came out with the line (in response to being told he was too noisy): &quot;Well, I never asked to be born.&quot; I thought I had at least 10 years to go before hearing this, but evidently children are growing up very fast. However, a great aspect of Darwinian theory is that it gives one the perfect retort to such a line, namely: &quot;Well, I never asked to be a parent.&quot; In the Darwinian account, we are as helpless not to propagate our DNA as our children are helpless to come into existence. Parenthood is not a chosen act, but a biological command, a hugely consoling thought during the inevitable moments, as one wearily tidies Lego, when one is tempted to question the peculiar course that one&apos;s life has taken.

And as Laura Robson powered into a first-set lead there was little doubt that the 4,000 fans packed into the new Court Two at Wimbledon and the thousands more watching on big screens at what we used to call Henman Hill had found a new plucky British hero. If last year&apos;s girls&apos; junior champion was nervous, she wasn&apos;t showing it. Her first serve was the first of 10 aces that flew past Daniela Hantuchova, and her powerful ground strokes appeared to overwhelm her opponent. Watched by her family and the last two British women to win Wimbledon, Virginia Wade and Ann Jones, it seemed that an upset was on the cards as Robson went a break of serve up in the second set. In the end, nerves told, she admitted, after the far more experienced Slovakian worked her way back into the game to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. &quot;I just got really nervous. You know, I made a couple more mistakes than I should have,&quot; said Robson, &quot;but she started playing more balls in the court and getting more returns in.&quot; Robson was born in Australia, but her parents moved to Singapore when she was 18 months old and settled in England when she was six.

Robson&apos;s Ridge might stick in the future, though the girl herself wasn&apos;t convinced: &quot;It&apos;s not really a ridge, is it?&quot; Her mother said that the fact her daughter had to sit an English GCSE 10 days ago may not have helped the final result: &quot;What a nightmare, trying to organise exams. Other kids don&apos;t have that sort of pressure. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s really fair, but we couldn&apos;t change it \u2026 mentally, she&apos;s still 15, and she needs to work on that side of her game. Her serve, her shots [were great]. She just needs to grow up a bit, that&apos;s all.&quot; Outside Court Two, Christine Hood, from Bridgwater in Somerset, had been one of 1,500 queuing overnight. She said she chose Court Two over the other show courts to make sure she saw Robson. &quot;You have to go back to Virginia Wade for another British woman who was this good. I just hope they don&apos;t overload her with pressure. That&apos;s what seems to happen.&quot; A poised and confident Robson, long tipped for a bright future, said she was happy overall and did not find the step up to senior level too daunting. &quot;I&apos;m just a little bit upset, but I&apos;m pretty pleased with myself,&quot; she said. It was only when she revealed that her favourite TV show was US teen drama Gossip Girl, and there was an occasional outburst of teen petulance as the match slipped away, that her tender years came to the fore. In the run-up to yesterday, Robson&apos;s agent and family had thrown a protective cordon around the player, the youngest in the main Wimbledon draw since Martina Hingis in 1995, in a vain effort to protect her from the inevitable hype. She will return next week to defend her junior title. Wade, the last British woman to win Wimbledon in 1977, had earlier said Robson&apos;s precocious talent was being handled in the right way: &quot;They&apos;re keeping her out of the public eye a little. She hasn&apos;t played quite so much, so that should protect her a little bit from burnout.&quot; The volume on the new Court Two, opened by the Duke of Kent as part of a \u00a3100m overhaul of the venue, grew louder as the chances of a Robson victory increased. In the tented hospitality villages, consumption was less conspicuous this year, but elsewhere it was business as usual. The queues were long, the gangways packed, the Pimms flowing, and there was much speculation about the weather, albeit with a nod towards when the new Centre Court roof would be pressed into action.

Justine Davies reports", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Health", "Society", "Science", "Nutrition", "Biochemistry and molecular biology", "Medical research"], "article": "&apos;Rich in antioxidants&quot; is an advertiser&apos;s dream slogan. It ensures food and drinks are snapped up in the hope of preventing ageing, cancer or heart disease. Last year, 22 million of us took a supplement and 13% of supplements sold in the UK boasted on the label that they contained antioxidants. Antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E, are marketed as good for our health but what is the evidence?  The antioxidant story started more than 40 years ago when scientists discovered that chemicals called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) react with components of our cells causing damage, sometimes irreversible. This process is called oxidative stress. ROS refer to any chemical that damages the cell by causing this stress. The &quot;damaging free radicals&quot; you hear about are one kind. Unfortunately, ROS are not avoidable; they are chemicals continually produced within our cells that generate the energy we need to stay alive. So cells also contain a battery of defences to protect us against oxidative stress.  Our cells run into trouble when these defences are overwhelmed, for example when we encounter large amounts of ROS; then oxidative stress is associated with heart disease, cancer and ageing. These insurmountable quantities of ROS may be from the environment, for example from cigarette smoke, or pollution, or they may be produced by our own bodies when we&apos;re sick.  Recognition that ROS cause disease was the first step towards our fascination with antioxidants; the substances that mop up ROS. Barry Halliwell, a professor of biochemistry at Singapore University and a world expert in free radicals, says that when research started in the mid-1990s it showed &quot;diets rich in plants were associated with lower risk of developing many age-related diseases and most people would have better health if they ate more fruits and vegetables&quot;. Plants contain large amounts of antioxidants to protect them against the ROS they produce during photosynthesis, so scientists concluded fruit and veg were beneficial for us because they contained antioxidants. After this, it was assumed that taking antioxidants in the form of vitamin pills would help prevent disease. &quot;The assumption often was that free radicals cause diseases, and antioxidants will prevent and/or cure them,&quot; says Halliwell. The media then picked up the antioxidant baton, and marketing firms began promoting &quot;anti-oxidant&quot; vitamins and skin creams, and rebranding antioxidant-rich foods as &quot;superfoods&quot;.  Unfortunately, matters weren&apos;t that simple. Although studies had shown the link between eating fruit and veg and a lower risk of disease, randomised controlled trials - where one group given antioxidant vitamins were compared with a similar group given a placebo - were needed to prove antioxidants actually worked. These trials involved thousands of patients. Although a small number showed antioxidants can be beneficial in diseases such as macular degeneration, the findings on antioxidants and diseases such as cancer, heart disease and strokes have been shocking. A paper combining the results of all previous studies showed antioxidant vitamins were not beneficial, and some even made diseases worse. In particular, giving Beta-carotene supplements, which our bodies turn into vitamin A, to smokers probably increased the risk of lung cancer. But, despite the fact that antioxidant vitamin supplements are of no value or may even increase death rates, because the marketing industry is in full stride, the best evidence has passed unnoticed. Another twist is that new research shows small amounts of oxidative stress can actually protect our cells. Dr Toren Finkel, who studies ROS for the National Institute of Health in the US, says, &quot;While ROS have for many years been viewed as purely destructive, the cell can also harness these molecules for useful purposes. These observations complicate the blanket use of antioxidants because, while inhibiting the destructive effects of ROS might be good, inhibiting the beneficial effects of free radicals might have unintended consequences.&quot; Professor Trey Ideker at the University of California, San Diego, has shown that ROS may trigger hormesis, where exposure to a small amount of a detrimental substance elicits protection against later doses. Ideker says it&apos;s rather like when a mild amount of sun every day gives you a healthy tan, which then helps you from getting burned later. In his experiment, exposure of yeast to a small amount of oxidative stress activated a gene that led to the cell stopping more free radicals entering.  His next step is to identify similar pathways in human cells. This research may allow the development of drugs to prevent damaging amounts of ROS entering cells. However, he is cautious at this early stage: &quot;If the pathway works along similar lines in humans and if it can be manipulated as in yeast, then one can imagine very useful therapeutic possibilities relating to cancer and ageing.&quot; So, if taking antioxidants doesn&apos;t work and a small amount of oxidative stress is good, does eating fruit and veg really work? &quot;Despite decades of research, it is currently impossible to state what, if any, contribution is made to the health-promoting effects of fruits and vegetables by the antioxidants present,&quot; says Halliwell. Nevertheless, advice to eat vegetables is still sound; even if they are not combating oxidative stress, they still contain other essential vitamins and minerals, and are high in fibre as well as low in fat. And encouragingly, sales of fruit and veg are currently increasing faster than sales of vitamin supplements, which means that this message is at last getting through."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/25/osama-bin-laden-capture", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s just a small number of specialists that can detect and track down individuals, and the specialist intelligence personnel and the elite special forces were all sent from the Afghan theatre to Iraq,&quot; says Rohan Gunaratna, an expert on international terrorism based in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-06-24T23:01:00Z", "title": "Julian Borger and Declan Walsh: Osama bin Laden is believed to be in these mountains.

That is the one thing that can be said about Osama bin Laden these days with any degree of certainty. At least, he was still alive at the beginning of the month, when an audio tape was delivered to al-Jazeera bearing words in a familiar voice. The tape, aired by al-Jazeera on 3 June, is genuine, according to British and US intelligence, and his references to recent events are proof that it is contemporary. It is a muttered sermon, mainly devoted to decrying Barack Obama on the day the new US president arrived in Saudi Arabia on the start of a Middle East tour - to sow &quot;seeds of hatred&quot;, Bin Laden claimed. But that is where the certainty ends, the facts peter out and the guesswork begins. We do not know what he looks like these days. His last 10 messages have been audio only. There has been no video of him since September 2007, and even that raised questions over exactly when it had been made. Bin Laden may be incapacitated by injury or disease - persistent rumours have him suffering from kidney failure - or he may have shorn off his trademark beard and had plastic surgery, for all we know. After all, Radovan Karadzic - until last July, a fellow fugitive on the world&apos;s most-wanted list - managed to live for years in plain view of his fellow countrymen, disguised until his arrest by no more than a bushy white beard and a new-age top-knot. It has been nearly eight years since George Bush declared Bin Laden &quot;wanted, dead or alive&quot; and described his capture as a national priority. Bush is now back in Texas, living a low-profile post-presidential existence. He has been photographed lugging shopping bags around and been heard complaining about picking up his own dog&apos;s droppings. Bin Laden, meanwhile, remains as elusive as ever, despite the billion-dollar, multi-force, multinational, state-of-the-art aerial drone search - the most extensive and expensive manhunt in history. The best guess of the intelligence services in Washington and London is that the 52-year-old Saudi has hidden himself somewhere in the forbidding rocky expanse of North Waziristan, a semi-autonomous tribal region along Pakistan&apos;s border with Afghanistan.  The Afghan frontier, a 1,550-mile stretch of rock and desert, contains other possible boltholes. Captured al-Qaida members have placed him further north in Chitral, a peaceful district amid the high peaks of the Hindu Kush, cut off by snow for four months of the year. That may explain a recent surge in CIA interest in the area. A mysterious new base, believed to be a surveillance station, is under construction near the 13,000ft-high Boroghil Pass, close to the Afghan border. Locals widely believe it to be American-funded. &quot;The building is totally out of proportion to anything else up there,&quot; says local hotelier Siraj ul Mulk, a member of the traditional royal family of Chitral. To discourage visitors, the tourism ministry has stopped issuing trekking passes for the area, and an annual yak polo festival has been cancelled. Ul Mulk says it is plausible that someone such as Bin Laden could hide in the mountain areas of Chitral, but not in the villages. &quot;Very little remains a secret around here. In their books, the British mentioned that you don&apos;t need spies around here because the locals will come and tell you.&quot; In February this year, an academic team at the University of California claimed to have narrowed down the search with the use of satellite imagery and &quot;fundamental principles of geography&quot;. They went as far as to call for a search of three walled compounds in the Kurram tribal area. &quot;If he&apos;s still alive, he honestly could be sitting there right now,&quot; the lead author of the study, Thomas Gillespie, claimed at the time, though it is not clear whether the recommendation has ever been followed. The area the UCLA geography department pinpointed is less than 20km south of Tora Bora, the cave-riddled Afghan mountain where US-led forces thought they had Bin Laden and the remains of al-Qaida pinned down in December 2001, only for him to slip through their grasp and disappear. A last intercepted radio message on 14 December marks the last time the west had a definitive fix on his whereabouts. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to find just one person. Look, it took the Israelis 15 years to find Eichmann,&quot; says Peter Bergen, a journalist, terrorism expert and one of the few westerners to have actually met Bin Laden - he interviewed him in 1997. His personal guess is that the Saudi construction heir turned jihadist has sought sanctuary high up in the Hindu Kush, in Chitral or the nearby Bajaur tribal agency. The general consensus that Bin Laden is hiding along the highland border is in part based on logic and personal history. The terrain is ideal for a fugitive accustomed to deprivation, riddled with crags and caves and vertical rock walls. In satellite pictures, the region looks like silver foil that has been crumpled, then scorched. This is Bin Laden&apos;s comfort zone, where he enjoys the protection of Pashtunwali, the honour code that makes the local tribes fiercely protective of their guests. American and British intelligence think Bin Laden is in North Waziristan, in part because he has particularly good friends there. He has a long history with Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, a pair of formidable warriors whose militant empire stretches from Khost in Afghanistan to Miram Shah in North Waziristan. The links go back to the 80s, when the inexperienced son of a Saudi millionaire teamed up with the Haqqanis to fight the jihad against Soviet troops occupying Afghanistan. Bin Laden built his first base - the &quot;Lion&apos;s Den&quot; - on Haqqani turf. There are scraps of intelligence to suggest that he has returned to these jihadist roots. Captured al-Qaida members have pointed to the remote mountain passes and recalled sightings, or rumours of sightings. Vincent Cannistraro, a former head of operations in the CIA&apos;s counter-terrorism centre, says there have been several intelligence reports that Bin Laden was in North Waziristan or nearby, &quot;although none of the information is &apos;real time&apos; ... It&apos;s always: &apos;He was there, but we&apos;re not sure today,&apos;&quot; Cannistraro says. The CIA has claimed that its intelligence has been good enough to pick off other senior al-Qaida figures. A Washington Post report earlier this month quoted US and Pakistani officials as claiming that half the 20 &quot;high-value targets&quot; on the American hit list had been killed by Predator and Reaper drone aircraft armed with Hellfire missiles. But the missiles have also killed dozens of Pakistani civilians, deepening resentment of the faceless foreign presence in the sky. Yet despite all the missiles rained down on the tribal areas, the US has never claimed to have even come close to Bin Laden himself. It is as if he represents another level of difficulty as a target. &quot;He and the senior al-Qaida leadership have become incredibly cautious. They have no affinity for any kind of technology. They use couriers to send messages,&quot; says Seth Jones, a US counter-terrorism expert who has just written a book about the Afghan war entitled In the Graveyard of Empires. &quot;Pashtunwali makes it an extremely hard network to penetrate. You need information, and that means capturing people who know his mode of operations. That is a really small number of people.&quot; A western diplomat with access to intelligence in Islamabad explains the limitations of a hi-tech manhunt. &quot;The impressive stuff you see in the movies does exist,&quot; he says, describing the ability to watch live satellite feeds of attacks on remote compounds. &quot;But that technology can only be deployed for limited periods of time and depends on obtaining good, timely information. That&apos;s much harder to come by.&quot; There are also political limitations. Pakistan&apos;s Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has strong historical linkages with Bin Laden&apos;s North Waziristan protectors, the Haqqani network. The ISI considers Haqqani a useful tool: last summer, US officials accused the Pakistani spies of working with him to bomb the Indian embassy in Kabul. And so, while Pakistani officials agree that Bin Laden is on the border, they tend to argue he is on the Afghan side. Bin Laden&apos;s recent preference for producing audio tapes rather than videos could be testament to his risk-averse nature. Video cameras could require another set of hands and eyes, and the setting and his appearance could give away minute clues. Bin Laden has been helped by the fact that his pursuers have frequently been distracted and cautious. At Tora Bora, in the last days of 2001, Washington ignored the advice of US agents and officers on the ground and relied on local allied militias to block the escape route of al-Qaida survivors into Pakistan. They failed. Soon afterwards, America&apos;s robot Predators and human manhunters were dispatched on another assignment, to Iraq. &quot;It&apos;s just a small number of specialists that can detect and track down individuals, and the specialist intelligence personnel and the elite special forces were all sent from the Afghan theatre to Iraq,&quot; says Rohan Gunaratna, an expert on international terrorism based in Singapore. &quot;If that had not happened the world would have celebrated Osama bin Laden&apos;s death or capture.&quot; Attempts were made late in the Bush presidency to focus efforts once more on tracking down Bin Laden. The CIA relaunched the manhunt in an operation codenamed Cannonball in 2006, sending dozens of agents to Pakistan. But the initiative was paralysed from the start by internal disagreements over whether and when to send special forces into the tribal areas on raids. Last year, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon had drawn up new orders to dispatch special forces units into the tribal areas, but that the final green light was never given because of continued infighting in the last months of the Bush administration. The election of Barack Obama and his administration&apos;s focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan has led to another attempt at making a fresh start. According to British and American sources, the new manhunt is a joint venture between special forces and the CIA, under CIA direction, and built around information-sharing with a select group of officials from Pakistan&apos;s ISI, long suspected of being infiltrated by jihadist sympathisers. It will continue to be spearheaded by unmanned Predators and Reapers, with special forces teams on constant standby should &quot;actionable intelligence&quot; become suddenly available. Meanwhile, it is hoped that the Pakistani army will somehow flush Bin Laden out in ground operations with the help of US intelligence. Last week, the troops were sent into South Waziristan, against Baitullah Mehsud, a Taliban leader also suspected of ties to al-Qaida.  But even if the hunters get lucky and capture or kill Bin Laden (the latter is widely considered to be more likely - his bodyguards are reputedly under orders to kill him rather than let him be captured), would it make us any safer? David Benest, a former officer in the Parachute Regiment who served as a British counter-insurgency adviser in Kabul last year, says it would serve little purpose. &quot;He is in a long line of Muslim philosophers/propagandists that stretches back over centuries and it is his ideas that need to be attacked and destroyed rather than himself per se,&quot; Benest argues. &quot;Any action is bound to merely increase antipathy against the &apos;Satanic west&apos;. The UK aim is very clear - to stop him and al-Qaida coming back into Afghanistan, and the hope that the Pakistanis will deal with him. I agree with that.&quot; Most al-Qaida watchers believe that Ayman al-Zawahiri and another Egyptian, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, alias Sheikh Saeed, have taken over the day-to-day running of al-Qaida&apos;s operations, with Bin Laden elevated to an inspirational figurehead role. But the Obama administration clearly believes there is still a point in going after the figurehead, and Bergen, now working as an analyst at the New America Foundation in Washington, agrees. &quot;I think it would make a difference,&quot; Bergen says. &quot;To the extent that the jihadists have a leader, it is him. The fact that jihadists are turning up in Somalia has a lot to do with him saying they should go. There is a relationship between what he says and what these people do.

Barring a spectacular U-turn by the IRB Council on 28 July, England will stage the 2015 event with Japan earning the nod for 2019. The tournament has not been held in England since 1991, when the hosts reached the final, but the recommendation of the Rugby World Cup Ltd board is based squarely on financial necessity. The Rugby Football Union is adamant it can generate more revenue for the global game than its main rivals, Italy and South Africa, and it will be a considerable surprise if the IRB council does not vote accordingly. It also increases the chances of Britain hosting the three biggest sporting events in the world inside seven years, with the Football Association&apos;s campaign to host the 2018 World Cup also ongoing. The government hopes the 2012 Olympics will kick-start a &quot;Decade of Sport&quot; and has agreed to underwrite part of the \u00a380m tournament fee the RFU must guarantee in 2015. It will also provide all security outside the stadiums. Wembley, Anfield, Old Trafford and the Emirates Stadium are all scheduled to host games, with the final to be played at Twickenham. A recent independent report suggested that hosting a Rugby World Cup would be worth \u00a32.1bn to the national economy and the RFU chairman, Martyn Thomas, believes staging the tournament in England will also benefit smaller rugby nations: &quot;When we presented to the council in May we said that in the current difficult economic environment we could deliver a low-risk, high-return tournament that would leave a lasting legacy for the global game. We are truly excited about the opportunity to host the world&apos;s third largest sporting tournament and fervently hope the recommendation is accepted in July.&quot; A vote for England would also give the IRB the necessary platform to push the game into new Asian markets. Japan were bitterly disappointed not to win the vote to stage the 2011 tournament, but should now get their opportunity. &quot;The RWCL Board believes a Rugby World Cup in Japan would provide a gateway to the further development and expansion of the game in Asia, reaching out to new young fans and providing a superb spectacle for the sport,&quot; said the World Cup chairman, Bernard Lapasset. The RWCL board has insisted, however, that future tournaments should be staged in just one country &quot;unless compelling reasons can be presented&quot;. Japan are keen to split one pool between Hong Kong and Singapore, while England want to use the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The RFU and WRU are both confident an acceptable solution can be found."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/03/soldiers-defend-vikings-helmand-deaths", "sentences": ["Announcing the move in the Commons in December, Gordon Brown said \u00a3150m would be spent buying the new tracked personnel carriers from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-03T11:28:42Z", "title": "Former officers defend Viking vehicles as Helmand deaths are investigated", "tags": ["Military", "Defence policy", "Foreign policy", "Afghanistan", "Taliban", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "Former army officers have today defended the decision to deploy Viking vehicles to southern Afghanistan as the Ministry of Defence began investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths of a senior commander and a soldier. Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe and Trooper Joshua Hammond were killed yesterday when their armoured Viking track vehicle was blown up by a &quot;huge&quot; bomb as their convoy was heading for Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province. The Viking cross-country vehicles are due to be replaced in Afghanistan by more than 100 new, larger and more heavily armoured tracked vehicles to be known as Warthogs, while a further 100 Jackal all-terrain vehicles will also be purchased. As attention focused on the Vikings, former officers defended their use and suggested that military planners have been surprised by the size of the bombs and mines the Taliban now have in their arsenal. &quot;You have to remember that Vikings were deployed to fill a very specific function,&quot; said Amyas Godfrey, a former infantry officer and fellow of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, referring to the bridges and canals of the &quot;green zone&quot; along the Helmand river. The Viking is a tracked vehicle, unlike the heavier Mastiff armoured troop carrier. &quot;You are sacrificing mobility for protection but mobility is itself a form of protection&quot;, said Godfrey. He said even the Mastiff had been vulnerable to roadside bombs. Charles Heyman, a military consultant and former infantry officer, said it was impossible to judge decisions and the circumstances surrounding the colonel&apos;s death. The MoD said the Warthogs will not be delivered until next year because they have to undergo trials and be fitted with British &quot;subsystems&quot;. The Viking was introduced into Afghanistan three years ago, but last year the MoD admitted it had reached the limit of how much it could be armoured following a number of deaths involving roadside bombs. It is due to be replaced by the new Warthog vehicle next year. Announcing the move in the Commons in December, Gordon Brown said \u00a3150m would be spent buying the new tracked personnel carriers from Singapore. The Bronco, as it is called, will be converted into armoured, all-terrain vehicles and renamed Warthog. The carrier can travel through water and hold up to 14 troops. Brown said at the time that the Warthog would provide &quot;improved protection for our forces&quot;. In another move to counter the threat of roadside bombs, a new class of mine-clearing vehicles \u2013 including the Buffalo mine-protected vehicle \u2013 is also being developed. The army&apos;s Snatch Land Rovers, which have been particularly vulnerable to attack, are also to be upgraded to a new variant \u2013 Snatch Vixen \u2013 with more power and better protection. The first of the new vehicles should be ready to be deployed by the end of next year. There have been a number of deaths involving Viking armoured vehicles in Afghanistan. Last month, the Grimsby district coroner, Paul Kelly, praised the MoD for identifying a problem with the vehicle and taking steps to solve it after hearing that Trooper Robert Pearson, from the Queen&apos;s Royal Lancers regiment, was killed when driving a vehicle hit by an improvised explosive device in Helmand on 21 April last year. In January, an inquest heard that armour to combat mines was being flown out to Afghanistan to be added to the military vehicles following the death of a Royal Marine. The move came after Corporal Damian Mulvihill, of 40 Commando Royal Marines, was killed in an explosion while travelling in the front seat of a Viking on 20 February last year in Helmand. Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Teare, of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, told a hearing in Plymouth that the MoD expected all 50 vehicles being used in Afghanistan to be fitted with new armour after numerous &quot;mine strikes&quot; prompted urgent requests for the undercarriages to be reinforced. Teare said the Viking was initially designed to defend small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades and therefore most of the armour was on the top of the vehicle."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jul/05/my-lions-tour-highlights", "sentences": ["Let&apos;s face it, we all know it&apos;s not going to happen.&quot; Three suggestions for 2013 1) Play two games in Asia (Tokyo, Hong Kong or Singapore) on the way out to Australia."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-05T10:35:32Z", "title": "My Lions tour highlights | Robert Kitson", "tags": ["Lions Tour 2009", "South Africa rugby team", "Rugby union", "Sport", "British & Irish Lions"], "article": "Best match The second Test at Loftus Versfeld was one of the classic Lions encounters.

He&apos;s not here. We&apos;re just going to have to deal with it. All there&apos;s left is the greatest player of all time attempting to win a record 15th grand slam in his 20th grand-slam final. Yawn.  Play is scheduled to start at 2pm, and unless A-Rod brings his A-Serve to C-Court, like he did on Friday afternoon, it will finish around 3.30pm. This is Federer&apos;s seventh straight Wimbledon final, which is utterly preposterous.  But Roddick has been the form player in SW19 this past fortnight. Consider: Federer hasn&apos;t had a match worthy of the name yet; Roddick, meanwhile, has put the immense Andy Murray to the sword, and done for the irrepressible Lleyton Hewitt to boot. So providing his chops are up, and he regularly hits the T with those spectacular first serves, this could prove a tense tussle. Especially if the first set goes to a tie-break, which Roddick, boasting a shootout record this year of 348-0, will surely win. Even with Fed on the other side of the net. THIS IS ON!  However, if you&apos;re still pining for poor old Murray, here&apos;s some Andy action courtesy of Observer and Guardian tennis guru Steve Bierley: why it&apos;s do-or-die time for Murray at the slams. Lummee.  Incidentally, here&apos;s the PATENTED DAN MASKELL MEMORIAL OH-I-SAY-O-METER\u00ae\u2122\u00ae\u2122\u00ae explained for anyone who has trouble processing simple information: Between 1927 and 1939, football matches on BBC Radio were described by two commentators. One provided a running description of play. The other followed the ball, and depending on its position on the pitch, called out numbers which corresponded to a grid printed in the Radio Times. It was a perfectly logical system, and it&apos;s one we&apos;ve tweaked - OK, nicked - for the tennis. It&apos;s the greatest leap forward in sports commentary for 82 years, and it&apos;s been designed to improve our service to you, not to make life easier for any lazy Game By Game hacks.  OK, so let&apos;s get in the mood:             This is tennis.  Federer is, of course, hawking tat for charity at the OFFICIAL ROGER FEDERER SHOP. And, after he lost his luggage at Heathrow Terminal 5 upon landing for this year&apos;s championships, he eschewed the pricy SW19 boutiques and decided to replenish his wardrobe at the local Oxfam instead. What a guy. Maybe for his next trick he can persuade Gillette to drop the ludicrous price of razor blades?  &quot;They have played each other 20 times. They&apos;re both serving extremely well. It&apos;s gonna be about Roddick&apos;s returns on second serves.&quot; So says Larry Stefanki, coach of Andy Roddick. He&apos;s really talking this up. Both players walk through the pine-heavy halls of Centre Court, ready to take the stage - and the crowd erupt as they wander out onto the turf, Roddick sporting his trademark cap, Roger those roomy leisure breeks. &quot;Rather in the way that Mick Jagger eventually got bored of waking up next to Jerry Hall every morning, has anyone else become ever so slightly bored of King Roger&apos;s perfect gracefulness?&quot; asks Gary Naylor, who has binned all his premium bongo and subscribed to Richard Desmond Weekly. &quot;Both the men&apos;s and women&apos;s games suffer from a surfeit of orthodoxy - wouldn&apos;t it be great to see something different soon?&quot; A British winner?  Coin toss: Roger calls heads. It&apos;s tails. Roddick decides to serve first.  Celebrities in the crowd: Woody Allen. Russell Crowe. Er... some royal goon with a beard who looks vaguely like Alexei Sayle. On the subject of famous folk, Andy Murray was asked the other day whether he was pleased to see Kate Winslet in the Royal Box. &quot;I suppose so,&quot; he shrugged, trying his best to maintain interest but eventually failing dismally. &quot;I guess it keeps kids interested and makes tennis cool, because cool seems to be what&apos;s important in this country.&quot; The disdain at the question was palpable. You have got to love Murray.  First set: Roddick* 1-0 Federer. Well that was a quick, easy start. A couple of aces for the big man.  First set: Roddick 1-1 Federer*. Federer nets a weak forehand into the net, but then bangs down a couple of aces. I can see the way this is going to go.  First set: Roddick* 2-1 Federer. A gorgeous backhand down the line from Roddick here. We saw that a few times against Murray the other day. A couple more big serves, and we&apos;re done. Pete Sampras wanders into the Royal Box at the end of the game, waves to the crowd, and is given a huge ovation for his trouble.  First set: Roddick 2-2 Federer*. Bang. Ace. Bang. Ace. Roddick challenges one of them. It&apos;s a ridiculous challenge, the ball well in, but at least it mixes things up. This is a bit of a tedious start, with both men serving very well indeed, 80% of the first serves going in.  First set: Roddick* 3-2 Federer. A couple of rallies! Roddick wins the pick, a lengthy exchange ending with a lovely cross-court forehand, H to C on the OH-I-SAY-O-METER\u00ae\u2122\u00ae\u2122\u00ae. Then he delivers a beautiful passing shot down the line, G to A. Federer will be happy to have got a few of those big serves back, though.  First set: Roddick 3-3 Federer*. Roddick is really making this backhand work, whistling one past Federer&apos;s nose, OH-I-SAY-O-METER\u00ae\u2122\u00ae\u2122\u00ae B to E. But yet again Federer responds to going 0-15 down with a few big serves. Six games, six drama-free non-events.  First set: Roddick* 4-3 Federer. Roddick comes to the net and looks to have done for Federer with a lovely drop shot at a tight angle, D to E. But Federer comes racing into the net himself and pings the ball down the line to leave the American beaten all ends up. That&apos;s the first point of the game, but like Roddick before him, Federer can&apos;t build on the first point against the serve.  First set: Roddick 4-4 Federer*. The BBC have just shown a fascinating tape, merging film of two Federer service points and running them simultaneously. Federer&apos;s toss and contact with the ball are exactly the same - yet the service goes to the opposite corners of the box. Amazing disguise. He&apos;s won 97% of his service games in this championship so far, though that stat may now have changed after wrapping this one up to 15.  First set: Roddick* 5-4 Federer. Not one in-road has been made on either serve. This is tedious. This is killing tennis. This is what happens when you let Pete Sampras loose on Centre Court.  First set: Roddick 5-5 Federer*. Three big returns by Roddick here, but all are a waste of time. The first sees a rally end with his loose shot down the line that sails out of play. The second is right at Federer&apos;s feet but the ball hits the frame of the Swiss player&apos;s racquet and dinks over the net. The third is whipped straight back past his lugs. Finally a big serve sees Federer hold the game to love.  First set: Roddick* 6-5 Federer. Now it&apos;s Federer&apos;s turn to return a couple of big serves. Roddick finds himself 0-30 down, brings it back to 30-30, but nets a weak backhand into the net after a long rally to gift Federer the first break point of the match. Roddick hits a brilliant deep second serve which Federer returns long, saving the game. Federer earns another three break points, Roddick netting a couple of weak forehands, Federer hitting a majestic one of his own G to A. But he can&apos;t convert any of them, though Roddick requires the help of Hawkeye twice as Federer hits forehands millimetres too deep. Eventually Roddick booms a couple of big serves down to see the game out. Will Federer rue those four break points squandered? He&apos;s got to serve to stay in the set now.  RODDICK WINS THE FIRST SET! First set: Roddick 7-5 Federer*. Wow! This came from nowhere. Roddick was obviously taking notes from Murray on Friday, because he hits one of the Scot&apos;s trademark whipped cross-court forehands from miles outside the court on the right, H to C. The audacity of the shot unsettles Federer, who hits the next point long, then misses an easy volley, sending the ball wide left of court with Roddick stranded. Roddick suddenly has a set point, and he wraps it up by moving Federer left then right, pushing him deeper and deeper until the 14-slam champion sends a forehand sailing wide left down the line. Pete Sampras&apos; grin is as wide as the Royal Box.  Second set: Roddick* 1-0 Federer; Roddick leads by one set to love. Ping, tok, thwack, whack. &quot;There&apos;s a difference between orthodoxy and virtuosity,&quot; muses a philosophical David Wall, typing with one hand, stroking his jazz beard with the other. &quot;You might get bored of watching Paul Collingwood hit a copybook cover drive but you never tire of Michael Vaughan (early career) doing the same. Ditto tiring of Federer on form (mutatis mutandis).&quot;  Second set: Roddick 1-1 Federer*; Roddick leads by one set to love. Ping, tok, thwack, whack pt II.  Second set: Roddick* 2-1 Federer; Roddick leads by one set to love. Well that first set shows how even the great players fall to pieces at the business end of a set. Roddick nearly did, being forced to four break points, then Federer crumbled. Yet now, when the pressure is (relatively) off in the early stages of this set, the serves are whistling in again.  Second set: Roddick 2-2 Federer*; Roddick leads by one set to love. And again with the big serves. Could we ask them to start each set at 5-5?  Second set: Roddick* 3-2 Federer; Roddick leads by one set to love. CTRL + C, CTRL + V.  Second set: Roddick 3-3 Federer*; Roddick leads by one set to love. Aces =/= entertainment.  Second set: Roddick* 4-3 Federer; Roddick leads by one set to love. Aces. More of them. I feel like I&apos;m short-changing you here, but I&apos;m really not sure what I can say about this.  Second set: Roddick 4-4 Federer*; Roddick leads by one set to love. There&apos;s a wee sniff for Roddick as Federer hits a slow second serve at 0-15 down, but the American misses the chance to hit a passing winner, and Federer serves out the rest of the game in a fashion best described as drama-free.  Second set: Roddick* 5-4 Federer; Roddick leads by one set to love. Roddick is serving brilliantly, hammering the ball straight at Federer&apos;s body, making it very difficult for the Swiss to return. When he&apos;s not hammering the ball straight into Federer&apos;s tits, he&apos;s hitting the T of the service boxes, unreturnable aces. Surely Federer won&apos;t crumble on his serve at the crunch again?  Second set: Roddick 5-5 Federer*; Roddick leads by one set to love. Federer almost hits a forehand long on the first point. Roddick sends it whistling into the net but challenges it; however, it&apos;s in, and the point is Federer&apos;s. The five-time champ double-faults at 30-15, leaving Roddick two points away from a two-set lead, but Federer wins the next point, then an amazing 23-stroke rally which ends with Federer dispatching a Roddick drop shot with a magical dink, E to D. Point of the match, without question.  Second set: Roddick* 6-5 Federer; Roddick leads by one set to love. &quot;Here in Norway, NRK lost the feed from Wimbledon at 6-5 to Roddick and came back just when he&apos;d broken Federer and won the set,&quot; reports Steven Johnson. &quot;All these acey acey serves, and we miss the one game of drama. I just wanted to share my pain.&quot; Hopefully it went down again for a minute or two there, to spare you that eye-bleedingly dull service game. Mind you, Roddick won&apos;t mind if things keep going like this. Apart from that one game at 5-5 in the first, Federer hasn&apos;t caused him any problems on his serve at all.  Second set: Roddick 6-6 Federer*; Roddick leads by one set to love. Before this game, Federer had only hit 59% of his first serves in. An ace and a couple of big serves here should have bumped that up a bit. Roddick, meanwhile, is up at 79%. Wow. Federer has won 16 out of 19 tiebreaks in slam finals; he&apos;ll need this one.  FEDERER WINS THE SECOND-SET TIE-BREAK 8-6! Second set: Roddick 6-7 Federer; set score 1-1. WHAT A CHOKE BY RODDICK, WHO SPURNS FOUR SET POINTS. Here&apos;s how the whole sorry saga unfolded... Roddick bangs down a 143mph serve to set the template. Federer isn&apos;t quite as confident on his own serve, immediately shedding a mini-break. Roddick bangs down another couple of massive serves to go 4-1 up. Then it&apos;s 5-1 as yet another Federer first serve hits the net, allowing Roddick to attack the second serve and move his opponent around the court before delivering a killer blow down the line, G to A. A deep forehand followed by a crisp volley at the net gives Roddick four set points. Brilliance from Roddick. And then... The first is saved by Federer with a beautiful cross-court backhand dinked over the net, E to D. The second and third are saved without fuss on his own serve. And then - outrageously - Roddick misses an easy volley at the net, ballooning a backhand MILES out of court, D to a long way beyond E. WHAT AN EEJIT. Roddick then shanks Federer&apos;s return off the rim of his racquet, amazingly giving Federer the set point. And he needs only one. I&apos;ll be surprised if the American comes back from that body blow. That was the mother and father of All Chokes: (Doug Sanders + Jimmy White) x (AC Milan + Jana Novotna) on the end of a stick whittled by Scott Norwood.  Third set: Roddick 0-1 Federer*; set score 1-1. Roddick looks shellshocked. And depressed.  Third set: Roddick* 1-1 Federer; set score 1-1. Roddick still looks shellshocked. And depressed. He picks it up bravely, serving out easily to 15. Why couldn&apos;t he do that in the tie-break?  Third set: Roddick 1-2 Federer*; set score 1-1. Roddick is in turmoil, his soul in torment. This is painful to watch. Four set points, though.  Third set: Roddick* 2-2 Federer; set score 1-1. Again with the easy serves, as Roddick bravely gathers himself and wins his service game to love. WHY COULDN&apos;T HE DO THAT, JUST ONCE, WHEN TWO MINI-BREAKS UP IN THE SECOND-SET DECIDER? &quot;In Singapore we have ESPN with Vijay Amritraj commentating,&quot; reports Alan Ryan. &quot;It&apos;s a Federer love-in - genius, record breaker etc - it got so bad he called him The Lord of the Lawns, instinctively I thought he was a bit of a tool, but according to Wiki he&apos;s been in Octopussy, Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home (the one with the whales) and best of all, Hart to Hart. All of which makes him a lot more of a star than Federer.&quot;  Third set: Roddick 2-3 Federer*; set score 1-1. Michael Ballack is in the crowd. Perhaps there&apos;s going to be a post-match ceremony where he hands over the title of World&apos;s Most Hapless Sporting Final Competitor to Roddick.  Third set: Roddick* 3-3 Federer; set score 1-1. At 30-30, Roddick lumps a forehand long. The pressure&apos;s on, but he responds well: he wallops down a massive serve to save the break, then after two deuces puts the game away with a delicious forehand down the line, G to A. &quot;Roddick&apos;s choke wasn&apos;t as prolonged as Novotna but it was just as painful,&quot; suggests Nadir Hassan. If he comes back from that to win this title, it&apos;ll be like five years of Novotna&apos;s life in microcosm.  Third set: Roddick 3-4 Federer*; set score 1-1. This was too easy for Federer.  Third set: Roddick* 4-4 Federer; set score 1-1. Roddick&apos;s been looking strong all fortnight when he comes into the net, and here he puts away a crisp volley at the start of the game to assert himself. He wins the game with minimal fuss. Alex Ferguson is in the crowd, with a big purple face. Must be the sun.      That Volley    Third set: Roddick 4-5 Federer*; set score 1-1. This was easy enough for Federer. Almost as easy as That Volley, as it must now be called.  Third set: Roddick* 5-5 Federer; set score 1-1. Roddick serves to stay in the set. And after letting a 30-0 lead slip to 30-30, he does so magnificently, whistling down a couple of extraordinary boomers under pressure. Can things boom and whistle at the same time?  Third set: Roddick 5-6 Federer*; set score 1-1. Ping, whack, tok, twang. This has been going for two hours, and for the most part like this. Still, what a tie-break. Are we going to get another?  Third set: Roddick* 6-6 Federer; set score 1-1. Yes. Roddick finds himself 15-30 down, but smashes in two huge serves, and we&apos;re off again. If Roddick doesn&apos;t win this upcoming tie-break, he might have a thundering nervous breakdown.  FEDERER WINS THE THIRD-SET TIE-BREAK 7-5! Third set: Roddick 6-7 Federer; Federer leads two sets to one. The first point, on Federer&apos;s serve, goes with service after a rally of medium length. The second, on Roddick&apos;s, also goes to serve, after a long rally. But then Federer goes a mini-break up, Roddick sending a sliced backhand weakly into the net. Federer holds his two service points to move 4-1 up. Roddick then nets a dreadful forehand; as the players cross to change ends, the American&apos;s head is hanging so low it&apos;s a wonder his eyebrows aren&apos;t scraping grooves in the turf. Roddick wins his next service point to make it 5-2, which is where Federer found himself last time round. Can he come back like Federer did? No. Despite saving two set points at 6-3 on his own serve, Roddick is helpless as Federer serves big, then dispatches the return at the net. Perfect serve and volley stuff: the watching Pete Sampras would be proud. If he wasn&apos;t looking so pissed off at the inevitable result of this final, and the loss of his grand-slam record.  Fourth set: Roddick* 1-0 Federer; Federer leads two sets to one. Roddick holds onto his serve, but not without a wee shake at 30-30. Federer lets him off the hook with a couple of loose forehands which fly over the baseline.  Fourth set: Roddick 1-1 Federer*; Federer leads two sets to one. Centre Court is strangely subdued. Perhaps there&apos;s a bit of a hangover from two weeks of Murraymania, but mainly it&apos;s a sense that this is over. Even when Federer serves loosely and gifts Roddick a 15-30 lead, there&apos;s no sense of the American being able to take advantage. Roddick welts a couple of forehands wide and long, and the game is over, the chance gone.  Fourth set: Roddick* 2-1 Federer; Federer leads two sets to one. Having said all that, Roddick has yet to be broken by Federer. Here he serves a game to love. He looks broken, though.  Fourth set: Roddick 3-1 Federer*; Federer leads two sets to one. Roddick looks broken? Pah! Here&apos;s some amazing resistance by a player who was clearly reeling. Dominant play at the net by the American - one point with a delicious volley - earns him two break points. Federer saves the first with a massive ace, but then Roddick wheels out that backhand down the line again, B to H, and the break is won! Roddick almost falls to his knees in jubilation - he clearly considers it, before thinking twice and just jumps around a bit instead. All the frustration over the second set tie-break and That Volley came out right there.  Fourth set: Roddick* 4-1 Federer; Federer leads two sets to one. A brilliant rally at deuce, Roddick ending a long exchange with a deep forehand A to H, before dropping Federer&apos;s return back over the net. The Swiss nearly makes up the ground to dink an outrageous winner E to D, but Roddick&apos;s drop shot was too good and he can&apos;t quite make it. Roddick&apos;s nerve held up well there, allowing him to cement the break earned in the previous game. This final looked totally over, but now? With Centre Court back in voice, IT IS ON!  Fourth set: Roddick 4-2 Federer*; Federer leads two sets to one. Suddenly Roddick is on the front foot. Despite falling 40-0 down, he makes a game of it, whipping a cracking volley up and down, H to A, leaving Federer stranded. Federer serves an ace at 40-30 to win the game, but Roddick looks a different player.  Fourth set: Roddick* 5-2 Federer; Federer leads two sets to one. The nerves jangle for Roddick, who double faults at 30-15. But he wins a Homeric 21-stroke rally at 30-30, whipping the ball to both corners, right on the baseline, eventually running Federer ragged. Then a big ace wraps up the game. He&apos;s four serves from taking this to a fifth-set decider. This is a marvellous response, because it wasn&apos;t too long ago that Roddick looked a shell of a man.  Fourth set: Roddick 5-3 Federer*; Federer leads two sets to one. Roddick takes a huge tumble, going over on both ankles as he slides around. For a second it looks like a heartbreaking end to the match, as he gingerly gets up and limps around, unwilling to put his full weight on his right foot, but eventually he recovers. Phew. That would have been a terrible anti-climax. He gets up and whips an amazing cross-court winner, A to F, though Federer bangs down some big serves to force his opponent to serve out for the set.  RODDICK WINS THE FOURTH SET AND TAKES THE FINAL TO A DRAMATIC FIFTH!!! Fourth set: Roddick* 6-3 Federer; set score 2-2. A crazy forehand down the line, H to B, puts Federer 30-0 up, but Roddick digs deep to bring it back to 30-30. He looks to have lost the next crucial point with a weak prod back to Federer, but amazingly the Swiss duffs a volley into the net. At 40-30 he makes no mistake, and with a pump of the fist he celebrates making it 2-2 in sets. That is an amazing comeback from a player who was in pieces for a set and a bit after That Capitulation.  Fifth set: Roddick 0-1 Federer*; set score 2-2. An easy hold for the five-time champion at the start of the deciding set. &quot;Why doesn&apos;t Federer ever sweat?&quot; wonders John Woodberry. &quot;This must be frustrating for anyone who plays him.&quot;  Fifth set: Roddick* 1-1 Federer; set score 2-2. Federer has had six break points in this match - the sixth coming here - and he hasn&apos;t won a single one. That is an amazing statistic. He&apos;s gifted one here, after a passing shot hit E to D comes off both the rim of his racket and the cord of the net, leaving Roddick flailing, but the American gets up and fizzes down a couple of berzerkers to save the game. &quot;I&apos;m so hoping Roddick takes it,&quot; writes our friend from the USA, Melissa Forbis. &quot;It&apos;s definitely not about patriotism (although the fireworks last night kicked ass here), but Federer&apos;s blandness annoys me.&quot; Can you call a man who shops in Oxfam in pursuit of some Jarvis Cocker chic bland?  Fifth set: Roddick 1-2 Federer*; set score 2-2. This is easy enough for Federer, though he has to rely on Hawkeye to ensure a winner, F to C, counts at 30-15. Roddick does his best to look nonplussed, but it was a mile in and a terrible call.  Fifth set: Roddick* 2-2 Federer; set score 2-2. Wallop, whack, thwack, belabour. A great service game, allowing Roddick to save his energy to attack Federer&apos;s serve.  Fifth set: Roddick 2-3 Federer*; set score 2-2. Wallop, whack, thwack, belabour. A great service game, allowing Federer to save his energy to attack Roddick&apos;s serve. Three aces at this stage, though!  Fifth set: Roddick* 3-3 Federer; set score 2-2. Roddick takes the new balls. He loses the first point played with them, but showcases massive stones by unleashing two mammoth forehands down the line, A to G, to turn the game around. He then wheechs down a 384mph serve to see it out. This is getting tense now.  Fifth set: Roddick 3-4 Federer*; set score 2-2. At the moment it&apos;s hard to see either of these players losing their serve. There, I&apos;ve said it. That&apos;s sure to ruin it for someone.  Fifth set: Roddick* 4-4 Federer; set score 2-2. Roddick bangs a huge ace down the track. Federer refers it to Hawkeye, simply to bugger up Roddick&apos;s rhythm; there can be no other explanation, because the serve is a mile in. The tactic looks to have worked for one point only, until Roddick finds his range again and sees the game through.  Fifth set: Roddick 4-5 Federer*; set score 2-2. Clump, wallop, hoick, wheech. And with that, we reach the point where one slip up for either man will prove curtains.  Fifth set: Roddick* 5-5 Federer; set score 2-2. Wham, bam, slam, zam. Federer has no idea how to return Roddick&apos;s massive serve at the moment. He&apos;ll need to be working it out sometime soon if he&apos;s not to make Pete Sampras a very happy man.  Fifth set: Roddick 5-6 Federer*; set score 2-2. Mind you, Roddick isn&apos;t troubling Federer&apos;s much either.  Fifth set: Roddick* 6-6 Federer; set score 2-2. An outstanding point at 15-0, Roddick somehow getting to an exquisite Federer drop shot and chipping it back over the net, only to see his opponent whip a clever forehand winner C to F. It doesn&apos;t break Roddick, though, the big man hammering down two huge serves, then knocking a delightful passing backhand down the line G to A while on the run at full pelt.  Fifth set: Roddick 6-7 Federer*; set score 2-2. What a point at 30-15, Roddick whipping a nine-times-out-of-ten winner F to C only for Federer to somehow get a racquet onto it and loop the ball back over the net. Roddick charges in and lifts the ball onto the cord, whereupon it topples off and over for the point. From 30-30 though, Federer takes control and sees the game out without too much incident.  Fifth set: Roddick* 7-7 Federer; set score 2-2. Somebody&apos;s serving mechanism has to give way at some point, surely?  Fifth set: Roddick 7-8 Federer*; set score 2-2. A simply outrageous shot by Federer, who lets a ball drop from the sky onto the baseline, then whacks a curving out-then-in forehand down the line, H to B. That was like Roberto Carlos&apos;s famous free kick for Brazil against France in 1997!             Fifth set: Roddick* 8-8 Federer; set score 2-2. This is epic. It really is difficult to see someone dropping their serve at the moment. Both men are pinging them down brilliantly!  Fifth set: Roddick 8-9 Federer*; set score 2-2. A solid return on the first point puts Roddick 15-0 up. Federer booms big to make it 15-15, but then the American plays two spectacularly good points in a row. The first a tenacious rally that ends with Federer walloping a forehand into the net, the next a ridiculous backhand pass up the line, G to A. But Federer is staunch, bringing it back to deuce with a couple of classy serve-and-volley points, then serving the game out. That was as close as we&apos;ve got to a break in this set. Will Roddick rue those two spurned break points?  Fifth set: Roddick* 9-9 Federer; set score 2-2. Federer plays perhaps the worst shot of his entire career, fannying a topspin forehand volley into the net. It was like he wafted at the ball with a wet sheet of toilet paper. Meanwhile Roddick plays one of the best shots of his, dinking a world-class shot over the net, C to F, from close range. That was so delicate, and under intense pressure as well.  Fifth set: Roddick 9-10 Federer*; set score 2-2. Federer looks on the edge at 15-15 on his second serve, but follows up a deep serve with a lovely forehand G to B. He moves 40-15 up, but then falls victim to yet another magnificent Roddick backhand down the line. Federer sees through the game with an ace, though he needs a little help from Hawkeye. The ball looked out to the naked eye - especially Roddick&apos;s, who waves his racquet in the air in disgust.  Fifth set: Roddick* 10-10 Federer; set score 2-2. Once again it&apos;s tense at 15-15, but Roddick zips some delicious balls into both corners of Federer&apos;s court, moving him left then right and back again, forcing him to eventually balloon a forehand out of play. The rest of the game is all too easy for the big-serving American. This final set has now lasted over an hour!  Fifth set: Roddick 10-11 Federer*; set score 2-2. After a preposterously long rally at 15-0, Roddick advances to the net after a drop shot. The shot&apos;s not brilliant, leaving Federer with half a court to slip a winner into, but the Swiss wangs the ball out of play. Unbelievable. It doesn&apos;t cost him, though, as he regroups and hammers down two unreturnable serves, then an ace. Will this match ever end?  Fifth set: Roddick* 11-11 Federer; set score 2-2. The game starts with a long rally. Federer looks like winning it, but sends an easy volley sailing out of play beyond the baseline. A big serve puts Roddick 30-0 up. Federer scrapes a rally. Roddick bangs down another boomer, then misses an easy backhand, D to H, sending the ball sailing wide of the lines. Then another unforced error takes the game to deuce. Federer is two points from the title? Can he convert the situation? Nobody will ever know, because he&apos;s simply not given the chance, Roddick whacking down two unreturnable serves under the most amazing pressure. This is some match, one of the all-time classics. How on earth is anyone going to break?  Fifth set: Roddick 11-12 Federer*; set score 2-2. This was easy for Federer, as near to a non-event as you can get under these circumstances.  Fifth set: Roddick* 12-12 Federer; set score 2-2. This was easy for Roddick, as near to a non-event as you can get under these circumstances.  Fifth set: Roddick 12-13 Federer*; set score 2-2. An amazing point at 15-15, Roddick falling over on the baseline but receiving (rather than proactively winning) the point anyway as Federer unbelievably shanks a terrible volley wide left of court. No matter, Federer wallops three aces down in a row to save the game. &quot;Shoot one of them now, please,&quot; cries Ian Copestake. What&apos;s the point? They&apos;ve both already dodged enough bullets in this match.  Fifth set: Roddick* 13-13 Federer; set score 2-2. Federer wins a spectacular first point with a booming forehand to the corner of Roddick&apos;s deuce court. Roddick moves 40-15 up, but Federer comes right back at him with two massive points to take the American to deuce for the second time in three service games. Roddick doesn&apos;t wilt, though, whacking down an ace, then an unreturnable serve.  Fifth set: Roddick 13-14 Federer*; set score 2-2. After four hours and five minutes, a service game to love. Bloody hell, this is immense.  Fifth set: Roddick* 14-14 Federer; set score 2-2. At 0-15 down and on second serve, Federer wafts a return out of play down the right-hand tramline. Then at 15-15 Roddick completely mishits a volley at the net, the ball travelling less than an inch. Federer is two points away from grand slam No15, but misses a relatively simple passing shot, C to G, then watches Roddick whistle two big serves past his lugs.  Fifth set: Roddick 14-15 Federer*; set score 2-2. Roddick is beginning to look tired, wafting returns into the net. Federer holds to love.  FEDERER WINS AN ABSOLUTE EPIC!!! Fifth set: Roddick* 14-16 Federer; Federer wins by three sets to two. Roddick rocks, going 0-30 down, sending another weak forehand into the net, then slicing another miles into the sky. Three ludicrously sweet serves later, it&apos;s 40-30, but then another tired slice - this time miles out of court on the left - allows Federer to bring him to deuce for the third time in four games. On the second deuce, Roddick reaches the net and hits a terrible forehand far too deep - match point for Federer. And he only needs the one chance, pushing Roddick miles beyond the baseline and forcing the error, a forehand skied miles into the air. Federer is elated, Roddick understandably floored.  &quot;RODDICK! RODDICK! RODDICK!&quot; The crowd scream his name, the chant reaching ear-splitting volume. With tears in his eyes, Roddick acknowledges the crowd. It&apos;s heartbreaking that someone had to lose.  A tearful Roddick picks up his silver salver, then Federer lifts the golden pot. The crowd gives Roddick the greater reception, perhaps mindful that he may never, ever get over That Volley. Poor sod. &quot;I&apos;m one of the lucky few that gets cheered for, so thank you for that,&quot; he tells the crowd, who are loving him so much right now. (He&apos;s lost, this is Britain, you know how it works.) &quot;Sorry Pete, I tried to hold him back,&quot; he quips in the direction of Mr Sampras, who is wearing a fixed rictus. &quot;My head is spinning, it feels funny, tennis is crazy&quot; says Federer, who can hardly speak for smiling. Well, he is the most successful player in the history of the game, after all.  Tableau vivant: Roddick is sitting in his chair, motionless, dead behind the eyes, contemplating deeply existential issues."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2009/jul/07/ie-security-flaw", "sentences": ["Today, McAfee reported a new variant appearing in queries from &quot;Korea, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and the US in very small numbers&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-07T22:54:31Z", "title": "Zero-day IE vulnerability hits China, and starts spreading", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Windows", "Data and computer security", "Technology"], "article": "Microsoft has published a Security Advisory (972890) for an unpatched flaw in a Video ActiveX Control that was being exploited in China as long ago as June 11.

The plan was intended to produce a new generation of global communicators, but government officials say it has stalled attainment and exposed a dearth of teachers able to deliver classes in English. Education minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced last Wednesday that the English-medium education policy introduced across the country in 2003, known as PPSMI, would be phased out from 2012. He said that evidence gathered during a year-long assessment and public consultation had convinced the government that PPSMI wasn&apos;t working, and that the dominance of English in the curriculum risked undermining students&apos; grasp of their first language. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a complete failure but it has not achieved the desired objectives that it was supposed to achieve,&quot; Muhyiddin told a press conference. &quot;The government is convinced that science and maths need to be taught in a language that will be easily understood by students, which is Bahasa Malay in national schools, Mandarin in Chinese schools and Tamil in Tamil schools.&quot; But supporters of the policy \u00adexpressed dismay, calling the decision a lost opportunity for Malaysia to emulate the economic success of English-speaking Singapore, held up as an example of how language skills can be a key to a connecting local workers and industries to the global economy. The Parents Action Group for Education (Page), which had campaigned to maintain PPSMI, said the change would be unfair on many parents. &quot;There might be some schools which would want to continue teaching in English,&quot; Page chairman Azimah Abdul Rahim told the New Straits Times newspaper. &quot;I think there should be a choice. There are many Malaysians whose first language is English.&quot; The use of English for teaching in class has been a politically charged \u00adissue since it was decreed by Malaysia&apos;s autocratic prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, months before he stood down from office in 2003.  Since he was a staunch nationalist during his 22 years in power, Mahatir&apos;s move was a surprise acknowledgement that the post-independence policy he had championed of promoting Malay identity and downgrading the country&apos;s anglophone colonial past had been a mistake.  English-medium teaching was phased out of most schools by the 1970s. As a result the economy stagnated and Malaysia needed to develop a workforce skilled in the language of commerce and technology if it was to catch up with its south-east Asian competitors, he argued. Many schools struggled from the start to deliver maths and science lessons in English, but the promise of future economic gains, and enthusiasm among parents, particularly in urban areas, for their children to acquire \u00adbetter English helped to maintain government commitment to the policy.  But in more recent years few have been able to ignore an emerging skills gap between urban and rural schools as education authorities outside the major cities failed to find enough staff able to teach in English. Meanwhile, government opponents have fanned nationalist fears by claiming that Malay culture was being undermined by PPSMI. In 2008 the government responded to growing pressure by setting up a review of PPSMI, and an expert panel delivered its report to ministers in January, but a decision was stalled until after parliamentary elections in April.  In March police in Kuala Lumpur used teargas to disperse up to 5,000 ethnic Malays who took to the streets to voice their opposition to the policy. In his statement, Muhyiddin denied that the government had bowed to political pressure, stressing instead that the decision had been taken on the basis of educational results alone.  He claimed these showed that the students who had been taught maths and science in \u00adEnglish since they started primary school were now performing less well in those subjects in national exams than previous cohorts. He said the percentage of students who achieved grade A to C for science had dropped by 2.5% in urban schools and 3% in rural schools. For maths, the results had fallen by around 4% in both urban and rural schools. He added that only 8% of teachers were using English exclusively in classes while the use of Bahasa Malay was still common, particularly in rural areas, with on average just over half of PPSMI teaching time being delivered in English. English-medium instruction will be phased out from schools from 2012 and the focus shifted to teaching \u00adEnglish in separate language classes alongside improved Bahasa Malay teaching, Muhyiddin said.He said that up to 14,000 English language teachers would be recruited by 2012, as well as specialist teaching assistants. English language teaching time will be increased by up to 30% a week, Muhyiddin added. However, some critics were sceptical that qualified teaching staff can be found. &quot;What has not occurred to the authorities is that the education system requires very competent teachers,&quot; Khoo Kay Kim, emeritus professor at the University of Malaya&apos;s history department, told the Reuters news agency. Meanwhile, the still influential architect of PPSMI was quick to rally support for his policy. The octogenarian Dr Mahathir is using his popular blog to canvass opinion. &quot;I am not surprised over the disappointment and even anger towards the government&apos;s decision ... Seems to me like the government is not listening to the voice of the people,&quot; he wrote.  Within hours of putting up his online poll, 40,000 people had \u00adresponded with a resounding 84% opposed to the changes."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/10/newcastle-united-takeover-steve-mcmahon", "sentences": ["Steve McMahon said that the Singapore-based investment company, The Profitable Group, has submitted a bid for the newly relegated club.", "&quot;We&apos;ve had a bid in and it&apos;s under serious consideration,&quot; McMahon told Singapore&apos;s Straits Times."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-10T16:30:55Z", "title": "Steve McMahon consortium has lodged bid to buy Newcastle United from Mike Ashley", "tags": ["Newcastle United", "Alan Shearer", "Mike Ashley", "Championship", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "With any takeover of Newcastle United unlikely to materialise until next week at the very earliest, one potential buyer did at least break cover today.

A handsome pair, &quot;Serge and Elina&quot; from New Jersey sashayed across a stage in a YouTube clip of a ballroom dancing competition last year. A second online video tells the story of their romance, as Serge, a lonely workaholic, polishes a magic lamp to find a genie who conjures up the wife of his dreams. But Sergey Aleynikov, a highly successful 39-year-old computer programmer with dual Russian and American citizenship, is not all he seems, according to US authorities. The FBI has accused him of pulling off the hi-tech equivalent of an audacious, safe-cracking heist. He is charged with stealing software at the core of Goldman Sachs&apos;s electronic trading platform - a secret formula that gives the bank its competitive edge. Aleynikov, says his lawyer, is one of the top technology geeks on Wall Street. Employed for two years at Goldman, he was on a salary of $400,000 (\u00a3248,000) until a Chicago start-up, Teza Technologies, poached him in early June with an offer to triple his pay. Defence counsel Sabrina Shroff told the Observer: &quot;Only about 100 people in the world can do what Mr Aleynikov can do. He&apos;s a very marketable man.&quot; Aleynikov, who was arrested at Newark airport, New Jersey on 3 July, is accused of squirrelling away highly sensitive software through his computers at Goldman, and of uploading confidential code to a file-sharing server based in Germany. At a hearing in which a judge granted Aleynikov bail on a $750,000 surety, prosecutor Joseph Facciponte described the information in question as Goldman&apos;s &quot;proprietary, high-quantity, high-volume trading platform with which they conduct all of their trades in all major markets within the United States and other places&quot;.  Facciponte told the judge: &quot;They guard the secrecy of this code very strictly,&quot; explaining that it draws information from stockmarkets in &quot;milliseconds&quot; to power sophisticated, highly profitable, automatic dealing. &quot;It is something which they had spent millions upon millions of dollars developing over the past number of years, and it&apos;s something which provides them with many millions of dollars of revenue.&quot; According to the FBI&apos;s complaint, Aleynikov logged on to Goldman&apos;s systems on at least four occasions during his last few days before quitting the bank, to copy, compress, merge and encrypt parts of this core code. One of these sessions took place after 11pm. He uploaded 32MB of information to an external website, then allegedly attempted to cover his tracks by unsuccessfully trying to erase his &quot;bash history&quot; - a record of activity automatically stored by the bank. Goldman picked up irregularities through its sweeping systems, which routinely monitor employee email for unusual activity.  Experts say the case underlines the challenge facing the financial industry as it struggles to protect proprietary information in a world where data can be transferred at the touch of the button, even on handheld devices. Contrary to popular perception, external hackers are not the primary security threat to banks. Around 60% of data breaches are by disgruntled, or greedy, employees, according to a study by the consultancy firm Celent. In 132 reported intrusions in the two years to February 2008, banks lost an average of $250,000 each time. Jacob Jegher, an IT security specialist at Celent, points out: &quot;From the outside, there are numerous knocks on the door but few successful entries. But for those who work inside a bank, the door is already open.&quot; Banks face a delicate task in monitoring employees&apos; activity without making staff feel distrusted by a &quot;Big Brother&quot; regime. Most workers on Wall Street or in London&apos;s Square Mile are well aware that their phone calls can be recorded by their firms&apos; compliance departments and that their emails are subject to scrutiny. Any external transfers of large data files send red flags shooting skywards. &quot;There is no bank, or any other corporation that I can think of, that will tell you it&apos;s acceptable to take a corporate asset and transfer it to a personal computer,&quot; says Jegher. &quot;Generally speaking, you can&apos;t do that.&quot; He adds, though, that such breaches are increasingly hard to police. Mobile phones are routinely banned on trading floors - for good reason: &quot;You could use it to snatch a photo of a screen and send it to somebody via a picture message.&quot; Aleynikov, a father of three, lives in the New Jersey town of Little Falls and drives a 2006 Honda Odyssey minivan. He was a programmer with Russia&apos;s ministry of transportation before emigrating to the US in 1991, where he initially worked as a teaching assistant in the biomedical engineering department of Rutgers University. A Rutgers professor, Evangelia Micheli-Tzanakou, described him to New Jersey&apos;s Star-Ledger newspaper as &quot;one of the brightest students I ever worked with... He was also ambitious and driven and, by the way, an excellent competitive ballroom dancer.&quot; Aleynikov then joined a telecommunications company, IDT, before moving to Goldman. He is described by friends as having a quiet sense of humour.  His arrest is a huge embarrassment to Aleynikov&apos;s new employer, Teza, a finance outfit founded by three alumni of Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza suspended Aleynikov after just one day&apos;s work last week and made it clear that it knew nothing of his &quot;alleged misconduct&quot;. If Goldman&apos;s code got into the hands of a competitor, experts say the bank could find its most valuable tricks out in the open. But Steve Katz, a former senior security executive who worked at Citigroup, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, says implementing a rival bank&apos;s trading system is not easy: &quot;Somebody&apos;s going to have to go ahead and reverse-engineer it, figure out exactly what it is, and develop code to do something with it.&quot; While the collaborative culture of the world wide web sometimes encourages developers to throw their programming work open to all, Katz says straightforward theft for money would be unusual: &quot;Investment banks are intensely competitive, but they&apos;re not generally unethical enough to steal somebody else&apos;s code.&quot; Goldman Sachs is saying little about the saga, but the bank&apos;s decision to call in the FBI has enraged Shroff, Aleynikov&apos;s lawyer. She says that although her client uploaded information, he was doing nothing illegal - none of the data was sensitive or shared with outsiders. Plus, she maintains, the code in question was 15 years old and its importance has been grossly overplayed by Goldman. &quot;If it&apos;s that secret a code, if it&apos;s that valuable, surely a man who downloaded it a month ago would have sold it, hawked it by now or shared it by now,&quot; she says. &quot;My client is one of the brightest people imaginable. I hardly think he needs to rely on some antiquated piece of code.&quot; A world of financial scandals The Aleynikov case is not the only one centred around banks, employees and confidential data in recent years: \u2022 In 2008, the FBI accused a financial analyst at the US mortgage lender Countrywide Financial of uploading the personal details of as many as two million home loan applicants. Rene Rebollo denied accessing a company computer outside business hours to steal thousands of account details, which he allegedly sold for $400 or $500 per batch. The case is ongoing. \u2022 Two 20-year employees at Bank of America in Singapore were accused in 2002 of siphoning millions from the dormant accounts of dead foreign clients. The breach was discovered through a routine audit and the scandal prompted the resignation of the firm&apos;s Singapore boss. \u2022 A New Jersey man, Orazio &quot;Ozzy&quot; Lembo, pleaded guilty in 2007 to masterminding a vast insider theft scheme, encompassing 10 banks, in which 676,000 accounts were compromised over four years. Lembo paid staff at firms including Bank of America and Wachovia to supply social security numbers and other personal information, which he sold at a profit to debt collection agencies and law firms. Jailed for five years, he admitted: &quot;I made a bad judgment.&quot; \u2022 The Financial Services Authority imposed a \u00a3350,000 fine on BNP Paribas in 2007 for weak anti-fraud controls that were blamed for allowing an employee to defraud it of \u00a31.4m over four years. A senior employee in the French bank&apos;s London office targeted clients who spent much of their time overseas and had opted not to receive statements. \u2022 A computer programmer at Alabama-based Compass Bank was jailed last year for stealing a hard drive containing the names, account numbers and passwords of a million customers. James Real was convicted of using the data to encode counterfeit credit cards, used to withdraw $33,000. He was arrested walking away from a cash machine wearing a fake beard, a wig and sunglasses. \u2022 Britain&apos;s Halifax bank suffered an internal breach when a customer services adviser, Shana Campbell, leaked confidential information to a gang of fraudsters who siphoned \u00a32.3m from customer accounts in 2004 and 2005. Campbell was accused in court of a &quot;gross breach of trust&quot;. Among the customers whose accounts were compromised were a vicar, a Nigerian prince, several pensioners and African politicians."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/kathryn-flett-upfront", "sentences": ["And so I collected Jackson from school on 23 June and headed for Heathrow and an evening flight to Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Brisbane, and on to Surfers Paradise...

Thus it follows that the getting of what wisdom I have belatedly acquired has taken 45 years and a journey of 20,750ish miles, as a result of which I think I can honestly say I have finally grown up and put away childish things - or if not childish things, exactly (iPhone 3GS? Oh yes), then certainly childish emotions entirely unbecoming in a woman of middle years - ones which have cluttered my interior world for a lifetime but which are now bubble-wrapped, boxed up and stashed away in a metaphorical warehouse, never to be inspected again. Serious stuff, but of course I hadn&apos;t expected any of this to happen when I set off with my eldest son, Jackson, to Australia nearly three weeks ago, ostensibly for my brother&apos;s wedding, having been inspired to do so in part by Observer readers&apos; responses to a column I wrote a couple of months ago.  &quot;If you don&apos;t go you&apos;ll regret it for the rest of your life, you know you will...&quot; wrote one reader. But by then I had already made up my mind, so after a brief conversation with my brother Jonny (he sounded pleased, but with a certain sort of Aussie bloke one is necessarily forced to read between very few lines), I asked whether, with his fianc\u00e9e Felicity&apos;s blessing, we might keep my attendance (plus one) a secret from Mum, who is known to my son only as Faraway Grandma. Jonny agreed this &quot;surprise-surprise!&quot; element was an excellent idea.  In the hectic countdown to departure I&apos;d barely given much thought to the ramifications of my decision, but when I did, I reasoned that this trip was important for the following, entirely straightforward, reasons: a) I&apos;d been invited by my brother and soon-to-be sister-in-law, whom I&apos;d last seen eight years ago. This alone made it a no-brainer. b) It would be an opportunity for my eldest son to meet the other side of his family (I would have loved to have taken my youngest son, too, but logistically this wasn&apos;t an option).  c) It would be lovely for Ma to reacquaint herself with a grandson she&apos;d last seen when he was three months old.  d) It would be wonderful for me to share a glimpse of Australia with Jackson.  And more than that I didn&apos;t yet know, but I knew I&apos;d find out. So I persuaded my son&apos;s head teacher that a fortnight off school to see koalas in the fur-and-flesh was infinitely more educational than Key Stage Whatever.  Never knowingly light on baggage, I packed enough clothing solutions (aka clothes) to cover all potential spilling-related eventualities on both our parts, plus the possibility of encountering several seasons/emotions in one day - we&apos;d be flying into a Queensland winter, which meant hot days and cool evenings, and what with the jet lag and the wedding and blah blah, there would almost certainly be some tears before bedtime from both of us. And so I collected Jackson from school on 23 June and headed for Heathrow and an evening flight to Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Brisbane, and on to Surfers Paradise... After check-in, passport control and (thanks to a last-minute baggage reshuffle) narrowly avoiding having a pair of Tweezerman tweezers confiscated from my hand luggage for the fourth consecutive time - which, given that Tweezermen are not so much the Rolls-Royce as the Bugatti Veyron of tweezers, was a stepping stone on my journey to Wisdom Central - Jackson and I indulged in a bit of retail therapy in a seething Terminal 3 before boarding the flight, where I attempted to impress upon my excited and already exhausted son the quite extraordinary tediousness of the journey ahead, one in which the traditional &quot;Are we nearly there yet?&quot; would be met with a firm negative for an entire day, which would in turn, confusingly, be mostly night.  &quot;But it will be worth it, won&apos;t it, Mummy?&quot; said Jackson more as a statement than a question as he put on headphones and started surfing the movie channels. &quot;Yes, darling,&quot; I assured him, even though he couldn&apos;t hear. &quot;It&apos;ll definitely be worth it.&quot; To be continued ... \u2022 kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/13/obituary-johnny-collins-sea-songs", "sentences": ["By the time Johnny was posted to Singapore in 1959, he was listening to the American folk songs of the Weavers, Burl Ives and Woody Guthrie, but back in Catterick, Yorkshire, he met Tony Foxworthy, a staff member of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, who introduced him to English folk song."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-12T23:01:00Z", "title": "Johnny Collins | Obituary", "tags": ["Folk music", "Music", "Culture"], "article": "Best known as a singer of maritime songs and sea shanties, Johnny Collins, who has died aged 71 of a heart attack, had a full repertoire of folk songs, with a particular emphasis on songs with a chorus. In the style of the great American folk singer Pete Seeger, Johnny loved to have the audience sing the choruses with him. But they had to sing loudly to be heard above Johnny&apos;s strong, booming, bass voice. A frequent performer on mainland Europe, where sea songs and shanties in a variety of languages are very popular, Johnny achieved his greatest triumph in 1983 when he and his frequent singing partner Jim Mageean won an eastern European version of the Eurovision song contest - the Intervision song contest - staged in Rostock, East Germany. Other competitors made full use of the 96-piece orchestra, but Jim and Johnny won the hearts of the voting audience with a medley of unaccompanied sea shanties. Born in Norfolk, Johnny was adopted by a Belfast-born railwayman and his wife, a music teacher from Norwich. He left school at 16 and two years later joined the army - at first the Royal Engineers, but then transferring to the Royal Army Medical Corps. Stationed in London in 1958, he came across the jazz and folk clubs of the West End, learned to play the guitar, and sang alongside the jazz guitarist Diz Disley, folk singers Martin Winsor, Redd Sullivan and Alex Campbell, and the blues singer Long John Baldry. By the time Johnny was posted to Singapore in 1959, he was listening to the American folk songs of the Weavers, Burl Ives and Woody Guthrie, but back in Catterick, Yorkshire, he met Tony Foxworthy, a staff member of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, who introduced him to English folk song. At his next posting in Hong Kong, Johnny ran a folk club and sold out the City Hall with his new folk group. Leaving the army in 1968, Johnny was encouraged in his singing career by the folk singers Dave Burland, Roy Harris and Derek Elliott. Folk club fees did not allow Johnny to become fully professional, and he became chief laboratory technician at Watford hospital. By the mid-seventies, he had built an enviable reputation and released two albums, Traveller&apos;s Rest (1973) and Johnny&apos;s Private Army (1975). In Watford he was soon singing with Mageean. Concentrating on sea songs, they appeared at most British folk festivals, and together released albums, including Coming of Age (1996) and, with Graeme Knights, Good Times (2008). There were also solo recordings - Pedlar of Songs (1993) and Now and Then (2000). Through the 1980s and into the 90s, Johnny performed at many of the world&apos;s maritime festivals. In the US, he sang at the Maine and Newport maritime museums, as well as the Kendall Whaling Museum in Massachusetts, and the prestigious Mystic Seaport festival in Connecticut. He was the resident shantyman at Expo 88 in Brisbane, Australia, and for more than 20 years, was the main guest at the maritime festival in Workum, the Netherlands. In 1987, Johnny was invited by the East German government to the Berlin Shanty Festival (an unlikely event for a land-locked city) to celebrate Berlin&apos;s 750th anniversary. Other festival appearances were in Belgium, Poland and France. Johnny sang at the music events that accompanied the Cutty Sark Tall Ships races in Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Southampton, and he was a regular at maritime festivals in Hull, Lancaster, Portsmouth and Greenwich. A core of British folk festivals continued to welcome Johnny&apos;s brand of chorus singing, and he was a frequent guest at festivals in Bromyard and Chippenham, where his enthusiasm for folk song was widely appreciated. He is survived by his partner, Joyce Squires, and two children, Carol and Michael from an earlier marriage. \u2022 John Robert Collins, folk singer, born 10 May 1938, died 6 July 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jul/15/recession-public-service-delivery", "sentences": ["The huge gap between the UK&apos;s target of 2Mbps speed and Singapore&apos;s 1Gbps was cited as an example of a lack of central government ambition."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-14T23:01:00Z", "title": "Is the recession a chance to simplify and improve public service delivery?", "tags": ["Public services policy", "Public finance", "Society", "Recession", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "A row over impending public spending cuts has raised hackles in Westminster, with both major parties&apos; plans for tightening the public purse shrouded in a fog of claim and counter-claim. Government debt has spiralled above \u00a340bn to firefight the effects of the recession, but swingeing cuts are imminent. Last week, the chief executive of the Audit Commission, Steve Bundred, kick-started the debate by claiming that a \u00a350bn package of spending cuts and tax rises was necessary to keep UK plc afloat. Local authorities were already gearing up to swallow the bitter pill of a significant funding shortfall, but the debate for them has moved on to how public services can be maintained - and even improved - under such straitened conditions. A recent roundtable discussion convened by the Guardian, in partnership with Kent county council, picked through the thorny issue of public service reform. It was held at Tunbridge Wells Gateway, the latest in a series of centres across the county that bring together a wide variety of county council, district council, central government, health and voluntary sector services under one roof. The Gateway approach, which began in 2005, was held up as an example of how savings can be made by rationalising public sector services at the point of delivery, while simultaneously improving the client experience. The main theme of the discussion was how government can reconnect with people at a local level and make use of technological innovations to make service delivery more effective and, ultimately, cheaper. It was agreed that to achieve this there needed to be a &quot;revolution&quot; in thinking: a &quot;journey to modernisation&quot; that would see customers as citizens designing their future experience. Some participants felt that people don&apos;t always know what services they need, which means that traditional ways of delivering local government services are becoming obsolete; they should be issue-based &quot;life event centres&quot;, and not fixed to one agency offering one specific service. A participant said one result of the recession was that people weren&apos;t asking for housing or council tax benefits, but instead were saying: &quot;I&apos;ve lost my job.&quot; &quot;All sorts of things will flow from that. They may need debt counselling, employment and benefits advice, training, volunteering. Gateway puts all that under one roof.&quot; &apos;Inventing tomorrow&apos; The discussion was likened to &quot;inventing tomorrow&quot;, with a bare structure in which to work. One participant said: &quot;Young people are using the web, they&apos;re still using the phone, and they still want face-to-face interaction. The balance is going to change. We don&apos;t know how much, but it will be dramatic.&quot; Short-term thinking was considered one of the main barriers to successful reform. Decision makers needed to face up to the fact that services should be transactional, and be largely available online.  It was widely agreed that more resources did not equate to better quality public services, and vice versa. A participant pointed out on a wall map the hundreds of public sector buildings, saying: &quot;It&apos;s a disgrace how many there are. We don&apos;t need that many.&quot; Niche specialist providers were accused of wanting to build their own brand, to the detriment of service to the customer. &quot;We need to change our attitude to public space,&quot; said one participant, &quot;because there are billions of pounds worth of savings to be made.&quot; There was widespread frustration with the tribalism involved in administering public services. Agencies jealously guarding their branding was raised as a key barrier to the smooth integration of working practices. One person suggested an &quot;umbrella&quot; brand such as Gateway might make it harder for people to understand what services are available there. However, another participant said the Gateway project really had to be fought for, and people had to be won over and persuaded &quot;that the benefits were bigger than their brand&quot;. On the other hand, it was felt that brands such as Jobcentre Plus can be useful, as people know exactly what is on offer. Participants agreed that there was massive inertia to overcome. Legislation after regulation passed by the government has solidified a culture of conservatism within public sector professions, resulting in &quot;silo mentalities&quot; resistant to being customer-focused. &quot;Our job is to make a complex system simple for the general public,&quot; said one participant. &quot;That&apos;s the challenge for me - for all of us.&quot; The Department for Work and Pensions came under heavy fire for its perceived tribalism and inertia - which exacerbates its already heavy workload due to the recession - and for lacking a clear strategy to integrate with other agencies. There was further frustration with central government. People feel they have been &quot;defeated by bureaucracy&quot;, it was claimed. Some participants considered that the common denominator required was someone with a name, with a face, to explain things and help break the &quot;bureaucratic edifice&quot;. This apparent dichotomy with earlier assertions of a web-oriented service future was echoed by another participant, who said: &quot;Success is measured in terms of fewer people coming through the door, but customer satisfaction levels are lower online. It&apos;s no good driving everything online until we&apos;ve cracked multi-channel access.&quot; Pace of modernisation Developing this theme, it was claimed that public service modernisation hinged on Digital Britain - the plan of action for the UK&apos;s future in the digital and communications industry, developed by the minister for communications, technology and broadcasting, Stephen Carter - and the bandwidth of the UK&apos;s proposed broadband standard. The huge gap between the UK&apos;s target of 2Mbps speed and Singapore&apos;s 1Gbps was cited as an example of a lack of central government ambition. This would severely limit the pace of modernisation, one participant said. Kent was highlighted as an example of an authority seeking to harness technology, such as the single phone number used to access all public services, including health services.  Efficiency of public buildings was raised, particularly using school buildings and facilities as a wider community resource: &quot;It would be politically great to say Kent&apos;s 600 schools never closed, and were open to communities, social and voluntary groups, but it just wouldn&apos;t be true,&quot; said a participant. The situation has got even worse with the county&apos;s flagship academies, apparently, with requests for shared services flatly turned down by governors and other vested private finance initiative (PFI) bodies. The PFI is a government initiative that provides a way to fund major capital investments without recourse to public funds. &quot;Spending departments are staggeringly unconnected, and it&apos;s a hard job to get them together and get them thinking creatively,&quot; said a participant. &quot;And it would save them money if they did.&quot; A shakeup of local and central government publications was proposed by another participant as an example of a short-term money saver. &quot;Numerous publications through the door, each listing 52 websites, 35 phone numbers - and we think that&apos;s effective? It isn&apos;t.&quot; Local and central government working with other local agencies could save \u00a32m a year in Kent alone by combining publications and allowing advertising - with a long-term goal of publishing on the web only. The transformation of services leading to the closure of some public buildings provoked a passionate discussion. For instance, a postal-based system similar to a DVD rental club was proposed as a potential alternative to a community library. Just because a service is &quot;politically sensitive&quot; is no reason for it to get special treatment in these straitened times, it was argued. The response, particularly from the elected politicians present, suggested otherwise.  While local authorities were urged to &quot;use their elbows&quot; to effect change from the bottom up, the significance of political will from the top was not lost. A description of the stages of government as being a morphosis from corporate cabinet to robber barons was used to illustrate the traditional inertia of governing politicians. Would a Tory government have the will to transform public services, or would civil servants and the professions continue to spout empty rhetoric and act accordingly? &quot;Some people who have wanted to reform the way public services work for several decades see the recession as quite an opportunity,&quot; said one speaker. &quot;The future is going to have to be about better services for less cost.&quot; \u2022 Gateway: 08458 247 247 \u2022 Roundtable report commissioned and controlled by the Guardian.

Annual gross domestic product growth in the world&apos;s third largest economy rose from 6.1% in the first quarter of the year to 7.9% \u2013 well above predictions \u2013 the National Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday. The latest rise indicated that the country was on course to achieve its growth target of 8% for the year, said Jing Ulrich, JP Morgan&apos;s chairwoman for China equities. &quot;The recovery is confirmed. The bottom was the fourth quarter last year,&quot; Hao Daming, a senior economist at Galaxy Securities in Beijing, said. Many have hoped that China&apos;s huge industrial expansion and growing middle class hungry for consumer goods and previously unattainable luxuries such as cars could help to lead the world into recovery. But while officials heralded the good news, they cautioned that the basis of the rebound was not stable. Predictions of China&apos;s 2009 growth have wavered, but the International Monetary Fund recently raised its forecast by one percentage point to 7.5% and the World Bank boosted its forecast to 7.2%. Li Xiaochao, a spokesman for the statistics office, said the data had laid a foundation for hitting the 8% growth target, believed by many to be the level needed to hold down unemployment. &quot;Our economy is continuing to turn for the better and there are more and more positive factors,&quot; Li told a news conference. &quot;We see more people shopping and prices beginning to rise. The economy is recovering and the recovery is intensifying. All the government&apos;s policies have worked together to help us overcome the financial crisis.&quot; But he warned: &quot;The basis of the rebound of the people&apos;s economy is not stable. The recovery is not fully balanced, so there are some regions that have not done as well as others.&quot; A breakdown of the 7.1% GDP growth rate for the first half of 2009 showed that investment accounted for 6.2 percentage points \u2013 reflecting the government&apos;s infrastructure-driven 4 trillion yuan (\u00a3356bn) stimulus package. An increase in bank lending also helped the economy to pick up. Consumption added 3.8 percentage points to GDP but net exports, which have slumped this year, subtracted 2.9 points. Factory output growth rose 10.7% in June, faster than May&apos;s 8.9% growth, the bureau said. &quot;It&apos;s clear that China is successfully shifting from export-driven growth to domestic-driven growth. It&apos;s very encouraging,&quot; Tim Condon, head of Asia Research at ING in Singapore, said. In a research note, Standard Chartered analysts said China had seen a remarkable industrial output recovery. But it warned: &quot;What the headline number does not tell is the source of the output recovery... This revival in production is, in part, likely due to restocking. Also, as much of the demand comes from stimulus-related infrastructure projects or stimulus-backed subsidy programmes, this raises the issue of sustainability. Turn off the tap of infrastructure projects and you risk undermining growth \u2013 a key reason why we think bank loans will continue to flow.&quot; Electricity production rose for the first time in nine months, up around 3 per cent, compared with May&apos;s 3.2 per cent. Standard Chartered added that while retail sales rose by 15 per cent year-on-year in June, the data was probably painting too rosy a picture, noting that it included government and corporate purchases while excluding services. Despite yet another month of plummeting exports, Standard Chartered judged the worst was over for trade. Exports fell by 21.4 per cent year-on-year last month, compared with 26.4 per cent in May, while imports were down 13.2 per cent, compared with a fall of 25.2 per cent.

Rather it has advised people to &quot;stay away from the Mega Kuningan district and to avoid unnecessary journeys within central Jakarta for the time being&quot;   The menace of international terrorism returned to Indonesia when explosions ripped through two luxury hotels in Jakarta, killing eight guests and injuring at least 50 others. Two suicide bombers who had checked in as hotel guests triggered the blasts, which occurred within minutes of each other at the neighbouring JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in the Indonesian capital&apos;s business district. Two Australians and a New Zealander were reportedly among the dead, and the wounded included 18 other foreign nationals from the US, Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, Norway and South Korea. The Foreign Office said it had no indication of any British casualties. The attack forced Manchester United, who are on a pre-season tour of south-east Asia, to cancel a friendly fixture against an Indonesian XI in Jakarta on Monday. The team, currently in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, had planned to stay at the Ritz-Carlton this weekend. Investigators say the bombers had checked in to the Marriott on Wednesday and assembled the bombs in a room on the 18th floor, where an unexploded device was found after the blasts. CCTV cameras recorded the moment of the Marriott blast; grainy images show a man pulling a bag on wheels across the lobby before the flash of the explosion. The bombs went off in the hotels&apos; restaurants during breakfast. Witnesses reported seeing bloodied bodies being carried away moments after the explosions, which turned the facades of both hotels into masses of twisted metal. Others said they had seen hundreds of guests, most of whom appeared to be westerners, emerge dazed from the Ritz-Carlton as plumes of thick smoke engulfed nearby buildings and restaurants. &quot;There were bodies on the ground, one of them had no stomach,&quot; said a local man.&quot; The attacks came as Indonesia, the world&apos;s most populous Muslim country, appeared to be re-establishing itself as a tourist destination. They were the first in the country since 2005, when 20 people died in blasts on the resort island of Bali. No group has claimed responsibility, but analysts believe they were the work of Jemaah Islamiyah, an Islamist militant group that advocates an Islamist super-state spanning Indonesia, Malaysia, the southern Philippines, southern Thailand, Singapore and Brunei. The group carried out a bombing at the Marriott in 2003 in which 13 people died, and is blamed for over 50 other attacks in Indonesia in the last decade. They include the October 2002 bombings of two nightclubs in Bali in which 202 died, mainly westerners. Indonesia&apos;s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, condemned the attack as &quot;cruel and inhuman&quot; and vowed to hunt down the perpetrators. Yudhoyono, who was reelected last week, has been credited with bringing peace and stability to a country that had become a target for Islamist militants.&quot;[The bombers] do not have a sense of humanity and do not care about the destruction of our country, because this terror act will have a wide impact on our economy, our business climate, our tourism, our image in the world and many others,&quot; he said. Australia warned its citizens to reconsider plans to travel to Indonesia, and urged those already there to exercise &quot;extreme caution.&quot; Britons have been advised not to go there unless absolutely necessary. The Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, said he was &quot;sick in the stomach as I think all Australians would feel sick in the stomach. Australians accounted for 88 of the victims in the 2002 attacks on Bali. &quot;This is an assault on all of us and we are dealing with some very ugly people here,&quot; Rudd said. &quot;Very, very ugly people ... and dangerous.&quot; President Barack Obama said: &quot;These attacks make it clear that extremists remain committed to murdering innocent men, women and children of any faith in all countries.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/19/nazarbayev-kazakhstan-jonathen-aitken", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, Nazarbayev, who railed as a young man against Moscow&apos;s centralist idiocy in building vast steel plants in the middle of nowhere, decides to move Kazakhstan&apos;s capital to the middle of nowhere and creates wind-blown, freezing or sweltering Astana as the Singapore of the Steppes on the grounds that Almaty, with its 28 nightclubs, hasn&apos;t got enough building land free."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-18T23:01:00Z", "title": "Review: Nazarbayev and the Making of Kazakhstan by Jonathen Aitken", "tags": ["History", "Biography", "Politics", "Jonathan Aitken", "Books", "Culture", "Politics", "Kazakhstan", "South and Central Asia", "Nursultan Nazarbayev"], "article": "Here, make no mistake, is wondrous hagiography. It depends on 23 hours of personal interviews graciously donated by its subject. It relies, for supporting evidence, on the good opinions of his friends (or of those too cowed to utter a word out of place). It becomes curiously tolerant when oppression, corruption and galloping megalomania are on the menu. But, mush and slush notwithstanding, it is also a fascinating, cleverly orchestrated snow job: quite probably the hagiography of the year.  And the puzzle - indeed, the great puzzle about Nursultan Nazarbayev, supreme leader of the ninth-largest country in the world and its burgeoning oil reserves - is why he should be remotely concerned about burnishing his image thus, because relentless PR offensives actually sell him short.  A few years ago, I went to one such PR event in Almaty, a conference on the big issues of journalism, blandly fronted by old CNN hands. My session was all about press freedom - and freedom campaigners from the surrounding -stans had their uncowed morning in the spotlight. They didn&apos;t shut up. They attacked, as the president&apos;s men sat glowering. But why, you wondered, get into this fine, embarrassing mess in the first place? The answer, which Jonathan Aitken can&apos;t really get round to supplying, is that Nursultan Nazarbayev is an amazing and amazingly conflicted man: the son of a shepherd who couldn&apos;t read, the brightest boy in his school, a sheet-metal worker turned metallurgist, a rising communist star as the Soviet empire withered and died. Talent saw him rise through the ranks of stultified bureaucracy and made him president of Kazakhstan. Sheer talent helped him negotiate his way out of the union and overcome an endless series of crises that threatened his fledgling state. Natural talent underpinned his Caspian deals with Chevron, Mobil and the rest, helped him build pipelines to the west and enabled him to set out his stall as one of the world&apos;s great energy suppliers. He succeeded because, in the midst of stumbling gerontocracy, he was the brightest and the best. He&apos;s a brilliant wheeler-dealer, formidable orator, tireless toiler - and consumer of local vodka - and a politician Gorbachev describes here as &quot;consistently right on the big issues ... a leader who handled the disaster [of Soviet disintegration] better than any of the other newly independent countries&quot;.  He masterminded the end of Kazakhstan&apos;s nuclear arsenal with passionate conviction. He reached out to Beijing and Moscow with the shrewdness of a natural statesman. Nazarbayev doesn&apos;t need building up or sanitising; his record speaks for itself.  But this book, by its very existence, somehow says that this isn&apos;t enough. He wants to be seen as an embryo democrat, a paternalist bringer of education and harmony to a bewilderingly multi-ethnic land. He cherishes his meetings with Thatcher just as much as those with Yeltsin. He welcomes Aitken just as enthusiastically as Jonathan&apos;s old chum from BAe and al-Yamamah contract days, Sir Dick Evans, now chairman of Samruk, &quot;the state holding company named after the mythical Kazakh bird that lays golden eggs&quot;. So, suddenly, nothing quite fits. His senior son-in-law, head of the tax police, counter-terrorism policy and Kazakhstan&apos;s main TV station, falls out with Nazarbayev in spectacular fashion - and keeps turning up as ambassador to Austria amid melodramatic tales of coups, murders and rampant corruption only the de Medicis would understand. Meanwhile, Nazarbayev, who railed as a young man against Moscow&apos;s centralist idiocy in building vast steel plants in the middle of nowhere, decides to move Kazakhstan&apos;s capital to the middle of nowhere and creates wind-blown, freezing or sweltering Astana as the Singapore of the Steppes on the grounds that Almaty, with its 28 nightclubs, hasn&apos;t got enough building land free.  Aitken, foot on the softest pedals going, can&apos;t make much sense of any of this. He is stuck with either praising or pursing his lips. He cannot paint Nazarbayev&apos;s full, florid, fantastic mix of contradictions. But he tells an essentially simplified story with practised skill: at least he puts Kazakhstan where it firmly belongs - near the top of any intensive diplomatic reading list for the 21st century."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jul/19/expat-finance", "sentences": ["Oranges are expensive in Singapore; computer equipment, furniture and white goods all cost more in southern Europe than in the UK; but in Cyprus, you can buy a large bunch of rocket for \u20ac0.30, which would set you back \u00a32 in Sainsbury&apos;s.  Used cars You can always pick up a used car for a few hundred quid, right?"], "publicationDate": "2009-07-18T23:01:00Z", "title": "Don't let your expat dream be a financial nightmare", "tags": ["Expat finance", "Money"], "article": "Can&apos;t decide whether to move abroad? No wonder. The papers are full of stories of expats caught by currency swings and falling property prices - yet a recent NatWest survey reported that 87% of Brits abroad think they&apos;re in a better position to survive the downturn than they would be at home. So who&apos;s right? The answer, says Mike Hardaker, co-founder of expat website AngloInfo, is that moving abroad can be rewarding - if you keep your eyes open and have the &quot;cultural humility&quot; to ask stupid questions. With that in mind, here are 10 pitfalls to avoid. Currency swings Of all the problems to hit expats, the weak pound has been the biggest. But currency swings aren&apos;t new. &quot;I lived for six years in South Africa, and the exchange rate fluctuated by about 40% over that period,&quot; Hardaker warns. To protect against surprises, try to arrange affairs as a local would do, says Rupert Holderness, managing director of Siddalls France, an independent financial adviser for emigrating Brits. He has been advising clients to hold euro-dominated investments for that reason. Check out past rates at oanda.com/convert/fxhistory and seek the best rate by contacting specialist currency brokers; don&apos;t assume your bank will offer the best deal. Unexpected taxes If you become a tax-resident abroad and expect the system to work just like in the UK, you&apos;re in for a shock. Other countries, for example, tax you not just on income, but on assets. This includes &quot;wealth tax&quot; in France, now effective after five years&apos; tax-residence; and the &quot;foreign investment fund tax&quot; in Australia - which, Siddalls consultant Robert Brealey warns, is levied on non-Australian investment growth, including Isas and personal pensions, if those assets total more than A$50,000 (\u00a324,400). And in France and Hong Kong, there&apos;s no PAYE - so put money aside for tax. Lost UK perks As well as finding out about taxes abroad, budget for lost UK perks. For example, you can&apos;t add to an Isa if you&apos;re not a UK tax resident, unless you&apos;re a Crown servant or married to one - although you can keep it, and add to it if you return.  Homebuying costs Buying a British house is complicated enough. Abroad, transaction costs can top 10% of the purchase price: in Germany, costs include the notary (up to 1.5%), property tax (3.5%), agents&apos; fees and registration. In many countries, says Hardaker, you might have to put up a bigger deposit than you do here. Check local media for problems: there have been pages of coverage in Spain, where Brits have bought into illegal developments, while in Cyprus, others have bought homes and then discovered they can&apos;t get title deeds released. Health cover We whinge about the NHS, but it&apos;s free at point of use, unlike many countries. In France, suggests Holderness, budget for top-up health insurance, because the state doesn&apos;t pay the full cost of care. And if you&apos;re not paying social insurance in France and aren&apos;t receiving an EU state pension, you&apos;ll need evidence of private health cover, he adds.  Inheritance planning If you move abroad, take some advice on inheritance to avoid problems. Generally, if you&apos;re domiciled in the UK but resident abroad, UK inheritance tax will be chargeable on your worldwide assets - unless there&apos;s a double taxation agreement that says otherwise. That&apos;s the case in France, says Holderness, where succession rules can be a &quot;shock to the system&quot; - if you die, they provide for children to inherit part of the estate before the death of your spouse. Internet - or lack of it If you rely on comparison websites to find deals on everything from consumables to utilities, then going to a country where internet shopping is an immature market can feel like stepping back in time. And access might cost more too - in Cyprus, for example, budget more than \u20ac40 a month for 2MB broadband. Changing luxuries Depending on where you are in the world, the perception of &quot;luxury&quot; can differ. Oranges are expensive in Singapore; computer equipment, furniture and white goods all cost more in southern Europe than in the UK; but in Cyprus, you can buy a large bunch of rocket for \u20ac0.30, which would set you back \u00a32 in Sainsbury&apos;s.  Used cars You can always pick up a used car for a few hundred quid, right? Not outside the UK you can&apos;t. &quot;The UK has very inexpensive second-hand cars,&quot; says Hardaker, &quot;partly because the market is flooded by fleet sales.&quot;  Remember relatives You should budget for flights to see friends and relatives back in Britain. &quot;If I want to take the kids, there&apos;s even more cost involved,&quot; cautions Matt Shaw, Netherlands-based community relations manager at the expat advice website Expatica."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/20/census-population-ageing-global", "sentences": ["Its life expectancy at birth \u2013 82 years \u2013 is matched only by Singapore, though in western Europe, France, Sweden and Italy all have life expectancies of more than 80 years (in the UK it is 78.8)."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-20T18:13:52Z", "title": "Population of older people set to surpass number of children, report finds", "tags": ["Population", "Older people", "Health", "Science", "US news", "UK news", "Japan", "World news", "Pensions", "Family finances", "Money", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The world is about to cross a demographic landmark of huge social and economic importance, with the proportion of the global population 65 and over set to outnumber children under five for the first time. A new report by the US census bureau highlights a huge shift towards not just an ageing but an old population, with formidable consequences for rich and poor nations alike. The transformation carries with it challenges for families and policymakers, ranging from how to care for older people living alone to how to pay for unprecedented numbers of pensioners \u2013 more than 1 billion of them by 2040. The report, An Ageing World: 2008, shows that within 10 years older people will outnumber children for the first time. It forecasts that over the next 30 years the number of over-65s is expected to almost double, from 506 million in 2008 to 1.3 billion \u2013 a leap from 7% of the world&apos;s population to 14%. Already, the number of people in the world 65 and over is increasing at an average of 870,000 each month. The rate of growth will shoot up in the next couple of years, with both overall numbers and proportions of older people rising rapidly.  The shift is due to a combination of the time-delayed impact of high fertility levels after the second world war and more recent improvements in health that are bringing down death rates at older ages. Separate UN forecasts predict that the global population will top 9 billion by 2050. The US census bureau has led the way in sounding the alarm over the changes. This is its ninth report drawing together data from around the globe since it first focused on the trend in 1987. Its latest projections warn governments and international bodies the tipping point will present widespread challenges at every level of human organisation, starting with the structure of the family, which will be transformed as people live longer.  That will in turn bring new burdens on carers and social services providers, while patterns of work and retirement will similarly have huge implications for health services and pensions systems.  &quot;People are living longer, and in some parts of the world, healthier lives,&quot; the authors conclude. &quot;This represents one of the crowning achievements of the last century but also a significant challenge as proportions of older people increase in most countries.&quot; Europe is the greyest continent, with 23 of the world&apos;s 25 oldest countries. Such dominance of the regional league table will continue. By 2040, more than one in four Europeans are expected to be at least 65, and one in seven at least 75.  The UK comes in at number 19 in the list of the world&apos;s oldest countries. Top of the pile is Japan, which recently supplanted Italy as the world&apos;s oldest big country. Its life expectancy at birth \u2013 82 years \u2013 is matched only by Singapore, though in western Europe, France, Sweden and Italy all have life expectancies of more than 80 years (in the UK it is 78.8). The contrast in life expectancy between rich and poor nations remains glaring. The report shows that a person born in a developed country can expect to outlive his or her counterpart in the developing world by 14 years. Zimbabwe holds the unfortunate record for the lowest life expectancy, which has been cut to 40 through a combination of Aids, famine and dictatorship. But an important finding of the report is that the wave of ageing that has until recently been considered a phenomenon of the developed world is fast encroaching on poorer countries too. More than 80% of the increase in older people in the year up to July 2008 was seen in developing countries. By 2040, the poor world is projected to be home to more than 1 billion people aged 65 and over \u2013 fully 76% of the world total. Ageing will put pressure on societies at all levels. One way of measuring that is to look at the older dependency ratio, or ODR, which acts as an indicator of the balance between working-age people and the older population that must be supported by them. The ODR is the number of people aged 65 and over for every 100 people aged 20 to 64. It varies widely, from just six in Kenya and seven in Bangladesh, to 33 in Italy and also Japan. The UK has an ODR of 26, and the US has 21. From that ratio, a number of profound challenges flow. Countries with a high ODR are already creaking under the burden of funding prolonged retirement for their older population. Life expectancy after retirement has already reached 21 years for French men and 26 years for French women. Though retirement ages have begun to rise in developed countries, partly through inducements from governments to continue working, this still puts an extreme burden on public pensions funds. Socially, too, there are intense pressures on individuals and families. With women living on average seven years longer than men, more older women are living alone. Around half of all women 65 and over in Germany, Denmark and Slovakia are on their own, with all the consequent issues of loneliness and access to care that ensue."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/21/newcastle-alan-shearer-damien-duff", "sentences": ["We&apos;re sick of hearing it, to be honest.&quot; Steve McMahon, the commercial director of the Profitable Group, which has said it will appoint Shearer if its takeover bid is successful, regards this week as critical for the Singapore-based group&apos;s hopes of assuming control of Newcastle."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-20T23:10:02Z", "title": "Damien Duff calls for Alan Shearer to be named Newcastle manager", "tags": ["Newcastle United", "Alan Shearer", "Mike Ashley", "Championship", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Damien Duff, the Newcastle United winger, believes Alan Shearer is the only man capable of bringing an end to the misery at St James&apos; Park and has criticised the delay in appointing the former England striker as manager.

Goodyear has resigned after a boardroom bust-up, just three months before he was due to take over from Ho Ching, wife of the Singaporean prime minister. In a joint statement, Temasek and Goodyear said that they accepted that &quot;there are differences regarding certain strategic issues that could not be resolved. In light of the differences, both parties have decided that it is in their mutual interest to terminate the leadership transition process.&quot; Temasek, which controls assets worth $84bn, declined to elaborate, but sources close to the company said that Goodyear had resigned when it became clear that he would not be granted the freedom of action that he sought following his appointment in March. Goodyear has been on the board since March and was due to become CEO in October. Analysts in Singapore claimed that Goodyear had been squeezed out by Ho Ching, who was reluctant to leave, despite a Temasek statement five months ago saying that she was to be replaced by Goodyear. Goodyear has been working at Temasek&apos;s headquarters in Singapore, but is thought to have grown increasingly frustrated at the investment company&apos;s bureaucratic structure. Although it is nominally independent of government, Temasek has traditionally been viewed as an arm of the Singaporean state and symbol of the country&apos;s growing economic power. But that power has been capped by the financial crisis and Temasek earlier this year reported that the value of investments had fallen by over 30%, causing consternation and anger among local politicians. At that point, Temasek appeared to bow to public pressure by announcing that Ho Ching would step down this August and be replaced by Goodyear, who took over from Brian Gilbertson at BHP in 2003. He was born in the US and is a former investment banker. But with just a few months to go until Goodyear was due to take the helm, it had become increasingly clear that Ho Ching had no plans to leave her post, and that her stance was supported by government. The Singaporean establishment had never been happy that Temasek would be headed by an outsider, according to analysts. Temasek owns 19% of Standard Chartered bank, but recently booked losses on holdings in Barclays and Merrill Lynch, which was taken over by Bank of America at the height of the banking collapse. Another theory circulating about Goodyear&apos;s departure is that he was unable to persuade the board about the value of investing in mining and resources, his area of expertise. A move into mining might have jeopardised Singapore&apos;s growing relationship with China, which is looking to acquire mining assets to fuel its economic expansion. But sources close to the government of Singapore said that there had been &quot;a clash of cultures.&quot; Temasek&apos;s chairman, Suppiah\u00a0Dhanabalan, said: &quot;A future CEO has to be someone who understands and shares our values, and who is also a builder of people, institutions and opportunities. Unfortunately, at this halfway mark, both the board and Chip have come to the conclusion that it is in our mutual interest not to proceed with the planned leadership change.&quot; Goodyear said in a statement: &quot;I&apos;m really sorry that we are unable to continue with the leadership transition. Temasek has a fantastic platform and I wish Ho Ching and the board all the best.&quot; Once tipped as a future chairman of BP, Goodyear joined the Australian-based group BHP in 1999 as chief financial officer and spearheaded its merger with Billiton of South Africa in 2001."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/21/viewpoint-nils-pratley-shop-drop", "sentences": ["Chip chopSo Chip Goodyear, former boss of BHP Billiton, didn&apos;t see eye-to-eye with the powers behind Temasek, the Singapore investment fund."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-21T20:11:30Z", "title": "Britons back in the shops, but not till they drop", "tags": ["Morrisons", "Next", "Retail industry", "Recession", "Government borrowing", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Business"], "article": "Never underestimate the willingness of Britons to spend money in the shops. Next and Morrisons are saying that life really isn&apos;t so bad. Next, which in March had been warning that like-for-like sales would fall 6%-9% in the first half, said the actual fall was 1.9%. At Morrisons, sales were bound to rise, but the rate of increase in profits is about 10% above expectations. There are special factors at work. Next, like most clothing retailers, loves hot weather. Morrisons is still catching up on where it would have been years ago if it had not initially botched the integration of Safeway. Even so, these two snapshots suggest life on the high street is far rosier than it ought to be. What&apos;s going on? And can it last? Part of the answer to the first question is that Next chief executive Simon Wolfson was right. The &quot;retail Armageddon&quot;, as he called it, has not materialised because many people&apos;s disposable income has risen significantly. If you&apos;re in stable full-time employment with a mortgage, then a cocktail of lower interest rates, lower inflation and lower VAT tastes pleasant. Some of the extra cash is being diverted into savings, but a large chunk is being spent: consumers are consuming. That is why, in the face of rising unemployment, which would normally be a big deflationary force, clothing retailers can talk about pushing up prices by 3% or so. Better still (for them), the big squeeze on buying margins from a lower pound appears to be more of a gentle embrace: idle factories in China are made to share the currency pain. But retailers cannot defer the pain of recession indefinitely. Interest rates can&apos;t go any lower. When they start to rise again (some time in the next 12 months), householders may finally be persuaded of the need to save. The VAT cut is also due to be reversed at the end of this year. Next expects the consumer environment in the second half of the year to be similar to that of the first half. Yes, it probably can last that long. But retailers shouldn&apos;t expect 2010 to be any better. Borrowed time The good news was that public sector net borrowing in June was \u00a313bn, not the \u00a315bn-plus expected in the City. The chancellor has clearly got one thing right: his estimate of \u00a3175bn for the financial year appears to be realistic. There is even an outside chance of an undershoot. The bad news is that last month&apos;s figure still represented the highest figure ever seen for June. The sum of \u00a341.2bn for the second quarter, or about \u00a3700 for every UK citizen, was also a record. Regardless of the solidity of Alistair Darling&apos;s estimates, we are clearly in territory where financial markets and foreign investors will be nervous. At the moment, uneasy calm reigns. Gilt prices have not collapsed and sterling has recovered some of the ground lost in the past year. One euro costs 86p, which is quite a bounce from near-parity. There is an unspoken understanding that, less than a year before an election, it is not realistic to expect politicians of either main party to be frank about their policies on taxation and public spending. There is trust that, once the politics are out of the way, the next UK government will do what the IMF and OECD want: set out a faster plan to improve the public finances. That trust can&apos;t be described as deep, however. Foreigners have been selling gilts aggressively in recent months, leaving the domestic banks and the Bank of England to take the strain. Now that the gilt-buying spree called quantitative easing appears to be drawing to a close, we should get a clearer idea of the true level of demand for UK debt. Don&apos;t expect a rush. If Britain can escape with a gentle rise in gilt yields, as opposed to a steep and sudden correction, we&apos;ll be doing well. Chip chopSo Chip Goodyear, former boss of BHP Billiton, didn&apos;t see eye-to-eye with the powers behind Temasek, the Singapore investment fund. It&apos;s not a surprise. Sovereign wealth funds have never had a pure approach to investment and persist in introducing notions of national pride. That&apos;s why so many were suckered into refinancing supposedly prestigious American banks before the awful truth dawned. We don&apos;t know for certain whether something of this sort lay behind Goodyear&apos;s departure, but it&apos;s a logical guess. Temasek must speak for itself, but there are signs the penny is dropping elsewhere. China Investment Corporation has bought 1.1% of Diageo, the drinks group. Very sensible too: if you&apos;ve got squillions to spend, small slices of lots of solid multinationals is the way to go. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/23/xabi-alonso-liverpool-real-madrid-transfer", "sentences": ["But as Alonso trained with the squad in advance of their friendly against Singapore, a Liverpool spokesman insisted an ankle injury was the only reason for his absence.", "&quot;Xabi is with us in Singapore, and will train with the rest of the squad,&quot; said the spokesman."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-23T12:20:23Z", "title": "Liverpool deny Real Madrid deal for Xabi Alonso", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Transfer window", "Real Madrid", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Liverpool have dismissed claims that they have agreed a fee to sell Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid.

But I&apos;ve not lost hope that things can be resolved.&quot; Pardeza, who confirmed Madrid have been looking for an alternative to Alonso but with little success, admitted a lack of progress in their chase of defender Arbeloa. &quot;With Arbeloa there was an option which, at the moment, has come to nothing. Liverpool haven&apos;t had much intention of letting him go, even though he has one year left on his contract, and we are still in this situation,&quot; Pardeza told Spanish newspaper Publico. &quot;There is more than a month of the transfer market left and this could change. I&apos;m not going to deny that we&apos;d like to have Arbeloa.&quot; As the rest of the squad trained in Thailand, Martin Skrtel and Nabil El Zhar flew home to have potentially serious injuries assessed in the UK. Skrtel has a hamstring problem while El Zhar damaged a knee ligament, both in the friendly against Thailand. Skrtel&apos;s is potentially the most serious injury and there are fears that he will miss the start of the season. El Zhar will be out of action for at least a fortnight, and may not be available until the home friendly with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 8 August. Meanwhile, plans for a refinancing deal for the club&apos;s owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett are uncertain. The deadline for their loans to be refinanced with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia is tomorrow. In public, the Americans are confident of securing the refinancing for the original \u00a3350m loans, but negotiations appear likely to continue beyond the end of this week with rumours that Wachovia are reluctant to agree the deal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/23/hillary-clinton-asia-tour", "sentences": ["Others, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, are increasingly drawn towards Beijing&apos;s powerful economic orbit."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-23T17:00:00Z", "title": "Memo to Clinton: US ain't top dog | Simon Tisdall", "tags": ["Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "World news", "US news", "US politics"], "article": "Speaking in Washington before embarking on this week&apos;s Asian tour, Hillary Clinton set out the most definitive version yet of how the Obama administration intends to deal with the world. The US secretary of state spoke of &quot;a new era of engagement based on common interests, shared values, and mutual respect&quot; and of a foreign policy &quot;blending principle and pragmatism&quot;. Contrasting this collaborative approach with the &quot;for us or against us&quot; stance of the Bush administration, Clinton said the US would opt for diplomacy first when dealing with Iran, North Korea and other nations or adversaries. There were no guarantees of success; and dialogue did not imply acceptance of repressive regimes. But &quot;we cannot be afraid or unwilling to engage ... as long as engagement might advance our interests&quot;. Clinton&apos;s call for a &quot;multi-partner&quot; rather than a multi-polar world is the diplomatic equivalent of police brutality victim Rodney King&apos;s famous (and unsuccessful) plea for mutual tolerance at the height of the 1992 Los Angeles race riots. &quot;People, I just want to say, you know, can we all get along?&quot; asked King. Clinton&apos;s similar, less eloquent call for international amity and understanding may also have limited impact. Today North Korea&apos;s hothead leadership lambasted her, saying she resembled &quot;a pensioner going shopping&quot;. So no breakthrough just yet. More surprisingly perhaps, Clinton&apos;s visits this week to India and Thailand, where she met leaders of south-east Asian nations and her Chinese, Russian, South Korean and Japanese counterparts, suggested to some that the US may struggle to maintain constructive partnerships with its allies, let alone its enemies. These tensions are only partly attributable to George Bush&apos;s toxic legacy and resulting anti-Americanism. They have more to do with perceived changes in the global balance of power, principally a post-crash decline in US clout and a parallel expansion of Chinese and Indian influence. In Delhi, Clinton was publicly slapped down over pre-Copenhagen pressure from Washington and others for binding caps on carbon emissions, with environment minister Jairam Ramesh complaining about mooted carbon tariffs on Indian exports. At the same time, she acquiesced in Bush&apos;s nuclear technology deal with India, which drove a coach and horses through the international non-proliferation regime, and gave a green light to massive future US arms sales to India, hardly reassuring prospects for Pakistan. Clinton also appears to have tip-toed around the issue of divided Kashmir, mindful perhaps of British foreign secretary David Miliband&apos;s bruising experience in Delhi earlier this year. This is odd, given the high importance Washington attaches to its Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy and its wish that Pakistani troops, currently deployed along the Line of Control facing India, be redirected into the battle against the Taliban and Islamist militants. These and other strains are certain to resurface once the jolly bonhomie surrounding Clinton&apos;s visit, more resembling a campaign trail meet-and-greet than a diplomatic summit, dissipates. &quot;Obama is committed to ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty and strengthening the non-proliferation treaty [India is party to neither] ... He also intends for the US to be part of the international effort to replace the Kyoto protocol with a treaty-based climate control regime including India, China and other emerging powers,&quot; noted Strobe Talbott of the Brookings Institution thinktank in a recent article. Such fundamental differences do not bode well for the strengthened, strategic partnership with India that Clinton enthused about. Clinton&apos;s declaration in Thailand that the US was &quot;back&quot; in south-east Asia, and intended to give greater priority to its friends in the region, also elicited mixed responses. Her ever tougher line on North Korea, coupled with US pressure on Asean members to do more to confront the Burmese junta, makes many countries nervous. This cage-rattling could yet prove counter-productive. Old ally Japan, for example, may be about to elect a party pledged to re-examine the role of the US military in the Asia-Pacific region. Others, such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, are increasingly drawn towards Beijing&apos;s powerful economic orbit. For its part, China itself may no longer be a US enemy \u2013 but it remains unclear whether, on a range of international issues, it can really be classed as a friend. Mostly China suits itself. These days it can afford to. Yet possibly the biggest obstacle to the &quot;new mindset&quot; partnerships Clinton envisaged in her Washington speech is of her own creation \u2013 her very old-fashioned assumption that, in all such arrangements, the US will naturally be top dog and pack leader. This is what Iranian conservatives term the &quot;global arrogance&quot;.

Made a movie. Made some comic books - and now making the TV show again, not sure how that happened ... well, no, I am sure: I&apos;m looking at it right now. Never has the voice of the audience been so important.&quot; There&apos;s always a huge audience for Joss Whedon at Comic-Con; it&apos;s not only quality of work he produces, or the sheer quantity of TV shows, films, comic books of both the spin-off and original character flavours. His panels are also just funny. And informal, well-informed and carry a sense of the give and take of the creator/fan relationship. So people come to them. And so it was with his Friday appearance at this year&apos;s show. He came on, talked about upcoming projects for a while, including The Cabin in the Woods, new comics and, of course, the second season of Dollhouse. But first, let&apos;s take a stroll through the banterish, admiration-fuelled fun: What is Joss Whedon currently reading? &quot;Wired. That&apos;s pretty much what I read and what I have time for. I&apos;m also reading Julie and Julia - I&apos;m not taking much inspiration from that for the show.&quot; Some questions on casting resulted the announcement that &quot;I do believe we&apos;ll seeing a few episodes with a young ing\u00e9nue called be Alexis Dennisof&quot; (Wesley Wyndam-Pryce from Angel/Buffy, husband of Alyson Hannigan), which pleased everyone in the hall a great deal. When asked about his process, he was more vague - he doesn&apos;t really have a process, he says, he just absorbs things and then regurgitates them in an order that tell a good story, and tell it well. Oh, and also, when it comes to Dollhouse: &quot;We have a dartboard - with various phrases: &apos;Gets wiped&apos;, &apos;Has sex&apos;, &apos;Gets killed&apos; and we throw foam darts at it when we get stuck. I&apos;m actually serious. It really helps.&quot; Which, some would say, explains quite a lot.  Dollhouse is where the rest of the session went, and where I will concentrate my information from hereon. Usually, at around this point in the Dollhouse posts, I would say as we&apos;re working on the UK schedule, if you have seen the rest to the end of season one - please don&apos;t spoil it for anyone else. But, just this once: IF YOU HAVEN&apos;T SEEN AT LEAST UP TO SEASON ONE EP.12 OF DOLLHOUSE PLEASE STOP READING - not because we don&apos;t like you, or because anyone would judge you, just because THERE WILL BE SPOILERS. After the introduction - and the minutes of wooting and clapping and squeeeeing from the stuffed-to-capacity ballroom - there was the premiere of Episode 13 (called Epitaph One) which won&apos;t air otherwise in the US although Britain should see it as part of the normal run. Well it was meant to be a world premiere; it was actually screened on demand in Singapore, so many people at the screening probably would have already torrented it. The actual episode however? Well, that we&apos;ll review/discuss that as part of the usual run of Dollhouse episodes - but the important thing to know is that as an extra episode, it&apos;s completely derailing. It changed everything. And it&apos;s very different. It straightforwardly addresses the moral implications of the dolls and their imprints; the consequences on all the characters, the levels of power and control. It&apos;s got a dark, post-apocalyptic setting, 10 years in the future from episode 12; great new characters; a goodly number of twists; very little Eliza Dushku (who is now producer, and has some other kind of live action film version of a video game in the works, by the way). It was - in all, a whole different show. And one that made you realise that season one was all set up, and there&apos;s a lot more planned out. But it&apos;s hard to see how they&apos;re going to pull back from that into a season two. And I wish someone would have directly asked that in the Q&amp;A. It&apos;s not like I was expecting any bad questions - or any negative opinions about Dollhouse - but some at least touched the touchy issues, as well as saying many things that critics and fan communities would expect to hear. So: they were expecting cancellation - joking or not, when Whedon started a sentence with &quot;When we accidentally forgot to get cancelled,&quot; he sounded like he meant it. And episode 13 was going to be their answer to not being able to finish the story in fully, drawn out way. But now they have more time to build on what they&apos;ve made.  Whedon had some ideas. &quot;When we accidentally forgot to get cancelled, we talked about it a lot - but bear in mind a lot of what you saw in Epitaph One was flashbacks and memories, and you can&apos;t always count on those, especially with dolls.&quot; Which sounds like a worryingly complex plan. Basically, somehow, they have to create a season two that speaks both to the people that are watching purely on the basis of what happened in season one, and people who are intrigued to see how that will turn into the darker, more complex and dramatic events in episode 13. But finding a story and a line of continuity that will balance the two? That&apos;s going to be very, very tough. I look forward to it enormously. Perhaps Whedon should add a few more labels to his Dollhouse dartboard: &apos;False memory&apos;, &apos;Fake Imprint&apos; and &apos;Woke up and discovered it was all a dream&apos;.

The phrase became an embarrassment for its own progenitors and practitioners some time ago. Nevertheless, the Blairite &quot;ultras&quot; often want to make attack the best form of defence, arguing that the Third Way, while having its day, is not radical enough and that a &quot;fourth way&quot; is needed: that reform must be permanent or it dies ... a kind of merging of Maoism with the mumbo-jumbo end of management theory. They do not, of course, stop to ask whether this &quot;fourth way&quot; is even more &quot;neo-liberal&quot; than the Third Way, and is indeed a means of outflanking the Tories on the right. The late Milton Friedman, in a sneering essay on Marx, once said that, even if capital was formed from the sweat of dead workers, then so what \u2013 what did they expect? Elegant tombstones? It&apos;s time to give the Third Way a dignified burial, and recognise that the intellectual perspiration of its advocates was exploited to produce intellectual capital for neo-liberalism. The Third Way&apos;s most impressive political statement came in the final report of the Commission for Social Justice (1994), set up by John Smith, chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, overseen by Patricia Hewitt and written by David Miliband. It distinguished between &quot;egalitarians&quot; (Old Labour, you see), &quot;deregulators&quot; (the Tories) and &quot;investors&quot; (New Labour, conveniently launched in the same year when Tony Blair was elected to succeed Smith after his untimely death). It really did have some promising policies, it seemed, to add to the &quot;Third Way&quot; mission. But the devil was in the political economy. New Labour never had an alternative \u2013 or &quot;Third Way&quot; \u2013 political economy to underpin its ambitious social policies and fiscal ambitions. The latter grew by accident rather than by design and had to be financed by Brown&apos;s stealth taxes and, when these ran out, the permanent growth which would flow from ... ahem \u2026 an &quot;end to boom and bust&quot;. The attempts to find a new political economy died quickly. &quot;Post-neoclassical endogenous growth theory&quot; (laughed out of court by Michael Heseltine as &quot;Balls, not Brown&quot;) smacked of creative statism but soon became zero-sum competition between regions with a dose of trickle-down. And what happened to being the investors rather than the deregulators? Brown became the doyen of deregulation, and the further descent of the British economy along its twin tracks (financial services and arms) continued apace, with rules from Brussels quoted by hand-wringing ministers every time the chance to re-invest in manufacturing came along. What about the &quot;stakeholder economy&quot;, trailed in Blair&apos;s Singapore speech on his way to pay homage at Rupert Murdoch&apos;s court somewhere off Australia, in 1996? Ditched when Will Hutton was revealed as a dangerous leftie. This meant that old-fashioned tax-and-spend could only be avoided by permanent growth on the scale of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Yet this growth contained the seeds of its own demise: the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act by that self-proclaimed Third Wayer President Clinton stimulated the financial lending which was geared to &quot;buying in&quot; those in the sticks to housing-based prosperity, but which eventually triggered the sub-prime collapse and the wider financial and economic crisis. Not only was there a burst in the bubble, as the market &quot;self-corrected&quot;; there was a longer-term bust as the long boom ended. There was no Third Way in political economy to end the capitalist trade cycle; and therefore there was no economic basis for preserving the Third Way social programmes and the more traditional social expenditure (eg on the NHS) which New Labour had to its credit. As I write, the prime minister still seems to be denying there will be cuts, but the NHS executive has hired management consultants in London to work with trusts and primary care trusts on 25% and 20% cuts respectively (one hopes, by reference to spending plans!). Is the prime minister dissembling, or is the bureaucratic apparatus of the state acting autonomously, just as the cabinet secretary and others are learning how to make Canadian-style 20% cuts in government budgets courtesy of the Institute for Government, funded by long-serving New Labour minister Lord Sainsbury? Either way, it seems that when the rich mess up, the poor pay. Why do the cuts need to be so big, if the money guaranteed to banks may be needed only in part and on paper? And if it is fully needed, why are we not controlling the banks? OK, tax yields are down. But if this is cyclical, why do we need to end state spending as we know it? There are Conservative answers to the crisis, and we are now getting them. What we might have hoped for from Labour is more than their own version &quot;with a human face&quot; (an original description for Lord Mandelson). But then, without a Third Way that was more than &quot;stilts on nonsense&quot; (to reverse Peter Self&apos;s metaphor), their house was built on sand."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/26/family-home-relationships", "sentences": ["Aside from a few liberating tears between Brisbane and Singapore as the weight of what I&apos;d suspected for nearly 30 years finally and somewhat belatedly sunk in - in 1980 my mother returned to Australia from England, leaving me with my father - by the time we took off for Abu Dhabi, I&apos;d already moved on to a triple bill of Jennifer Aniston movies."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "Kathryn Flett on going back home", "tags": ["Family", "Relationships", "Weddings", "Marriage", "Life and style"], "article": "Of course I didn&apos;t run.

Jackson, high on an unbeatable exhaustion/ sugar-rush combo, was busy testing my patience when I heard Mum hiss at him: &quot;Didn&apos;t your mother teach you good manners?&quot;, to which my response was: &quot;You have to earn the right to talk to him like that - he doesn&apos;t know you. And of course I&apos;ve taught him good manners ... &quot; and I sighed and swiftly poured myself another glass of wine and turned to Rob and said: &quot;It&apos;s not like having a mother, it&apos;s like meeting somebody every few years whom one was once very fond of as a child.&quot;  Rob smiled and nodded, unfazed, and my mother, who couldn&apos;t hear this, separated as we were by so many things (but, at this point, mostly a vast glass vase containing what looked like the contents of a lava lamp but which was in fact a cold, blue, inedible jelly - the wedding theme was &quot;winter&quot;, as in Narnia, complete with a Cair Paravel of a cake), continued to glare at us, even as my brother and new sister-in-law Felicity winked and grinned at me in the background. They were clearly having a great time, which was as it should be.  There was no honeymoon, though the newlyweds had taken a few days off work and I had nursed a cosy fantasy of some meals - a meal?! - being cooked en famille. But in reality this was absurd - I don&apos;t even know if my brother and sister-in-law cook, while my mother hasn&apos;t made me a meal since the early 1990s. To them I&apos;m known as the-picker-up-of-tabs-in-restaurants.  So the next day we went out for fish and chips followed by a visit to the slots in Surfers (Mum looked appalled, the kids had a ball). &quot;Call if you want to meet up tomorrow ... &quot; I said to Mum as we parted in the early evening, but I knew she wouldn&apos;t.  The following morning, ticking off the koalas-kangaroos-and-crocs part of his My Australian Adventure school project, Jackson and I went to a nature reserve, which was such fun I had lost track of the time until Jonny called to say Mum&apos;s flight was leaving earlier than he&apos;d thought. We met for a late-afternoon coffee, then drove to the airport for some polite but desultory farewells, after which I felt considerably lighter inside. Three days later, while Jonny was driving Jackson and me to the airport, his mobile rang. Felicity answered, and spoke briefly. &quot;Who was that?&quot; asked my brother. &quot;Your mum,&quot; said Felicity. &quot;She&apos;ll call back.&quot; Ah, that&apos;s nice, I thought. But after we&apos;d arrived and a passer-by had taken a few hasty snaps of us, it slowly dawned on me that when my mother had told Felicity she&apos;d call back, she had quite obviously meant she&apos;d call Jonny and Felicity back, not - as I had rather foolishly assumed - me and Jackson. After all, why bother saying goodbye to two people who, in so many ways, live at the far periphery of your life? Aside from a few liberating tears between Brisbane and Singapore as the weight of what I&apos;d suspected for nearly 30 years finally and somewhat belatedly sunk in - in 1980 my mother returned to Australia from England, leaving me with my father - by the time we took off for Abu Dhabi, I&apos;d already moved on to a triple bill of Jennifer Aniston movies. Hey, whatever it takes. In real life a happy ending is rarely a movie-style &quot;happy ending&quot; or even the one you&apos;d write yourself, given the chance.

And then it&apos;s about walking away without looking back. I&apos;ve written quite a bit recently about notions of &quot;home&quot;, and though I&apos;m still not sure where mine is, exactly, it took a journey of 20,000 miles (and then some) for me to learn, finally, where it is not. kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/26/olympics-2012-grassroots-sports", "sentences": ["The important thing is judge the legacy in the terms in which we promised it in Singapore,&quot; she said."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-26T20:25:09Z", "title": "Olympics legacy under pressure as sceptics question bold promises", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "London", "UK news", "Sport", "Regeneration", "Communities", "Society", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "When Boris Johnson declared, tongue planted firmly in cheek and to cheers from British officials, that &quot;ping pong is coming home&quot; in the wake of the Beijing games, this probably wasn&apos;t exactly what he had in mind. According to the latest quarterly tracking figures from Sport England, progress in using the 2012 Olympics as the catalyst to boost grassroots participation appears to have stalled. Of 31 sports, measured according to how many people played them at least once a week, only table tennis recorded an increase. Nine \u2013 including football, rugby and gymnastics \u2013 showed a decline. Sport England claims the quarterly numbers are meant only as a guide and stresses that the effects of a new plan to funnel \u00a3480m into grassroots sports through their governing bodies over the next four years will not show up in the figures until the next annual survey in December. But the figures were seized on by those who claim ambitious plans to use the Olympics to improve the health of the nation require a drastic rethink. The government claims, with some justification, that it has poured more money into sport than any previous administration. But its critics say that in attempting to yoke the 2012 Olympics to a fundamental shift in the nation&apos;s attitude to sport and the transformation of the grassroots sport it has bitten off more than it can chew. The government&apos;s headline pledge is to get a million more people playing sport three times or more a week, and a million more people engaged in more broadly defined &quot;physical exercise&quot; three times or more a week. The latter target provoked some mirth when the boundaries were quietly expanded to include gardening and &quot;active conservation&quot;. Critics of the targets also claim that the focus on getting those already exercising to do more often ignores the bigger challenge of reaching out to those who have given up altogether. Brigid Simmonds, chair of the CCPR, the umbrella organisation for hundreds of governing bodies, said that more needed to be done to spread the best ideas throughout the country. &quot;What we really need is a sharing of the best ideas, so that if something works well in Plymouth then Preston get to know about it. We&apos;re not talking about schoolchildren or those already involved in sport, we&apos;re talking about people who aren&apos;t doing any physical activity.&quot; The British Olympic Association chief executive, Andy Hunt. has claimed the plans &quot;are not thought through&quot;, provoking the ire of government. But now it is understood that the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, will respond by proposing a new team, led by a high profile figure, to co-ordinate the national grassroots sport initiative. Sport England, the body tasked with delivering half of the 2 million target, feels some exasperation at the latest bout of criticism. It believes it should be judged from here on in and claims to have already delivered a 500,000-increase in participation between 2005-06 and 2007-08, which will not count towards the final total. A new plan to funnel its \u00a3480m investment through the governing bodies, monitored by a range of targets, began earlier this year and runs to 2013. It also points to schemes such as Sport Unlimited, a \u00a336m programme aimed at youngsters not naturally attracted to sport. Over three years, it aims to bring 900,000 young people to sport. Jennie Price, the Sport England chief executive, said she remained confident. &quot;Sport is rising to the challenge of changing the population&apos;s sporting behaviours, creating more opportunities for people to play and enjoy grassroots sport,&quot; she said. &quot;We are working with the governing bodies to provide them with the support and insight they need to build upon the participation increases achieved over the last two years.&quot; The Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell ,argued: &quot;It&apos;s a bit like saying you expect a child of five to be able to do all their GCSEs and get university entrance. The legacy is, by definition, not delivered until 2012 and after.&quot; The government points to the qualified success of its \u00a3140m free swimming initiative, where new figures show 4.4 million &quot;free swims&quot; have been taken by under-16s and over-60s since April. But about a quarter of local authorities are still to sign up and critics say the scheme is unlikely to lead to lasting improvements in facilities. Jowell, meanwhile, is keen to highlight the advances made in school sport, where progress is being made towards the government&apos;s target of five hours of sport a week for all children of school age. In seven years, the percentage of children playing two hours of sport has gone from 23% to more than 90%. &quot;There are two elements to this. What we in government can do is work with the sporting structures to make sure they&apos;re fit for purpose and make sure those who want to take up sport and physical activity can do so. What we can&apos;t do is motivate people to seize those opportunities. But the Olympics can.&quot; But Kate Hoey, the former sports minister who is now the London mayor&apos;s adviser on sport and attempting to deliver a legacy for the capital through programmes such as street athletics and mobile swimming pools, is one of those who believes too much has been claimed on behalf of the games. &quot;We had to do all that to win it, but that probably gave people a grossly inflated idea of what the Olympics could achieve. The Olympics is first and foremost about elite sport and we can&apos;t forget that.&quot; For all the schemes, and the undoubted progress among school age children, there is little sense yet that public enthusiasm for the Olympics will translate to an increased desire to take up sport. They are far more likely to ask when tickets will be on sale than why their local leisure centre is dilapidated and expensive. &quot;There are two problems with this area. The first is the lack of a proper co-ordinated strategy and the second is the lack of money,&quot; said the shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson. Jowell and Sutcliffe scoff at Tory claims of lack of investment, but even among those charged with delivering the legacy \u2013 the governing bodies \u2013 there is some scepticism about whether the plan will work. Others believe more bold ideas are required. Adrian Moorhouse, the former Olympic swimmer and now chief executive of performance management company Lane4, suggests that the NHS should be explicitly linked to the games with the same profile as a top sponsor, to cement the link between health and the games. The Liberal Democrat Olympic spokesman, Tom Brake, said time was running out: &quot;Alarm bells must be ringing in government now. Three years is a very short time to turn around people&apos;s habits and people&apos;s habits are more and more sedentary and less and less active.&quot; Jowell insists all is on track. &quot;We know the legacy will be delivered, but it has not yet been achieved. The important thing is judge the legacy in the terms in which we promised it in Singapore,&quot; she said. &quot;People are making up their own version of the legacy that is limitless and infinite, an end to unhappiness, poverty and strife. Our legacy promises were that we would regenerate the East End of London and we would transform a generation of young people through sport. We&apos;re going further than that promise by saying that by 2012 there will be 1 million more people playing sport and one million more people physically active. It&apos;s deliberately ambitious.&quot; As ministers and Olympic officials tomorrow celebrate the latest milestone by taking the so-called &quot;javelin train&quot; from King&apos;s Cross to Stratford, where they will tour a site that is taking shape at astonishing speed, the din of the construction work won&apos;t be able to drown out the increasingly loud questions about the bold legacy promises made four years ago \u2011 and due to be delivered in just three."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/26/olympics-2012-regeneration-east-end", "sentences": ["What was promised in Singapore in 2005 was bolder still \u2013 to use the London games to completely overhaul a rundown corner of east London and boost employment, raise ambitions and change lives."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-26T21:08:28Z", "title": "After the Olympic games: Tough task to change the outlook in east London", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Olympics & the media", "London", "Regeneration", "Sport", "UK news", "Politics", "Society", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Barcelona stands alone among modern Olympic hosts in succeeding in using the games to not only boost its profile and host the biggest sporting show on earth but to regenerate rundown parts of the city. What was promised in Singapore in 2005 was bolder still \u2013 to use the London games to completely overhaul a rundown corner of east London and boost employment, raise ambitions and change lives. At the heart of the bid that won the games for London was a vow not only to change the nation&apos;s attitude to sport but to &quot;transform the East End&quot;. When Rio, Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid line up to contest the 2016 bid later this year, there will be echoes of London&apos;s pitch in all of them. In the battle to secure political and public backing for the games once won, the argument that they could provide an engine for wholesale redevelopment of one of the most deprived parts of the capital was regularly heard. &quot;I remain supremely confident that in the summer of 2012 we will wow the world with a spectacular fortnight of great sport, entertainment and fun,&quot; said London mayor Boris Johnson ahead of milestone. &quot;However, I am extremely proud that, even now, the world can witness the immense skills and technical expertise that is transforming a wasteland into a brand-new quarter for our great city in breathtaking time.&quot; Those constructing the venues say thinking about what they will be used for afterwards has been built into the planning in a way no previous games has managed. The Olympic Delivery Authority chairman, John Armitt, said: &quot;How people judge the London Olympics in 2020 is the most important thing. We want them to feel that the games left a lasting legacy and not just a two-week party.&quot; The Olympic Park Legacy Company chaired by Lady Ford, the former English Partnerships chair who oversaw the sale that transformed the Millennium Dome to the successful O2, and due to be headed by chief executive Andrew Altman, an American whose redevelopment work in Washington DC has been lauded, will have to hit the ground running when it officially begins work in October. Ford has caused ripples by suggesting she will look again at plans to reduce the \u00a3538m stadium to a 25,000-capacity athletics stadium immediately after the games. She wants to keep the idea of it remaining at 55,000 or 80,000 open while options including the 2018 football World Cup bid are explored. Robertson believes the idea of a Premier League football club becoming the anchor tenant for the stadium must be re-explored if the park is to be economically viable. But Jowell is firmly against reopening that debate, insisting the plan for a 25,000-seat capacity athletics stadium is the right one. Ford has also called for big ideas and bold thinking to make the park attractive enough to draw visitors from around London and the rest of the country and has talked ambitiously about it becoming the equivalent of New York&apos;s Central Park, with sport at its heart. The project will take decades rather than years but there is also an acknowledgement that temporary reasons will have to be found to keep the park busy and interesting in order to avoid a post-games lull. But significant tensions bubble away beneath the surface. The surrounding boroughs are adamant that they don&apos;t want to be saddled with the costs of running venues that will almost certainly require ongoing subsidy. Instead, Ford will look for commercial partners and anchor tenants. Newham&apos;s mayor, Sir Robin Wales, is still sore about the decision not to include a leisure pool element within the spectacular \u00a3244m Aquatics Centre and angry that local boroughs have not been consulted about the mix of housing within the \u00a31.1bn athletes&apos; village that will host 17,000 athletes during the games and be converted into flats afterwards. The ODA and the boroughs are agreed that the venues and park in themselves will not drive regeneration. More important for Wales is the focus and attention the Olympics has brought to the area and the possibility of using it as a tool to create jobs and bridge the gap with more prosperous parts of the capital. &quot;As far as I&apos;m aware, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s ever changed a local community. But it does get your attention and you need to grab the attention,&quot; said Wales. &quot;Will we succeed? We have a chance. It&apos;s up to us to seize the moment.&quot; Jowell is adamant that the \u00a3350m allocated within the \u00a39.3bn budget to transform the park for post-games use will be sufficient. &quot;Of course there will be a sense of anti-climax when the games have ended,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s when the excitement of recasting this park as a national destination for sport, leisure, culture and business starts. We have already anticipated the legacy needs in a way no other Olympic city has.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/27/aung-san-suu-kyi-burma-asean", "sentences": ["The idea, suggested by parliamentarians from Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, of suspending Burma&apos;s membership was rejected by Thailand&apos;s prime minister, the current Asean chairman.", "Up to now, the junta has survived thanks to support from China and Russia in the UN security council, and the cynical scramble for Burma&apos;s rich natural resources which has united India, Thailand and Singapore with China and Russia."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T09:00:01Z", "title": "Asean's Burmese diplomacy has failed | Tom Fawthrop", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "Thailand", "Human rights", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "The bizarre and protracted trial of Aung San Suu Kyi has just heard the final arguments of the prosecution and defence. The verdict \u2013 not expected for another month \u2013 will not only decide the fate of Burma&apos;s iconic opposition leader, who has been held under house arrest for the best part of 19 years, but will cast a decisive shadow over elections scheduled for 2010.  During the recent visit of UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon, junta chief General Tan Shwe promised free and fair elections next year. Indonesia&apos;s foreign minister Dr Hassan Wirajuda has made it clear that Burma must release Suu Kyi if those elections are to be credible. Attending ARF, the Asean regional forum in Phuket, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton informed the Burmese delegation that any US offer to improve relations is dependent on releasing Suu Kyi and other political prisoners. And what happens if \u2013 as most observers expect \u2013 she is perversely found guilty of violating her conditions of house arrest, all because of a mysterious intrusion from an uninvited American guest? Burma&apos;s opposition has already predicted a guilty verdict, expecting the judge to send her to prison or renew her detention order for another five years, thus denying her any role in next year&apos;s elections. So what will Asean do about their recalcitrant member? Not too much hope should be placed in the newly approved human rights provision of the Asean charter. The human rights commission has no power to monitor violations, and Burma participated in efforts to water down the provisions to exclude any monitoring or investigation. Although the Indonesian foreign minister has expressed anger, the misgivings of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, expressed through softly-softly diplomacy known as &quot;constructive engagement&quot; with the regime, have so far made no difference. If anything, it has become routine at major Asean conferences for the Burmese delegation to deflect criticism and carry on as usual. The club of south-east Asian nations operates by consensus and shrinks from suggestions that Burma should either be expelled or suspended. The idea, suggested by parliamentarians from Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, of suspending Burma&apos;s membership was rejected by Thailand&apos;s prime minister, the current Asean chairman. &quot;There are not enough grounds to do that,&quot; he said. Since 1997, when Burma joined Asean, the military regime has been accused of forced labour, systematic torture of political prisoners and shooting protesting monks. Thailand has been flooded with political refugees, especially ethnic minorities such as Karen and Shan, fleeing the burning and pillaging of the Burmese military offensives. A recent report from Harvard law school calls for the UN security council to establish an investigation into crimes against humanity and war crimes in Burma. Whether or not Burma should be suspended from Asean is one issue, but to suggest there are not enough grounds to even consider it is an insult to the endless sufferings of the Burmese people which Asean has singularly failed to alleviate. Asean&apos;s leaders are quick to point out the failure of western sanctions and the futility of isolating a paranoid regime which has already withdrawn Burma&apos;s capital from Rangoon to the newly-built secret citadel of Naypidaw, designed to be a &quot;foreigner-free zone&quot;. But it is clear Asean&apos;s policy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; has equally failed to move Burma&apos;s generals away from their bunker mentality and convince them of the need for a transition towards democracy. Asean has of course called for Suu Kyi&apos;s release. But if the junta takes no notice and the court finds her guilty, after the usual round of polite protest, nothing will happen \u2013 it will be business as usual. Indeed those who condemn western sanctions are also countries involved in trade and investment in Burma. A Thai Democrat MP, Kraisak Choonhavan, concerned that his country has not done enough for human rights in Burma, says one reason is &quot;Thailand is the number one investor in natural gas. We pay 16bn baht a year to Burma.&quot; He would like to see his government impose ethical and good governance practices on state enterprises doing business across the border. The real issue, however, is not sanctions or engagement, but the type of sanctions, and the terms of engagement. But as long as Asean engages in unconditional diplomacy, sanctions are necessary to indicate the diplomatic rejection of a brutal regime. Up to now, the junta has survived thanks to support from China and Russia in the UN security council, and the cynical scramble for Burma&apos;s rich natural resources which has united India, Thailand and Singapore with China and Russia. Suu Kyi will continue to languish behind bars (or under house arrest) as long as pressure on the generals is constantly deflected by the competing greed of these nations."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2009/jul/27/olympics-legacy-vision-short-sighted", "sentences": ["Sebastian Coe, head of London&apos;s bid, and Tony Blair, the prime minister, charmed the International Olympic Committee audience with that promise in Singapore four years ago, but both men really ought to have known better."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T13:08:28Z", "title": "London Olympics legacy vision will ultimately prove to be short-sighted | David Conn", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "It was the claim which won London the 2012 Olympics, that the Games, in British hands, would &quot;inspire a generation to greater sporting activity&quot; - but it was also the claim which should never have been made. Sebastian Coe, head of London&apos;s bid, and Tony Blair, the prime minister, charmed the International Olympic Committee audience with that promise in Singapore four years ago, but both men really ought to have known better. The Government&apos;s own sports strategy document, Game Plan, concluded in 2002 that staging the Olympics was unlikely to address our modern health problems, caused by sedentary lifestyles and poor diet. &quot;Hosting events is not an effective, value for money method of achieving a sustained increase in participation,&quot; the government&apos;s document said, concluding there was &quot;limited evidence&quot; of the benefits of &quot;mega sporting events.&quot; Yet still the claims were made. Research from previous Olympics has shown that while people generally do love watching great athletes run round tracks or swim impossibly fast, they are not then inspired to take up sport themselves. The reasons why some people are physically active and others are not are rooted in their social, cultural and economic circumstances, not because they do not have enough opportunities to watch elite athletes on television or in a stadium. In Britain, we have a big problem: official figures show that a dismal one in five people, 21%, do half an hour&apos;s moderate exercise - including walking - three times a week. We invest much less in sport per head than other developed countries including Finland, where a public health programme begun in 1972 gradually transformed the population into the world&apos;s most active, where 55% of people exercise three times a week or more. Coe, lucky for him, is not responsible for making good on the legacy claim. As the chairman of Locog, he will be judged on whether the Games themselves are a success in 2012. Responsibility for the very difficult target of seeing a million more people doing sport by then, has fallen to Sport England. Good intentions do abound to improve sports provision and facilities, and to use the power of the Olympics to inspire young people. Advocates for the Olympics argue that, importantly, winning the Games has raised sport&apos;s profile generally and focused minds in the government and local authorities on the need to improve participation. Strides are being made in schools, where the Labour government has committed \u00a32.3bn to revitalising sport from 2003-11, in a sustained effort to recover from years of desperate underfunding by the previous Conservative government. Now, 90% of pupils do the set two hours PE a week, a wholesale improvement following the wretched decline under the Conservatives. Outside schools, Sport England has allocated \u00a3480m of lottery and treasury funding over the next four years to 46 sports, which have developed &quot;whole sport plans&quot; to boost numbers. The free swimming for over 65s initiative has been backed by \u00a3140m government cash. Yet all of that still amounts to a fraction of the \u00a39.3bn budget just for hosting the Olympics. Although some of the facilities will be available for ordinary people to use afterwards, such as the aquatic centre, the Games have actually sucked money away from public sport - \u00a3547m was diverted from Sport England&apos;s budget. The heart of the matter is that particularly after young people leave school, their physical health, and whether they are likely to continue to take part in sport, depends greatly on wealth and education. The poor are stubbornly less active than the relatively well off, for a range of reasons which are obvious to identify \u2013 low income, limited horizons, poor neighbourhoods, bad diet, rundown local sports facilities \u2013 but tough to address without real political will. That is the key reason why we compare so badly to Finland and the other Scandinavian countries: ours is a more unequal society. Our figure of 21% doing regular exercise has barely moved since 1990. Sport England registered an increase between 2006 and 2008, but the most recent figures are static or, in some sports, down. That wider social inequality, which underpins the divide between those who have always participated in sport, like Coe, and those who generally do not, is the truly difficult challenge for politicians to address. It is much easier to charm an IOC audience with a legacy vision, when bidding to host the Games. Efforts are undoubtedly being made, yet the Olympics in London are unlikely to inspire a new generation to be more active, unless accompanied by huge investment and determination. For three weeks in the summer of 2012, though, watching top athletes achieve great things will make a lot of people feel better about life, at least for a while."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/jul/27/obituary-guy-stringer", "sentences": ["In Singapore, Stringer hired a barge the size of a football pitch, and filled it with rice and basic supplies."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T17:33:48Z", "title": "Guy Stringer | Obituary", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 3 August 2009 The obituary below said that Guy Stringer, born in Stone, was from the Potteries. Stone is in Staffordshire, but not in the Potteries. Guy Stringer, director of Oxfam from 1983 to 1985, who has died aged 88, pulled off one of the most extraordinary humanitarian feats: an aid excursion that he described after the event as &quot;a slow boat to Indo-China, or the most expensive cruise in the world&quot;. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 to expel the murderous Pol Pot, cold war politics meant that the international community treated the replacement client regime as illegal. Food shortages threatened millions of Cambodians, but the pariah state obstructed the monitored provision of international relief. With the UN humanitarian system stopped in its tracks, Stringer, then Oxfam&apos;s deputy director, was sent to south-east Asia to see what Oxfam could do. He later wrote: &quot;I had a briefcase, $50,000 and one introduction to a shipping man,&quot; and doubted whether any other organisation in the world would send its servants on such an enterprise in so nonchalant a fashion. In Singapore, Stringer hired a barge the size of a football pitch, and filled it with rice and basic supplies. Braving the monsoon, pirates, and a hostile reception, the loaded vessel was tugged at a snail&apos;s pace up the Gulf of Siam. Stringer was later asked by Oxfam to reimburse the cost of the deckchair he purchased to sit on during the voyage. After skirmishes with the port authorities in K\u00e2mp\u00f3ng Sa\u00f4m, the cargo was amicably discharged at its Cambodian destination. Stringer was the first to acknowledge the expedition&apos;s combination of naivety, flair and bravado. Not only did it succeed against all odds, but the worldwide publicity given to the aid flotilla helped break the logjam facing international relief into Phnom Penh. This was arguably the finest hour of non-governmental international humanitarian intervention. Nothing so imaginative and unconventional would be attempted by Oxfam today. Stringer was born in the Potteries \u2013 at Stone, Staffordshire \u2013 where his father ran a ceramics business in Hanley and his mother taught history at the local grammar school. Educated at prep school and Sedbergh school in Cumbria, he deferred his place to read history at Cambridge University and volunteered for the army when the war started. Sent to India and Burma in 1941, he joined the Chindits special force under Orde Wingate and was a major by the age of 21. After being injured by mortar fire, he returned to the UK in poor health. Stringer then accepted a commission and a place at the Royal Military Coll- ege of Science. While stationed in the meantime at the small arms school in Hythe, Kent, he met Mary Symonds and fell in love; within three days she had accepted his proposal. Stringer resigned his commission in 1953, but was recalled to the regiment and sent to Korea as part of the UN force. Deeply disenchanted with its huge loss of life and pointlessness, he left the army in 1954. Returning to the UK, he joined the family business as the sales representative for Kent. In 1955 the family business failed, but Stringer went on to help turn around the fortunes of a small, virtually bankrupt ceramic tile business in Dorset. He joined Oxfam in 1969 in the specially created post of commercial director, at a time when his most recent enterprise had been sold and he was on the lookout for change. Mary converted him to the organisation: she ran an early Oxfam shop in Dorset. A bluff, good-hearted person who described himself as &quot;a commercial man with a conscience&quot;, Stringer remained startled that he had been persuaded to abandon a successful business career to work at a fraction of the salary for an organisation that could seem wilful and problematic. His commitment to sound business enterprise and efficient marketing could, at times, sit uneasily with ideologies then coming into vogue, including the gospel of &quot;fair trade&quot; and, at the more radical end of the spectrum, Paulo Freire&apos;s &quot;conscientisation&quot; and Julius Nyerere&apos;s African socialism \u2013 whose proponents Guy listened to patiently, if with some dismay. His military background, too, could jar with many senior staff members, who had spent the war in the Friends&apos; Relief Service, driving ambulances along the Burma Road. Stringer undertook many field visits, and was a fundraising genius whose conviction and eloquence never dimmed. Stringer made his most important contribution to the still embryonic organisation, and to a number of other idealistic ventures with which Oxfam was associated: New Internationalist magazine, started up in the 1970s with Oxfam and Christian Aid assistance, would not have survived without his mentorship and support. As commercial director, and deputy director from 1971, Stringer established trading operations on commercially sound foundations, without compromising the organisation&apos;s demanding code of ethics. The development of Oxfam shops, the import of handicrafts as a trading partnership, and an early venture in large-scale recycling were among his many initiatives. He was a natural leader, funny and wise, and held in huge affection by hundreds of staff and supporters. In 1983, he was appointed director of Oxfam, holding the post until retirement in 1985. He was appointed CBE the following year. Stringer detested arrogance and self-satisfaction. He always pointed out that Oxfam was, in the end, an organisation &quot;situated above a laundry on the Banbury Road&quot;, and that &quot;there&apos;s no magical right for Oxfam to continue&quot;. Oxfam has evolved beyond recognition. In the solidity of its fund-raising, managerial and operational base lies the invisible debt he is owed, even if the captaincy of a 1,500-ton barge called Asiatic Success is the feat for which he has passed into Oxfam legend. Mary died in 2002. He is survived by his children, Prue, Sarah, Dick and Charles.  \u2022 Anthony Guy Stringer, entrepreneur and director of Oxfam, born 3 October 1920; died 4 July 2009 \u2022 This article was amended on 28 July 2009.

We should have made clear that this is a claim, so far unverified by the US military.   The trial of Burma&apos;s pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi ended today with the judge announcing he will deliver his verdict by the end of the week. The Nobel peace prize laureate is charged with breaking the terms of her house arrest by allowing an American man to spend two nights at her home in May. She faces up to five years in prison if found guilty. Last-ditch attempts to call Nyunt Maung Shein, Burma&apos;s former ambassador to the UN, to testify in court were rejected. Government officials and diplomats said the judge, Thaung Nyunt, had ended the trial and announced there would be a ruling on Friday. There has been little word yet on today&apos;s proceedings. The media have been banned from the most of the trial, although diplomats from Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the US were allowed to attend today. An official told Reuters that Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s trial had been completed, but cases against three other defendants were continuing. &quot;We have done our best and she is prepared for the worst,&quot; her lawyer, Nyan Win, told reporters. &quot;We don&apos;t want to speculate, but we will keep exploring all legal avenues.&quot; The end of the trial came as Amnesty International awarded Aung San Suu Kyi its highest accolade, the title of ambassador of conscience, for leading the democracy struggle in Burma. &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi has remained a symbol of hope, courage and the undying defence of human rights, not only to the people of Myanmar but to people around the world,&quot; Amnesty&apos;s secretary general, Irene Khan, said. The rock band U2 was due to announce the award at a concert in Dublin last night. John Yettaw, a Vietnam veteran who was described by his wife as eccentric, said he swam across a lake to her home because he wanted to warn her that she was about to be assassinated by &quot;terrorists&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained for 14 of the past 20 years, pleaded with Yettaw to leave and relented only after he claimed to be too ill to swim back. Reports said Yettaw&apos;s lawyer was due to defend his client against charges of trespassing, which carries a sentence of up to three months in prison. Khin Maung Oo said at the weekend that he would attempt to win Yettaw, 53, a lenient sentence. &quot;I will try my best to defend my client. I will argue that he did not violate the restriction order and I will try my utmost to get him lesser punishment,&quot; he said. Critics have denounced the trial as an excuse by Burma&apos;s ruling military junta to keep Aung San Suu Kyi incarcerated during national elections due next year. Her party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide victory in elections in 1990, but the ruling generals refused to recognise the result. The junta has so far resisted international calls for her immediate release. Last week, the state-controlled media accused the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, of &quot;interference&quot; after she said a satisfactory conclusion to the trial could lead to better economic ties with Washington. The defence does not deny that Yettaw visited Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s compound, but argues that she cannot be charged under laws abolished in 1988. It blames her bodyguards for failing to apprehend Yettaw, who remained undetected for several hours."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/28/rolls-royce-to-open-four-factories", "sentences": ["Rolls-Royce is also building a factory in Singapore to construct fan blades used in military and commercial aircraft engines."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-28T13:45:03Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce announces \u00a3300m UK factory plan", "tags": ["Rolls-Royce", "Technology", "Engineering", "Nuclear power", "Aeronautics", "Business", "Politics", "Peter Mandelson", "UK news"], "article": "Engineering firm Rolls-Royce has given Britain&apos;s industrial sector a much-needed fillip by announcing it will open four new factories in the UK, creating or saving 800 jobs.

Building the factories will cost Rolls-Royce \u00a3300m, with the government contributing \u00a345m. Three of them will develop aerospace technologies. A fourth will assemble and test parts for new nuclear power stations. Sites for the four plants have not been disclosed, but they will all be in &quot;assisted areas&quot; \u2013 parts of the UK with high unemployment.

It was at that point that Meir Amit, chief of the Israeli secret service Mossad, who has died aged 88, flew back from Washington with vital news for the Israeli prime minister, Levi Eshkol. Thanks to Amit&apos;s powers of persuasion, the US had agreed to sanction an Israeli pre-emptive strike. The result was the six-day war, one of the most astonishing military victories in history. The Mossad chief would later deny that he had provoked an attack or used deception to coax Jordan into the conflict to acquire the West Bank for Israel. He modernised Israel&apos;s intelligence services, championed her information revolution and became a respected strategic analyst. Born Meir Slutzky in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee, at 15 he joined the Labour movement&apos;s Haganah underground militia (his mother, Haya, was a party activist) to defend Jewish communities in clashes with Arab neighbours. He lived on a kibbutz for 13 years, though for decades his principal base was the family home in Tel Aviv. In 1948, with Israeli independence, he led units of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) against Iraqi and Syrian invading forces. Once his cigarette case deflected a bullet, saving him from serious injury. A natural leader and respected tactician, Amit became commander of the Golani Brigade and in 1951 became head of operations of the IDF. In 1954 he took a British officer&apos;s training course. As aide-de-camp to chief of staff Moshe Dayan, he was associated with several allegedly overzealous cross-border &quot;reprisals&quot;, and together they planned Israel&apos;s successful 1956 Sinai campaign. He then studied economics and business at Columbia University, New York, before joining Aman, Israel&apos;s military intelligence agency, becoming its head in 1962. But there were troubles in the hidden world of espionage. Despite masterminding the kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann in Argentina in 1960, Isser Harel, boss of Mossad, was losing his touch. Amit criticised him for obsessively tracking down Nazi scientists supposedly working for Cairo. When Egypt publicly test-fired ballistic missiles in July 1962, Amit fumed: &quot;What are we spending our intelligence budget on? All we need is a portable radio!&quot; In 1963, Amit replaced Harel as head of Mossad, and for nine months, uniquely in Israeli history, he overlapped the position with directorship of Aman. Many pro-Harel agents, such as future prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, left Mossad in disgust. Nonetheless, Amit introduced US-style management techniques, installed computers, pioneered links with foreign agencies, and shrewdly incorporated elite undercover agents from Aman into Mossad. One Amir-run Mossad spy, Eli Cohen, sent Jerusalem detailed dossiers on Arab strengths and weaknesses from Damascus. Cohen inveigled himself into Syria&apos;s military establishment and was even tipped to become a deputy defence minister before he was unmasked in 1965 and executed. But the intelligence provided by Cohen, and Wolfgang Lotz in Cairo, proved invaluable in the 1967 war. Amit desperately wanted Israel to escape the straitjacket of regional isolation. To this end he forged ties with potential allies in Africa and Asia such as Kenya, Uganda, Singapore, Iran, India, Turkey and Indonesia. Amit warned Jordan&apos;s King Hussein of a possible coup, claimed to see the Shah each month, visited the CIA director Richard Helms at his home, and channelled arms to Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq, whose leader Mullah Mustafa Barzani he befriended. &quot;Personal contacts can solve most problems,&quot; he later told a television reporter. He also helped Morocco&apos;s security services, although the Arab kingdom was officially at war with Israel. In October 1965, Mossad was embroiled in the gunning down in Paris of a Moroccan dissident, Mehdi Ben-Barka, leading a furious De Gaulle to close the agency&apos;s European headquarters. Even the former Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion called it &quot;contemptible&quot;. Amit redeemed himself in 1966 by organising the defection to Israel of an Iraqi Christian pilot, Captain Munir Redfa. Israel invited CIA experts to pore over Redfa&apos;s captured MiG-21 fighter jet, a mainstay of the Soviet Air Force. This act cemented Israeli-US relations just as regional tensions were mounting. Even so, Amit detected hints of an Egyptian thaw. In 1966 he was about to negotiate directly in Cairo with President Nasser&apos;s deputy, Field Marshal Abdel-Hakim Amer, when Eshkol&apos;s office vetoed the scheme. Had this meeting taken place, Amit claimed, conflict could have been averted. As it was, in 1967 Amit told US leaders during his visit to Washington that war was inevitable, would last a week and exact fewer casualties than in 1948 \u2013 predictions which proved uncannily accurate. On 3 June he assured Eshkol: &quot;They won&apos;t sit in mourning if Israel fires the first shot.&quot; Two days later, Israel destroyed Egypt&apos;s air force on the ground, and quadrupled its land area. Wary of Amit&apos;s growing autonomy, Eshkol sacked him in 1968 and the spy-master spent the next nine years as managing director of Koor Industries, the largest conglomerate in Israel. In 1976 Amit left the Labour party to co-found the Democratic Movement for Change. He infuriated Labour friends by joining Israel&apos;s first Likud-led cabinet as minister for transport in 1977. But Amit soon deserted the government for the liberal opposition Shinui (Change) party, eventually rejoining Labour in 1980. With his political capital spent, he devoted his remaining years to developing communication satellites, such as Amos, from which the New York Times is printed. Amit also became Israel&apos;s most devoted private collector of dolls, a hobby he began after receiving a gift from an Arab country. He built a collection of 1,500 toys gleaned from every nation he visited. Invariably discreet about past actions, in his 1999 memoirs, Rosh Be-Rosh (Head to Head), Amit likened information given away to &quot;Samson&apos;s hair before it is cut&quot;. Until Israel achieved real peace, he believed, there was no substitute for vigilance, and intelligence that compensated for Israel&apos;s lack of strategic and geographical depth. Yet his fears grew with time. In 2006 he said that apparently co-ordinated terror attacks denoted a world &quot;on the eve of world war three&quot;; he warned of the global imposition of &quot;the Islamic idea&quot;. And in 2007 he advocated that the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should &quot;be made to disappear&quot;, adding that if he wanted &quot;to die a martyr, he should be sent to heaven&quot;. Mostly, though, Amit preferred diplomatic pressure, secret or overt, to assassination. &quot;In intelligence, people are more important than rifles,&quot; said Amit, who is survived by his wife Yona, their three daughters and seven grandchildren. \u2022 Meir Amit (Meir Slutzky), soldier and intelligence chief, born 17 March 1921; died 17 July 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jul/28/newcastle-unitied-mike-ashey-takeover", "sentences": ["The Singapore based investment company was never regarded as a serious contender by either Seymour Pierce or Ashley but nonetheless, Steve McMahon, its commercial director, expressed his disgust with Newcastle yesterday."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-28T21:47:28Z", "title": "Mike Ashley optimistic Newcastle can overcome pitfalls to find summer buyer", "tags": ["Newcastle United", "Mike Ashley", "Championship", "Football", "Sport"], "article": " Mike Ashley remains optimistic about selling Newcastle United by the end of the summer and will resist the temptation to place the troubled Championship club in administration. Although Newcastle&apos;s owner is unpredictable and, in the football sphere at least, has a track record of about-faces, a source close to the club said administration was &quot;the last thing&quot; on Ashley&apos;s mind. Indeed two &quot;very serious&quot; potential buyers are understood to have virtually completed exhaustive due diligence on Newcastle and would be in a position to seal a takeover in around two weeks were they to decide to proceed. With Keith Harris, the executive chairman of the investment bank Seymour Pierce and the man brokering the sale, having now returned from a short break there are no obstacles to a speedy conclusion of the matter. Ashley&apos;s problem, though, is that bidders have had second thoughts after realising the scale of the challenge they would be shouldering at St James&apos; Park. While Newcastle offers immense potential it is currently football&apos;s answer to a once stately home gone to rack and ruin which will prove extremely costly, difficult and potentially emotionally draining to restore. Right now Ashley&apos;s prospective successors are weighing up the benefits of possibly huge long-term gains against considerable short- and medium-term pain. Immediate pitfalls include the annual player wage bill, currently around \u00a365m and far too high for a Championship club, the \u00a340m overdraft, Kevin Keegan&apos;s outstanding constructive dismissal claim which could cost new owners as much as \u00a38m to resolve, a \u00a31m demand from former deputy chairman Douglas Hall and the sum of around \u00a320,000 a week currently payable to ex-director of football Dennis Wise under the terms of his severance agreement. Ashley, who has invested around \u00a3250m in Newcastle including a \u00a3100m interest-free loan, is asking \u00a3100m for the club and continues to hold out for a sum close to that asking price. Were he to place Newcastle in administration \u2013 in which case the Football League would immediately impose a 10-point deduction on the team \u2013 Ashley would be the principal creditor. Although his losses at St James&apos; Park could potentially reduce the multimillionaire sports goods magnate&apos;s overall tax bill, the source stressed he remains committed to recouping some of his investment by finding a buyer. Even so, if one does not materialise by autumn Ashley \u2013 who has currently placed an embargo on all transfer activity in the hope a take-over is completed before the end of August \u2013 will be forced to increase his investment on Tyneside by appointing a manager. One consortium who will not be moving into St James&apos; Park is the Profitable Group. The Singapore based investment company was never regarded as a serious contender by either Seymour Pierce or Ashley but nonetheless, Steve McMahon, its commercial director, expressed his disgust with Newcastle yesterday. Explaining that the Profitable Group had ended its interest in buying the club due to a lack of &quot;communication and response&quot; from Ashley, McMahon&apos;s words proved as hard hitting as some of the tackles the former Liverpool and England midfielder once inflicted on opponents. &quot;We have pulled out, how long can you hang on?,&quot; said McMahon. &quot;We put in a bid two weeks ago and we have had no communications, no response, nothing. It really is poor form from Newcastle. I just feel sorry for the supporters up there. They deserve much, much better.

In 2007 three of the directors of Profitable Group \u2013 Tim Goldring, Nigel Blanchard and Neil Osborn \u2013 were behind the Profitable Plot Company that was the subject of a winding-up petition from the Department of Trade and Industry which was avoided when the company went into voluntary liquidation. One of the Profitable Group&apos;s core businesses in Singapore is Profitable Plots, which purchases UK land and sells shares in it on the promise of enhanced value once planning permission is achieved. After repeated planning-application failures the validity of the scheme has been questioned, upsetting investors in Asia and Canada. Its Canadian client-services manager, Dan Strumos, insists there is nothing untoward since, he says, the Singapore government puts to death anyone guilty of &quot;corporate shenanigans&quot; (although Nick Leeson seems to have survived).

Shearer set for the settee Alan Shearer&apos;s chances of being reinstated as Newcastle United manager are slim enough for the BBC to expect him to be sitting in its studio rather than in the dugout for the opening game of its Football League coverage.

But no one at the corporation expects that to be before his old team head to West Bromwich Albion on 8 August for the first match of the three-year BBC deal. Parry not hurried There are already rumblings of discontent about the government&apos;s sports-betting integrity panel, which is a month old but has yet to hold a formal meeting. Rick Parry, the chair, is sensibly holding individual, private meetings with all 13 representatives from sport and the betting industry who make up the panel, in an effort to discover some common ground as a starting point for discussions. But due to panellists&apos; holiday commitments, formal talks will not take place until the end of August at the earliest \u2013 two months after the launch of the process. The expectation of the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, that the diametric opposites on the panel can be reconciled enough to come up with &quot;a clear set of recommendations&quot; within six months, is looking ever more unrealistic but the government was still sticking to its timetable yesterday.

Critics must be hoping they have disappeared up their own ether. Actually, they are booming. The consultancy kzero.co.uk reports that membership of virtual worlds grew by 39% in the second quarter of 2009 to an estimated 579 million. Not all these members are active but I can&apos;t think of anything, anywhere, that has grown so fast in the recession this side of Goldman Sachs bonuses. There&apos;s another curious thing: Facebook and Twitter are lauded to the skies, but neither has found a way to make money \u2013 whereas virtual worlds such as World of Warcraft, Entropia Universe, Habbo Hotel, Club Penguin and Second Life are all profitable because their business models are based on\u00a0the digital elixir of subscriptions and micropayments, a formula that other websites, including newspapers, would die for. Twitter makes the noise, Second Life makes the money. If you think virtual worlds are a passing fad, look at the figures. Almost all of the 39% growth came from children. Girls used to grow up with their dolls; now they are growing up with their avatars. This goes largely unreported because the users don&apos;t read newspapers, but as Kzero reports, poptropica.com \u2013 aimed at five- to 10-year-olds \u2013 has 76 million registered users. If you move up to 10- to 15-year-olds, users rival the populations of countries \u2013 led by Habbo (135 million), Neopets (54 million), Star Dolls (34 million) and Club Penguin (28 million). It starts tailing off among 15- to 25-year-olds \u2013 apart from Poptropica (35 million) \u2013 but it underlines the likelihood that as youngsters get older they will be looking for more sophisticated outlets and for ways to link existing social networks such as Facebook or MySpace to more immersive virtual worlds. The telephone was a one-to-one experience; email linked friends and colleagues; Facebook extended this to friends of friends but virtual worlds offer \u2013 as Twitter does in a more constrained context \u2013 the opportunity to link with anyone on the planet sharing similar interests. Second Life, once the posterboy of virtual worlds, is consolidating as it tries to make the experience easier and less crash-prone while moving adult content to a separate zone. Only a small fraction of its 19 million registered users are active, but it is still the creative laboratory of the genre. Corporations find it useful for holding international meetings or to recruit staff and educationalists are doing lots of interesting things including language teaching. But Second Life may not end up as the preferred platform as new business models take advantage of the rapidly improving technological developments elsewhere. In order to get a more streamlined experience, most of the new virtual worlds don&apos;t allow users to make their own content. Twinity, which has just raised \u20ac4.5m in new funding, has a virtual version of Berlin and Singapore (with London still in the pipeline): you buy existing apartments or rent shops but can&apos;t build yourself. Bluemarsonline.com \u2013 still in testing mode \u2013 promises much better graphics and more realistic avatars at the expense of not allowing members (as opposed to developers) to create their own content. One problem of virtual worlds is that you can&apos;t go from one to another. But evolver.com enables users to move creations across worlds and OpenSimulator lets you create a virtual world on the hard drive of your own computer, linking to other compatible ones, such as Second Life, if you choose. With technology moving so fast and a whole generation growing up for whom having an avatar is second nature, virtual worlds have nowhere to go but up.

Now the case will centre on whether the state can interfere with Purdy&apos;s right to take decisions about the quality of her life and death."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jul/30/debbie-purdy-legal-victory-dignitas", "sentences": ["Her wanderlust took her to Japan, Hong Kong, Norway and, eventually, Singapore.", "Purdy already had early symptoms of the illness when she met her husband in Singapore while reviewing his salsa band.", "Before she flew back to Singapore she called the Spanish embassy to ask what the word for MS was so she could tell Puente, not knowing what he would think."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-30T22:54:50Z", "title": "Debbie Purdy case: landmark ruling gives couple freedom to get on with their lives", "tags": ["Assisted dying", "Society", "Multiple sclerosis", "Life and style", "Law", "UK news", "Politics", "House of Lords"], "article": "Grinning in the sunshine outside the Houses of Parliament yesterday, Debbie Purdy gripped her husband Omar&apos;s hand and did not let go. She had been fighting for two years to know that she would be able to hold that hand when she died, and with the highest court in the land&apos;s order that the law on assisted suicide must be clarified, that right was a step closer. There were no tears as she and jazz violinist Omar Puente reflected on their landmark legal victory, just broad smiles and a sense of sheer delight. &quot;It&apos;s like having my life back,&quot; said Purdy, who is dying from multiple sclerosis. &quot;If it&apos;s about living life, he&apos;s the reason I live mine.&quot; It is now possible that Puente will be told he will not risk 14 years in jail if he travels with his wife to the Swiss clinic Dignitas, where she wishes to die if her condition worsens. Purdy, 46, who grew up in Berkshire and London, said the judgment had freed her from the constant anxiety that she had to make a decision to go there alone while she was still physically able. &quot;We can live our lives. We don&apos;t have to plan my death. &quot;I think people are beginning to realise it&apos;s not a right to die, it&apos;s a right to live, and a right to live with dignity, and with choice, and to know what your choices are.&quot; &apos;An incredible start&apos; There was one regret: the absence of fellow campaigner Diane Pretty, who died unassisted in 2002, a year after losing her battle to get her husband granted immunity from prosecution if he helped her to die. But the ruling was an &quot;incredible start&quot;, Purdy said, giving the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, an &quot;amazing&quot; opportunity. She was impressed by Starmer&apos;s promise to produce an interim policy for prosecutors by the end of September. &quot;He&apos;s shown a preparedness to act quickly,&quot; Purdy said. &quot;That seems a first for a British anything, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; She also had praise for the five lords who made the decision,: &quot;It is amazing to hear the House of Lords actually listening to the public for once.&quot; Purdy said she would be putting the extra time the ruling gave her to good use, making sure she was part of the forthcoming consultation on the law. &quot;I&apos;m not exactly a retiring, shy person,&quot; she said. Purdy and Cuban-born Puente have been battling her MS since shortly after their relationship began 14 years ago. After quitting her humanities studies at university in Birmingham and working in sales, Purdy began travelling. Her wanderlust took her to Japan, Hong Kong, Norway and, eventually, Singapore. A self-confessed adrenaline junkie who had revelled in travelling the world diving from planes, conquering mountains, trekking through jungles and exploring the depths of the oceans, she earned her living working as a music journalist, waitress, dancer and jewellery seller. Purdy already had early symptoms of the illness when she met her husband in Singapore while reviewing his salsa band. The pair started seeing each other, but when she returned to England soon after, in 1995, an MRI scan revealed the truth about the mysterious sensations she had felt when out dancing with friends in a Yorkshire nightclub \u2013 &quot;like wading through honey&quot; as she later described it. Before she flew back to Singapore she called the Spanish embassy to ask what the word for MS was so she could tell Puente, not knowing what he would think. He was at the airport waiting for her and has not left her side since. Puente was a great support from the moment she was diagnosed, Purdy said. &quot;He didn&apos;t know what MS would entail and neither did I. We needed each other.&quot; The pair spent two years travelling together with his band, and the illness went with them. On one occasion, in 1996, they went scuba diving and as they walked on the beach Puente noticed to his horror that Purdy was leaving bloody footprints in her wake, unaware that her feet were being cut by the shingle. In 1997, her health deteriorating, she decided to return to England, and despite finding the weather somewhat cold and wet for his tastes, Puente came with her. They settled in Bradford and were married the following year. Constant pain By 2001, now using a wheelchair, Purdy had begun to consider euthanasia, inspired by Pretty&apos;s case. She began campaigning on the law soon after, and started her legal action in 2007. The high court&apos;s rejection of her case last October was &quot;a kick in the guts&quot; but there was a glimmer of hope in their allowing of the appeal that bore fruit yesterday. She still enjoys life in her adapted home in Bradford, but is having increasing problems. She uses an electric wheelchair because her arms are no longer strong enough to propel a manual chair, is unable to turn over in bed unaided, and takes painkillers every day. Her feet, swollen by bad circulation, were clad only in socks as she heard the ruling delivered at the House of Lords. The debilitating illness could not have been more alien to someone who even the year she was diagnosed was whitewater rafting and leaping from aeroplanes, and had delighted in her independence, living around the world and supporting herself with such confidence. But as she sped along the pavement in Westminster yesterday, captured on film by cameramen and baffled tourists alike, repeating the words &quot;we won!&quot;, it was clear she had been given a new lease of life. And as he put his hand over hers, Puente expressed his own relief. &quot;It gives her an opportunity to relax, to enjoy life more,&quot; he said. Then he leaned in and kissed her, and did not let go."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/01/afterlife-the-silence-room-reviewed", "sentences": ["Its output tends to be explicitly city related, and while The Silence Room cannot entirely be subtitled &quot;The Book of Newcastle&quot;, O&apos;Brien does muscular justice to this historic city, a gateway to other worlds: &quot;the bridges and the river that ran darkly beneath them, of the river&apos;s mouth and the vast satisfactory distances beyond, from here to either pole and on to Singapore and Valpara\u00edso&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2009-07-31T23:01:00Z", "title": "A volume of short stories and a first novel by Sean O'Brien | Book reviews", "tags": ["Sean O'Brien", "Fiction", "Crime fiction", "Culture", "Books"], "article": "Afterlife by Sean O&apos;Brien304pp, Picador, \u00a314.99Buy Afterlife at the Guardian bookshop The Silence Roomby Sean O&apos;Brien202pp, Comma Press, \u00a37.95Buy The Silence Room at the Guardian bookshop Sean O&apos;Brien has enjoyed a prolific career, mainly as a poet and critic. His poetry collection, The Drowned Book, won both the Forward and TS Eliot prizes. Last winter saw The Silence Room, a volume of short stories set mainly in an eerily drenched Newcastle upon Tyne, and now his first novel follows. Afterlife employs many of the gothic techniques of the stories, although the setting and climate are arrestingly different - the scorching summer of 1976, and a disrupted rural idyll starkly recollected some 30 years later. A quartet of postgraduates descends on the sleepy town of Divott in the Welsh Marches; two awkward couples, enmeshed in the &quot;tight, exhausting friendship of the young&quot;. Jane Jarmain and Alex Ferron are the stars of the group, fledgling poets intent on making names for themselves. Fretfully observing and narrating is Martin Stone, a contemporary of the pair at Cambridge. A passive, uncertain witness, he is envious of Alex&apos;s swaggering confidence, and equally in awe of Jane&apos;s fierce poetic gift, her concentration, and also of something elusive about her: &quot;her finely featured face and far-off green eyes combined delicacy with challenge.&quot;  Martin&apos;s own girlfriend is, naturally, Jane&apos;s polar opposite - solid, dependable Susie. &quot;She was the grown-up. She knew she must accept disappointment.&quot; Martin has managed to wangle a research grant to work on the papers of Thomas Exton, a fictional priest and metaphysical poet, whose archive is at Divott; the baking hot days are spent lolling about in the sun, or getting drunk and stoned in the nearest pub. Tensions between Jane, the actual poet, and Alex, the would-be one, escalate when Jane has a poem published in the TLS and wins a prestigious award and book contract. Enter the outsiders, both Americans - nervous Marcie, a visiting scholar entrusted with the Exton archive, and brash, sexy photographer Diane. An anarchic party hijacked by Hell&apos;s Angels and heavily spiked with acid sees the sabotage of Jane&apos;s manuscript and the break-up of hers and Alex&apos;s relationship; not long afterwards comes her suspicious death in a fire.  Three decades on and Martin, now professor at the local university, is overseeing Divott&apos;s annual poetry festival, and the interment of Jane&apos;s remains in the churchyard. In her afterlife Jane Jarmain has become a celebrated poet, whose reputation is carefully manipulated by her literary executor - none other than the estranged Alex. With Alex appearing at the festival, a showdown is inevitable - and it provides a grisly melodramatic ending which rather uncomfortably resembles the plot of Midsomer Murders. There is much that is tongue-in-cheek about the novel - as with the faux-formal style of several of his short stories, O&apos;Brien is playing with the reader - but there are too many inconsistencies. As a comic examination of literary feuding and posthumous ownership the tone is more petulant than mocking, and the characters do not appear fully formed; Alex and Martin preen their way from extended adolescence to middle-aged boorishness, while the women are either enigmatic catalysts or resigned, ministering acolytes. It&apos;s a fairly unreformed take, and one which doesn&apos;t allow much engagement with the story. There is no abiding sense of loss regarding Jane&apos;s death, for example - it simply facilitates the plot.  Meanwhile, for a book in which silence is the dominant theme, O&apos;Brien&apos;s short-story collection is inhabited by a panoply of hugely entertaining voices. As with The Drowned Book, the dark, brooding depths of the river Tyne form the backdrop to many an accidental death or suicide, while even the stories located elsewhere are suitably waterlogged. O&apos;Brien&apos;s ghostly antecedents are all literary - from Borges to Stevenson, LeFanu and both MR and Henry James. What his characters share is obsession, over obscure texts or unattainable objects of desire. And in keeping with gothic style, O&apos;Brien has fun with his women: slender, feline, boasting green eyes, blanched complexions, elliptical speech and sinuous names.  Horror lurks at the fringes of the everyday. In &quot;Not in Gateshead Any More&quot;, a promising young writer is held back by a controlling boyfriend, yet ultimately may have more to fear from the benign vampires who come to her rescue. &quot;The Cricket Match at Green Lock&quot; is a superbly chilling tale in which an amateur cricket team faces a spectral opposing side brought forth by an unseasonal storm. O&apos;Brien controls these pieces with highly elaborate, thrilling imagery, and while obviously indebted to those writers he pastiches so satisfyingly, his own poetic voice is evident.  The book&apos;s publisher, Comma Press, is a small but powerful champion of the short story, both British and European. Its output tends to be explicitly city related, and while The Silence Room cannot entirely be subtitled &quot;The Book of Newcastle&quot;, O&apos;Brien does muscular justice to this historic city, a gateway to other worlds: &quot;the bridges and the river that ran darkly beneath them, of the river&apos;s mouth and the vast satisfactory distances beyond, from here to either pole and on to Singapore and Valpara\u00edso&quot;.  This intense engagement with words, much in evidence in The Silence Room, is disappointingly infrequent in Afterlife. The burnished summer, while memorably described, seems remote from rather than intrinsic to the narrative. Fellow poet/novelist Lavinia Greenlaw has also written of the drought-laden heat of &apos;76 in her autobiographical novel Mary George of Allnorthover, a beautifully structured work of prose. It&apos;s a pity that O&apos;Brien&apos;s remarkable talent for language does not similarly colour his first sustained piece of fiction."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/aug/02/debbie-purdy-assisted-suicide-omari-puente", "sentences": ["One day while rehearsing in Singapore he was told that a music journalist called Debbie Purdy was to interview him."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-01T23:01:00Z", "title": "Interview: Debbie Purdy's husband, Cuban musician Omar Puente", "tags": ["Assisted dying", "Multiple sclerosis", "Relationships", "Health & wellbeing", "Society", "Life and style", "World news", "Cuba", "UK news", "Human rights", "House of Lords", "Politics", "Law", "Americas"], "article": "Omar Puente remembers stepping out of Heathrow airport for the first time. &quot;The ground was white and it was cold. It was like there was smoke coming out of my mouth when I spoke,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought, &apos;Ooooh dear, this is going to be tough.&apos; I had no friends, no family and no money, but I had come because of Debbie.&quot; That was 1997 and Puente - a Cuban violinist - was to stick by Debbie Purdy in every year that followed, her constant support in a long battle to force the British government to clarify the law on assisted suicide. Purdy, who has multiple sclerosis, wanted one thing: to know for certain that if her suffering became so bad that she chose to take her life at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, her husband would not be prosecuted for accompanying her. On Thursday the 46-year-old won a historic judgment from the House of Lords. Afterwards, as she sat in her wheelchair smiling gleefully and telling journalists she was &quot;ecstatic&quot;, Puente knelt by her side in a smart black shirt watching her proudly. &quot;I am happy because Debbie is happy,&quot; he said yesterday as he began eating breakfast at their Bradford home. He smiled at Purdy who was lying on the couple&apos;s double bed, placed downstairs when the house was converted to accommodate her wheelchair. She was so exhausted from her trip to London she said she might stay there for 48 hours. By her side, lying on the laminate floor, was one of her husband&apos;s four violins. Straight ahead French windows opened on to a small yard in which Purdy was growing strawberries and blueberries. &quot;We&apos;d call it a terrace if we were posh,&quot; she said, giggling like a child. Her husband laughed and said: &quot;She feels more in control, she feels that she has her life back, and I am happy because of that. She is a really strong woman and my mother was a really strong woman too.&quot; Puente was born in 1961 during the Cuban revolution. His father was a doctor and his mother a nurse. He began playing the violin at the age of eight and as a teenager moved to the capital to study at music school. &quot;My mother moved my entire family to Havana,&quot; said Puente, laughing. &quot;She said, &apos;My boy is going to Havana so everybody is going to Havana&apos;.&quot; Soon he was playing all over the world. One day while rehearsing in Singapore he was told that a music journalist called Debbie Purdy was to interview him. &quot;It was really tough to do the interview because my English was really, really, really, reaaaally bad,&quot; said Puente, stretching his words expressively and describing Purdy&apos;s white T-shirt and denim shorts. &quot;Her Spanish was zero and my English was 0.1.&quot; Somehow the couple hit it off and began dating. &quot;I learned the words &apos;beautiful&apos; and &apos;honey&apos; and &apos;pretty&apos; but I could not really pronounce &apos;gorgeous&apos;,&quot; said Puente, recalling their first days together. It was in the weeks that followed that Purdy realised something was wrong. She flew back to England and 15 days after her first doctor&apos;s appointment was diagnosed with MS. &quot;She called me in tears and I told her to get on a plane and come here,&quot; said Puente. For months she travelled with the band from Manila to Malaysia to Indonesia. Purdy said the band - and especially her boyfriend - never let her feel sorry for herself. Once when she lost control of her bowels, Puente burst out laughing. &quot;I said, &apos;How can you laugh?&apos; And he said, &apos;Either I&apos;ll cry with you or I&apos;ll laugh with you&apos;. What could I say? &quot;Terrible things happen to people all over the world - people have no water, food or education. MS isn&apos;t really so bad - and the fact that I can have a wheelchair, that is a good thing.&quot; Purdy had loved to dance but by then she could barely manage it. So Puente held her in his arms, with her feet balanced on his, and swung her around the dance floor.  The couple fell in love and when Purdy decided in 1997 that it was time to return home Puente went with her. Life in Yorkshire was a major culture shock. &quot;In Latin America you have a big family and you open the windows because it is hot. Here family is small and you close the windows because it is cold. You drive on the left and at the beginning I felt like people just kept saying, &apos;Please, please, thank-you, thank-you, please, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry&apos;,&quot; said Puente, mimicking British politeness. &quot;But whether it was coincidence, luck or destiny, I began learning a lot, I began playing in new ways and now England is my second home.&quot; Puente&apos;s experiences have been extraordinary. At first when he turned up at jazz venues musicians laughed that he had a violin - to them it was a classical instrument. But in time he joined in. Over the years he has played with famous musicians including John Williams, Robert Mitchell and Jools Holland, and been asked to jam with Ruben Gonzalez, the Cuban pianist who was a member of the Buena Vista Social Club. One day someone told Puente that Kirsty MacColl was to sing with his band and he replied &quot;Kirsty MacWho?&quot;. More was to come including collaborations with Courtney Pine, the jazz musician who has produced Puente&apos;s first album, &quot;From There to Here&quot;. It will be launched in November, and the pair will perform together in Scotland this week. He hopes his work will help pay off debts he built up flying to and from Cuba. In recent years Puente flew home every six weeks to visit his sick mother, who died last August at the age of 86. Talking about he possibility of one day assisting his wife in a suicide, he said: &quot;All Debbie wanted was a safety net. It is not as if she wants to go to Switzerland tomorrow. I don&apos;t want her to ever go, I want her to live hundreds and hundreds of years. And I would have accompanied her whatever happened. But we wanted clarity and at last, that is what we have.&quot; Two year battle July 2007: Solicitors Bindman&apos;s begin to gather evidence from people who have accompanied relatives to Dignitas. June 2008: There is a high court hearing of Purdy&apos;s case at the Royal Courts of Justice. Purdy wants to know what would happen to her husband if he accompanies her to Zurich. October 2008: Purdy&apos;s case is lost but the high court gives permission to take it to the court of appeal. February 2009: Court of appeal hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice. Three judges rule that Purdy is not entitled to the type of guidance she seeks. June 2009: House of Lords hears Purdy&apos;s case - its final sitting before making way for a supreme court. July 2009: The law lords rule in favour of Purdy. But Lord Hope of Craighead says it is not their function to change the law - simply to demand that it be clarified."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/aug/03/premier-league-title-contenders", "sentences": ["Dominic Fifield Liverpool Strength of team/squad It was hard to read too much into either game of Liverpool&apos;s Asian tour \u2013 Rafael Ben\u00edtez used 26 players against Thailand and 24 against Singapore.", "Liverpool&apos;s only major new recruit, Glen Johnson, showed signs of attacking nous but the right-back suffered an achilles injury against Thailand and missed the match in Singapore.", "Now fit, the 20-year-old displayed his finishing ability with two goals against Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-02T23:10:01Z", "title": "How the Premier League contenders have shaped up in pre-season", "tags": ["Premier League", "Arsenal", "Chelsea", "Liverpool", "Manchester City", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2009-10"], "article": "Arsenal Strength of team/squad Thomas Vermaelen, a left-footed centre-half signed from Ajax for \u00a310m, featured in the first four pre-season matches and looked composed, albeit against limited opposition. He has suffered a slight hamstring injury, however. Tomas Rosicky made a welcome return against Barnet, playing the first 45 minutes, and has featured at the Emirates Cup against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Rangers. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will consider the fit-again Rosicky almost as a new signing, together with Eduardo, who has got three pre-season goals to his name. The big setback has been Samir Nasri breaking a leg in training. He will be out for three months. Theo Walcott has not yet played after his England Under-21 exertions in June. Wenger remains under pressure to spend, having offloaded Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Emmanuel Adebayor.  Tactics Wenger has preferred a lone man in attack with two players in support \u2013 granted the licence to drift wide or inside \u2013 and a solid midfield three. Cesc F\u00e1bregas has been encouraged to break forward from his position within the trio. Against Hannover and Atl\u00e9tico, Robin van Persie was the focal point of the attack \u2013 he was preferred to Nicklas Bendtner, who played in one of the support roles. Andrey Arshavin, who has had an excellent pre-season, has floated from the left. One to watch Jack Wilshere The 17-year-old midfielder inspired Arsenal to win the FA Youth Cup last season and, having made eight first-team appearances, three of them as a starter in the Carling Cup, has been earmarked by Wenger for further progress. Small but tough, he fits easily into Arsenal&apos;s fluid attacking style and was man of the match in both the team&apos;s Emirates Cup games, scoring twice against Rangers yesterday. Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger After 13 seasons at the club, the job does not get any easier. An often beleaguered figure last term, he is desperate to make a more assured start this time but three of their first four league fixtures are away: Everton, Manchester United and Manchester City. There is also the small matter of the Champions League qualifying round to negotiate. Club&apos;s global appeal Chasing pre-season revenue or cracking the US or Asian markets has never\u00a0been to Wenger&apos;s taste and, as usual, he retreated to Austria with his squad for an intensive pre-season training camp and a sprinkling of friendlies. During their time away, the Gunners faced amateurs from the Austrian fourth division, Hungary&apos;s most unpronounceable team and Hannover. They stepped up their preparations at the Emirates Cup this past weekend and play Valencia\u00a0away next Saturday. David Hytner Chelsea Strength of team/squad Despite the lack of a marquee signing Chelsea&apos;s squad retains its depth and class, even with Joe Cole and Michael Ballack undergoing rehabilitation from injury. Daniel Sturridge and Ross Turnbull are useful additions, the latter a back-up goalkeeper, and Yuri Zhirkov \u2013 on the basis of his excellent debut against Milan \u2013 will offer balance, defensive surety and spring upfield, whether he is employed at full-back or, more likely, in midfield. Deco, for now, and Ricardo Carvalho remain at the club, with the centre-half eager to put last season&apos;s toils behind him.  Tactics Carlo Ancelotti intends to play a diamond in midfield, capped initially by Frank Lampard as the playmaker and with Mikel John Obi likely to be at its base. There will be a pair of strikers \u2013 gone, apparently, are the days of 4\u20133\u20133 with Didier Drogba barging forward with only wide men for company \u2013 with the full-backs asked to supply the team&apos;s natural width. Luiz Felipe Scolari tried something similar but never really struck a balance between rip-roaring attack and defensive industry. The Italian in Ancelotti will not put up with frailties if the full-backs are caught too often upfield and the channels left exposed. The team&apos;s play may prove far less direct than in recent seasons, with Ancelotti placing the onus on retaining possession in midfield, all neat triangles and overlaps, rather than seeking out Drogba&apos;s brawn and muscle through the middle.  One to watch Daniel Sturridge Manchester City may regret letting Daniel Sturridge slip away. The teenager actually stands more chance of making a mark at first-team level with Chelsea than he did at Eastlands given City&apos;s recent outlay on forwards. He impressed against Seattle Sounders with a debut goal and assist, unnerved Internazionale at times in California and should have added to his tally against the Mexicans. Manager Carlo Ancelotti Ancelotti&apos;s English is improving though it remains a work in progress. There appears to be a real determination about the Italian to expand his vocabulary and first impressions suggest he will not fall into the same trap as Scolari, whose English rather stagnated once competitive games came thick and fast. Club&apos;s global appeal The US appears to have taken to Chelsea. This was the Premier League club&apos;s fourth visit to the country in five years for pre-season and, at last, they have made their mark. Chelsea shirts littered the considerable crowds in Seattle, Pasadena, Baltimore and Arlington, where the team played. Attendances were magnificent. The club is making an impression in those parts. Dominic Fifield Liverpool Strength of team/squad It was hard to read too much into either game of Liverpool&apos;s Asian tour \u2013 Rafael Ben\u00edtez used 26 players against Thailand and 24 against Singapore. The late return of the Spanish contingent after the Confederations Cup limited them to cameo roles and Steven Gerrard missed the trip due to his court appearance. Liverpool&apos;s only major new recruit, Glen Johnson, showed signs of attacking nous but the right-back suffered an achilles injury against Thailand and missed the match in Singapore. The striker Andriy Voronin featured following a year on loan at Hertha Berlin but despite scoring, he failed to shine and does not look capable of easing the burden on Fernando Torres. Another option is desperately needed and with Martin Skrtel injured and Sami Hyypia gone, defensive cover is also vital. Lucas and Ryan Babel impressed, giving fans hope they are finally ready to repay the faith shown in them by the manager. The expected departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid will leave a major gap in midfield and Ben\u00edtez will need an adequate replacement.  Tactics Ben\u00edtez played with two up front in Asia but when the serious action begins he is unlikely to deviate from the system that worked so well last season, with Gerrard playing just behind a lone striker, Torres. The acquisition of Johnson highlights the manager&apos;s desire to play with attacking full-backs next season in a bid to avoid another string of frustrating home draws. One to watch Krisztian Nemeth The Hungarian striker was one of the stars of the reserves&apos; title triumph in 2007-08 but his progress last season was wrecked by injury. Now fit, the 20-year-old displayed his finishing ability with two goals against Singapore. Manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez The Spaniard is determined to kick on from last season&apos;s second-place finish, with the Premier League arguably the priority for most at Anfield. Ben\u00edtez grew increasingly frustrated in Asia at the constant questioning about Alonso&apos;s future but remained bullish about his club&apos;s title chances, saying the heat and humidity were ideal for knocking his players into shape. Club&apos;s global appeal Fears about the travelling were eased as the week-long tour proved a success both on and off the pitch. As well as playing two matches, they trained twice a day and packed in a host of public appearances. The players&apos; every move created a frenzy, emphasising the commercial opportunities for the club in this part of the world. The remarkable passion for Liverpool in Asia will have been greatly strengthened by the trip. David Rose Manchester City Strength of team/squad The frustration for Mark Hughes is that two of his six summer signings, Roque Santa Cruz and Carlos Tevez, have not had a minute of action in pre-season so far, but the manager is entitled to think that it has been an &quot;exceptional&quot; summer \u2013 the one downside being John Terry&apos;s apparent change of heart about leaving Chelsea and the inability, as yet, to sign Joleon Lescott from Everton. On the plus side, Gareth Barry has impressed on the club&apos;s three-match tour to South Africa and Hughes now has at least two accomplished players for every position in midfield and attack. Tactics Hughes favoured a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 system last season, occasionally switching to a more defence-minded 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 when the team were playing away from home against strong opposition. This season he has a far more talented squad and may alter his formation accordingly. The side now have a target man, meaning they should be better at holding up the ball in attacking positions. Expect to see experiments with 4\u20131\u20133\u20132 and also a more orthodox 4\u20134\u20132. One to watch Carlos Tevez &quot;Stupid&quot; is the word that one senior Manchester United official has used to describe the striker&apos;s defection to a club that are not even involved in the Europa League. Tevez certainly has a point to prove and his other role, as a symbol of City&apos;s ambition, seems to have increased since the provocative Welcome to Manchester billboard that led Sir Alex Ferguson to describe City as being guilty of &quot;arrogance&quot; and being a &quot;small club with a small mentality&quot;. Manager Mark Hughes Hughes has been bristling with confidence on the back of the summer spending as well as the departure of so many unneeded squad players. The word at City now is that the atmosphere in training is as good as it has ever been under the current management. Hughes has handled Ferguson&apos;s criticisms impeccably and he has also broken up the Brazilian quartet that was considered too cliquish by the club&apos;s management, with Jo joining Everton on a season&apos;s loan and Elano going to the Turkish club Galatasaray. Club&apos;s global appeal The tournament in South Africa was not the most prestigious event and there was none of the hysteria that accompanies United&apos;s visits to south-east Asia, for example. But City are clearly proving to be a draw these days. The club still have to play Rangers at Ibrox, as well as hosting Celtic, and they have also been invited to play Barcelona at Camp Nou on their first blank Wednesday of the new season. Daniel Taylor Manchester United Strength of team/squad Without Cristiano Ronaldo, United occasionally lacked a bit of star quality on a tour to the Far East and Germany, particularly when the standard rose in the Audi Cup in Munich. The mantra is that United will be &quot;difficult to beat&quot; and they retain a formidable first-choice defence, not least in the centre, with Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. Michael Owen showed with four goals in four games on the Asian tour that he is less of\u00a0a gamble than some imagine and the most expensive summer signing, Antonio Valencia, made a positive impression with a goal on his debut, against Boca Juniors. Covering the loss\u00a0of Ronaldo&apos;s goals and assists will\u00a0be key. Tactics The Ronaldo years came to be dominated by a 4-3-3 formation but on tour United reverted to 4-4-2. Ferguson was adamant that this season Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney would be used as out and out centre-forwards, although he said this about Rooney a year ago. Interestingly, given how they were once a fixture for England, Rooney and Owen did not play together in any of United&apos;s six games. One to watch Ben Foster Twenty-six is rather late to be breaking through, but Foster has done a lot of waiting. Ferguson seems convinced by his quality and has said he is &quot;miles ahead&quot; of any other English goalkeeper. However, if Foster is the best keeper in England, then Edwin van der Sar remains one of the best in the world. Granting Foster games in the Carling Cup is one thing, playing him in the closing weeks of a season quite another. Manager Sir Alex Ferguson Ferguson has joined Geoffrey Boycott, Tony Benn and Alan Bennett as a national treasure. He travelled around the Far East and Germany saying exactly what he thought of Real Madrid, Manchester City and Rafael Ben\u00edtez. If some people found this unsettling, then it should be remembered that Ferguson is usually right. This time last year in South Africa, Ferguson highlighted Chelsea&apos;s ageing squad. That seemed ridiculous when they raced into an early lead, but not when they collapsed in mid-season. Club&apos;s global appeal Despite the loss of Ronaldo, United&apos;s greatest marketing vehicle since David Beckham, the club&apos;s appeal shows no sign of slowing. Had the bombing of the team hotel in Jakarta not forced the cancellation of their trip to Indonesia, United would have played in front of more than 400,000 people. As it was, they managed to sell 30,000 tickets in Kuala Lumpur in two days and Rooney duly replaced Ronaldo as the most sought-after player.

Or so it seemed. For he informed me, in all solemnity, that he was working on a time machine in his garden shed. He would update me on its progress, which was clearly not great as his continued daily presence at work attested. Far fetched as his ambition was, one could at least sympathise with the modesty of his aims once he finally located the sprocket from the dismantled lawnmower that would get the machine going. He had no intention of going back to 1919 in Versailles and trying to amend the Treaty so as to avoid the second world war, or assassinating Margaret Thatcher, or doing anything that might disturb the delicate socio-historical continuum. He merely wished to go back to early 1973 and place a large, combined bet on Red Rum to win the Grand National and Sunderland to win the FA Cup, and, having taken advantage of the long odds, convert his winnings into gold bullion before returning smartly back home. Nice work. Despite its preoccupation over the decades with time travel, this is the sort of story Hollywood rarely tells. Instead, we get the likes of the new film The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife, in which Eric Bana plays a librarian who finds himself abruptly jumping back and forth through the decades (though never, it seems, carrying a razor blade on his journeys), meeting his future spouse when she is just a child. Lovely for her, except that he does have a habit of literally disappearing into thin air during the marriage, unable as he is to control the when and where of the time-travelling process. He at least pretends to be pained by this, though some husbands might wistfully reflect that he is enacting an ultimate male fantasy. But he&apos;s always far too spiritual and romantically unshaven ever to contemplate placing a sporting wager when visiting the past, it seems, let alone using the phrase &quot;Honey, I got spirited away, you know how it is&quot; as an excuse for a long trip down to the dog track. Time travel in the movies tends to combine a certain high-mindedness with a magnificently deaf ear to the howls of sceptical queries it begs. For example, in Superman, when Christopher Reeve goes red in the face and reverses the spinning of the planet, would that really turn back time as intended and enable him to save the life of Lois Lane? Or would it not rather send the contents and inhabitants of the planet hurtling with comedic abruptness into deep space? Similarly, in The Time Machine (1960), how does Rod Taylor create an accurate gauge in order to measure the time he&apos;s travelled before he&apos;s actually travelled through it? The Time Machine is, for all its risible flaws, the daddy of time-travel movies. It&apos;s preceded by A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&apos;s Court in 1949, in which Bing Crosby plays an American in Camelot. He does so, however, with typically infernal, pipesmoking complacency, as if ambling round an Olde English-themed crazy golf course, taking in his stride such preposterous temporal coincidences as a full eclipse taking place in the moment of his impending execution. Rod Taylor was never the sort who would win any National Gurning Contests, but in The Time Machine he&apos;s at least sufficiently expressive to partially raise a slightly intrigued eyebrow as he hurtles 800,000 years into the future. Moreover, his mode of travel sets a standard of baroque elegance subsequently unmatched in time-travel cinema. No vulgar telephone kiosk (Bill &amp; Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure) or CGI zapping (The Terminator) or even giant, malevolent bunny rabbits (Donnie Darko) for him. The Wellsian machine&apos;s many extraneous features include red leather upholstery, a patterned umbrella and what looks like a faux-Oriental lampshade attached to the side. None of which help dilate time but at least throw the vulgarity of the troglodyte Morlocks into greater relief. Ah, time dilation. Derived from Einstein&apos;s theory of relativity, it&apos;s offered as the explanation in Planet Of The Apes (1968) for the disparity between the time it takes to travel through time and the length of time traversed. Hence Charlton Heston and his crew only age 18 months despite having made a 2,006-year long journey. But once your head starts spinning at these concepts it throws up all sorts of other questions. Like, if Heston&apos;s crew had not put on the brakes and overshot by an aeon, would they have arrived on a planet where the horses, on which the apes first ride in, had themselves overthrown their simian masters? Did no one consider this? Planet Of The Horses? But then, when climbing aboard the time machine, the first question is whether to push the lever into forward thrust or reverse into the past. On balance, the past is surer ground, as the enormous success of Back To The Future, mostly a Happy Days-style nostalgia-fest, indicates. Travel into the future is invidious as The Time Machine again shows, with its scenarios of silver foiled citizens fleeing a nuclear catastrophe in the year 1966. Such are the problems that arise when time travel involves the near future, only for real time to plod along, like the hare, and eventually supersede these fantasies. It&apos;s what you might call the Space: 1999 syndrome, or the &quot;How many copies of Orwell&apos;s 1984 were sold in 1985?&quot; question. So, in Terminator, the apocalyptic activation of Skynet occurs in 1997, which doubtless seemed a far-off time at one point, while 1992&apos;s Freejack, starring Mick Jagger, is set in a future in which bodies can be stolen from the past to replace presently defective carcasses. When in the future? In the year 2009. Scary. Then there is the sort of circularity thrown up, for example, in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, in which the crew go back to the year 1986. In one scene, in some dazzling computer work, Scotty reveals to an 80s manufacturer the futuristic formula for &quot;transparent aluminium&quot;. Hence its invention. One could develop a serious dope habit trying to get one&apos;s head around that one. It&apos;s like John Logie Baird only inventing the television because a visitor from the future had shown him the fruits of his own ingenuity. Some films have bravely attempted to address such conundra, notably the ultra-low budget Primer (2004), a film which includes such boggling lines as, &quot;I haven&apos;t eaten since later this afternoon&quot;, in which the protagonists know they have succeeded in their quest to travel in time because they catch sight of their own &quot;doubles&quot;. But then, if matter can neither be created or destroyed, where did the material come from to make these &quot;doubles&quot;? Ultimately, Bill &amp; Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure and Terry Gilliam&apos;s Time Bandits probably have the right idea. Don&apos;t agonise, restrict the science to flashes of smoke and have a jolly romp down the centuries looking in on Abe Lincoln, Genghis Khan, Robin Hood, Beethoven, and, especially, Napoleon, the most-bothered of historical figures by Hollywood time travellers. Or you could do a Back To The Future and, like Michael J Fox, show off a bit; in his case, going into a full-on guitar wig-out in front of a 1950s crowd, exposing the bobbysox weediness of their own un-evolved music. Hey, suppose Kasabian got hold of a time machine? They could go back 40 years and show Hendrix and Led Zeppelin a thing or two. Time travel methods HG Wells&apos;s time machine The most splendid vehicle of all, though it&apos;s a bugger to drag around. As suitable for lounging around in, ingesting opium and reading Edgar Allan Poe as for voyaging through the centuries. The phone booth Favoured by both Doctor Who and George Carlin&apos;s Rufus in Bill &amp; Ted&apos;s Excellent Adventure, the phone booth was all well and commonplace in days of futures past but nowadays they can only be located in museums or the back gardens of faux-English cottages in Singapore. The DeLorean car As seen in Back To The Future, it&apos;s the perfect means of transportation: it could disappear anywhere it wanted in the future, having no actual future of its own. Renegade dwarves As in the antiheroes of Time Bandits, who took advantage of their insider knowledge that Creation had been a rush job. Being little chaps helped them slip through the holes in the space-time continuum, too. \u2022 The Time Traveler&apos;s Wife is out Fri"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/12/burma-suu-kyi-un-eu", "sentences": ["They bank much of it in Singapore, if the US treasury department is to be believed, and as long as their borders are secure, and their neighbours in China, India and Thailand remain loyal, they have about 90% of what they need from life."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-11T23:05:10Z", "title": "Burma: Land of darkness", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "Oil and gas companies", "World news", "Business", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "The door was open to the Burmese military junta. If they had released the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and some of the 2,100 other political prisoners, they could have begun to end the international isolation in which they have plunged the country for the past four decades. But they slammed that door shut yesterday. By making sure that Ms Suu Kyi will spend the next year and a half under house arrest, the generals have ensured that she cannot participate in next year&apos;s election. She is already banned from holding high office, under one article in the constitution specifically written for her, which says that no one who has been married to a foreign citizen can be president. And neither can she be elected to parliament, under another article banning past offenders from office. But such is the power of her political genie, and the fear of what would happen if it were let out of the bottle, that the cork is triple-fastened. General Than Shwe, Burma&apos;s ruler, is at least consistent in his repression. If a cyclone which killed more than 140,000 of his people could not deflect him from holding a referendum on a pet project to put a civilian facade on military rule, then the uproar yesterday over Ms Suu Kyi&apos;s sentence would be unlikely to deflect him from his purpose. The United Nations, the EU, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, all demanded Ms Suu Kyi&apos;s unconditional release, and Gordon Brown&apos;s statement showed signs of personal outrage. He said her prosecution was monstrous and that the will of the UN security council had been flouted, and called for an arms embargo. But little of this matters to Burma&apos;s rulers. They care not one jot for their people, to whose poverty and suffering they are impervious. They have mansions, Mercedes, and unlimited supplies of cash from oil, gas and teak timber revenues. They bank much of it in Singapore, if the US treasury department is to be believed, and as long as their borders are secure, and their neighbours in China, India and Thailand remain loyal, they have about 90% of what they need from life. And it was of their neighbours and the Association of South East Asian Nations that Than Shwe was thinking when he reduced the sentence of his most important political prisoner from three years&apos; hard labour to 18 months of house arrest, by saying he was acting out of reverence for her father, a hero of Burma&apos;s independence from the British. Than Shwe was not thinking of anyone else. The leitmotif of Barack Obama&apos;s presidency \u2013 that engagement with the international community could provide an incentive to change \u2013 is, sadly, profoundly misplaced in Burma&apos;s case. It shows no signs of going down the path Vietnam once trod. Realising that the options with Burma&apos;s brutal leaders are limited does not mean throwing our hands up in despair. The international aid effort in the Irrawaddy delta has worked better than anyone had expected in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis, in terms of both access and freedom of movement. Access is maintained at the cost of staying silent over human rights abuses, but it is nonetheless clear that efforts to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the Burmese people should be stepped up. So, too, should diplomatic pressure from the United Nations be maintained. General sanctions have failed, but targeted ones against their leaders and their funds abroad could be more effective. Far more could be done to highlight the work done by multinationals in aiding the regime. The oil company Total, along with a subsidiary of Chevron, has been involved in the Yadana gas pipeline in the Andaman Sea, which pumps Burmese gas to Thailand. Its chief executive, Christophe de Margerie, told Newsweek that critics of the company&apos;s operations in Burma could &quot;go to hell&quot;. If Burma&apos;s rulers are immune to pressure, Mr de Margerie has shown that he, for one, is\u00a0not."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-lawyers", "sentences": ["China called on other countries to &quot;fully respect [Burma&apos;s] judicial sovereignty&quot;, while Singapore \u2013 a key economic partner \u2013 described the verdict only as &quot;disappointing&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-12T09:33:31Z", "title": "Lawyers to appeal against Aung San Suu Kyi sentence", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "United Nations", "European Union", "World news", "Gordon Brown", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "Lawyers for Aung San Suu Kyi said they would appeal against the 18-month sentence imposed for breaking the terms of her house arrest as world leaders stepped up criticism of the Burmese regime.

After being driven home in a six-car convoy last night, Aung San Suu Kyi found a barbed wire fence had been erected near the entrance to her home while she was standing trial. A member of her National League for Democracy (NLD) had tied yellow ribbons to her front gate and nearby trees. The US president, Barack Obama, joined other world leaders in calling for her immediate release. Obama said the court&apos;s &quot;unjust decision reminds us of the thousands of other political prisoners in Burma who, like Aung San Suu Kyi, have been denied their liberty because of their pursuit of a government that respects the will, rights and aspirations of all Burmese citizens. &quot;They, too, should be freed. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.&quot; The condemnation was not universal, however. China called on other countries to &quot;fully respect [Burma&apos;s] judicial sovereignty&quot;, while Singapore \u2013 a key economic partner \u2013 described the verdict only as &quot;disappointing&quot;. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations went further, expressing &quot;deep disappointment&quot; in a statement issued by its current chair, Thailand. The UN security council was unable to agree on a statement condemning the court ruling, with Chinese and Russian delegates saying they needed more time to consider the wording. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said he &quot;strongly deplores&quot; the verdict, urging Burma&apos;s leaders &quot;to immediately and unconditionally release&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi. The European Union said it would increase sanctions, while 14 Nobel laureates including the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu called on the security council to take tougher action against the military regime. Gordon Brown said he was &quot;saddened and angry&quot; at the conviction. The British prime minister called the sentence &quot;further proof that the military regime in Burma is determined to act with total disregard for accepted standards of the rule of law and in defiance of international opinion&quot;. &quot;This is a purely political sentence designed to prevent her from taking part in the regime&apos;s planned elections next year.&quot; Lawyers for Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s co-defendant, John Yettaw, said they would appeal against his seven-year prison sentence, which includes four years&apos; hard labour, for violating the terms of the pro-democracy leader&apos;s house arrest and two other offences. It was unclear whether Yettaw, who triggered the case after swimming a lake to her hous and spending two days uninvited there in early May, spent last night in his cell or a prison hospital. The 53-year-old, who has diabetes and a heart condition, was recently treated in hospital for epileptic seizures. &quot;I will do my utmost to get my client deported as quickly as possible, especially because of his health condition,&quot; said his lawyer, Khin Maung Oo. Yettaw \u2013 described as an eccentric by his family \u2013 said he had visited Aung San Suu Kyi to warn her she was about to be assassinated by terrorists. She pleaded with him to leave but relented after he said he was too weak to swim back across the lake. Opponents of the Burmese junta, which has ruled since 1962, said Yettaw&apos;s stunt had been exploited to keep Aung San Suu Kyi out of the public eye during multi-party elections. As the leader of the NLD, she represents the most serious threat to the generals&apos; hold on power. The opposition party won an overwhelming victory in the last elections in 1990 but the junta refused to accept the result.

Therefore, it is a double tragedy that Yasmin Ahmad, one of the few Malaysian directors to make a name on the world stage, has died aged 51 after suffering a stroke and undergoing surgery for a cerebral haemorrhage. Ahmad was part of a new generation of film-makers who reflected the wide ethnic and cultural diversity of her country and the lives and dreams of its young people. Stylistically, her principal influences were Yasujiro Ozu and Douglas Sirk, although she created her own western and oriental mixture. Her films challenged ethnic stereotypes, and she was openly against any type of fundamentalism and racism, making it her life&apos;s work to support minority rights. Unsurprisingly, her feature films were disliked by the regime in Malaysia, a conservative, mostly Muslim country, for tackling taboo subjects such as inter-racial relations and teenage angst. In fact, the second, and perhaps most renowned of her six features, Sepet (2004), was banned in Malaysia, until Ahmad agreed to make eight cuts. Sepet (which could be translated as &quot;slit eyes&quot;), about a relationship between a Chinese boy and a Malay girl, touched the sensitive nerve of race in Malaysia, where the memory of the terrible 1969 riots between Chinese and Malays is still strong. Ahmad, who was married to a Chinese man, made the film for $400,000 and shot it in Ipoh, where Chinese and Malay communities live in close proximity. The film focused on a 16-year-old student, Orked (Sharifah Amani), the only child of well-off Malay parents (amusingly played by Ida Nerina and Harith Iskander), who falls for Jason (Ng Choo Seong), a slightly older Chinese boy, an aspiring poet who sells pirated video tapes at an open-air market. Despite differences in class, race and language (they communicate in English), a romance blossoms. This is often wryly observed, though it ends in tragedy. Ahmad followed the characters of Orked and her family in two sequels, Gubra and Mukhsin (both 2006). Ahmad was born in Kampung Bukit Treh in Muar, Johor, the oldest of three children of a musician father and theatre director mother. She was educated in England and gained a degree in arts and psychology at Newcastle University. Film was far from her mind when she got a job at IBM as a marketing representative, before moving into advertising as a copywriter at Ogilvy &amp; Mather. In 1993, she joined the advertising agency Leo Burnett in Kuala Lumpur, where she became an influential executive creative director and for whom she made ads for Petronas, the national oil and gas company. This led to her first feature, Rabun, in 2002. (All her films have one-word titles.) It first introduced the character of Orked, clearly the director&apos;s surrogate, in a supporting role as the daughter of elderly parents who travel from the city to a village, where life is perceived to be easier. Ahmad&apos;s treatment of the love, both physical and spiritual, between the couple, is remarkable, while the use of long takes and voice-overs, and the avoidance of close-ups, allowed audiences more objectivity than the usual &quot;in your face&quot; approach of much of mainstream Asian cinema. Gubra (&quot;Anxiety&quot;) takes place some years after Sepet left off, and continues the theme of race/class problems as Orked, now a jet-setting married professional, has a romantic liaison with the brother of her late Chinese boyfriend. This story runs parallel to one set in a slum where a devout Muslim couple befriend two prostitutes. While expertly balancing comedy and melodrama, Ahmad makes pointed social observations, and stresses the need for forgiveness and compassion. Mukhsin, another semi-autobiographical film in the Orked series, goes back to the late 60s when the heroine, a tomboy aged 10, befriends a 12-year-old boy (the title character) while on vacation at a kampung (village settlement). Probably Ahmad&apos;s most appealing film, it develops the theme of the benefits of a close-knit family and observes the ironies of first love with warmth and humour. Muallaf (The Convert, 2008), about religious conversion, was not shown in Malaysia, despite being approved by the censors with three audio mutings. It tells of two devoutly Muslim Malay sisters on the run from their wealthy, abusive father. They meet a Chinese Catholic school teacher, who draws comfort from their religion. Despite the subject matter, Ahmad said Muallaf is actually about forgiving one&apos;s parents for all the wrong they may have done. But solemnity and didacticism was never Ahmad&apos;s way, and she retained a lightness of touch. In her final completed film, Talentime (2009), Ahmad revisited the themes of faith, tolerance, family and living in a multicultural society.

By contrast, Britain remains mired in the downturn, although it too is expected to come out of recession soon. In the United States, the latest comments from the Federal Reserve have been markedly more optimistic and unemployment recorded a surprise dip last week, suggesting the world&apos;s largest economy may have turned the corner. UK \u2013 in recession Britain&apos;s economy is in worse shape than much of the rest of western Europe, having shrunk by 0.8% in the second quarter. It too is forecast to emerge from recession soon, but recovery could be &quot;slow and protracted&quot;, Bank of England governor Mervyn King warned yesterday, as he attacked the big banks for their role in tipping the world into recession. United States \u2013 in recession The Federal Reserve was more optimistic when it said last night the economy appeared to be &quot;levelling out&quot; \u2013 a considerable upgrade from its last meeting in June, when the central bank observed only that the economy&apos;s contraction was slowing. The comments came after a surprise dip in the US unemployment rate last week. The world&apos;s largest economy contracted by an annual rate of 1% in the second quarter, a marked improvement on the previous three months when the economy slumped by 6.4%, the biggest decline since 1982. Germany \u2013 out of recession Europe&apos;s largest economy has climbed out of recession earlier than predicted. A 0.3% rise in gross domestic product in the second quarter ended four quarters of contraction - Germany&apos;s deepest recession since the second world war. France \u2013 out of recession  France has surprised economists by returning to growth of 0.3% in the second quarter, ending four quarters of contraction. Italy \u2013 in recession  Italy reported a 0.5% decline in second-quarter GDP last week, better than the 2.7% fall recorded in the first quarter, but remains in recession. Spain  Second-quarter figures for Spain are not available yet, although ING reckons it continued to shrink after a 1.9% decline in the first three months of the year. Ireland  Ireland has not released data for the second quarter yet. It shrank by 1.5% in the first quarter and by 5.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. Portugal \u2013 out of recession  Portugal joined Germany and France when it came out of recession today with a 0.3% rise in second-quarter GDP. Greece \u2013 dodged recession  Greece had only one quarter of contraction - down 1.2% in the first quarter - thus avoiding recession. It grew by 0.3% in the second quarter. Sweden \u2013 out of recession  Sweden recorded zero growth in the second quarter, ending a string of declines. Austria \u2013 in recession  Austria&apos;s economy shrank by 0.4% between April and June, an improvement on the 2.7% slump recorded in the first quarter. Belgium \u2013 in recession  Belgium also contracted by 0.4%, compared with a 1.7% decline in the first three months of the year. Netherlands \u2013 in recession The Netherlands fared worse than the UK in the second quarter, with a 0.9% slump in GDP, although that was better than the first quarter&apos;s 2.7% slump. Slovakia \u2013 stayed out of recession The East European country returned to growth of 2.2% between April and June, compared with an 11% slump in the first quarter. It has managed to stay out of recession in recent quarters. Japan \u2013 still in recession Japan&apos;s economy, the world&apos;s second largest, is expected to have pulled out of its deepest post-war recession, with economists pencilling in growth of 1% for the second quarter. This would mark the first expansion in five quarters. China \u2013 growing faster than before China&apos;s economic growth accelerated in the second quarter as a massive stimulus package kicked in, triggering hopes that it could drive the rest of the world towards recovery. Annual GDP growth in the world&apos;s third largest economy picked up to 7.9% from 6.1% in the first quarter. It is on course to achieve its growth target of 8% for the year. India \u2013 still growing India is on track for growth of about 8% this year, making it one of the best performing economies in the world, although its rate of growth has slowed in recent quarters. Australia \u2013 stayed out of recession Australia has dodged recession so far, with a 0.4% rise in first-quarter GDP. Singapore \u2013 out of recession Singapore leapt out of recession in the second quarter with a 20.7% jump in gross domestic product. Thailand  Thailand&apos;s economy slipped into its first recession in a decade in the first quarter. A government official has estimated that GDP fell by 5%-6% in the second quarter, compared with a 7.1% slump in the first. Brazil \u2013 still in recession Latest economic indicators point to positive growth in Brazil, Latin America&apos;s largest economy, in the second quarter and to around zero growth over the year as a whole.

The Daily Telegraph reported today that the consortium has approached bankers from Credit Suisse to prepare a bid for British Land that could be worth up to \u00a310bn including debt. Investors from Abu Dhabi and a group of Indian families were initially only interested in buying Broadgate Circle, British Land&apos;s flagship development in the City. But now the group is considering bidding for the whole company, the Telegraph said. It quoted sources as saying that the consortium had not approached British Land yet and could also look at other targets. The bid talk benefited commercial property group Hammerson, the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 this morning. Its shares climbed 30.1p to 427.4p, a gain of 7.6%. Rival property developer Land Securities also rose, trading 5.6% higher at 661.5p, up 35p. The consortium is thought to include Mittal, Britain&apos;s richest man, alongside at least two other Indian families and the Abu Dhabi ruling family, whose British investments include Barclays and Manchester City football club. British Land, which reports first-quarter results next week, already has the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation as its largest shareholder, with a 4.9% stake.

A story about a guy who bought his wife a small ruby with what otherwise would have been his union dues. That&apos;s what&apos;s in the Daily News!&quot;  Apologies for coming over all Guys and Dolls, but elsewhere in the daily news, football writer Paul Doyle but down his quill for long enough to give his thoughts on the forthcoming Premier League season to Jon Dennis, host of the Guardian Daily podcast.

Meanwhile on the wires, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez is hopeful that centre-backs Jamie Carragher and Martin Skrtel will be fit to face Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday, but Wolves manager Mick McCarthy will be without Scottish defender Christophe Berra for his side&apos;s season-opener against West Ham tomorrow afternoon.

The improved new deal includes a one-year extension option that could keep the Spaniard at Anfield until 2014.

(BG)  12.10pm: This just in: three players from Brunei DPMM, who play in Singapore&apos;s S-League, have been given lengthy bans following an attack on a referee earlier this month.  Croatian defender Rene Komar has been hit with a 15-month ban after admitting punching referee K.Kalimuthu in a match against Home United on 2 August. Sallehuddin admitted confronting Kalimuthu &quot;in an aggressive and threatening manner&quot; and also shoving the match official and has been sidelined for 12 months.  Right-back Yusof Salleh also confessed to confronting and mishandling the referee, for which he got a six-month ban.

David Moyes has meanwhile had a pop at Mark Hughes for &apos;twisting&apos; Joleon Lescott&apos;s head (which sounds like it could be quite painful).

Here&apos;s an extract from the statement on Norwich&apos;s site:   &quot;After a productive summer, which saw an unbeaten programme of friendlies and 12 new players brought in, City slumped to a 7-1 defeat to Colchester in their League One curtain-raiser at Carrow Road on 8 August. Despite Tuesday night&apos;s 4-0 Carling Cup win at Yeovil, the Board felt a change of leadership and direction for the first team squad was essential to maximise the Club&apos;s chances of achieving promotion back to the Championship.&quot;   5.15pm Time to say goodbye here, then, and we&apos;ll sign off with the news that Mark Schwarzer has signed a one-year contract extension with Fulham. If you&apos;re not headed for the battlecruiser, why not follow Ravi Bopara&apos;s quest for runs at Lord&apos;s (where Alastair Cook has already made a quick-fire 60). And if you like that sort of thing, you&apos;ll certainly enjoy a wee discussion about what England&apos;s batting line-up at The Oval should be.

After largely keeping out of the internal US debate, British political figures responded to the torrent of criticism the NHS has faced in the US by appealing directly to American voters and urging them to recognise its merits. Labour also sought to embarrass David Cameron by challenging him to disown the comments made by the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, a known critic of the NHS, who this week appeared on American television saying that he &quot;would not wish it on anybody&quot; and that the cost of maintaining it had brought Britain close to Zimbabwean-style collapse. Cameron said that Hannan was an &quot;eccentric&quot; who did not represent the views of the Conservative party on health. But Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, John Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, and Andy Burnham, the health secretary, all took to the airwaves to argue that Hannan&apos;s words exposed the shallowness of the Conservatives&apos; commitment to the NHS. Cameron faced further embarrassment on Friday when one of Hannan&apos;s Conservative colleagues in the European parliament expressed support for his position. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4&apos;s PM programme, Roger Helmer insisted: &quot;Now we all love the NHS, but I think we all know in our hearts that it is no longer the envy of the world.&quot; He went on: &quot;If the Americans came to me and said would you recommend us taking up a system just like the British NHS? I think I would have to say &apos;No&apos;.&quot; Governments are normally reluctant to get involved in other countries&apos; internal debates. But todaythe Department of Health confirmed that it was trying to influence the media debate in the US, where Republicans opposed to Obama&apos;s plans to extend health insurance have cited horror stories about the NHS as evidence of the dangers of socialised healthcare. Gordon Brown and several ministers have already joined a Twitter campaign defending the NHS. The DoH is circulating a fact sheet prepared for Americans and Lord Darzi, the surgeon who served as a health minister, is giving interviews with American television to defend the NHS. Unison, the public service union, said it was sending literature to its sister unions in the US to counter the &quot;gross lies and distortions&quot;. Prescott recorded a message on YouTube telling American voters about the history of the NHS. Aiming his message as much at a UK audience, Prescott focused on Hannan, who wants the NHS to be replaced with a Singapore-style system that would involve patients having individual health accounts. This week Hannan told American TV: &quot;The healthcare system we have is kind of a relic of an era in Britain when the state was considered all-powerful and benign and when we had rationing and when we had ID cards and when we had mass nationalisation. And we&apos;re still stuck with it because, once you get a system like that, it&apos;s almost impossible to get rid of. How amazing to me that a free people, you know, citizens of a country founded on the principle of independence, independence for the citizen as well as independence for the state, should be contemplating, in peacetime, burdening themselves with a system like this, which puts the power of life and death in a state bureaucracy.&quot; Asked about Hannan&apos;s comments, the Conservative leader said the MEP had &quot;some quite eccentric views about some things&quot; and that &quot;political parties always include some people who don&apos;t toe the party line on one issue or another issue&quot;. Cameron insisted his party supported the NHS strongly. &quot;We are the party of the NHS, we back it, we are going to expand it, we have ringfenced it and said that it will get more money under a Conservative government, and it is our number one mission to improve it,&quot; he said. Hannan was on holiday in France today and declined to respond. But Mandelson said British voters would be shocked to see a Conservative politician going to America to &quot;slag off&quot; the NHS. &quot;What we see is the two faces of the Conservative party \u2013 the one David Cameron wants everyone to see and believe, and the other one presented by the Conservative parliamentarian,&quot; he said. Senior figures in British healthcare are frustrated at the portrayal of the NHS. Mike Hobday, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: &quot;We are really furious at the way in which the NHS, which is the best healthcare system around, is being denigrated by a group of people who clearly don&apos;t have the first idea about how it works.&quot; In its briefing document for the American press, the DoH points out that people with many of the most common diseases die earlier or in greater numbers in the US than in England. America fares badly in a direct comparison of key health performance indicators. &quot;We&apos;ve done this to clarify things and in order not to allow misconceptions about the NHS to go unchallenged,&quot; said one source. World Health Organisation data shows that life expectancy in England \u2013 78 \u2013 is a year longer than in the US and that nine babies out of every 1,000 born die before they reach five in America, compared with six in England, the DoH dossier says.

We should so get one of those,&quot; said one of the girls to a street hawker. &quot;How much for that hat? What about that flag?&quot; asked another. After I&apos;d finished at the ATM, one of the girls came over and asked, &quot;Can you give me a ride on your motorbike? I left my wallet at the hotel.&quot; &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, smiling. I&apos;d been working and travelling in East Timor for close to a year. When I first arrived, I saw very few backpackers, but increasingly, the more adventurous of the gap-year market have been making East Timor a stop-off on their tours of south-east Asia.  The British Foreign Office - and its Australian equivalent - may currently warn against all but essential travel there (so travel insurance may be invalidated) but that hasn&apos;t stopped hardcore explorers putting this beautiful country on their gap-year itineraries. All that matters to them is discovering the footprint-free beach, the place that&apos;s just like Thailand before the guidebooks.  East Timor ticks all the boxes for the extreme traveller, and earns maximum bragging points for those travellers&apos; tales exchanges. There is barely any tourism. No luxury hotels, golf courses or malls - not even the travellers&apos; huts and hippy markets elsewhere on the backpacker circuit. Yet those few adventurous souls who come here will find a very special place - empty beaches, spectacular diving, sleepy fishing villages, mountains like Nepal&apos;s, wooden-hut villages, forests and monstrous rock formations. Most backpackers start at the Dili Backpackers hostel, which has served an ever-growing trickle of travellers since 2002. There I met Iain Purdie, a 35-year-old Geordie who was staying for a week. &quot;It&apos;s a beautiful place,&quot; he told me, describing the highlights of his trip: motorbiking round the Baucau district east of Dili, where he slapped high fives with local kids as he whizzed past; climbing up roads with gorgeous views of unspoilt beaches and coral-filled waters.  Dili was just the beginning - a gateway to near-virgin territory full of adventure and exotic cultural traditions. Within a couple of months in East Timor, I&apos;d explored limestone caves in Viqueque and swum in hot springs in Venilale; watched the sun rise at the beach on Atauro Island where I&apos;d been the only guest at an eco-lodge; and huddled around a ring in Dili to catch my first cockfight. The lack of tourists means locals are often overwhelming friendly. Cycling round Dili I met a local family who invited me away with them to a village called Manetu in Ainaro, a hilly district about 50 miles south of the capital.  They didn&apos;t speak much English - Tetum, the local language, or one of its dialects, is the norm - but we had a mutual enjoyment of cigarettes, food and alcohol. I had no idea what to expect or even where I was going, but we jumped in the back of a pick-up truck - me, two families, a buffalo and a pig - for a long and bumpy journey through the countryside. Later that night I was sitting in a hut at the top of the hill, drunk out of my mind on tua sabu (local palm brandy) gawping at the huge, sprawling hills coloured with an uneven patchwork of treetops, bare earth and the occasional herd of goats. I&apos;d stumbled on my own Arcadia, and I didn&apos;t have to share it with anyone. I sauntered back down the hill towards base camp - more huts and a makeshift marquee - where about 100 Timorese people had gathered for some kind of ceremony. As we drew closer down the final descent, the sound of drumming rose. I looked down at the mass of people. Everyone was dancing. Two chaps beat a drum while old women smoked cigarettes and clanged gongs with pieces of wood. It was like some kind of eco-rave, fuelled on tua sabu and dollar-a-bottle whisky. And the best thing was that it was totally authentic, not some sort of show. I was the only foreigner there. As I danced (ignoring the grisly sight of three buffalo heads hanging from hooks on the side of a wooden building) a one-armed man with fuzzy white hair jived over, his solitary hand clasping a cup of tua sabu. He held it aloft, giving me a series of emphatic nods, smiles and cheers. He took an interest in my yellow wristband, so I gave it to him and he roared &quot;East Timor!&quot; before bumbling off on his merry way. Every night I stayed in Manetu, once the old folks had settled down to chew the fat, the countryside youngsters clad in neo-punk outfits fired up a sound system and we had a disco. The DJ - using cassette tapes - played the same half-a-dozen Portuguese songs over and over and we danced until 6am each morning, at which point the drumming would begin again. This particular ceremony, a family event to honour dead relatives and strengthen cultural and community ties, attracted people from neighbouring villages, who walked for miles through the hills with offerings of pigs, goats and booze.  Ceremonies like this happen all over East Timor throughout the year and for travellers who spend a little time getting to know the local people, there&apos;s no reason why they won&apos;t stumble on similar cultural festivities. This was a full-on, smack-you-in-the-face adventure - but it&apos;s the kind of experience that awaits anyone prepared to go way off the beaten track, take risks and dive headfirst into the country.

New hotspots for intrepid gappers Sierra Leone The country has some of the most beautiful beaches in West Africa: palm-lined white sands with excellent surf - those along the peninsulas of Freetown, the capital, and Turner are the most stunning. The Outamba-Kilimi National Park in the north is home to an impressive array of wildlife - chimpanzees, elephants, hippos and antelopes. The Foreign Office no longer advises against travel here, although it does state that general infrastructure is poor and caution should be taken in Freetown. \u2022 welcometosierraleone.org Algeria Although certain areas of Algeria are still considered off-limits by the FCO, Lonely Planet put it on its must-visit list this year. The country offers spectacular ancient sites and beautiful beaches if you&apos;re prepared to tackle the roads and take your chances with a hire car (independent travel without a car is practically non-existent). Dj\u00e9mila is one of North Africa&apos;s most impressive Roman sites, while the Tassili N&apos;ajjer national park has a vast amount of Saharan rock art. \u2022 algerianconsulate-uk.com Jammu &amp; Kashmir The FCO advises against travel through rural areas of Jammu and Kashmir (apart from Ladakh) and there is a relatively high threat of terrorist attacks in the area. But in spite of this, tourists are starting to return, drawn to the breathtaking trekking routes north of Pahalgam and the tranquil houseboats of Srinagar. If you visit in the winter months, take advantage of the fine powder snow, and spend a day or two skiing at Gulmarg. \u2022 jktourism.org Samoa Natural disasters are the biggest threat on Samoa - named this year by Lonely Planet Australia as a backpacker hotspot - which is located on the Pacific &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; and experiences regular volcanic and seismic activity.

We were in Calangute, northern Goa, a beach resort which lost its charm a couple of decades ago and is now a rather over-developed touristy town for package holidaymakers. The main street was filthy and strewn with rubbish and the odd cow - an additional worry as I ran down it, or rather stumbled down it, with Albie in my arms trying to find a hospital, dentist, anything or anyone who could help. It had only been the usual poolside frolics when baby teeth met dad&apos;s hard head with loud and gory consequences. Then an angel appeared. Actually a charming shopkeeper, who looked at Albie and pointed to a row of hand-painted signs displaying gleaming teeth and various dental instruments, and directed me up a dark and dirty stair well. It was at that point that I turned to my husband Sam and screamed: &quot;I want to go home ... NOW!&quot; But we couldn&apos;t. We had let our house in England out to strangers and were only at the beginning of what was meant to be a year-long, round-the-world family adventure. I had it all figured out: me, my husband and our two young boys were to travel the world and immerse ourselves in various welcoming communities and exotic culture. Before kids and domesticity, I had trekked up mountains, lived in mud huts and slept under the stars on remote islands. I had worked the sarong and headband look to great effect, I knew how to travel and a couple of minor details, like my one- and three-year-old children, weren&apos;t going to stop me now.  Call it a mid-life crisis, call it complete madness, but we had decided a change from our hectic London life was needed. I had just finished a masters degree, Sam was to take a career break, and we had one more year before the kids started school. We were going in search of ...something else. And so we packed up our house and two rather large rucksacks (mercifully now on wheels) and headed off to Heathrow. It felt fantastic: 18 again - except for the two buggies in tow. First stop: Goa. A friend had found a house in Patnem village, south of Palolem. Less the old Portuguese colonial with big verandas that we had hoped for, more three bare rooms, a cold shower and a Baby Belling for a kitchen. But it was right on the beach and at only \u00a35 a night, living with a little less heritage was tolerable. What wasn&apos;t was the monsoon - we were constantly damp and splattered in red mud, and my fantastically light packing meant that we ran out of dry clothes after three days. My mind occasionally wandered to fantasies of plonking the kids in front of CBeebies. Instead we re-read the six children&apos;s books we had brought with us, played spaceship troopers in Indian saris, and danced to the Grease soundtrack - a last-minute addition to my iPod that turned out to be a godsend. We spent day after day trying to entertain them indoors. I had wanted to spend time with my kids but this was ridiculous. Shopping in local shops and markets so we could cook at home had always been my plan, but I had also fondly imagined breakfast at beachside cafes where my children would feast on the best banana pancakes on the planet. However having arrived in October the tourist season hadn&apos;t yet started, and the restaurants were closed. We tried to tempt our boys with idlis and puris at the chai house, but they weren&apos;t keen so we fell back on eggs and that Baby Belling. Eventually we discovered the Fernandez Caf\u00e9 at the far end of Palolem Beach which opened a month before any other. An hour&apos;s broiling trek was rewarded with cold beers and great squid and chips that we munched as we watched fishermen haul in their catch. After a little mental adjustment, I realised that these hitches were a small price to pay for how free we felt. As the sun set over the Indian Ocean we stopped worrying about Albie&apos;s countless mosquito bites and the daily struggle to get Arlo to take the disgusting malaria pills. Life was grand, and eventually it stopped raining too. Then Arlo fell and broke his collar-bone and Albie knocked his two front teeth out. At the hospital, the service was fantastic and the medical equipment efficient and gleaming, despite the dirty stairwells and rustic furniture. For Arlo&apos;s broken collar bone we saw two specialists and were told all would be well in a week - for \u00a37.25. And it turned out there couldn&apos;t be a better place to have a dental problem as Goa was a hotspot for dental tourism. Albie had his teeth stuck back in place and I had mine whitened while we were at it. I realised that as long as I did enormous amounts of deep breathing, managed to stay positive despite daily mishaps and reworked the script of my mid-life fantasy (forget any notion of relaxation), our year-long odyssey could work. Putting my new zen-like approach to the test, we then headed to Vietnam. We had planned a two-month trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, staying in low-budget hotels. This usually meant rooms on the eighth floor or above and no lift.  However, the excitement of arriving somewhere new propelled us down the several hundred stairs and onto the street to face several million mopeds and motorbikes. &quot;When crossing the road, find a gap and go for it, look straight ahead, don&apos;t run and don&apos;t stop,&quot; a friend advised. With two buggies this proved quite a challenge. But we managed. We even started using the motorbike taxis, the days of insisting on car seats were behind us.  After a few days of amazing food, we&apos;d had enough of the hectic city, so we kept moving, to just about every temple, palace and pagoda in the land. We whizzed down sand dunes on plastic sheets with the local kids, crawled through Vietcong tunnels and paddled in sampan boats with cone-hatted grannies around the Mekong Delta. It was utterly fascinating but a little exhausting so our arrival in New Zealand, with huge empty landscapes, was a welcome relief. We set off from Christchurch in our enormous six-berth motorhome for a five-week tour of the South Island, staying in campsites in amazing locations. We parked on wild and deserted beaches and collected mussels for our supper. We camped by mountain lakes where, despite looking like we were ready for nuclear war in our anti-sandfly outfits, we spent the evenings sipping delicious wine and watching the kids run around like dogs finally off their leash. We could go anywhere and the boys thrilled to the cries of &quot;climb aboard&quot; as we headed off in their magic bus to yet another perfect spot. It was stunning, like Scotland on steroids but with sunshine, plus the best fish and chips in the world. We had a quick week-long Australian road trip from Sydney to Byron Bay before landing in Bali - another total mind-shift. Having turned all rugged and outdoors-y we suddenly found ourselves in an amazing fully-staffed house in Umulas, 15 minutes north of groovy Seminyak. Rented for the same price as a pitch on a French campsite, it was a typical Balinese no-solid-walls no fence-around-the-pool sort of affair. Think pavilions with wafty muslin. Absolutely stunning, but a death trap for non-swimming toddlers. Thankfully we found there was a fence that could be erected around the pool.  I was able to relax on that padded lounger after all. And relax we did. While the boys attended a playgroup for ex-pat kids, we joined a sports club up the coast in Canggu with an air-conditioned library and aqua aerobics in its palm-fringed pool. We had amazing massages, ate delicious sushi and I had my roots done while keeping to our \u00a3100-a-day budget. We were so blissed-out it was hard to leave but there were still two months left. We were a little travel weary so we decided to spend them touring France in a VW campervan. With some new bikes, we cycled across what felt like most of the country with the kids on the back. As we neared home I started trying to cram their feet into shoes and nagged them constantly to stop eating with their fingers. Their year away had turned them into inquisitive, confident - if occasionally wild - little boys who would eat anything, talk to everyone, and had learned to argue very well. What did I learn? Don&apos;t try to re-live your original gap year. With kids in tow you probably won&apos;t be able to hike up to the hill-top tribe or join in that late-night beach party. Do it. Absolutely do it, but do it differently.  Strange food, long journeys and foreign illnesses just weren&apos;t a problem. It was the non-stop backpacking and living in small hotel rooms that proved the most challenging. Where it worked best was when we rented a base for a couple of months and ventured out for little mini-breaks. You can still have that thrilling feeling of the exotic, but with a comforting day-to-day familiarity. And that way find a babysitter too. I was totally unprepared for the reality of travelling with two tiny and rather demanding characters, who didn&apos;t even carry their own bags. It was one of the hardest things I&apos;ve ever done. But now that time has helped erode some of the more painful memories it was also the greatest adventure. Real storiesThe grey gappers James Birrell, 61 I was a corporate lawyer in Edinburgh but worked largely away from home, and decided I would retire as soon as possible to make the most of life. Each of our three children had enjoyed, or were to enjoy, a gap year, so when I retired at the age of 52, my wife Angela and I started planning our three journeys: to south-east Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Australasia. As older travellers, there were a few extra considerations - we knew it was important to be fit before we left, know our limitations and have decent travel insurance. Our trip began with two weeks in Borneo, climbing Mount Kinabalu, staying in an Iban longhouse where, despite the human skulls hanging from the timbers of these (now retired) headhunters, we were astonished by how much we had in common. We flew on to Singapore, went overland to Bangkok via Malaysia&apos;s sights, to Vietnam and Thailand. The majority of people we met were younger than us, but they responded to us as equals as we had shared experiences, and it was nice to get to know people our children&apos;s age. We were also able to offer them advice as we had more life experience. The main advantage of being older travellers was having more money, so we could treat ourselves to nice accommodation. We waited a year before our next stint to India, Nepal, Tibet and Sri Lanka. In Nepal we were fortunate to have Dasharath Rai as our trekking guide - a lovely man with loads of experience who also runs an orphanage in Kathmandu (gracetrek.com.np). We will never forget dawn on the Ganges at Varanasi, &quot;our&quot; tiger at Ranthambore, or the encounter with the university professor with the fantastic tenor voice in the caves at Ellora. We left our next big adventure in Australasia until last, expecting it to be the least demanding in physical terms. However we were dogged by illness (heavy colds and bronchitis). We were grateful for the ease of driving our own campervan and by the time we reached New Zealand we felt adventurous (and well) enough to tour the north by motorbike. We planned each trip, but with as little pre-booking as possible, for flexibility. Because I&apos;d just retired and was used to working, I was inclined to do lots of research. We were more organised than the younger people we met. We realised how important it was not to expect to travel as we would have done at 18 - hostels would have been too exhausting. And our children&apos;s tips from their own gap years didn&apos;t help much. Thankfully we didn&apos;t need to know how to kill hostel bedbugs and where to party all night! Real storiesThe career gapper Ash Dawson, 35, currently in Cordoba, Argentina When the credit crunch hit I was working in IT in Manchester, and as a short-term contractor I was one of the first to be made redundant. I&apos;d always planned to visit South America. I was going to a wedding in Australia at Christmas and was going to do some travelling after that, but as soon as I lost my job I brought it forward. Within about five weeks of being made redundant I was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, trying to learn Spanish. My plan was to be in Buenos Aires for two months and then head north, up to Bolivia, then through Peru, Ecuador and Colombia before flying out of Brazil to Australia for the wedding. Almost three months in and I can honestly say I&apos;m having the time of my life. It took a bit of adjusting to at first; Buenos Aires is a vast city, which came as something of a shock after Manchester and it was also a little disconcerting that so few people spoke English. It&apos;s completely different to Europe - something as simple as buying a mobile phone or having your hair cut can be quite a challenge - but that means you always have good stories. I&apos;d signed up for an eight-week intensive Spanish course and I&apos;d advise anyone coming to South America for a decent amount of time to do the same thing; having Spanish is essential. I had allowed \u00a31,000 a month to live on - about half of what it would cost me in Manchester - and although I may have overspent a little in Buenos Aires (it&apos;s a 24-hour city, so very hard not to) overall the cost of living is astoundingly cheap. I travelled up to Mendoza, the wine-producing region, where a bottle of top-class Malbec goes for about \u00a32.50 - perfect with a juicy Argentinian steak. At the moment I&apos;m in Cordoba, a big bustling university city. I&apos;m travelling alone, but there are so many people doing the same thing, and we all have the same fear about how to meet people, that everyone is keen to meet up and go out together. I&apos;ve had some great nights out, but I do think it&apos;s best to try and meet and talk to local people; it&apos;s definitely been the best way to improve my Spanish. If I hadn&apos;t taken this chance, I&apos;d just be sitting around applying for jobs - and I know a lot of people who are doing that back in Manchester. But this is the best thing I&apos;ve ever done and I&apos;d recommend it to anyone. I don&apos;t see it as a risk career-wise, because I still keep a check on the job situation - all the hostels have Wi-Fi - and if anything interesting did come up I can just jump on a flight and go home. My plan is to head on up to Bolivia and we&apos;ll see what happens from there. I think it&apos;s important to be fairly flexible and allow the experiences to happen to you. And they do ... I met a Brazilian girl and we went to Iguaz\u00fa Falls and she said she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. I never got offers like that in Manchester. \u2022 See Ash&apos;s blog at getjealous.com/ad1974"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/16/asian-models-fashion-catwalk-success", "sentences": ["The show, which appeared online in June, follows 10 aspiring models from Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and India as they compete for a prize of $10,000 and the chance of fame.", "Karen Seah, of Singapore-based media group Refinery Media, came up with the idea after witnessing &quot;a growing market for Japanese and Chinese models&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-15T23:05:24Z", "title": "Breakthrough in fashion for Asia's new supermodels", "tags": ["Models", "Fashion", "Life and style", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "The monopoly of white models on the catwalks and in the glossies over the past decade has been immovable, but many fashionistas now believe the future is Asian. As Cond\u00e9 Nast prepares to launch GQ China, its fourth Chinese title, and Vogue India increases its print run to 50,000 copies a month, British model scouts say a new demand for Asian talent is being created that will transform the face of fashion. Carole White, founder of Premier Model Management, the agency that represents Naomi Campbell and Salman Rushdie&apos;s former wife, Padma Lakshmi, thinks the dominance of eastern European girls is changing. &quot;We are now seeing more Chinese and Japanese girls. Eastern European girls flooded the market. There are so many Russians and Ukrainians. But they are all very white and bland.&quot; Height remains a problem but, White says, &quot;there are tall Asian girls&quot;. Paula Karaiskos, of leading British model agency Storm Model Management, thinks that the distinct look provided by Asian models will ensure longevity and success. &quot;The whole discussion about using more ethnic women in fashion has broadened the debate on models in fashion in general and designers are now looking for more discerning faces to front their campaigns.&quot; Agencies expect next month&apos;s 25th London fashion week to hasten change. There was an Asian model in almost every show last February and agencies expect a marked increase in the months ahead. Most prominent were Japanese model Tao Okamoto, for Moschino, Marc Jacobs and D&amp;G, and Chinese model Liu Wen, for Chanel, Dries Van Noten and Louis Vuitton. The UK high street has already shown signs of a changing preference, with Next deciding to use 23-year-old Anglo-Asian model, Kiren Modi, as the face of its spring line. Leading fashion photographer Gavin Fernandes thinks it&apos;s high time Asian models took the lead. &quot;There is a popular misconception that south and east Asian models are too bound to the principles of their parents. But those stereotypes have been broken down,&quot; he says. &quot;Perhaps scouts just need to get better at spotting Asian talent.&quot; The potential for stardom became evident after the &quot;black issue&quot; of Italian Vogue launched Jourdan Dunn into &quot;super-modeldom&quot;: fashion bloggers now regularly refer to the &quot;Dunn-effect&quot;. The Asian model tipped for Dunn-like hysteria is 26-year-old Lakshmi Menon, currently on show in the windows of Gap. Menon recently featured in her first US Vogue editorial and has appeared on the cover of V magazine. She modelled exclusively for Riccardo Tisci&apos;s last show. Karaiskos, whose agency represents Menon, maintains that skin colour is irrelevant: &quot;The fact that she&apos;s Indian only makes her more interesting.&quot; London Fashion Week&apos;s key backstage photographer, Jason Lloyd-Evans, said: &quot;When I first did the shows about 10 years ago, Devon [Aoki] was the only Asian girl I noticed. There&apos;s now a huge presence from Korea, China and Japan.&quot;. He predicts Okamoto will be the next big thing. &quot;Her tomboy attitude means she is not fitting any particular typecast.&quot; She is described by White as &quot;flavour of the month&quot;. This autumn, Okamoto is the face of Ralph Lauren and Michael Kors and has appeared recently in French and Russian Vogue. It was the summer launch of Supermodelme.tv that gave Asian models a boost. The show, which appeared online in June, follows 10 aspiring models from Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and India as they compete for a prize of $10,000 and the chance of fame. Karen Seah, of Singapore-based media group Refinery Media, came up with the idea after witnessing &quot;a growing market for Japanese and Chinese models&quot;. Even so, modelling has yet to attract the same kudos in the south and east Asian communities as in the west. White says that many Asian girls view modelling as a &quot;hobby&quot; to pursue much later in life than their European counterparts. Ashanti Omkar, former editor of Asian lifestyle magazine Henna, says change will not happen overnight. &quot;An increase in the number of Asian models is to be expected, but it will take time. Many young Asian girls don&apos;t think of modelling as a career.&quot; Omkar blames their low-key private life: &quot;Maybe they&apos;re not creating the same buzz as the Kate Mosses because they don&apos;t have the scandalous lifestyle to go with it.&quot; Twenty years ago, supermodels such as Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer were as big as the brands they represented, whereas the lookalike &quot;blank canvas&quot; models of earlier decades threw attention back on to a generation of designers such as Gaultier, Galliano and McQueen. Now with an increasingly individual look favoured by designers, Karaiskos thinks that the distinct look offered by Asian girls is their unique selling point. &quot;At the moment there is a trend to book either a well known face or an \u00fcbermodel \u2013 a fantastically beautiful goddess whose face is worth a thousand words and whose looks do all the communicating. For a lot of the high-end designers, the latter is more popular.&quot; Some cynics, however, have dismissed south and east Asian models as simply a return to the &quot;exotic&quot;. Navaz Batliwalla, a columnist for Indian Grazia, believes this concept is dated. &quot;As the profile of Indian fashion and celebrity rises, we will embrace that culture over here. Exotic stereotyping is boring and a clich\u00e9&quot; In the past, Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines in Asia rarely used Asian girls. When Batliwalla launched Indian Grazia almost two years ago, she recalled the first shoot: &quot;They sent three models for a casting \u2013 one Indian and two Europeans.&quot; As White said: &quot;Everything in fashion changes so, yes, it will change.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/16/schools-gove-education-sats", "sentences": ["Go to Sweden or Holland (or South Korea, Singapore or Finland) and pick up a few wheezes to peddle as an election comes."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-16T18:00:00Z", "title": "Change is the\u00a0enemy | Peter Preston", "tags": ["Sats", "Michael Gove", "Ed Balls", "Politics", "Education", "Higher education", "UK news"], "article": "Take one motivated teacher, one eager class \u2013 and the answer is education. Take that same teacher, same class and a ruck of politicians shouting the odds, and you&apos;ll be lucky to hear the question, let alone find an answer. &quot;In countries [that] perform best educationally, from Finland to South Korea, it&apos;s academics, not politicians, who preside over the exam system,&quot; says Michael Gove, one of David Cameron&apos;s more wide-awake shadows. He&apos;s absolutely right. Time for him to shut up and sit down, then? Alas not. For, of course, there&apos;s a big vote looming, and as Gove himself says: &quot;No political slogans are ever quite as empty as those uttered at election time.&quot; So\u00a0his hands-off approach lasts about two seconds as he denounces Labour&apos;s &quot;meddling, micro-managing and dumbing down [of] our exam system&quot;. Instead, taking office next year, he&apos;ll micro-manage in a reverse direction, producing league tables with higher points for subjects he reveres, and fewer for those that make him sniff, such as media studies and cake decorating. Think more terms of jittery confusion. Think unintended consequences slowly realised. Think Duckworth-Lewis as bad light stops learning. Meanwhile, over in the government we actually have as opposed to the government we&apos;ll get, there&apos;s a move to scrap league tables altogether \u2013 in favour of more general ratings for good behaviour and the like \u2013 while Sats testings further down the age range fade away in the face of union wrath. (Mr proactive Gove, incidentally, wants to shift Sats at age 11 from last knockings in junior school to first business on joining secondary education, thus making sure that nobody involved feels pain, blame or even much interest.) Meddling, in context, seems the mildest word. Two decades ago, when Kenneth Baker reigned, the\u00a0Tories had two bright objectives. They wanted to end the narrow elitism of selection that had given England a denuded talent base, and they wanted to make sure that all children had a fair chance of being taught the same vital things by a competent teaching force. Enter, at last, a national curriculum. Enter, more gradually, league tables bringing transparency to bear. It was, at least, a coherent way to go, given the disjunct starting point. But be clear now that&apos;s actually going nowhere. Sats, in the face of staff room ire, are shrivelled, disappearing things. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have gone their own sweet way over league tables and the rest. The curriculum lists like a holed ocean liner under the ludicrous weight of political additions piled on board. And yet the fundamental issue of distrust remains when teachers want to run their own show and carry out key stage tests in an informal, unstressed way. &quot;We don&apos;t think moderated teacher assessment is anywhere near good enough for us to use as an accountability measure,&quot; cheeps the schools minister for England only. Everything, over 20 milling, churning years, has changed: but everything, at the heart of the matter, is also much the same. The politicians preaching educational revolution \u2013 Butler, Crosland, Thatcher, Baker and too many more \u2013 have come and gone. Two steps forward, three steps back. Teacher world is still utterly non-professional, still split into quarrelsome segments. Whitehall has moved, via assorted quangos, to the centre of the action \u2013 rather, as wanly before, merely issuing advisory &quot;circulars&quot; and hoping someone will read them. Local education authorities either remain in charge or are pushed to the peripheries. The Institute of Directors goes on bellyaching about recruits who can&apos;t read or add up. Youth\u00a0unemployment soars. This isn&apos;t a collective record of anything but bleak disappointment, a massive vote of scant confidence in Ed Balls and whoever would have followed him if he had got himself made chancellor of the exchequer last spring. Go to Sweden or Holland (or South Korea, Singapore or Finland) and pick up a few wheezes to peddle as an election comes. But don&apos;t, for a moment, forget the one thing that British education, in its increasingly fissiparous way, tells the rest of the world: that constant tinkering by here-today-gone-tomorrow office holders is a recipe for constant failure. That secretaries of state can&apos;t touch what goes on in class. That change is the enemy, not the solution. That letting teachers know best might actually help them deliver better in a proper, professional way. Education as mighty election issue? No: as no issue at all."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/17/japan-beats-recession-exports", "sentences": ["China, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong reported growth in the three months to June."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-17T07:16:36Z", "title": "Japan emerges from deep recession", "tags": ["Global economy", "Global recession", "Japan", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "    Japan has emerged from its worst recession since the end of the second world war, recording its first quarter of growth for more than a year amid a rise in exports. Japan&apos;s fledgling recovery saw gross domestic product (GDP) rise at an annualised rate of 3.7% from April to June, and by 0.9% from the previous three months, the cabinet office said. Exports rose 6.3% from three months earlier, the first increase since the start of 2008 and the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2002. The emergence of the world&apos;s second-largest economy from recession follows last week&apos;s news that Germany and France \u2013 the two biggest economies in the eurozone \u2013 returned to growth in the second quarter. Freefalling global demand for the consumer durables on which Japan built its economic success \u2013 notably consumer electronics and cars \u2013 were to blame for dragging it into a recession from which few believed it would emerge so quickly. The guarded optimism now surrounding Japan is shared elsewhere. The US economy shrank at an annualised 1% last quarter, its smallest contraction in a year, while the 0.1% contraction seen in the eurozone was its best showing for more than a year. China&apos;s economy, helped by a vast $586bn (\u00a3357bn) stimulus package, grew 7.9% from a year earlier. The figures appear to bear out prime minister Taro Aso&apos;s assurance that Japan would be one of the first major economies to emerge from recession, although polls suggest they probably will not be enough to save his Liberal Democratic party from defeat in the general election in a fortnight&apos;s time. Though parts of his \u00a525tn (\u00a3160bn) stimulus package were derided \u2013 in particular the cash handouts to all residents \u2013 those, together with subsidies for fuel-efficient cars and green electrical appliances, have produced at least some short-term benefits. Experts warned, however, that the recovery could quickly fizzle out without improvements in demand at home, where falling wages and job fears have hit household spending. Unemployment is at a six-year high of 5.4% and could rise to a record 5.8% next year. In addition, wages fell 1.7% in the last quarter, while consumer spending, which accounts for 55% of the economy, rose just 0.8% from the previous three months. Public investment, buoyed by the government stimulus, was up 8.1%. Private capital investment dropped 4.3% from the previous quarter, while housing investment fell 9.5%, the government said. Hiroshi Watanabe, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo, said: &quot;When you look at the numbers, the contrast between external demand and internal demand is as clear as night and day. With payments falling, it&apos;s really hard to expect individual spending to hold up.&quot; Still, even modest, export-led growth offers respite after more than a year of contraction that included a record 13.1% annualised drop in GDP in the last quarter of last year and an 11.7% fall in the first quarter of this year. Yoshimasa Hayashi, the economic and fiscal policy minister, warned of continued threats to sustained recovery. &quot;Production is still at a low level, and worries remain that employment conditions will worsen,&quot; he said. &quot;So we must watch the downside risks.&quot; The Asia-Pacific region has surprised many analysts with the speed of its recovery.

The intentions behind Diaspora are admirable. But it provides lots of information and very few emotional connections, and its layering of music, video and live storytelling is so unimaginatively executed that in preaching its message of tolerance it is in danger of making you feel quite intolerant towards theatre. This is not some dull but worthy little fringe show, it&apos;s one of the centrepieces of the international festival theatre programme. You can see all the money and resources chucked at it in the wraparound video, use of technology and the presence of the 75-strong Singapore Chinese Orchestra. It is the latter, with its mix of ancient and modern sounds and instruments, and openness to old and new traditions, that lends the evening what little substance and emotional clout that it has.

They stumbled on an issue that embarrasses David Cameron and generates genuine public support, ranging from old-fashioned letters to the editor to hyperactivity on Twitter and the blogosphere. Unfortunately for Labour the issue is not as shiny new as Twitter. It is the NHS, that old election standby whenever the party of Aneurin Bevan is in a tight electoral corner. Will it work again next time? Andy Burnham, Gordon Brown&apos;s health secretary, hopes so. In yesterday&apos;s Guardian he claimed to detect new dividing lines between the main parties on healthcare. None of this was on Downing Street&apos;s media grid for August. But the ferocity of the debate now engulfing Barack Obama&apos;s plans to reform America&apos;s healthcare system \u2013 which is brilliant but unfair, expensive and inefficient \u2013 has spilled over into Britain for two reasons. Diehard US opponents of Britain&apos;s &quot;socialist, fascist&quot; (sic) NHS are using it \u2013 and Canada&apos;s publicly funded system \u2013 to attack Obama. And the publicity-minded Tory MEP Daniel Hannan joined the onslaught. It was Hannan&apos;s description of the NHS as &quot;a 60-year-old mistake&quot; which Americans must avoid at all costs that lit the blue touchpaper on rabid Fox TV. Labour pounced on it, a &quot;welovethenhs&quot; hashtag went viral on Twitter and Cameron was forced to dismiss his pushy young colleague&apos;s slapdash views \u2013 most of the 1.4 million NHS staff are administrators, claimed Hannan \u2013 as &quot;eccentric&quot;. Andrew Lansley, the party&apos;s health spokesman, duly popped up to reassure voters for the umpteenth time that the detoxed Cameroon Tories really do embrace the core principles of the NHS: taxpayer-funded and free at the point of use, unless you count dentistry and hospital parking fees. After all, everyone knows how it looked after the Camerons&apos; late son, Ivan. In reality both parties have compromised in the worldwide search for a fair and affordable healthcare system in an age when non-smoking, fit people live longer but end-of-life care, not to mention hi-tech cures for chronic conditions, cost a lot. As New Labour&apos;s leftwing critics on the blogosphere never cease to complain, the party embraced choice and market competition. Burnham himself is said to be keener to promote the Blairite purchaser/provider split pioneered in the 80s by Ken Clarke than was Alan Johnson. Although he criticised Lansley yesterday for promoting local pay bargaining (would the Tories tackle the GPs&apos; inflated contract as well as Unison?), he too favours local decision-making. He may not like Lansley&apos;s idea for an arm&apos;s-length management board to run the NHS either \u2013 even Bupa-types have doubts \u2013 but has long championed his own version of an NHS constitution. It is not that no policy differences survive (will Lansley really abolish targets such as the 18-week hospital wait, or simply call them something else?), only that they are narrower than for decades. It may not matter to some voters. What the shrill US debate suggests is that healthcare reform has become part of the ongoing &quot;culture wars&quot; between modernisers and those millions of Americans who don&apos;t travel and fear that aliens are taking over their country \u2013 with NHS-style &quot;death panels&quot; of bureaucrats who decide who lives and dies. Such bizarre talk drowns out rational debate, also available on some websites, about the strengths and weaknesses of US, UK, French, German, and Singapore (Hannan&apos;s preferred model) healthcare systems: all have their problems. There are echoes of cultural irrationality in the British debate where the NHS is either perfect or a Stalinist monster, Hannan either a traitor or a libertarian hero. The trend to watch is actually growing convergence and co-operation on health within the EU. Now that poses a real dilemma for a Cameron cabinet."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/19/qantas-sees-signs-of-hope", "sentences": ["&quot;I am not saying it has got better because it has not.&quot; Singapore Airlines, the world&apos;s second-largest carrier by market value, recently made its first quarterly loss in six years and warned that it could report a loss for the full year if conditions did not improve."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-19T19:46:34Z", "title": "Qantas sees signs of hope despite 88% profit fall", "tags": ["Airline industry", "British Airways", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Qantas"], "article": "  Qantas, Australia&apos;s national carrier, has confirmed signs of stabilisation in the global airline market despite announcing a A$1.5bn (\u00a3751m) cost-cutting programme and an 88% fall in full-year profits. The airline&apos;s comments follow a slight shift in the mood music from British Airways, its former merger partner, which reported a 1% increase in traffic last month. Qantas said there were signs of improvement in passenger numbers and that yields, or the average revenue per customer, had stopped falling. The International Air Transport Association, which represents the major long-haul carriers, also reported an apparent bottoming out of the industry recession this week. It said passenger numbers in June fell by 7.1% \u2013 an improvement on the 9.2% decline in May. &quot;Passenger travel numbers ... are now indicating some stabilisation in air travel demand,&quot; said IATA. &quot;Adjusting for seasonal fluctuations passenger numbers were broadly unchanged in June compared with levels in May.&quot; However, Qantas&apos;s annual results underlined the scale of the damage being wrought on major airlines by the downturn. Qantas reported a pretax profit of A$181m in the 12 months to the end of June, compared with a profit of A$1.4bn a year ago. Its second-half performance was its worst in six years as it posted a loss of A$93m, although BA lost \u00a3148m in the three months between April and June alone. The global industry is expected to lose $9bn (\u00a35.4bn) this year, according to IATA. Qantas followed the underwhelming results by setting a A$1.5bn cost-savings target over the next three years. It also followed BA in declining to issue a profit outlook for the next 12 months, after admitting that trading conditions were too uncertain. Willie Walsh, BA&apos;s chief executive, said recently that key markets such as London-to-New York now appeared to be in a trough rather than a freefall. &quot;It has not got worse,&quot; he said. &quot;I am not saying it has got better because it has not.&quot; Singapore Airlines, the world&apos;s second-largest carrier by market value, recently made its first quarterly loss in six years and warned that it could report a loss for the full year if conditions did not improve. Airlines are making thousands of redundancies in a bid to match their cost bases with a slump in revenues. They are also negotiating mergers and alliances that could reap multimillion-pound cost savings, including a short-lived attempt by BA and Qantas last year to broker an unlikely merger. IATA said this week that the slowdown in the rate of decline was partly due to airlines slashing prices. Despite the global recession there have only been few airline bankruptcies, leaving a glut of seats on the market and forcing down prices. &quot;The issue now is that this stabilisation of passenger numbers is partly being achieved at the expense of much lower yields, as airlines seek to boost cash flow by making more cheaper seats available,&quot; said the organisation. Business class fares, a key source of profits for long-haul carriers, have declined by about 40% and BA is considering removing business seats from its Boeing 747 seat due to lack of demand. \u2022 The caption with this story was amended on 20 August 2009.

She may be one of the most famous women in the world, at least as far as British editors are concerned, but Victoria Beckham has mysteriously failed to feature on a new list of the world&apos;s ten most powerful women. So have Madonna, Michelle Obama and Carla Sarkozy-Bruni, although America&apos;s First Lady does make her debut further down (at number 40) the complete list of 100 powerful women published annually by Forbes magazine. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, retains the number one spot for the fourth year in a row, apparently because she&apos;s led Germany out of recession sooner than expected \u2013 a feat not really matched, I suppose, by the success of Posh&apos;s first clothes collection. The real surprise lies in the names that occupy the next nine slots, such as Sheila Bair, chairman [sic] of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp in the US and Ho Ching, chief executive of Temasek, Singapore. They appear at number two and number five respectively in a top ten made up, with the exception of Ms Merkel, entirely of businesswomen. Half the top ten are based in the US, which could be explained either by the fact that Forbes is an American magazine or by the dominance of American companies in the international marketplace. They&apos;ve been selected, according to the magazine, on three criteria: economic impact, media reach and career accomplishments. One suspects the ranking is weighted towards the first measure: while I&apos;m sure that Angela Braly, chief executive of Wellpoint, is well-known in her own field, she hardly has the profile of Hillary Clinton (number 36) or Ireland&apos;s president Mary McAleese (a lowly 68). Indeed, what&apos;s striking about the Forbes top ten is its reverence for money. Ten women holding the title of prime minister, chancellor or president make it into the top 100, but Merkel is the sole politician in the top ten. The list has been published only for the last six years, so it&apos;s impossible to know what it would have looked like 25 years ago, but it&apos;s hard to imagine Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi being overlooked in favour of Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Kraft Foods. I&apos;m sure Rosenfeld is a big player in the business world, but is she really the sixth most powerful woman in the world? More influential, better-known and more of a role model than J K Rowling? But then Europe has only 18 entries in the top 100 this year, despite its huge economic and political profile. The UK has four, including the Queen, who arguably has very little real power, and Angela Ahrendts, chief executive of Burberry, who returns to the list at number 70 after dropping off last year. Burberry is a controversial company in the UK, having closed factories in South Yorkshire and South Wales, and has been widely criticised for cutting British jobs and moving production to China. At first sight, the Forbes list looks like bad news for women who aspire to other forms of power: cultural, social and political. But what it really tells us isn&apos;t about powerful women but how power itself is perceived in a country where commerce trumps everything else. Despite the recession, and whether you&apos;re male or female, the US remains a country where money talks louder than anything else."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/19/angela-merkel-michelle-obama-forbes", "sentences": ["In terms of representation in political leadership, the UK is behind countries such as the Scandinavian nations, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Australia.&quot; Women at the top 2008 1 Angela Merkel chancellor, Germany 2 Sheila Bair chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, US 3 Indra Nooyi chairwoman of chief executive of PepsiCo, India 2007 1 Angela Merkel 2 Wu Yivice prime minister, China 3 Ho Ching chief executive officer of Temasek Holdings, Singapore 2006 1 Angela Merkel 2 Condoleezza Rice secretary of state, US 3 Wu Yi 2005 1 Condoleezza Rice 2 Wu Yi 3 Yulia Tymoshenko prime minister, Ukraine 2004 1 Condoleezza Rice 2 Wu Yi 3 Sonia Gandhi president of the Indian National Congress, India"], "publicationDate": "2009-08-20T00:15:00Z", "title": "Forbes' list puts Angela Merkel ahead of Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton", "tags": ["Women", "Women in politics", "Germany", "US news", "UK news", "World news", "Life and style", "Hillary Clinton", "Michelle Obama", "Angela Merkel", "Europe"], "article": "Just back from holiday, looking refreshed weeks before she is expected to win the September election as Germany tentatively eases itself out of recession, Angela Merkel enjoyed more good news today: she is still the most powerful woman in the world. The German chancellor has for the fourth year running topped US magazine Forbes&apos; list of the women with the most clout on the global stage. The ranking comes as Merkel \u2013 who despite often being the only female in world leader line-ups has always avoided being reduced to gender stereotypes \u2013 is at the centre of an unfortunate row over cleavage. In posters, the Christian Democrat candidate Vera Lengsfeld has used a well-known picture of Merkel in a low-cut evening gown at an opera gala last year, alongside one of herself in a generous neck-line above the slogan &quot;We have more to offer.&quot; Some have cried poor taste or sexism, but Merkel has deliberately stayed out of the row. The Forbes women&apos;s power list has for the past six years seen the US business magazine score a publicity coup by branching out from measuring the still male-dominated world&apos;s top billionaires and chief executives to produce a yardstick of 100 top women in politics, business and philanthropy. This year, the US has seen a rise in powerful women in public life, with Sonia Sotomayor, the US supreme court justice, in at 54, and Michele Obama ranked at 40. Influence But the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, trails Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the house of representatives, at number 36. Clinton, who days ago put a Congolese student in his place for asking what her husband Bill Clinton thought about a foreign policy issue, might have expected to be placed higher. In 2005, then secretary of state Condoleeza Rice was rated the world&apos;s number one most powerful woman. US commentators have been raising questions over how much influence and power Clinton wields over international issues in the US administration. Forbes disagreed that Clinton&apos;s ranking was low. &quot;She is an extremely important woman in the government, but she&apos;s not the president. She did run as candidate and didn&apos;t win. If she had, she would have been considered with Merkel for number one,&quot; said Chana Schoenberger, the Forbes associate editor who co-edited the list. &quot;She has been on our list for a long time as very powerful senator before becoming secretary of state. Yes, she&apos;s the spokesperson of the administration on foreign policy issues and does important things, but here she&apos;s competing with a whole group of women who are running things. A lot of the women are running their own countries.&quot; Michele Obama, who ranks just above Oprah Winfrey at 41, is part of a tradition of featuring US first ladies. Schoenberger said of Obama: &quot;She&apos;s not elected but she is the public face of the country and deals with domestic policy in terms of influencing what the president thinks. She&apos;s very much in the public eye.&quot; Among British women, the queen leapt from 58th to 42nd position this year. But women in power on the British business scene were scarce with Cynthia Carroll, only the third female chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, Anglo American, ranked number four, and Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson in the top 20. Angela Ahrendts, chief executive of Burberry, also returned to the list. The Forbes team said it had taken cheer at the rising number of women to choose from, but accepted there was still a fair distance to go. A total of 27 women on the list headed companies, while 10 either run their countries or are heads of state. Newcomers include Iceland&apos;s prime minister Johanna Sig\u00fardardottir and Unicef executive director Ann Veneman, who has boosted the female presence at high levels of UN agencies. Ranking The rankings, based on each woman&apos;s economic impact, media reach, and career accomplishment, highlighted the growing number of women who are running companies, &quot;not just women who inherited companies, as often happened in the past&quot;. There are more women entrepreneurs and women who have worked their way up through traditional corporate enterprises. Of the top 10 women, the majority are business leaders. Only one has a family connection to her business. Rowena Lewis, acting director of the Fawcett Society, said it was good to have a spotlight on women leaders, but cautioned: &quot;Despite these lists, there is still under-representation of women in positions of power across the globe. The representation of women as leaders in the UK in a range of sectors is in decline. Only 11% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are women. In terms of representation in political leadership, the UK is behind countries such as the Scandinavian nations, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Australia.&quot; Women at the top 2008 1 Angela Merkel chancellor, Germany 2 Sheila Bair chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, US 3 Indra Nooyi chairwoman of chief executive of PepsiCo, India 2007 1 Angela Merkel 2 Wu Yivice prime minister, China 3 Ho Ching chief executive officer of Temasek Holdings, Singapore 2006 1 Angela Merkel 2 Condoleezza Rice secretary of state, US 3 Wu Yi 2005 1 Condoleezza Rice 2 Wu Yi 3 Yulia Tymoshenko prime minister, Ukraine 2004 1 Condoleezza Rice 2 Wu Yi 3 Sonia Gandhi president of the Indian National Congress, India"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/23/lewis-hamilton-interview", "sentences": ["Still, McLaren engineers have prepared an upgrade package for the car for Valencia today, with further improvements for Spa-Francorchamps and Singapore next month."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-22T23:01:00Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton talks to Tim Lewis about the worst year of his life", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Life and style", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "A few moments after Lewis Hamilton won the Hungarian grand prix last month, he released his safety harness, stood on the carbon-fibre chassis and, with shades of Basil Fawlty, started banging his fist repeatedly on the &quot;bonnet&quot; of his McLaren-Mercedes. What we were watching, however, was not frustration but extreme elation. It was an unprecedented outpouring of relief from one of the world&apos;s most self-controlled sportsmen. After the worst six months of his life, he was back in the game. Hamilton, a 24-year-old who grew up on a council estate in Stevenage, had enjoyed the most explosive entry to Formula One the sport had ever seen. In 2007, he broke all records for a debutant, driving so brilliantly that he sent his team-mate, two-time, defending world champion Fernando Alonso, to the brink of insanity. Last season, he became the youngest F1 champion in history, in the most nail-biting denouement of all time, shooting round Timo Glock&apos;s Toyota on the final corner of a rain-sodden track in Brazil to clinch the title. He was fast, exciting and so competitive that he boasted that he would not even concede victory to his half-brother, who has cerebral palsy, when they played F1 on the PlayStation.  This year, however, has seen Hamilton crash to earth, his position on the top of the podium taken by another British driver, Jenson Button. Five years older, Button is in many senses the anti-Hamilton. He is the goofy playboy who did not seem to have the aggression or hunger to fulfil his potential in Formula One. The 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell berated Button for partying too much, while his former team-mate Jacques Villeneuve suggested he should be in a boy band. At the precise moment that Hamilton was winning his world title, Button was extricating himself from a broken-down car that had burst into flames. But the 2009 season, which continues today with round 11 of 17 at the Valencia street circuit, has made everyone pause to consider: maybe Button is not just a punchline; perhaps Hamilton is not an ice-veined automaton; and why does anyone care about the drivers when Formula One is so self-evidently about the machine underneath them?  The problems for Hamilton this season have been more than merely wrestling what former team boss and BBC pundit Eddie Jordan has described as &quot;a dog of a car, the worst car that McLaren has ever built&quot;. After the Australian grand prix in March, Hamilton was found guilty of lying to race stewards when, under team orders, he had a hand in attempting to have another driver disqualified.  It has been a spectacular fall from grace, one only partially arrested by that stunning return to form on the track in Hungary. And it is a slump that, no doubt, some will have taken pleasure in. Hamilton has noted that his success in karting made him &quot;less, not more, popular&quot; at school, and there were &quot;a lot of people, and not only some of my competitors&quot; who resented the contract he signed with McLaren in his early teens. His uncompromising approach to racing has made him few friends in Formula One: in his first season, he described how his fellow drivers were waiting &quot;with rifles, ready to shoot me&quot; at a briefing before the China grand prix. In Britain, his public profile was perhaps most seriously damaged by the botched announcement of his move to Lake Geneva in 2007. &quot;I don&apos;t think the public would have a problem with an F1 driver moving away,&quot; says Ted Kravitz, the BBC&apos;s pit-lane reporter. &quot;But it was the way he dealt with it and the reason he gave: &apos;I can&apos;t go out in London any more, I get hassled, I don&apos;t like it.&apos; It was very damaging.&quot; Before last season, Red Bull&apos;s Mark Webber sounded a note of caution that is now unerringly prescient. &quot;His career has gone off like a rocket ship, but it won&apos;t always be like that,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s young and he&apos;s black, which makes him unique in this sport, but that&apos;s got a shelf life. He won&apos;t stop being black but it will stop being a novelty.&quot; &quot;The question is: why do people feel better about Jenson Button potentially winning the championship this year than Lewis Hamilton?&quot; asks Kravitz. &quot;I did always think that Lewis was very popular, but you start to wonder. Jenson is certainly a more accessible character; he has a spark in his eye, he will take the piss out of himself.&quot; Despite everything that would make Hamilton&apos;s story a fairytale success - his youth, his ethnicity, his determination - for some he remains strangely hard to relate to. He&apos;s too neat, too controlled, too arrogant. In short, too good to be true. Could a bit of failure, a glimmer of weakness, be just what he needs for the British public to learn to love him? &quot;The traffic was terrible,&quot; says Hamilton, a few minutes late, sounding like he was picking off awkward back-markers in a grand prix rather than negotiating London in the morning rush hour. He fixes you with unblinking eye contact and pumps your hand fiercely. His handshake is legendary; McLaren&apos;s team principal Martin Whitmarsh even remembers it from when he met the 10-year-old Hamilton: &quot;It was quite surreal when he did it as a little boy. That purposeful determination was always there with Lewis.&quot; The location for today&apos;s Lewis Hamilton opportunity, courtesy of his sponsor Hugo Boss, is the studio in Stoke Newington, east London, where they film Dragons&apos; Den (a show that has, it seems, not made it out to Switzerland yet). Hamilton is wearing a hoodie, jeans and white Reebok trainers with fluorescent laces, an outfit that sounds like it should be scruffy but on him is precise and immaculate. He is short and powerful, with a tree-trunk neck (his collar size increased by more than an inch during his first season in F1) and sticky-out Obama ears. The evening before we meet, Michael Schumacher announced he would be making a shock return to Formula One, taking the seat at Ferrari vacated by Felipe Massa after his freak head injury last month (to everyone&apos;s dismay, Schumacher has since announced that he has abandoned the comeback). Hamilton has always said that Schumacher is the former driver that he would most like to race against, and today he breaks into a wide, gap-toothed smile when his name comes up. &quot;Jeez, it will be huge,&quot; he says. &quot;When racing&apos;s in your blood, like it is in his, I&apos;m sure he&apos;s there to fight.&quot; Hamilton - whom Ted Kravitz had described as &quot;absolutely miserable&quot; for the first half of the season - is clearly in bullish mood today, no doubt buoyed by spending last night watching his victory in Hungary, his first win since the China grand prix last October. He does not usually revisit his races but he was back at the family home in Hertfordshire for the night and needed something to do while he ate dinner - &quot;I always have to watch something while I&apos;m eating otherwise I get bored,&quot; he admits. &quot;I&apos;m a racing driver, an adrenaline junkie, aren&apos;t I? Anything with a low heart-rate, I fall asleep.&quot; He also wanted to see how he came across on the TV coverage &quot;because I don&apos;t get to see that so often, so it&apos;s good to be able to see that from the public&apos;s view&quot;. Did he learn anything? &quot;It&apos;s funny to watch my dad,&quot; he decides. &quot;He&apos;s so serious. It&apos;s like he&apos;s driving himself, controlling the race. We sat there and just laughed about that.&quot;  Anthony Hamilton - father, manager, agent - has been a contentious figure in Lewis&apos;s career. Although he had no background in racing himself, Anthony has moulded his son from an early age into his vision of the ultimate driving machine. His attention to detail has been astonishing - from keeping his go-kart clean, because he knew McLaren liked it that way, to ensuring that Lewis stayed out of trouble at school. When, just before his GCSEs, Hamilton was mistakenly suspended from John Henry Newman School in Stevenage for fighting, Anthony worked tirelessly to clear his name, even sending a letter to Tony Blair. When the matter was finally resolved, he moved the family out of the area and enrolled Lewis in a new school. Hamilton first met McLaren CEO Ron Dennis at the age of 10. Hamilton told him he wanted to drive his F1 cars; Dennis told him to come back in nine years. When Hamilton was 13 McLaren started helping him with karts, engines and transport. While many would have deferred to McLaren&apos;s stewardship - they have, after all, produced 12 world champions and guided the careers of Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Mika Hakkinen - Anthony has never been afraid to stand up to Dennis. Their relationship even deteriorated enough for McLaren to withdraw their support for Hamilton when he was racing in formula three in 2004. However, it is hard not to admire the tenacity and single-mindedness that Anthony - who famously worked three jobs at various stages when Lewis was growing up, including putting up estate agent signs for 50p a time - has shown in getting a mixed-race kid with no connections to the top of the world&apos;s richest and most nepotistic sport. &quot;My dad has been to every single race in my whole life,&quot; says Hamilton, before repeating incredulously, &quot;every single race I&apos;ve ever done. Every competition, from remote-control cars to go-karting, single-seaters, Formula One, that&apos;s thousands of races since I was eight years old. Still today on the grid he comes out and we always hug before qualifying and again before the start of the race, and I get in the car and we always do our handshake which I made up when I was eight. It&apos;s that special.&quot; It probably helped that Hamilton was winning most of these early races. All Formula One drivers have had seriously impressive careers before making the step up, but it is hard to find anyone whose achievements compare to Hamilton&apos;s. You might say he was lucky to start his F1 career with a dominant team like McLaren, but his records (most wins in a debut season, most consecutive podiums from debut race, most pole positions in a debut season, and on and on) indicate that luck has only played a small part in his ascent. &quot;I&apos;ve had a very different career to a lot of people, where I&apos;ve pretty much won everything, and that&apos;s been my goal,&quot; he says. &quot;Some people have got to where I am and they are great drivers but they haven&apos;t won every class they&apos;ve been in. I just never stopped. I&apos;ve got to win everything.&quot; So how do you explain this season? Hamilton has not suddenly lost his nerve or his desire - ironically, Button believes that Hamilton has driven better this year than he did for some of 2008. So the real question is how McLaren has gone from a position of utter dominance to producing a car that drives like a tractor. In football terms, it would be like Manchester United being thrashed by Burnley and then having to fight off relegation. The answer can be found deep in the messy world of Formula One technology and politics.  The 2009 season began with the most drastic overhaul of the technical regulations for more than two decades. There were three main targets: improve safety, reduce costs and increase overtaking. The last of these initiatives, introduced to make the sport more exciting, has not worked exactly as planned. They might look the same to the casual observer, but the cars that took the grid in Australia in March were massively pared-down from the previous year, with various aerodynamic winglets, chimneys, barge boards and bull horns banned. Without these, it was hoped, cars would be able to slipstream and pass more easily. However, some of the teams found an ingenious way to prevent this, slapping a diffuser on the back and thus channelling the air flow, notably Jenson Button&apos;s Brawn.  And notably not McLaren-Mercedes and Ferrari. The two traditional powerhouses of the sport pinned their hopes on a power-boost system called KERS (kinetic energy retention system). This gives you a powerful burst of acceleration, particularly off the start line, although gains are offset by the extra weight the car is carrying, and most believe that the expensive experiment will be scrapped for future seasons.  In previous years, such miscalculations would have been significant but not season-derailing. The big teams, which had budgets of $500m and a staff of around 2,200, would simply test and test until they found the solution. But this was now forbidden. There are, give or take, 11,500 components on a Formula One car, and McLaren estimates that over the course of a year they will change and improve 75% of these (that&apos;s an upgrade every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day). The place where traditionally much of the work is done is the wind tunnel, which resembles a huge snaking accordion in the guts of McLaren HQ in Woking. In previous years, this facility has run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using more power than the entire town centre, but as part of the agreement to make the sport more sustainable, teams agreed to drastically reduce its use. All the while, a season that had started off badly for McLaren was getting worse, reaching a nadir at the British grand prix in June, where Hamilton qualified in 18th place and finished 16th. &quot;Silverstone was really the pits for us,&quot; admits McLaren Racing&apos;s managing director Jonathan Neale. &quot;The front of our car wasn&apos;t working properly and we hadn&apos;t had a bold attempt at the diffuser. You are trying to tell the drivers, &apos;Hang in there, have patience.&apos; But the pressure was obviously mounting on Lewis exponentially race by race.&quot; Just as Hamilton was dealing with his new-found vulnerability on the track, he was also embroiled in his first real scandal: the controversy that saw him forfeit third place in the Australian grand prix for giving incorrect information (OK, lying) to race stewards. The details of his misdemeanour are intricate and not immediately career-threatening - &quot;it basically amounts to diving in the box to get your team a penalty,&quot; explains Ted Kravitz - but more damaging was the implication that he would do whatever it takes to get ahead. It was also another black mark against a McLaren team that had been fined \u00a350m and stripped of their constructors&apos; points in 2007 for being caught with Ferrari documents.  For Kravitz, there has been no lasting stain on Hamilton&apos;s reputation, but he speculates that he might be much less trusting of McLaren in the future. &quot;Anthony will always look out for Lewis&apos;s best interests,&quot; he says. &quot;Based on what happened in Australia, you can&apos;t say the same for McLaren. McLaren will always put the McLaren racing team first; no one is bigger than the team, as you would expect.&quot; Hamilton, for his part, remains steadfastly committed to the team that has supported him for more than a decade now. When he took the flag in Hungary, he delivered an emotional message of thanks for the relentless work that had been done to get his car up to speed (in contrast to Button, who finished in seventh and bemoaned the fact that his car was &quot;so bad&quot;).  &quot;I can&apos;t explain to you how hard it&apos;s been,&quot; says Hamilton, his voice trailing off. &quot;It&apos;s been the hardest year of my life. It eats you away when you know you can do it but you can&apos;t do it. But the team spirit is incredible at McLaren. We have gone through a lot in three years, more than any other team has experienced, I believe, and we&apos;ve pulled through and we&apos;ve still come out smiling. That&apos;s why I believe we are one of the strongest teams ever.&quot; The interview completed, Hamilton adopts a slightly more relaxed demeanour as The Observer photo shoot progresses. He had asked not to discuss his girlfriend, head Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, in our conversation, but he stops short of denying her existence entirely. When the photographer asks him to stand in profile, he tells him that Nicole prefers to be photographed from one side (her left, research suggests), but then says sweetly, &quot;I think she looks pretty good from every angle.&quot; He wants to know who has seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - &quot;freakin&apos; awesome. I think it&apos;s my favourite ever film&quot; - and also offers that - WORLD EXCLUSIVE! - his favourite Pussycat Dolls dance routine is &quot;Jai Ho!&quot; (You Are My Destiny). A bizarre exchange follows, which segues into him throwing down some impressive robotics before boasting, &quot;Oh, I can definitely dance.&quot; Hamilton certainly has confidence, but despite spending three hours in his presence, it is hard to offer any real insight into what he is like as a person. When the tape recorder is on, he is the consummate professional: smart, polite and focused, purposefully uncontroversial. And this makes good sense. He is absolutely committed to his driving, anything else is a distraction. Away from the media, however, his personality is sure to have been shaped by the single-minded way he has lived his life since he was seven years old. Now 24, and achieving the success he dreamt of, he is probably trying to work out what he is really like too. When I ask him if the dreams he had of F1 stardom live up to the reality, he seems conflicted. &quot;They definitely live up to it,&quot; he says. &quot;Naturally, you miss certain things, such as being able to walk down the street and go to McDonald&apos;s or KFC, or go and meet friends and play football in Hyde Park, those normal everyday things that people get to do. But then there&apos;s a lot of positives you get to enjoy even more.&quot; Today, his thoughts usually gravitate back to his family. He has admitted being lonely in Switzerland, where he spends most of his days training, eating and sleeping. He reveals that he has only just had his first guests to stay, after two and a half years. &quot;I cook a good pasta bake... spaghetti Bolognese... pasta with chicken,&quot; he says. So a fair bit of pasta then. &quot;Yeah. To be honest, most of the time I go round to eat with Mansour [Ojjeh, part-owner of McLaren] who lives nearby.&quot; Nevertheless, the independence has been important. &quot;I miss my family always, but I&apos;m a man now, I take care of myself, I pay my own way, I look after my family,&quot; he says with pride. &quot;You have some people who are happy being told what to do and some people who like to find out for themselves. I&apos;m one of those spirits where if it&apos;s a mistake, I want to feel it myself, I want to find my own way.&quot; That said, nothing beats going home and taking his half-brother down on the computer, or watching him behind the wheel of a car. &quot;He&apos;s a good driver, actually,&quot; says Hamilton. &quot;The problem is that he has fear. You can&apos;t have any fear.&quot;  This is a revealing comment that gets to the nub of why the best drivers are still so valuable in Formula One (Hamilton&apos;s salary is \u00a310m a year). You might need some luck to have a car that has the capability of winning the world title, but it requires something extra-special to take it all the way. On some level, you need to feel immortal. The fine line between the best and the rest is acknowledged eloquently by David Coulthard, who retired last year after 15 seasons in Formula One with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull. &quot;I was given world championship-winning cars, I didn&apos;t win the world championship; there&apos;s a connection,&quot; he said recently. &quot;You know? Good, not good enough.&quot; We will find out soon enough whether Button has the ruthlessness to keep on winning. Despite having been a front-runner for the last two seasons, Hamilton declines to offer advice on how he might approach it. &quot;Jenson is a winner,&quot; he says, &quot;and he&apos;s got a lot more experience than me, he&apos;s older than me, it would be wrong for me to try to give advice. To become a world champion, he needs to find that out for himself.&quot; As for the rest of the season, Hamilton is confident he can build on the quantum leap McLaren made in Hungary. He now stands on 19 points, with Button far off in the distance on 70. Still, McLaren engineers have prepared an upgrade package for the car for Valencia today, with further improvements for Spa-Francorchamps and Singapore next month. &quot;We&apos;ve got to win every race,&quot; says Hamilton simply.  It suddenly becomes clear that - even with 51 points to make up in just seven races - Hamilton still believes he can retain his world championship. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; he says, with quiet determination. &quot;I never give up.&quot; \u2022 Tim Lewis is the editor of Observer Sport Monthly"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/24/malaysia-woman-cane-beer-freed", "sentences": ["Shukarno, a mother of two who had been working as a nurse in Singapore until her case was made public, was being driven from her father&apos;s house in the northern Perak state to a prison near Kuala Lumpur to receive her punishment when she was abruptly driven back home and released."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-24T10:46:55Z", "title": "Malaysia delays caning woman caught drinking beer", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Islam", "World news"], "article": "A Malaysian woman who was due to be caned for drinking beer was today set free by religious authorities, but could still face the punishment after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. A sharia court in the eastern state of Pahang had sentenced Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, 32, to six strokes of the cane after she was caught drinking alcohol at a hotel lounge in December 2007. If the sentence is carried out, she will become the first Malaysian woman to be caned, a move that would heighten fears that the moderate Islamic state \u2013 where Malay Muslims make up about 60% of the population \u2013 is taking a harder line in a battle for votes with an opposition Islamic party. An official said that Shukarno would still be caned, but that the attorney general&apos;s office had advised that the punishment be delayed until after Ramadan \u2013 a period of fasting and prayer \u2013 for &quot;compassionate reasons.&quot; &quot;The sentence is not being cancelled,&quot; Mohamad Sahfri Abdul Aziz, a state legislator in charge of religious affairs, told the Associated Press. Shukarno, a mother of two who had been working as a nurse in Singapore until her case was made public, was being driven from her father&apos;s house in the northern Perak state to a prison near Kuala Lumpur to receive her punishment when she was abruptly driven back home and released. Initially, she refused to get out of the van until her release had been confirmed in writing. &quot;I will not come out without a black and white document explaining the status of what has happened. I am surprised and speechless,&quot; she told reporters. Her father, Abdul Mutalib Shukarno, who persuaded her to leave the vehicle, said the authorities&apos; change of heart risked exposing Islam to ridicule. &quot;My daughter wants the sentence to be done,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m afraid that people will make fun of the religion. Don&apos;t make my daughter a toy to play with.&quot; Shukarno&apos;s case attracted international attention after she asked for the punishment to be carried out in public, a request that may have embarrassed officials into postponing the caning. The part-time model said she respected sharia law, which forbids alcohol consumption by Muslims, and distanced herself from calls by Amnesty International for the sentence to be commuted. Drinking alcohol \u2013 which is legal among Malaysia&apos;s non-Muslim minorities \u2013 is punishable by caning and up to three years in prison, although most offenders escape with a fine. Men sent to prison for more serious crimes, including rape, are caned on their bare buttocks and left permanently scarred. The authorities had said Shukarno would remain fully clothed during her punishment, which would be carried out with a lighter, smaller cane than the one used for men."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/aug/24/cabinet-secretaries-michael-white", "sentences": ["Lester, himself a Lib Dem peer who fell out with Jack Straw this year, likens New Labour&apos;s victory to Singapore, a state which has eliminated the opposition and is already &quot;building an autocracy&quot; \u2013 a shallow judgment worthy of a columnist."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-24T11:43:49Z", "title": "Brave former cabinet secretaries speak out against a government on its last legs | Michael White", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Civil service", "Labour", "Politics past", "Gordon Brown", "Tony Blair"], "article": "Say what you like about those ex-cabinet secretaries, they know when to speak out bravely against a government that is exceeding its historic powers, when it&apos;s on its last legs and they are all safely retired to the boardrooms and Oxbridge colleges where they can eke out their inflation-linked pensions in comfort. What an unkind sentence, Mike, as well as being too long. I know, I know. But Nicholas Watt&apos;s excellent Guardian front page lead this morning is the kind of piece which has that effect on me. If you missed it, what Watt&apos;s story said was that Labour has abandoned cabinet government and increasingly bypassed civil servants during its 12 years in power. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s true, also sure that the same charges were made against previous prime ministers, notably Margaret Thatcher. &quot;Presidential&quot; is the charge they used. They used it against Harold Wilson too. Lords Turnbull, Wilson, Butler and Armstrong, are the mandarins who delivered this verdict in evidence sessions and a memo to the House of Lords constitution committee. They did so in July, but no one saw fit to draw the media&apos;s attention to their thoughts. I have met them all over the years and can even claim to know one or two of them, albeit slightly. Senior civil servants do not get to the top of Whitehall&apos;s greasy pole by befriending the hacks, especially those \u2013 there are some \u2013 not already predisposed to adore them for the nobility of their calling. Nice chaps all, though with the possible exception of Lord Armstrong (cabinet secretary from 1979-87) I rarely felt myself in the presence of greatness, the kind of charisma which some great public servants once exuded. The current occupant of the post, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell, is modest to a fault and would shy away from any such label. What I do on these occasions is turn up the memoirs or, in this instance, Hugo Young&apos;s Diaries (\u00a330, Allen Lane 2008), to see what was said at the time. Particularly relevant seems to be the barrister Anthony Lester&apos;s remarks to Hugo on 12 October 1997. Lester, himself a Lib Dem peer who fell out with Jack Straw this year, likens New Labour&apos;s victory to Singapore, a state which has eliminated the opposition and is already &quot;building an autocracy&quot; \u2013 a shallow judgment worthy of a columnist. But it is cabinet secretary Butler&apos;s version (according to the noble lord and QC) that is worth recording here. No talk of autocracy from him, the new system is (reportedly) &quot;wonderful&quot;, government by concentric circles in which Lord (Derry) Irvine, Blair&apos;s old boss whom he made lord chancellor, and Peter Mandelson are &quot;the only ones that count&quot;. They are both clever \u2013 a delight. &quot;Butler also says that the cabinet committee system is a dead duck. Forget all that .... It is all run by the innermost circle. Ministers do not count for very much at all. Irvine in particular gets it all done \u2026 &quot; etc etc. With hindsight (indeed without it) this is mostly tosh too, not least because it makes no mention of one minister who has no intention of not counting \u2013 quite the opposite. Gordon Brown staged a coup of his own against Treasury officials \u2013 replacing the permanent secretary with one more to his liking (Turnbull) \u2013 and waging war against No 10. Thatcher sacked her cabinet secretary too, by the way. Only after retirement did Turnbull accuse Brown of &quot;Stalinist ruthlessness&quot;. As a footnote to the Lester diary note, Young adds his own note, which is closer to the mark: to the effect that &quot;this government is despising the civil service because they see it as part of the Tory disaster \u2026 yet the civil service were overjoyed when Labour won \u2026 And Labour will need the civil service \u2026 when things get tough. It is very ill-advised.&quot; It&apos;s all history now, but worth noting. Early in Young&apos;s memoirs he notes that Robert Armstrong is cleverer than his rival, John Hunt \u2013 &quot;a ruthless and devious man&quot;. Armstrong is less devious and gains his way &quot;by sheer efficiency and intellectual power. Of course all civil servants at the top are discreet and devious \u2026 &quot; Sir Richard Wilson got the top job after Butler was eased out of No 10 in 1998 as a moderniser who would go along with No 10&apos;s plans to streamline Whitehall \u2013 replace &quot;feudal ministerial baronies with a Napoleonic system&quot;, as I recall Jonathan Powell, Blair&apos;s ex-FCO chief of staff boasting at the time. Wilson rapidly disappointed them by dragging his feet. By 2000 he is telling Hugo Young that Whitehall is no longer the sole source of policy advice \u2013 as it was in his youth \u2013 but also that the creation of a prime minister&apos;s department would have a bad effect on the &quot;independent power and accountability of secretaries of state&quot;. This was sensible and has proved to be the case. But, as usual, right is not all on one side. Labour in 1997 was disappointed with the civil service \u2013 friends on the inside have told me so. But they have also told me that cabinet secretaries such as Andrew Turnbull were sidelined to a surprising degree \u2013 so their attack on &quot;sofa government&quot; (Lord Butler made it in his Iraq war inquiry) may contain an element of pique. By chance I was reading Ferdinand Mount&apos;s entertaining memoir Cold Cream (\u00a320, Bloomsbury, 2008) over the summer. Mount&apos;s background is poor-but-posh, which gives him many insights into policy. It was as a good speechwriter and columnist, however, that he was recruited to run Thatcher&apos;s policy unit at No 10 \u2013 despite being a notorious moderate. He tells similar tales of defeatist civil servants and hopeless ministers. Though never a Thatcherite, he came to admire the Lady&apos;s courage and zeal, seeking to save Britain from terminal rot by sheer force of conviction. I sense it was this can-do attitude that Tony Blair inherited and tried to copy \u2013 in contrast to the consensual drift under nice John Major. The point is that, yes, the civil service mandarins make excellent points at Labour&apos;s expense \u2013 just as the tide of public sentiment is running strongly the Tories way \u2013 but there is also a good case against them and their cautious, self-serving ways. Elected ministers feel the voters&apos; wrath against failure more sharply than officials ever do \u2013 even now when they are slowly being dragged into the daylight to give a better account of themselves."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/25/ben-bernanke-federal-reserve-obama", "sentences": ["&quot;A change in leadership at this time will only add more uncertainty to the outlook right now,&quot; said David Cohen of Action Economics in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-25T08:06:50Z", "title": "Obama to nominate Ben Bernanke for second Fed term", "tags": ["Ben Bernanke", "US economy", "US news", "Business", "Barack Obama", "Economics"], "article": "US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke will be nominated for a second term by Barack Obama later today. The move was welcomed by analysts who said it would provide stability at a critical time for the economy, ending any lingering concerns about who will lead America&apos;s central bank. Obama will interrupt his holiday in Martha&apos;s Vineyard, Massachusetts, to make the announcement with Bernanke at his side at 9am local time (2pm BST). &quot;Ben approached a financial system on the verge of collapse with calm and wisdom; with bold action and outside-the-box thinking that has helped put the brakes on our economic freefall,&quot; the US president will say. &quot;Taken together, all of these steps have brought our economy back from the brink. They are steps that are working.&quot; Bernanke&apos;s appointment to a new four-year term must be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Obama&apos;s Democrats. An expert on the Great Depression, he has lowered US interest rates to near zero and pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy to lift it out of its deepest downturn since the 1930s. The recession now appears close to an end, but economic recovery is fragile, with unemployment and home foreclosures still rising. &quot;It&apos;s very smart; it will be encouraging for the market,&quot; said Jim Awad of Zephyr Management in New York. &quot;He&apos;s viewed very positively \u2013 he saved us from depression and the economy is recovering. The White House has been shrewd in reappointing him to retain confidence in the recovery of the economy and financial markets.&quot; Christopher Dodd, who chairs the Senate banking committee, agreed. &quot;While I have had serious differences with the Federal Reserve over the past few years, I think reappointing chairman Bernanke is probably the right choice,&quot; he said. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said there would be a &quot;thorough and comprehensive&quot; hearing to consider the nomination. Bernanke, 55, was appointed by former president George Bush to succeed Alan Greenspan when he stepped down in January 2006. Bernanke&apos;s current term expires at the end of January. His reappointment was widely expected, although an announcement was not expected until later this year. &quot;A change in leadership at this time will only add more uncertainty to the outlook right now,&quot; said David Cohen of Action Economics in Singapore. &quot;So the market will probably be comfortable with chairman Bernanke continuing in the role; that basically will help support the increased optimism that we have seen around the world in recent months.&quot; Bernanke, a former Princeton University professor, introduced a host of innovative measures to unfreeze credit markets and prevent the collapse of the financial system. He now faces the tough task of unwinding this unprecedented stimulus, which threatens future inflation. &quot;Agree or not, the types of applications and the size of the Fed&apos;s intervention are now established in the annals of Fed policymaking as one of the most dramatic responses ever,&quot; said David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors in New Jersey. The Fed stepped in to rescue failing financial institutions such as insurer AIG, but investment bank Bear Stearns still collapsed. It let Lehman Brothers go under in September 2008 \u2013 the beginning of the worst phase of the financial crisis. Bernanke has said the Fed had no choice given Lehman&apos;s lack of adequate collateral for a loan. While largely praised for his decisive actions, Bernanke has also faced criticism for being slow to cut interest rates when the economy started to worsen two years ago, and for failing to spot the housing bubble earlier in the decade.

Nicky Gumbel: I&apos;m Nicky Gumbel and I&apos;m the vicar of Holy Trinity Brompton. AR: The Reverend Nicky Gumbel and the founder, well not the founder, but the architect of the Alpha course \u2026 Would you say that was accurate? NG: Well, some might say the pioneer of Alpha ... that&apos;s how they sometimes describe me. I didn&apos;t start it. It started in 1977. Charles Marnham was the Curate. It started in the flat just over there, and they had six people on it and it grew from there. Lots and lots of people have been involved in the evolution of Alpha over the years. AR: I appreciate that. Ok, just to get some background, tell me about the origins of Alpha in the 70s first, but also your role in taking over its running. NG: Well I was involved gently in the 70s because I was a member of the congregation here from 1976. It started in 1977 in a flat here. It was a six week course for people who were already Christians. And then, in 1981, it was taken on by someone called John Irvine, who was a Curate here, and he developed it into a ten week course with a weekend, and that really changed the nature of the course quite a lot, and it started to grow quite rapidly. Then John Irvine ran it from &apos;81 to &apos;85 and Nicky Lee took it on from &apos;85 to 1990, and I took it on in 1990. It was already a thriving course, and I did very little to it really except to make it slightly more aimed at people outside the Church, so that was when it really began, numbers wise, to grow. AR: So, in its first inception in the 70s, you say it was for people who were already Christians. What&apos;s the goal if people are already Christians? NG: It was the basics of Christianity really; it was designed for people who had become Christians. It was only six weeks \u2026 I don&apos;t know what the talks were. I have seen the original syllabus, but it was probably something about the Bible and something about prayer, and something about the Church. They had a different course for people who were enquiring in those days. AR: And when you took over in 1990\u2026 NG: It was October 1990. I did the talks when Nicky was leaving, but I actually took over the leadership of it in 1990. AR: And how did the agenda change when you took over? NG: It didn&apos;t change a huge amount. What I found was we were getting a lot of people coming who were not Christians, and I realised then that it could be adapted a bit for them, because they had rather different questions from the people who were already Christians. So, we started to adapt it, but we didn&apos;t do too much to it, so we left it pretty well as it was, because it seemed to be working - that was the point. It wasn&apos;t what you would have designed as a course for people who weren&apos;t Christians. I mean, there&apos;s no way you&apos;d have put those talks in that were in there. The kind of courses we had for people who weren&apos;t Christians were, &apos;Why does God allow suffering?&apos;, &apos;Are all religions the same?&apos;, &apos;Is there evidence for the resurrection?&apos; \u2026 so, we had this course that was designed for Christians, that seemed to work for people who weren&apos;t. So it was that which surprised us. AR: When you say work \u2026 NG: Well, people seemed to want to come on it, people seemed to enjoy it and, actually, some people found faith on it \u2026 and then they brought their friends. So there was clearly something happening through the course. AR: So what do you attribute the success of the course and the expansion since the 90s to? What is it that gets those people interested? NG: The interesting thing is that we didn&apos;t sit down to write something. I sort of stumbled on it, and I found this thing that, as I say, had this appeal to people outside of the Church, and we&apos;ve been trying to work out why this is ever since. It&apos;s the opposite way round to the normal thing: you have a theory, try it out and it works in practice. We&apos;ve got something that works in practice, and we&apos;re trying to work out how we can make it work in theory. So, why is it? I think there are a number of things about it. I think it&apos;s a low key, relaxed, unthreatening, non-confrontational way for people to explore pretty big questions. I think a lot of people do have questions about life, &apos;What&apos;s the purpose of my life?&apos;, &apos;What&apos;s the meaning of my life?&apos;, &apos;Why am I here?&apos; \u2026 It&apos;s hard to find a place where you can discuss those issues. You can&apos;t go down to the pub and say, &apos;What do you think the meaning of life is?&apos; It&apos;s hard at a football match to discuss those kinds of issues. But actually, most people have those questions, somewhere in the back of their minds. And if you can find a place where you can discuss it with a group of people who, like you, are outside of the Church, and it&apos;s a non-threatening, relaxed environment, quite a lot of people want to do that. AR: And what sort of demographic do you see? Because some critics and some supporters talk about it appealing to a very middle-class, very white, relatively affluent and relatively young group of people and, certainly on my course, that was exactly what I saw. I think I was the oldest, bar one, and I&apos;m 34. NG: That&apos;s very encouraging. Well, you did it in Islington, so I guess that is Islington isn&apos;t it? If you do it in Brixton prison it&apos;ll be a different group of people. If you do it in Burundi it&apos;ll be very different. Alpha&apos;s operating in 169 countries, so it&apos;s operating in every culture; in China, rural India, right across the globe. AR: But initially it grew in London, in that demographic I&apos;ve just tried to describe. Is that right? NG: Yes, although I would say that one of the things that helped it was the fact that this is quite a cosmopolitan congregation here. We&apos;ve just done our survey and, for example, at our 11.30 service, there are more non-white than white in that congregation. 36% of our congregation are non-white, 10% are Chinese \u2026 Being in the centre of London we get a lot of people, we get a lot of Americans; we get a lot of Malaysians\u2026 AR: Has it always been like that or is that a result of Alpha&apos;s success? NG: A little bit of that, but this part of London is very cosmopolitan. You&apos;ve got Imperial College; you&apos;ve got students from all over the world. So I think the crucible out of which Alpha came was quite a cosmopolitan one. We always looked out on a room that had quite a variety of people in it, and I think that&apos;s helped form something that can be transported to Asia, South America, the US, India and all these other places. AR: So, in its inception, the term, I don&apos;t know if you actually use it, but many people talk about &apos;de-churched people&apos;\u2026 people who, like me, come from a Christian cultural background, who maybe went to a Christian school, or have Christianity within their family, but are no longer churchgoers; these people may consider themselves to be Christians or, like me, atheists, but they have an understanding of who Jesus was and how Christianity basically works. So how is it that Alpha really capitalises on that demographic? NG: I think what tends to happen is the course is representative of the area. So, for instance, most people who live in Islington are probably what you&apos;ve just described as de-churched. But in China, most of the people who come on the course might be atheist. At a conference we did in Singapore, most of them described themselves as &apos;free-thinkers&apos; beforehand. In different parts of the world there are different backgrounds. When we looked at the analysis of our own course here I think it was pretty representative of what the population at large is. I think 75% of the population of this country are probably still de-churched. It&apos;s the younger end, the 25%, the merging generation, who have no church background at all. AR: So the &apos;un-churched&apos;? NG: Yes, if you turn that category de-churched in to the un-churched, I would say the make-up of Alpha here is probably like that: 75% are un-churched. AR: What do you think the aspect of un-churched people is, if we can use that term? What is missing, or what are the questions that they don&apos;t have answers to, which Alpha attempts to address? NG: It&apos;s very interesting because the un-churched are the new people coming in. The younger end tend to be the un-churched, the ones who&apos;ve got no baggage at all. And in a sense they come at it with a great advantage, in some ways. AR: What sort of baggage are you talking about? NG: Well, experience of thinking of Christianity as boring, for example, because they&apos;ve got no experience at all of Christianity. If you&apos;ve had an experience where you&apos;ve been at school or you&apos;ve been involved in services and you&apos;ve thought, &apos;That&apos;s so dull,&apos; yes, you&apos;ve got some information but also it&apos;s something that may have put you off, whereas if you haven&apos;t got that experience at all you come to it with completely fresh eyes. So there&apos;s a mixture of people, and there are advantages and disadvantages in both of those. AR: The way you&apos;re talking about it, although the goal, officially, as you said at the beginning, is a method to explore Christianity in a relaxed and informal setting (and it certainly was all of those things where I did it), surely the goal as an evangelical is to convert agnostics to Christianity? NG: This may sound pernickety but I wouldn&apos;t describe myself as an evangelical. These are labels, which I don&apos;t think are helpful. If I was going to use any label it would be Christian, and if you push me any further I&apos;d say I&apos;m an Anglican - that&apos;s the family of the Church that I belong to. There&apos;s nothing wrong with any of the other labels, but if you have any of them I want them all. If you&apos;re going to say, &apos;I&apos;m Catholic, liberal, evangelical\u2026&apos; let&apos;s have them all. But I wouldn&apos;t want to isolate one of those. Personally I think labels are terribly unhelpful because they enable you to dismiss things. But, your main question is the purpose of the course. The purpose of the course is to give as many people as possible the opportunity to explore these things. I was an atheist and I came to experience a relationship with God which had a radically transforming effect on my life, on my relationships, on every aspect of my life, for the better. So, obviously I hope other people will experience that. But it&apos;s very important to me that they have a sense of freedom while they&apos;re doing the course and they don&apos;t feel in any way pressurised in to it. They&apos;re free to come and go as they please, they can explore it in a relaxed way. Obviously I&apos;m disappointed that a lot of people end the course as atheists. I&apos;d love it if that wasn&apos;t the case, in some ways. But in another sense I find it very reassuring that they do, because it means that they can enjoy the course and not feel any pressure to convert. They feel free to make up their own mind, and that is a very important part of it. AR: Let&apos;s talk about the labels point that you were just making, which I think is very interesting. You&apos;re not the first clergyman to resist those definitions, and yet from an outsider, from my point of view as an atheist, you see labels and boundaries and definitions throughout, not just in Christianity, but in all religions. NG: The only label I would choose for myself is Christian, but if you pushed me and you say, &apos;What sort of Christian are you?&apos; I&apos;m an Anglican. AR: There&apos;s an important point that underlies this which relates directly to how Alpha works, and I don&apos;t know whether you&apos;re happy with this definition but I see it as a sort of &apos;franchise&apos;. It&apos;s become such a global phenomenon; you said that it&apos;s been translated in to how many languages..? NG: It&apos;s in 169 countries and it&apos;s been translated in to 100 languages. AR: But the course has a curriculum and, as far as I can tell, the diversity of how that curriculum is interpreted is astonishing. And if I&apos;d taken the Alpha course two miles up the road in Hackney where I live rather than in Islington which is on my way home, then I get the impression that I would have had a massively different experience. So how does the diversity amongst the different denominations affect what is actually taught? NG: The diversity amongst the denominations is not so great because the course is the same. It&apos;s the same in the Roman Catholic Church as in the Anglican, as in the Salvation Army. That&apos;s one of the things that had to happen over the years, as it moved. 1966 was the first conference for Roman Catholic clergy. There were very minor adaptations, but there were some things that we needed to just adapt, and things we learnt, actually, through our interaction with the Catholic Church. AR: Let me pick you up on that. I think what you&apos;ve just said can&apos;t be true because if you take a Pentecostal church where there is a heavily charismatic bent, where they actively encourage the traits of charismatic Christianity, such as speaking in tongues and healing, that is massively different to what happens in a very straight Anglican church such as St. Mary&apos;s in Islington, although I do know that Graham Kings and Toby Hole there do talk in tongues when they&apos;re praying. Now, that didn&apos;t happen on our course and it wasn&apos;t actively encouraged. But if I&apos;d gone to a Pentecostal church or if I&apos;d come here, the atmosphere to encourage glossolalia would have been far stronger, presumably? NG: I don&apos;t know. Probably one of the strongest movements of the Holy Spirit is in the Roman Catholic Church, so there&apos;s not a huge theological difference between the official teaching of the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church, for example. AR: I come from a Catholic church, although I&apos;m an atheist, and Father Leader would think that speaking tongues is the stuff of Ju Ju madmen. NG: Well I don&apos;t know whether he thinks that, but the Catechism that is up there [on the bookshelf] does not say that, nor do many, many Catholics around the world. The Pentecostal movement is strongest in the Catholic Church, and I think there are 110 million Catholics, at least, around the world who do have some experience along those lines that you&apos;ve just described. AR: I wasn&apos;t planning to talk about speaking in tongues until a bit later, but let&apos;s do it while we&apos;re on it. How important is it to Alpha, relative to how important it is in Christianity as a whole? NG: I would say it&apos;s about the same. It&apos;s not that important, but it&apos;s there. If you read the New Testament it&apos;s not that important, but it is there. It was part of the course that I inherited, and I basically left it there. I personally think it was in the providence of God that it was there. What I see is that some people find it very difficult. On the other hand I think that when people experience something that seems to be supernatural, in some ways it cuts through the secular mindset. AR: What do you mean by &apos;seems to be supernatural&apos;? NG: Well I think it is a supernatural activity, and people see that. AR: What do you think is going on when that happens to you? NG: I think it&apos;s a form of prayer which comes from the Holy Spirit, and it&apos;s there in the Book of Acts and there in the history of the Church. I can give you a book by the preacher to the Pope, where he talks about this experience. It&apos;s something that he&apos;s experienced himself, and it&apos;s common throughout the different parts of the Church. It&apos;s not a huge emphasis in the New Testament, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a huge emphasis on Alpha. I hope it&apos;s not a huge emphasis on Alpha, because it shouldn&apos;t be. AR: It is one of the aspects that critics of Alpha tend to focus on, on the grounds that it does feel very alien to people who don&apos;t participate, or can&apos;t. Certainly there is plenty of scientific evidence on what&apos;s going on. Often the distinction between what happens in patients with mental illness and what happens in patients going through glossolalia looks very similar. But you actually believe there is a supernatural mechanism at play here, rather than a manifestation of something biological? NG: Yes, I think it&apos;s one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. It&apos;s not the only gift and it&apos;s not right at the heart of the New Testament, but it is there, and I think we don&apos;t give it much more emphasis than the New Testament gives it, which is not very much. If you came to our weekend and heard it I don&apos;t think you would feel this is something that is weird. AR: Well I&apos;ve watched loads of videos of it happening and I do think it&apos;s very weird. NG: Most people who make a video make something to look weird. If you came along on one of the weekends that we have and you saw it \u2026 Most people&apos;s reaction to it is, &apos;That was very beautiful&apos;. Often they have quite a lot of concerns beforehand, because they&apos;ve heard all sorts of things, then they hear it and think it was very beautiful and very peaceful. It may or may not be for them, and it doesn&apos;t really matter whether it is or not. I have no idea how many people who help or lead on Alpha have that gift or not and it really doesn&apos;t worry me whether they do or don&apos;t. AR: So there were a couple of questions about speaking in tongues from people commenting on the first piece that I wrote. So, one was, &apos;When you&apos;re speaking in tongues, why is it that nonsense syllables are all formed with perfect English pronunciation?&apos; NG: I don&apos;t think that is the case actually. AR: It is, in fact, and looking at the scientific research, no matter which country you&apos;re from you see the same vocal patterns as your natural language. NG: Hang on a second, is that really the case? AR: That&apos;s the research I&apos;ve come across.Rebecca Stewart [HTB staff, sitting in on the interview]: My husband Alex was praying for someone very quietly in tongues, and he didn&apos;t know what he was saying - it was the spiritual language. But the person he was praying for said to him, &apos;Do you know what you were saying?&apos; and Alex said he didn&apos;t, and he said, &apos;Well you were praying in Arabic, and you were saying &quot;More peace&quot;.&apos; AR: He was actually saying Arabic words?RS: Yes. AR: So that&apos;s a different phenomenon from glossolalia, that&apos;s xenolalia, which is also recognised as a phenomenon, but is equally not understood. This question from one of the [CiF] readers was more an insinuation that one can only adopt what is considered to be speaking in tongues based on one&apos;s own language, and therefore there isn&apos;t something totally supernatural; it is derived from the speech centres in your brain. NG: Well I would say that&apos;s supernatural. There have been several cases of different languages recognised by someone else. That&apos;s been our experience. AR: Another one from the [talk]boards: Does anyone get any special insight in to anything when they&apos;re talking in tongues? NG: It&apos;s a form of prayer, that&apos;s how I see it. In the New Testament it has the same word, there&apos;s not a different word used, because they all understood what was being said and that was the gift. The Greek word is &apos;languages&apos;, &apos;other languages&apos;, that&apos;s the literal translation of the Greek word that&apos;s used both in Acts, where it was the Day of Pentecost, and in One Corinthians, where it&apos;s a gift of the spirit. There does appear to be a slight difference in accent in Corinthians and I think that&apos;s what you&apos;re referring to - Acts where it was clearly understood by the heroes and in Corinthians where interpretation is required. But what Paul is saying in One Corinthians is that it&apos;s a form of prayer and it&apos;s a gift from God which helps you \u2026 I&apos;m trying to explain something to you and I&apos;m struggling to find the words to explain it \u2026 In your relationship with God there are also times when you want to say things and you&apos;re trying to find the words to express them. In a human relationship sometimes you struggle for words and you&apos;ve got to do it, but in a relationship with God he can actually give you a language which enables you to communicate. What&apos;s happening is, it&apos;s all going on in the brain, I know, but I&apos;m trying to express things in a language which is limited by the words that I know. In a relationship with God you feel things and you want to express them and you&apos;re not limited by human language. You can express what you really feel in your heart, through a language that he gives you, and that helps you to communicate with God. It doesn&apos;t really matter so much what the words are I don&apos;t think - maybe if you&apos;re a real expert in prayer you could do it through silence. But I think sometimes it helps to express it and to know you&apos;re expressing it to God. Paul talked about praying with your spirit and that&apos;s basically what it is, it&apos;s expressing what you feel deep down in a language which God gives you. AR: There was a follow on from that which is interesting based on what you just said. This is from someone on the boards as well. How can there be a technique for something that is apparently so spontaneous? NG: I don&apos;t think there is a technique. I think that the gifts of the spirit are always subject to the control of the person who&apos;s exercising them. You&apos;re not forced in to doing it. Love never forces. And therefore &apos;the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet&apos; is another way it is put. You don&apos;t suddenly find yourself taken over by a spirit and find yourself speaking tongues. You&apos;re in control, but it&apos;s a gift. You can stop and start as you please, but it&apos;s a way of communicating with God. AR: I&apos;ve seen videos online, and I again take your point about how videos are edited, but I&apos;ve seen videos in which there looks to me like - and this is very different to what you&apos;re describing now, which is a very personal and acquired thing - but it looks very much to me like mass hysteria, where people are being very vocally hounded in to having experiences which, in opposition to what you just said, they&apos;re not in control at all. I&apos;ve got no idea whether they&apos;re faking, whether they&apos;re just appeasing the crowd or whatever, but that is not what you&apos;ve just described. NG: No, I&apos;ve never seen that. It certainly doesn&apos;t happen on our Alpha course like that. It&apos;s a very peaceful, it&apos;s a very beautiful thing, and for me it&apos;s a personal prayer language that I use in my relationship with God and I think for most people it is. It&apos;s something that helps them. It&apos;s not something I do all the time. There have been moments in my life where it&apos;s been a very helpful gift to me. The moment I heard the news that my mother had had a heart attack, which she died from, I was in the taxi on the way to the hospital and I really wanted to pray and I prayed in tongues. I found that a huge relief because I knew I was praying but I didn&apos;t have to go through trying to work out how I should be praying or what I should be praying, I just prayed. I was just praying quietly in tongues and I found that a really helpful way to pray. There are other times when I use the gift when I really feel I don&apos;t know what to pray or how to pray. I know what I feel but I just can&apos;t quite put it in to words, and I use that, I find it a helpful gift. I don&apos;t think you need to speak in tongues, I don&apos;t think all Christians do speak in tongues, nobody has to speak in tongues, nobody&apos;s forced to, but if somebody wants to I think it&apos;s a good gift. AR: Ok, let&apos;s move on from that. How do you think Alpha is perceived by the General Synod and the rest of organised Christianity? NG: I know it has a lot of support from our bishops. Our own bishop, the bishop of London, has just hosted our International Week. We had 74 archbishops and bishops from around the world and he opened the conference and he&apos;s been one of the initiators. About ten years ago he wrote to all the other bishops in England and said &apos;Do you realise what&apos;s happening here? You ought to investigate for yourself.&apos; I think most bishops now, because they go around doing confirmations, and they see how many people come to be confirmed because they&apos;ve been on an Alpha course, are behind it. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s been criticised. All the bishops that I&apos;ve ever spoken to about it have been enormously supportive of what&apos;s happening here. AR: This week a bishop declared in the Telegraph on Sunday that Christian Britain is dead and multiculturalism and declining church numbers could cause Christianity in Britain to die. NG: [referring to &apos;God is Back&apos; by John Micklethwaite on his bookshelf] That was written by an atheist and a lapsed Catholic. Look around the world - it&apos;s not true. Globally it&apos;s certainly not true, and even in Europe they&apos;re saying it&apos;s not true. AR: So, let me finish that question, which is that a cynic might suggest that the General Synod appreciation for Alpha is simply a response to the fact that it&apos;s one bit of Christian faith that is bucking the trend in the UK and possibly worldwide, but let&apos;s just talk about the UK. If this bishop is correct in saying that Christian Britain will be dead in the next ten years, the only way it&apos;s going to survive is through the one phenomenon which is growing, which is what you&apos;re responsible for. NG: Well I don&apos;t agree with the premise. I think God is back, I think there is a huge amount of spiritual interest in the country. And I think the bishops are supportive of it because they see people&apos;s lives being changed. They see the difference. That&apos;s why I love doing it, because I see people who&apos;ve been in prison, whose lives have been messed up, who&apos;ve been alcoholics, who&apos;ve been drug addicts, set free and contributing to society. AR: Do you think it appeals to people who are vulnerable? NG: I hope it appeals to everyone. In one sense we&apos;re all vulnerable, we&apos;re all weak human beings. But I think it appeals to a very wide range. If you look at the people who come on the course here some of them are immensely successful, they&apos;ve got strong marriages, strong families, very successful careers, but they would still say that there&apos;s something missing \u2013 &quot;I&apos;ve got all this, yet I don&apos;t have an answer to the big questions of life. Why am I here? What&apos;s it all about? Yes, I&apos;m successful, I&apos;m intelligent, educated, I&apos;ve got lots of friends&quot;, but there&apos;s something deep down, which I would describe as a spiritual hunger. They know something&apos;s missing; they know they were created for something more than this. It&apos;s true that in the prisons there is perhaps even a greater openness than elsewhere. In a way in prison you&apos;re stripped of all the things that could be barriers. You don&apos;t have all the money and the success and things that make you think, &apos;Well maybe that&apos;s what life is all about.&apos; and you start to look at the really big questions. But what I see is people&apos;s lives being changed. In our congregation we have 20 people who are ex-offenders and many of them are making a major contribution to the life of the church and to society. They&apos;re people who, instead of going out committing crime they&apos;re helping in a homeless shelter, or they&apos;re serving in some other way, and that to me is a wonderful thing. Their marriages are being restored, they treat their children differently, their children say, &apos;It&apos;s so wonderful to come home and not have my parents fighting or my father drunk \u2013 he&apos;s sober, he cares about me, he loves me, he gives me attention.&apos; AR: Do you think that submission to Christ is the essential step in that process? Isn&apos;t what you&apos;re describing simply trying to be a better person? This may sound kinda ridiculous but vicars love to rely on the petty crook who has &apos;found God and gone good&apos;. NG: Well they&apos;re not just petty crooks. Two guys in our congregation were responsible for the largest importation ever of cannabis in to this country ever. They got twelve and a half years. They were associates of the Kray Brothers, they knew all the Great Train Robbers! Michael Emmett was there last night sitting in the front row of the Church. He is a fantastic guy. The contribution he&apos;s made to the Church in every area of the Church&apos;s life has been fantastic. AR: But conversion to Christianity or any religion within a prison setting is not limited to Alpha. It predates Alpha by a long way\u2026 NG: Of course, yes. I&apos;m not really committed to Alpha at all. I&apos;m a Christian. I&apos;m committed to Jesus Christ and I want people to know about Christ, because it&apos;s the most wonderful thing. People can say, &apos;I&apos;ll try and give up drugs,&apos; or &apos;I&apos;ll try and live a better life,&apos; but actually, if you&apos;re trapped in that lifestyle, you need, I think, some supernatural power to get you out of it. It&apos;s not easy to get out of the kind of lifestyles those people are in where all your family are criminals and all your friends are criminals \u2013 that is not an easy break to make, and it is a hard thing for a lot of these people. AR: Why do you think there&apos;s so much hostility towards religion and, specifically, Christianity, in Britain these days? NG: I don&apos;t know, but I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s any different. If you read the New Testament there was quite a lot of hostility then. They were locked up, they were stoned. I don&apos;t know that it&apos;s any more unpopular than it&apos;s been in the history of the Church. I think it&apos;s just one of those things. AR: I can&apos;t help noticing that the way you&apos;ve sat yourself (we&apos;re in your study), if I just look six inches over your left shoulder I can see The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins sitting quite prominently on your shelf. Do you see any effect of his work and this growing movement of free-thinkers or atheism? NG: I think his writing has had an effect on a group of people. I would say I&apos;ve noticed in the last two or three years that amongst the people coming on Alpha there are some people who have been very influenced by his writings, and who speak the same kind of language, almost the same tone. You almost feel like he&apos;s in the group. It&apos;s a small minority but two or three times in the last couple of years there&apos;s been someone\u2026 AR: What sort of tone is it that you&apos;re experiencing? NG: I think it&apos;s a slightly more hostile approach. We encourage people to be hostile on Alpha. I&apos;m always glad to hear somebody speak like that because that&apos;s what we want. All that I&apos;m saying in terms of its influence is that I can see that it has had an influence on people. (NG hands AR a copy of his book, Is God a Delusion?) AR: You are an incredibly prolific writer. NG: No, no, no, only because it relates to the question. I did find a couple of people who were reading it and thinking, &apos;God has been disproved&apos;. I was just having a go at saying, &apos;I&apos;m not sure that is the case.&apos; AR: Well I don&apos;t think Dawkins does say that, but I don&apos;t want to talk about Dawkins... NG: No no, but that&apos;s my attempt to answer some of the points he makes. AR: One of the things I&apos;ve seen on the course, and from someone I&apos;ve spoken to who says that this contributes to Alpha&apos;s success, is that it engages lay people from the Church, and certainly the two guys who help out in St Mary&apos;s take a very proactive role. I detect a slightly different message. This is not a personal criticism of the person running the course, the Curate, who obviously has an academic background as a biblical scholar and a theologian, and the two helpers who don&apos;t. Now I hear, not a different message, but a very different nuance to the way they&apos;re saying things. The Curate says, and I know he&apos;s holding back, and he&apos;s got an annoying mosquito such as myself pushing him with pretty superficial arguments that you probably come across a million times, I know he&apos;s holding back, otherwise it would just be the two of us talking and it would prevent an open discussion. The two lay guys in the church give far less nuance, far less subtlety and what I describe as the clich\u00e9s of Christianity. Lots of language which I think is largely meaningless to people who are being very critical, and much more dogmatic. When I was asking questions like, &apos;If I live a life in the footsteps of Christ but don&apos;t believe that the resurrection was a real phenomenon, can I get in on judgement day?&apos; Toby [the Curate] says, &apos;I don&apos;t know.&apos; I love that. You never come across religious people who say &apos;I don&apos;t know.&apos; The other two guys, Mike and Bob, say &apos;No&apos;. Now that&apos;s a really interesting phenomenon because you&apos;ve got people with an academic theological background and you&apos;ve got people who are straight up Christians, grassroots Christians, and I detect a dichotomy between those two groups which I think is reflected in Christianity across Britain. NG: Well I would say that&apos;s quite a small sample! I hope you wouldn&apos;t find too dogmatic lay people involved in Alpha generally. I hope most lay people would be willing to say &apos;I don&apos;t know&apos; to those kinds of questions. And I don&apos;t know that most lay people are more dogmatic than clergymen, I think some clergy can be very dogmatic. AR: But I do perceive that distinction between what Rowan Williams says and what Christians across the country think, and this is reflected in questions about how science relates to religion quite often. NG: Well, Rowan is very nuanced, he is brilliant, and I am personally a great fan of Rowan Williams. Jane, his wife, is on our staff here. They both teach at the theological college. I think he&apos;s absolutely brilliant. He is very nuanced, but not everyone can be in the Rowan Williams league - he&apos;s probably one of the greatest brains in the country. The lay people don&apos;t necessarily have the training that the clergy have had \u2013 they&apos;ve had to go through theological college. But I don&apos;t think in terms of being dogmatic \u2013 I think that&apos;s a slightly different thing, I think that&apos;s more of a personality thing probably, whether some person is dogmatic. Some clergy are dogmatic, some lay people are dogmatic, some are not. But part of the training on Alpha is to &apos;listen to people&apos;. I&apos;m glad to hear that the Curate held back, because that is, again, part of the training, because it&apos;s polite, apart from anything, to listen to people.and to hear what they have to say. We get the opportunity to give the talk, the idea for small group is that they get the opportunity to have their say. Apart from anything else it&apos;s just good manners. AR: Your name is totally synonymous with Alpha. I was sent an enormous box of your books [in prep for this interview] NG: I try not to just pile out books. I originally wrote &apos;Questions of Life&apos; because people were saying I wanna run an Alpha Course. That [&apos;Is God a Delusion?&apos;] I wrote cos people were saying what is the answer to Richard Dawkins, has he disproved the existence of God, so I wrote that for our congregation, to help them think through the issues. AR: HTB has huge congregations, doesn&apos;t it? NG: A few people come on Sunday, I dunno, 3500 come on Sunday. AR: That&apos;s big. But I&apos;ve heard that they travel, and they&apos;re coming to see you.  NG: I don&apos;t think they&apos;re coming to see me. AR: My Aunt Ruth from Liverpool has been to see you. She thinks you&apos;re ace. NG: That&apos;s lovely. Send her my love. AR: My Uncle, he thinks your grin too much. You&apos;re obviously very charming and affable, and confident, and I get a tiny sense that there is a bit of cult of personality about Alpha, that you are so much at the centre, whether you like it or not, or whether you&apos;ve engineered it or not, for many people you ARE Alpha.  NG: It&apos;s interesting that the perception. Because if you come here on a Sunday, that&apos;s not what you&apos;d feel. I don&apos;t preach that often, Funnily enough I was preaching yesterday on the cults, how to spot a false prophet. We&apos;re very much a team, there&apos;s a big team here, and it makes no difference at all who&apos;s preach to how many turn up on a Sunday.  AR: Everyone I spoke to in reference to this interview their reaction was &quot;Oh really??&quot; it&apos;s such a phenomenon that people involved see you as a central figure. So what happens next? You&apos;ve said that you&apos;re committed to Christ but not to Alpha. If the unchurched rise, the next generation who don&apos;t know who Jesus was, don&apos;t have a Christian cultural background, who may have learnt comparative religion rather than just Christianity. Will Alpha survive? NG: In France, the DVDs are done by a guy called Marc De la Ritz who is a French Catholic. So if you do Alpha in France he&apos;s the person you relate to, he&apos;s the person on the DVDs. And I hope as it goes on that will happen more and more. Succession is taking place already AR: But do you think that people will be attracted to a course to learn about Jesus, if they don&apos;t know who Jesus was. NG: But in some ways I think that can be an advantage, like fresh snow. You don&apos;t have all the cultural baggage, it was terrible it was dull. Bu the questions are still there &quot;What is the meaning of my life, what is the purpose of my life&quot; AR: It kinda makes it more competitive for other religions, cos you&apos;re now in an open field because Islam, or Buddhism or whatever are all competing for the same fresh blood. NG: But that&apos;s true globally. It&apos;s been less true in the UK up till now, but many countries you go that is tha case, for example in India where Christianity is very much the minority. But still people are asking those questions and Alpha is growing fast in India and elsewhere round the world AR: Cinema ads, TV ads, the DVDs, the books, This is a huge global brand and enterprise. How is it funded? NG: About 10% comes from the sale of books and materials, and the rest is funded by donations. The more Alpha grows, the more money we need to raise. It&apos;s a charity.  AR: So we&apos;re talking large individual donations, or collecting pennies from the congregation NG: It&apos;s a mixture. The congregation is very generous here. In the early years the congregation funded the whole thing. We want it to be free for everyone. No one should be charged for hearing the gospel, that&apos;s a biblical principle. Last year 1.6 million people did it around the world.  AR: Let me pick you up on that. It says on the home page that 2 million people in the UK and 13 million worldwide. Everyone I&apos;ve spoken to who&apos;s done an Alpha says that there people on the course who have done it before. So how many people have really done it? NG: I don&apos;t know, is the answer. I think the global figure is possibly an underestimate, and the UK figure may include some double counting AR: That a tiny bit of a PR fudge there? NG: I don&apos;t know what the figure is in the UK. Our figures are done by an independent organisation called Christian research. Their UK figure would be a bit higher than that, but we&apos;ve stuck with 2 million. I&apos;m very confident about the global figure of 13 million, because we don&apos;t know how many courses there are, because they&apos;re not registered with us. They&apos;re not registered in China for example.  AR: There&apos;s a lot of animosity of Alpha from people who haven&apos;t done it. There&apos;s accusations of cultish-ness and brainwashing. That&apos;s certainly not what I&apos;ve seen, but it&apos;s exacerbated by the speaking in tongues and the charismatic slant. But one thing that keeps coming up from people I&apos;ve spoken to is latent or overt homophobia. What&apos;s your stance on that? NG: I think it&apos;s nonsense. I really do. We welcome everybody regardless of age sex race or sexual orientation. Everyone is welcome to come on Alpha.  AR: I pulled a quote out from you from an earlier interview in which you referred to the Bilbe referring to homosexuality as something that could be healed. Is that your stance? NG: You&apos;ve taken it very out of context of the whole thing. Our stance is this: We have the same attitude towards people. As the old clich\u00e9 goes I&apos;ve got lots of [gay] friends. It&apos;s absurd to suggest that there&apos;s any hostility\u2026 AR: Address the issue of whether the interpretation of the Bible that says that homosexuality is something that can be healed. Is that your stance? NG: We believe that sex is for marriage, and that&apos;s regardless of whether it&apos;s homosexual or hetero sexual. AR: But what you&apos;ve just done is, because we have legal gay unions, but marriage is still the preserve of hetero couples, if sex outside of marriage is a sin, and homosexuals can&apos;t get married, then homosexual sex is a sin.  NG: Our position on this subject is exactly the same as the Anglican Church. Our position on the issue of homosexuality is no different from the position of the Anglican Church and all the major denominations around the world. I know that it&apos;s different from the secular culture in the western world, but it&apos;s no different from the teaching of the church globally. We&apos;re Christians basically. AR: You say that with a liberal hat on, in a congregation which is incredibly diverse in the centre of London. But because Alpha is run as a franchise you prescribe a curriculum, which has charismatic and evangelical elements to it, and is fully open to interpretation by the leader of the course wherever it&apos; being run, to embrace the less acceptable forms of prejudice such as deep rooted homophobia. Now, I&apos;ve come across people who have expressed that within Alpha very specifically, they said they were not welcome at Alpha when they revealed that they were gay. I&apos;ve come across some who&apos;ve said it in much subtler ways, the reference to healing. NG: Where have you come across people not being welcome at Alpha ? AR: By talking to people who&apos;ve done it. NG: And said they weren&apos;t welcome? AR: Yep NG: Which church was this? AR: I can&apos;t say that. NG: Why not? AR: Because that would be revealing who they are. NG: I&apos;m absolutely astonished that anyone would go to a church and not be welcomed because of their sexual orientation. AR: You&apos;d be astonished by that, genuinely? NG: Astonished by any church running Alpha not welcoming people because of their sexual orientation. AR: Really? We could go to a dozen churches with relative ease which were effectively homophobic.  NG: Well I&apos;d be amazed. We welcome people of all orientation. That seems to me to be a fundamental Christian principle. We welcome the guys I told about, the drug importers, that&apos;s what the church is for. AR: I&apos;m just going to push you one more time on this: Can homosexuality be healed? NG: I think everybody needs healing. My understanding of human beings is that we were created in the image of God but we are all fallen, and Jesus died for us so that we can be redeemed. Every Christian is in a process of healing in some way. We&apos;re not as we&apos;re meant to be. God&apos;s original creation was good, and in some ways fallen away from that. And in every area of our life we need to be healed and restored and to become more Christ-like.  AR: What you&apos;ve just said, inadvertently or deliberately I don&apos;t know, is that if you&apos;re taking about a crook, some of the guys who&apos;ve converted via Alpha in your church as you&apos;ve mentioned or someone who has a drug problem which is an obvious and incontrovertible bad thing, in me asking if homosexuality can be healed, you&apos;ve made a comparison between things which are unequivocally bad, and something that I and many people believe is both normal and natural. Clarify that. NG: Well, our position on homosexuality is exactly the same as the rest of the church.  AR: I&apos;m not asking the rest of the church, I&apos;m asking you. NG: All I&apos;m saying is that ours is the same as that. If you want to say something about this issue, you have to say it about the whole of the Christian church&apos;s attitude towards homosexuality. You cannot isolate and say, this is Alpha&apos;s attitude. AR: But I&apos;m asking you: Nicky Gumbel? NG: I&apos;m saying my attitude is the same as the Church&apos;s. But don&apos;t make out that Alpha&apos;s is different form the church cos it isn&apos;t. Our views are exactly the same as the views that I am, in a sense, under authority to have. These are the views of the Anglican Church. And it&apos;s also true of the Catholic Church, the Methodist, the Baptists, every denomination. You won&apos;t find a single historic denomination that doesn&apos;t share this same view. I think it&apos;s unfair to say that Alpha has a different view, because we don&apos;t. AR: But you&apos;re revealing quite a dichotomy about how the franchise works. Because fine that&apos;s your position and I can&apos;t get you to say more than that, clearly. But the franchise is such that it can be operated by many different denominations, and because of the nature of having a course leader and you only exercise a curriculum level control of what&apos;s being taught. You&apos;ve created a highly popular highly successful evangelical movement which is open to interpretation by people whose views are not what you&apos;ve just describe, the same as the church. So the result of that is that I&apos;ve come across people who&apos;ve gone to Alpha and been told that they weren&apos;t welcome. NG: Well I&apos;m very sorry about that. Please pass on my apologies. AR: But much more insidiously people who have been told that it&apos;s fine to be gay, but we can cure you. The implication being that being gay is a disease or something that can be cured. NG: Well we can&apos;t control the way an Alpha course is run, that is true. Nor would we want to. The only way you can do it is to go around policing it, and that&apos;s such a heavy handed thing to do. It&apos;s a gift. We basically say this is something that has blessed our church, if your church wants to run it, here it is. You may be different from us, you&apos;re a RC church, not everything that you teach will be things that we as Anglicans agree with, but we&apos;re not going to come around a police you. So there has to be a freedom, but there&apos;s this element that the course is basically the same. If they choose to join the Catholic Church at the end of the course, that&apos;s wonderful. We have to give people the freedom to do that. The alternative would be far worse, a manipulation and control of the churches that were doing it. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right. I think we have to say it&apos;s up to you. Of course there are going to be courses run badly, and some run very well.  AR: I think the perception of Alpha is skewed by those &apos;rotten apples&apos;, and I see that in the comments. There is a lot of animosity. Most people&apos;s reflection on my saying I&apos;m doing the course was a million miles from what I experienced. NG: I think most people&apos;s criticism comes from people who haven&apos;t done the course. Of course there are some critics who have, but most of the way off criticism is from people who have never done it. And my response is &apos;go and try it, it&apos;s open to everyone to come and see&apos;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/28/mark-webber-red-bull-belgian-grand-prix", "sentences": ["&quot;We expect the Brawns to be quick in Singapore and Abu Dhabi,&quot; said Webber."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-28T20:28:38Z", "title": "Red Bull's Mark Webber desperate to close on 'hunted' Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello", "tags": ["Formula One", "Red Bull", "Brawn", "McLaren", "Renault", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Mark Webber", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Mark Webber believes Sunday&apos;s Belgian grand prix represents one of the few remaining chances for Red Bull to close the gap on Brawn&apos;s Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello.

We need a phenomenal amount of points and a very consistent run, and even then we need to have both of the Brawns to have a rough run [for us] to get to the top of the championship.&quot; Brawn appeared to be in difficulty today on a predominantly fast track that should suit Red Bull but was dominated by Lewis Hamilton&apos;s McLaren. Barrichello and Button were 17th and 18th after spending the dry afternoon practice session attempting to make their cars work as efficiently as the Red Bull through the all-important middle sector of the 4.33-mile (7km) lap. &quot;The morning session was frustrating for everyone because we only got a few laps in before it rained,&quot; said Button. &quot;The afternoon was all about making comparisons with certain new things, including a revised engine cover we&apos;ve brought here. I&apos;m not 100% happy with the car at the moment but I think \u2013 I hope \u2013 things will be sorted tomorrow. &quot;We are not on the pace of Red Bull over one lap but our long runs are OK [once the tyres reach working temperature]. The main thing is the tyres are working here, which has been a problem in the past in cooler conditions.&quot; Barrichello may have had similar problems but enjoyed the psychological advantage of being faster than his team-mate. &quot;We got through a lot of work today which sets the weekend up nicely,&quot; said Barrichello. &quot;There is still some way to go to realise the full potential of the car but, as always on a Friday, the lap times don&apos;t tell the whole story. It was pretty useful to get some wet running in this morning just in case the weather plays a part in qualifying or the race. The car does not feel as competitive as it did in Valencia last weekend but we are going to be in a good position to fight hard in qualifying.&quot; Hamilton was fastest in practice today but the opposition hoped the McLaren driver was running light on a day when setting up the car with a full load of fuel was the favoured option. &quot;We are not as quick as we&apos;d like to be but we are better than expected,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;We have got some changes to make. We&apos;re still not great in the high-speed corners so we have work to do in the middle sector of the lap because that is where the Red Bulls seem to be destroying us.&quot; Webber, Button and Barrichello completed more than 30 laps each while Sebastian Vettel, the fourth championship contender, was restricted to 25 laps. Vettel suffered two engine failures in Valencia, leaving the Red Bull driver with just two of his eight Renault V8s to see him through the rest of the season. Vettel will be handed a 10-place grid penalty if he has to use a ninth engine before the end of the season in Abu Dhabi. &quot;We expect the Brawns to be quick in Singapore and Abu Dhabi,&quot; said Webber. &quot;It is going to be hard. It&apos;s not an excuse \u2013 we capitalised when the tracks suited us. This championship is so tight that its venue dependent and the cars are sensitive to track temperatures. But there will always be pressure on the driver leading until he has won it.&quot; The season-closing Abu Dhabi grand prix on 1 November will be the first to start at dusk and finish under floodlights, according to a change in schedule announced today.

The Brazilian TV station Globo reported today that Nelson Piquet Jr was ordered to crash into a wall at the night race so that his team-mate Alonso could take advantage of an early pit stop. The FIA would not confirm that it was investigating that particular incident, only &quot;alleged incidents at a previous Formula One world championship event&quot;. Piquet was fired by Renault last month after a season and a half and the Brazilian driver complained about unequal treatment by the team principal Flavio Briatore compared to his two-time world champion team-mate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/31/renault-f1-singapore-gp-nelson-piquet-junior", "sentences": ["The FIA examination of last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix could lead to Renault quitting Formula One if their team is found guilty of interfering with the result of the floodlit race&apos;s inaugural running.", "The French manufacturer was considering quitting last year but Alonso&apos;s win in Singapore, and victory at the next race in Japan, secured the team&apos;s short-term future.", "The Singapore incident, if deliberate, is much more serious due to the risk of debris injuring other drivers and, possibly, spectators."], "publicationDate": "2009-08-31T17:51:34Z", "title": "Renault may quit Formula One over new cheating claim", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Bernie Ecclestone", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "The FIA examination of last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix could lead to Renault quitting Formula One if their team is found guilty of interfering with the result of the floodlit race&apos;s inaugural running. Although not mentioning Renault by name, the sport&apos;s governing body is likely to take a closer look at the race following the acquisition of fresh evidence. During the broadcast of Sunday&apos;s Belgian grand prix, the Brazilian network Globo TV reportedly said it had received information that Nelson Piquet Jr had been asked to crash on purpose and trigger the sequence of events that led to his team\u2011mate, Fernando Alonso, moving from the back to the front of the field and scoring a win that went against form in the previous 14 races. A spokeswoman for the ING Renault F1 Team said today that there would be no comment. Renault have been at the forefront of rumours that they would be the next to pull out of F1 following the withdrawal of Honda and BMW. The French manufacturer was considering quitting last year but Alonso&apos;s win in Singapore, and victory at the next race in Japan, secured the team&apos;s short-term future. Renault&apos;s best finish this year has been fifth place in Spain, an unsatisfactory result that could accelerate the decision to pull out should an inquiry find against the British-based team. If the FIA feels there is a case to answer, Renault could be called before the World Motor Sport Council and, if found guilty, face a heavy fine or even expulsion. Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One commercial rights-holder told the Times that he feared Renault could leave the sport as a result of the allegations. Ecclestone said that Flavio Briatore, the Renault team principal, had told him that he knows nothing about the claims that have been made. Ecclestone also described the Italian as &quot;well and truly upset&quot;, and added that Piquet could be finished as a Formula One driver. &quot;This is not the sort of thing we need at the moment,&quot; said Ecclestone. &quot;I think it will piss off Renault for a start. Them leaving the sport is a danger, obviously. I mean, I hope that it isn&apos;t like that, but it&apos;s the sort of thing that might happen.&quot; &quot;What I know, I can&apos;t say, to be honest with you. All I know is that Flavio is insisting that he knows nothing about it. I think the FIA are looking into everything. They are trying to find out the reality. I suppose they would be upset if they found out that what people are assuming is true, is in fact true, I suppose.&quot; When Piquet crashed on the 14th of 61 laps and sprayed debris across the track, the incident prompted the appearance of the safety car and caused every team bar Renault to immediately rethink their pit-stop strategy. A period of slow laps behind the safety car is the ideal time to refuel without losing an excessive amount of time. Renault were the exception because Alonso had refuelled three laps before Piquet&apos;s crash and rejoined at the back of the field. As the 18 cars running ahead of the former world champion made their pit stops, Alonso moved to the front. The question is: was Piquet ordered to crash or was the accident a handy coincidence for a team under pressure to score their first win of 2008? If it was the former, then Piquet was either incompetent or extremely brave. The heavy collision with the concrete wall lining the street circuit destroyed the right-hand side of the Renault and risked injury. Had Piquet wished to prompt the safety car, it would only have required a slightly more dramatic version of the incident employed by Michael Schumacher in 2005 when he parked his Ferrari against the barrier in Monte Carlo and hampered the progress of rivals during the closing minutes of qualifying. Schumacher was demoted to the back of the grid. A spokesmen for Piquet said he would be making no comment. The investigation comes less than two weeks after an angry Piquet referred to Flavio Briatore as his &quot;executioner&quot; after being sacked by the boss of Renault F1 and replaced by the Frenchman Romain Grosjean. Ferrari were accused of interfering with the result of the 2002 Austrian grand prix when Rubens Barrichello was ordered to move over in the final 100 metres and allow Schumacher to win. Ferrari were not reprimanded but the FIA banned team orders. The Singapore incident, if deliberate, is much more serious due to the risk of debris injuring other drivers and, possibly, spectators."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/02/boris-johnson-eu-regulation", "sentences": ["The Conservative mayor believes that proposals for an EU directive to regulate the alternative investment market \u2013 including European hedge funds \u2013 could see the London sector move to more attractive bases such as New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Geneva, resulting in billions of pounds of lost tax revenue."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-02T11:01:28Z", "title": "Boris Johnson warns of threat to London from EU financial services regulation plans", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Regulators", "European Union", "Politics", "UK news", "London politics", "London", "Business", "Hedge funds", "Alternative investments", "Money", "Economic policy"], "article": "Boris Johnson will warn today that London&apos;s status as the &quot;global capital of expertise&quot; is under threat from plans to regulate financial services, as he takes the fight to protect Britain&apos;s hedge fund and equity industry from European regulation to Brussels. The Conservative mayor believes that proposals for an EU directive to regulate the alternative investment market \u2013 including European hedge funds \u2013 could see the London sector move to more attractive bases such as New York, Singapore, Hong Kong and Geneva, resulting in billions of pounds of lost tax revenue. Johnson will use a meeting with Charlie McCreevy, the commissioner responsible for the regulation of financial services, to underline the huge impact that current EU draft directive would have by seriously weakening London as the main European marketplace for hedge funds, private equity and venture capital. City Hall says private equity and venture capital industries are overwhelmingly based in London, with 80% of European hedge funds and 60% of European private equity funds located in the British capital. Johnson, who is striving to protect the London economy from the ravages of the recession by positioning the capital as the undisputed world centre for business, said the private equity and venture capital industry directly employs around 7,000 people, with a further 35,000 people estimated to work either directly or indirectly for hedge fund managers. Johnson said there was &quot;no evidence&quot; that investment funds were in any way to blame for the global financial crisis: &quot;I have always said I&apos;m in favour of proportionate regulation, where necessary, and that this industry must learn from the mistakes of the past and work to put its reputation beyond dispute. However, I strongly feel that this draft directive should be amended to ensure that we do not cut off a vital supply of investment funding at a time when the economy needs it most.&quot; The mayor will argue that the draft directive, published in April, would substantially reduce the choices available for investors, put up protectionist barriers around Europe, and give a huge competitive boost to financial centres outside the EU \u2013 to London&apos;s, and ultimately Europe&apos;s, disadvantage. &quot;The directive as it is currently drafted will have enormously damaging consequences for London, for the UK, and for Europe too. There is no suggestion or evidence that investment funds were in any way to blame for the financial crisis and it is difficult to see the justification for this level of regulation.

The IOC&apos;s evaluation commission, which visited each of the bidding cities in turn earlier this year to rate the merits of Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid, laid out the pros and cons of each in a 93-page document yesterday. Chicago had been the early favourite because of the predicted &quot;Obama effect&quot; and the obvious commercial benefits of holding the games in the biggest market for sponsorship and TV rights, but Rio de Janeiro has come up on the rails after running a well regarded campaign in which President Lula has been a highly visible presence. Nor can Madrid, which enjoyed the highest level of national public support, be entirely discounted. IOC insiders said the race remained genuinely open. In light of the global recession that has taken hold since the bidding process began, there will be increased focus on the need for bidders to provide government guarantees. That could count against Chicago. In its report the IOC said only a capped guarantee of $750m (\u00a3460m) had been offered and it had knocked back an attempt by Chicago to amend the Host City Contract. But Chicago was praised for its plans for a &quot;compact&quot; games, with the majority of venues and hotels within five miles (8km) of the city centre and the commission said its lakefront Olympic Village would provide a &quot;special experience&quot; for athletes. The Tokyo bid won praise for plans that would &quot;generally facilitate very efficient games operations and travel&quot; and its &quot;fully achievable budget&quot; but there were concerns about low levels of public support and that some of the venues listed as already built were yet to be constructed. The Rio bid is backed by government guarantees and was praised for the high quality of its bid but the IOC commission questioned an accommodation plan that includes the use of six cruise ships and mentioned concerns around security. Brazil has already been awarded the 2014 World Cup, the effect of which on the voting intentions of IOC members is unclear. The 13-strong evaluation commission said it would accelerate the delivery of infrastructure and provide valuable experience but would also present a &quot;marketing and communications&quot; challenge. Much of Madrid&apos;s infrastructure already exists, with 23 out of 33 venues in place, and &quot;strong support and financial commitments&quot; have been received from local, regional and national government. Its high level of public support was also noted but the quality of documents and presentations relating to its bid were &quot;varied&quot; in quality and there were potential organisational challenges. The IOC president, Jacques Rogge, has said last year&apos;s Olympics in Beijing will be the last of the money-no-object spectaculars for the foreseeable future and that, in line with the bid that won the games for London, sustainability and legacy would become watchwords for would-be bidders. &quot;We are in the mode for lean games,&quot; he said earlier this year. Both Rio and Tokyo have attempted to tap into the IOC&apos;s desire to ensure the Olympics thrives in new markets and reaches younger generations. The Rio bid has majored on its ability to bring the games to South America for the first time and play a role in transforming the country and the continent. Tokyo claims that, by 2016, it will be able to reach the largest primetime audience in the world. &quot;We are particularly pleased that the IOC report recognises the power of a Rio games to deliver social transformation and our ability to &apos;leave an affordable and significant legacy&apos;,&quot; said Carlos Nuzman, president of the Brazilian Olympic Committee and Rio 2016, yesterday. London&apos;s victory in the race for the 2012 games is widely considered to have changed the terms of the debate for bidding cities, with &quot;compact&quot;, &quot;legacy&quot; and &quot;sustainable&quot; becoming the buzzwords. The 106 members of the IOC will announce the winning city in Copenhagen on 2 October, taking into account the information provided by each in their &quot;bid book&quot;, the conclusions of the evaluation committee and the final presentations that can swing votes at the last minute. In Singapore in 2005 it was felt that it was Lord Coe&apos;s dynamic speech, an empowering film focusing on the legacy for youth and then prime minister Tony Blair&apos;s glad-handing of delegates that helped London overcome the favourite, Paris. Vladimir Putin also played a crucial role in swinging the vote for the 2014 Winter games Sochi&apos;s way in 2007. President Lula has already committed to flying in to Copenhagen, as has King Juan Carlos for Madrid. Tokyo is expected to deploy the Japanese prime minister and the Chicago bid team is desperately hoping Obama will add some stardust to its final push in Copenhagen, although dignitaries will have less time to press IOC flesh than usual, with the vote taking place on the first full day of the congress. Rio de Janeiro  The pitch &quot;Live Your Passion&quot; \u2013 a bid based around &quot;celebration&quot; and &quot;regeneration&quot;. Pros Would take games to South America for first time; backed by president as part of regeneration plan and financially sound; young population would attract new audiences. Cons IOC raises &quot;public safety challenges&quot; but praises action plan; lack of hotel rooms; new transport infrastructure would be needed; fear 2014 World Cup will overshadow games.

Cons Concern at low level of public support; legacy plans for some venues unclear; concerns about the size of the land area available for construction of Olympic Village; lack of clear central message.  Chances of victory: 2/5 Madrid The pitch &quot;Games with the human touch&quot;, with a logo of an open hand &quot;representing open character of the city&quot;. Pros IOC praise for existing programme promoting sport and Olympic ideals; strong public support; recent bidding experience; 23 of 33 venues already in place; strong financial backing. Cons Plan for Olympic stadium could result in &quot;significant challenges&quot;; lack of delineation between stakeholders&apos; roles; too close to 2012 games in Europe. Chances of victory: 3/5 Chicago  The pitch &quot;Let friendship shine&quot;; &quot;a spectacular experience in the heart of the city&quot;.

Government debt has spiralled above \u00a340bn to fi refi ght the effects of the recession, but swinging cuts are imminent. Last week, the chief executive of the Audit Commission, Steve Bundred, kickstarted the debate by claiming that a \u00a350bn package of spending cuts and tax rises was necessary to keep UK plc afl oat. Local authorities were already gearing up to swallow the bitter pill of a significant funding shortfall, but the debate for them has moved on to how public services can be maintained \u2013 and even improved \u2013 under such straitened conditions. A recent roundtable discussion convened by the Guardian, in partnership with Kent county council, picked through the thorny issue of public service reform. It was held at Tunbridge Wells Gateway, the latest in a series of centres across the county that bring together a wide variety of county council, district council, central government, health and voluntary sector services under one roof. The Gateway approach, which began in 2005, was held up as an example of how savings can be made by rationalising public sector services at the point of delivery, while simultaneously improving the client experience. The main theme of the discussion was how government can reconnect with people at a local level and make use of technological innovations to make service delivery more effective and, ultimately, cheaper. It was agreed that to achieve this there needed to be a &quot;revolution&quot; in thinking: a &quot;journey to modernisation&quot; that would see customers as citizens designing their future experience. Some participants felt that people don&apos;t always know what services they need, which means that traditional ways of delivering local government services are becoming obsolete; they should be issue-based &quot;life event centres&quot;, and not fi xed to one agency off ering one specifi c service. A participant said one result of the recession was that people weren&apos;t asking for housing or council tax benefi ts, but instead were saying: &quot;I&apos;ve lost my job.&quot; &quot;All sorts of things will flow from that. They may need debt counselling, employment and benefits advice, training, volunteering. Gateway puts all that under one roof.&quot; &apos;Inventing tomorrow&apos;The discussion was likened to &quot;inventing tomorrow&quot;, with a bare structure in which to work. One participant said: &quot; Young people are using the web, they&apos;re still using the phone, and they still want face-to-face interaction. The balance is going to change. We don&apos;t know how much, but it will be dramatic.&quot; Short-term thinking was considered one of the main barriers to successful reform. Decision makers needed to face up to the fact that services should be transactional, and be largely available online. It was widely agreed that more resources did not equate to better quality public services, and vice versa. A participant pointed out on a wall map the hundreds of public sector buildings, saying: &quot; It&apos;s a disgrace how many there are. We don&apos;t need that many.&quot; Niche specialist providers were accused of wanting to build their own brand, to the detriment of service to the customer. &quot;We need to change our attitude to public space,&quot; said one participant, &quot;because there are billions of pounds worth of savings to be made.&quot; There was widespread frustration with the tribalism involved in administering public services. Agencies jealously guarding their branding was raised as a key barrier to the smooth integration of working practices. One person suggested an &quot;umbrella&quot; brand such as Gateway might make it harder for people to understand what services are available there. However, another participant said the Gateway project really had to be fought for, and people had to be won over and persuaded &quot;that the benefi ts were bigger than their brand&quot;. On the other hand, it was felt that brands such as Jobcentre Plus can be useful, as people know exactly what is on offer. Participants agreed that there was massive inertia to overcome. Legislation after regulation passed by the government has solidified a culture of conservatism within public sector professions, resulting in &quot;silo mentalities&quot; resistant to being customerfocused. &quot;Our job is to make a complex system simple for the general public,&quot; said one participant. &quot;That&apos;s the challenge for me \u2013 for all of us.&quot; The Department for Work and Pensions came under heavy fire for its perceived tribalism and inertia \u2013 which exacerbates its already heavy workload due to the recession \u2013 and for lacking a clear strategy to integrate with other agencies. There was further frustration with central government. People feel they have been &quot;defeated by bureaucracy&quot;, it was claimed. Some participants considered that the common denominator required was someone with a name, with a face, to explain things and help break the &quot;bureaucratic edifice&quot;. This apparent dichotomy with earlier assertions of a web-oriented service future was echoed by another participant, who said: &quot;Success is measured in terms of fewer people coming through the door, but customer satisfaction levels are lower online. It&apos;s no good driving everything online until we&apos;ve cracked multi-channel access.&quot; Pace of modernisationDeveloping this theme, it was claimed that public service modernisation hinged on Digital Britain \u2013 the plan of action for the UK&apos;s future in the digital and communications industry, developed by the minister for communications, technology and broadcasting, Stephen Carter \u2013 and the bandwidth of the UK&apos;s proposed broadband standard. The huge gap between the UK&apos;s target of 2Mbps speed and Singapore&apos;s 1Gbps was cited as an example of a lack of central government ambition. This would severely limit the pace of modernisation, one participant said. Kent was highlighted as an example of an authority seeking to harness technology, such as the single phone number used to access all public services, including health services. Efficiency of public buildings was raised, particularly using school buildings and facilities as a wider community resource: &quot;It would be politically great to say Kent&apos;s 600 schools never closed, and were open to communities, social and voluntary groups, but it just wouldn&apos;t be true,&quot; said a participant. The situation has got even worse with the county&apos;s flagship academies, apparently, with requests for shared services flatly turned down by governors and other vested private fi nance initiative (PFI) bodies. The PFI is a government initiative that provides a way to fund major capital investments without recourse to public funds. &quot; Spending departments are staggeringly unconnected, and it&apos;s a hard job to get them together and get them thinking creatively said a participant. &quot;And it would save them money if they did.&quot; A shakeup of local and central government publications was proposed by another participant as an example of a short-term money saver. &quot;Numerous publications through the door, each listing 52 websites, 35 phone numbers \u2013 and we think that&apos;s effective? It isn&apos;t.&quot; Local and central government working with other local agencies could save \u00a32m a year in Kent alone by combining publications and allowing advertising \u2013 with a long-term goal of publishing on the web only. The transformation of services leading to the closure of some public buildings provoked a passionate discussion. For instance, a postal-based system similar to a DVD rental club was proposed as a potential alternative to a community library . Just because a service is &quot;politically sensitive&quot; is no reason for it to get special treatment in these straitened times, it was argued. The response, particularly from the elected politicians present, suggested otherwise.  While local authorities were urged to &quot;use their elbows&quot; to eff ect change from the bottom up, the signifi cance of political will from the top was not lost. A description of the stages of government as being a morphosis from corporate cabinet to robber-barons was used to illustrate the traditional inertia of governing politicians. Would a Tory government have the will to transform public services , or would civil servants and the professions continue to spout empty rhetoric and act accordingly? &quot;Some people who have wanted to reform the wa public services work for several decades the recession as quite an opportunity,&quot; said one speaker. &quot;The future is going to have to be about better services for less cost. &quot; At the table William Benson, director of change and business support, Tunbridge Wells borough councilSir Michard Bichard, director, Institute for GovernmentClaire Bryce-Smith, comprehensive area assessment lead, Audit CommissionRoy Bullock, leader, Tunbridge Wells borough councilGreg Clark, MP for Tunbridge WellsJane Dudman, editor, PublicPeter Gilroy, chief executive, Kent County CouncilRoger Gough, cabinet member for corporate support services and performance management, Kent County CouncilPaul Howarth, head of housing benefit strategy division, Department for Work and PensionsDavid Magor, chief executive, Institute of Revenues, Rating and ValuationRichard McCarthy, director general of housing and planning, Department of Communities and Local GovernmentTanya Oliver, director of strategic development and public access, Kent County CouncilPete Searle, director of business strategy and planning, Jobcentre Plus"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/03/lehmans-assets-sold-off", "sentences": ["In a highly complicated case, there are parallel administrators working on Lehman subsidiaries in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-03T14:20:55Z", "title": "From uranium to contemporary art: Lehman's assets are sold off", "tags": ["Lehman Brothers", "Banking", "Business", "Money", "Economics"], "article": "The bank may be consigned to Wall Street history.

At the time of its collapse with $613bn in debts, Lehman had a vast array of investments ranging from an interest in a luxurious Miami apartment block, Canyon Ranch, to a fleet of corporate jets and millions of dollars worth of contemporary artwork, which once adorned the walls of the bank&apos;s executive suite. Liquidators even discovered that Lehman was sitting on a stockpile of enough mined uranium &quot;yellowcake&quot;, which, if enriched, could power a nuclear reactor or, notionally, make a bomb. The substance, a legacy from an exotic commodities trading arm, is locked up in secure storage facilities in Canada. In the US, creditors have until September 22 to file claims detailing what they believe they are owed by Lehman. In a highly complicated case, there are parallel administrators working on Lehman subsidiaries in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Australia. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is winding up the bank&apos;s British operation, recently said creditors&apos; claims on Lehman&apos;s UK businesses were likely to top $100bn. Transatlantic relations have become frayed as PwC has been reluctant to submit to a multilateral protocol for handling the estate, preferring to work to a British framework, to the dismay of its US counterparts. At a creditors&apos; meeting in July, the chief executive winding up Lehman, Bryan Marsal, said it could take as long as three years to unwind all of Lehman&apos;s derivatives contracts. He expressed frustration at a lack of co-operation: &quot;International protocol, what this is is trying to get receivers in various countries to work together so we can get out of this case before I die.&quot; The bank&apos;s former president and chief operating officer, Joe Gregory, recently lodged a claim for $233m in stocks, options and remuneration which, he said, he is owed by Lehman.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    It&apos;s quite entertaining in a cheap kind of way that Kit Malthouse, the Mayor&apos;s deputy for policing, is in trouble with Scotland Yard. In a Guardian interview he told the world what he&apos;s been telling people in his vicinity for months: that he and Boris have got their &quot;hands on the tiller&quot; of the Metropolitan Police and a jolly good thing too. During his chat with Vikram Dodd, Malthouse paid tribute to Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, whose accession to the post he supported and had paved the way for by bringing about the spectacular departure of Sir Ian Blair. Sir Paul, alas, responded with fury. The measured tone of his letter today belies his rage at any suggestion that under his leadership the Met has become the poodle of the Tories of City Hall. Malthouse might be regretting his own characteristic candour but I think Sir Paul has gone over the top. It&apos;s hardly novel for politicians to take credit for what police officers do and Malthouse&apos;s remarks were in part just a variation on that charming tradition. More importantly, it is quite legitimate for the Mayor&apos;s man to raise the issue of police accountability. As Tony Travers wrote at Comment is Free, the mechanisms for this are a complete mess where the Met is concerned, and the idea that police chiefs are never swayed by the influence of elected politicians to whom they are, in any case, already answerable in certain ways, is simply daft. It is difficult to judge whether Malthouse and the Mayor have brought about any significant or useful changes in the way the Met goes about its business. Three MPA members I spoke to - Toby Harris, Chris Boothman and Jenny Jones \u2013 were sceptical, while nameless voices from the Yard fondly describe Malthouse as &quot;full of himself&quot; and &quot;a nuisance to be got around&quot;. But I think the latter has performed a useful public service in re-opening the debate about the best and proper way for the police to be responsive to the democratic will. The Met is, in its own way, a highly political organization of a rather conservative kind. At least the Conservative politicians running City Hall have a mandate for what they do. Battersea Power Station I sympathise with Battersea architect Keith Garner when he says: &quot;You have this world-famous iconic building, on a beautiful riverside location in one of the world&apos;s greatest cities. What is the problem?&quot; Whatever it is, it is large and will not go away. Since being de-commissioned in 1983 Battersea Power Station and its surrounding land has had a succession of owners but not one of them has put the asset to good, alternative use. Boris Johnson vetoed the most recent grand scheme on grounds of excessive height, and although revised plans have been submitted the developers are in financial trouble.

Boris in Hedge Fund Rescue Mission On Wednesday our Mayor went to Brussels to tell a man from the EU that a proposed directive to regulate the alternative investment market \u2013 hedge funds, and other stuff only three people in the universe understand \u2013 would, unless adjusted, result in a mass migration of this mystery industry from London to Switzerland or Singapore at a terrible cost to us all. The much-publicised excursion was seized upon by some as the latest example of Boris taking a different line, or at least striking a different note, on key issues of our time from his leader David Cameron. Most Dave-Boris split stories turn out to be rather over-egged, but as news product they are box office, and with a general election looming they seem certain to proliferate, nurtured by the fact that ten percent of the Tories&apos; top 200 target seats are in the Greater London area. &quot;Has David Cameron got a Boris Johnson problem?&quot; asked Will Woodward. He came up with some very funny answers. Next Week City Hall politics will resume in earnest with September&apos;s Mayor&apos;s Question Time.

An investigation by the FIA led the sport&apos;s governing body to call Renault before an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September, days before the teams return to Singapore for the 14th round of the 2009 championship. The former world champions will answer charges that the team conspired with its driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, to crash deliberately with the aim of causing the deployment of the safety car to the advantage of Alonso. When Piquet hit the wall and spread debris across the track on the 14th of 61 laps, the heavy crash caused the appearance of the safety car. Alonso was the only driver in the field to have refuelled unusually early, three laps before the incident, before rejoining at the back of the field. As the 18 cars running ahead of the former world champion took advantage of the safety car and made their stops, Alonso gradually moved to the front to score a win that went completely against form for the struggling team. There is no precedent for such an alleged offence. Renault could face anything from a fine to exclusion from either the next race or, at worst, the 2009 world championship. The fear in F1 circles is that this could cause Renault to pull out. This will be the second visit by Renault to the FIA in as many months, the Anglo-French team successfully appealing against a one-race ban for the unsafe release of Alonso&apos;s car before a front wheel was properly attached during a pit stop in Hungary. The wheel came off and bounced across the track a minute later. The Singapore incident was potentially just as serious since the debris could have affected other drivers or gone into the crowd. The argument this time will centre on Renault&apos;s alleged interference with the outcome of the race. The FIA will have examined telemetry measuring steering inputs and throttle applications on Piquet&apos;s car as well as listening to pit-to-car radio communications."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/sep/05/climate-change-fund", "sentences": ["Brook likes companies such as Itron, a supplier of automatic meter-reading technology, and Epure, a Singapore-based company working on improving China&apos;s drinking water quality."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-04T23:05:16Z", "title": "Climate change funds: the next mega-trend?", "tags": ["Ethical money", "Investments", "Investment funds", "Money", "10:10 climate change campaign", "Environment", "Isas", "Climate change", "Water", "Ethical and green living", "Corporate social responsibility", "Investment Isas"], "article": "It is being dubbed the next &quot;mega-trend&quot; for the stockmarket. Companies that focus on alternative energy and combating climate change will offer outstanding growth for investors, while the environmental laggards will face increasing pollution taxes and penalties. Surely this is a one-way bet for investors with both profits and principles in mind? Already British investors, even those with as little as \u00a350 a month to invest, can choose from a number of funds promising to direct your cash into the environmental industries of the future. Schroders and HSBC were among the first to launch climate change funds in 2007, followed soon after by Virgin Money. Other big-name providers include F&amp;C and BlackRock (formerly Merrill Lynch). This summer Clare Brook, the doyenne of the green sector, launched the Sustainability fund backed by WHEB Ventures, a leading cleantech venture capital house. Next month sees Tiburon Green, the first fund focusing on efforts to tackle climate change in Asia. Does this sound like a bandwagon? Yes, say critics, who warn that the climate change &quot;story&quot; is already in the price of the shares, so investors coming in today will be burned. For example, at the end of 2007, shares in Q Cells, the cutting-edge German maker of solar power panels, were trading at nearly \u20ac100 (\u00a387). Today they are bumping along at \u20ac10. Meanwhile wind turbine maker Vestas, which closed its Isle of Wight plant, is trading at half its mid-2008 high. And does anyone remember Ballard, the Canadian zero-emission fuel cell maker, a one-time darling of the green energy sector? It traded at C$120 (\u00a366) in February 2000, but if you invested then you&apos;d have lost a fortune: it now trades at just C$1.70. There&apos;s a perception problem with environmental investing. Either (a) the technology fails and the shares become worthless; or (b) the technology works (like Q Cells) but the Chinese come in, massively over-produce, push down prices and wipe out profits. Financial advisers, traditionally conservative, tend to dismiss climate change funds as too narrow and specialist for mainstream investors. But the fact that hard-nosed fund managers at Britain&apos;s top investment houses are piling in suggests this is not just a product for bleeding-heart liberals. Simon Webber co-manages Schroder&apos;s Global Climate Change fund, one of the first to launch back in 2007. He says: &quot;Climate change is not going to go away. It will require us to move to a low-carbon economy, and will affect sectors such as transport, agriculture, retailing and infrastructure. It touches almost everything in our lives.&quot; He acknowledges the problems with solar. &quot;Last year we had no solar in the fund \u2013 we could see stocks were overpriced and the over-capacity coming along. That said, we will be changing our energy systems towards nuclear, wind and solar. It&apos;s hard to dispute.&quot; There are now at least 700 investable companies directly involved in climate change, says Schroders. HSBC has set up a FTSE 100-style index made up of companies involved in tackling climate change. Called the HSBC Climate Change Benchmark Index, it shows that, on average, since 2004, companies in the index have given investors a 48% gain (in dollar terms). But that conceals a rollercoaster ride. The index started at 100 in January 2004, soared to 235 in July 2007, then marched back down to 100.69 in March this year. Since then, it has leapt ahead again, and this week stood at 148.23. If that makes you fearful that you could be buying into a &quot;sucker&apos;s rally&quot;, then don&apos;t despair, says Brook. She has run Jupiter&apos;s Ecology fund, set up NPI&apos;s Global Care funds, and managed Aviva&apos;s SRI funds. She took each one from virtually nothing to nearly \u00a31bn in size. Sustainability is Brook&apos;s own fund and she says there&apos;s still a world of opportunity in environmental investing. She splits her fund between three &quot;mega-themes&quot; of climate change, water and demographics. What excites her most are the stocks that will benefit from the stimulus packages announced by governments to revive economies \u2013 many of which have distinct environmental promises. &quot;The beneficiaries of stimulus spending will be infrastructure such as rail, water piping, smart metering, energy efficiency and insulation,&quot; she says. Water is a huge climate change issue which will force massive spending to manage dwindling supplies. Brook likes companies such as Itron, a supplier of automatic meter-reading technology, and Epure, a Singapore-based company working on improving China&apos;s drinking water quality. Even the Mayfair hedge funds are getting involved. Tiburon Partners specialises in &quot;absolute returns&quot; from Asian stocks, but is now launching a hedge fund focusing on renewable energy \u2013 making money from stocks that will rise and also from ones they think will fall. Managing partner Mark Martyrossian believes &quot;there may be a good argument for going short German solar and long Chinese solar ... we&apos;re not saying smokestack China is going to disappear overnight, but the Chinese are introducing some great initiatives and it&apos;s happening at the local as well as national level.&quot; Tiburon is also launching a long-only version of the fund for more cautious investors.

Monza could not have asked for a more effective call to the faithful followers of what amounts to the only national team in F1 even though Ferrari has no hope of winning the title. Monza often goes a long way towards either settling the championship or prompting the defining of status within teams fortunate enough to have had two drivers previously in a position to fight for the crown. All of that would be plausible in a normal season of racing. But, as the last race showed with dramatic clarity, 2009 is anything but normal. The destiny of the title remains just as obscure as the identity of the favourite to succeed next Sunday. Kimi Raikkonen was the sixth different winner in six races, a statistic that would have been the subject of derision had it been predicted on 7\u00a0June after Jenson Button had won six of the first seven races. Rather than discussing diversity of success, the talk that evening in Turkey was whether the four races following Monza would be worth attending because Button would surely have become the second Englishman in successive years to be crowned world champion. The most extraordinary statistic now is that Button still heads the table by the same margin he had in his pocket after six races. Despite a lean period collecting 11 points, compared to the 61 he had amassed after Turkey, Button can hardly believe his luck as rivals take turns to stumble in the rush to kick the Brawn driver when he is down. The Belgian Grand Prix was a case in point. Button failed to score for the first time in 12 races thanks to being the victim of a first-lap collision which he could have avoided by making a better job of qualifying and removing himself from the rough company in the middle of the field. His worst grid position of the season had become a personal issue when Rubens Barrichello showed there was nothing wrong with the Brawn-Mercedes, only for the Brazilian to squander his second-row start by, not for the first time, making an appalling getaway and consigning himself to an afternoon chasing seventh place. Had Barrichello finished third, a reasonable assumption in light of what happened during the race, Button would have been looking at a 12-point lead. Depending on how the 53 laps of Monza pan out, Brawn&apos;s decision over future priority could become easier if Barrichello drops further behind. On the other hand, another dismal weekend for Button and a repeat of Barrichello&apos;s form in Valencia could allow the veteran to expect parity to continue to Singapore and Japan. Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, separated by 1.5 points, have no option but to carry on fighting each other as well as Brawn following a disappointing time at Spa, a track where the Red Bulls were supposed to blow away the opposition. But such a forecast did not take into account the infinitesimal technical variables that are dictating one of the closest seasons in recent years. Force India, scarcely mentioned in 2009, would have won in Belgium had not the first-lap collision prompted the safety car and allowed Raikkonen to use his Kers boost button (unique to Ferrari and McLaren in that race) and snatch the lead at the restart. Observers have been so surprised by Giancarlo Fisichella&apos;s pole position and exceptional chase of Raikkonen that one former world champion was heard to ask off the record if Force India had somehow been favoured at a time when the British-based team was known to be struggling financially and in need of a boost. The truth is that Spa was the first of just two tracks this year to require cars to run with a different aerodynamic set-up, one that suited the Force India and will do so again at Monza, another fast circuit requiring less downforce. Nonetheless, thoughts of foul play are a sad but perhaps unsurprising reflection of F1&apos;s image. That impression was promoted on Monday by stories that Renault might have contrived to influence the result of last year&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix by having their driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, crash at a strategic moment that helped his team mate, Fernando Alonso, to a surprise victory. The sport&apos;s governing body, FIA, was deliberately vague about the circumstances of the inquiry, and Bernie Ecclestone added to the inevitable innuendo by leaking Renault&apos;s name, even though policing of the sport is outside the remit of F1&apos;s commercial rights holder. Opinion is sharply divided over whether such a tactic is possible by stealth but, either way, the negative publicity could be the final straw for Renault. In the meantime, for two hours next Sunday afternoon, the sport should return to its more acceptable roots."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/06/rbs-asian-sell-off", "sentences": ["The bank sold its businesses in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group last month for \u00a3325m."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-06T17:45:40Z", "title": "RBS sells off last of Asian assets", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Standard Chartered", "Banking", "HSBC", "Recession", "Business"], "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is close to sealing a \u00a3200m deal to sell its retail and commercial banking operations in India, China and Malaysia to Standard Chartered, its British-based rival that specialises in emerging markets.

But if RBS opted to insure a lower sum and raise fresh capital from its institutional shareholders, the state&apos;s equity holding would be reduced and the taxpayer would save money. Last week, it emerged that Lloyds Banking Group, where the government speaks for 43%, is canvassing its shareholders about reducing its exposure to the APS and has outlined a number of proposals to the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority. In addition, Lloyds is weighing the possibility of launching a \u00a310bn rights issue.

This perspective needs to be reversed. The great Asian war had a seismic momentum of its own. Fighting began\u00a0in 1931 and there was barely a hiatus when Japan surrendered to the allies in August 1945. Between 1941 and 1945 alone, war claimed around 24 million lives in Japanese-occupied Asia, perhaps 3 million Japanese, and 3.5 million more in India through war-related famine. Of\u00a0these victims, the European, American and Australasian casualties numbered perhaps 1% of the total. But such tallies do not convey the full scale of the tragedy. Roads to war  The roots of war lay in western imperial competition in Asia and the quest of newly modernising states such as China and Japan for wealth, power and equality. Japan&apos;s rapid industrialisation, like that of the west, required privileged access to raw materials overseas. To Japan, to be a modern power was to be a colonial power. By the 1914-1918 war, she controlled the assets of Korea and Taiwan, and demanded greater access to those of China. Resistance to Japanese imperialism was a defining moment of national awakening in China. Japan&apos;s insistence on its &quot;special interests&quot; in China flew in the face of the so-called &quot;open door&quot; policy that was backed by the United States, Britain and the League of Nations. Many Japanese soldiers and politicians now saw the international system as a form of racial exclusion, designed by the western powers to protect their own imperial interests, and to deny newcomers theirs. In 1918, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, a later prime minister, wrote that it condemned Japan &quot;to remain forever subordinate to the advanced nations&quot;. When after 1928, a stronger central government arose in China under Chiang Kai-shek, and was recognised by the west, Japan was increasingly isolated. As the great depression squeezed resources, many argued that the only way for Japan to progress was to go it alone. In 1931, Japanese armies annexed the mineral-rich Chinese province of Manchuria [Manchukuo], and created a puppet regime under Pu Yi, China&apos;s last emperor. The initiative came from commanders in the field who wanted to commit civilian politicians at home to a bolder imperial policy. In July 1937, a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese troops near Beijing was escalated by the Japanese into a war of conquest of the north-east and maritime provinces \u2192 \u2190 of China. When the capital Nanjing fell in December 1937, a huge number of civilians, probably more than 300,000, were massacred. This brutal campaign overshadows Sino-Japanese relations to this day. The Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek fled to the inland city of Chongqing. It was weakened and corrupt, but committed to modernising China and restoring its sovereignty. A\u00a0patriotic &quot;united front&quot; was patched up between Chiang and his main rivals, Mao Zedong&apos;s communists, who gathered strength in their northern redoubt of Yan&apos;an. It was a fragile truce, not a working alliance. &quot;The Japanese are a disease of the skin,&quot; Chiang said in 1941, &quot;the communists are a disease of the heart.&quot; But Chiang had gained time and allies. President Franklin D Roosevelt&apos;s family fortune came from the China trade; he believed that a democratic China was destined to lead modern Asia. But he was not prepared to go to war for it. Nor were the British. Instead they supplied Chongqing by air and road over the &quot;Hump&quot; from British Burma. By late 1941, a US soldier, the acerbic &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell, was in effective command of Chiang&apos;s troops. He considered Chiang a &quot;stubborn bugger&quot;, reluctant to commit Chinese armies to battle, but Stilwell under-estimated Chiang&apos;s wiliness in drawing the Japanese into a long, costly war they could not win. Japan now felt even more tightly encircled by the ABCD powers: America,\u00a0Britain, China and the Dutch. The Netherlands East Indies was the best available source of oil for the war effort in China: Borneo and South Sumatra produced more than eight million tonnes a year. But blocking Japan&apos;s path to it was the British &quot;fortress&quot; of Singapore. On 27 September 1940, Japan entered into a fateful tripartite pact with Germany and Italy. For Japan, Wilhelmine Germany had been a model for a modernising, martial monarchy. As Japanese politics lurched to the right, fascism too seemed a &quot;kindred spirit&quot;. Both Germany and Japan spoke of shattering and remoulding the international order. But Japanese leaders were motivated by a deeper conviction that Emperor Hirohito was to be the nucleus of a new regional cosmology: a &quot;greater east Asian co-prosperity sphere&quot;. After the fall of Paris, Japan occupied French Indochina to cut off a supply route to Chongqing and as a springboard to the south. But the European war presented new obstacles to Japan&apos;s destiny in Asia. It caused the United States to expand its navy and to look more sympathetically upon the British empire in Asia, to help Britain fight on in Europe. Crucially, the occupation of Indochina was met by crippling economic sanctions from the United States and the west, effectively cutting off Japan&apos;s imports of oil. In late 1940 and 1941, as positions hardened and diplomacy failed, the argument was voiced in Tokyo that only by war could these obstacles be overcome. As Japan&apos;s militant new prime minster Hideki Tojo told an imperial conference on 5 November 1941: &quot;I fear that we would become a third-class nation after two or three years if we just sat tight.&quot; Japan&apos;s 70 days On 8 December 1941, Yamashita Tomoyuki&apos;s 25th Army landed on the north-east coast of Malaya and began a driving charge down the peninsula to Singapore. The British had long expected this, but failed to launch their planned pre-emptive strike into neutral Thailand, so-called Operation Matador. What was not foreseen was the simultaneous strike by air and sea at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This achieved the short-term goal of removing the immediate threat of the US Pacific fleet. But, given the fury of America&apos;s reaction, it made Japan&apos;s rather vaguer\u00a0long-term goal \u2013 a negotiated and advantageous peace \u2013 much harder to attain. The British in Malaya viewed the Japanese with racist contempt. &quot;I\u00a0suppose you&apos;ll push the little men off,&quot; was the reported reaction of the governor of Singapore. But British, Australian and Indian troops were confronted by hardened veterans of the China war, advancing 20km a day by bicycle. Allied forces fell back into Singapore with a speed that did not allow them to regroup and counter-attack effectively. But &quot;fortress Singapore&quot; was a myth. There were no fixed land defences to\u00a0speak of, few modern warplanes, and the naval base had no capital ships.\u00a0When the Prince of Wales and Repulse were sent to the South China Sea, they were sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. Reinforcements poured into Singapore, only to witness in disgust the scorched earth destruction of the naval base they had been sent to defend. The brutal reality was that for Churchill and the chiefs of staff in London, the first call on war materials was the Mediterranean theatre. Churchill ordered the garrison to fight and die to the last man. But at the hour of the final assault on Singapore town, fearing a wholesale slaughter of civilians, local commanders were given leave to surrender on 15 February 1942. The campaign had lasted only 70 days. Lost armies  Without pause, the Japanese pressed on into the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos. Four days after the fall\u00a0of\u00a0Singapore, bombs fell for the first\u00a0time on Australian soil. The Australian cabinet demanded the recall of their troops. Many of them were among the 85,000 soldiers marched into captivity in Singapore. The entire colonial order in Asia was incarcerated. On the best estimates, there were 130,895 civilian internees of the Japanese, more than 11% of whom were to perish. Of the 132,134 prisoners of war, 35,756 died in captivity. But these figures do not include the Asian soldiers captured, the 45,000 Filipinos who fought with the Americans, or some 40,000 Indians in Singapore. Abandoned by their European officers, the Indians were presented with a huge moral dilemma. It seemed as if the British had &quot;handed them over like cattle&quot;, and many were now recruited into a new Indian national army to fight alongside Japan for India&apos;s liberation. British prestige in Asia was shattered by the abandonment of its people. The ugly evacuation of Europeans was, as one British nurse in Penang put it, &quot;a thing that I am sure will never be forgotten or forgiven&quot;. Convinced that the British empire was on the point of collapse, Japan attacked Burma from Thailand. The initial aim was limited: to prevent the reinforcement of Malaya from India. But it became all-out conquest. British reluctance to call on the Chinese to save the British empire meant that intervention by Chinese forces under Stilwell came too late. It\u00a0cost the Chinese more than 10,000 men. As the British retreated, one of the largest displacements of people in history occurred as around 600,000 Indian refugees fled west to Bengal; as many as 80,000 of them died on the wayside. It was the Indian army that made Britain a power of consequence in Asia. During the war, more than two million Indians were recruited to arms. But Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian National Congress did not see it as India&apos;s war. The &quot;Quit India&quot; protests of 1942 were a challenge on a scale not seen since the great rebellion of 1857. As the stragglers from Burma stumbled into the great imperial city of Calcutta, it seemed to herald the imminent apocalypse of the Raj. In Burma, the Japanese were welcomed by some as liberators. Around 18,000 young nationalists travelled in their train as a &quot;Burma independence army&quot;. In the villages, they kindled a promise of freedom and martial revival. In Indonesia, it was said that the Japanese fulfilled the prophecy of the 12th-century king, Joyoboyo: that the rule of the white man would end with the coming of the dwarfish yellow men, who would reign only as long as &quot;a maize seed took to flower&quot;. But for the 2.3 million overseas Chinese of Malaya and Singapore it was the bitterest defeat. Their campaigns for &quot;national salvation&quot; had raised around one third of Chongqing&apos;s war expenditure. Chinese volunteers fought in the last-ditch defence of Singapore, and joined guerrilla bands in the jungle. One Japanese commander described entering Malaya as if it was &quot;the crossroads of the central province of China&quot;. When Singapore fell, between 50,000 and 100,000 Chinese were slaughtered in a so-called &quot;purification by elimination&quot;. Rape was an instrument of war; the standard military-issue condom was branded &quot;Assault No 1&quot;, and young girls began to be coerced as &quot;comfort women&quot; for Japanese soldiers, perhaps 80,000 to 100,000 across occupied Asia. Global war Japan&apos;s war was a gigantic gamble: that\u00a0its forces could win enough audacious victories and hold on long enough to their gains to win a favourable peace. But no American air-carriers or submarines had been destroyed at Hawaii, and they now preyed on Japanese shipping. Dutch and British &quot;scorched earth&quot; further reduced the spoils of conquest. By 1944, oil production in Indonesia was below half its pre-war level. The military-industrial arithmetic was decisive. During the war, Japan produced 70,000 warplanes; the US 300,000 \u2013 and 10 times more munitions. This was now global total war. But in many ways Japan was as isolated as ever. Axis cooperation amounted to little. The key agreements had come late in the day, and set the boundaries of each other&apos;s operations rather than combining them. There was no concerted assault on India. Strategic objectives diverged further over Russia. Japan had joined the axis partly to reduce the risk of war with the Soviets. But this again became a possibility when the Nazi-Soviet pact was thrown aside. Although Hitler disliked the idea of even &quot;honorary Aryans&quot; fighting in Germany&apos;s war of destiny in the east, Japan&apos;s help was sought in January 1943. It declined. Its &quot;final war&quot; was to be fought in the Pacific, with indifference, ultimately, to Germany&apos;s fate. By May 1942, Japan&apos;s perimeter was at its widest extent. But at the same moment, it was contained and turned back in the Pacific at Coral Sea and Midway, where the Japanese lost four carriers and more than 300 warplanes. In the south, the Japanese suffered their first defeat by land, when their landings in New Guinea were repulsed by the Australians and Americans in a series of battles that saw some of the heaviest casualty rates of the war. These were not perhaps the irreversible &quot;turning points&quot;, but they allowed the allies to think in offensive terms. One effect of containment in Asia was to allow the United States to maintain a strategy that placed &quot;Europe first&quot;. In Cairo, between 22 and 26 November 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and Chiang came face to face for the first time. Roosevelt gave the generalissimo great power status, but privately he asked Stilwell: &quot;How long do you think Chiang can last?&quot; Chiang was not present at the conference two days later with Stalin in Tehran, at which the invasion of France took precedence over all else. The new South East Asia Command (SEAC) under Lord Louis Mountbatten did not mean, as Americans quipped, that they would &quot;Save England&apos;s Asian \u2190 Colonies&quot;. Mountbatten&apos;s cherished plans for amphibious landings in Malaya were not executed until after the surrender of Japan. Unable to take war to Japan themselves, the British employed others to wage it on their behalf. In Burma, ethnic minorities such as the Shan, Kachin and Karen were armed against the Japanese and Burmese. In Malaya, by August 1945, around 5,000 fighters of the Malayan Communist party were kitted out with guns and khaki by air drops to support the allied invasion that never came. The seeds of future confrontations were sown. The new Asia  As the first fury of conquest subsided, the Japanese attempted to build a new Asia. A formidable propaganda machine promoted Nippon language, culture and modernity, and attempted to recruit Asian leaders to its cause. This often backfired. Attempts to rally Islam by calls of jihad, and ordering worshippers in the mosques to bow in prayer not towards Mecca, but towards the imperial palace in Tokyo, outraged the Muslims of Malaya and Indonesia. Japanese pan-Asianism was less important in what it achieved for Japan than in providing a platform for Asian politicians \u2013 men such as Sukarno in Indonesia and Aung San in Burma \u2013 to realise their own national visions, and to raise their own armies. On 4 July 1943, prime minister Tojo appeared at a rally in Singapore. At his side was Subhas Chandra Bose,\u00a0a\u00a0radical Congress leader who had\u00a0escaped arrest by the British in India in 1941 and fled to Berlin. In a rare joint operation, he was transferred from a German to a Japanese submarine off the coast of Madagascar and flown to Tokyo. Bose&apos;s charisma as national leader rallied the Indians in south-east Asia behind the Indian national army. He proclaimed a provisional government of &quot;free India&quot;, and toured the region, raising funds. Young Indian women threw their jewellery at his feet and enlisted to fight alongside the men. Their call was &quot;Chalo Delhi!&quot; (&quot;On to Delhi!&quot;), the cry of the mutineers of 1857. Rumours of this soon reached India; it was the beginning of the end of the Indian army as an instrument of British power in Asia. But as war conditions deteriorated, Japanese idealism died, and most Asians only saw imperialism in another form. Japan plundered its colonies for war materials and coerced labour for the Bangkok-Rangoon railway and other projects; more than 70,000 men from Malaya alone. The supply of food broke down across all fronts. In Bengal alone in 1943, more than 3.5 million people died from starvation and disease. The loss of the rice bowl of Burma was compounded by the failures of the British Raj. Final throws  Japanese commanders saw Britain as the weakest of the enemies that encircled them. In March 1944, supported by 40,000 troops of the Indian national army, and hoping to precipitate a revolt within India, the Japanese launched their forces in Burma at the frontier. In China, the massive Ichi-go offensive attempted to destroy the airfields from which US bombers attacked Japanese shipping and cities. These were last, desperate throws of the dice. In Burma, half a million men were locked in some of the bitterest fighting of the war. The British positions in Kohima and Imphal held for five months. Then William Slim&apos;s 14th Army \u2013 Britons, Indians, Gurkhas, Africans \u2013 began to strike forward into Arakan. As reports of Japanese atrocities circulated among the troops, Slim reported, &quot;quarter was neither asked, nor given&quot;. The young Japanese soldiers they faced believed the survival of their homeland was at stake. In the words of the soldier-poet Alun Lewis, they fought &quot;Sleeplessly watching, knifing and falling back&quot;. British and Indian troops were now better led, better provisioned, and backed by US warplanes and the resources of the Indian subcontinent. But the turning of &quot;defeat into victory&quot; was largely the work of Indian soldiers, traders and officials, who would not accept a return to the status quo. The Raj was a mighty weapon of war, but once loosed, the recoil shook the British empire to its foundations. In the Pacific, General MacArthur&apos;s combined operations punched ahead towards Palau and Saipan, which put B-29 bombers in range of Japan&apos;s major cities. These turning points were achieved at a shocking human cost, and greater costs now had to be weighed: not least that of assaulting Japan&apos;s home islands. Britain was desperate to redeem the disasters of 1942 by regaining Malaya by right of arms. In China, Mao&apos;s armies grew while Chiang&apos;s faced heavy attrition. There was much blood and treasure still to be expended, and the shape of the post-war regional order was still in the balance. It was at this point that Asia&apos;s peoples began to grasp a future beyond empire. Young fighters prepared to strike out in the name of the nation. One of the abiding legacies of war was the political legitimacy it gave to men in uniform and to violent, revolutionary change. When, a year later, Japan collapsed more suddenly than anyone could have imagined, across south-east Asia and in China itself, this merely unleashed a new phase of the long and terrible Asian war.

Photograph: AP    Aquascutum trenchcoats have been worn by royalty, political leaders and celebrities ranging from three Princes of Wales, Sir Winston Churchill and Baroness Thatcher to Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Michael Caine. The British fashion brand&apos;s history stretches back to 1851 when Mayfair tailor John Emary opened a menswear shop in Regent Street. A couple of years later, he patented a method of producing a water-repellent textile. He then named the company Aquascutum, from the Latin words aqua (water) and scutum (shield). Soon the streets of Mayfair were filled with men wearing the &apos;Aquascutum Wrapper&apos;. During the Crimean war, British army officers wore the grey raincoats to withstand the Russian winter. In the late 1870s, Emary and his son left Regent Street and handed Aquascutum over to Scantlebury &amp; Commin. Under its lead, the brand became known for weather resistant and comfortable clothes for walking, riding, shooting and golf. A trademark was registered in 1895. The Aquascutum overcoats were worn by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who granted Scantlebury &amp; Commin Aquascutum&apos;s first royal warrant in 1897. With women leading more active lives, the company started designing shower-proof coats and suits for ladies and opened a womenswear department in 1900. In 1909, the first factory opened in Corby, Northamptonshire. Facing demand from the military, whose overcoats were usually not lined, Aquascutum came up with the trenchcoat, featuring removable, buttoned-in lining. After the first world war, the trenchcoat became part of civilian wardrobes. Second world warDuring the second world war, allied soldiers, sailors and airmen wore Aquascutum&apos;s coats into battle. After the war, the coats made it onto the silver screen with Humphrey Bogart sporting the &quot;Kingsway&quot; trench both in films and in private. Later Peter Sellers wore an Aquascutum coat in The Pink Panther Strikes Again. The 1980s saw the launch of a wide range of accessories in the club check pattern. The company went through a period of expansion, opening shops in the US, Canada, France, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore. From 1987, when she paid her historic visit to the USSR, the wardrobe of prime minister Margaret Thatcher was supplied by Aquascutum, from coats and tailored suits to dresses and evening wear.

The entrepreneur Harold Tillman, best known for his transformation of Jaeger, has clinched a deal to buy the fashion brand from its Japanese owner, Renown, for an undisclosed sum. The deal will bring two of Britain&apos;s oldest luxury brands together and create a fashion house with combined sales of more than \u00a3300m. Tillman, the chairman and majority owner of the 125-year-old retailer Jaeger, and Belinda Earl, Jaeger&apos;s chief executive, are working together on the acquisition. Earl said: &quot;We see further opportunities to build on Aquascutum&apos;s rich and long history for outerwear and tailoring as well as for new product collections.&quot; The deal puts an end to the uncertainty hanging over Aquascutum. The 158-year-old brand was put under review by Renown in the spring after turnaround plans failed. Talks of a management buyout collapsed and Aquascutum&apos;s chief executive, Kim Winser, walked out in May. The company&apos;s 340-strong workforce, including 120 at its Corby factory, were left with an uncertain future after a firm offer failed to materialise from a suitor in Hong Kong, its distributor YGM Trading, despite an informal agreement being signed. Renown had bought Aquascutum for \u00a520bn (\u00a3130m) in 1990. The acquisition is a coup for Tillman, who chairs the British Fashion Council, ahead of London fashion week. Aquascutum had also attracted interest from rival fashion house Crombie, owned by multimillionaire Alan Lewis. Aquascutum was founded in London&apos;s Regent Street in 1851 by the Mayfair tailor John Emary, who patented his new technology for producing water-resistant cloth. He then named the company using the two Latin words aqua and scutum, meaning water shield. Grey Aquascutum raincoats were worn during the Crimean war by British army officers. In the late 1870s, Emary and his son left Regent Street and handed Aquascutum over to Scantlebury &amp; Commin. Under its lead, the brand became known for weather-resistant and comfortable clothes for walking, riding, shooting and golf. A trademark was registered in 1895. Aquascutum overcoats were worn by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who granted Scantlebury &amp; Commin Aquascutum&apos;s first royal warrant in 1897. The company started designing shower-proof coats and suits for women and opened a womenswear department in 1900. In 1909, the first Aquascutum factory opened in Corby, Northamptonshire. During the first world war, in response to demand from the military, whose overcoats were usually not lined, the firm developed the trenchcoat, with a removable, buttoned-in lining. The 1980s saw a period of expansion, with shops being opened in the US, Canada, France, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore. In the 1990s, Aquascutum supplied the official uniforms for the British Olympic team. When Kim Winser became chief executive in 2006, she signed James Bond star Pierce Brosnan as the face of the brand, followed by Brazilian model Gisele B\u00fcndchen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/sep/09/teenage-bloggers", "sentences": ["After all, we&apos;re basically a bunch of ordinary teenage kids doing stuff we enjoy, and it&apos;s that experience people want to be part of.&quot; Angelique, student confessor Blog Raining Noodles (raining-noodles.blogspot.com)A witty, well-written confessional on everything from this semi-anonymous 20-year-old&apos;s course work in Singapore to the state of her hamster&apos;s health.", "In her own words &quot;I&apos;m in Singapore, unfortunately in law school."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-08T23:05:04Z", "title": "The teen bloggers who took over the internet", "tags": ["Blogging", "Technology", "Internet", "Life and style", "Media", "Culture", "World news"], "article": "It&apos;s a teenage rite of passage to invent new worlds: worlds of the imagination, gangs, cliques and clubs, worlds apart from adults. And then came the internet, where anyone can be anything, a meta-persona of your own choosing. There are hundreds of millions of blogs; a new one is created each second \u2013 many by teenagers. Most are probably adolescent doodlings, some may be undiscovered gems. And then there are the blogs which \u2013 usually with a fair bit of luck - suddenly set the blogosphere abuzz. Usually, these are sites that look and read more like the next generation of &quot;e-zine&quot; than something knocked up in\u00a0a 15-year-old&apos;s bedroom. Such blogs from all over the world (although most commonly the US) attract tens, sometimes hundreds, of thousands of readers a month. They can pull in advertising revenues (albeit small), and their creators become stars when they come to the attention of the mainstream media. Tavi Williams, a 13-year-old self-confessed &quot;dork&quot;, became an influential player in the fashion world almost overnight after her Style Rookie blog was featured in the New York Times last year. You can understand the NYT&apos;s interest. Adults have always been desperate to get an insight into what teens are thinking, and business even more so. Somewhere out there is the New Next Big Thing, and it&apos;s almost certainly being dreamed up by a bunch of teenagers. Even Katie Grand, stylist, editor and one of the most influential women in fashion, has devoted the second issue of her magazine, Love, to teens, with bloggers to the fore. &quot;The fashion industry is really aware at the moment that it has to look at new territories,&quot; says Grand. &quot;When I was having meetings with advertisers for this issue, two big Italian houses said they felt that their clients were getting older and they weren&apos;t looking at the youth market enough. &quot;The difficult part was motivating anyone from that teen age group to get involved with a magazine. Very few kids are bothered about the printed word; we would work really hard on finding these kids, but then you&apos;d get a call at six in the morning saying, &apos;I&apos;ve missed my train, so I&apos;m not coming to the photo shoot.&apos;&quot; Tavi is the queen of the teen bloggers, and fashion houses have gone out of their way to court her. For a time, there was a suspicion her blog was so professional that it must be a stunt created by industry insiders, but she appears to be the real deal: a 13-year-old who has something to say and can say it well. &quot;Kids often start writing blogs just for the hell of it,&quot; says Sadie Stein, a\u00a0contributing editor at the US online feminist fashion mag, Jezebel. &quot;Sometimes it&apos;s because they are feeling isolated in small conservative towns and want to connect with other kids; sometimes it&apos;s because they have areas of specialised interest they want to share.&quot; Two teenaged examples that have grown into serious sites are Philadelphian gastro-obsessive Nick Normile&apos;s Foodie at Fifteen and, in the UK, Charlie Lyne&apos;s movie-mad Ultra Culture. &quot;The key to getting a higher profile,&quot; says Stein, &quot;is to get linked to better known websites. But to make it really big, ironically you need to get noticed by the established print media: a mention in a well-known newspaper can massively increase the number of hits a website gets overnight. And getting picked up in this way is usually down either to luck or good self-promotion \u2013 neither of which has much to do with the quality of the blog itself.&quot; It&apos;s no coincidence that many of the most &quot;popular&quot; teen blogs are those written by girls interested in style and fashion. Designers and retailers recognise teenage girls as a hugely important and profitable market, and so the personalities of their teen blog-idols has become a powerful commodity. Tavi has been sent clothes by Rodarte, and is reportedly read by Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons, while Karla Deras, who writes a blog called Karla&apos;s Closet, has featured in an advertising campaign for American Apparel. Stein acknowledges that business and media tend to seek out young girls, suggesting that &quot;perhaps society doesn&apos;t consider the opinions of boys to be as interesting&quot;. But Sam Wolfson, a 19-year-old from London who is one of the creators of Readplatform, a website to which established bloggers are invited to contribute, sees it slightly differently. &quot;Being young is often a real advantage if you are a girl,&quot; Wolfson says. &quot;For a boy, being young is often taken as a sign of inexperience and people are less inclined to take you seriously. The great thing about the internet is that you can be who you want to be. There are probably many blogs being written by teenage boys who are going out of their way to keep their anonymity in order to get credibility. So there&apos;s no real way of knowing just how many male teenage bloggers there are.&quot; Readplatform was set up to maximise the chances of contemporary teenage lifestyle and music sites getting noticed, and now picks up about 60,000 unique hits a month. While this has not yet translated into advertising revenue it has attracted the interest of market researchers, who have spotted the potential of being hot-wired into some of the most influential teenage trend-setters in the capital, and are prepared to pay for the privilege. At which point, the teen blogosphere starts to feel distinctly grown-up. And just like a teenager passing into adulthood, the next question is surely whether idealism then gives way to cynicism. Tavi Williams, fashion blogger Blog Style Rookie (tavi-thenewgirlintown.blogspot.com) Fashion and compassion from this ridiculously precocious 13-year-old from Chicago. Clever mix of high-end style and knowing kookiness, plus campaigning for genocide victims in Darfur on the side. High point so far Where to start? Being love-bombed by Rei Kawakubo (Comme des Garcons) and the New York Times. Being sent free clothes by\u00a0Rodarte. In her own words &quot;I don&apos;t feel like a part of the industry, not really. I was just at a shoot where some of the people couldn&apos;t believe someone my age was at this place. But I&apos;m just sitting at home typing about stuff that interests or amuses me. Part of the reason some people in the industry take an interest in my blog is that, at this point, basically everything has been done before. But because I am younger and insecure about other things instead of appearances, it is easier for me to try out kooky things. &quot;The blog is profitable for me in ways not to do with money \u2013 the people I&apos;ve met; the books, movies and music that I probably would not have discovered until I was much older.&quot; Kristin Prim, shopping guru Blog Kristin Prim (kristinprim.com)Peppered with moody black-and-white shots of 15-year-old New Yorker Prim&apos;s hair covering half her face. She&apos;s also confident at giving tips to those who email in (although the main question seems to be: &quot;how can you afford it?&quot;) Almost every one of her blogs is an account of some clothes shopping trip \u2013 she doesn&apos;t stint herself. High point so far Being featured in French Glamour, Teen Vogue and Italian Elle. In her own words &quot;I started blogging when I was 12 years old. At the age of 14 I began my own magazine, &quot;prim&quot;. I tend to blog about my personal style, shopping trips, prim itself and my inspirations. I get countless emails a day from readers, but the &quot;weirdo&quot; comments are few and far between. If I ever do receive one it just gets deleted right away; I don&apos;t even continue reading it. It&apos;s not worth my time. &quot;Many times editors of magazines live behind their pages and don&apos;t get to be seen. Blogging is my ploy to step away from the publication and share my personal style, likes and dislikes with the industry.&quot; Julie Zeilinger, angry young feminist Blog The F Bomb (thefbomb.org)Grungy, angry, inspiring site by this 16-year-old feminist from Pepper Pike, Ohio. High point so far Getting mentioned in Jezebel, one of the US&apos;s leading feminist blogs. In her own words &quot;I began blogging this year because the mainstream feminist blogs I read weren&apos;t representing the teenage perspective on issues that directly affect us. I write about feminist issues from a teenager&apos;s perspective, such as reproductive justice, body image and sexism in the media \u2013 anything that is impacting my generation and needs to be discussed. &quot;I get about 13,000 hits a month. Now that I have a significant readership, other people have urged me to look into advertising, but I don&apos;t want the F Bomb to be about money in any way. I spend hours every day writing for the blog, moderating comments, social networking and reading submissions from other people. It&apos;s difficult because I&apos;m a full-time student, but I really do love it. Maybe once I&apos;m not a teenager anymore I&apos;ll pass it on, so that there will always be a supportive and interactive community out there for teenage feminists. &quot; Stephen Yellin, politico Blog The Yellin Report  (yellinreport.blogspot.com) American Stephen Yellin began blogging as a 13-year-old under the alias Mr\u00a0Liberal but now, aged 21 and at Drew University in New Jersey, he writes as much under his own name both for his own blog and the online political magazine, the Daily Kos. Precociously assured. High point so far Getting a regular slot on the Daily Kos which helped make him a phenomenon Stateside. Was profiled in the NY Times, and attended the 2004 Democratic National Convention as part of the press corps. In his own words &quot;When I started back in 2001, I didn&apos;t think very much about my age \u2013 I never felt intimidated or out of my depth while blogging about politics, and have always done my homework before writing about a candidate. But when I started writing columns at the Daily Kos, some bloggers found it hard to believe I was &apos;only&apos; 15. Initially, I was offended they were assuming a teenager couldn&apos;t be an authority on politics. But then it hit me that it was an advantage to be a teenage blogger, particularly in a field where the vast majority of bloggers were older than me. &quot;As I moved into my college years, I&apos;ve found myself blogging less. My life&apos;s orientation has changed, and while I have (mostly) great memories of my time as a teenage blogger, being an active adult blogger isn&apos;t on the cards.&quot; Nick Normile, foodie Blog Foodie at Fifteen \u2013 Now 16(foodieatfifteen.blogspot.com)Nick Normile, a 16-year-old from Philadelphia, is a man obsessed. He&apos;s hell-bent on becoming a top chef and spends as much of his spare time as possible trying out new recipes and eating posh nosh. Best moment Getting five-star service at the French Laundry&apos;s New York sister restaurant, and a thumbs-up from food writer Michael Ruhlman. In his own words &quot;I had become serious about cooking 18 months before I started my blog, after going to one of Philadelphia&apos;s best restaurants, La\u00a0Croix, and asking to be given lessons. They were surprised to find someone so young coming along and took me under their wing, offering me an apprenticeship at weekends. I&apos;ve been working there on a Saturday or Sunday ever since. &quot;I first began to get a lot of followers after I wrote about how I had saved up to make a trip to New York to eat at the French Laundry&apos;s sister restaurant, Per\u00a0Se. I guess it was an unusual thing for a 15-year old to do on his own and I got quite a lot of media coverage which resulted in my site getting linked to other bigger sites. My peak viewing figure has been 10,000 hits in a single day and I now use Google&apos;s advertising blogging software and can upload Google&apos;s ads for free. So far, I&apos;ve made about $299.97. I don&apos;t do it for the money, but what does come in helps pay to keep the site running.&quot; Charlie Lyne, film critic Blog Ultra Culture (ultraculture.co.uk)The self-styled &quot;UK&apos;s greatest movie blog&quot; was set up by 18-year-old Londoner Charlie Lyne, and features trailers, reviews and gossip for all the latest movies. Written in a chatty style with no shortage of strong opinions that don&apos;t run with the herd \u2013 he gave Inglourious Basterds a firm thumbs-up. High point so far Being recognised as a serious critic and getting on the list for all the advance free screenings. In his own words &quot;There was no grand design when I started blogging 18 months ago; I just wrote about music, film and lifestyle. But as I got into it, I concentrated on film because that&apos;s what really interests me. For ages no one read it, but then I got noticed by the national press, worked on my design and promotion and used search engine optimisation tools and get roughly 30,000 unique hits a month. &quot;I&apos;m fairly neutral about my age. I never mentioned it when I started out because it didn&apos;t seem important, but I&apos;ve never gone out of my way to conceal it. I know there&apos;s a danger some people will think a teenager hasn&apos;t got anything much of value to say about film, but I hope that people will just judge the opinions and the writing on their own merits. However, I can&apos;t see myself doing this indefinitely. I&apos;m about to go to art school and my real aim is to be a director, not a critic.&quot; Matt Benson, trend spotter Blog Better Never Than Late (BNTL) (betterneverthanlate.blogspot.com)This music and fashion &quot;platform blog&quot;, run by 20-something Matt Benson and pals, showcases the best young bloggers in London. With its eclectic mix of photos, clips and grime reviews, you have to be an achingly hip teenager just to know what the hell&apos;s going on. High point so far Running its own club nights and getting advertising revenue from mainstream companies such as Uniqlo and Size? In his own words &quot;The site started off three years ago as a bunch of friends blogging about things we were interested in. Now we get 60,000 unique hits per month, but we&apos;re even more influential than those stats suggest as our readers tend to be at the forefront of what&apos;s going on in London; the ones most likely to shape future trends. &quot;We recently turned BNTL into a limited company; it&apos;s definitely turning into more of a business, but we&apos;ve kept our editorial independence and sense of what matters to us. After all, we&apos;re basically a bunch of ordinary teenage kids doing stuff we enjoy, and it&apos;s that experience people want to be part of.&quot; Angelique, student confessor Blog Raining Noodles (raining-noodles.blogspot.com)A witty, well-written confessional on everything from this semi-anonymous 20-year-old&apos;s course work in Singapore to the state of her hamster&apos;s health. Angelique promotes nothing, has no specialist axe to grind. Raining Noodles is her emotional piggy bank. High point so far Winning Best Teen Weblog in 2006 and 2007 in the annual international Bloggies awards. In her own words &quot;I&apos;m in Singapore, unfortunately in law school. I try to maintain as much anonymity as I can (am not particularly fond of stalkers) so don&apos;t know why I go by my real first name online. I never had a real desire to write until I started blogging; then suddenly realised that I, a completely common commoner with zero superhero powers, had the capacity to weave stories in different threads and colours. &quot;I try to make my writing as personal as I can \u2013 but also respect the people around me: if they request that I do not write about them, I don&apos;t.

In the diplomatic service, which he joined in\u00a01945, he\u00a0rose\u00a0to be ambassador in\u00a0Bonn and\u00a0then Washington. There was something of the actor about him. His dark good looks and five o&apos;clock shadow seemed to suggest the stage, or politics, rather than the public service. Indeed, he was thought to have a physical resemblance to Richard Nixon. He was one of those rare diplomats of whom British politicians of both major parties thought highly. As a senior official in Whitehall and as an ambassador, he served Labour governments in the late 1970s and then, after his retirement, was invited by the Conservative government to resume service in 1982, when he was appointed ambassador to the US. I was a contemporary of Wright \u2013 who was born in London and educated at\u00a0Solihull school and Christ&apos;s College, Cambridge \u2013 but I did not get to know him well until he became assistant private secretary to the foreign secretary in 1960. By then, he was a senior first secretary, having served in widely differing posts \u2013 New York, Bucharest, Singapore, Berlin and Pretoria \u2013 before spending a year at the Imperial Defence College in London. His superiors had given him consistently good reports and he had won particular praise for his facility in drafting speeches or lectures. This was one of the tasks which he performed as assistant private secretary to Lord Home, then foreign secretary, whose confidence he quickly won and who promoted him to be his principal private secretary three years later. In 1963 Sir Alec Douglas-Home, as he had by then become, took Wright to 10 Downing Street when he succeeded Harold Macmillan as prime minister. When Harold Wilson won the 1964 election, Wright had expected \u2013 and so had the Foreign Office \u2013 that Wilson would want to make a change, especially in view of Wright&apos;s close involvement with Home over several years. Instead, Wilson decided to keep him on, having recognised his ability and suitability. When he left No 10 after a couple of\u00a0years, he was rewarded with the Danish embassy at what was then considered the very early age of 45. Undoubtedly, Wright&apos;s tours of duty in the private office at the Foreign Office and then at No 10 were what turned his career from respectable to outstanding. These jobs brought him into contact with all the leading politicians of the day, and most of them recognised his merit. Furthermore, he managed to reconcile his loyalty to his political masters with his loyalties to the Foreign Office, at both the political and the official level. Having served successfully as ambassador in Copenhagen, Wright was destined to spend the rest of his career in key posts in London, western Europe and Washington. He did a short stint as the senior official dealing with Northern Ireland in 1969 before occupying one of\u00a0the most demanding of posts, known traditionally as chief clerk, in which he was responsible for the personnel and administration of the diplomatic service both at home and abroad. He then moved on to the post of\u00a0deputy under-secretary of state, supervising the European departments of the Foreign Office. Britain had just joined the EEC, so Wright&apos;s involvement with European affairs \u2013 in effect acting as what was subsequently known as political director, attempting to co-ordinate the foreign policies of the nine member states \u2013 was of crucial importance. It was natural that after this he should be given one of the major embassies, and Bonn in 1975 was seen as his obvious destination. There he succeeded Nicholas Henderson, not an easy act to follow, but one that he performed with considerable style. In\u00a0his five years in Germany he got to know the country&apos;s leaders exceptionally well at a time when Germany was becoming increasingly influential within the European community. He retired in 1981 and returned to Britain. But it was not for long. Just before his retirement, Wright had been approached by the fellows of Christ&apos;s College, who had decided to appoint as their next master a non-academic who would be a man of standing in the wider world. Wright was delighted to\u00a0accept this suggestion. He was elected an honorary fellow of the college in 1981 and pre-elected as master in 1982. But within a few months he was asked by the foreign secretary to resume his diplomatic career as ambassador to the US. He found this request irresistible. Earlier in his service he had hoped for the Washington embassy for which, by experience and personality, he was well suited. To be given the job after retirement, in preference not only to younger members of the service but also to any politician who might aspire to it, was the most unexpected and gratifying compliment. There was disappointment at Christ&apos;s College, but the fellows readily understood that Wright could not possibly have refused the offer and they released him with regret but with goodwill. He served in Washington until\u00a01986. In his second retirement, Wright was active for five years in various honorary appointments. He was King of\u00a0Arms of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George from 1987 to 1997. He also joined the board of the British Council and became a trustee of the British Museum and of the International Shakespeare Globe Centre. He and his wife, Marjory, whom he married in 1942 and who survives him, along with three sons, continued to take a close interest in the theatre and in local and national affairs until an advanced age. \u2022 John Oliver Wright, diplomat, born 6\u00a0March 1921; died 1 September 2009 Sir Alan Campbell died in 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/10/ftse-100-buoyant-economic-recovery", "sentences": ["Tokyo&apos;s Nikkei closed up 1.95% at 10,513.67 while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was up 2% at 21,267.51 and Singapore&apos;s Straits Times rose 1.58% to 2692.48."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-10T07:46:00Z", "title": "FTSE 100 stays in buoyant mood", "tags": ["FTSE", "Economic recovery", "Retail industry", "Morrisons", "Home Retail", "Global economy", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "The London stockmarket pushed further above the 5000 level this morning, following gains in Asia, buoyed by expectations that the economic recovery is taking hold.

If the opening scene from Life During Wartime, the new film from writer-director Todd Solondz, rings distant bells, that&apos;s because it is a carbon copy of the first scene from his 1998 masterpiece, Happiness. The film that follows is a quasi-sequel. Quasi because it recasts the old roles with fresh actors; quasi because its tone is rather different. Happiness was like a bomb going off. Life During Wartime is a clean-up operation, a casualty report. One might even see it as a penance as well. Solondz is in Venice for the film festival, and we are supposed to meet on a beach-front terrace. It is early evening and the terrace is awash with the Venetian elite: high-rollers and riverboat gamblers, molls and divas. Then in walks Solondz like an emissary from Planet Nerd with his thick specs and sloping shoulders and his welter of droll and drawling apologies (&quot;Sorry I&apos;m late. I got lorrst. I&apos;m a little bit lorrst&quot;). Sometimes when chewing over a question, he will respond with a non-committal whine \u2013 an elongated &quot;Nyeeah&quot; that is neither yes or no. The noise makes him sound like the venue&apos;s other, uninvited guests: the mosquitoes that drift back and forth across the terrace, discreetly snacking on its clientele. Like them, Solondz draws blood \u2013 and never more so than on Happiness. This pitch-black affair starred Philip Seymour Hoffman as a lonesome schlub who makes nuisance phone-calls and Jon Lovitz as an employee whose suicide goes largely unnoticed by his indifferent co-workers. Most notoriously, it showcased an extraordinary performance from Dylan Baker as Bill, a loving father who just happens to like doping his 11-year-old son&apos;s classmates in order to rape them. The film was loved and loathed in equal measure. Where some saw an acid comedy of American mores, others detected something altogether more queasy: a befouled gallery of grotesques in which the paedophile comes touted as the most decent and sympathetic exhibit. Life During Wartime revisits this menagerie 10 years on. Bill (now played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) is just out of jail and keen to make peace with his estranged family, while Joy (Shirley Henderson) is still strumming her guitar and lamenting her troubles with men. It is a film full of barbed jokes and taboo subjects, and yet this time the mood is more reflective, more compassionate, and more quietly condemnatory of the man at its centre. Solondz explains that he never intended to make a sequel. Then one day he sat down and found himself writing (or rewriting) that opening exchange in the New York restaurant. &quot;I don&apos;t know why I did it,&quot; he groans, as though this is the dumbest question in the world. &quot;Why do you do anything? Characters beckon. I wrote that first scene and said, &apos;Oh yeah, now let&apos;s see where it goes.&apos; And then it builds on itself and you&apos;re at the end.&quot; As simple as that? &quot;Nyeeah,&quot; says Solondz. &quot;I remember with Happiness, a lot of people saying they found the Dylan Baker character to be sympathetic and I always took issue with that word. I didn&apos;t like accepting that, because I could never sympathise with someone who would do that to a child. I think paedophilia is a monstrous affliction that we all, on a reflexive level, reject and loathe. And yet, although this man may be a monster, he still has a heart that beats. That&apos;s the idea that I was exploring on Happiness, and exploration is very different from sympathy. But,&quot; he adds, &quot;I figured I needed to clarify that a little.&quot; Maybe it also reflects a change in the director himself. Solondz was still in his 30s when he shot Happiness. He is now pushing 50; older, wiser and with new responsibilities. At this year&apos;s event, he has apparently been spotted pushing a baby buggy outside his hotel. &quot;Nyeeah,&quot; he winces. &quot;Although I wasn&apos;t a father when I wrote the script. But sure, we all get older and our experiences change. I couldn&apos;t make Happiness now, even if I wanted to. It would be a very different movie.&quot; At least some things remain reassuringly the same. Life During Wartime, like its predecessor, is a brilliant diagnosis of a certain strain of American loneliness. It shows the solitude of shopping malls and new-build condos; the anguish of characters locked within their own private prisons. Solondz agrees that he has always been drawn to this world. &quot;Sad stories move me,&quot; he says. &quot;But I still like to play. Without the irony and humour, life would be unbearable.&quot; You could say that Solondz cuts a lonely figure himself these days. Perhaps he is even, as he puts it, &quot;a little bit lorrst&quot;. His 1995 debut, Welcome to the Dollhouse, established him as a leading light of 1990s indie cinema, and Happiness made him a star. But his later films, Storytelling and Palindromes, struggled to find a wider audience. In the meantime, the business of making movies has not grown any easier. The last time I met him, a few years back, he spent a long time kvetching about all of this. Film-making, he said, was an awful hassle. He hated it. He would rather go back to teaching. Today, it transpires, this is largely what he&apos;s done. The director now conducts regular courses at New York University and recently spent six months working with students in Singapore. &quot;NYU film school has set up a branch there, like McDonalds,&quot; he explains wryly. &quot;It&apos;s a branding thing; they&apos;re going all round the world. But it gets complicated in somewhere like Abu Dhabi. If you have an Israeli student, how does he go to college in an Arab country? Or if a student is gay, how do you deal with that? And what they do, which is interesting, is that they say you can do whatever you like while you&apos;re on the campus. But when you leave the campus, you get hanged.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;It is a great intercultural exchange.&quot; At this point a Venetian high-roller appears at the table and demands that the director stand up to have his picture taken. &quot;Nyeeah,&quot; he replies in an agony of embarrassment. &quot;Can we just wait until the end of the interview?&quot; His visit to Venice means that autumn term will start a little late this year. &quot;But I enjoy teaching,&quot; he tells me. &quot;There is no stress. The students are great. Making movies is a nightmare. It&apos;s all about time management and stamping out brush fires. With this one, I&apos;m just lucky I got it made and wasn&apos;t sued. I guess that means it&apos;s a success.&quot; So the director sits at his table, staring at the sea and pondering the futility of the world. Then, all at once, a change comes over him. He affects a smile so broad it is almost farcical. &quot;But look,&quot; he says. &quot;Here we are. It&apos;s the Venice film festival. And as difficult as directing is, I do take pleasure from it. I&apos;m here, I did it, it&apos;s great. We speak the language of privilege and luxury and I don&apos;t take any of that for granted. So I just have to focus on all the wonderful things.&quot; Like right here? This very moment? Solondz nods eagerly, and then looks around. His gaze strays across the preening gamblers in their dinner-jackets and the peacock women in their sheer dresses. He sees the full, lavish spread of the beachfront terrace where the mosquitoes work the tables. &quot;Nyeeah,&quot; he says. &quot;Nyeeah.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/10/olympic-games-sport-england", "sentences": ["&quot;This government is entirely failing to build on the opportunities which London 2012 provides and seems to have no idea how to create the legacy for sport we promised when we won the bid in Singapore,&quot; said the Tory shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-10T21:30:38Z", "title": "Government's 2012 Olympics claims are hollow, say opposition MPs", "tags": ["Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Opposition MPs yesterday accused the government of failing to deliver on its Olympic sporting legacy promises after &quot;disastrous&quot; new Sport England figures revealed participation in both codes of rugby, gymnastics, rowing and six other sports fell in the last year. The new quarterly figures, which showed that just three sports \u2013 athletics, canoeing and cycling \u2013 had recorded an increase in the number of people participating at least once a week and that the rest had remained static, were immediately seized on by those who claim the government&apos;s strategy is failing. It was partly the promise to increase by two million by 2012 the 6.8m people playing sport or doing some form of physical exercise for 30 minutes three times a week that helped win the Games for London. &quot;These disastrous figures show the government&apos;s Olympic legacy strategy is going badly wrong. Many sports which have had huge funding increases are actually witnessing a decline in participation,&quot; said Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat shadow culture, media and sport secretary. &quot;There are also worrying drops in participation among women and the disabled \u2013 two of the government&apos;s target groups.&quot; Sport England and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport argue that a new strategy to funnel \u00a3480m into grassroots sport through governing bodies in the four years to 2013 has not had enough time to take effect and point to the fact that sports funding doubled in the three years to 2008. And it says top-line figures that show that the number of adults playing sport for 30 minutes for more than three times a week \u2013 the means by which the &quot;legacy promises&quot; will be measured \u2013 have increased to 6.9m. But the quarterly tracking figures measuring participation once a week on a sport-by-sport basis show that golf, gymnastics, movement and dance, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, sailing, snow sports, swimming and volleyball all showed a &quot;statistically significant&quot; decline when compared to the previous year. &quot;This government is entirely failing to build on the opportunities which London 2012 provides and seems to have no idea how to create the legacy for sport we promised when we won the bid in Singapore,&quot; said the Tory shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson. &quot;The fact that swimming participation overall has fallen only goes to prove that the free swimming initiative, which was the centrepiece of the government&apos;s sport legacy plans, has failed abysmally.&quot; Earlier this year, organisations including the British Olympic Association and the Central Council of Physical Recreation, which represents hundreds of governing bodies, said they had concerns that the promised legacy in terms of sports participation and new venues was being squandered. To achieve its target, Sport England must boost the 6.8m people playing sport for 30 minutes at least three times a week by one million. The other one million, to be delivered through other government agencies including the National Health Service, must be doing some form of physical activity for 30 minutes at least three times a week. That too came in for criticism when it emerged that activities such as decorating and &quot;active conservation&quot; would be included in the total. &quot;We are at the start of a four-year period that will see \u00a3480m invested in 46 sports to get more people playing and enjoying sport,&quot; said a Sport England spokesman. &quot;This latest snapshot covers only the first four months of this period \u2026 &quot; Sport England argues that the quarterly survey is merely a guide and that the next annual survey, due in December, will give a clearer idea of progress under a plan launched earlier this year to invest the bulk of its lottery and public funds directly through sport governing bodies. A DCMS spokesman added: &quot;Participation in sport in the last year has gone up. The figures from Sport England show an increase in the last nine months of approaching 90,000, building on a rise in the previous two years of half a million. We recognise that turning round the global trend towards inactivity is a big challenge for us all \u2013 but we have a strategy in place that is well-funded and delivering results, including over 4.4m free visits to local pools as part of the government&apos;s free swimming initiative.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/11/nelson-piquet-renault-singapore-fia-evidence", "sentences": ["Renault and the FIA yesterday refused to comment on reports that Nelson Piquet Jr told world motor sport&apos;s governing body that he was asked by his team to crash deliberately during last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix to help his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, to victory."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-10T23:10:03Z", "title": "Nelson Piquet says he was ordered by Renault to crash in Singapore", "tags": ["Formula One", "Renault", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Renault and the FIA yesterday refused to comment on reports that Nelson Piquet Jr told world motor sport&apos;s governing body that he was asked by his team to crash deliberately during last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix to help his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, to victory.

In it the Brazilian driver is said to have alleged that Renault&apos;s team principal, Flavio Briatore, and director of engineering, Pat Symonds, asked him shortly before the race to crash after Alonso made an surprisingly early refuelling stop, thus putting the Spaniard at an advantage as the rest of the field made their pit stops during the subsequent safety car period. &quot;Mr Symonds, in the presence of Mr Briatore, asked me if I would be willing to sacrifice my race for the team by &apos;causing a safety car&apos;,&quot; Piquet is quoted as saying. He is further quoted: &quot;I agreed to this proposal and caused my car to hit a wall and crash during lap 13/14 of the race.&quot; The alleged statement also quotes Piquet as saying that Symonds told him to crash at the corner in question because of the absence of a crane which might otherwise have quickly removed the wrecked car and avoided the need for the safety car and the advantages that would bring to Alonso. &quot;Mr Briatore discreetly said &apos;thank you&apos; after the end of the race,&quot; the statement quotes Piquet as saying. Piquet is quoted as saying he agreed because he was in a &quot;very fragile and emotional state of mind. This state of mind was brought about by intense stress due to the fact that Mr Briatore had refused to inform me of whether or not my driver&apos;s contract would be renewed for the next racing year.&quot; Piquet was sacked by Renault last month after a sequence of poor results. Renault and the FIA refused to comment and a spokesman for Piquet said he could not confirm whether the statement was genuine. He said: &quot;We don&apos;t have any information about this. We didn&apos;t release this and we don&apos;t know what it is. I saw the supposed document on the internet but I know as much as you do about it.&quot; Alonso said yesterday that he knew nothing about any plan to affect the outcome. &quot;I&apos;m very surprised,&quot; he said. &quot;I cannot imagine this situation, so as I said, I&apos;m surprised, and it&apos;s time to think of the next grand prix because I&apos;m not spending any more time on this. For me it&apos;s not even the time to think or to pay attention to this, because it&apos;s difficult to understand all this situation and this investigation.&quot; The Brawn driver, Rubens Barrichello, said: &quot;It&apos;s quite difficult to think somebody would crash a car because he was told to. Very realistically speaking, I think it&apos;s easier to crash a Formula One car than drive a Formula One car. That&apos;s a fair point because of the amount of power and everything. It&apos;s very easy to crash the car.&quot; BMW Sauber&apos;s Nick Heidfeld said the circumstances of the race had aroused suspicion in the paddock. &quot;Immediately after the race, in the briefing, everybody who was there in the paddock had the thought it at least looked like it could have been on purpose.&quot; Renault will go before the World Motor Sport Council on 21 September. There is no precedent for a case such as this.

Both Citigroup and Credit Suisse said the Cadbury bid showed that confidence was returning to the market.

I really didn&apos;t anticipate being on pole.&quot; Sutil had the same feeling even though Giancarlo Fisichella signalled the dawn of a dramatic improvement for Force India by taking pole two weeks ago at Spa. Sutil&apos;s previous best qualifying had been seventh for his home grand prix, otherwise the German had been more familiar with the back of the grid. Although using a Mercedes engine similar to Hamilton&apos;s McLaren, the Force India does not have Kers, a serious disadvantage at the start at Monza. &quot;The car is amazing, really quick, unbelievable,&quot; Sutil said. &quot;It&apos;s such a different feeling in a car that gives you a chance. The good feeling of being a racing driver is back and being here with Lewis adds to that. After two years consistently at the back, you forget the feeling of fighting for pole and racing to win. You get the passion back and drive much easier with a smile on your face when at the front. But I must admit it&apos;s not the best feeling to have Kers cars around me at the start. We saw what happened in Belgium when my team\u2011mate lost the race.&quot; Sutil was referring to Fisichella being overhauled by Raikkonen&apos;s use of Kers at Spa, the only circuit similar to Monza in terms of requiring the cars to run minimum downforce, a set-up that suits the Force India and, to a lesser degree, the\u00a0Brawn. Fifth and sixth fastest times for Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button was an indication of the extra fuel carried by the Brawns and disguised a timely return to form for the British team as the championship enters the final five races. &quot;I&apos;m really happy with sixth position,&quot; Button said. &quot;Rubens and I have been so close on lap times all weekend and he&apos;s ended up just fifteen-hundredths ahead of me, which is the difference between getting your head down on the straights [to reduce aerodynamic drag at 205\u00a0mph]. I obviously didn&apos;t do it enough! &quot;We got the best out of the car today and it felt good on the heavy fuel load, which is important because it&apos;s not just about qualifying, you have to consider your race. It&apos;s been a positive day and I&apos;m confident that we can have a good race.&quot; It has been a while since Button exuded such confidence at the end of qualifying, the leader of the championship poised to make the most of a one-stop strategy while the front three drivers stop twice. A pit stop at Monza can cost up to 28 seconds from leaving the track to rejoining. &quot;Rubens and Jenson drove extremely well with our chosen one-stop strategy to secure fifth and sixth positions,&quot; Ross Brawn said. &quot;The closeness of their lap times shows that they achieved everything possible from the car. We have the majority of the Kers cars just ahead of us so, provided our drivers get a good start, there is everything to play for in the race.&quot; Button will also have been heartened by Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber struggling to match the pace of their championship rivals. The Red Bull pair have been restricted in mileage by Renault engine failures, which have eaten into the allocation of eight engines per driver for the season. The use of a ninth engine will bring a 10-place grid penalty. &quot;We&apos;ll see how the strategy pans out,&quot; Webber said. &quot;We&apos;ve got to try and grab everything we can now. I&apos;m pretty happy with the job I did today but we&apos;re just lacking a bit of pace. We&apos;ll do what we can and salvage something from 10th \u2013 it&apos;s certainly possible.&quot; Depending which forecast you read, today&apos;s race could be similar to last year&apos;s and run in the rain. Vettel was unbeatable after starting from pole. Given Hamilton&apos;s record in wet conditions, the world champion is in the perfect position to win before the sport returns to less attractive business away from the race track."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/13/freedom-for-sale-john-kampfner", "sentences": ["His more amorphous target is the anaesthetised freedom of the city state of his birth, Singapore, and the insidious spread of Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s model democracy \u2013 not just to Malaysia, but on to Beijing and beyond.", "But Singapore has slyly inserted another level of choice."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-12T23:00:01Z", "title": "Freedom for Sale by John Kampfner | Book review", "tags": ["Politics", "Books", "Culture", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Somehow, as the last millennium began to turn up its toes, Winston Churchill&apos;s &quot;least worst&quot; system of government became a quasi-religion for those who worshipped shining cities on hills. Democracy, loosely defined, had slain the red dragon of Marxism. Henceforth, St George Bush could launch his crusades against the infidel (waging more wars to end wars). Ballot boxes possessed the supposed power to deliver peace, harmony and full partnership in global growth. They magically separated the good guys from the bad guys. But now, much assisted by John Kampfner&apos;s acidulous essays in autocratic reality, we can all wake up. Kampfner, political journalist turned human rights campaigner, isn&apos;t dealing here with the shambles of Afghanistan. His more amorphous target is the anaesthetised freedom of the city state of his birth, Singapore, and the insidious spread of Lee Kuan Yew&apos;s model democracy \u2013 not just to Malaysia, but on to Beijing and beyond. Can you have economic success without political freedom? The Bush and Blair camps would probably answer no, with a windy rhetorical flourish. Capitalism depends on the market and the market depends on human beings (aka consumers) exercising free choice. But Singapore has slyly inserted another level of choice. It has made what Kampfner calls &quot;a pact&quot; with its citizenry. You can accrete wealth and trappings, eat good food, live in fine houses and enjoy a &quot;good&quot; life: just don&apos;t rock our boat. It&apos;s a covert deal intended to keep everyone happy. It offers those who&apos;ve made it the ability to keep it. It gives new generations of loyal citizens the prospect that they, too, can grow rich and contented. The price \u2013 a certain quiescence \u2013 doesn&apos;t seem so high by the side of a swimming pool. What alternative is there? Utter a word out of place and you&apos;ll be sued, banned or taxed out of existence. Play the game and the world smiles with you. Free choice can mean choosing not to get involved. There&apos;s one further factor that Kampfner shrewdly pops into this pot: simple fear, as in terror of chaos. Lee Kuan Yew, like his disciples in Kuala Lumpur, trades on fear of communal violence. Beijing has centuries of civil war and imploding dynasties to shiver the timbers of its fledgling tycoons. Vladimir Putin, offering order against the drunken debacles of the Yeltsin era, adds Moscow to the list. And so, from India to Berlusconi&apos;s Italy, to Brown&apos;s phone-tapping Britain, we see true freedoms under attack, fading, dying. It is a pungent thesis, argued with verve and an abundance of telling detail. Maybe the force diminishes as we reach Obama, because he doesn&apos;t (yet) fit. Maybe the shock of the new blinds Kampfner to the grot of the old. Was there ever a golden age when Labour in office served all of the people all of the time? And Kampfner&apos;s habit of parading his travel schedules in the present tense \u2013 like Alan Whicker playing John Pilger \u2013 gets irritating. But none of this diminishes the fundamental questions of Freedom for Sale, often posed with a clarity that makes you wince. We in the west still swagger over a cold war won; we still see, if not the end of history, then a dividing line with grim things past; we still employ the verbiage of liberation, hope and achievement. Has the crunch squeezed all of that out of us? No, not quite. Business as usual remains somewhere on the back of the menu. But what does it amount to? Government by some of the people for some of the people (the ones who matter). Election by clique, twist and fiddle. Lip service to public service. And fear rippling onwards, as rationale or excuse. Where will this cowardly new world go when the threat is real? Is there a strong man who will bust through the facade of freedom and construct a rescue pact? It&apos;s where John Kampfner&apos;s grisly logic takes us next, one more reason to read and flinch.

The end game of Formula One&apos;s latest scandal \u2013regardless of who said what to whom during the alleged plot to make Nelson Piquet deliberately crash out \u2013 is the enforced resignation of the Renault team principal. The plethora of leaked documents and vitriolic statements boils down to which side is to be believed before the FIA World Motor Sport Council investigate the matter a week tomorrow. Did Piquet&apos;s accident, which paved the way to victory for his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, come about through prearranged instruction from Briatore and his director of engineering, Pat Symonds? Or was it through either incompetence by the driver or unilateral action designed to curry favour and ensure his continuing employment? The only certainty is that the matter was raised during the usual pre-race briefing between driver and team. Piquet says he was asked to stage the incident at a particular corner on a pre-arranged lap. Renault claim Piquet made the suggestion, but it was quickly dismissed. Regardless of the source, the end result was dramatic as Piquet spun and wrote off the right-hand side of the Renault against a concrete wall, a potentially harmful crash even allowing for the car&apos;s in-built safety standards. It was as if Piquet, having made several mistakes during previous race weekends, got this wrong too as he tried to clip the barrier on the right but missed it and spun with great force into the wall on the left. Piquet appeared to have a dress rehearsal when he spun under strange circumstances while on his way to the starting grid, an incident that was dismissed at the time as simply another indiscretion by the struggling Brazilian. Piquet and Renault are adamant in their claims of innocence, Briatore taking particular offence at the alleged claim by the driver and his father that they would blackmail the team if, as happened last month, Piquet Jr&apos;s contract was broken. Briatore has dismissed as an oversimplification the claim that Piquet&apos;s crash, by bringing on the safety car, handed the race to Alonso, who happened to have been alone among the 20 starters to have made his first refuelling stop a few laps before the crash. Briatore points out that, but for a misunderstanding by Ferrari that led to Felipe Massa leaving the pits prematurely and dragging the fuel hose with him, the Brazilian would have won the race (and, in all probability, the world championship). Inducing a safety period is nothing new, particularly on oval racing in the United States where drivers, running low on fuel in the closing stages of a race, have been known to throw a specially prepared piece of foam from the cockpit and cause debris on the track. There have been other instances of drivers choosing tricky locations to deliberately stall their cars and provoke the appearance of a safety car at an opportune moment for their team\u2011mate. Motor sport is no more immune to the professional foul than any other sport. The difference this time is that the accident had the potential to put other drivers, and perhaps spectators, at risk given the amount of damage caused by the wayward Renault. In the light of recent incidents, one fatal, involving flying debris from crashed cars, the FIA will have no option but to come down heavily on the individuals involved if they are found responsible. Given that McLaren were fined $100m and removed from the 2007 Constructors&apos; Championship for their involvement in a spy scandal with Ferrari, a minor offence compared to the Singapore charges, the guilty party could face a lengthy ban. Which brings us back to Briatore. Rubens Barrichello perhaps came close to the truth on Thursday when he said: &quot;It seems someone wants Briatore&apos;s head.&quot; When discussing the case, Bernie Ecclestone also hinted that Briatore would take the rap if found culpable. &quot;Let&apos;s assume what is being assumed is correct,&quot; said Ecclestone. &quot;You can&apos;t blame Renault \u2013 it&apos;s nothing to do with Renault. It&apos;s a small group.&quot; Briatore is said to be as unpopular in certain high places as was Ron Dennis, absent from F1 since the conclusion of the McLaren affair at the beginning of the season. If guilty, Briatore could have engineered his farewell to F1 as well as a surprise win in Singapore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/italian-grand-prix-rubens-barrichello", "sentences": ["For the next race, the car should be much better and we&apos;ll be back up there.&quot; The 14th round of the championship will be the Singapore grand prix on 27 September."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-13T20:25:46Z", "title": "Rubens Barrichello takes full advantage of Lewis Hamilton crashing out", "tags": ["Formula One", "Brawn", "Lewis Hamilton", "Jenson Button", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "When Jenson Button returned to the Brawn team carrying the trophy for finishing second in yesterday&apos;s Italian grand prix, he received such a rousing cheer that it was if the Briton had won the race rather than his team-mate Rubens Barrichello. The effusive welcome and Button&apos;s broad grin said everything about a result that proved Brawn had returned to winning ways as well as reviving Button&apos;s flagging championship momentum. That Barrichello had strengthened his position as Button&apos;s main title rival was seen as a bonus rather than a problem as the season moves into its final phase of four races. The Brawn one-two had been perfectly executed despite Barrichello and Button starting from fifth and sixth on the grid. Rather than attempt to take on the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s Ferrari with their Kers power-boost, Brawn had opted to qualify with plenty of fuel on board to allow a one-stop strategy. The only serious obstacle in Brawn&apos;s way appeared to be Heikki Kovalainen, who had produced an outstanding lap to qualify fourth while also preparing to stop just once. Kovalainen made a poor start, was immediately overhauled by Barrichello while Button bravely sat it out with the McLaren through the 90mph Lesmo corner halfway round the first lap. That done, the Brawn drivers then had to stay in touch with Hamilton, Raikkonen and the Force India of Adrian Sutil, all of whom were due to stop twice. True to form, Hamilton had made a perfect start and produced a succession of fastest race laps as he tried to build up a big enough gap over the Brawns. When Hamilton made his first stop on lap 15, it was clear his 17-second lead over Barrichello in fourth place would not be enough. When Raikkonen and Sutil stopped a few laps later, the Brawns eased to the head of the field before making their one and only stops on laps 28 and 29. Hamilton moved back in front but knew his second stop on lap 34 would allow Barrichello and Button to regain the lead. Hamilton did not give up and closed to within two seconds of Button. Hamilton covered the first sector of the final lap faster than any driver had gone before. But, when he put a wheel on a kerb at Lesmo, the McLaren spun into a tyre barrier. Despite a heavy impact, the world champion was unhurt. &quot;I&apos;m built like a rock,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;I had to push really hard to make our strategy work. I got every tenth [of a second] out of the car I could possibly get and didn&apos;t make any mistakes until the last lap. I don&apos;t know what happened. Everything seemed to be fine and then all of a sudden the back end snapped out. We&apos;re not challenging for a world championship, so that makes it more acceptable even though you obviously don&apos;t want to crash like that. &quot;These things happen and I apologised to the team. My job is togo as hard as I can every single lap and that&apos;s what I did. We weren&apos;t quick enough this weekend but I did all I could to catch the Brawns.&quot; The Brawn drivers had been keeping an eye on each other as well as Hamilton. Button knew his race strategy would be compromised from the moment Barrichello had qualified ahead and won the option to run one lap longer before the pit stops. Button was less than two seconds behind when he made his stop but Barrichello, who had won this race twice before when driving for Ferrari, made no mistakes from start to finish. Barrichello&apos;s only concern had been the reliability of a gearbox which has to last for four races but which was damaged at the start of the previous grand prix in Belgium. &quot;The gearbox was great in the end,&quot; said Barrichello. &quot;When I had problems with my start at Spa, too much torque had gone through the box and this could cause long-term damage. The team offered to change it but this would have meant a five-place grid penalty. I wasn&apos;t going to give up fifth on the grid and I just had to hope it would be OK. &quot;I made a good start and I had to defend myself from Kovalainen, who was coming up quite fast with his Kers on the McLaren. It was very important to keep him behind me. After that, I knew we were looking good. Then to have the Red Bulls not do well was a bonus at the end of a fantastic day.&quot; Mark Webber&apos;s Red Bull was eliminated by a collision on the first lap while his team-mate, Sebastian Vettel, scored a point by finishing eighth. &quot;I was struggling with low grip,&quot; said Vettel. &quot;I was sliding a lot and lost a lot of time. Overall, we didn&apos;t have the speed. The championship isn&apos;t over.

The boss of household goods group Reckitt Benckiser has pocketed more than \u00a380m over the past three years. A notorious workaholic who rarely gives interviews, he lives in a mansion overlooking a prestigious golf course in Sunningdale, Berkshire. Behind Becht&apos;s income is a record of delivering profits consistently ahead of rivals such as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, although Reckitt shares declined last year and investors have pressed for his rewards to be curbed. Another feature of Becht&apos;s deal is its generosity in relation to those of his colleagues: the \u00a336.8m he took home last year accounts for 84% of the company&apos;s entire boardroom remuneration and is equivalent to 5.7% of the total wage bill for Reckitt&apos;s 24,300 strong workforce. Despite fears Reckitt would lose sales for its premium-priced brands as the global downturn set in, Becht has continued to beat growth targets. The performance gap between Reckitt and the rest of the sector has widened, triggering a 65% leap in Becht&apos;s pay package for 2008, a year when the company reported a 25% rise in net revenues to \u00a36.56bn. Becht rarely gives interviews, but said several years ago: &quot;A high profile normally goes with taking the credit and that would send the wrong messages. This is not a one-man show.&quot; Aidan Heavey Tullow Oil&apos;s chief executive and founder, Aidan Heavey, may need some help managing the \u00a328.8m he made last year. A former financial controller for Aer Lingus, he once admitted that he was a &quot;crap accountant&quot;. Heavey joined Tullow Engineering in 1981, a small family-owned firm based near Dublin. The firm had a subsidiary, Tullow Oil, running fuel oil tankers. Heavey decided to buy out the subsidiary, relaunching the company in 1985 as an oil-producing company with horizons far beyond the shores of Ireland. He got the idea after being tipped off by a banker who told him that the world was littered with valuable oil fields that were ignored by big companies because they were too small. Heavey plumped for Senegal to base his new venture, even though he was not entirely sure where it was. He mortgaged himself up to the hilt and sold his collection of vintage cars to raise the cash for the new company. Today, Tullow Oil has a market valuation of $13bn (\u00a37.8bn), is a member of the FTSE 100 and is the largest independent oil company in Britain. It operates in 22 countries. Tullow Oil&apos;s big gamble came in 2004 when it bought Energy Africa. The deal doubled the company&apos;s size and gave it a large presence in Africa. Tullow&apos;s results last year were as spectacular as Heavey&apos;s bulging pay packet. He cashed in \u00a324m in share options and received \u00a33m in awards vesting under the company&apos;s share-based long-term incentive plan, as well as his \u00a3640,500 basic salary. Last year the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3299m, up 162% on the previous year, helped by a record oil price. Profits for the first half of this year were predictably much more modest after a collapse in the oil price. But the firm maintained its dividend. Heavey still owns 0.8% of Tullow Oil, worth more than $100m. Charles Goodyear Like comedy, one secret to making a fortune is timing. And by judging his departure as the chief executive of BHP Billiton, the world&apos;s biggest mining company, to perfection, Charles Goodyear hit the jackpot last year. Goodyear, better known as Chip, banked \u00a323.8m when he retired early, triggering his pension, and allowing him to cash in on long term incentive plans and share options, on top of his base salary of \u00a33.7m. What makes Goodyear&apos;s departure especially astute is that after his exit, the fortunes of BHP Billiton, which he had built up, went into reverse. When he left, BHP was riding high on the back of surging commodity prices driven by demand from China. But the market subsequently fell sharply as would Goodyear&apos;s fortune if he stayed at the firm. Goodyear quietly surfed the global commodity boom, which saw his company&apos;s profits and shares rocket. His term of office saw him regularly scoop 20% pay rises. But the scion of US lumber and rubber barons faced disputes with workers who took action when they were offered pay rises of just 1.5%. A keep fit fanatic, Goodyear left BHP to work at the powerful Singapore sovereign wealth fund, Temasek, where it was assumed he was being groomed to be its first foreign chief executive. His brief was to restore the fund&apos;s fortunes after it was hit by the financial crisis but disagreements over strategy led to him quitting in July. After studying at Yale and then Wharton business school, Goodyear became a Wall Street investment banker with Kidder Peabody. He moved into mining with a job at copper producer Freeport-McMoRan, and joined Australian miner BHP as chief financial officer in 1999. Goodyear was one of the team that spearheaded BHP&apos;s merger with Billiton of South Africa in 2001. Goodyear&apos;s tenure at BHP Billiton was bookended by the shadow of industry rival Rio Tinto. It was his predecessor, Brian Gilbertson&apos;s inability to convince BHP chairman, Don Argus to mount a bid for Rio which sparked a dramatic boardroom bust up that created the opportunity for Goodyear to run the firm. And it was Goodyear&apos;s departure that allowed his prodigy and successsor, Marius Kloppers to persuade Argus to press the button on an ill-advised failed \u00a373bn tie up that failed"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/15/max-mosley-formula-one-fia", "sentences": ["Nelson Piquet Jr has alleged that, last September, he obeyed Renault team orders and deliberately crashed in order to stop the Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-14T23:05:18Z", "title": "Max Mosley: 'Retirement will be a relief.

It is an unusually mild afternoon on the shimmering French coast and, with a wry little laugh, Mosley compares the latest black hole of controversy that threatens to engulf Formula One with a mundane domestic chore from his own troubled life at home in England. &quot;My wife says it&apos;s just like housework,&quot; Mosley murmurs. &quot;It&apos;s never done. There&apos;s always something \u2026&quot; Down in the dying days of Mosley&apos;s long and contentious reign over Formula One, which will finally come to an end next month, the latest &quot;something&quot; is arguably the darkest charge yet laid against the sport. Nelson Piquet Jr has alleged that, last September, he obeyed Renault team orders and deliberately crashed in order to stop the Singapore grand prix. The safety car was brought out and, in the process, Piquet&apos;s team-mate, Fernando Alonso, gained an unfair advantage and went on to win the race. If proven, the credibility of the sport will be ruined for years \u2013 a fact Mosley acknowledges as president of the FIA, motor racing&apos;s governing body. Mosley himself has endured a traumatic 18 months. Last April the News of the World exposed his private life by splashing images of his sado-masochistic encounter with five paid women across their newspaper and the internet. Even more distressingly, his eldest son, Alexander, died from a drug overdose only four months ago. It is, therefore, unsurprising that Mosley speaks with raw emotion about his personal life \u2013 and why, despite his skills in media-manipulation, he does not attempt to dismiss the grave circumstances for Formula One. &quot;Yes,&quot; he says when asked if this is the most disturbing accusation of chicanery and deception he has yet encountered in his 18 years in charge of F1. &quot;If it turns out to be true then obviously it is very serious. It&apos;s the sort of thing we don&apos;t want \u2013 but we haven&apos;t heard the defence yet. All we&apos;ve heard so far is the &apos;prosecution&apos; and it always sounds bad when you just hear one side of the story. Sometimes these things can turn out to be very different when you hear the defence. I&apos;m genuinely keeping an open mind on it.&quot; But he was surely shocked when hearing Piquet&apos;s account? &quot;Quite,&quot; Mosley says softly. &quot;But two or three months earlier I&apos;d heard this allegation was floating around. Of course there was nothing one could do then because there was no evidence \u2013 it was all rumour. So I knew the allegation existed but, yes, I was quite surprised they were actually prepared to come forward and make it. &quot;Nelson Piquet Sr [a three-time formula one world champion and the father of the former Renault driver] came to see me in late July and said all this had happened. So I listened to him and said, &apos;well, if Nelson makes a sworn statement then obviously we&apos;ll investigate it.&apos; The father arranged for that to happen. We then started to look at all the onboard data and all the recordings we&apos;ve got of everything that happened in the car.&quot; Did the FIA&apos;s preliminary investigations support Piquet&apos;s allegations? &quot;Yes, certainly the data from the car indicated that something very unusual had happened on the corner where he crashed \u2013 according to the experts. So there was enough there to make it unthinkable not to investigate. This week Renault will send in written documents but the actual hearing of their defence is next Monday.&quot; The Piquets have been offered immunity from FIA prosecution if their full confession is proven \u2013 but Renault have since launched criminal proceedings against Nelson Jr. It would be astonishing if the Piquets were lying in the knowledge that a jail sentence could result from such perjury. &quot;It would,&quot; Mosley agrees, &quot;but on the other hand you could also say it&apos;s very unexpected a team could do something like this. Certainly in the UK it would be a criminal act.&quot; Flavio Briatore, the team principal at Renault, has the most to lose next Monday. And after some of his bitter spats with the FIA, and rival teams, the suggestion has been made that many in this seething world of fast cars and low morals would enjoy seeing Briatore take a fall. &quot;He&apos;s rung two or three times since this started,&quot; Mosley says of Briatore. &quot;He has a different point of view but we didn&apos;t really go into all the details. At Monza [where the Italian grand prix was held on Sunday] everybody was saying, &apos;Oh, this is terrible for Formula One.&apos; Well, perhaps, but it would be more terrible if we did nothing.&quot; The consequences for the sport, however, are potentially catastrophic \u2013 and recent scandals around spying and lying to race officials would seem insignificant when set against such crude cheating. If Piquet&apos;s allegations are upheld, Formula One will look far more corrupt than even Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s most vociferous critics claimed. The Formula One circus will continue next year, without Mosley, for his imminent retirement meant that the teams, led by Briatore and other principals, withdrew their threat to break away and form their own championship. Mosley, however, suggests that any triumph felt at his apparent demise should be curbed by the possibility that at least two more manufacturers might follow Honda and BMW out of the sport. &quot;The gravity has not really registered with the teams,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I&apos;ve pointed out that, if they&apos;re allied to a big car manufacturer, they can literally get a fax in the morning with a P45 to follow. But they don&apos;t believe it and it&apos;s extraordinary how they fought tooth and nail to keep the costs near the current levels. It&apos;s also surprising the main boards of the manufacturers didn&apos;t back what we were doing. They&apos;ve got factory closures and yet they&apos;re still pumping money into Formula One. In the end it dawned on me that these CEOs are under such pressure that they simply don&apos;t have the time to focus on F1. &quot;I know the feeling and that&apos;s why retirement will be a big relief. The work is absolutely non-stop and I always feel I haven&apos;t really done what I should&apos;ve done. And I am tired of the battling. It&apos;s more or less, in different guises, the same problems with the same people and you&apos;re never going to finish. At a certain point it&apos;s time to stop. I think the FIA members would re-elect me if I stood but I am getting too old [at 69]. You&apos;ve only got a limited amount of time left before you drop off \u2013 and do you really want to spend it solving other people&apos;s problems?&quot; Mosley has endured his own terrible problems. His face crumples slightly when reflecting on his 38-year-old son&apos;s death from a heroin overdose in May. &quot;These things happen,&quot; he says quietly, &quot;and I&apos;m slowly getting used to the idea. It&apos;s very sad because Alexander was someone of enormous ability and every now and then he would focus it \u2013 but then he&apos;d start the drugs again. It&apos;s such a waste. He did some interesting things in maths and economics and I got letters from people who wrote papers with him \u2013 and they really rated him. But he suffered from depression, which a lot of clever people do, so that didn&apos;t help.&quot; Alexander was with Mosley and his mother on the Sunday morning in April 2008 when the News of the World broke their salacious story. &quot;As it happened,&quot; Mosley remembers, &quot;Alexander was staying with us. When I told my wife he was around but what I remember most was her immediate reaction \u2013 that I&apos;d had a joke newspaper printed. Alexander didn&apos;t really react. That was what I would&apos;ve done if the same thing had happened to him. I would&apos;ve pretended not to make any big thing of it because he probably understood that the last thing I needed was him judging me. After that we did speak about it but it always focused on the importance of my legal action \u2013 and how his friends all hoped I&apos;d win.&quot; It&apos;s impossible to know how the public humiliation of his father affected Alexander \u2013 and Mosley looks sadly out to sea again when asked if he has forgiven himself. &quot;I&apos;ve never really seen it like that. It&apos;s a bit like drug addiction. You know, I used to have discussions with my son, who was completely rational, and we agreed that these things are beyond rationality and there is very little you can do about it. If I was unfortunate enough to do something illegal or morally wrong then I would go see a psychiatrist. But I feel it&apos;s harmless. &quot;The only people who knew about my interests were in that world. My wife didn&apos;t know. Bernie didn&apos;t know. I was very careful. I read Kenneth Tynan&apos;s biography the other day and he put it very well. When you&apos;re not in the mood [for sado-masochistic sex] it&apos;s incomprehensible. It&apos;s completely mad. But one thing I have learned is that people are hardwired this way. It&apos;s very strange. So I can&apos;t expect my wife to understand it.&quot; In his hushed office it is easier to understand how torn he felt as a father about his son&apos;s fatal addiction: &quot;Absolutely. I used to say to him, with him having done detox and got out clean, it was beyond my understanding he could pick up a drug again. And then he would explain how it happens. And of course I understood the nature of addiction.&quot; Mosley is driven now by his ongoing legal battle with the News of the World. &quot;They expected that the women I was with, and who defended me in court, would be four Lithuanian drug addicts \u2013 forced to do these ghastly things with me. But, even with the court order not to identify them, enough came out about their academic backgrounds to change people&apos;s perceptions. The strange thing is that, because there is so much in the press about the Taliban or religious extremists, people are beginning to understand that it&apos;s not up to grubby little newspapers like the News of the World or Daily Mail to do the same in England.&quot; Making some libellous comparisons between the Taliban and certain characters in British journalism, Mosley stresses his indignation: &quot;It never crossed my mind not to fight back. Without being priggish there is a dutiful aspect because these newspapers often pick on people who don&apos;t have the money or the intellectual resources to fight back. So that&apos;s why I will continue to fight them.&quot; Mosley has won his action against the News of the World&apos;s invasion of his privacy \u2013 and handed \u00a360,000 damages to charity. &quot;In Germany we have also settled and the biggest payment under their privacy laws had been made \u2013 with \u20ac200,000 [\u00a3176,000] going to charity. We&apos;ve got cases ongoing against the News of the World for publishing in France and Italy. The wheels of justice grind slowly and it might be quite disagreeable for them. But I&apos;m dying to have a bit more time for myself. There are so many books I want to read and maybe I will write a book myself \u2013 because there is so much to tell.&quot; Mosley chuckles dryly. &quot;What do they say? The devil makes work for idle hands. So it&apos;s best I keep busy. I&apos;m not quite done yet.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/15/formulaone-renault", "sentences": ["Max Mosley has said that there appears to be evidence to support Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s allegation that he deliberately crashed his car in last season&apos;s Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-14T23:13:40Z", "title": "Early evidence indicates crash was suspicious, says Max Mosley", "tags": ["Formula One", "Renault", "Max Mosley", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Max Mosley has said that there appears to be evidence to support Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s allegation that he deliberately crashed his car in last season&apos;s Singapore grand prix.

This week Renault will send in written documents but the actual hearing of their defence is next Monday.&quot; Mosley, who will retire as president of the world governing body, the FIA, at the end of October, told the Guardian that he had heard rumours of the story some months before he was approached by the driver&apos;s father, Nelson Piquet Sr. &quot;Two or three months earlier I&apos;d heard this allegation was floating around. Of course there was nothing one could do then because there was no evidence \u2013 it was all rumour and hearsay. So I knew the allegation existed but, yes, I was quite surprised they were actually prepared to come forward and make it. &quot;Nelson Piquet Sr came to see me after the Hungarian grand prix in late July and said all this had happened. So I listened to him and said, &apos;Well, if Nelson makes a sworn statement then obviously we&apos;ll investigate it.&apos; The father arranged for that to happen. We then started to look at all the onboard data and all the recordings we&apos;ve got of everything that happened in the car.&quot; Renault have responded by launching criminal proceedings against the Piquets for attempted blackmail and false allegations.

Symonds has been offered immunity from punishment by the FIA if he provides full disclosure of the facts behind the crash that paved the way for Renault&apos;s Fernando Alonso to win the race. By offering the same protection to Piquet, the sport&apos;s governing body has effectively fingered the Renault team principal, Flavio Briatore, the third party in the alleged race fix. If Symonds provides evidence that proves the incident was planned on Briatore&apos;s suggestion, it would probably mean the end in F1 for the man with whom Symonds has worked closely for more than 25 years. Briatore has said the accident was not deliberate and has taken legal action against Piquet and his father, Nelson Piquet Sr. Symonds has made no comment in public and refused to answer leading questions when the FIA held a preliminary investigation at the Belgian grand prix on 28 and 29 August. Symonds did say, however, that Piquet Jr had raised the subject of crashing deliberately during the usual pre-race briefing in Singapore, but the matter had been dismissed. A leaked report of the interviews in Belgium went on to say: &quot;Symonds suggested at his interview on 27 August that he might wish to revert to the stewards with further information, including information responsive to the various questions he had declined to answer. However, no such further information was provided on 27 August. On 28 August, Mr Symonds was summoned back before the stewards to be asked if he wanted to give further information on the questions he had declined to answer. Mr Symonds again declined to answer the questions.&quot; Judging by the offer of immunity, what Symonds might have to say on Monday is of vital importance in deciding whether Briatore or the Piquets are fabricating their stories. Briatore, by his own admission, barely knows one end of a racing car from the other. The 59-year-old Italian&apos;s speciality is marketing and deal-making, a trade he learned when working for Benetton at the height of the company&apos;s prominence in the fashion industry and before it bought the Toleman F1 team, for whom Symonds worked at the time. If Briatore did decide to influence the outcome of the Singapore race, he could not have done it without Symonds&apos;s specialised knowledge and experience. The transcript of the radio conversations at the time of the crash, also made public in a leak unprecedented even by F1&apos;s standards of sensitive documents reaching favoured media outlets, gives the impression that Briatore, in a colourful outburst about Piquet&apos;s driving, was surprised by the crash. Briatore, an extrovert character, will have been aware that all radio transmissions are monitored by the FIA. More telling is Piquet&apos;s message on lap eight when he asks: &quot;What lap are we in?&quot; A driver usually relies on his pit board to provide that sort of information. At such an early stage, with the pit stops some way off, Piquet should have been focused on racing hard as the race settled down. It was as if there was a more important agenda awaiting nine laps later. Only Briatore, Symonds and Piquet know the truth."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/sep/14/obama-free-trade-nafta", "sentences": ["Last month the government accountability office assessed the impact of Nafta-style trade agreements with Jordan, Chile, Singapore and Morocco."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-15T19:00:00Z", "title": "Fix America's trade regime | Kevin Gallagher", "tags": ["International trade", "Barack Obama", "Obama administration", "Mexico", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Global economy", "US politics", "Global development", "Politics", "Americas"], "article": "On the campaign trail, Barack Obama said: &quot;I voted against Cafta, never supported Nafta and will not support Nafta-style trade agreements in the future.&quot; The now president has released a statement saying he will unveil the administration&apos;s trade policy agenda ahead of the G20 meeting in late September. This is welcome news, given that the Obama administration has been slow to move on this pressing issue \u2013 so much so that some critics have suggested that Obama has abandoned this core campaign pledge.  As the administration rightly put top focus on Afghanistan, Iraq and healthcare, Congress has been paving the way for a comprehensive trade reform package that is now ready for the president to incorporate into his new agenda. Last month the government accountability office assessed the impact of Nafta-style trade agreements with Jordan, Chile, Singapore and Morocco. The key findings are that trade increased between the US and these partners, but labour and environmental records were poor. In Chile for example, promised US funds for labour and environmental monitoring hardly materialised and &quot;consistently stymied efforts to provide Chile FTA-related technical assistance and cooperation&quot;. The report is welcome but fails to analyse some other very important aspects of these agreements. The GAO&apos;s indicator of economic success is that trade and investment with these countries increased significantly since the agreements went into force. Mexico&apos;s experience shows that increased trade and investment may not translate into increased growth and welfare. Yet, the GAO report falls short of analysing the full impact of the agreements on growth and development. More importantly, the newly introduced Trade Reform, Accountability, Development and Employment Act (Trade Act) of 2009 would strengthen the GAO&apos;s approach by looking at the economic, environmental, labour and developmental impacts of Nafta and other recent trade agreements. What&apos;s more, the bill would put in place a process of fixing previous trade agreements and forging new ones based on the GAO assessment.  Fixing trade is too important for it to become the next healthcare gridlock. The world needs to begin trading again, and in a manner that enhances economic growth and development. According to the IMF&apos;s recent World Economic Outlook, world trade is projected to decline by 12.2% in 2009.  Closer to home, the longer our third-largest trading partner suffers, the longer we do. That would be Mexico, the nation most hard hit by Nafta and the financial crisis. Despite the fact that Mexico&apos;s exports and foreign investment close to tripled under Nafta, Mexico&apos;s economy only grew at an annual per capita rate of approximately 1.5%. Foreign investment wiped out local firms, so domestic investment slid to 19% of GDP, compared to a pre-Nafta level of 24% of GDP. This is why growth has been so poor in Mexico, say Juan Carlos Moreno-Brid and Jaime Ros in their new book Development and Growth in the Mexican Economy. And that&apos;s when the going was good. Mexico has been among the worst hit by the crisis. Industrial production has declined by over 10% this year, and the economy as a whole is projected to shrink by 7.1% despite the frantic effort to save the economy. Mexico&apos;s central bank has spent close to $30bn of its reserves to save the peso since the crisis hit. According to Bloomberg News, Mexico has been selling $50m daily and $250m when the peso weakens more than 2% in a day, as it has this week. Here in the US, Nafta is blamed for job loss, for putting pressure on wages and for increasing the trade deficit. What&apos;s more, critics decry that the investment and services provisions in Nafta-style agreements allow investors and governments to sue the US for its legislation on the environment and public health.  Consistent with his campaign promise, Obama should pledge to review Nafta and its clones, fix them where they are not working and create a new template for future agreements. With the Trade Act&apos;s initial set of over 100 co-sponsors, the president can add to the momentum fuelled by Congress on trade since he took office."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/16/flavio-briatore-pat-symonds-renault-quit-crash-singapore", "sentences": ["Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds have stepped down from their posts after Renault decided not to dispute allegations that the team ordered former driver Nelson Piquet Junior to crash deliberately at last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix.", "In a statement Renault said: &quot;The Renault team will not dispute the recent allegations made by the FIA concerning the 2008 Singapore grand prix.&quot; &quot;It also wishes to state that its managing director Flavio Briatore and its executive director of engineering Pat Symonds have left the team.", "The FIA had charged Renault with &quot;conspiring with its driver, Nelson Piquet Jnr, to cause a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore grand prix with the aim of causing the deployment of the safety car to the advantage of its other driver, Fernando Alonso.&quot;            Following the crash, which took place on a part of the circuit where no cranes were available to lift Piquet&apos;s car over the barriers, the safety car was deployed."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T11:44:10Z", "title": "Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds quit Renault over Singapore crash furore", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds have stepped down from their posts after Renault decided not to dispute allegations that the team ordered former driver Nelson Piquet Junior to crash deliberately at last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix.

Renault now look set to bow their heads and submit whatever punishment the FIA chooses to mete out to them, although the French team&apos;s parent company will be hoping that by shedding these two senior staff members they will successfully have taken the sting out of any penalties. The FIA could equally suspend the team from the world championship, although insiders believe if that were to happen then Renault might withdraw from the sport after the remaining four races of 2009.

The compensation deal for the victims of toxic oil waste dumping in west Africa \u2013 likely to be confirmed imminently \u2013 means the full extent of attempts to cover up what really happened can be spelled out for the first time. The truth is laid bare in Trafigura&apos;s hitherto secret documents, published by the Guardian today. The company&apos;s internal emails show the true nature of the toxic waste dumped around Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast. Trafigura had publicly claimed the waste was harmless. The exposure of the company files has contributed to Trafigura&apos;s climbdown after three years of bitterly contested legal battles. We are publishing them online today. Martyn Day is a senior partner at the British law firm Leigh Day, which has brought one of the biggest group actions in legal history, seeking damages of \u00a3100m. He said today in Abidjan, where he has been negotiating the settlement: &quot;The claimants are very pleased.&quot; He was in the process of putting a global deal to the victims, he said. &quot;The sum being discussed is based on the range of short-term symptoms claimed by our clients.&quot; Thousands of west Africans besieged local hospitals, and a number died, in 2006 after the dumping of hundreds of tons of highly toxic oil waste around Abidjan. Official local autopsy reports on 12 alleged victims showed fatal levels of the poisonous gas hydrogen sulphide, one of the waste&apos;s lethal byproducts. The traders have been publicly insisting for three years that their waste was routine and harmless. They claim it was &quot;absolutely not dangerous&quot;. They have until now denied the compensation claims, and their lawyers repeatedly threatened anyone worldwide who sought to contradict their version. They launched a libel case against BBC Newsnight, forced a &quot;correction&quot; from the Times, demanded the Guardian deleted articles, and yesterday tried to gag journalists in the Netherlands and Norway with legal threats. But dozens of damning internal Trafigura emails have now come to light. They reveal how London-based company employers were told in advance that their planned chemical operation, a cheap and dirty process called &quot;caustic washing&quot;, generated such dangerous wastes it was widely outlawed. Claude Dauphin, the managing director, was told by the London manager, Naeem Ahmed, on 28 December 2005: &quot;Caustic washes are banned by most countries due to the hazardous nature of the waste (mercaptans, phenols, smell) \u2026 there are not many facilities remaining in the market. There is a company in Rotterdam that burns such waste in a high stack chimney and charges are approximately $200/kg.&quot; An email from Ahmed the previous day to the head of gasoline trading spelled out: &quot;US/Singapore and European terminals no longer allow the use of caustic soda washes since local environmental agencies do not allow disposal of the toxic caustic after treatment.&quot; Transport of such toxic waste across EU borders was outlawed, he told his bosses. It was illegal to dump it on any EU landfill. The London-based traders pressed on regardless, the documents reveal. They hoped to make profits of $7m a time by buying up what they called &quot;bloody cheap&quot; cargoes of sulphur-contaminated Mexican gasoline. They decided to try and process the fuel on board a tanker anchored offshore, creating toxic waste they called &quot;slops&quot;. One trader wrote, on 10 March 2006: &quot;I don&apos;t know how we dispose of the slops and I don&apos;t imply we would dump them, but for sure, there must be some way to pay someone to take them.&quot; The resulting black, stinking, slurry was eventually dumped around landfills in Abidjan, after Trafigura paid an unqualified local man to take it away in tanker trucks at a cheap rate. Trafigura&apos;s libel lawyers, Carter-Ruck, recently demanded the Guardian deleted published articles, saying it was &quot;gravely defamatory&quot; and &quot;untrue&quot; to say Trafigura&apos;s waste had been dumped cheaply and could have caused deaths and serious injuries. Both the Dutch paper Volkskrant and Norwegian TV said they were yesterday also threatened with gagging actions. Trafigura launched a libel action against BBC Newsnight, complaining Trafigura had been wrongly accused of causing deaths, disfigurement and miscarriages, and had &quot;suffered serious damage to their reputation&quot;. The BBC filed a fighting defence this week, accusing Trafigura of knowing its chemicals were &quot;highly toxic, potentially lethal and posed a serious risk to public health&quot;. The BBC also alleges a cover-up, saying Trafigura&apos;s denials &quot;lack credibility and candour&quot;. Newsnight plans to transmit another programme on the subject on BBC2 tonight. The UN human rights special rapporteur Professor Okechukwu Ibeanu criticised Trafigura for potentially &quot;stifling independent reporting and public criticism&quot; in a report the oil traders tried and failed to prevent being published in Geneva this week. The report said Ibeanu &quot;views with great concern reports that the company has filed or threatened to file lawsuits against various civil society and media institutions that have reported \u2026 in a critical manner&quot;. He wrote: &quot;According to official estimates, there were 15 deaths, 69 persons hospitalised and more than 108,000 medical consultations \u2026 there seems to be strong prima facie evidence that the reported deaths and adverse health consequences are related to the dumping.&quot; The report is written in cautious terms, but Trafigura&apos;s lobbyists, Bell Pottinger, responded by claiming to be &quot;appalled&quot;, saying it was &quot;premature&quot;, &quot;inaccurate&quot;, &quot;potentially damaging&quot;, &quot;poorly researched&quot;, and &quot;deeply flawed&quot;. Yesterday Greenpeace, which has been investigating the issue, along with Amnesty, launched a legal action in Amsterdam calling for the oil firm to be prosecuted there for homicide or grievous bodily harm. It said: &quot;This intentional pollution \u2026 has caused many people to suffer serious injuries and has even led to death.&quot; Trafigura said it &quot;utterly rejected&quot; claims of a cover-up. &quot;Every statement that has been made \u2026 has been made in good faith.&quot; The traders said the autopsy reports were unreliable, and that hydrogen sulphide in the waste was only there in &quot;potential&quot; form. It has never actually been released. They said the emails contained &quot;crude and distasteful&quot; language, but had been taken &quot;out of context&quot; and should &quot;not be taken literally&quot;. They repeated denials that the slops could have caused death or serious injury, and were highly toxic. They denied lying about the composition of the slops. Trafigura says it is the world&apos;s third-biggest private oil trader, and declared a $440m profit last year. Its 200 traders are reported to receive annual bonuses of up to $1m each."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/16/briatore-symonds-renault-formula-one", "sentences": ["The irony is that by suddenly quitting Renault, Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds have probably ensured the Formula One team&apos;s future \u2013 which is what they presumably intended to do by engineering the win for Fernando Alonso in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T16:29:47Z", "title": "Flavio Briatore jumps before crash crisis makes a wreck of Renault", "tags": ["Formula One", "Flavio Briatore", "Renault", "Sport", "Renault", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "The irony is that by suddenly quitting Renault, Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds have probably ensured the Formula One team&apos;s future \u2013 which is what they presumably intended to do by engineering the win for Fernando Alonso in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix. It is difficult to see any other reason for planning a course of action that would have potentially dangerous consequences, if Nelson Piquet Jr crashed to order and triggered the sequence of events that allowed Alonso to move from the back to the front of the field and score a win that ran completely against form. By having their two top executives leave the team with immediate effect, Renault appear to have admitted cheating and dealt with it internally in the hope that the FIA will choose not to apply the ultimate sanction and throw the motor manufacturer out of the world championship. But the sport&apos;s governing body may have no other course of action thanks to the rod made for their own back during the McLaren &quot;Spygate&quot; affair in 2007. McLaren were fined $100m and stripped of points in the manufacturers&apos; championship for their part in the affair involving technical information leaked from Ferrari, a minor sin when compared to race fixing which, unforgivably, threatened injury to drivers and, possibly, spectators. Some F1 insiders believe Max Mosley, in a final act of personal satisfaction before his departure as FIA president, has now added Briatore&apos;s scalp to that of McLaren&apos;s Ron Dennis. But it leaves a tricky situation for a world governing body which must be seen to take action against a dangerous ploy that has no precedent, not even within the Machiavellian world of F1. It is one thing to have subterfuge in the McLaren/Ferrari case and economies of truth in the McLaren/Lewis Hamilton &quot;Liargate&quot; scandal in Australia this year, but quite another to allow a competitor to undermine the fundamental core of a sport when even the most diehard spectators lose faith because they can&apos;t trust what they are seeing when the chequered flag falls. On the other hand, the FIA will need to consider that a ban would be responsible for the loss of 700 jobs at the team&apos;s headquarters in Oxfordshire and their F1 engine plant in Paris. Briatore was keen to avoid such a closure 12 months ago, as the Renault board prevaricated over continuing in F1 while car sales plummeted. But, whatever his reasoning, planning a crash is a move too far even if, as many believe, Piquet actually meant to tag the wall on the right as he left Turn 17 but missed it and slammed with greater speed and violence than intended into the wall on the left. By then the damage was done \u2013 in every sense. Briatore may have thought up the ploy on his own but he would have needed Symonds to plan its execution. It is the latter that has surprised and shocked most people. Symonds had an impeccable reputation as a top-class engineer with a brilliant tactical brain. We may never know precisely why he agreed to something so blatant, but now he has paid the highest price by joining Briatore as they leave F1 in disgrace."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/sep/16/philip-barnes-obituary", "sentences": ["He was in intelligence for more than three years, including in India and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T17:46:14Z", "title": "Philip Barnes obituary", "tags": ["Travel", "Travel & leisure", "Cultural trips", "Sweden holidays", "Denmark holidays", "Europe holidays", "Mexico holidays", "Peru holidays", "China holidays", "Japan holidays", "Australasia holidays", "Africa holidays", "Middle East holidays"], "article": "Philip Barnes, who has died after a long illness at the age of 83, was a pioneer in cultural tourism.

There are also shorter tours around Britain \u2013 sometimes with a specific theme, such as music, archaeology or natural history. Initially Ace managed tours and summer schools for (largely) Scandinavian teachers and students coming to Britain. In the early 1960s Philip built up contacts in the US, and Ace organised courses on European history and art for US students in Oxford, followed by a six-week study tour of Greece, France, Italy and the Netherlands. Ace subsequently responded to a growing lay interest in archaeology, again focused initially on Scandinavia, and also East Anglia. Study tours of Denmark included visits to stately and royal homes. On one occasion, a tour group was asked to be particularly punctual for a visit to the Royal Summer Palace at Sofiero, Sweden. There they were received at the door by King Gustaf VI Adolf himself, then in his 80s, who showed the visitors around personally. In the late 1960s Philip took advantage of a British enthusiasm for overseas travel that went beyond sea, sand and sun. At first, tours were to churches, castles and art galleries in western Europe. Participants travelled by coach, but in time further destinations with relatively cheap air travel became feasible. A pioneering trip to Mexico in 1974 was enormously successful, followed by Peru in 1977. In the late 1970s Philip revisited the scenes of his wartime military service, researching and then leading a\u00a0tour of Moghul India. After that, tours extended to China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand as well as north Africa and\u00a0the Middle East. An only child, Philip was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, of East Anglian stock. His father died in 1930 and in 1938 he moved with his mother to Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. In 1939 they were instructed to move to Chelmsford due to the fear of invasion after the outbreak of the second world war. Philip left school at 16, then worked as a clerk in a firm of chartered accountants. He enrolled to study economics at Birkbeck College, London, but in 1945 was called up for military service. He was in intelligence for more than three years, including in India and Singapore. After demobilisation he completed his degree and went on to Jesus College, Cambridge, to read philosophy. He visited Norway during a university vacation and found inspiration in Scandinavia \u2013 not only the postwar design, but also the wealth of ecclesiastic medieval art. On graduation he became a journalist with Reuters, based in Denmark, where he met his wife, Inger. He was a natural linguist, being at home in most western European languages. Ace was established as a non-profit company in 1958. For the first 10 years it operated on a shoestring. Philip invested his savings and had other jobs, as a supply teacher in London and then as managing director of a publishing and printing firm that produced the\u00a0Haverhill Echo and Liberal News. Philip led 229 Ace tours himself, as well as managing the company with imagination, enterprise and determination for more than 40 years, after which he handed direct management to his son Hugh. He is survived by Inger, two sons, a\u00a0daughter and five grandchildren. \u2022 Philip Brooke Barnes, cultural tour operator, born 15 June 1926; died 27 July 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/16/renault-formula-one-flavio-briatore", "sentences": ["The team said it would not contest accusations that its management encouraged Nelson Piquet Jr to crash deliberately in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix.", "&quot;The Renault team will not dispute the recent allegations made by the FIA concerning the 2008 Singapore grand prix,&quot; it said in a statement.", "Leaked documents detailing interviews with Symonds and Briatore and transcripts of the team&apos;s radio communications at the Singapore race appeared to indicate that, at the very least, there is a strong case for Renault to answer.", "The saga may have more serious consequences for Briatore and Symonds if Singapore requests their extradition to prosecute them for &quot;acts done with the intention of endangering vehicles, vessels or aircraft&quot;.", "Part One of the First Schedule of the Singapore Extradition Acts lists that as an extraditable crime, together with &quot;malicious or wilful damage to property&quot;.", "But it is believed Singapore may be reluctant to go down that road."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T20:11:59Z", "title": "Renault set to pull out of Formula One as Flavio Briatore quits", "tags": ["Formula One", "Renault", "Flavio Briatore", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "  Renault could be poised to withdraw from Formula One at the end of this season after effectively admitting its guilt in a race-fixing scam and confirming the departure of the two senior figures at the centre of the allegations, including the managing director, Flavio Briatore. The team said it would not contest accusations that its management encouraged Nelson Piquet Jr to crash deliberately in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix. Having last Friday launched legal action against its former driver, the U-turn came as a surprise even in a Formula One season that is losing its power to shock. Piquet Jr was alleged to have been ordered to crash on a specific lap in order to help his team leader, Fernando Alonso, win, thanks to the appearance of the safety car. Senior executives at Renault Group had said they would not rush to any hasty conclusions about the team&apos;s future, but their presence in next year&apos;s championship has already been called into question by the departure of its main sponsor, ING, and the likely departure of its main driver, Alonso, for Ferrari. Briatore, the Renault team&apos;s managing director and a colourful figure in the sport for more than two decades, and Pat Symonds, the executive director of engineering, left their posts with immediate effect ahead of Monday&apos;s meeting of the FIA&apos;s world motor sport council. &quot;The Renault team will not dispute the recent allegations made by the FIA concerning the 2008 Singapore grand prix,&quot; it said in a statement.\u00a0 &quot;It also wishes to state that its managing director, Flavio Briatore, and its executive director of engineering Pat Symonds have left the team.&quot; Monday&apos;s extraordinary meeting will proceed in Paris as planned to decide what penalty should be imposed on the French car maker for its part in the latest of a seemingly endless string of scandals which have embroiled the sport for the past decade or more. Leaked documents detailing interviews with Symonds and Briatore and transcripts of the team&apos;s radio communications at the Singapore race appeared to indicate that, at the very least, there is a strong case for Renault to answer. The FIA offered Piquet Jr immunity in return for outlining his allegations. Symonds is also believed to have been offered immunity, but it now appears unlikely he will take up the offer. The Formula One commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, said he could not comment on the likely decision of the council, on which he sits alongside the FIA president, Max Mosley, and 24 others, but said he &quot;felt sorry&quot; for his close friend Briatore. The saga may have more serious consequences for Briatore and Symonds if Singapore requests their extradition to prosecute them for &quot;acts done with the intention of endangering vehicles, vessels or aircraft&quot;. Part One of the First Schedule of the Singapore Extradition Acts lists that as an extraditable crime, together with &quot;malicious or wilful damage to property&quot;. But it is believed Singapore may be reluctant to go down that road. Whether Briatore jumped or was pushed is neither here nor there in the ultimate analysis; Renault concluded that both had to go if the team was to have a hope of drawing the sting from any FIA penalty \u2013 which could include their exclusion from the title race a few days before the first anniversary of the controversial event. This has been a fast-moving saga, fuelled by the embittered Piquet who was dropped from the team last month, through to the symbolic sacrifice of Renault&apos;s leading player, Briatore. The sequence of events mirrors the way in which the McLaren chairman, Ron Dennis, and his lieutenant, Dave Ryan, were sidelined following the so-called &quot;Liargate&quot; controversy involving Lewis Hamilton at this year&apos;s race in Melbourne. Both Ryan and Symonds were caught in the crossfire and were not the main targets of the FIA&apos;s ire. Formula One is split on Renault&apos;s likely intentions. Some argue that the decision to part company with Briatore and Symonds suggests the team were preparing a case to appeal for clemency by the FIA and enable it to honour an earlier commitment to compete until at least 2012. Others are convinced the scandal will merely have hardened Renault&apos;s intention to pull out, but that Briatore and Symonds had to go to limit the damage to the team&apos;s reputation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/16/trafigura-oil-pollution-fortune-tragedy", "sentences": ["He told colleagues: &quot;We should be talking to specialist chemical clean-up companies.&quot; He wrote: &quot;Claude owns a waste disposal company and wants us to be creative.&quot; His colleague Naeem Ahmed warned: &quot;US/Singapore and European terminals no longer allow the use of caustic soda washes since local environmental agencies do not allow disposal of the toxic caustic after treatment.&quot; He reported to Dauphin: &quot;Caustic washes are banned by most countries due to the hazardous nature of the waste (mercaptans, phenols, smell) \u2026 There are not many facilities remaining in the market."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-16T22:25:07Z", "title": "Trafigura hoped to make a fortune.

Thousands of tonnes of &quot;coker gasoline&quot; was being sold off from a Mexican state refinery at Cadereyta. Trafigura trader James McNicol wrote from the firm&apos;s Oxford Street office block: &quot;This is as cheap as anyone can imagine and should make serious dollars \u2026 Each cargo should make 7m!!&quot; To clean up the dirty fuel, which they described as &quot;crap&quot; or &quot;shit&quot;, the traders planned to add caustic soda to absorb sulphur contaminants, despite being told this process was banned in the west. The &quot;most difficult&quot; problem, as they recorded, was how to dispose of the resultant stinking toxic waste. In December 2005, McNicol promised the company head, Claude Dauphin: &quot;We will make it happen&quot;. He told colleagues: &quot;We should be talking to specialist chemical clean-up companies.&quot; He wrote: &quot;Claude owns a waste disposal company and wants us to be creative.&quot; His colleague Naeem Ahmed warned: &quot;US/Singapore and European terminals no longer allow the use of caustic soda washes since local environmental agencies do not allow disposal of the toxic caustic after treatment.&quot; He reported to Dauphin: &quot;Caustic washes are banned by most countries due to the hazardous nature of the waste (mercaptans, phenols, smell) \u2026 There are not many facilities remaining in the market. There is a company in Rotterdam that burns such waste in a high stack chimney and charges are approximately $200/kg.&quot; That was considered too expensive. A Tunisian tank terminal was finally persuaded to handle caustic processing, but the owners ejected Trafigura because the stench caused protests from workers. Trafigura&apos;s London head of gasoline trading, Leon Christophilopoulos, suggested a desperate remedy: a floating refinery: &quot;I don&apos;t know how we dispose of the slops and I don&apos;t imply we would dump them, but for sure, there must be some way to pay someone to take them.&quot; A chartered tanker, the Probo Koala, was anchored off Gibraltar. Between April and June, it took three cargoes, each of 28,000 tonnes of contaminated gasoline, and mixed them with caustic soda and a catalyst. About 47% of the sulphur was removed, said statements filed at the high court by the BBC. The Probo Koala&apos;s spare tanks soon filled up with waste containing freshly created sulphur compounds. Company emails show a highly concentrated 33% caustic solution had been used on board. This may have produced an even higher proportion of toxic compounds than in conventional refinery waste. By 18 April, Christophilopoulos was fretting: &quot;We \u2026 still haven&apos;t tackled how we will dispose of the washings on board the vessel.&quot; In June, the tanker headed for Amsterdam. Ahmed booked a disposal firm, claiming the waste was simply routine &quot;slops&quot; from rinsing out petrol tanks. The plan failed. After uproar over the stench Trafigura reloaded the waste and sailed to Africa. Ahmed and Trafigura currently face prosecution in the Netherlands where they deny telling lies. The tanker finally sailed to Ivory Coast, for the waste to be dumped by a local contractor, Salomon Ugborugbo. Ugborugbo had no experience, or facilities. He had somehow obtained a port licence shortly before. For a very low price his hired tanker-trucks took away the black slurry. What followed was an environmental and human catastrophe. The waste ended up being tipped all around Abidjan. It would have contained such unstable substances as mercaptans, mercaptides, sodium sulphide and dialkyl disulphides. Those living and working nearby risked burns, nausea, diarrhoea, loss of consciousness and death from contact with such compounds. The most sombre allegations concern the killer gas hydrogen sulphide. Sulphur compounds can break down in the environment and release it. The thousands of reports of casualties followed a pattern which appears consistent with an escape of hydrogen sulphide. Inhabitants near the dump sites reported respiratory and eye problems, while further away, people reported nauseating smells. However, Trafigura went on to issue a series of public statements which said the victims&apos; claims to have been poisoned by Trafigura were imaginary. Trafigura yesterday said that &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that the slops would generate hydrogen sulphide at levels that could have caused the deaths and serious injuries alleged&quot;. As 31,000 Africans, many desperately poor, joined in an unprecedented group action for compensation organised by London lawyer Martyn Day, Trafigura tried repeatedly to give the impression that its ship had only pumped out ordinary slops from tank-cleaning: a completely different type of activity. It claimed such discharges from ships were &quot;a routine procedure that is undertaken all over the world&quot;. It said that &quot;to label Trafigura&apos;s slops as &quot;toxic waste&quot; in no way accurately reflects their true composition&quot; and that &quot;Trafigura is in no way responsible&quot; for any sickness in Abidjan. The Baron Eric de Turckheim, another founding director, told BBC Newsnight that his firm&apos;s waste was &quot;absolutely not dangerous to human beings&quot;. Trafigura maintained this position as long as it could, muzzling the media with aggressive statements from the expensive lobbying firm Bell Pottinger and the equally expensive libel lawyers Carter-Ruck. It was only yesterday afternoon, facing likely publication of their internal emails, that the firm announced it was suing for peace with the 31,000 Ivorians who have been trying to get compensation.

Mills now intends to sign up four commercial partners to a five-year sponsorship programme with Team Origin, and each must contractually commit to a stringent package of carbon-emissions constraints designed by the Carbon Trust. Mills will approach up to 40 of the FTSE 100 companies before Christmas and, having put together the London 2012 bid&apos;s commercial programme, is confident he can persuade four principal sponsors to sign up to the programme, each contributing between \u00a33m and \u00a34m a year. &quot;The traditional model of sports sponsorship in the current economic climate is a much more difficult sell,&quot; said Mills. &quot;We are using the team and the sport to demonstrate how a company&apos;s reduction in carbon emissions is good business.&quot; As a first step Mills, the multiple Olympic champion and Team Origin skipper, Ben Ainslie, and all his crew have personally signed up to the 10:10 campaign launched by the Guardian this month.

Alonso&apos;s race strategy had been compromised by a technical problem during qualifying which had him start from 15th. The plan had been to make three pit stops as opposed to the favoured two, the subsequent light load of fuel at the start giving Alonso the momentum to pass three cars on the first lap. But, even allowing for the short first stint, Alonso was called in on lap 12, two laps earlier than planned, because he was snared behind a slower car. According to radio transcripts, Alonso did not question this instruction which went against what should have been the agreed plan. Alonso was alone in the field of 20 cars to make his stop; Piquet crashed two laps later, triggering the sequence of events that eventually allowed Alonso to move into the lead as everyone else refuelled while the safety car was in operation. But Alonso should not have known that was going to happen when ordered to stop on lap 12. Ross Brawn, during his time at Ferrari, commented that Michael Schumacher would never question any command from the pit wall, no matter how strange it might seem. &quot;Michael would focus on the driving and leave the team to take care of everything else,&quot; Brawn said. &quot;If we told him to stop, he would. If we said: &apos;Michael, if we are to win this race, you need to find a second a lap for the next 16 laps&apos;, he would do that.&quot; Alonso would have acted exactly the same way. Nonetheless sceptics point out that Alonso was not averse to threatening to blackmail McLaren with details of the &quot;Spygate&quot; scandal if they did not either keep Lewis Hamilton in check or actually go as far as engineering a problem with Hamilton&apos;s car in the 2007 Hungarian grand prix. It would be a short step to fixing a race by having a team-mate, desperate to hang on to his place in the team, crash deliberately. Ferrari usually announce their drivers for the following season at Monza.

Other bidders are judged to be not far behind. The US bidder has natural advantages in terms of the revenue it would attract in sponsorship and TV rights but has also been hit by a drop in public support and wrangling over the level of local government financial guarantees. Rogge said that was all settled, adding that recent disputes between the US Olympic Association and the IOC over the launch of a new TV network would &quot;have no negative effect whatsoever&quot;. But he did say that public support was &quot;an important factor&quot;. Rogge predicted the vote, to be taken on October 2 after a final round of presentations to the 106 IOC members, would be one of the closest ever. &quot;I had a feeling in Singapore that the race was very close. I thought it would be decided by around half a dozen votes, in the end it was not six votes, it was four votes,&quot; he said. &quot;I think I can make a bet today and say it will be a couple of votes. I think it&apos;s going to be very close.

Similar restrictions apply at the Football Association, where directors must step down at the AGM following their 70th birthday. In the Premier League the rules are more restrictive, requiring chairmen to quit on that date. Mawhinney admits he has yet to make any decision as to the exact timing of his departure but has not ruled out leaving at the end of this season. &quot;I have no intention other than not to transgress the laws of the League, which I have spent so long upholding,&quot; Mawhinney said. &quot;I\u00a0have sought guidance and the rules say people should not be on the board beyond 70, and in custom and practice that&apos;s interpreted as being that you shouldn&apos;t serve beyond the term of the session in progress when you attain that age. I have to leave the board by July 2011.&quot; Mawhinney has already spent almost eight years as the League&apos;s executive chairman, a broad role that ensures he will be difficult to replace. Indeed there may be some constitutional upheaval if the League decides to split the role into two, with a separate chief executive and chairman. There is bound to be a period of politicking from potential candidates such as Ipswich Town&apos;s long-serving FA board member, David Sheepshanks, or the All England Club chief executive and Wembley director, Ian Ritchie.

England tie-up for players England players&apos; contractual obligations with the Football Association&apos;s sponsors have finally been agreed after eight years. The FA&apos;s commercial director, Jonathan Hill, before announcing his departure this month, thrashed out the terms of the agreement with Terry Burn, the chairman of 1966, the firm representing the players&apos; interests. The two parties had been operating under a brief heads-of-terms agreement which lacked the watertight obligations of a contract. Sources say one will soon be in place after both sides&apos; lawyers finalise the details. This will be a relief to the FA as it seeks to replace partners such as the FA Cup sponsor, E.On. Matters came to a head in 2006 when the agents of Wayne Rooney, right, gave notice he would withdraw his co-operation from FA marketing activities after the governing body suspended him for three Premier League games after he was sent off in a pre\u2011season friendly. Under the terms of the new agreement there would be recourse against players refusing to co\u2011operate with sponsors&apos; activities.

Fortunately with the club having wealthy fans such as the millionaire philanthropist Sir Maurice Hatter and the club chairman, Richard Murray, that has been possible.

Remarkably, Piquet Jnr has a contract in place that would see him give up 20% of his earnings to Briatore over the next 15 years.

That is despite Briatore&apos;s assertion last Friday in Monza that no wrongdoing took place, and that he had the support of the team. Briatore also commenced criminal proceedings that day against the Piquets concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail.

It was an exhilarating ride, but the results have disappointed. From the shambles of most African democracies to the autocracies of the Middle East and the authoritarian states of Russia and China, we see democracy deformed and demeaned. The western societies which hold themselves up as models are in better shape, but also face insidious threats to the vitality of their political life. It is a sign of these worrying times that Humphrey Hawkesley and John Kampfner, using the insights and experiences gained from much travel and reporting abroad, should have simultaneously set themselves the task of charting what has gone wrong. These two good journalists adopt similar methods and come to a similar conclusion, which is that an alliance between politicians and the better-off is, in almost every country, undermining democracy by limiting rights and excluding the poor. Hawkesley has long been the Candide of foreign correspondents, beginning as an optimist but, as he has gone round the world posing his deceptively simple questions, progressively exposing how pessimistic the honest observer is forced to become. For more than 20 years he has been embarrassing, irritating and sometimes infuriating politicians, officials and businessmen. A typical Hawkesley operation will find him in some remote village talking to a crippled child, a destitute labourer or a desperate ex-soldier about the failure of the powers-that-be to notice their plight. He will then single-mindedly trace the chain of responsibility back through local bureaucrats, national politicians and western businessmen and aid givers, meeting evasion at every turn. Finally, in some smart hotel where men in silk suits and women in splendid dresses are discussing development, he will cause a commotion by pointing out that what they are doing is not helping the poor. Some of the conversations he reports are surreal. Following up gross violations of labour laws at a quarry in the Indian state of Haryana, he discovers that the state employment commissioner, responsible for 17,000 square miles and 20 million people, does not have a car. How, then, does he inspect sites? &quot;We are going by bus,&quot; replies the commissioner. &quot;But buses don&apos;t go to the quarry,&quot; says Hawkesley. &quot;That is the point,&quot; says the commissioner, apparently pleased to bring the conversation round to what for him is a logical conclusion.  The heart of the book is a score or so of such encounters, by turns comical and tragic, which he pulls together to illustrate his theme that democracy makes things worse rather than better in many societies. Indeed, this kind of democracy can kill, as his title suggests, encouraging conflict rather than resolving it. It is an engaging record of a dogged and decent journalist at work. If there is a criticism to be made it is that the thesis is very general, and does not sufficiently distinguish between different kinds of democracy. Kampfner&apos;s approach focuses on an unholy pact which he believes unites a number of otherwise dissimilar societies. Whether they are authoritarian states such as China or established democracies such as Italy or Britain, the trade-off is the same: the political class offers the better-off a degree of security, comfort and personal choice in return for the suspension, abrogation or abandonment of freedoms and human rights in the broader society.  The result is a &quot;narrowing of the gap between democracies and autocracies&quot;. It also, of course, involves the abandonment of the ideals of solidarity and socialism. Kampfner begins with Singapore, where he was born, and the state which could be said to have pioneered the semi-benign authoritarianism, with democratic trappings, which prefigured the pact. Correspondents in the region used to call it &quot;fascism with a human face&quot;, by joking analogy with Alexander Dubcek&apos;s shortlived socialism with a human face in Czechoslovakia.  Kampfner is particularly good on Russia, a country he knows well, but less convincing on Britain and America. He has quite a lot to say about government surveillance of the public, but not much to say about public surveillance of those who govern. This is the &quot;monitoring&quot; democracy, in which elected leaders are pursued and sometimes persecuted by an endlessly complaining and aggrieved public. The pact works better as an explanation of some societies than it does of others, but it is undoubtedly an illuminating concept, although far from new. John Kenneth Galbraith laid out a version of it in The Affluent Society. Mrs Thatcher&apos;s Britain, after all, was described as an &quot;alliance of the comfortable&quot;. And there is a long history of academic work both on semi-authoritarian societies and illiberal democracies, with the American writers Marina Ottaway and Fareed Zakaria among those who have contributed.  The difficult question is whether the tendencies for democracies to regress, and for liberalising autocracies to stop movement toward democracy at the halfway house represented by the pact, is getting worse or becoming irretrievable. Much of the historical evidence suggests that these dangers and temptations are democracy&apos;s permanent companions, sometimes embraced and sometimes kept at a distance.  Ultimately, there is also the question of how much weight democracy can be asked to bear. Eighty years ago, in the aftermath of the first world war, at a time of an earlier democratic wave, the American journalist and political thinker Walter Lippmann wrestled with the fact that democracies face two huge difficulties: the vices of their politicians and the defects of their citizens. He reluctantly concluded that the informed, rational citizens which democratic theory postulates do not exist, at least not in sufficient numbers, while the virtuous leaders the system requires are also in short supply. Democracy&apos;s imperfections, in other words, can only be limited, never fully remedied. \u2022 To order Democracy Kills for \u00a311.99 and Freedom For Sale for \u00a317.99, both with free UK p&amp;p, call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to theguardian.com/bookshop."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/20/nelson-piquet-flavio-briatore-singapore", "sentences": ["Nelson Piquet Jr may have been granted immunity in the Singapore Crashgate case, which opens before the World Motor Sport Council hearing in Paris tomorrow, but the young Brazilian has a lot to answer for.", "Apart from blowing the whistle for full time on the lengthy Formula One careers of Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds, Piquet&apos;s crude use of the throttle pedal in Singapore last year propelled the sport as well as his Renault into the proverbial gutter.", "It was an act as premeditated as Renault&apos;s appears to have been in Singapore, but one where the consequences could have been far more severe.", "A similar argument applies to Singapore although, in this case, the accident occurred at 100mph slower.", "And F1, having lost Honda and, for the moment, BMW, can ill afford to usher the departure of a team that, until Singapore 2008, had brought a great deal to the sport.", "As newspapers across the world delivered their verdicts on Thursday, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times hastily pointed out that the scandal would not affect their race next weekend.", "And neither will it affect this extraordinary championship, still headed by Jenson Button, as it races on to the final leg through Singapore, Japan, Brazil and Abu Dhabi."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-19T23:10:01Z", "title": "Renault's folly was potentially lethal but Ayrton Senna was worse | Maurice Hamilton", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009", "Ayrton Senna"], "article": "Nelson Piquet Jr may have been granted immunity in the Singapore Crashgate case, which opens before the World Motor Sport Council hearing in Paris tomorrow, but the young Brazilian has a lot to answer for. Apart from blowing the whistle for full time on the lengthy Formula One careers of Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds, Piquet&apos;s crude use of the throttle pedal in Singapore last year propelled the sport as well as his Renault into the proverbial gutter. That does not lessen the serious charge against Briatore and Symonds, that they conspired with the Brazilian to crash deliberately, but, by making a hash of what should have been a simple tap against the wall, Piquet appears to have missed the planned point of contact on the right of the corner and spun with far greater force into the concrete on the left side of the track. The subsequent eruption of suspension parts and fibreglass not only showed the folly of planning such a risky manoeuvre in the first place but it also, according to one writer last seen at a race more than a decade ago, indicted F1 with playing out the worst act of cheating ever seen in sport. Such an emotional statement is prefaced on the lethal possibilities associated with a poorly executed manoeuvre by an average F1 driver. But it is no different to Ayrton Senna driving into the back of Alain Prost as the field swept into the first corner of the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix. The rear wing of Prost&apos;s Ferrari was flung into the air as 24 cars bore down at 175mph. The McLaren and the Ferrari finished in the gravel trap at the end of a deliberate act that gave Senna the championship on the spot. It was an act as premeditated as Renault&apos;s appears to have been in Singapore, but one where the consequences could have been far more severe. There are other examples: Senna trying to squeeze Prost against the pit wall at 180mph in Portugal and Michael Schumacher pushing Fernando Alonso on to the grass at a similar speed during the 2003 British Grand Prix. No one was hurt in either instance, but they could have been during incidents involving open-wheel racing cars. A similar argument applies to Singapore although, in this case, the accident occurred at 100mph slower. The point is, however, that in each case the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile did not so much as hold an investigation, never mind hand out a punishment. That is but one of many dilemmas facing the WMSC. If the FIA are to be consistent in their apparent disregard for potentially dangerous actions, the emphasis tomorrow should be on Renault appearing to fix the outcome of the race in a blatant move that smacks of the arrogance associated with F1 and participants who have been made wealthy beyond their dreams. The level of punishment has been determined by the $100m fine levied on McLaren in 2007 for purloining Ferrari paperwork. That now seems even more outrageous in the light of Renault&apos;s infinitely more serious misdemeanour. The FIA will doubtless sidestep the question by saying that McLaren were hit hard for lying during the first WMSC hearing. Renault, by dismissing Briatore and Symonds and saying they will not contest the charges, have come clean and given reasonable grounds to avoid being kicked out of the sport. Neither F1 nor Renault can afford such a penalty. If banned from F1, Renault might stay away for good since their future is already shaky thanks to languishing in eighth place in the constructors&apos; championship, having no title sponsor for next year and, possibly, no decent driver if Alonso moves to Ferrari. And F1, having lost Honda and, for the moment, BMW, can ill afford to usher the departure of a team that, until Singapore 2008, had brought a great deal to the sport. As newspapers across the world delivered their verdicts on Thursday, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times hastily pointed out that the scandal would not affect their race next weekend. And neither will it affect this extraordinary championship, still headed by Jenson Button, as it races on to the final leg through Singapore, Japan, Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But even in a world where rule-bending is as common as it is in other sports, F1 will be conscious of the craven image created by Renault&apos;s outrageous and blatant manipulation of last year&apos;s race. The final irony is that Renault were lucky \u2013 if that&apos;s the right word \u2013 because had Felipe Massa and Ferrari not screwed up their refuelling stop, Alonso would never have made it to the top step of the podium. It could be argued that by initiating the safety car and the rash of pit stops that followed, Renault pressured Massa into leaving the pits prematurely and dragging the fuel hose with him. That cost him the race and, arguably, the championship. Massa, making a steady recovery in Brazil from head injuries sustained in Hungary, must have mixed emotions over his countryman exposing totally unacceptable antics that changed the course of history but hardly constituted the worst act of cheating in the sporting\u00a0universe."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/20/renault-singapore-briatore-piquet-cheating", "sentences": ["In Singapore you can pick up a criminal record for chewing gum or not flushing a toilet properly, so one would expect the constabulary to frown on race-fixing and grand prix pilots being ordered to drive into walls.", "This may yet be the fate of the Renault conspirators, whose stunt in the Singapore Grand Prix determined not only the outcome of that pantomime but arguably the 2008 drivers&apos; championship as well.", "When Renault&apos;s Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds convened to fix the Singapore race via a crash which gave them control of the pit-stop strategies of an entire F1 field, we saw men playing anti-gods, choreographers of gain, in the style of Hansie Cronje.", "Somehow, a faithless crowd are able to keep pushing through the turnstiles even when they discover that the race they enjoyed from Singapore was just a filthy lie.", "As if to prove F1&apos;s immunity to shame, to self-reflection, a press release dropped the day after Briatore&apos;s resignation announcing a new partnership between Brawn GP and Canon for round 14 of this year&apos;s championship in, you guessed it, Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-19T23:10:02Z", "title": "Forget purity, sport has never been innocent | Paul Hayward", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "In Singapore you can pick up a criminal record for chewing gum or not flushing a toilet properly, so one would expect the constabulary to frown on race-fixing and grand prix pilots being ordered to drive into walls.

Taken to its extreme, my solution would lead to bobbies running on the pitch to arrest members of the Tom Daley school of Premier League diving. Simulation wins games and makes money. But you don&apos;t need a barrister&apos;s wig to see that pre-planned roguery away from the field of play belongs in a separate category to spontaneous chiselling that falls under the jurisdiction of the referee. Ben Johnson&apos;s steroid abuse was planned. Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s lunatic crash was planned. Systematic doping in the Tour de France was planned (which is why French police got their handcuffs out). The Harlequins fake blood farrago was planned. State\u2011sponsored doping programmes in East Germany and beyond were planned. Their goal was international prestige, and they ruined and even ended lives, which is why the Piquet prang falls short of the &quot;worst act of cheating in the history of sport&quot;. What a good title, though. How it cries out to be bestowed. A life in sport is a journey away from innocence. It kills the youthful assumption that games are a refuge from injustice. However craven the world, the rule of law would prevail. Fairness, so elusive in society, was the real prize in the great triviality. It was not just British Corinthianism that propagated this myth. Americans are still hooked on an ideal of purity. The most infamous act of cheating in the whole American canon \u2013 the throwing of the 1919 World Series by the Chicago White Sox, as part of a betting scam \u2013 was reframed as a redemptive tale. &quot;Say it ain&apos;t so, Joe,&quot; is the eternal reassertion of virtue over venality. Skulduggery is not distinguishable from sport. It is built into the organism, and always was, from the first Olympiads, when cheating was an art form. When Renault&apos;s Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds convened to fix the Singapore race via a crash which gave them control of the pit-stop strategies of an entire F1 field, we saw men playing anti-gods, choreographers of gain, in the style of Hansie Cronje. But here&apos;s a question: how many modern sports have expired because spectators stomped away out of sheer moral disgust? Answer: none. Every road cycling fan I have ever spoken to compartmentalises that which appals him when a drugs bust takes place away from the spectacle that lights up summer evenings when the Tour de France is whizzing across our screens. Chemical assaults on the body in track and field and cycling are more dangerous to more people than Piquet&apos;s smash. They build self-harm into the system; they render top-level success impossible without massive pharmaceutical risk. Here, too, we see a kind of parallel engagement in the audience. People say they are &quot;not surprised&quot; by this or that scandal. Matt Le Tissier confesses, in his autobiography, to trying to land a spread betting coup by kicking the ball out early in a game, and football&apos;s masses smile and say: &quot;Bet that happens all the time.&quot; My theory is that the modern disengagement from remote, superstar athletes makes us not care about them, as humans, and often not trust them, either. They are &quot;entertainers&quot; on an ever-rolling screen of digestible &quot;moments&quot;. Deep down there is still a craving for sport to be character-revealing, life-enhancing, noble. Somehow, a faithless crowd are able to keep pushing through the turnstiles even when they discover that the race they enjoyed from Singapore was just a filthy lie. As if to prove F1&apos;s immunity to shame, to self-reflection, a press release dropped the day after Briatore&apos;s resignation announcing a new partnership between Brawn GP and Canon for round 14 of this year&apos;s championship in, you guessed it, Singapore. Every day is a rewrite, every violation of the so-called spirit of sport a jumping-off point for someone to say it&apos;s &quot;time to move on&quot; and &quot;draw a line&quot;, thus exploiting the boredom factor of a super-fast news agenda. It is frightening, really. But then, if people will surrender to public service cuts that stem from a culture of bailing out banks \u2013 and allowing big bonuses to creep back up \u2013 they are hardly likely to take to the streets in protest at the protagonists nicking a living from sport. The race-fixer&apos;s best friend is our acquiescence. Ashes glory still shines in the darkness Six-nil will probably end up as seven today when England try to avoid becoming completely banjoed in the one-day series. Andrew Strauss looks mortified, his team are imploding and Australia claim to have reconquered the psychological ground they lost in the Ashes. But have they? It&apos;s universally popular to say England have tossed away their Ashes victory by capitulating in the 50-over game. And it does make you question the value of sobriety. This time England eschewed the all-night bender in favour of modesty and self-denial. A fat lot of good it did them. Even without the hangover, Strauss&apos;s men walked to the slaughter. Then again, to deposit summer&apos;s memory on a dump and submit to Australia&apos;s need to feel they are back on top is needlessly self-lacerating. The Ashes triumph still exists. So does the recollection of Strauss&apos;s brilliant leadership at The Oval. England have been lousy at 50-over cricket for as long as anyone can remember. They appear incapable of taking it seriously. The format may disappear before they have a chance to master it. Ridicule is appropriate, given their lamentable displays in this NatWest pain marathon, but the greater glory of a second Ashes win in three series still stands. The Test team lost 5-0 in Australia the time before last, so a zero is no automatic ticket to oblivion. Five reasons to savour today&apos;s Manchester derby 1 We all know history dawned with the invention of the Premier League, but back in the 1980s, post-industrial Manchester was searching for a future. Milan may be the global HQ for the club game \u2013 with AC and Inter still imperious \u2013 but United&apos;s record of 11 Premier League titles and City&apos;s \u00a3200m splurge on players could yet knock Italy&apos;s fashionistas off their plinth. 2 Creativity. Both sides attack and entertain. Neither club is remotely arriviste. Each has a strong spiritual identity and believes in cultivating youth. 3 City&apos;s management core is ex-United. Mark Hughes, the manager, and Brian Kidd, the new head of technical development, were mainstays of Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s first trophy-winning phase. Throw in Carlos Tevez and you have a proper talent raid, proper edge. 4 Ferguson loves a demon. First it was Liverpool, then Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, then Roman Abramovich&apos;s Chelsea. Now he turns his fire on &quot;a small club with a small mentality&quot; who are &quot;cocky&quot; and have had a &quot;softish start&quot;. This new incitement could delay retirement for a few more years. 5 Emmanuel Adebayor has been the axis of City&apos;s forward play. Today we learn whether they can prosper without him. Cause of the week Sir Bobby Robson&apos;s memorial service at Durham Cathedral tomorrow will bring the greats together to say goodbye not just to a great football man but an age in the English game. A melodramatic temptation is to say that the values he embodied have been under attack for so long that his passing marks the death of something deeper. But Robson would have scoffed at that. For him football was inviolable. It could not be hijacked by mercenary players or hooligan chairmen. His love for the game survived many attacks and setbacks. Never let go: that was his cause."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/20/renault-formula-one-fia-singapore-crash", "sentences": ["The French team have stated that they will not contest allegations that they conspired with their former driver Nelson Piquet Jnr to cause an accident \u00ad deliberately during last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-20T14:11:44Z", "title": "Renault's Formula One future in balance as FIA meets over Crashgate", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Renault&apos;s future in Formula One will hang in the balance when they appear before the FIA world motor sport council in Paris tomorrow morning, to find out what sanction will be taken over the Crashgate scandal. The French team have stated that they will not contest allegations that they conspired with their former driver Nelson Piquet Jnr to cause an accident \u00ad deliberately during last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix. But they will be hoping for a lenient verdict after Flavio Briatore, their managing director, and their executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds, left the team last week. With the two principal architects of the scandal now beyond FIA jurisdiction, and Piquet having been granted immunity from prosecution, the court hearing had been expected to be brief and to the point. However, there were reports over the weekend that the driver Fernando Alonso had been summoned to appear. Alonso has repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge about the origins of the crash, but Piquet&apos;s father, the triple world champion Nelson Piquet, insists the Spaniard must have known. There are suggestions that Alonso could be closely questioned over Briatore&apos;s role. \u2022 Piquet Jnr and Alonso arrive for Paris hearing\u2022 Maurice Hamilton: Senna&apos;s crash was worse\u2022 Paul Hayward: Sport has never been innocent\u2022 Richard Williams on Flavio Briatore&apos;s downfall The motor sport council \u2013 which has 26 members, including the FIA president, Max Mosley, and the Formula One commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, \u2013 is expected to retire to consider what penalties should be imposed, if any, on the French car maker. The formal verdict may well not be made public until tomorrow morning, in line with established FIA\u00a0custom. However, the question of Piquet being granted immunity has enraged Carlos Gracia, the head of the Spanish automobile federation, who criticised both driver and governing body in spectacular terms over the weekend. &quot;The kid [Piquet], if it was up to me, wouldn&apos;t be allowed to walk blind people on the sidewalk,&quot; he was quoted as telling the Spanish radio station Onda Cero. &quot;It&apos;s such yobbish behaviour from which he has also benefited because, like he said in his sworn statement, he did it so that he would get a contract renewal for 2009 and he will be paid until the end of the year. &quot;In that case this is a person who should not only be sanctioned by the council and the FIA, but should also be prosecuted in an ordinary court. I found out through the press that Mr Nelsinho was going to get immunity. It would be totally shameless if this happened in the FIA.&quot; Gracia also criticised the influence which Piquet&apos;s father has had over his son, effectively accusing Piquet Sr of spoiling Piquet Jr. &quot;He is a silly kid who doesn&apos;t know if he has pushed the throttle or not because [it&apos;s] no coincidence that he has had 17 accidents since he has been at Renault,&quot; he said. &quot;The father has an uncontrollable kid and he is a resentful parent. When they turn the fan on, they try to get the shit to hit as many people as possible.&quot; Gracia said it was right Briatore and Symonds had left the team. &quot;Renault is a very serious company,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a company that has been in the world of motor sport for many years without any kind of immorality.&quot; The Renault team, who could face a ban\u00a0or an unlimited fine from the FIA, will be hoping that the governing body will feel similarly generous-minded in its deliberations tomorrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/21/today-in-sport-21-september", "sentences": ["9.52am: Fernando Alonso and the Nelson Piquets have arrived in Paris for the FIA&apos;s hearing into race-fixing at the Singapore grand prix last year.", "\u2022 The FIA hearing into race-fixing at last year&apos;s Singapore GP, at the World Motor Sports Council in Paris.", "British Cycling&apos;s Performance Director Dave Brailsford said in a statement: &quot;All our focus and attention right now is on Johnny and his family and ensuring that they are looked after and given the best possible care at this time.&quot;  JD  1.10pm: Renault have been given a two-year suspended ban for Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s deliberate crash at the Singapore GP, while Flavio Briatore has been banned from motor sport for life for his actions in Crashgate.", "The FIA said:   &quot;At an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council held in Paris on 21 September 2009, the Renault F1 team admitted that the team had conspired with its driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to cause a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, in breach of the International Sporting Code and F1 Sporting Regulations.&quot;  You can read the FIA&apos;s verdict in full here.", "By the time of the Singapore GP he had isolated me and driven me to the lowest point I had ever reached in my life."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-21T08:09:13Z", "title": "Today in Sport - as it happened", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": " 9.06am: Good morning and welcome to our new(ish) rolling sports blog. For those of you who are not familiar with the concept, the idea is this: throughout the day we will update this page with news, links, and what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead. Time permitting, we&apos;ll also try to wade in below the line, answering your questions and comments.  9.52am: Fernando Alonso and the Nelson Piquets have arrived in Paris for the FIA&apos;s hearing into race-fixing at the Singapore grand prix last year. Owen Gibson is in Paris and will be providing updates on what&apos;s happening throughout the day. It&apos;s possible that the FIA will reach its verdict today, and although Renault are prepared for a fine, the FIA is unlikely to expel them from Formula One. PW  10.10am: Following our news meeting, here&apos;s a taste of what&apos;s on the agenda: \u2022 Fall-out from the &apos;Mad-chester&apos; derby: the item thrown by a United fan, presumably at Carlos Tevez, which instead struck Javier Garrido; and a potential police inquiry into Craig Bellamy&apos;s altercation with an encroaching fan. \u2022 Possible action in the wake of El Hadji Diouf allegedly racially abusing a ball boy during Blackburn&apos;s 3-0 defeat at Everton. \u2022 An injury update on Didier Drogba, who was carried off for Chelsea against Spurs, plus news on Sebastien Bassong and Ledley King, who both suffered injury at Stamford Bridge, leaving Tottenham with four key centre backs now on the treatment table. \u2022 The FIA hearing into race-fixing at last year&apos;s Singapore GP, at the World Motor Sports Council in Paris. According to our man at the hearing, Owen Gibson:  The WMSC could make an announcement on their verdict as early as this afternoon. It is likely Renault will be fined and possibly suspended from competing. A full expulsion from Formula One is, though, thought to be unlikely.  \u2022 Bobby Robson&apos;s thanksgiving service takes place today. We&apos;ll have audio from Paul Hayward at the service and a gallery. \u2022 And blog-wise: Sid Lowe on La Liga; Paolo Bandini&apos;s Serie A column; Raphael Honigstein on the Bundesliga; Rob Smyth&apos;s weekend Premier League breakdown; plus Paul Rees reflecting on the weekend&apos;s rugby union action. JD             10.25am: As much as the Manchester derby is covered elsewhere here on the site, one question does spring to mind: should Craig Bellamy have got involved with the encroaching fan at Old Trafford yesterday? Do you agree with Mark Hughes&apos;s viewpoint?  &quot;I seem to recall Brian Clough clipping someone around the ear once [after Nottingham Forest&apos;s fans had invaded the pitch] and he was lauded as a national hero. Maybe it will be the same with Craig but I doubt it. I&apos;m sure people will make a nuisance of it.&quot;  JD  10.45am: And while we&apos;re on the subject of pitch invaders, here&apos;s one from Saturn v Spartak Moscow in the Russian league over the weekend. Quite a tidy finish, we&apos;re sure you&apos;ll agree ... JD  11.10am: At the end of last season, the Liverpool website published the results of a poll showing fans&apos; favourite centre-back pairing. Daniel Agger and Jamie Carragher was first choice, followed closely by Agger and Martin Skrtel. This season, Liverpool have kept clean sheets only against Stoke, Burnley and Debrecen, and have conceded at least two goals in all their other games. A couple of seasons ago it would have been unheard of to drop Carragher from Liverpool&apos;s starting line-up, but after some shoddy defensive displays this season \u2013 here&apos;s Paul Doyle&apos;s verdict on the match at Upton Park on Saturday \u2013 is it time for Rafael Ben\u00edtez to turn to Agger, when fit, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and Daniel Ayala on a more frequent basis? PW  11.15am: Is Drew Brees the best quarterback in the NFL at the moment? Fox Sports certainly thinks so. Plus here&apos;s a report on the Giants&apos; late, late result to spoil the day for the Cowboys at their new home, including an unusually frank admission of culpability from Tony Romo:   &quot;Obviously my mistakes really put us in a hole. I really cost us this one. It&apos;s frustrating. I&apos;m just really, really disappointed in myself right now.&quot;   PW  12.10pm: The Football League has confirmed it is investigating the recent takeover of Notts County by Munto Finance. Mystery surrounds who is actually behind the group with the executive chairman Peter Trembling fronting the consortium of investors. A Football League spokesman said:  &quot;We have received fit and proper persons documentation. Discussions are ongoing with regard to the club&apos;s ownership structure.&quot;  Obviously, the club could face sanctions if they fail to identify the men behind the money being injected into the club. JD  1.05pm: We&apos;re still waiting on an update regarding the condition of British Saxo Bank cyclist Jonny Bellis, who is in a critical condition at an Italian hospital in the wake of a suspected scooter crash. According to a report in Cycling Weekly:  The 21 year-old from the Isle of Man was found at the side of the road by a security guard at 3.30am on Saturday morning. He was bleeding heavily from the nose but was later found to have suffered serious head injuries. He was taken to a local hospital and then transferred to the specialist Careggi hospital in Florence. Great Britain Under 23 Academy coach Max Sciandri is with him and Bellis&apos; parents have also traveled to Italy.  According to [Italian newspaper] il Tirreno, Bellis was returning to his flat in Quarrata on his scooter. Police are investigating the accident but it is unclear if Bellis was the victim of a hit and run because no skid marks were found. Bellis was wearing a helmet. British Cycling&apos;s Performance Director Dave Brailsford said in a statement: &quot;All our focus and attention right now is on Johnny and his family and ensuring that they are looked after and given the best possible care at this time.&quot;  JD  1.10pm: Renault have been given a two-year suspended ban for Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s deliberate crash at the Singapore GP, while Flavio Briatore has been banned from motor sport for life for his actions in Crashgate. The FIA said:   &quot;At an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council held in Paris on 21 September 2009, the Renault F1 team admitted that the team had conspired with its driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to cause a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, in breach of the International Sporting Code and F1 Sporting Regulations.&quot;  You can read the FIA&apos;s verdict in full here. JD  2.02pm: The first European football blogs of the day have landed. Paolo Bandini ponders Sampdoria&apos;s flying start to the season under Luigi Del Neri, and wonders whether a special offer from a local restaurant may have something to do with their success. Raphael Honigstein concentrates on the bottom end of the Bundesliga this week, charting the decline of Hertha, &apos;the shame of Berlin&apos;, and revealing why Bochum have finally parted ways with their manager, Marcel Koller. PW  2.25pm: Nelson Piquet Jr has just issued a statement in the wake of Renault&apos;s punishment:  &quot;I am relieved that the FIA investigation has now been concluded. Those now running the Renault F1 Team took the decision, as I did, that it is better that the truth be known and accept the consequences. The most positive thing to come from bringing this to the attention of the FIA is that nothing like it will ever happen again. I bitterly regret my actions to follow the orders I was given. I wish every day that I had not done it. &quot;I don&apos;t know how far my explanation will go to making people understand because for many being a racing driver is an amazing privilege, as it was for me. All I can tell you is that my situation at Renault turned into a nightmare. Having dreamed of being a Formula One driver and having worked so hard to get there, I found myself at the mercy of Mr Briatore. His true character, which had previously only been known to those he had treated like this in the past, is now known. &quot;Mr Briatore was my manager as well as the team boss, he had my future in his hands but he cared nothing for it. By the time of the Singapore GP he had isolated me and driven me to the lowest point I had ever reached in my life. Now that I am out of that situation I cannot believe that I agreed to the plan, but when it was put to me I felt that I was in no position to refuse. Listening now to Mr Briatore&apos;s reaction to my crash and hearing the comments he has made to the press over the last two weeks it is clear to me that I was simply being used by him then to be discarded and left to ridicule. &quot;As my final words on this matter, I would like to repeat that I am so sorry to those who work in Formula One (including the many good people at Renault) the fans and the governing body. I do not expect this to be forgiven or forgotten but at least now people can draw their conclusions based upon what really happened.&quot;  JD  3.06pm: A thanksgiving service for Sir Bobby Robson is taking place in Durham cathedral today, with the event broadcast live in St James&apos; Park and in Ipswich. We&apos;ll have audio and news from Paul Hayward and Louise Taylor later on. In the meantime, here&apos;s a gallery of the day&apos;s events. PW  3.43pm: It&apos;s this kind of story that makes you realise why the English game misses Jens Lehmann: the former Arsenal keeper has been dropped by Stuttgart for attending Oktoberfest - which starts in September for some reason - just a couple of hours after his team had lost 2-0 to Cologne. It wasn&apos;t the only entertainment Jens had provided at the weekend either: he gifted Cologne their second goal when he raced out of his area only to lose possession and allow Wilfried Sanou to shoot into an empty net from 45 yards out. Ah Jens, Jens, Jens: our loss is Germany&apos;s gain. TL  3.55pm: Fancy winning some Champions League tickets to see Arsenal take on Olympiakos next week? No? Then don&apos;t enter this competition and answer a question so simple that even we got the right answer at the second attempt. TL  4.55pm: Paul Hayward gave a reading at Sir Bobby Robson&apos;s memorial service today and spoke to Jon Dennis about the tribute to the former England manager.

Vote now in our poll\u2022 Read the full FIA statement on Crashgate\u2022 Paul Hayward: Sport has never been innocent Although unable to take action against Briatore personally, after he left Renault last week, the 26-member WMSC said it would not sanction any event involving him &quot;in any capacity whatsoever&quot;. It also said it would refuse to renew licences to any driver associated with Briatore in any capacity, meaning that all those managed by him will have to extricate themselves from their contracts. They include Alonso, Piquet, Mark Webber and Heikki Kovalainen. Formula One&apos;s governing body, the FIA, will be criticised by some for effectively letting Renault off the hook while pinning the blame on Briatore and Pat Symonds, Renault&apos;s former executive director of engineering who also quit last week. He was given a five-year ban from the sport. The FIA chairman, Max Mosley, said Renault had &quot;demonstrated that they had absolutely no moral responsibility for what took place&quot;. He added: &quot;That&apos;s to say Renault F1, the team, didn&apos;t know and still less of course does the company have any responsibility, [so] it would be wrong in the circumstances to impose an immediate penalty.&quot; The team&apos;s future still hangs in the balance. Asked after the hearing whether Renault would continue in Formula One, Mosley said they would. But Bernard Rey, the president of Renault F1, refused to confirm whether the team would remain involved beyond the end of the season. The WMSC said that while the offences merited &quot;permanent disqualification&quot; from Formula One, Renault were credited for admitting the charges, apologising unreservedly, confirming the departure of Briatore and Symonds, paying costs and making a &quot;significant contribution&quot; to safety projects. Symonds was banned for five years from working with any &quot;FIA-licensed event, championship, cup, trophy or series&quot;. The WMSC said the sentence given to Symonds was lighter than that given to Briatore because the former had admitted the offence, &quot;to his eternal regret and shame&quot;. Mosley, who will stand down from the FIA next month following a campaign against him in which Briatore was a prime mover, said the WMSC had made &quot;the right decision&quot;. &quot;I think the blame has been placed where the blame should be placed,&quot; he said. Asked what the affair, which has been called one of the worst ever examples of premeditated cheating in sporting history, meant for the future of Formula One, Mosley said: &quot;I don&apos;t think it means anything. I think we now go on. We have problems from time to time and as long as we solve them and deal with them properly that&apos;s fine.&quot; The decision will also call into question Briatore&apos;s joint ownership of the Championship football club Queens Park Rangers, because the Football League&apos;s rules ban those who have been disqualified by another sporting body under its fit and proper persons test. Piquet, who faces an uncertain future in the sport, said: &quot;The most positive thing to come from bringing this to the attention of the FIA is that nothing like it will ever happen again. I bitterly regret my actions to follow the orders I was given. I wish every day that I had not done it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/21/renault-fia-ban", "sentences": ["Renault can consider themselves extremely fortunate to have got away with a suspended ban for deliberately causing the crash at last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix that shocked Formula One, never mind the world at large, from top to bottom."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-21T17:00:32Z", "title": "Renault are lucky to get away with suspended ban", "tags": ["Renault", "Flavio Briatore", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Renault can consider themselves extremely fortunate to have got away with a suspended ban for deliberately causing the crash at last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix that shocked Formula One, never mind the world at large, from top to bottom. The FIA World Motor Sport Council considered the breaches relating to the race &quot;to be of unparalleled severity&quot;. Considering that the governing body campaigns strongly and successfully for safety in the sport, this is a curious decision, one that has been predicated on the fact that neither the parent company nor the team, Renault F1, had a moral responsibility for what happened when Nelson Piquet Jr was told to crash his car. On the one hand, a ban is the highest form of punishment available. But to suspend it is to give Renault a slap on the wrist and send them to bed early. By banning Flavio Briatore indefinitely, the FIA has made it clear the former Renault team principal is the villain along with, to a lesser degree, Pat Symonds, the chief engineer who was banned for five years. Nonetheless, it is surprising that Renault did not at least receive a fine for compromising the already battered integrity of F1. McLaren were handed what now appears an even more absurd $100m (\u00a362m) penalty for their involvement in the Ferrari &quot;Spygate&quot; scandal in 2007. The difference seems to be that McLaren did not admit to wrongdoing whereas Renault eventually declared their guilt and fired the two architects of the dishonourable act. The FIA&apos;s message would therefore appear to be that truth is worth $100m whereas forfeiting safety attracts a lower tariff, an unfortunate and surely erroneous message given the governing body&apos;s outstanding work in reducing the hazards associated with an inherently dangerous business. McLaren were also stripped of their points in the 2007 constructors&apos; championship. Renault were spared the indignity of forfeiting points earned last year and possibly having to pay back the $50m that came with finishing fourth in the series, penalties that might have hastened a departure from the sport, something the Renault board has been reviewing constantly during the past 18 months. By quitting, Renault would also jeopardise their contracts as engine suppliers, currently with Red Bull and, possibly for 2010, Williams. As if to underline the importance of contrition, the WMSC says it &quot;had regard not only to the severity of the breach in which Mr Briatore was complicit but also to his actions in continuing to deny his participation in the breach despite all the evidence&quot;. Apart from drivers, individuals in F1 do not hold licences but the FIA has dealt with that in Briatore&apos;s case by threatening to sanction any club, association or individual that might deal with him in the future. The ban has crushed Briatore completely by affecting his involvement not only with F1 but also GP2 and his management contracts with drivers such as Fernando Alonso, Mark Webber and Heikki Kovalainen. How this affects Briatore&apos;s association with Queens Park Rangers is for others to decide. While the sentence handed down to Renault is almost of no consequence, the punishment delivered to Briatore \u2013 and, to a lesser degree, Symonds \u2013 is a strong message to others in positions of tactical influence within the sport. Quite where this leaves Nelson Piquet Jr is difficult to say. The Brazilian&apos;s management contract with Briatore exposed the dilemma faced by a young driver whose talent did not appear sufficient to avoid accepting instructions to crash as a means of ensuring future employment. Had Piquet not spoken out, the matter would never have arisen and the majority in the F1 world, despite commenting at the time on the fortunate coincidence of the crash, would have gone on believing that such a thing could never have been engineered deliberately."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/21/renault-fia-punishment-future", "sentences": ["As an exercise in tying up loose ends before the F1 circus headed for the circuit that hosted the latest and most shocking in a string of controversies, yesterday&apos;s ruling on the Singapore scandal provided as many questions as answers."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-21T20:06:53Z", "title": "Renault's Formula One future in doubt despite lenient judgment", "tags": ["Renault", "Flavio Briatore", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Renault&apos;s long-term future in Formula One remained uncertain last night despite their having escaped serious punishment over the race-fixing scandal that has blackened the team&apos;s name. As an exercise in tying up loose ends before the F1 circus headed for the circuit that hosted the latest and most shocking in a string of controversies, yesterday&apos;s ruling on the Singapore scandal provided as many questions as answers. Some questioned the motives of the World Motor Sport Council&apos;s decision to mete out heavy punishments to the men responsible for ordering Nelson Piquet Jr to crash last year on the Marina Bay circuit, but impose no financial penalty on the team that employed them. Standing outside the FIA&apos;s headquarters in Place de la Concorde, its outgoing president Max Mosley said that Renault would remain in Formula One and made it plain where he felt responsibility for the scandal lay, arguing that Renault had &quot;demonstrated they had absolutely no moral responsibility for what took place&quot;. The WMSC accepted Renault&apos;s explanation that it was the flamboyant former team principal Flavio Briatore and the former executive director of engineering Pat Symonds who orchestrated the plot to order Piquet to crash for the benefit of his team-mate Fernando Alonso, who went on to win. But despite Mosley&apos;s unequivocal words Bernard Rey, the president of Renault F1, was less forthcoming. Rey was asked five times about the team&apos;s future, which has been in doubt for some time, but refused to answer, saying only: &quot;We apologise for such failure in front of the F1 community, and we hope we can put this behind us.&quot; In a statement the team added that it would &quot;issue further information in the next few days&quot;. Alonso, who was absolved of any blame, slipped away without commenting. Renault&apos;s admission of guilt, combined with its action in ensuring the departure of Briatore and Symonds and a series of contrite apologies, enabled it to escape with only a suspended sentence and no fine. It will pay costs and the parent group will make a &quot;significant contribution&quot; to the FIA&apos;s safety programme, although it is understood that will involve supplying expertise rather than any kind of financial investment. The lack of a heavy fine may help tip the balance in favour of Renault, which faced questions over its commitment long before the race fixing scandal came to light in July, remaining in the sport. The former world champion Damon Hill, now president of the British Racing Drivers&apos; Club, said there were broader forces at work. &quot;You can&apos;t escape from the suspicion that it was all very expedient, given that Briatore was also one of the ringleaders of the pressure group FOTA,&quot; he said. &quot;No one can excuse what happened to Piquet, it&apos;s totally abhorrent. That has been dealt with. [But] it&apos;s not the whole story. The whole story is that there has been a power struggle for a very long time and it&apos;s got to stop because it&apos;s ruining the sport. It&apos;s absolutely deplorable.&quot; In what may be his last hurrah before he is replaced next month as a result of the high-profile rebellion by leading teams earlier this year in which Briatore was a prime mover, Mosley insisted the long\u2011term health of the sport would not be harmed by the scandal. &quot;I don&apos;t think it means anything. I think we now go on,&quot; he said. &quot;We have problems from time to time and as long as we solve them and deal with them properly that&apos;s fine.&quot; The future plans of Briatore, who did not attend the hearing and is believed to be on holiday, are less clear. He was castigated in the judgment for not showing the level of contrition that enabled Symonds to escape with a five-year banishment, instead loudly protesting his innocence and accusing Piquet of being &quot;spoilt&quot;. It was the same strain of thinking that led to McLaren being fined $100m in 2007 and stripped of constructors&apos; points over the so-called &quot;spygate&quot; scandal, in large part because it refused to come clean and adopt a contrite pose. Briatore has management contracts with Alonso as well as Red Bull&apos;s Mark Webber, Renault&apos;s Romain Grosjean, McLaren&apos;s Heikki Kovalainen and Piquet. But the FIA said yesterday that it would not renew the annual Superlicence of any driver that remained with him. His close involvement in GP2 will also come to an end, with Renault having to find someone new to run the Formula One breeding ground as well as appointing a new team principal, while he is even banned from any track holding an FIA-affiliated event."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/21/renault-flavio-briatore-nelson-piquet-singapore", "sentences": ["Nelson Piquet Jr launched a savage attack on Flavio Briatore today after the former Renault team principal was effectively banned from motor sport for life for ordering him to crash in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix.", "&quot;By the time of the Singapore GP he had isolated me and driven me to the lowest point I had ever reached in my life."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-21T20:30:35Z", "title": "Nelson Piquet Jr accuses Flavio Briatore of driving him to lowest ebb", "tags": ["Renault", "Flavio Briatore", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Nelson Piquet Jr launched a savage attack on Flavio Briatore today after the former Renault team principal was effectively banned from motor sport for life for ordering him to crash in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix. While the Italian was permanently banned from any FIA sanctioned event by the 26 members of the World Motor Sport Council, his former team was given a green light to continue in the sport. Despite the FIA finding that Renault&apos;s disregard of the rules was of &quot;unparalleled severity&quot;, the team was handed only a two-year suspended ban and escaped any fine. Piquet, who blew the lid on the affair in July when he alleged Briatore had ordered him to crash into a wall on lap 14 of the race in order to hand an advantage to his team-mate Fernando Alonso, said in a statement after today&apos;s hearing in Paris that Briatore had driven him to his lowest ebb. \u2022 Maurice Hamilton on Renault&apos;s lucky escape\u2022 Has the FIA let Renault off too lightly?

Listening now to Mr Briatore&apos;s reaction to my crash and hearing the comments he has made to the press over the last two weeks it is clear to me that I was simply being used by him then to be discarded and left to ridicule.&quot; After Piquet had been sacked by Renault and gone to the FIA with his allegations, Briatore bullishly denied the claims and threatened to sue. The 59-year-old Italian, believed to be on holiday, said the Brazilian driver&apos;s claims were &quot;outrageous&quot; and called him &quot;a very spoiled guy&quot;. Speaking at length for the first time about his motivation for following the orders of Briatore and Pat Symonds, the former Renault executive director of engineering who was banned for five years, Piquet said: &quot;I bitterly regret my actions to follow the orders I was given. I wish every day that I had not done it.&quot; The former Renault driver, who said he wanted to return to Formula One, was unrelenting in his criticism of Briatore, whose 21-year career in the sport appears to be at an end. &quot;All I can tell you is that my situation at Renault turned into a nightmare. Having dreamed of being a Formula One driver and having worked so hard to get there, I found myself at the mercy of Mr Briatore,&quot; he said. &quot;His true character, which had previously only been known to those he had treated like this in the past, is now known.&quot; Although unable to take action against Briatore personally after he parted company with Renault last week, the 26 members of WMSC said it would not sanction any event involving him &quot;in any capacity whatsoever&quot;. It also said it would refuse to renew licences to any driver associated with Briatore in any capacity, meaning that all of those managed by him will have to extricate themselves from their contracts. The 59-year-old Italian, who did not attend the hearing, is the manager of Piquet and Alonso as well as Red Bull&apos;s Australian Mark Webber, Renault&apos;s Romain Grosjean and McLaren&apos;s Heikki Kovalainen. &quot;It&apos;s sad to see a career end like that, but what else could we do?&quot; said the FIA president, Max Mosley, who also chairs the WMSC. The WMSC said Symonds&apos;s sentence was lighter than Briatore&apos;s because he had admitted the offence &quot;to his eternal regret and shame&quot;. Mosley, who will stand down from the FIA next month, said the WMSC had made &quot;the right decision&quot;. He said: &quot;I think the blame has been placed where the blame should be placed.&quot; The FIA said because Renault had admitted to conspiring with Piquet to cause a &quot;deliberate crash&quot;, had ensured Briatore and Symonds quit, apologised unreservedly and agreed to pay costs it would only be disqualified if it was found guilty of a &quot;comparable offence&quot; before the end of 2011. Alonso, who appeared at the hearing, was absolved of any knowledge of the plot and is tipped to join Ferrari. The decision also calls into question Briatore&apos;s joint ownership of the Championship football side Queens Park Rangers because the Football League&apos;s rules ban those who have been disqualified by another sporting body under its fit and proper persons test.

The Mirror also reveals that Tottenham are &quot;tracking&quot; Sampdoria&apos;s Spanish teenage midfielder Pedro Mba Obiang. Whether this is through the use of GPS, or an old native American indian who hunkers down, touches blades of grass, sniffs the air and points a lot remains unclear. Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest both want a loan of Leon Cort, but Stoke City manager Tony Pulis is keeping the defender at the Britannia Stadium as cover after lending Andrew Davies to Sheffield United. Meanwhile at Goodison Park, David Moyes is pulling a stocking-mask over his head and loading up his sawn-off shotgun in preperation for his January &quot;raid&quot; on the Priestfield Stadium for Gillingham striker Simeon Jackson. The Scottish FA chief, Uefa big cheese and card-carrying member of the Eduardo fan club Gordon Smith has called for Gary McAllister to be installed as Scotland manager George Burley&apos;s No2, while Sheffield United are ready to rescue the career of French striker Fabrice Pancrate from the doldrums by offering him a contract. The free agent&apos;s confidence couldn&apos;t be at a much lower ebb, considering he was rejected by goalshy Premier League propper-uppers Portsmouth after a trial. One player without portfolio who has got antennae twitching at Pompey is the former Manchester City defender and West End musical star Michael Ball, who appears to have sparked something of a bidding war between the south coast club and Galatasaray.

Legal experts told the Guardian that it is &quot;not cut and dried&quot; that the League&apos;s regulations would allow it to remove Briatore. The Italian resigned from Renault last week, after the driver Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s admission that Briatore had ordered him to crash at last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix, in order to boost the chances of his team-mate, Fernando Alonso. Yesterday in Paris, the FIA found that Briatore should be banned from Formula One for life. However, the Italian was no longer with Renault when the governing body held its hearing, and so no longer fell under its jurisdiction. This meant the FIA could not ban him directly. Instead, it ruled that anyone associated with Briatore would not be licensed. &quot;There is a question mark over whether he&apos;s actually been banned. What the FIA have done is threaten not to sanction anyone engaging Briatore or allow them to take part in any FIA-organised championships or events,&quot; said Jonathan Brogden, a partner in the City sports law firm Davies Arnold Cooper. &quot;So Briatore may be able to claim he, personally, has not been banned. As regards the fit and proper person test, one of the things you have to declare is that you&apos;ve not been banned by a sports governing body from involvement in the administration of that sport. &quot;The question arises as to whether Briatore has actually been banned from the administration of Formula One. All we&apos;ve got to go on at the moment is the press release and that strongly suggests that Briatore himself is not banned from being involved. It&apos;s a de facto ban but it&apos;s\u00a0questionable as to whether it&apos;s a personal ban.&quot; This view was echoed by Paul Gilbert, a leading sports lawyer who advised the Australian umpire Darrell Hair during his action against the International Cricket Council in 2007. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t have said that it is cut and dried because the League [regulation] is clearly aimed at finding against an individual following a proper process where evidence as been heard, a judgment has been arrived at and that person has the opportunity to appeal. In relation to Briatore that hasn&apos;t happened, he hasn&apos;t been heard on this. He resigned.&quot; The Italian reportedly said today that he is considering legal action against the FIA. If the League decides that Briatore fails its fit and proper person test, he would have to sell his share of the ownership of QPR, as well as stand down from any executive position with the club. If he was not to do so, QPR would face exclusion. Brogden said: &quot;If QPR don&apos;t exclude him or remove him as a director and the Football League consider him not a fit and proper person then its ultimate sanction is to exclude QPR from all competitions. They would need to go through a process, which includes the service of notices.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/22/flavio-briatore-legal-action-fia", "sentences": ["The witness, who was not part of the conspiracy to stage a crash at the 2008 Singapore grand prix, came to light during Renault&apos;s internal investigation.", "The verdict is fair and everyone is a winner.&quot; Apart from appearing to suggest the matter had been settled before the court sat yesterday, Ben Sulayem also hints that wider considerations than Briatore&apos;s role in fixing last year&apos;s Singapore race played a part.", "&quot;On that night in Singapore last year I made a mistake the consequences of which I could never have imagined at the time."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-22T18:39:46Z", "title": "First Abu Dhabi grand prix needed Renault to compete, says FIA vice-president", "tags": ["Flavio Briatore", "Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "As Flavio Briatore today considered legal action over his de facto life ban from motor sport, it emerged that his fate had been sealed by a whistleblower from his Renault team codenamed &quot;Witness X&quot;.

The FIA became aware of his existence last Thursday, when Renault supplied additional documents. After being granted anonymity \u2013 only the FIA president, Max Mosley, and the body&apos;s legal advisers know his name \u2013 Witness X was interviewed by a member of the FIA&apos;s external counsel. Renault then made a third and final set of written submissions on Saturday, which said: &quot;Renault F1 has concluded that the following had knowledge of the conspiracy to cause a safety car: Nelson Piquet Jr, Pat Symonds [the then head of engineering], Flavio Briatore and Witness X. &quot;Witness X was told of the idea suggested by Nelson Piquet Jr by Mr Symonds, whilst in the presence of Mr Briatore.

He has said that the idea to crash was proposed to him by Symonds, in Briatore&apos;s presence. In a letter to the members of the WMSC before the hearing, Symonds wrote: &quot;The idea for this incident was entirely conceived by Nelson Piquet Jr. It was he who first approached me with the idea. At the time I naively believed that it was something he wanted to do for the good of the team. I was not aware of the position of his contract negotiations although with the benefit of hindsight I now consider that he believed his actions would have a favourable effect on these negotiations.&quot; Symonds said he had not expected Piquet to crash in &quot;a reckless fashion&quot; but admitted: &quot;I was the one who, when the idea was first suggested to me by Nelson Piquet Jr, should have dismissed it immediately. It is to my eternal regret and shame I did not do so. I can only say I did it out of a misguided devotion to my team and not for any personal gain whatsoever. I consider the role I have played in bringing the team to where it is today to be my life&apos;s work. In a single action I have destroyed the high reputation I have built up during a 33-year career in motor sport. &quot;On that night in Singapore last year I made a mistake the consequences of which I could never have imagined at the time. For that mistake I can only offer all of you, and all those touched by the action I was involved in, my profound apology.&quot; Briatore has said he wants to prove his innocence and win compensation for damage to his image. &quot;I am distraught,&quot; the 59-year-old Italian was quoted as saying by Gazzetta dello Sport. Carlos Gracia, head of the Spanish motor sport federation and a member of the WMSC, said of Briatore&apos;s punishment: &quot;It seems to me excessive. There was no clear proof against him and he was not able to defend himself either.&quot; &quot;Moreover, I wouldn&apos;t rule out him going to ordinary justice because he has been left without his means of earning a living.&quot; The sports lawyer Stephen Hornsby, a partner at Davenport Lyons, said: &quot;All lifetime bans in sport are difficult.

Piquet, whose former Renault team have confirmed that they will continue in Formula One, is regarded by many in the business as damaged goods after he deliberately crashed his car here a year ago to help his then team-mate, Fernando Alonso, who went on to win. But he is being considered as a candidate for one of the new teams entering the sport next season, not so much for his qualities as a driver but because of the sponsorship he may be able to raise from Brazilian sources through his father, Nelson Piquet Sr, a multi-millionaire and former triple world champion. Manor Grand Prix, Team US F1, Campos and Lotus have been confirmed as fresh entries for 2010. Piquet&apos;s appeal to one of the new teams will be enhanced considerably by his father&apos;s willingness to spend large sums of money in supporting his son&apos;s ambition. Ever since the younger Piquet moved out of karting, his father has funded his motor racing, with a tailor-made team revolving exclusively around the youngster in both Formula Three and GP2. &quot;You might think Piquet would be a bit of a pariah in the pit lane after all this unfavourable publicity, but I do not think that&apos;s precisely the case,&quot; said one highly-placed Formula One insider who worked with Piquet Sr when the Brazilian first won the world championship in 1981 driving for the Bernie Ecclestone-owned Brabham team. &quot;Nelson&apos;s father is incredibly well-connected and I can&apos;t see many of those new teams turning away sponsorship even if it means having the kid on board.&quot; Piquet Jr&apos;s hopes of a return have been backed by Lewis Hamilton. &quot;He&apos;s a good driver and he&apos;s had a great career, so who knows?&quot; the world champion said. &quot;For sure, there are opportunities for him in the future and I can only wish him the best.&quot; Piquet Jr&apos;s involvement in the race-fixing scandal here a year ago was still reverberating around the pit lane today at the Marina Bay circuit. He remains a controversial personality even after the FIA, world motor sport&apos;s governing body, granted him immunity from prosecution for blowing the whistle on Renault&apos;s former team principal, Flavio Briatore, and Pat Symonds, the former executive director of engineering, both of whom left last week. Piquet has said the idea to crash was put to him by Symonds in Briatore&apos;s presence. But Symonds told the World Motor Sport Council in a letter that Piquet Jr suggested initiating a deliberate accident for tactical reasons. Renault confirmed they will continue despite the race-fixing controversy, which led to them receiving a suspended disqualification. The team have also withdrawn the complaint made against the Piquets of false allegations and blackmail. &quot;Renault F1 and its parent company have given serious consideration as to whether it should remain in the sport following the prejudice caused to its corporate image by the conspiracy, in addition to the existing background of financial pressures that have caused car manufacturers to withdraw,&quot; the team said. &quot;But it has concluded that it would like to remain in Formula One and continue to make an important contribution to the sport.&quot; Renault today announced that their technical director, Bob Bell, will take over as acting team principal from Briatore, who has received a de facto life ban from motor sport. &quot;Bob Bell will attend all the remaining races of the season and will be the team&apos;s spokesperson on all sporting and technical matters,&quot; the team said. Bell will also be the team&apos;s chief technical officer. The decision to give Renault no more than a suspended disqualification has provoked criticism from some quarters. But Niki Lauda, a three-time world champion who drove alongside Piquet Sr in the Brabham team during the 1979 season, believes that the FIA got their judgment correct. Lauda, who has just become a father again at the age of 60 with the birth of twin son and daughter last week, said that in his view the Renault company proved successfully they had nothing to do with the actions of a handful of miscreants in their midst. &quot;A lot of people seem to be drawing parallels between this business and the controversy surrounding McLaren in 2008 when they were fined 100million dollars for illegally obtaining technical information from Ferrari,&quot; he said. &quot;In that case McLaren disputed the issue right up until the end whereas Renault on this occasion have put their hands up, admitted that there was no defence to the crime and taken their punishment in a straightforward manner. I really don&apos;t think the two issues are similar at all.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/24/corruption-sport-betting-lawrence-donegan", "sentences": ["Blabbering Bernie turns Formula One into a sham Gone are the days when anything sensible might have been expected to come out of Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s mouth but the man who runs Formula One surpassed \u2013 or rather embarrassed \u2013 even himself with his suggestion that Flavio Briatore was harshly treated when he banned indefinitely by the FIA for his role in trying to fix the result of last year&apos;s Singapore Ggrand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-23T23:10:00Z", "title": "Bookies should stump up for betting's unwanted side-effects | Lawrence Donegan", "tags": ["Sport betting", "Sport"], "article": "Like fast-talking bookies and spineless politicians, corruption in sport has been around since the dawn of time. It is everywhere; from the autobiography of Matt Le Tissier to bowls, where New Zealand&apos;s governing body is investigating claims that its team at last month&apos;s Asia-Pacific Championship deliberately threw a match against Thailand. Meanwhile, journeying across European football is like touring through the heart of darkness. Match-fixing scandals are like rousing anthems: every country has got one. Yet if all corruption damages the credibility of sport, not all corruption is the same. Think of it like an evangelist would think about man&apos;s imperfections \u2013 some of our failings we are born with and cannot escape; some of them are artificial, the self-indulgent in pursuit of the self-destructive. The allegation of corruption against the New Zealand bowls team falls into the first category. According to those making the accusations (the pesky Canadians) the motivation was not greed or money, but the prospect of a better draw in the next stage of the tournament. Nothing has been proved but if the claims are found to be true what else could we do other than shake our head and wonder that if not bowls, what exactly is sacred these days? Le Tissier&apos;s effort to make a few quid on the timing of the first thrown-in, on the other hand, is the perfect example of self-indulgence; a petty, man-made corruption. Would he have tried his little scam 50 years ago, before an ingenious bookie had dreamt up the concept of novelty bets in an attempt to part mug punters from even more of their money? This distinction lies at the heart of the attempts by sporting bodies like the British Horseracing Authority to have the bookies fund the battle against sporting corruption, and the attempts of bookmakers like Betfair to keep their profits to themselves. Admittedly, this is not a sexy debate but that is because it is has been buried beneath a dungheap of cowardice (from politicians), bureaucratic incompetence (from sporting bodies) and wilful obstruction (from bookies). The subject seems complex when, in fact, it is very simple indeed; if sport is corrupt, why is it corrupt? The bookies would like us to believe that sport is corrupt because it has always been corrupt, but, as Le Tissier proved, this simply isn&apos;t true. Temptation, and those who present the temptation, must bear some responsibility. The expansion in the gambling industry in recent years, particularly on the exchanges, has also seen an explosion in the opportunity for those seeking to manipulate sporting outcomes, or take advantage of &quot;insider knowledge&quot;. Sure, the exchanges have afforded a degree of transparency in recent years. But how many instances of sporting corruption have been conclusively proved? Not many. So exactly how useful has this new transparency been? Not much. &quot;I think they&apos;re after something for nothing,&quot; Mark Davies of Betfair said yesterday of the sporting bodies&apos; efforts to have a levy imposed on the bookies to help combat corruption. Even in the context of high-stakes political argument, this is breathtaking. If Mr Davies was caught spray-painting the walls of the BHA&apos;s headquarters would he refuse to help pay for the clean-up? Likewise, if the expansion in the betting industry increased the opportunity for corruption (as it has) should not the betting industry pay something towards the cost of combating said problem? As this paper reported yesterday, the debate will now go before a panel set up by the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, to investigate the subject of sporting integrity. If there is one thing to be learned from repeated viewings of The Thick of It on DVD it is that as soon as any issue goes before an inquiry it stands about as much chance of achieving resolution as Malcolm Tucker&apos;s anger management problems. So let me take a guess at what will eventually emerge from Mr Sutcliffe&apos;s panel: nothing much. Let us face it, the bookmakers are too powerful and they contribute too much to the British economy in terms of job creation and in tax revenues. I guess that is what is called grown-up politics. I guess, too, that we will have to live with that but it is worth noting the only people who want something for nothing are the bookies who make a fortune off the back of sport and are refusing to give anything back. Flip-flops become standard attire for golf in Dubai  The world of sports sponsorship has never been a place for those with high hopes for the soul of mankind but, even so, one is occasionally left speechless in such circles. One such occasion came earlier this week with the confirmation that the prize money for golf&apos;s race to Dubai was to be cut by 25%. &quot;We look forward to staging an excellent Dubai World Championship in November,&quot; said Hamza Mustafa, managing director of the tournament sponsor Nakheel and the man who broke the bad news. This would be the same Hamza Mustafa who, when asked in the summer if his company was about to cut the prize fund for golf&apos;s so-called richest event, said: &quot;No one is immune from this downturn, but we have recently reaffirmed to the European Tour that we stand by our commitment to the deal on the same terms.&quot; Maybe there is a plausible explanation for Nakheel&apos;s decision to go back on its word, but while we wait for it to arrive, we will have to content ourselves with a bold prediction \u2013 this year&apos;s inaugural Dubai World Championship will be the first and the last. If I&apos;m wrong, Mr Mustafa is welcome to the contents of my bank account. Unless I change my mind, of course. Blabbering Bernie turns Formula One into a sham Gone are the days when anything sensible might have been expected to come out of Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s mouth but the man who runs Formula One surpassed \u2013 or rather embarrassed \u2013 even himself with his suggestion that Flavio Briatore was harshly treated when he banned indefinitely by the FIA for his role in trying to fix the result of last year&apos;s Singapore Ggrand prix. &quot;I feel very sorry for him,&quot; said Bernie of his friend, Flavio. &quot;I thought the punishment was probably a bit harsh but I don&apos;t know how it can be changed. I don&apos;t think he deserved it. I think he should have had his hand slapped.&quot; So let&apos;s get this straight; a team owner conspires in a plan to have one of his own drivers crash in order help another of his drivers, thereby endangering his own driver (as well as those drivers around him) and defrauding the poor fools who bought tickets, as well as the television companies who paid fortunes to broadcast this sham of a sport. And, according to Mr F1, his punishment should have been to have his hand slapped? As I said \u2013 a sham of a sport. Cautionary tale of why sex may not mix with cricket A cautionary word or three in the ear of India&apos;s cricket squad, who have apparently been advised by their fitness coach to have more sex as a means of improving their batting, bowling and fielding; don&apos;t go overboard. Yes, it is difficult but should temptation prove well-nigh impossible to resist perhaps it would be worth carrying around a photograph of the former Olympic sprinter Dennis Mitchell, who was banned after testing positive of excessive testosterone in his system. His excuse? He had drunk five beers and had had sex with his wife four times. &quot;It was her birthday. The lady deserved a treat.&quot; Alas it didn&apos;t work for Mitchell.

The US state department confirmed today that the new strategy, while keeping sanctions in place, will involve high-level engagement with Burmese leaders, in line with Barack Obama&apos;s policy of talking with countries it regards as international pariahs. In contrast with George Bush&apos;s administration, Obama has offered to hold direct talks with Iran and North Korea. The shift was signalled on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York last night when the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said America will move &quot;in the direction of both engagement and continued sanctions&quot;. Speaking to foreign ministers at a Friends of Burma meeting, she said: &quot;Engagement versus sanctions is a false choice in our opinion. So we will be employing both of those tools ... to help achieve democratic reform we will be engaging directly with Burmese authorities.&quot; The sanctions, imposed by the EU and US, would be eased if the junta moved towards significant reform, she added. The US is pushing for the introduction of democracy and the release of the opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Supporters of the Nobel Peace prize winner gave the policy shift a cautious welcome. Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, which is campaigning for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, said: &quot;We are glad the Obama administration is turning its attention to Burma. It is time for a multifaceted approach.&quot; She questioned the value of engagement if it involved only the US and the junta. The strategy shift comes at the end of a policy review on Burma ordered by Clinton is February. It coincides with a visit to the UN general assembly by the Burmese leader, Than Shwe, the first senior member of the junta to attend for 14 years. To try to ease criticism of the country&apos;s human rights record, the junta last week declared an amnesty for about 7,000 prisoners. The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, said the amnesty fell &quot;short of expectations&quot;. Human rights groups estimate Burma has 2,200 political prisoners. Ban, speaking after the meeting with Clinton, said next year will be critical for Burma, when it is scheduled to hold an election. Opposition groups have already labelled the poll a sham. A US official familiar with the new policy said that when Clinton ordered the review she said that neither sanctions or the policy of engagement by the regional body the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Burma is a member, had worked.  The official said: &quot;Sanctions remain important ... they have not produced the results we would like, but that does not mean they don&apos;t have value. The official was speaking off-the-record because members of Congress had still to be briefed on the change. They were to be given details later. The official, noting that the junta had been in power for more than four decades, said: &quot;I have to stress we&apos;re going into this with eyes wide open. We&apos;re not expecting dramatic, immediate results but we think that going forward with a more nuanced approach that focuses on trying to achieve results and that&apos;s based on pragmatism, it increases the chances of success over time.&quot; Although the US and Burma have diplomatic relations, the official said the contact would be at a higher level than before, and that Burma and the US would soon appoint figures to act as interlocutors. The official said the review would have been completed sooner but had been delayed to await the outcome after the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi in August after an American swam across a lagoon to where she was under house arrest. She was sentenced to three years, later commuted to a further 18 months of house arrest.  The policy shift comes after the US senator, Jim Webb, visited Burma last month to meet senior members of the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi, the highest level visit by the US in years. Singapore&apos;s foreign minister, George Yeo, said re-engagement &quot;will enable the US and Europe to have more influence in the political evolution of the country&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/24/lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg-mclaren", "sentences": ["Lewis Hamilton, third in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix behind Nico Rosberg&apos;s Williams, was cautious when it came to speculation over rumours Rosberg might be his team-mate in the McLaren-Mercedes team next season."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-24T18:01:48Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton keeps Nico Rosberg guessing on McLaren move", "tags": ["Nico Rosberg", "Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton, third in last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix behind Nico Rosberg&apos;s Williams, was cautious when it came to speculation over rumours Rosberg might be his team-mate in the McLaren-Mercedes team next season.

No one else was involved. Those three people have now been dealt with \u2013 in my view [in Briatore&apos;s case] quite harshly. I don&apos;t think it was necessary but I was on the [World Motor Sport Council] commission so I am probably as guilty as anyone else. On reflection it wasn&apos;t necessary. &quot;Honestly I am a friend of Flavio&apos;s. He has just handled the whole thing badly. Flavio should have accepted the invitation to the hearing. He should have stood up and said, &apos;I was caught with my hand in the till, it seemed like a good idea at the time and I am sorry.&apos; He would have got a slap across the wrist and that would have been the end of it.&quot; Ecclestone also warned Briatore not to take the matter to a civil court. &quot;It would be stupid of Flavio to do that. He should ask to be heard by the court of appeal. He should appeal to the FIA. If he goes to a civil court, I don&apos;t think he would win because the FIA would have to defend and somebody will say that he sent a young guy out to what could have been his death. So it wouldn&apos;t go down too well.&quot; Briatore received backing from another quarter today, when Mark Webber leapt to his support, praising the job the Italian businessman did as his long-term manager and vowing that he would rather do without a manager in the future if he could not use Briatore. As part of Briatore&apos;s FIA punishment, any driver managed by him will not receive their mandatory super licence from the FIA unless they sever all links with his management company. &quot;I have had Flavio looking after me for 11 years now,&quot; said Webber, who is fourth in the drivers&apos; world championship with four races to go. &quot;I never looked at my contract since I first signed it in the first year. He has been sensational for me and I won&apos;t work with anybody else in the future if I can&apos;t work with him. He is a very good character for our sport and a lot agree with that. It doesn&apos;t seem he will be around for a good while but that&apos;s the way it is.&quot; Renault were dealt two further blows yesterday. The team&apos;s title sponsor, ING, had planned to pull out at the end of the season but the company said it was ending its contract with immediate effect \u2013 four races early \u2013 due to the race-fixing controversy. The Spanish insurer Mutua Madrilena also withdrew its sponsorship, although the company said the decision would have no impact on its sponsorship of Fernando Alonso after he was cleared of involvement. &quot;Mutua Madrilena believes the conduct of the relevant people in the team was of extraordinary seriousness and not only compromised the integrity of the sport but also put the physical safety of spectators, drivers and circuit personnel at risk,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;This could affect the image, reputation and good name of the team&apos;s sponsors.&quot; The company told Renault to remove its name from the team&apos;s cars with immediate effect. Alonso himself was on the defensive here today, describing his 2008 Singapore grand prix win as a proper victory. &quot;I regard it as a [proper] win,&quot; said Alonso, who benefited from his then team-mate Piquet&apos;s deliberate crash into a wall. &quot;Piquet&apos;s crash was in the early stages of a race which had a very long way to go. The car was performing well and I did not make any mistakes.&quot; Piquet admitted any comeback to the sport may be overshadowed by his role in the affair. &quot;I am aware that because of this [scandal] it will be difficult. Some people will be afraid that the same thing will happen. But it was a unique case and I have learned from it. If I can&apos;t find a place in Formula One, perhaps for one year I will go to America and try to do a good job there until the waves have calmed down a bit.&quot; Alonso was absolved of any responsibility or involvement in the race fixing row which ended last week when Flavio Briatore, the Renault team&apos;s managing director, was suspended indefinitely from any involvement in FIA-sanctioned motor sport and his former executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds, received a five year ban. Piquet received an amnesty from prosecution after tipping off the governing body about the conspiracy after being fired by Briatore last month. No matter how much effort is expended to douse the flames of speculation, the whole issue of Briatore and the Renault team&apos;s transgression continued to occupy centre stage in the paddock here at the Marina Park circuit. And nNot all of it was critical. While Singapore was buzzing with frenzied anticipation in the run-up to its second grand prix, prospects for Donington Park and its hopes of staging next year&apos;s British round of the world championship seem to have faded further with the news that Ecclestone has extended by three days their end-of-month-deadline to demonstrate that they have the necessary funding in place and can complete their circuit upgrade in time. Asked if they would meet the deadline, Ecclestone said; &quot;I honestly don&apos;t know. I hope so. The problem is a financial one, getting their money together. Everything was done and ready when the financial crisis arrived and the banks pulled the plug on them.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/25/ari-vatanen-max-mosley-fia-president", "sentences": ["With four weeks to go until the 23 October election, the lobbying will intensify this weekend in Singapore where Todt, who has maintained a low profile, is set to meet the Formula One Teams&apos; Association.", "I don&apos;t seem to have seen these papers.&quot; The Finn, en route to the airport to collect his son before heading to Singapore and then on to a campaign trail that takes in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, has presented himself as the reforming candidate that can save Formula One from itself."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-24T23:10:01Z", "title": "Ari Vatanen's peasant revolt gathers momentum to end the Max Mosley era", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "The fallout from Monday&apos;s Crashgate verdict has raised the stakes in the race to succeed Max Mosley as the president of motor sport&apos;s world governing body, the FIA. Like anyone in the sport Ari Vatanen has strong views on the verdict and what it says about Formula One and those who run it. But unlike most, the former world rally champion and MEP could soon be in a position to do something about it. Four weeks today he will take on Mosley&apos;s favoured candidate, Jean Todt, who presided over Ferrari&apos;s most successful period between 2000 and 2004, as the FIA&apos;s 122-member associations cast their votes. If Vatanen is running on a change ticket, Todt is the continuity candidate. Vatanen casts himself as the white knight who can cleanse Formula One&apos;s blackened soul: &quot;People are looking for that vacuum to be filled \u2013 a lack of integrity, a lack of democracy and a lack of normal functioning,&quot; he says. On Crashgate, Vatanen thinks Nelson Piquet Jr should have been punished too and that a lifetime ban for Flavio Briatore seems &quot;very harsh&quot;. But, like others in the sport, his main concern is not with the outcome but the process. &quot;It is not done by independent justice, that is the bottom line.&quot; The election was sparked earlier this season when the teams forced Mosley to promise he would step down in return for dropping plans for a breakaway series. Vatanen has been outspoken in his criticism of the fact that Todt has received the endorsement of Mosley and that Richard Woods, the FIA&apos;s spin doctor, has stepped down from his post to run the former Ferrari chief&apos;s campaign. With four weeks to go until the 23 October election, the lobbying will intensify this weekend in Singapore where Todt, who has maintained a low profile, is set to meet the Formula One Teams&apos; Association. Mosley raised the stakes this week when he said of Vatanen: &quot;You&apos;ve no experience, you&apos;ve never run anything, you&apos;ve never been in charge of even the smallest organisation, you have no concept of what it is like. You didn&apos;t even run your own rally car, you had a co-driver to do that, so I cannot support you.&quot; Vatanen responds carefully: &quot;Over a long period of time in any organisation, if it hasn&apos;t upheld checks and balances, it inevitably moulds around the leader and the values of the leader.&quot; He claims the FIA might split in two if he does not win with some of the biggest clubs including the Automobile Association of America, a strong critic of Mosley, breaking away in frustration. &quot;When the big clubs go away, they go away. It will be a real pity if the FIA break into two. Max is playing with fire. Is that the legacy he wants to leave?&quot; Vatanen also claims that Formula One is in danger, with the fractured relationship between the teams and the governing body leaving sponsors and manufacturers unable to take long-term investment decisions. &quot;The sport is suffering and it is not developing. Who can give Formula One a clean bill of health? Nobody. Whether it&apos;s Bernie or anyone else, there must be even powers around the table. There must be a revolution. There is more at stake than people realise.&quot; He bemoans the lack of any long-term strategy for the sport or the organisation that governs it. &quot;Have you ever seen a strategy for Formula One for the next 10 to 15 years? The strategy for the World Rally Championship for the next 10 to 15 years? The strategy for the FIA in a fast-moving and evolving world for the next 10 years? I don&apos;t seem to have seen these papers.&quot; The Finn, en route to the airport to collect his son before heading to Singapore and then on to a campaign trail that takes in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, has presented himself as the reforming candidate that can save Formula One from itself. &quot;It is an incredibly powerful and brilliant piece of sport and entertainment. But it still plays with the rules. Some are granted rights and some are on the receiving end. Obviously it can&apos;t continue like that,&quot; he says. &quot;If our sport does well, then everyone will do well - television rights, owners, promoters, FOTA. If it is run in a healthy manner then maybe the ordinary family father with three kids can afford to pay for the tickets.&quot; In another less than veiled dig at Mosley, he says that he will not use his power for &quot;personal interest&quot; but for the greater good. With an eye on the member associations that will decide his fate, he is also keen to emphasise the Paris-based organisation&apos;s broader role. &quot;Formula One is only 20 people. We have got 100m motorists throughout the world and hundreds of millions to come. Think about this incredible FIA family. We are united by the passion of automobiles, whether it&apos;s old or fast, big or small. We are united by the passion,&quot; he says. &quot;It is the same attitude I have brought to everything. I brake late \u2013 that leaves no time for opportunism and cynical political calculations.&quot; Many in the sport assume Todt will prevail, given the influence wielded by Mosley and Ecclestone and their ability to bend events to their will, but Vatanen says he is supremely confident as the list of member associations who say they will back him grows. &quot;Now the majority is coming to realise it can be done. Look at slavery or anything else. I&apos;m not comparing this to slavery, not at all,&quot; he says. &quot;But it always starts with a few individuals and we all have a judgment of what is right and what is wrong. But if you feel totally powerless and that if you raise your head it is taken off... Now people see that a critical mass is gathering.&quot; If votes were awarded for stirring rhetoric, the Finn would surely be home and dry. &quot;It is like any other election campaign where people simply want to be liberated from the iron gates of the past. The tide has turned. All of Max&apos;s troops are mobilised, he is contacting everyone and flying here, there and everywhere. That will work in our favour because you can&apos;t swim against the current and the current is with us now.&quot; But as numerous opponents of Mosley have found over the years to their cost, in Formula One it is rarely that simple.

Welcome to our live coverage of the  ongoing humiliation of England&apos;s one-day team  the Champions Trophy.  I&apos;ve been away on holiday for the last two weeks, in which time England&apos;s one day team seems to have made an impressive transition from merely mediocre to truly and utterly despicable.  &quot;The truth of it is with England that you&apos;re never sure which side is going to turn up&quot; Charles Colville assures us in a vain but futile effort to convince England fans that they shouldn&apos;t give up on their side&apos;s chances already.  The one thing in England&apos;s favour, or so Atherton and Hussain try to convince us, is that conditions at the Wanderers are looking &quot;quite English&quot;. The pitch is green, and should allow some seam movement. England have won the toss and decided to bowl first. Given that that means they&apos;ll be batting under lights in the dew later on, we&apos;ll most likely know the result of this game inside the first fifteen overs of the first innings. Sangakkara insists he would have batted first anyway.  Steve Rackett has captured the prevailing tone in the very first email of the day: &quot;It&apos;s just a question of how much England are going to be stuffed by in today&apos;s match isn&apos;t it? Earlier in the year they barely scraped past Ireland and got a T20 beating by Holland, so they aren&apos;t even the best team in Europe? They could always do what our tennis team did and get related to Euro Division Two, and get some games against the likes of Italy and Denmark.&quot;  &quot;The pitch&quot; Bob Willis tells us, &quot;is a fast bowling paradise. And,&quot; he adds, &quot;the conditions are perfect for bowling in.&quot;  &quot;It looks like God has decided he&apos;s an Englishman today&quot; suggests Colville.  The ability of England fans to muster blind hope against even the most miserable circumstance remains remarkable.  &quot;Hope you had a good holiday&quot; begins Max Tant. Indeed I did Max, I spent a lot of time in Japan watching baseball and sumo, both of which activities were considerably more entertaining than sitting an office writing a liveblog about England being whupped at one-day cricket. Anyway, Max continues: &quot;I&apos;m really looking forward to today&apos;s game, not for the cricket, which would register as only mildly interesting even if these two teams were equally matched, but for the excuses England will come out with for their dire display and the look of barely restrained contempt from Andy Flower in his interviews. There are other sub-plots to keep it interesting in the meantime too: 1) Bopara&apos;s increasing ineptitude 2) Shah&apos;s collection of bizarre dismissals and 3) England&apos;s continuing justification for picking this clearly sub-standard side.&quot;  Anyway. At least one of those sub-plots seems to have reached a sorry conclusion before the match has even started, because Ravi Bopara has been left out. In his absence England look like this: AJ Strauss, JL Denly, OA Shah, PD Collingwood, EJG Morgan, MJ Prior, LJ Wright, SCJ Broad, GP Swann, G Onions, JM Anderson.  While Sri Lanka look like this: TM Dilshan, ST Jayasuriya, KC Sangakkara, DPMD Jayawardene, SHT Kandamby, TT Samaraweera, AD Mathews, KMDN Kulasekara, M Muralitharan, SL Malinga, BAW Mendis.  &quot;I&apos;m big on blind faith generally&quot; pipes up Sara Torvalds, &quot;(until proven utterly wrong, often in the first three overs or so), but even my faith is tested by this one-day side. I mean, are they all even fit to play? How is Stuart Broad&apos;s neck? Or was that &apos;strain&apos; just an euphemism for &apos;I have absolutely no faith in my team mates and I&apos;d rather not play quite that many losing games on the trot&apos;?&quot;  I owe a hearty &quot;so long&quot; and a gold-plated carriage clock to Larry Booth, the godfather of cricket at GU, and the man responsible for getting me a job here many moons ago. Yes, blame him. Booth, you&apos;re a peerless all round cricket writer and you&apos;ll be missed. Especially so because I&apos;ll surely have to do more solo through-the-night OBO shifts now you&apos;re gone.  1st over: Sri Lanka 1-0 (Dilshan 1, Jayasuriya 0) Anderson opens with two fizzing deliveries outside Dilshan&apos;s off-stump. His third is all-but-unplayable, pitching on off and ripping away past the outside edge. &quot;I don&apos;t know why Sky are getting excited about the conditions,&quot; gripes Andy Bradshaw, &quot;Sri Lanka have better seamers than us as well.&quot; England have an optimistic three slips in place, but they&apos;ve little to do as Dilshan leaves four deliveries alone, swishes at the fifth and then eases a single past gully from the sixth ball.  WICKET! Jayasuriya 0 c Prior b Onions (2nd over: Sri Lanka 7-1)  Onions opens at the other end. Dilshan swings and misses at the first delivery, then steals a single from the third. &quot;I think it&apos;s really public spirited of Straussy to have a bowl first&quot; says Ian Smithson, employing the merest hint of sarcasm, &quot;he must have been thinking of the fans who parted with their hard-earned to get in the gates. If we&apos;d have batted first we&apos;d be all out in 30 overs and they&apos;d Dilscoop them off in 10. This way we&apos;re guaranteed Sri Lanka&apos;s 50 plus at least 10 balls for our reply.&quot; Onions opens to Jayasuriya with five wides down the leg side. Oh. He&apos;s out. Caught behind. What a strange dismissal, a timid little stroke from Jayasuriya producing a simple catch off the outside edge. England hardly realised they&apos;d taken a wicket.  WICKET! Dilshan 2 c Morgan b Anderson (3rd over: Sri Lanka 7-2)  What a team England are! The greatest one-day side on earth! This must be the best XI they&apos;ve ever fielded. World beaters, the bunch of them. Dilshan smacks a catch straight to Eoin Morgan at point. Jayawardene flails helplessly at a brute of an opening delivery from Anderson.  4th over: Sri Lanka 13-2 (Sangakkara 1, Jayasuriya 5) &quot;Booth gone?&quot; scoffs Wayne Mark Stubbs (great handle, that), &quot;Don&apos;t worry. OBO commentators have more comebacks than Elvis on a bungee. Just wait until they need someone to do they need someone to do the Sunday morning shift covering a draw-bound test in a dead series.&quot; Sangakkara turns a single away through mid-wicket to move off zero, and as Onions&apos; line drifts down leg Jayawardene flicks four away fine.  WICKET! Jayawardene 7 lbw Anderson (5th over: Sri Lanka 17-3)  Jayawardene skips down the pitch to Anderson, and ends up looking a bit of a chump as the ball swings well away from him past off stump. His next shot is altogether more impressive though, as he cracks a straight drive back past the stumps for two runs down the ground. He&apos;s left groping at the next delivery, but, unflustered by that failure, he eases two runs out through cover from the next ball. That&apos;s a beautiful piece of batting in absurdly difficult conditions, and no sooner have I typed that than Jayawardene is out, trapped LBW by Anderson. That ball was fuller, and swung towards off and back into the pads as Jayawardene played across the line.  WICKET! Sangakkara 1 c Strauss b Onions (6th over: Sri Lanka 24-4)  Well I&apos;ll be damned. Sangakkara swings wildly at a wider ball and slices a catch straight to Strauss at slip. &quot;Goodness me, England. Well done, you,&quot; gasps Sarah Bacon, &quot;I wonder, though, whether the stress on the &apos;Englishness&apos; of the conditions isn&apos;t gilding the lily somewhat. Perhaps it&apos;s just that a sizeable percentage of the side are feeling very comfortable back home in, I mean, playing in Africa.&quot; Kandamby and Samaraweera scamper a pair of singles, and the over ends with a four through mid-wicket.  7th over: Sri Lanka 25-4 (Samaraweera 1, Kandamby 5)  Anderson slips a in-swinger in towards Samaraweera, and the ball skitters off the inside edge and past the stumps. &quot; Did you see Graeme Swann&apos;s joke competition on Twitter yesterday?&quot; asks Ed Genochio. No. No I didn&apos;t. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s helped restore the team&apos;s mojo. (The winning joke, incidentally: Why should you avoid Russian underpants?... Chernobyl fallout.)&quot; Mercy. I&apos;m being out-written by Graeme Swann.  8th over: Sri Lanka 31-4 (Samaraweera 5, Kandamby 7)  Samaraweera flicks three runs out to deep mid-wicket with an excess of panache. &quot;Very funny Bull&quot; grumbles David Hopkins, &quot;Now can you run us through what has ACTUALLY happened in the first six overs. 42 without loss is it?&quot; Honestly I&apos;m stupefied by this myself.  9th over: Sri Lanka 34-4 (Samaraweera 7, Kandamby 8)  Anderson&apos;s figures so far are 4-1-6-2, while Onions&apos; are 4-0-25-2. Time to bring Stuart Broad into the attack perhaps? &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; shouts Cory Hazlehurst, &quot;It sounds from your report that wild slashes from Sri Lankans are going straight to fielders, maybe England are going to use up their entire luck quota in this match. Before we know it they&apos;ll have run out someone by hitting the stumps from a direct hit. Then I&apos;ll know you&apos;re just making this all up, and Sri Lanka are actually 345-0 from eleven overs.&quot; Broad is doing some very vigorous warm-ups now, so I imagine he&apos;ll be on soon enough, especially as this over was Anderson&apos;s least threatening yet.  10th over: Sri Lanka 43-4 (Samaraweera 15, Kandamby 8)  Here is Stuart Broad, and there goes Stuart Broad, as Samaraweera thumps four down through long-off in emphatic fashion. Ouch, the next shot is even better, Samaraweera leans back and cuts four more viciously past point. A glorious pair of shots, those. &quot;So maybe the ECB scheduling those seven interminable ODIs against Australia wasn&apos;t so daft after all,&quot; muses Robin Hazlehurst as Samaraweera opts to block the next two deliveries, &quot;The sense of release now that it is all over has put a spring in England&apos;s step and they can get back to enjoying their cricket - which they apparently are today. Brilliant psychological planning.&quot;  11th over: Sri Lanka 43-4 (Samaraweera 15, Kandamby 8)  &quot;Re: the winning joke in over 7: Chernobyl, as any fule know, is in Ukraine not Russia&quot; seethes Peter Withey, &quot;Shame on Swann for allowing this geographical blunder.&quot; Now he&apos;s got his funk going, it&apos;d be a shame to cut him off, so here&apos;s the rest of his email: &quot;What&apos;s with cricketers using Twitter anyway? Surely it&apos;s for people with some ability to entertain using the English (or indeed any other) language? Swann is fabulously entertaining but only whilst holding bat or ball. What&apos;s he got to say that&apos;s so bloody interesting? Nothing, same as pretty much all sportspeople. Witness that great contradiction in terms Sports &quot;Personality&quot; of the Year for further evidence of why we admire them for their physical and athletic prowess, not their witty banter. Sportspeople and Twitter: about as entertaining a combination as Stephen Fry and pole vaulting. All right the latter is entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons.&quot;  12th over: Sri Lanka 46-4 (Samaraweera 17, Kandamby 9) &quot;In the old days if I googled my name, I was on the first page of results due to my emails from the 2005 ashes&quot; mourns Jim Carpenter, perhaps revealing just a little more about the sorry state of his social life than he had intended, &quot;Now I&apos;m not even in the first ten pages, it&apos;s all facebook-this and myspace-that.&quot; Good grief, it gets worse. &quot;There&apos;s also a troubling German school question about who my murderer is, but we&apos;ll gloss over that. I&apos;d boasted of my over-by-over fame, but other than Naylor the ubiquitous we glorious few from 2005 seem to have gone the way of the dodo. Any other survivors out there?&quot; No. No you&apos;re one of the final few 2005 originals still going Jim. The rest of them are all propping up bars around the world, nursing watered-down booze complaining about how they couldda been contenders. &quot;I used to be in the OBO game&quot; they mutter, &quot;tough racket.&quot; Then they go home and google their own names, and count the number of pages they have to go through before they find a mention of themselves. What was I talking about again?  13th over: Sri Lanka 48-4 (Samaraweera 17, Kandamby 10) Two runs from this over, one of them a leg bye.  14th over: Sri Lanka 52-4 (Samaraweera 17, Kandamby 11) &quot;Graeme Swann not entertaining?&quot; gasps a dumbfounded Erik Petersen, &quot;Pah. For work, I was once at a primary school in Nottingham where Swanny was making an appearance for one of those desperate &quot;Please kids, put down the football and play the occasional game of cricket&quot; days. He was going around the room chatting to the kiddies, asking them if they played cricket, and one said he sometimes went to watch his dad play at a local club. Graeme knew the local club, and then spent the next five minutes rhapsodising on what a great pub it had next door. He highly recommended it. To a classroom of nine-year-olds. Comedy gold.&quot; The score tick-tocks on past fifty, pushed onwards by a pair of wides from Broad.  15th over: Sri Lanka 60-4 (Samaraweera 19, Kandamby 16) &quot;Dear dear,&quot; rebuts Ed Genochio, &quot;tell me exactly how pole-vaulting is better than reading Swann&apos;s latest tweet: &apos;After the joke bonanza yesterday i dreamt i was doing stand up at the apollo, went down an absolute treat...but then i was playing chess against the ginger one from girls aloud all dressed up in a gimp suit. please help me...&apos; Peter Withey may have something better to do with his time. I don&apos;t.&quot; Onions is back, and begins by whanging down a pair of short balls, the second of which whacks Samaraweera on the hand and leaves him reeling away in pain. Unfortunately though a single follows and Onions then follows up with a short, wide delivery which Kandamby cracks past cover for four.  16th over: Sri Lanka 62-4 (Samaraweera 20, Kandamby 16) These two have put on 43 together now. And already all that optimism is evaporating away like so much spilt milk in the sun. &quot;So, how can England mess this one up?&quot; asks Charles Downes as Broad gives up another wide, &quot;I foresee a middle order collapse and England bemoaning the state of the wicket / weather / light. Pessimistic me? No just an England fan.&quot;  17th over: Sri Lanka 63-4 (Samaraweera 20, Kandamby 16) &quot;Jim Carpenter is luckier than he thinks. I had at least three emails published on OBO during the 2005 Ashes&quot; recalls Ben Mimmack wistfully, &quot;but when I looked at the benighted book, they&apos;d all been excised. I felt like Trotsky after the revolution.&quot; One day soon you&apos;ll wake up with an ice pick in the back of your head.  18th over: Sri Lanka 63-4 (Samaraweera 21, Kandamby 16) &quot;Surely the question is not whether sports people are funny on Twitter, but whether anyone is funny on Twitter?&quot; asks Gary Naylor, &quot;These obsessives who punch their keyboards compulsively day after day, with the sole intention of being read by people who don&apos;t want to read their dull words, really get my goat. Er\u2026&quot; I think that email deserves to stand alone in a paragraph all of its own. But then Samaraweera snicks the ball off his inside edge flush into his box, then doubles over in pain. And a man being hit in the groin by a ball, as any fule kno, merits an obligatory mention in any cricket commentary worth its salt.  19th over: Sri Lanka 74-4 (Samaraweera 29, Kandamby 17) Samaraweera gracefully turns four runs through mid-wicket, then punches four more down the ground through long-on. Onions replies with a brainless bouncer that sails down the leg side for a wide. &quot;Jim Carpenter&apos;s reminded me of a date I went on with somebody I met through Soulmates,&quot; says Chris Gripton, &quot;Keen to impress the young lady with my Guardian reading credentials I boasted about the fact that I&apos;d been published on The Guardian website, not quite confessing to the fact it was in fact restricted to two OBO contributions from 2004 and &apos;05&quot; - Chris has included the links to these memorable occasions, but I&apos;m really not sure they&apos;re necessary, unless you people are really, really bored - &quot;I was somewhat caught out when the lady in question revealed that she too had had some work published in The Guardian on the subject of the the effects on adoptive parents of reuniting adopted children with their natural parents which kind of showed me up for the work-shy cricket obsessed saddo I probably am. Surprisingly we&apos;re still together.&quot; Pity relationship is it?  WICKET! Samaraweera 30 c Collingwood b Broad (20th over: Sri Lanka 81-5)  Bob Willis unleashes a tirade of condemnation on England&apos;s witless bowling after Broad flings down another bouncer and watches the ball sail away for four over Prior&apos;s head. Sod&apos;s law means that Willis&apos; words are more than enough to prompt another wicket to fall. Samaraweera is caught at backward point off the outside edge. &quot;The best thing about Swann&apos;s chess tweet was Jimmy Anderson&apos;s next tweet&quot; Andy Bradshaw tells us, &quot;I&apos;ve just seen Swann in the lobby playing chess and absentmindedly ruffling Colly&apos;s hair.&quot;  21st over: Sri Lanka 89-5 (Kandamby 24, Mathews 4) The Least Reassuring Phrases in the History of Cricket, part XVII of an ongoing series: &apos;Luke Wright is coming into the attack&apos;. Mathews duly clumps the third ball back past Wright&apos;s ankles and away for four down the ground. A humiliatingly wide wide sails past off stump, and the over ends with a flick to third man for two more.  22nd over: Sri Lanka 95-5 (Kandamby 25, Mathews 10) &quot;I was curious to learn more about this mythical lord of the OBO, Gary Naylor&quot; writes Tom Cochrane, &quot;So I googled him. The top hit, his most notable quote, you ask? Surely a pithy, informed and witty comment on some England batting collapse? No, it&apos;s this: &apos;Figure the average weight of your cows, and you can estimate how much hay you will need per cow.&apos; Is there no subject on which the man cannot enlighten us?&quot; And that&apos;s the shot of the day, Mathews standing tall and whipping four through deep backward square with a delightful hook shot. Broad follows up with a wide. &quot;This bowling performance should be X-rated&quot; says Willis. That&apos;s the 16th wide of the innings.  23rd over: Sri Lanka 100-5 (Kandamby 27, Mathews 13) Collingwood hits the stumps with a throw from backward point, but the batsman is safe and the ball ricochets away for two overthrows, raising the Sri Lankan hundred.  24th over: Sri Lanka 102-5 (Kandamby 28, Mathews 13) And here&apos;s Paul Collingwood. England need one more wicket to get an opening at Sr Lanka&apos;s very long tail, which features Muttiah Muralitharan no less at a heady no9 in the order. Collingwood though is intent only on containment, and gives up a mere two runs, one of them a wide, in his maiden over.  25th over: Sri Lanka 108-5 (Kandamby 33, Mathews 15) Kandamby hits a drive so plumb-straight that it crashes into the non-striker&apos;s stumps, and so powerful that it then runs away to the boundary for four regardless. &quot;Sorry to be a pedant,&quot; says Phil Powell with the air of a man who is in no way sorry to be a pedant, &quot;but the header for this OBO is nothing short of atrocious. Can things really have slipped so far so quickly since Booth&apos;s departure?&quot; You&apos;ve no idea...  26th over: Sri Lanka 116-5 (Kandamby 37, Mathews 17) &quot;Can I put in an entry for the Least Reassuring Phrases in the History of Cricket series?&quot; asks Alan White: &quot;The field is spread and there are plenty of singles on offer as Shah takes guard&quot;. The 18th wide of the innings fades past the off stump. Mathews and Kandamby sneak and scamper some singles, accruing seven from the over.  27th over: Sri Lanka 123-5 (Kandamby 42, Mathews 18) And here&apos;s Graeme Swann, on at the golf course end. His first ball spins, but not enough to trouble Mathews, who flicks it away for a single. Kandamby guides his nect delivery away for four to third man, and Swann then serves up a seemingly-obligatory wide. &quot;As I write, England have reduced Sri Lanka to 100-odd for 5,&quot; points out Nic Stone, helpfully, &quot;The thing about being an England fan is that if this were England batting, you&apos;d expect them to fold for maybe 150-160. Put Sri Lanka in the same position and a true England fan just knows they will still reach 250, even though conditions favour the bowlers, and England will still be bowled out for 160 in reply. I&apos;ve just explained this to my newborn son and he turned his back on me. He already has the haggard look of an England cricket follower about him and he&apos;s only 15 days old.&quot;  28th over: Sri Lanka 125-5 (Kandamby 43, Mathews 19) Paul Collingwood bowlsBatsmen leave the ball aloneI stifle my yawn So I picked up a bad haiku habit in Japan. Sorry about that. I&apos;m working on it.  29th over: Sri Lanka 131-5 (Kandamby 47, Mathews 21) &quot;My first OBO comment lightheartedly asked the readers for advice on clearing an about:blank virus from my then girlfriends dad&apos;s computer&quot; remembers Tom v d Gucht fondly, &quot;I was horrified when it was printed as it left me in a catch22 position of either publicly shaming the dad as a porn user or trying to save his reputation by falling on my sword and taking the blame.&quot;  30th over: Sri Lanka 133-5 (Kandamby 47, Mathews 21) I don&apos;t know what Sky are doing, but they seem to have cut away from the live cricket to show us Bob Willis in a studio presenting a feature called &apos;Inside Edge&apos;. I suppose you have to do something to fill these middle overs. On that topic, Mike Atherton wrote a superb, and entirely original, piece this week about how to fix the one-day game, I just hope that for once the people who run the game are listening to the man.  31st over: Sri Lanka 139-5 (Kandamby 49, Mathews 27) Gracious, what a shot that is. Mathews drops to one knee and carves a sweep away past backward square for four. I&apos;d be amazed if England mustered a single shot with half as much panache about it in the entirety of their innings.  Terrible poem Really nothing else to say A load of old bull Thanks for that, Michael Sones.  32nd over: Sri Lanka 141-5 (Kandamby 50, Mathews 27) Kandamby raises his fifty with a dainty glance to leg. &quot;Least Reassuring Phrases?&quot; ponders Mark Lloyd, &quot;I vividly remember the sense of despair and pointlessness which came over me whilst listening to the commentary on an Ashes test being played in Australia a few years back, with England already 2 or 3-nil down and the Waugh twins piling on the runs, when I heard the immortal lines: &apos;This one finds the gap, Tufnell&apos;s after it.&apos;&quot;  33rd over: Sri Lanka 148-5 (Kandamby 51, Mathews 34) Luke Wright accidentally palms four runs over the rope diving to to try and cut off a glance to third man from Mathews.  34th over: Sri Lanka 149-5 (Kandamby 51, Mathews 34) Collingwood spits a delivery past a defensive prod from Mathews, and the ball pings Prior on his fingertip. He staggers away from the wicket, grunting in pain. He&apos;s bowling well now Collingwood, keeping the ball up around off stump and letting it wobble around the outside edge.  35th over: Sri Lanka 157-5 (Kandamby 51, Mathews 43) Onions is back into the attack now England have a new ball to work with. &quot;Nice to see some aspiring youngsters in the crowd&quot; writes Sunil, before adding &quot;So that&apos;s what England&apos;s future players look like.&quot; Mathews chips four runs up and over mid-wicket, an audacious shot oddly rewarded with a burst of Depeche Mode over the PA system.  36th over: Sri Lanka 160-5 (Kandamby 52, Mathews 45) &quot;Oh, how to fix the one-day game, not how to fix a one-day game. Miss-read that&quot; says Damien Sefton of my link to the Times. Right, yes, I was trying to praise the man, not slander him. I should probably make that clear.  37th over: Sri Lanka 161-5 (Kandamby 52, Mathews 45) Onions appeals for a catch behind off Kandamby&apos;s inside edge, but Billy Bowden shakes his head, unconvinced. Onions pushes his next delivery out wider and tempts Mathews into a wild heave. Fortunately for him, he fails to make any contact. He pats a yorker out to leg to end the over.  WICKET! Kandamby 53 run out Wright (38th over: Sri Lanka 163-6)  Well that was foolish. Kandamby is run out after a curiously idiotic piece of running, he was trying to take a quick single to cover and the run was definitely on but for some reason Mathews just didn&apos;t want to run for it. He rather hung his partner out to dry there.  39th over: Sri Lanka 166-6 (Mathews 48, Kulasekera 0)  Mathews drives neatly through extra cover for two runs. Peter Davies has surpassed himself here:  Andy Bull&apos;s haiku,For the Champions TrophyA champion strophe Don&apos;t be ashamed if you have to google &apos;strophe&apos;, readers, you&apos;ll be in good company. &quot;England have got Luke Wright on for some reason&quot; comments a baffled Sanjay Manjrekar.  40th over: Sri Lanka 170-6 (Mathews 51, Kulasekera 1)  &quot;You describe Michael Atherton&apos;s article on how to fix the 50-over game as &apos;superb&apos;&quot; grumbles Ben Howell, &quot;I can only see two proposals: allow captains to put fielders where they want for the first 40 overs, and allow bowlers as many overs as they like. Really? So Murali and Mendis bowling 25 overs each to a defensive field is the blueprint for a revival in 50-over cricket? Can&apos;t see it myself \u2013 but then it&apos;s Friday, I&apos;m tired, ale is calling and I may have missed something crucial. If so, I&apos;ll happily shut up.&quot; Amen to your last sentence Ben. Maybe superb was over-doing it, but broadening Atherton&apos;s point out from those two specifics his point is that all the attempts to improve one-day cricket have made it more formulaic by limiting the decision-making of the players. To make the game more spontaneous and varied the Laws should be taken in the opposite direction: scrap all fielding and bowling restrictions, junk the powerplays. Just allow fifty overs a side and leave the rest to the players... it is, at any rate, an original argument. WICKET! Or is it? The Sri Lankans are protesting that they&apos;ve been obstructed by the field here. Mathews has been run out, but only after he had collided with Onions as he turned back for a second run. The umpires confer, and Mathews walks. But no! He&apos;s been called back onto the field. Mathews innings continues. Strauss has called the batsman back, mindful of the fallout from what happened against New Zealand last year perhaps, when Collingwood upheld the dismissal of Grant Elliot. Onions was not in the wrong there, so Strauss may have been a little over-generous. Good sportsmanship? Or naive captaincy?  WICKET! Mathews c Prior b Wright (41st over: Sri Lanka 180-7)  Mathews wallops four over Strauss&apos; head at slip with a terrific flourish. That&apos;s all she wrote though, as Mathews snicks the next ball behind towards Prior, who takes a good low catch. Here&apos;s Muttiah Muralitharan then, slapping the first ball of the over out towards the rope at mid-wicket for two runs.  42nd over: Sri Lanka 191-7 (Kulasekara 7, Muralitharan 14)  Sri Lanka take their powerplay. And there&apos;s the reason why: Murali swats his second ball for six back over Stuart Broad&apos;s head. That&apos;s a ridiculous shot. In fact it almost defies my vocabulary. Sky are showing the replays of that run out, Strauss definitely recalled the batsman, to the obvious disgust and disbelief of his players, visible in the picture over his shoulder. When Mathews was out again moments later he had the good grace to say thanks to England for recalling him. Murali smears four more to fine leg with another cross-batted swipe.  43rd over: Sri Lanka 196-7 (Kulasekara 7, Muralitharan 17)  Dropped! Murali lofts another ludicrous shot out to leg, and Strauss tracks back looking over his shoulder at deep backward square. He takes the catch, and the ball then tumbles out of his grasp and falls to earth. &quot;You say po-tay-to I say po-tah-to&quot; says Grant Cartledge of that piece by Atherton, &quot;You say &apos;original argument&apos;, I say &apos;Bairstow on the boundary&apos;.&quot; Yes, Mike Brearley really did put his wicketkeeper field at long stop. In fairness Atheron does say that he would keep restrictions in for the last ten overs, making that situation a little less likely to occur.  WICKET! Muralitharan 18 b Broad (44th over: Sri Lanka 198-8) Broad clean bowls Murali with a straight delivery that hits the top of off as Murali allows himself another wild slash. WICKET! Malinga 0 b Broad (Sri Lanka 197-9) He then repeats the delivery and removes Lasith Malinga for a golden duck, putting him on a hat trick. Mendis just manages to play away the hat-trick delivery, throwing his bat out before him like a man trying to deter a raging bull by tossing a towel over its horns and hoping for the best.  45th over: Sri Lanka 200-9 (Kulasekara 9, Mendis 0) &quot;Good sportsmanship from Strauss&quot; says Steve Anthony, &quot;the respect he&apos;ll get for recalling the batsman far outweighs the criticism he&apos;d get for not doing so. Mature and far-sighted captaincy, not naive at all.&quot; I agree, though it&apos;s a lot easier to take that view when the reprieved batsmen gets out two balls later. Sri Lanka creep up to 200 as the final pair swap singles.  46th over: Sri Lanka 208-9 (Kulasekara 16, Mendis 3) Mercy. Broad drops short and wide, and Kulasekara leans back and cracks away an almighty cut shot, played with both feet off the ground, the ball flying up and over the boundary rope at backward point for six. England, by the way, are five overs behind the over rate.  47th over: Sri Lanka 211-9 (Kulasekara 17, Mendis 5) Anderson comes off, and Luke Wright comes on. No, no I don&apos;t know either. He clangs Mendis on the glove with a heavy bouncer. Three irritating singles ensue. Paul Collingwood almost takes a superb diving catch at point from the final ball, but he&apos;s not sure himself whether it carried. He stands there, arm aloft, an uncertain look on his face. The umpires confer and then send it up for TV replays, which prove predictably inconclusive. The third umpire settles on &apos;not out&apos; because he can&apos;t really tell either way.  WICKET! Mendis 5 c Strauss b Anderson (48th over: Sri Lanka 212) (Kulasekara 17) Anderson gives up a wide with a bouncer. And then, at last, England take the final wicket, as Mendis edges a catch through to Strauss, who topples over low to his left to take it. That&apos;s quite a comeback from Sri Lanka, given that they were 17-4.  So England need 213 for an unlikely win, which, against Murali and Mendis under lights, will be far from as easy as it looks. I&apos;ll be back in 30 minutes or so to tell you how it all unfolds, see you then.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: England 2-0 (Strauss 1, Denly 0) need 213 Here we go then. You don&apos;t need to have Rasputin-like powers to predict that England are going to be content to crawl along at 3.5 runs an over for most of their innings, slipping slowly behind the run rate, most likely they&apos;ll continue like that until the pressure gets to be too great and they collapse in a heap ending up 36 runs shy of the target. Malinga opens the attack. Strauss nudges his second delivery away for a single towards mid-wicket. Denly gropes around, playing across his pad. A no ball gives him a free hit and... Denly can&apos;t even get his bat on the ball, which was slow and straight.  2nd over: England 2-0 (Strauss 1, Denly 0) need 213 It&apos;s a curious truth that free hits hardly ever seem to go to the boundary. Anyway, here&apos;s Nuwan Kulasekara, currently the world&apos;s no1 ranked ODI bowler. The first four balls land on off stump and jag past Strauss&apos;s ponderous defensive strokes. The fifth prompts an appeal for caught behind, and for a moment Sky second-guess the umpire and make England&apos;s score 2-1. Bowden is not so quick to judge, and after a long pause he shakes his head and Strauss is reprieved.  3rd over: England 5-0 (Strauss 3, Denly 1) need 213 Denly hustles a single. Strauss then squirts a fortuitous edge away past gully to long leg and England take two runs. Malinga&apos;s next delivery cuts him in two, cutting back off the pitch between bat and pad, leaving Strauss sucking his teeth.  WICKET! Denly 5 LBW Kulasekara (4th over: England 9-1) need 213 Denly plays a fine Chinese cut away for four to fine leg. If only he&apos;d meant it. And he&apos;s out next ball, drawing wild whoops of jubilation from the Lankan fielders. Owais Shah is in then, and so, it seems, is the rot.  5th over: England 15-1 (Strauss 8, Shah 1) need 213 &quot;Well what did Denly do wrong here?&quot; intones Bob Willis as Sky show the replay of the wicket, &quot;well not much, apart from missing the ball with his bat.&quot; Quite. Strauss pulls a short ball away for one to leg. &quot;This is the England one-day side I remember&quot; says Sara Torvalds, &quot;after a recognizable first three overs: the run rate is approaching the negative and I safely predict game will be lost in the first fifteen overs. Obviously, the first overs of Sri Lanka&apos;s innings was a momentary aberration.&quot; Shah blocks out a yorker away to leg, and Strauss then cracks a deliciously crisp cut to backward point, where Dilshan makes a good stop. Strauss drops his bat on yet another yorker at the end of the over, the ball running away for four to fine leg.  6th over: England 19-1 (Strauss 8, Shah 1) need 213 Shah hustles two leg byes - punctuated by a single from Strauss - and Kulasekara then gives up a wide.  7th over: England 19-1 (Strauss 8, Shah 1) need 213 Mathews is into the attack now, plying his wobbly medium-fast. Rather unbelievably, Shah leaves each of Mathews&apos; six innocuous deliveries well alone, playing a series of exaggeratedly emphatic leaves.  WICKET! Strauss 9 c Kandamby b Kulasekara (8th over: England 19-2) need 213 Wow. What a catch that is by Kandamby at mid-wicket. Strauss fairly clobbered a fierce pull shot out to leg, but Kandamby leapt and plucked it from the air as it whistled overhead. Collingwood is in and hopping about, trying to scratch out his first run. He pats the first ball out to leg and for some inexplicable reason at the non-striker&apos;s end Owais Shah gets his feet into a tangle and falls over face-first onto the wicket. At least he wasn&apos;t on strike at the time I suppose, the hapless ninny.  9th over: England 22-2 (Shah 1, Collingwood 0) need 213 Mathews beats Collingwood&apos;s outside edge with an away-swinger. &quot;Not only is there no TMS on BBC radio,&quot; gripes Gary Naylor, &quot;but I&apos;ve just listened to about 45 minutes of the usual inanities on FiveLive without a single update on the match - as if it wasn&apos;t happening. The BBC really, really hate cricket don&apos;t they?&quot; Depends entirely on whether they&apos;ve got the rights to broadcast it or not, unfortunately. And I&apos;m sure they had to devote a good 25 minutes to some big piece of news like, ohh I don&apos;t know, Marlon Harewood moving to Newcastle or somesuch bunkum.  10th over: England 36-2 (Shah 1, Collingwood 15) need 213 Well I never, what a shot. Collingwood shows some chutzpah by stepping down the pitch and lofting Kulasekara&apos;s latest delivery up and over mid-wicket for six. He glances the next ball fine to leg for four and all of a sudden, for the first time in a long time, England look like they have a decent one-day batsman in their ranks again. He steps out again and cocks his leg as he carts four more away through backward square. That&apos;s 14 from three deliveries.  11th over: England 46-2 (Shah 2, Collingwood 23) need 213 Shah wisely takes a single from the first ball, realising that, almost uniquely in their recent history, England have an in-form batsman at one end. Collingwood duly leans on a cover drive, and the ball hurtles across the turf through cover for four. He stands tall and clips the fifth delivery wide of mid-on for four more. T6he man&apos;s on fire! He&apos;s hit 22 from his last eight balls. He sprints a single from the sixth delivery to ensure he holds onto the strike. I honestly can&apos;t recall the last time I saw an English batsman play with such assurance in a one-day game.  12th over: England 47-2 (Shah 2, Collingwood 23) need 213 The first key bowling change: Sangakkara brings Ajantha Mendis into the attack. England have never faced him before outside of a net. Frankly, anyone who has watched them much at all over the last few years won&apos;t be fancying their chances much against the mystery spinner. Collingwood gropes at him a drunken salaryman on a packed Tokyo commuter train, before taking a single to leg allowing Shah a chance to prod forward, bat in front of pad.  13th over: England 47-2 (Shah 2, Collingwood 23) need 213 &quot;Come on Andy&quot; exhorts Gary Naylor while Collingwood plays out a maiden, &quot;you know that the BBC could acquire rights if they were prepared to pay for them. That&apos;s a commercial decision and they have chosen not to do so, as well as choosing to cover England&apos;s forthcoming tour to South Africa on the cheap. Whilst it suits the BBC to appear impecunious, it is a vast organisation with cashflow security like no other enterprise on the planet - despite that, it never quite has enough money, time, bandwidth whatever for doing cricket properly. You&apos;ll be sure to press the red button to see an interview with a Force India wheel-changer won&apos;t you, as one BBC talking head hands over to another at the other end of the Singapore pits?&quot; More importantly Gary, when are they going to give you your own talk radio show?  14th over: England 52-2 (Shah 7, Collingwood 25) need 213 Shah takes a huge backlift and then clumps four up and over mid-off off Mendis&apos; first ball. Otherwise he is playing the spinner with his bat well out in front of his pad, a series of good-looking solid defensive strokes.  15th over: England 55-2 (Shah 9, Collingwood 26) need 213 Mathews is still plugging away, pegging back England&apos;s run rate after that aggressive flurry from Collingwood a few moments back. England muster three singles from his latest over.  16th over: England 56-2 (Shah 10, Collingwood 26) need 213 Shah slaps a chip back over mid-on off Mendis&apos; first ball. Seems his plan is to try and take a boundary from him early in the over and then settle into a string of forward defensive strokes for the remainder. His single here puts Collingwood on strike though, and he seems altogether less certain of his technique against the spinner.  17th over: England 63-2 (Shah 12, Collingwood 31) need 213 Mathews continues, his spell stretching into a sixth straight over. Maybe he is just beginning to flag: Collingwood snicks four fortuitous runs to fine leg off the inside edge, and then, as Mathews&apos; line creeps too wide, he adds a sharp single. Shah squeezes another to short fine leg.  18th over: England 71-2 (Shah 12, Collingwood 38) need 213 Malinga is back into the attack - I wonder why Sangakkara is keeping Murali waiting so long? Shah stares back down the track with that freakish wide-eyed intensity, manically chewing gum as he waits for the first ball. That runs away for a leg bye, and Collingwood then comes on strike. He is almost diddled out of his wicket by a slower ball that ricochets off the leading edge towards, but just short, of mid-off. Cripes. That&apos;s another six from Collingwood, who picks up a short ball from Malinga and deposits it over square leg with a terrific crack.  19th over: England 73-2 (Shah 12, Collingwood 39) need 213 &quot;I&apos;m disappointed that no-one has come up with the obvious solution for learning to bat against Mendis&quot; says Paul Headon, &quot;when you&apos;ve never faced him before. When Fernando Alonso turned up at a grand prix track he&apos;d never driven on before, he announced that it wouldn&apos;t be a problem, because he&apos;d studied it on the xbox. Where is that initiative, that nous, from England&apos;s batsmen? I want to see Andy Flower up there in front of the press, announcing that &apos;we&apos;re going to score bucketfuls of runs off him, because Colly&apos;s been plugging away on Brian Lara Cricket, and can score 20 an over against him, no problem&apos;.&quot;  WICKET! Collingwood 46 b Malinga (20th over: England 82-3) need 213 I don&apos;t know what Collingwood has had for breakfast today, but being dropped from the England team seems to have done him the power of good: that&apos;s his third six of the innings. Again it&apos;s lofted up and over backward square leg, and again it doesn&apos;t just clear the rope but sails well over it and deep into the crowd. And then, sadly, he&apos;s out. He&apos;s played on to his own stumps. How disappointing. That was the most assertive innings he has played in a long while, and he&apos;s furious that it is over, kicking at the pitch in frustration. Morgan is welcomed to the wicket with a yorker from Malinga, which he digs out easily enough.  21st over: England 82-3 (Shah 13, Morgan 0) need 213 Sangakkara roars out an appeal for a catch behind off the outside edge, but umpire Dar merely raises a disapproving eyebrow and looks in the other direction. The question is whether now England have lost a wicket, they&apos;re going to collapse into a heap despite having built a near-match-winning platform. &quot;The BBC may have chosen not to bid for any televised cricket rights, but you&apos;ve got to respect their track record on deciding what sport to spend our licence fee on,&quot; says Michael Foreman, &quot;It&apos;s not like they&apos;d spunk \u00a31 million of our money on Audley Harrison&apos;s first 10 professional fights or anything.&quot; Do you want to add the &apos;eh? Oh&apos; yourself Michael, or shall I do it for you?  22nd over: England 87-3 (Shah 16, Morgan 2) need 213 Still no sign of Muralitharan, though you&apos;d think he&apos;d be just the man to prise open the middle-order now there&apos;s a new batsman in. Shah and Morgan swap singles. &quot;&apos;Cripes. That&apos;s another six from Collingwood, who picks up a short ball from Malinga and deposits it over square leg with a terrific crack&apos;&quot; quotes Sam Jordison back at me, before asking &quot;Did you go on holiday to the 1950s?&quot; Truth be told my mind is starting to drift away. It&apos;s the jet lag you see. Far as my body is concerned it is 3.30am in the morning. Either that or it&apos;s just the bog standard brain-rot that affects all sports journalists if they stay in the business too long. Anyway, Sam adds as a sign-off: &quot;PS That&apos;s not a criticism, I&apos;m enjoying the commentary and the retro-flourishes make it all the more jolly. Let&apos;s hope our chaps biff some more of those sixes!&quot;  23rd over: England 93-3 (Shah 17, Morgan 6) need 213 And here is Muralitharan at last. That familiar cheeky grin spread across his face as he plots and schemes over his next wicket. I hope that when Murali retires next year he gets his due from the Western press. In comparison to the praise they lavish on Warne, he deserves more plaudits than he gets. He has, after all, every bit as strong a claim to being the greatest spin bowler to play the game. Anyway, Morgan and Shah take singles to and fro, and there&apos;s a wide as well, so it&apos;s six from Murali&apos;s first over.  24th over: England 101-3 (Shah 17, Morgan 14) need 213 And at the other end comes Ajantha Mendis. Morgan premeditates a paddle-sweep, and succeeds in edging the ball up and over Sangakkara&apos;s head and away for four. He clumps a drive away to deep cover, where Laith Malinga makes a terrible hash of fielding the ball and gifts the batsman another boundary.  25th over: England 106-3 (Shah 18, Morgan 18) need 213 Morgan snicks four runs off his outside edge and away through third man as he drives towards cover. He&apos;s now drawn level with Shah, despite facing only 16 balls as opposed to the Shah&apos;s 44. &quot;Paul Headon (19th over) may be on to something,&quot; says Phil Sawyer, &quot;but I fear that Shah has been taking lessons from Piquet Jr rather than Alonso. How else to explain his consistent efforts to run himself out and get the safety car that is England&apos;s middle order in. Someone should explain to him that slowing things down to a crawl for a few laps may lead to a surprise win in F1, but slowing England&apos;s run rate down in an ODI has exactly the opposite effect - an insipid loss that absolutely no-one is surprised by.&quot; Mmmhmm. Shah&apos;s strike rate is a turgid 40 at the moment.  26th over: England 108-3 (Shah 18, Morgan 20) need 213 Morgan sets himself for another paddle sweep, and this time he gets the ball away around the corner for a single. Without wishing to curse the man, he&apos;s playing well, making the most of the luck he has had.  27th over: England 116-3 (Shah 20, Morgan 26) need 213 Another streaky shot from Morgan, who strides out to try and force Murali through the off and instead snicks four runs fine past Sangakkara&apos;s grasping gloves.  28th over: England 118-3 (Shah 21, Morgan 27) need 213 The innings meanders on, as Mendis ties up the English batsmen. They&apos;re complicit in it of course, content as they are to ease their way along in singles.  29th over: England 121-3 (Shah 22, Morgan 28) need 213 Three more singles for England. &quot;Totally agree with the sentiments expressed about the Beeb&apos;s dislike of cricket,&quot; opines Martin Duckworth, &quot;I suspect it&apos;s because those in charge at Auntie grew up in the days when BBC&apos;s cricket coverage occupied the entire schedule rain or shine and were consequently bored to tears. Personally, I long for the days of Benaud and Jim Laker, with dear old Peter West saying stuff like, &apos;Well as there doesn&apos;t seem to be much likelihood of play at The Oval for some time, what we&apos;re going to do is take you back to 1976 when these two sides played a great match here. We join the action with the West Indies on five without loss with Bob Willis bowling to Gordon Greenidge.&apos; Ah, bliss.&quot; Quite.  30th over: England 130-3 (Shah 29, Morgan 31) need 213 Kulasekara is back into the attack now, as Sangakkara goes searching for that elusive wicket. Shah sloppily pulls a single out to mid-wicket. He&apos;s scoring so slowly that I almost expect to see his score start rolling back towards zero. Well maybe he heard that out in the middle - he&apos;s flicked the fourth six of the innings up and over leg from the very next ball. He made that look very easy indeed, just cocking his wrists as he pulled the ball, angling its trajectory up and over the infield.  31st over: England 136-3 (Shah 31, Morgan 34) need 213 Y&quot;ou&apos;re absolutely spot on about Murali,&quot; writes Phil Sawyer most agreeably, &quot;His achievements should be celebrated. The secret of his success is not the congenital defect in his arm - if anything, the constant questioning of his action would have destroyed someone less able to cope with the constant pressure and accusations - rather it is in his extremely flexible wrist and marvellous control of the ball. Criticising him for this would be like saying that it&apos;s unfair that Usain Bolt has very fast legs.&quot; Murali&apos;s not having the best match tionight though, he&apos;s on again now, giving up a string of singles - four in a row in fact -and then a wide as well.  32nd over: England 138-3 (Shah 31, Morgan 34) need 213 Kulasekara switches around the wicket, and has Morgan limply prodding at a slower ball. Morgan steers a run away to fine leg, and Shah then threads another through cover.  33rd over: England 146-3 (Shah 37, Morgan 35) need 213 Guru Singh needs your help. He&apos;s cycling from Oxford to Cambridge to raise money for the British Heart Foundation. He&apos;s sent me five emails in this innings alone asking for a plug so I figure it&apos;s probably time to give him one. If you&apos;d like to sponsor him click here. Shah whacks four more through extra cover and, dare I say it, it&apos;s all beginning to look a little easy. Surely England can&apos;t lose this now.  34th over: England 151-3 (Shah 39, Morgan 37) need 213 &quot;It&apos;s happening again&quot; wails John Richards, &quot;I&apos;m getting lulled into believing England can do this. It doesn&apos;t matter how often the inevitable happens, I still fall for it. Oddly, my lullability increases with each beer. Should I stop drinking... or keep going? It&apos;s a dilemma.&quot; That&apos;s no kind of dilemma from where I&apos;m sitting, but then I&apos;m a very thirsty man. The 150 comes up with a wide from Kulasekara. Morgan then squirts a run out to mid-on.  WICKET! Shah 44 c Sangakkara b Muralitharan (35th over: England 158-4) need 213 Presumably it&apos;s too little coming along too late but that&apos;s a lovely piece of bowling by Murali, baffling Shah with a doosra that pitches on leg and then turns to beats the bat. Sangakkara gathers the catch and scoops off the bails for good measure.  36th over: England 159-4 (Morgan 40, Prior 0) need 213 And immediately Sangakkara brings Mendis back into the attack. He&apos;s not given up on his hopes of a dramatic English collapse yet. And a googly draws a huge LBW appeal from Mendis as Prior fails to pick it and is rapped on the pad. He survives, just. Sally Ledger sent me this one just a few moments ago: &quot;Whoever it is commentating on Sky (apologies for my ignorance) has just said that England have got to do something pretty stupid to lose this now. Have they not watched England in one day cricket before? And shame on you too...&apos;Surely England can&apos;t lose this now?&apos; I mean really. I know you&apos;ve been on holiday but things haven&apos;t changed that much in two weeks.&quot;  37th over: England 163-4 (Morgan 41, Prior 2) need 213 Prior gets off zero with a sweep to short fine leg where Samaraweera fumbles the ball, much to Murali&apos;s irritation.  38th over: England 166-4 (Morgan 42, Prior 4) need 213 With England needing 50 runs from 78 balls, Sanga throws the ball to Malinga, giving him his third spell of the innings. Was Shah stumped, caught, or bowled? Well truth be told I sprinted to the toilet as soon as I saw the umpire&apos;s finger go up and was still there when they were showing the replays so I&apos;ve no idea. Everyone else seems to think he was caught though, so I&apos;ve indulged in a little retrospective editing. Yet more Stalinist journalism here on the OBO.  39th over: England 169-4 (Morgan 43, Prior 5) need 213 Prior pushes a single down to long-on, and the game rather dawdles onwards to its conclusion.  40th over: England 170-4 (Morgan 43, Prior 6) need 213 Prior cuts away a run from the first ball, and Morgan then spends the rest of the over trying, but failing, to get Malinga off the square. Possibly irked by his temporary ineptitude, Malinga whistles a visious bouncer past Morgan&apos;s nose and indulges in a long follow-through, standing staring and snorting at the batsman.  41st over: England 180-4 (Morgan 44, Prior 14) need 213 Prior clips two runs out to mid-wicket off Murali, and then, after a pair of singles, he drops to one knee and slaps a slog sweep past deep backward square for four. Murali&apos;s ten overs have cost a rather flabbergasting - given that this is England after all - sixty runs, ten of them from that last over.  42nd over: England 186-4 (Morgan 51, Prior 15) need 213 Morgan raises his second fifty for England by thrashing a high-risk straight drive through mid-off and away to the rope for four. The shot almost cost him his wicket, but the ball burst through the fielder&apos;s hands and raced on to the boundary. It&apos;s been a fine innings, albeit a very lucky one too.  43rd over: England 194-4 (Morgan 53, Prior 20) need 213 Prior belts four down the ground, and then tries to leather four more through extra cover but bags only a single as he picks out the sweeper. More grumbles about the Beeb come from Keiran Taylor: &quot;I thought I&apos;d put the radio on to listen to the cricket and the BBCs dedicated sports channel are broadcasting some deeply boring men talking about their sunday league team - Jarrow. Bloody Jarrow FC. The England Cricket team are playing live and the BBC thinks the nation will be more interested in Jarrow Football Club. Not even people who live in Jarrow give a flying one about them. Maybe I can go onto sports extra and hear live commentry of Huddesfield U-12s 5-a-side football team.&quot;  44th over: England 205-4 (Morgan 61, Prior 21) need 213 Malinga flings down another wide, and then peppers Morgan with short balls. He&apos;s looked very uncomfortable against Malinga all night long, taking three runs from the 16 balls he&apos;s received from him. And then, of course, just as I type that, Morgan clatters four runs through backward point as Malinga allows him a little too much width. The response is an eye-wateringly quick bouncer that speeds past Morgan&apos;s head. He&apos;s not put out by this though, and he carves the sixth ball of the over for four past cover. That&apos;s almost his finest hot of the innings.  45th over: England 213-4 (Morgan 61, Prior 27) need 213 &quot;Blimey,&quot; gawps Sally Ledger, &quot;I&apos;m actually starting to believe. Eight from six overs... do you think we can scrape over the line now?&quot; Prior forces two through extra cover, cracks four more through the same area and then takes a single to allow Morgan to squirt the winning run out to cover off his edge. Well who&apos;d have thought it. England have won by six wickets.  The English team are all grinning like loons which seems fair enough given few people thought they had even the remotest chance of winning this - least of all myself. &quot;Speaking of Strictly&quot; says my old mucker Andrew Fraser, and I wasn&apos;t actually speaking of Strictly at all, but what they hey, &quot;Zoe Lucker&apos;s on which makes me think have we got the wags (and Gary Kirsten) to thank for this? Or is it just the theory that you put 11 chimps (in whites) on a cricket pitch and eventually they&apos;ll win a 50 over match?&quot;  Atherton and Nasser are grinning like schoolboys - they both called it correctly at the start of play. I&apos;d love to stay and talk a little longer, but I&apos;m not going to, &apos;cause it&apos;s late and I&apos;m tired and confused. I&apos;ll be back here on Tuesday for England&apos;s next match, see you then. Thanks for all the company and emails, and cheerio."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/25/interview-daniel-galmiche", "sentences": ["&quot;We&apos;re doing a nice dish at the moment which is a fillet of John Dory with a little bit of more Asian influence, because I lived in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T07:00:00Z", "title": "Interview: Daniel Galmiche", "tags": ["Chefs", "Food & drink"], "article": "When I suggest that he might be regarded as a high achiever, Daniel Galmiche agrees. Since he joined his first restaurant at 15, near his home in Franche-Comt\u00e9, the chef has made his career in establishments spangled with Michelin awards, well-padded with extraordinary luxury, or both. He might not have the profile of other top-flight chefs but, from pre-Mayfair Le Gavroche to Cliveden Manor via Harvey&apos;s in Bristol, he&apos;s got the experience. &quot;I&apos;m not the type to advertise myself too much,&quot; he says, in an oozy French accent that could give Raymond Blanc a run for his Euros. &quot;I work away.&quot; It&apos;s just as well that Galmiche has barely been out of prestige kitchens for 35 years; his new job requires him to step into the classic big clogs. In October, he will replace &apos;cerebral chef&apos; John Campbell as king of the kitchen at The Vineyard at Stockcross, in Berkshire. Campbell, who is joining new super-luxe hotel Coworth Park when it&apos;s built, leaves behind a hotel that looks like a Texan oilman&apos;s dream ranch but contains a handsome two-star dining room and a huge cellar of owner Sir Peter Michael&apos;s Californian wines.  The Vineyard&apos;s reputation is for carefully controlled, scientifically thought-out dishes which are joyously simple to eat. How is Galmiche going to follow that?  &quot;My style is very different to John&apos;s,&quot; he says. &quot;John&apos;s cooking is very molecular, a little bit between Heston and a bit of Spanish influence, within the modernity of food, using a lot of [setting agent] agar and this kind of thing. I&apos;m a modern classic but more light, colourful but very tasty cooking. Will The Vineyard&apos;s customers accept it? Yes, I think so, because it&apos;s a style people recognise. A lot of people go to the south of France and will recognise the style and relate to it, I think.&quot;  When Galmiche says light, he means it. At 50, (&quot;It&apos;s OK, I feel great!&quot;) he swims, cycles and goes for long walks, and the energy comes from a &quot;very healthy&quot; diet.   &quot;It&apos;s a job where you have access to everything you want and in this trade you need to be careful. I don&apos;t eat a lot of fat, I don&apos;t eat a lot of dairy except goats&apos; cheese, I don&apos;t drink too much at all, I don&apos;t smoke. If I have to eat dairy at work I do, but for myself, no. I specialise in fish, sauces and game. There will be quite a lot of fish on the menu; it&apos;s fresh, it&apos;s light, it&apos;s interesting.&quot;   The signature dish he&apos;ll be bringing with him from his last job, at the Forbury hotel near Reading reflects his wider travels.   &quot;We&apos;re doing a nice dish at the moment which is a fillet of John Dory with a little bit of more Asian influence, because I lived in Singapore. I use a syrup made with different chillies and Sichuan pepper which we brush on one side, and the fish is steamed just for a couple of minutes and finished under the grill. We do that with broad beans and a very tiny jus made with the carcass of the fish, and add at the last minute some lime and lime zest. It&apos;s really delicate and interesting with the touch of sweetness and spice, and not that easy a recipe. I know I make it sound easy, but the cooking of the fish is not. This kind of dish will be full of colour and flavour, and I think people will like that.&quot;    Galmiche will also bring a team of French staff for front and back of house (&quot;it doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t work with English people!&quot;) and intends to loosen things up in the dining room. &quot;You need to remember we are feeding people,&quot; he says. &quot;They need to like the place and come and be happy and comfortable in every way. You go to some places in London and it&apos;s so formal you wonder whether you should speak when you eat. I don&apos;t want this kind of place. It&apos;s not normal.&quot;  Lunch will be deliberately accessible, he says.   &quot;The offering for lunch in London at the moment is tremendous; you can eat in a one, two or three star for lunch for very good value for money, with seasonal produce, perhaps a different cut of meat. That&apos;s what we need to do, especially in recession time. For lunch, we&apos;ll be doing something where people think, &apos;great, we can go to the Vineyard now because I can afford it, because I don&apos;t have to fork out 200 quid per head.&apos; It&apos;s a big problem now. People don&apos;t have this spending power, and the same for me.&quot;  That said, The Vineyard is part of an elite group of two-star British restaurants, and Galmiche has not been brought in to drop one. &quot;The Vineyard is in the top 10 in the UK in ratings, which is very important for me,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve been a Michelin-starred chef for 22 years, and I&apos;ve been craving a second star for a while. Obviously the challenge is to keep the rating, and I feel very good about that. Very confident.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/25/today-in-sport-25-september", "sentences": ["\u2022 Meanwhile in Singapore, Alan Henry will be bringing us all the pit lane news that&apos;s fit to print ahead of this weekend&apos;s Singapore Gran Prix.", "A Renault Formula One team car with its sponsor's branding removed prior to the start of the first practice session on the Marina Bay City Circuit in Singapore Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP    Here we see a picture of a Renault car and garage stripped of the branding of their main sponsor, ING, prior to first practice at this weekend&apos;s Singapore grand prix.", "Renault&apos;s driver Romain Grosjean has crashed in Singapore GP practice on exactly the same corner as Nelson Piquet Jr, which subsequently created this whole hullabaloo."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T08:56:25Z", "title": "Today in Sport - as it happened", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": " 10.02am: Good morning and welcome to our rolling sports news blog. The idea is we post stories, links and try to keep you abreast of what&apos;s expected to happen in the hours ahead. The reality is occasional flashes of activity followed by long periods of quiet. Apologies for such delays; the day job often intervenes. Please continue to post your questions and comments below, we&apos;ll wade in as often as we can. GR  10.10am: We&apos;ve just had the morning meeting, which featured some people in swivel chairs and some other people leaning against a large cabinet type thing reading hastily scribbled notes from a variety of modes of paper ranging from wirebound notebooks to the back of cigarette packets.Anyway, here&apos;s some of what&apos;s coming up today ...  \u2022 Everton have called on Blackburn Rovers striker El Hadji Diouf to apologise for accusing their supporters of racially abusing him by throwing bananas, when all the (lack of) evidence suggests that he may well have been, er, mistaken. It&apos;ll be interesting to see how that one develops.  \u2022 A verdict is expected in the Newcastle United-Kevin Keegan tribunal today. The independent arbitration hearing was convened to settle the dispute between Kevin Keegan and Mike Ashley over the former&apos;s departure from Newcastle United a year ago. \u2022 We&apos;re also expecting a charge in the West Ham v Millwall Carling Cup hoopla.  \u2022 With a full card of Premier League matches coming up over the weekend, there&apos;ll be the usual glut of press conferences from the usual suspects. With a tricky visit to Stoke City to look forward to, will Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson be in a good mood (hands behind his head, leaning back in his chair, basking in the obsequious, undeserved laughter generated by his unfunny jokes) or a bad one (glowering sullenly and giving short shrift to anyone who dares ask him a question). \u2022England take on Sri Lanka today in the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa. Andy Bull will be providing over-by-over coverage from 1.30pm.  \u2022 Mike Averis and Paul Weaver will be chipping in to our County Cricket blog, with the former reporting from Derbyshire&apos;s match against Essex and Paul Weaver telling us what&apos;s going on between Notts v Sussex.  \u2022 Meanwhile in Singapore, Alan Henry will be bringing us all the pit lane news that&apos;s fit to print ahead of this weekend&apos;s Singapore Gran Prix. With ING and Mutua Madrilena having ended their sponsorship deals with Renault  in the wake of the crashgate scandal at last year&apos;s race, we&apos;ll bring you photographs of the Renault cars sans logos and livery as soon as we can.      A Renault Formula One team car with its sponsor's branding removed prior to the start of the first practice session on the Marina Bay City Circuit in Singapore Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP    Here we see a picture of a Renault car and garage stripped of the branding of their main sponsor, ING, prior to first practice at this weekend&apos;s Singapore grand prix. The eagle-eyed among you will have noted that the mechanic/engineer pictured with the car still has the company&apos;s livery on his shirt. What&apos;s the betting that&apos;ll be covered by gaffer tape before the weekend is out, unless Renault can get a job-lot of new uniforms delivered? [BG]  11.30am: Have you made your selections for this weekend&apos;s Pick The Score yet? I was sitting pretty on top of the Guardian Sports Desk league, went on holidays and forgot all about it for two weekends, now I&apos;m languishing in mid-table. Bah! [BG]  11.39am: Flavio Briatore has been speaking in Italy about his F1 ban and he sounds particularly revved up about the whole affair. He has vowed to fight back against his ban and has vowed to exact revenge on the people who betrayed him in his &quot;own world&quot;. [GR]  11.46am: You wanted them. Well here they are. Paolo Bandini&apos;s NFL Six Pick Here&apos;s the Pick Six for this week&apos;s game. I haven&apos;t included Kansas City&apos;s trip to Philadelphia \u2013 because frankly the Eagles should win at a canter \u2013 but in case anyone had forgotten, Michael Vick will be eligible to play in that game, his first in the regular season since he got out of prison. Should be interesting. Washington Redskins @ Detroit LionsIf the Lions lose this one they become just the second team in NFL history to drop 20 consecutive regular season games, but quite a few people are picking them to win at home against at Redskins team who don&apos;t know how to finish their drives on offence (last week five trips to the red zone against the St Louis Rams yielded three field goals and no touchdowns). Sadly I&apos;m not among them.Redskins to win San Francisco 49ers @ Minnesota VikingsThis is the only game this week between teams with unbeaten records. Both like to run the ball and both know how to stop the run, but ultimately the game may be decided by how much production each team can get out of its passing game. For Minnesota Brett Favre \u2013 who will be making his home debut - has been completing more than three-quarters of his passes, but his average of 5.5 yards per attempt is third-lowest in the league among starters. San Francisco&apos;s Shaun Hill, meanwhile, doesn&apos;t always make it look good, but is now 9-3 when he starts. This for me is the toughest call of the week, but I&apos;ve got to make one, so \u2026Vikings to win Atlanta Falcons @ New England PatriotsThe Falcons took a huge blow when the rookie defensive tackle Peria Jerry sustained a season-ending knee injury last week against the Carolina Panthers. Thomas Johnson, who had been out of the NFL for two seasons before Atlanta picked him up this year, looks set to fill in on a defensive line that already lacked depth and that may create opportunities in the running game for New England. That said, Matt Ryan and the Falcons offence look good right now, while Tom Brady still seems to be feeling his way back in for the Patriots. Falcons to win Tennessee Titans @ New York JetsThe Titans must be the best 0-2 team in the league \u2013 capable of putting up points, as they did last week, and also of keeping an opponent&apos;s scoring in check, as they did in week one. What they haven&apos;t managed so far is doing both those things on the same week. Tennessee do have one obvious weakness, however, and that is their pass defence, which has been torched for 678 yards in two games. If the Jets are going to win, they&apos;ll probably need to do it through the air, which is a big ask for the rookie quarterback Mark Sanchez. Nevertheless, I&apos;m backing Rex Ryan&apos;s team to get the job done.Jets to win Denver Broncos @ Oakland RaidersGoing on the bookies&apos; judgment, this should be the closest game of the weekend \u2013 with Denver given a 1.5 point edge on the early betting lines. Whilst I&apos;m far from sold on the Broncos, I just don&apos;t think I could back any team whose quarterback is completing little more than a third of his passes this season.Broncos to win Indianapolis Colts @ Arizona CardinalsThe Colts have won both their games this season, but Peyton Manning aside they haven&apos;t looked all that special. The Cards were sloppy in week one, but as receivers Anquan Boldin regain full fitness after injuries, this offence is going to start firing again.Cardinals to win [PB]  12.11pm: &quot;Isn&apos;t it ironic,&quot; warbled Alanis Morissette once upon a time without really understanding the true definition. Well here&apos;s as good a definition of sporting irony you&apos;ll ever get. Renault&apos;s driver Romain Grosjean has crashed in Singapore GP practice on exactly the same corner as Nelson Piquet Jr, which subsequently created this whole hullabaloo. &quot;Sorry guys, I lost the car on Turn 17,&quot; he sobbed. [GR]  1.10pm England have won what looks to be a decent toss in their Champions Trophy opener against Sri Lanka and will bowl first. Can they extend their winning run in ODIs to two? No. But you can follow their defeat with Andy Bull&apos;s over-by-over report. RS  1.45pm: From Mike Tyson going down (behave) to Kenny Dalglish resigning, we recall half a dozen of sport&apos;s great &apos;where were you?&apos; incidents in The Joy of Six: JFK Moments (four of which, rather eerily, occurred on the 22nd of the month).  3.48pm: Sri Lanka have recovered well after a terrible start against England in the Champions Trophy. You can look in on the action with Andy Bull here. But if you much prefer the serenity of the county game (and fewer live posts) this live blog will be right up your street.  For those of you who were asking about any news from the Kevin Keegan tribunal I&apos;m afraid we&apos;re in the dark just as much as you are. It may drop this afternoon or it may rumble on. There is further news on the sketchy backdrop to the Notts County takeover story. It has emerged that Russell King, a senior figure in the consortium behind the takeover of Notts County, had \u00a32m of his assets frozen in Jersey. And for those of you who subscribe, the Fiver is currently on the production line, working its way towards completion. I&apos;ve just spotted Barney Ronay emerge from a shower of sparks wearing a welder&apos;s mask. [GR]  4.54pm: Afternoon all. It&apos;ll soon be time to wind this blog down for the day, but in the meantime here&apos;s a blog from Lawrence Donegan, who was as just as shocked as you will be to find that some professional golfers hold right-wing views.

In similar scenes today, the safety car was again called out as the debris from Grosjean&apos;s car was removed. The revelations surrounding the 2008 crash have caused the then team principal Flavio Briatore to be banned from motor sport indefinitely for his part in the affair, while the team&apos;s chief engineer Pat Symonds was banned for five years. Renault were given a two-year suspended sentence and that decision has caused two of their sponsors, ING and Mutua Madrilena, to end their deals with the team. ING, the principal sponsor, had already confirmed they would not be continuing their support after the end of this season; however they terminated their contract with immediate effect after the ruling.

The 23-year-old Frenchman, who on Thursday had seemed unlikely to compete as he was confined to bed with stomach cramps, pirouetted his car embarrassingly to rest against the concrete barrier. The session was suspended so that his car could be retrieved. &quot;Sorry guys, I lost the car in turn 17,&quot; said the driver over the team radio. &quot;Today was my first experience of the Singapore circuit.

We still have a lot of work to do, but it will be possible to find some more speed for tomorrow.&quot; Grosjean had simply put his foot down too hard when the car was on some dirt and not gripping the track properly, an episode which caused much mirth among Grosjean&apos;s colleagues. The Renault team could be permitted a smile after enduring a series of unsettling moments over the past week. First, the team principal, Flavio Briatore, and technical director, Pat Symonds, resigned over the race-fixing controversy, then the team was handed a suspended sentence on Monday and yesterday morning the cars appeared without their ING and Mutua Madrile\u00f1a logos after they withdrew their sponsorship four races early over the affair. It was hard to think of a more public display of disapproval about the grubby race-fixing allegations. To get things back on an even keel, Renault arrived in Singapore with the position of team principal and chief technical officer awarded to Bob Bell, previously the technical director, while Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Caubet, formerly the director of marketing and communications, stepped into the role of managing director. They will report directly to Bernard Rey, the president of the Renault Formula One team. They may be less glamorous and high profile than Briatore and Symonds but Bell and Caubet are regarded as a safe pair of hands to steer the team through to the end of the season in undramatic and hopefully unobtrusive fashion. Bell, a quiet and highly respected engineer, admitted that he was stunned by the revelations that engulfed the team. &quot;It is a dream job obviously, but in very difficult circumstances,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;I am taking a very pragmatic and realistic approach to it. The team needed somebody to step in and see through the rest of the season. I have agreed to do that. I am very happy to do it. My motivation as ever is to see that the team continues and continues successfully and I am very proud that I have been asked to do it and I relish the challenge.&quot; Asked whether he had to be something of a crisis manager, Bell admitted he did not really know: &quot;I think there are so many times nowadays that you feel you need to reach for a book of law rather than a book of engineering when you go to work in the mornings. It is a sad reflection on Formula One, but it is a fact of life. &quot;I think for the ordinary guys in the factory, and indeed for all of us, myself included, we were quite genuinely sitting there thinking we could potentially lose our jobs over this. How are we then going to pay the mortgage? &quot;We do genuinely subscribe to the view that we are a real racing team and most people in the team feel themselves as being a member of a family, an extended family, and we are very proud of it. But we were never comfortable with the situation we found ourselves in, and the consequences that we could have gone out of business as a result.&quot; Caubet added that it was crucial Renault&apos;s Formula One team should embrace a change of culture to avoid anything like this happening again. &quot;We don&apos;t want to return to the 1980s, when Renault corporate [philosophy] controlled the team,&quot; he said. &quot;But we do not want to make the same mistakes that have occurred by the team having 100% control.&quot; Although the sponsors&apos; details were easily stripped from the cars, the mechanics&apos; ING badges, firmly machine-stitched on to their race shirts, proved a little more of a challenge yesterday, with team members unsure if they should buy new shirts, cut off the logos or wear them regardless. It seems that the team will have to struggle through the weekend with their current kit before it is replaced in time for next Sunday&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix. There had been a mood of guarded optimism pervading the Renault garage at Marina Bay as the cars trickled out on to the circuit to begin practising for the second night race to be held under floodlights on this spectacular circuit. Twelve months ago, Renault were being feted as worthy winners after their No1 driver, Fernando Alonso, dodged every hazard on his way to what had seemed like a brilliantly opportunistic and tactically astute victory. Forget the fact that his team-mate, Piquet Jr, had spun into the wall after 14 laps. These thing happen, after all, particularly to novices. After the team returned to the same track with its world turned upside-down, the team&apos;s personnel found some sympathy from Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal. Having been involved in the notorious controversy in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix when the team&apos;s sporting director, Dave Ryan, was found to have lied to the stewards over an overtaking manoeuvre involving Lewis Hamilton, he understood how his rivals felt. &quot;I must say I sympathised with them quite a lot when I saw Grosjean spinning,&quot; he said, &quot;as I could imagine just how many people were laughing. But in my experience I think it is episodes like this which tend to bring a team together. You just have to get your head down and concentrate on the business of the day which, lest we forget, is the actual racing and not the background politics.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/26/crackers-northampton-delapre-abbey-gardens", "sentences": ["This latest piece will only get a one-off UK performance but it has already been seen as far afield as Sydney and Singapore, where this kind of big outdoor show is treated, sadly, with more respect than often happens in this country."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T23:01:00Z", "title": "Theatre preview: Crackers?, Northampton", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Central listings", "Culture"], "article": "Can fireworks ever be art?

She slows down to wave to a young woman with her two children: &quot;Both those were born at home,&quot; she murmurs, &quot;as was the mother.&quot; A deer ambles across the road. Every so often, a clearing reveals a ramshackle house with a rusting 70s school bus in the driveway. We overtake a large, bearded teenager on a bicycle. &quot;That guy just fell into my hands,&quot; she chuckles. &quot;He was enormous.&quot; A closed community of 300 people, the Farm was founded in 1970 by a group of idealistic beatniks who travelled here in convoy from San Francisco. It&apos;s now the closest thing to the last hippy commune on earth. For four decades, it has been Ina May&apos;s domain. Revered as one of the world&apos;s most knowledgable experts on natural birth, she has delivered most of the Farm&apos;s current inhabitants and seen more than 2,000 births. Her experience is unique. Because the Farm is relatively cut-off from civilisation, Ina\u00a0May has the knowledge and experience of a\u00a0midwife working hundreds of years ago. Some might call her methods primitive or even brutal \u2013 they&apos;re certainly hippyish. But to her fans, she&apos;s just helping women do what comes naturally. A big noise in the natural birth movement since the mid-70s, suddenly, at 69, Ina May is becoming a household name. The talkshow host Ricki Lake featured her in the campaigning homebirth documentary The Business Of Being Born. Actor Isla Fisher and TV presenter Davina McCall have pronounced themselves fans of her first bestselling book, Spiritual Midwifery, a charming 1977 tome that is as much a historical document (&quot;Birth is far-out!&quot;) as a guide to childbirth. She is the only midwife \u2013 and only woman \u2013 in history to have an obstetric technique named after her, the Gaskin manoeuvre (moving on to all fours to release the baby&apos;s shoulders). Her new book, Ina May&apos;s Guide To Breastfeeding, is a collection of advice and anecdotes described by the US&apos;s bestselling health writer, Dr Christiane Northrup, as &quot;the best thing ever written on the subject&quot;. Speaking from Los Angeles, Ricki Lake enthuses, &quot;Ina May is my inspiration and my hero. When I was newly pregnant with my first son, I\u00a0happened to read Spiritual Midwifery. The book is very dated, but it&apos;s what inspired me to want a natural birth. Her passion is infectious.&quot; It turns out celebrity status could have come a lot quicker. In\u00a01988, Ina May had a call from one Demi Moore, then pregnant with her first child, Rumer. Moore wanted to send a helicopter as soon as she went into labour. But Ina May didn&apos;t want to attend anyone who wouldn&apos;t come to the Farm. &quot;And I\u00a0didn&apos;t really know who she was.&quot; She shrugs. Hollywood is a world away from Ina May&apos;s existence \u2013 she and her husband, Stephen, now 74, live in a basic but cosy log cabin. When she wrote Spiritual Midwifery, it was full of hippies describing how &quot;psychedelic&quot; and &quot;trippy&quot; their wives looked in labour: &quot;It does a man good to see his lady being brave while she has their baby \u2013 it inspires him.&quot; When I meet Stephen, himself the author of cult bestseller Hey Beatnik!, he hands me a book of pictures of the original Farm: Cat Stevens lookalikes with long, flowing hair and huge beards tending the crops, women in flowery kaftans breastfeeding their babies, unkempt children making their way to school through fields. Looks like you got to live your Utopian dream, I say. Stephen laughs: &quot;Utopia means nowhere. The Farm has a zip code.&quot; &quot;It looks like fun,&quot; Ina May says, &quot;and it almost always was. You didn&apos;t need to watch a soap opera: there was one happening all around you.&quot; Wearing a purple wrap top, jade necklace and tiny glasses, Ina May&apos;s face is framed by wisps of grey hair. She recently cut it for the first time since 1968 (it used to be down to her thighs and she often wore it in Princess Leia braids). She wears the slightest slick of pink frosted lipstick, a\u00a0new addition since she watched herself in the Ricki Lake documentary. &quot;At my age you have to do what you can,&quot; she laughs, &quot;although there&apos;s no way I&apos;m ever dyeing my hair.&quot;     Ina May Gaskin in the late 70s, on the commune she set up with her husband Photograph: Ina May Gaskin    We sit and talk over homemade zucchini bread and tea. In their heyday, Ina May says, the Farm&apos;s community swelled to 1,200 people and her team of midwives handled around 30 births a month. Now it has eased back to 10, many from the large Amish community in the surrounding countryside. Outsiders come from all over the world \u2013 most recently from Ireland and Singapore \u2013 to have their babies. (The Irish woman, a surgeon and an Elvis fan, made a last-minute pilgrimage to nearby Graceland before having her baby a few days later.) A private delivery here costs $3,500 with $300 a week for accommodation. You pay extra, of course, if you end up going into hospital in Columbia, a half-hour drive away, but with Ina May&apos;s statistics \u2013 a 95% homebirth rate \u2013 that&apos;s unlikely. Even more impressively, many of the births she has handled are usually regarded as high risk and not recommended outside hospital: more than 20 sets of twins, several hundred births by women who have had more than five pregnancies (most of them Amish) and more than 90 breech births, including several feet first. All delivered naturally with no pain relief and no complications. It&apos;s worth noting, however, that her team has effectively worked in a cultural vacuum: all the mothers she has treated are a self-selecting group, committed to natural birth. The Farm is popular with middle-class American mothers who like to do things holistically. In some states, homebirth is illegal. In others midwives struggle to find hospital jobs; 24 states do not even recognise midwifery as a practice. All of this has contributed to a 30% caesarean section rate (compared with 24% in the UK). &quot;It has moved to assembly line production.&quot; Ina May sighs. &quot;Most births in the US now happen between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.&quot; She adds that there is no postnatal care in any state; no required visits by midwife or health visitor. Ina May is not confident that the changes Obama is pushing for will help: &quot;We don&apos;t have a health ministry. And the insurance companies have an insatiable appetite.&quot; Bonnie Reed, 37, a teacher from Bowling Green, Kentucky, a two-hour drive away, came here to have Margaret, her second child, now five days old. &quot;Yes, with a natural birth you have a lot of intense sensations,&quot; she laughs, &quot;but it&apos;s over instantly.&quot; This is her second birth on the Farm: Truman, two, was also born here and he, like dozens of other babies, has his footprint on the wall of the birthing room in a log cabin in the forest. Reed once worked as a birthing advocate in New York for four years, helping women to get the &quot;natural&quot; birth they wanted in a\u00a0hospital setting, and has seen first-hand that it&apos;s virtually impossible. In her home state, she says labouring women are shaved and given enemas as soon as they arrive at hospital, and homebirth is not legal, so if she had stayed at home, she would have\u00a0had to find a midwife willing to operate outside the law. &quot;That&apos;s the sad part. I had to travel two and a\u00a0half hours to get the birth I wanted.&quot; Ironically, the cost of going outside the system\u00a0is far less than she would have paid had she gone into hospital: $10,000 for a vaginal birth,\u00a0Reed says, and up to double that for a\u00a0C-section. (Obviously, your insurance \u2013 if you had it \u2013 might cover some or even all of that.) &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t understand why they don&apos;t encourage midwifery,&quot; she adds. &quot;It&apos;s less expensive.&quot; Ina May agrees, of course. She had her first baby in hospital in the late 60s and says it was a\u00a0terrible experience. &quot;I was offended by what happened [she was given anaesthesia without her\u00a0consent], then they expected me to pay for it!\u00a0I was so pissed off.&quot; A graduate from the English faculty of the University of Iowa, Ina May became a midwife by default. At the age of 30, following a few years as a\u00a0volunteer in the Peace Corps, she was travelling with the convoy that was eventually to settle at the Farm. As one of the few women (most in their late teens and early 20s) who already had a child, she attended her first birth \u2013 somewhat reluctantly \u2013 on board a bus in 1970. Weeks later, two more babies were born in a truckers&apos; garage in Wyoming. It was -20C outside. At first she struggled with the\u00a0idea of becoming &quot;the midwife&quot;, but then accepted it was her vocation. &quot;I had to learn not to\u00a0let anyone push me around, to be brave and to say things I knew might make people mad.&quot; Ina May now sees her early life as having led her towards midwifery. Her father, Talford, grew up on a farm in Iowa that was lost to the bank during the Depression. He later became a salesman, but Ina May grew up around farming and was close to a grandmother (her namesake) who ran an orphanage. Her mother, Ruth, taught home economics. Ina May had an older brother and two younger sisters. The brother died in a freak gun accident at the age of 15: it taught her compassion and the importance of grieving, she says. She got married in 1959, aged 19, to an arts student. &quot;I didn&apos;t know how to say no and I didn&apos;t want to hurt his feelings.&quot; The two of them went to Malaysia with the Peace Corps. She became a\u00a0hippy late, she jokes, at 28. Two years later she met Stephen through her first husband when they were in San Francisco. There, Stephen was running his legendary Monday Night Class where he drew crowds of 1,500 students wanting to share his philosophy of peace and spirituality. This was the era of free love and, as\u00a0Ina May puts it, &quot;We were two couples together for a while. Things got very complicated. It was about challenging norms. I don&apos;t like to talk about it because I don&apos;t want to be defined by it.&quot; She and Stephen soon ended up together, and she set off on the road with him, with her toddler daughter in tow. Within a year, the pair had become the focus of the Farm community: Stephen was the unofficial guru, Ina May the community&apos;s midwife, pouring her own experience into her bedside manner \u2013 in the early 70s she had two miscarriages and a premature baby who died. Much later, her eldest child, Sydney, died from a brain tumour just after her 20th birthday. Her surviving children are Eva Marie, 37, a teacher, Samuel, 35, a personal trainer, and Paul, 34, a web designer \u2013 all were delivered on the Farm. She has six grandchildren. Some of the farm&apos;s birthing ethos is harsh: in Spiritual Midwifery, there is an extraordinary scene where a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby is told off by a Farm midwife (not Ina May) for being &quot;complainy&quot;. The mother takes it as good advice and stops moaning. Despite her passion, Ina May says she would never talk any woman into a homebirth. &quot;But we do think that hospital birth could be informed by what we learn at home.&quot; The Farm&apos;s C-section rate remains at a tiny 1.4%. Ina May&apos;s techniques ensure that almost two-thirds of the women she delivers keep their perineum intact. She notes in her figures from 1970 to 2000 that, out of 2,028 births, eight babies were lost. This number includes the Farm&apos;s first infant death, Ina May&apos;s own premature son who had a rare heart condition: &quot;I\u00a0felt grateful it was me and not another mother.&quot; Other babies were stillborn or too premature. But she says she has never lost a\u00a0baby due to\u00a0the birth being at home. The maternal mortality rate in 39 years is zero. During a Farm birth, you apparently do not experience pain, you have &quot;interesting sensations to which you must pay full attention&quot;. You do not have contractions, you have &quot;rushes&quot;. In all her years of midwifery, Ina May has only ever known one woman who couldn&apos;t cope (there is no pain medication at the Farm, not even gas and air) and was taken to hospital at her own request. &quot;We use a lot of tricks,&quot; she says. &quot;We tell stories, we keep calm, we prepare the woman for how she&apos;s going to feel. Sometimes humour \u2013 even if it&apos;s gallows humour \u2013 is what works best. It&apos;s good to laugh at times that feel inappropriate.&quot; Ina May&apos;s no-nonsense attitude stands in opposition\u00a0to the culture of fear that surrounds non-medicalised birth in the US. She has an interesting theory about this. In 1900, half of all US households lived on farms. Now only 1% live on the land. &quot;It makes it easier to dupe people. They don&apos;t know animal behaviour and they have no basic understanding of birthing processes or of\u00a0nature.&quot; Her\u00a0latest campaign is for increased awareness of maternal death: there has been no improvement in maternal death rates in the US since the 80s. Rather, statistics show the rate has increased, from 7.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1982 to 11 in 2005 \u2013 and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believe the true figure could in reality be as much as three times higher than that reported. Several years ago, Ina May founded the Safe Motherhood Quilt Project (a giant quilt featuring the names of women who have died in childbirth, most from complications following C-sections and inductions) and is building up her own bank of statistics. &quot;I\u00a0started to add the names of women who had died. It looked to me like we weren&apos;t counting carefully, like we weren&apos;t even trying. It\u00a0might be possible that now a C-section here\u00a0is\u00a0actually more dangerous than in, say, the\u00a0UK.\u00a0Meanwhile, internationally, people are\u00a0unwittingly copying the worst model for obstetrics in the world.&quot; As her work on maternal mortality gathers pace, there is an increasing sense of urgency. Ina May will be 70 next year and her husband Stephen, recovering from several eye operations, is physically frail, though as charismatic as ever. Despite the efforts of a few celebrity mothers, homebirth remains an alternative experience, especially in the US. She\u00a0worries that things are getting worse for women, not better. &quot;We are seeing whole populations moving towards, &apos;Cut me open.&apos; They don&apos;t realise that abdominal surgery can be dangerous. It&apos;s a lack of confidence in the idea that the body could have been made right and that it is possible to give birth without horrific injury.&quot; Things are so desperate, she says, that she has\u00a0taken to juggling with plastic turds on her international lecture tours to try to make people\u00a0feel more at ease with talking about bodily\u00a0fluids and internal processes. &quot;Why are women so afraid of poop?&quot; Ina May sighs, as she packs her bag for another check-up. There&apos;s one consolation, at least. &quot;I dreaded having a boring life when I grew up. And I certainly can&apos;t complain about being bored.&quot; \u2022 Ina May&apos;s Guide To Breastfeeding is published on 1 October by Pinter &amp; Martin at \u00a311.99.

Sir Martin Sorrell, who is on the board of the firm which owns Formula One&apos;s commercial rights, CVC Capital, made clear his dissatisfaction at Ecclestone&apos;s remarks. &quot;First we had Hitler did good, now we have cheating is acceptable,&quot; Sorrell told the Daily Mail of Ecclestone, who is chief executive of the company that administers the rights on CVC&apos;s behalf. &quot;Where will it end? His latest comments are yet another example, I&apos;m afraid, of Bernie being totally out of touch with reality.&quot; Sorrell was also critical of Ecclestone in July for saying that Hitler &quot;got things done&quot;, comments for which Ecclestone later apologised. Ecclestone is not alone is feeling that Briatore was treated unfairly, however. Ferrari&apos;s president, Luca di Montezemolo, may have moved up the guest list for Briatore&apos;s planned celebration yesterday when he said the colourful Italian&apos;s long-term ban was excessive. &quot;I&apos;m humanly very sorry for Flavio Briatore, who has been one of Formula One&apos;s main players in the last 20 years,&quot; he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. &quot;It is a serious and delicate matter but I hope and wish this punishment he has received will soon be reduced.&quot; Briatore shied away from revealing whether he would appeal against the FIA decision or even take civil legal action. Meanwhile, out on the circuit, two of the drivers who are handled by Briatore&apos;s management company ended the first of the practice sessions to be held under floodlights among the top four fastest competitors. Sebastian Vettel was fastest, 0.27sec ahead of Briatore&apos;s star prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Fernando Alonso, the winner of last year&apos;s controversial race here at the Marina Bay circuit, with Heikki Kovalainen, also one of Briatore&apos;s men, third in the McLaren-Mercedes. It remains to be seen how promptly Alonso and Kovalainen, together with Mark Webber and Romain Grosjean, will have to disentangle themselves from their contracts with Briatore after the FIA handed down its blanket ban on the former Renault team principal&apos;s presence on, or involvement in, the international racing scene. Webber, who was fastest early in the session, spun into one of the retaining walls, damaging his Red Bull Renault.The Australian was particularly frustrated as he was anxious to cover as much mileage as possible, concerned that his slim chance of grabbing the world championship crown might be slipping away on a circuit on which he did not expect to have the pace hinted at by Vettel when it comes to tomorrow&apos;s qualifying session. &quot;I think we have already seen in Monaco and Valencia that they [circuits like Singapore] have been probably not our best circuits of the year compared to others,&quot; said the Australian, who trails the championship leader, Jenson Button, by 28.5 points with four races to go. &quot;But it doesn&apos;t mean we are going to be at the back massively. We&apos;re still going to be in the hunt but we won&apos;t have an advantage. The stop-start nature of these tracks is something we will look to improve our form on next year.&quot; Button&apos;s Brawn-Mercedes was fifth fastest behind Nick Heidfeld&apos;s BMW Sauber while Lewis Hamilton, evaluating aerodynamic modifications which included a new floor and front wing package on his McLaren, finished the session a guardedly optimistic ninth. Button said: &quot;The venue is a tough one with the heat and humidity to contend with and the nature of the circuit and the closeness of the barriers demand your total concentration.&quot; Speaking during commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live on the practice session, Sir Jackie Stewart commented on Bernie Ecclestone&apos;s and Max Mosley&apos;s endorsement of Jean Todt as FIA presidential candidate: &quot;I&apos;m disappointed that the president should support anyone. Bernie and Max are the most powerful people in Formula One. For them to come out and support one individual candidate, I personally don&apos;t think this is correct.

The 29-year-old Brawn driver faces an uphill struggle to protect his 14-point championship lead from his team-mate Rubens Barrichello, who finally qualified fifth after slamming into the wall with 20 seconds of the session left. He will start tomorrow&apos;srace from 10th after taking a five-place penalty for replacing his car&apos;s gearbox before qualifying. Button started the year with six wins out of the first seven races, building up an early points lead which, since mid-season, has steadily been eroded by Barrichello since the Brazilian recovered from a wobbly period of paranoia when he seemed to believe that the team were favouring his British colleague. Barrichello&apos;s subsequent impressive victories in the European and Italian grands prix went a long way to expunging this sense of suspicion, although Button&apos;s second place at Monza also confirmed the British driver&apos;s return to form after last winning in Turkey at the start of June. Lewis Hamilton will start from pole in his McLaren, with the Red Bulls of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber second and fourth, sandwiching Nico Rosberg&apos;s Williams. &quot;I am very happy and pleased for the team,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;We came with updates for the car this weekend and we were not quite sure where we would be in the overall picture. The lads had to work all night to change the chassis on the car and they did a fantastic job in this terrific humidity. My best lap was quite relaxed and I think we will be strong in the race. I reckon we had another couple of tenths in there, for sure.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s car was rebuilt around a new chassis after a complex failure of the wiring to its Kers system. The task was easier than attempting to replace the damaged wiring in the field 7,000 miles away from the team&apos;s Woking base. It was the fall-out from last year&apos;s controversial inaugural Singapore grand prix that has dictated much of the agenda this weekend. Renault, already battered and bruised by the revelations that had led to the abrupt sacking of their team principal, Flavio Briatore, and the executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds, sustained another blow on Friday morning when Dutch-based banking giant ING and Spanish insurance company Mutua Madrilena terminated their sponsorship contracts, with four of the season&apos;s 17 races still to run. For Renault engineer Bob Bell, suddenly promoted from technical director to team principal to fill the void left by Briatore&apos;s departure, these were stressful days indeed. With the team having been delivered a suspended lifetime ban from the sport at last week&apos;s meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council and the loss of these key sponsors, although late in the season, Bell knew that his workforce were as concerned for their mortgage payments as they were for good grid positions for drivers Fernando Alonso and Romain Grosjean. &quot;I think for the ordinary guys in the factory, and indeed all of us, we were quite genuinely sitting there thinking we could potentially lose our jobs,&quot; he said. At least Renault managed to puncture this stifling ball of tension, albeit inadvertently, when Grosjean, the man who replaced miscreant Nelson Piquet in the second Renault seat a couple of races ago, managed to spin into the wall at the same place as the Brazilian had crashed deliberately in last year&apos;s race. Another rumbling sub-text is the continuing rivalry between Jean Todt, the former Ferrari team principal, and the 1980 world rally champion Ari Vatanen, in the battle to win the FIA presidential election that takes place on 23 October. Both men have been at Singapore, schmoozing the media and arguing their case among the paddock fraternity \u2013 although the collective view is that Todt, an ascetic and not altogether charismatic individual, has the edge after a campaign endorsed by the current incumbent Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone. &quot;I am disappointed that the president [Mosley] should support anyone,&quot; said the former three-time world champion Jackie Stewart. &quot;Bernie and Max are the most powerful people in Formula One. For them to come out and support one individual candidate, I don&apos;t think this is correct. But they have done it and they&apos;ve been very vocal.&quot; Ecclestone, meanwhile, was fighting fires on another front after Sir Martin Sorrell, a co-director of CVC Capital Partners, owners of F1&apos;s commercial rights, slammed the 78-year-old for apparently sympathising with Briatore&apos;s life ban. &quot;First we had Hitler did good,&quot; he said, &quot;and now we have cheating is acceptable. Another example, I&apos;m afraid, of Bernie being totally out of touch with reality.&quot; Ecclestone responded testily: &quot;If he thinks he can run Formula One better than I can then let him try. Let&apos;s see how long the sport would last then.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/27/christianity-models-agency-fashion", "sentences": ["MOL claims to have affiliates in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, Canada, Australia and Europe."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-26T23:06:55Z", "title": "Christian modelling agency preaches spiritual fulfilment to the fashion world", "tags": ["Fashion", "Christianity", "Models", "Religion", "Life and style", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "The small, Asian girl approaches the tall, white girl on a Northern line tube heading out of King&apos;s Cross and asks her if she is a model. The tall girl, who is startled but flattered, demurs. &quot;But you are so tall, you should be,&quot; the small girl says, before starting up a conversation and introducing a friend who, judging by her striking looks, appears to come from eastern Europe. The pair represent an organisation called Models of Life that is scouring London and other cities for fresh modelling talent. The small girl scribbles down her details and hands a card to the tall girl, urging her to check out the organisation&apos;s website. Similar approaches are being made every day to girls by modelling agencies looking to find the next Kate Moss or Agyness Deyn. But Models of Life (MOL) is unique, for it is the first organisation of its kind operating in Britain that seeks to mix Christianity and the catwalk. According to its impressive website, dominated by pictures of smiling young women, MOL &quot;has its beginnings in the 1990s when the founder sought to challenge and to renew modelling culture. Its philosophy, based on Christian values, is to make people aware that modelling is about leading an exemplary life and exuding inner beauty.&quot; In the rarefied world of modelling where new fads are accepted in a nanosecond, Models of Life&apos;s philosophy stands out starkly. &quot;To be a model is to set an example,&quot; it proclaims. &quot;Just at a time when the controversy over skinny models reflects how the perception of beauty is evolving, MOL aims to raise the standard of models to a new height: beauty achieved from the perfect balance and unity of spirit, mind, and physical body.&quot; It might sound like the sort of platitude spouted by Derek Zoolander \u2013 the male supermodel portrayed by Ben Stiller in his parody of the fashion industry \u2013 but a model who claims to have benefited from MOL&apos;s classes, 20-year-old Ruth Kadereit, says the approach works. &quot;I think it really helped me to use my time better and accept myself,&quot; she says on the website. &quot;[It helped me] understand and remind myself of the value of life and live with joy each day.&quot; Girls keen to follow Kadereit&apos;s example are encouraged to sign up for MOL&apos;s popular modelling classes, the next round of which are due to be held at a dance studio in Fulham this week. Several Anglican churches have also been used to hold MOL fashion events in the past and a vicar spoken to by the Observer said he was a great believer in its work. Those who may have doubts about MOL&apos;s philosophy will perhaps be reassured by its size. It seems to have the sort of global presence that many of the leading modelling agencies can only envy. MOL claims to have affiliates in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, Canada, Australia and Europe. Its models have featured on catwalks around the world, even appearing in South Korea at football&apos;s World Cup finals opening ceremony in 2002, an event that was watched by hundreds of millions. The organisation&apos;s attempt to bring a spiritual element to the world of modelling may seem baffling: as Matthew 5:28 observes: &quot;Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&quot; But the nexus between religion and modelling is well documented in the US where a Models for Christ ministry was established in 1984. &quot;We are a global community of professionals who are seeking to honour God as we navigate the unique opportunities and challenges within the fashion industry,&quot; the not-for-profit ministry proclaims. Then there is the Christian Talent Network, a New York-based organisation that promises clients it will find &quot;possibilities available for you in the exciting world of modelling and TV commercials&quot;. One of America&apos;s original supermodels, Kim Alexis, who in the 80s was a face of Revlon, is a born-again Christian who has become an anti-abortion activist. More recently, Kathy Ireland, a Californian model, has published several books expressing her faith, including Real Solutions for Busy Moms: 52 God-Inspired Messages for Your Heart. Conversely, MOL appears reluctant to talk about its relationship with religion or indeed anything else. Repeated requests for an interview last week with the organisation were rejected. Little more can be gleaned about it other than that its international website was set up by someone who gives their address as a small flat in Battersea and the main players behind its European division, founded two years ago, are said to be three women from South Korea. The organisation appears to file no accounts and has no permanent UK headquarters. One person familiar with the organisation&apos;s modelling classes said they featured little more than &quot;rather limp modelling&quot; but seemed popular and were attended by scores of aspiring models: &quot;It was just about telling people how to walk \u2013 they are generally all girls in the classes and very tall girls at that.&quot; A woman called Hannah Park who books venues for the organisation, declined to talk to the Observer. &quot;What is the problem with what we are doing?&quot; she asked. &quot;In any high street you will find modelling agencies approaching young girls, that is how they operate.&quot; Indeed. But Laurie Kuhrt, chairman of the Association of Model Agents, which represents the UK&apos;s top agencies, questioned whether religion and the catwalk can make for happy bedfellows. &quot;If they&apos;re genuinely trying to make contact with people with a view to turning them into good, honest Christians, I don&apos;t have a problem with that,&quot; he said. &quot;But modelling is not about exuding inner beauty, it is about selling goods and services. When we recruit people it&apos;s solely because we think they can do big advertisement campaigns and appear on catwalks. If they can&apos;t do that, we lose a lot of money.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/27/juan-pablo-montoya-nascar", "sentences": ["As Formula One desperately tries to put its house in order in Singapore, a purer and arguably more dramatic form of motor sport gets into its stride today on the opposite side of the world \u2013 with an ex-Formula One man among the leading contenders.", "Compare this to reports that FIA officials were apparently aware of Renault&apos;s Singapore skulduggery a few months after the event.", "Sorrell was referring to Ecclestone&apos;s view that Flavio Briatore&apos;s life-time ban over the Singapore scandal was very harsh."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-26T23:10:04Z", "title": "Former grand prix star Juan Pablo Montoya is riding high in Nascar | Maurice Hamilton", "tags": ["Nascar", "Formula One", "US sports", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "As Formula One desperately tries to put its house in order in Singapore, a purer and arguably more dramatic form of motor sport gets into its stride today on the opposite side of the world \u2013 with an ex-Formula One man among the leading contenders. Juan Pablo Montoya has qualified second for the Nascar race on the Monster Mile oval at Dover in Delaware. Montoya&apos;s presence on the front row ahead of homegrown talent in 42 other saloon cars from Dodge, Ford, Toyota and Chevrolet is a rare event in a world where outsiders, particularly people from F1, find it difficult to cope with both this highly specialised form of racing and the fact that politics are dealt with behind closed doors. Nascar is no more immune to rule\u2011bending than any other form of sport but the France family, who founded the series in 1948, use a home-made rod of iron to rule the second most popular spectator sport in the United States. There have been outrageous attempts at cheating \u2013 a competitor once went so far as make the shell of his car 10% smaller than the actual size \u2013 but offenders are dealt with swiftly. Nascar&apos;s word is final. Compare this to reports that FIA officials were apparently aware of Renault&apos;s Singapore skulduggery a few months after the event. It is one of the many thoughts that appals Sir\u00a0Jackie Stewart as the three-times world champion watches his sport continually implode. &quot;I understand the FIA had knowledge of this last November,&quot; Stewart said on BBC Radio 5 Live. &quot;It&apos;s also been reported that it was brought to their attention again in April of this year. If that&apos;s the case, why was it not dealt with at that time? Why was it put off to this time, so close to an election and the end of the season? I\u00a0don&apos;t think it was just the fact that the timing was right. There&apos;s something a\u00a0little bit wrong with all of that. &quot;I don&apos;t see any reason why they had to wait. They have access to the telemetry, it could have been investigated. The referee in a football match doesn&apos;t wait for the spectators to tell him there should be a penalty. He makes that decision straight away and that decision is clear.&quot; Stewart was referring to next month&apos;s election of a successor to Max Mosley, the president of the FIA. Further controversy in a supposedly democratic process has been caused by Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone giving public support to Jean Todt, their favoured candidate over Ari Vatanen, a more popular choice in the F1 paddock if not many parts of the motoring world. The fear is that Todt, if elected, will continue the policies of two men arguably past their prime, particularly Ecclestone who has been described as &quot;totally out of touch&quot; by Sir Martin Sorrell, a board member of CVC, the owner of F1&apos;s commercial rights. Sorrell was referring to Ecclestone&apos;s view that Flavio Briatore&apos;s life-time ban over the Singapore scandal was very harsh. Such public washing of F1&apos;s filthy linen is anathema to Nascar officials as they watch the supposed pinnacle of motor sport continually attempt to self-destruct. The fundamental values, however, ought to be exactly the same as the F1 and Nascar championships head towards a climax, F1 moving to Japan next weekend, followed by Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Nascar has entered the final 10 races, the so-called &quot;Chase&quot;. After 26 races, the top 12-ranked drivers advance to the Chase to contend for the championship. The 12 drivers&apos; points are reset to a base of 5,000 points per driver. During the Chase, normal scoring applies, with drivers who win a race receiving 190 points for the win, five bonus points for leading a single lap, and 10 points for leading the most laps. It sounds complicated, but the system works and keeps interest on the boil until the final round. There will be eight more races after today. Montoya, although in only his third season, is one of the top 12. Having reached the Chase through consistency, the Colombian is set to use the thrusting talent exhibited when he won seven grands prix for Williams and McLaren. Montoya was on pole for the first round of the Chase in New Hampshire but was denied his first Nascar win on an oval track by the series leader, Mark Martin. Aged 50 and in his 27th season of Nascar, Martin used his guile to legitimately block Montoya on the last lap, a tactic that would cause outrage in F1. &quot;Nah, it was OK,&quot; said a grinning Montoya. &quot;I&apos;d made a pit stop and passed a ton of cars. I got to Mark and thought I had him. When we got to turns one and two, he just sort of stopped on the bottom [instead of running high through the banked turns]. I didn&apos;t expect that. He just ran pretty defensively. I haven&apos;t fought for enough wins, so I&apos;m still learning. &quot;Was I screwed? Yes, I was. But I would have done the same thing. You just gotta learn from it. He&apos;s the guy I respect most. He hasn&apos;t won a championship and he wants one pretty bad. So do I.\u00a0But I&apos;ve got to win a race first. It&apos;ll\u00a0come.&quot; F1 can only hope that its own race today, run under floodlights, is without shadowy figures influencing what ought to be an intriguing championship in its own right."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/27/lewis-hamilton-wins-singapore", "sentences": ["Lewis Hamilton scored his second victory of the season at the Singapore grand prix as Jenson Button extended his title lead by one point, to 15, despite a poor qualifying position.", "The 11th-placed finisher Nico Rosberg had been an early contender but his chances of repeating last year&apos;s podium finish in Singapore were dashed when the Williams driver crossed the white line while leaving the pits after his first stop.", "I go to Japan very positive for the next race.&quot; Singapore grand prix result (after 61 Laps) 1 Lewis Hamilton (GBR) McLaren 1hr 56mins 06.337secs 2 Timo Glock (GER) Toyota 1:56:18.971 3 Fernando Alonso (SPA) Renault 1:56:22.961 4 Sebastian Vettel (GER) Red Bull 1:56:26.598 5 Jenson Button (GBR) Brawn GP 1:56:36.352 6 Rubens Barrichello (BRA) Brawn GP 1:56:38.195 7 Heikki Kovalainen (FIN) McLaren 1:56:42.494 8 Robert Kubica (POL) BMW Sauber 1:57:01.391 9 Kazuki Nakajima (JPN) Williams 1:57:02.391 10 Kimi Raikkonen (FIN) Ferrari 1:57:05.229 11 Nico Rosberg (GER) Williams 1:57:06.114 12 Jarno Trulli (ITA) Toyota 1:57:19.346 13 Giancarlo Fisichella (ITA) Ferrari 1:57:26.227 14 Vitantonio Liuzzi (ITA) Force India 1:57:39.839 Not Classified: 15 Jaime Alguersuari (SPA) Scuderia Toro Rosso 47 Laps completed 16 Sebastien Buemi (SWI) Scuderia Toro Rosso 47 Laps completed 17 Mark Webber (AUS) Red Bull 45 Laps completed 18 Adrian Sutil (GER) Force India 23 Laps completed 19 Nick Heidfeld (GER) BMW Sauber 19 Laps completed 20 Romain Grosjean (FRA) Renault 3 Laps completed World Championship standings Drivers: 1 Jenson Button 84pts 2 Rubens Barrichello 69 3 Sebastian Vettel 59 4 Mark Webber 51.5 5 Kimi Raikkonen 40 6 Lewis Hamilton 37 7 Nico Rosberg 30.5 8 Fernando Alonso 26 9 Timo Glock 24 10 Jarno Trulli 22.5 Manufacturers: 1 Brawn GP 153pts 2 Red Bull 110.5 3 Ferrari 62 4 McLaren 59 5 Toyota 46.5"], "publicationDate": "2009-09-27T14:13:37Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton wins Singapore grand prix as title battle intensifies", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Jenson Button", "McLaren", "Brawn", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton scored his second victory of the season at the Singapore grand prix as Jenson Button extended his title lead by one point, to 15, despite a poor qualifying position.

Meanwhile Renault&apos;s Fernando Alonso gave his team something to cheer about at the circuit that has caused their recent woes by claiming third place. &quot;It was a very, very tough race,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;I got a good start and I just managed to bridge a big enough gap. I have to say a big thank you to my team for doing a great job as always.&quot; Button followed Sebastian Vettel home, having overhauled his Brawn team-mate Rubens Barrichello at the Briton&apos;s last stop, to take fifth. It means he has extended his championship lead by one point with three races remaining as Barrichello finished sixth ahead of Heikki Kovalainen. Robert Kubica picked up the final points position after a late-race battle for eighth, holding off Kazuki Nakajima and Kimi Raikkonen. The 11th-placed finisher Nico Rosberg had been an early contender but his chances of repeating last year&apos;s podium finish in Singapore were dashed when the Williams driver crossed the white line while leaving the pits after his first stop. Rosberg had made an excellent start to pass Vettel on the opening lap but was forced down the order thanks to a drive-through penalty. The situation seemed to play into the hands of Vettel, who looked set to challenge Hamilton for the lead, but the Red Bull driver was himself given a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pitlane. He also damaged his car by running wide over a kerb but recovered to finish the race in fourth place, leaving him 25 points behind Button. Mark Webber, who went into the race with slim title hopes, crashed out in the closing stages through brake trouble. The accident led several teams to bring drivers, including Hamilton and Barrichello, into the pits early in case of a safety car period, although this did not transpire. This played into Button&apos;s hands as the Brawn driver was able to stay out for a long middle stint and make up ground while his rivals struggled with heavier cars. It had seemed as though Button might challenge Vettel for fourth but the Brawn driver was told to hold back and protect his position. &quot;It was a good day for us,&quot; said Button. &quot;I was happy to get Kazuki [Nakajima] off the line; that was key for me.

But Hamilton reminded Button that he had been 17 points ahead with two races to go in 2007 and lost the title. &quot;My advice to him is to continue pressing hard all the way to the finish,&quot; he said. This was the 11th career victory for Hamilton and his second of the 2009 season, clearly giving him huge satisfaction to have performed with such a blend of speed and precision on the challenging Marina Bay circuit, where even a slight slip can result in smart contact with the unyielding concrete walls, as several other drivers found out. &quot;I had to do all I could to look after my tyres today,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a very tough race, I think I can speak for all of us. But it was seriously straightforward for me, a nicely controlled race. I knew I was running five laps longer than Sebastian [Vettel] when he was running behind me. &quot;My only slight problem came when the team came on the radio saying there might have been a problem with the KERS [energy regeneration] system but I wasn&apos;t seeing that. We made some adjustments, pressed some buttons and re-booted the system and it worked well. &quot;It&apos;s corner after corner after corner on this track, so it is hugely demanding. I came here hoping to redeem myself after the last race [crashing on the last lap at Monza] and I think I did, we did. I looked after my tyres and it all went well.&quot; Alonso loyally dedicated his best finish of the season to Flavio Briatore, the former Renault team principal who was banned from the sport by the FIA after his involvement in the so-called &apos;Crashgate&apos; scandal. &quot;It was fantastic, obviously great to get our first podium finish of the year,&quot; said the Spaniard. &quot;The team has been fantastic; the mechanics, engineers and everybody did a great effort. Now we have put the troubles behind us but I would like to dedicate this podium to Flavio because it has a lot to do with him as well. We made no mistakes, kept 100% concentration throughout and, although we didn&apos;t have the pace, I felt we could get a podium if we kept out of trouble and we did the job.&quot; As for the championship leader Button, this was a damage-limitation exercise after qualifying a distant 12th, a performance that left him looking uncharacteristically dejected and downbeat. The Brawn driver has generally displayed admirable resilience when it has come to dealing with the fluctuating fortunes he has experienced this year but now his head dropped. After a slightly baffling mid-season dip Button&apos;s second place at Monza a fortnight ago convinced him that he had turned the corner and was firmly back on track with his championship challenge. Yet instead of reinventing himself for a sprint to the title crown, missing the top-10 cut in Singapore consigned him once more to jostling for scraps from the table, picking up a point here and a point there as he and Barrichello limp towards the season&apos;s finishing line in Abu Dhabi on 1 November. In contrast Hamilton drove superbly to plant his McLaren-Mercedes on pole position even though the car had to be rebuilt on Friday night around a new chassis after a complex failure was suspected deep within the car&apos;s electrical wiring. This was a fiddly and time-consuming job for the McLaren mechanics, who toiled through the long hours of darkness in the extreme humidity, having only the briefest of breaks for a shower and some food on Saturday morning before heading back to the circuit to prepare the car for qualifying. At the start Hamilton repaid their dogged efforts superbly. Taking full advantage of the extra burst of power available from his car&apos;s KERS system, he rocketed cleanly away from pole position to lead Nico Rosberg&apos;s Williams by 10 lengths by the time they reached the first corner. In the opening stages Rosberg did a great job following Hamilton but the German driver&apos;s hopes of a strong result evaporated after he incurred a drive-through penalty for running over the white line at the end of the pits while returning to the race after his first refuelling stop, dropping him to the back of the field. After Rosberg faded, Vettel took up the challenge, piling on the pressure with his Red Bull Renault, but Hamilton, secure in the knowledge of more fuel, sufficient to keep him out five laps further than hisGerman rival, refused to be ruffled and drove just as fast as was necessary to keep ahead without unduly straining his McLaren. It was textbook stuff and Vettel, even before he took a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, had no answer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/27/britain-high-speed-rail-link", "sentences": ["Rail investment is a progressive cause, if we don&apos;t want to see London as a sort of Singapore, a first world island isolated from \u2013 and perhaps one day refusing to fund \u2013 an impoverished hinterland."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-27T19:30:00Z", "title": "A fast rail link could make all of Britain middle class | Julian Glover", "tags": ["Politics", "Transport", "Transport policy", "UK news", "Travel", "Rail transport"], "article": "There&apos;s a moment in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon when a locomotive runs out of control on a desert railroad being built through the wild west. As the train roars down the track towards an unfinished bridge over a canyon, Bugs frantically throws down sleepers and hammers rails in place until, against the odds, the line stays ahead of the engine and the train is saved. Andrew Adonis is trying to transform British transport, Bugs Bunny style. At breakneck speed he&apos;s making tracks before the north-south high-speed railway, on which he is so keen, derails. The transport secretary is a late entrant to a collapsing cabinet, the money has run out, and the time for big plans from this government has passed. No one listens to Labour ministers any more except to hear them moan. If anyone else at conference this week announced a multibillion-pound project to start in Labour&apos;s fifth term and finish in its seventh, they&apos;d be laughed off the end of Brighton&apos;s Palace Pier. But somehow, laying out the route as fast as he can before the government comes crashing down, Adonis has kept his railway dream running. It&apos;s a triumph of optimism from which all policy-makers can learn, the heads-down-and-charge school of government, the antithesis of Gordon Brown&apos;s paralysing addiction to delay. Brown himself is not a true believer, daring not being in his soul, but todayhe put his name to the foreword of a pamphlet backing it. Tomorrow he will no doubt applaud when Adonis and Ed Miliband speak on Britain&apos;s green future. This railway, as they used to say, is getting there. Much that has caused Labour to stumble over the last decade came from a confusion between the collective good and state command. Adonis is a liberal: he knows he can&apos;t order a new line to be built (or that if he does, it won&apos;t happen), but that projects like this will not come alive spontaneously just because there&apos;s a public need. He can plant the seed of the idea, help it grow, nurture a sense of expectation \u2013 even inevitability \u2013 and shape the circumstances. This scheme is something only government can make possible, but cannot carry alone. He&apos;s trying to bind everyone in so that cancelling it will seem like the surprise, and going ahead the natural course of action. And the more partners he ties in, the harder any government will find it to pull the plug: a benign version of Eurofighter. He&apos;s also fighting British exceptionalism, the attitude that harrumphs at big schemes as dubiously foreign \u2013 even uses a French phrase with an implicit sneer, grands projets \u2013 preferring incremental improvements that in the end turn out to save less and deliver less. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats&apos; shadow chancellor who is going strangely wobbly on funding London&apos;s Crossrail route, seems tempted by this. When the rest of Europe is pressing ahead \u2013 even underpopulated Sweden is planning a fast line \u2013 the onus ought to be on opponents to say what&apos;s wrong with our fellow Europeans&apos; argument, rather than on supporters to make and remake a case that almost everywhere else has been accepted. You will never prove, for certain, that a fast line linking London, Birmingham, Manchester and points north must be built; all we can say is that it can be and that if it happens no one will regret the effort. Pundits predicted doom for the Channel tunnel, but now it&apos;s there, who wants to wall it up? Great projects demand a touch of vertiginous self-belief. Starry-eyed insistence is what made the Brunels geniuses. Of course, much remains to be settled about high-speed rail \u2013 most of all the financing, although the big bills won&apos;t arrive until 2015, when public finances should be less tight. There&apos;s also the question of where it should go. In December, engineers at the High Speed Two company will propose a specific route from London to the Midlands, and a broad route north from Birmingham. It&apos;s telling that so far the debate is more about where the scheme should run than where it shouldn&apos;t. High-speed rail can be justified as green if we sort out non-fossil fuel electric power, but the case is really as much social and economic. The unspoken aim of British politics is to make all of Britain middle class, and the middle classes travel \u2013 and will do so more and more. It&apos;s best if they go by train. Faster journeys are a bonus; the gains are as much about reliability and capacity \u2013 good links between Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, as well as to London. Transport routes north from the capital are full, or soon will be. England&apos;s great cities cannot enrich themselves in isolation and the harder it is to get between them, the poorer they will be. Rail investment is a progressive cause, if we don&apos;t want to see London as a sort of Singapore, a first world island isolated from \u2013 and perhaps one day refusing to fund \u2013 an impoverished hinterland. At the election all main parties will support high-speed rail; the Conservatives and Lib Dems got there first. The Tories would love Adonis to switch sides if they win; he&apos;s resisted the appeal but like Tessa Jowell (the political face of the Olympics) or (it seems) Lord Mandelson he&apos;ll find it hard to walk away from a great project just as it starts to get interesting. Any fool can think of a dozen reasons why Britain&apos;s high-speed line will never run. The people who count are the ones who will make it happen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/27/lewis-hamilton-jenson-button-singapore-grand-prix", "sentences": ["Lewis Hamilton led from start to finish to take his second grand prix victory of the season in Singapore, but it was a fellow Briton, Jenson Button, who drove the &quot;perfect race&quot; to strengthen his title hopes."], "publicationDate": "2009-09-27T20:15:34Z", "title": "Jenson Button strengthens his grip on Formula One title with 'perfect' fifth place", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Brawn", "Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton led from start to finish to take his second grand prix victory of the season in Singapore, but it was a fellow Briton, Jenson Button, who drove the &quot;perfect race&quot; to strengthen his title hopes.

Yet after a difficult start to the year, battling with aerodynamic problems, McLaren and Hamilton have reasserted themselves as consistent front-runners, in contrast to Brawn, whose fluctuating form took another wobble with both their drivers off the pace. &quot;The temperatures make it a tough race, that&apos;s for sure,&quot; said Hamilton. &quot;There is never a real break and it [the track] is really bumpy. The focus you need here is as much as you can possibly get, but the track is fantastic. I also got to meet Beyonce here, so it has been overall an incredible weekend. I am very, very happy and I look forward to a great celebration tonight.&quot; In a move that could have caused some controversy in the closing stages, Barrichello threatened to close the gap on Button, despite team orders that he should slow down. By running further on his second stint with a heavier fuel load, Button vaulted ahead of the Brazilian at his last refuelling stop, after which both drivers were told to ease back to conserve their brakes. Button did so, driving with one eye on his mirror, but Barrichello kept his foot down and almost caught Button on the line. It took a while before the drivers exchanged pleasantries after the race, but that is what one expects from two team-mates who are battling for the world championship. Button was delighted. &quot;I came away with a result which doesn&apos;t look so good on paper, but it&apos;s almost like a victory to win these points,&quot; he said. &quot;I gained one point on Rubens and lost one point on Sebastian [Vettel] so all in all it is almost the perfect race. &quot;I&apos;ll go to Japan tomorrow feeling very positive and looking forward to the next race. Psychologically, you will have to ask Rubens. Factually, it means that I have won more points. I have a 15-point lead instead of 14 points.

The White House confirmed that the president, who had said he was unlikely to attend, due to his domestic political battle over healthcare reform, would lead a star-studded delegation in a bid to back Chicago against Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Madrid. Although Chicago was immediately installed as the favourite when the shortlist was narrowed to four in June last year, it has come under pressure from Rio as the Brazilian city&apos;s bid team, vocally backed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has made a compelling case for bringing the Games to South America for the first time. Obama&apos;s appearance in Copenhagen with his wife, Michelle, with both expected to deliver an address about their former home town and the transformative power of sport, could help wrest back the initiative. The arrival of Obama, with the attendant risk that his presence could backfire and damage Chicago&apos;s chances, will add an extra layer of intrigue to what is shaping up to be the tightest vote ever. Much will depend on the emotional punch of the final days of a two-year campaign. The news immediately energised the Chicago team as they conducted final rehearsals. With no IOC executive board meeting before the vote, there will be less time for last-minute horse trading in hotel lobbies. But the make up of each bid team, and their contribution to the final round of 45-minute presentations, is still expected to prove pivotal. IOC members believe it will come down to just a couple of votes. Whereas Beijing was the overwhelming favourite to win the 2008 Games, IOC sources say the way this race has evolved is similar to four years ago, when London pipped Paris to be awarded host status for 2012. A victory for Chicago, which will attempt to sell a vision of a compact Games on the shores of Lake Michigan that will leave a lasting sporting legacy, would return the Olympics to the most lucrative market in terms of sponsorship and television rights. But the city&apos;s campaign has been far from smooth. Until relatively recently the requisite financial guarantees were not in place and polls show public support to be at the lowest level of any bidding city. A dispute between the IOC and the US Olympic Committee over revenues from TV rights, together with the latter&apos;s plan to launch its own Olympic TV network, also threatened to harm Chicago&apos;s chances \u2013 though the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, recently said the row would have no bearing on the decision. While Rogge says the presence of high-ranking politicians is not a defining factor, several IOC members have said the absence of Obama would have been noted. The other bidders have high-level support, with King Juan Carlos of Spain supporting Madrid in a specially decorated private plane. Tokyo said on Sunday that the newly elected Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, would travel on its behalf. The IOC executive board has considered limiting government involvement to the sports ministers of bidding nations, but it rejected the idea because in some cases the head of state was also sports minister. Rogge said the presence of high-profile figures should not prove decisive but did little to discourage the prestige their presence adds to the bid process. &quot;We are very honoured and happy to host heads of states, dignitaries and heads of government,&quot; he said, earlier this month. &quot;[But] I don&apos;t consider this is the most vital aspect in a bid. This is something that is an honour for the IOC and is also reassurance that public authorities are behind the bid and will be supportive. &quot;However, this is absolutely not a requirement of the IOC. We have never asked a head of state to come but, if they elect to do so, we consider them as being part of the bid. If they come, we&apos;re glad. But we don&apos;t want them to come at all sakes.&quot; And Rogge did admit that the personalities behind the bids were a big factor, praising Lord Coe&apos;s Singapore speech as a key element of London&apos;s victory in the race to host the 2012 Games. &quot;All being equal in terms of technicalities, it&apos;s the confidence you have in the people making the bid,&quot; he said. It is widely accepted that Tony Blair&apos;s charm offensive on the eve of the 2005 vote in Singapore, when he flew halfway around the world to press home London&apos;s message before returning to Gleneagles to host the G7 summit, was also a decisive factor.

MediaGuardian.co.uk revealed in May that producer Impossible Pictures was trying to put together a deal to save the show, in which a group of scientists in present-day Britain fight prehistoric and futuristic creatures that have been transported through time. But ITV announced in June that it would not proceed. However, ITV today said it had agreed to share the next two series, comprising 13 episodes in total, with UKTV channel Watch after a deal was hammered out by Impossible Pictures and partner BBC Worldwide, which distributes the show internationally. In the new funding structure BBC Worldwide has overtaken ITV to become the largest partner, with BBC America \u2013 which broadcasts the series in the US \u2013 joining Germany&apos;s Pro7 as a co-production partner. ITV1 will premiere the fourth series of the show in early 2011. Watch \u2013 which already airs sci fi shows Doctor Who and Torchwood \u2013 will repeat it soon after and then premiere the fifth series later the same year, followed by ITV1. The new series will reunite the stars from the previous series, including Hannah Spearritt, Andrew-Lee Potts and Jason Flemyng, alongside the acclaimed special effects created by Framestore CFC. Showrunner Adrian Hodges will oversee the series. Tim Haines, creative director of Impossible Pictures, said: &quot;I am thrilled that ITV has agreed to this new deal, which will allow Impossible Pictures to produce another 13 episodes of Primeval. The confidence demonstrated in the programme&apos;s continued success here and abroad will help us bring more big-screen action and a whole host of new creatures roaring back into people&apos;s living rooms.&quot; Laura Mackie, director of ITV drama commissioning, added: &quot;We&apos;re delighted to have agreed this new deal with Impossible to return Primeval to ITV1. The innovative nature of this partnership will allow the show to maintain its high production values.&quot; The third run of Primeval launched with 5.3 million viewers in April. Impossible Pictures is developing a film version. ITV also announced the axing of its other Saturday teatime drama, Demons, in June, saying it wanted to concentrate on its peaktime drama.

The magnitude 7.6 quake was centred 32 miles north-west of the city in western Sumatra, said the US geological survey. Indonesia&apos;s vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, said at least 75 people had been killed and the deathtoll was likely to rise. &quot;Many others are trapped in collapsed shops, building and hotels. It is difficult to know because it is dark now,&quot; Kalla said at a late night press conference. Rustam Pakaya, the head of the health ministry&apos;s disaster centre, said a hospital near the epicentre had also collapsed. &quot;Jamil hospital collapsed and thousands of people are trapped in the rubble of buildings,&quot; Pakaya said. An earlier quake prompted a tsunami that struck the Pacific islands of Samoa and American Samoa, killing more than 100 people. Local reports said the Indonesian quake brought down buildings and bridges, damaged houses and started fires. Erwinsyah Sipahutar, a lecturer at the Padang Industrial Technic Academy told Indonesian website Tempo over the telephone: &quot;We were shaken like matchsticks.&quot; He said students had fled the campus as the earthquake hit and shattered most of the building&apos;s windows. &quot;A number of hotels in Padang have been destroyed,&quot; Rahmat Triyono, of the Indonesian geophysics and meteorology agency was quoted as saying by the Jakarta Post. &quot;Up to now we haven&apos;t been able to reach Padang. Communications have been cut.&quot; The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued an alert but later cancelled it. Tremors from the quake were said to have been felt in Malaysia and Singapore. A 6.2-magnitude aftershock followed the initial quake about 22 minutes later, the meteorological agency said. The earthquake came hours after another quake triggered a tsunami that left at least 100 people dead on the Pacific islands of Samoa and American Samoa. A resident described the scene to Indonesia&apos;s Metro Television. &quot;For now I can&apos;t see dead bodies, just collapsed houses. Some half-destroyed, others completely. People are standing around too scared to go back inside. They fear a tsunami. &quot;No help has arrived yet. I can see small children standing around carrying blankets. Some people are looking for relatives but all the lights have gone out completely.&quot; Other eyewitness accounts said people fled on to the streets as buildings collapsed. &quot;Hundreds of houses have been damaged along the road,&quot; Reuters quoted a witness as saying. &quot;There are some fires, bridges are cut and there is extreme panic here because water pipes are broken and there is flooding in the streets.&quot; Some telecommunications networks in West Sumatra were down preventing updates on the situation getting through, according to reports. The health ministry has dispatched medical teams carrying food supplies to Padang and Pariaman, also in West Sumatra, according to the Jakarta Post. Tempo reported that in Pekanbaru, about 125 miles north-east of Pariaman, and Jambi and Bengkulu, both 250 miles from Pariaman, people had fled houses and offices, spilling onto the streets. Padang, a city of 900,000 people, sits on one of the world&apos;s most active faultlines along the &quot;ring of fire&quot;, where the Indo-Australia plate and the Eurasia tectonic plate grind together to cause frequent tremors and, occasionally, large earthquakes. The same faultline caused the 2004 tsunami in which 232,000 people died in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and other countries across the Indian Ocean. &quot;Padang sits right in front of the area with the greatest potential for an 8.9\u00a0magnitude earthquake,&quot; Danny Hilman Natawidjaja, a geologist at the Indonesian Science Institute, said earlier this year. &quot;The entire city could drown in a tsunami triggered by such a quake,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/01/china-60th-anniversary", "sentences": ["Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, are all examples of successful authoritarian capitalist countries."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-01T07:00:00Z", "title": "The people's republic rising at 60 | Tim Dunne", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Today, 1 October, the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC) celebrates its 60th birthday. This is a good moment to evaluate what kind of country China has become. One might argue, as Churchill did of Russia, that it is &quot;a riddle wrapped up in mystery, inside an enigma&quot;. The enigma is the Communist party and its grip on power, and the mystery is whether an authoritarian power can embrace capitalism without sowing the seeds of its own demise. If there are many unknowns about China, perhaps the place to start is with what we do know. The PRC is a global power. It is a permanent member of the UN security council and plays an increasingly important role in the determination of international security concerns. From North Korea to Iran, China is a pivotal power in terms of multilateral measures to limit nuclear proliferation. To be a global power requires more than military might. In an age of globalisation, global powers have to be economic titans. China is certainly one of these. It has become the world&apos;s second biggest economy (or third if we are to count the EU as a single power rather than a union of 25 different countries). Its growth rate over the last three decades has averaged an annual rise in GDP of in excess of 10%. What, then, is the mystery? It might seem ironic to invoke Marx&apos;s analysis of capitalism to answer this question. Marx believed that capitalism&apos;s advance would not be halted by &quot;Asiatic&quot; modes of economic activity that he regarded as backward. Mao&apos;s successor, Deng Xiaoping, agreed with Marx and embarked on a course of modernisation that would have been heretical to the architects of the Cultural Revolution. Marx&apos;s other insight into economic development raises an altogether more haunting spectre for Chinese elites. He believed that social relations inevitably followed the path of economic progress. The more open and competitive an economy becomes, the greater the pressure to liberalise political institutions and democratise civil society. China wants the former while resisting the latter; the party, we are told by Chinese leaders, must retain a monopoly over ideas and institutions. The history of development in the west suggests economic and political liberalisation are inseparable. For capitalism to work efficiently, so the argument runs, political power must be ceded to political parties and organisations that represent the interests of the working class. In other words, far from being a threat to capitalism, social democracy is in fact essential to its durability. Ideologies of modernisation, whether they spring from the left or the right, imply that there is only one path to development. Asian economies have so far resisted this trend. Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, are all examples of successful authoritarian capitalist countries. The question is whether such a model could apply to a country as large and complex as China. The scale of the modernisation challenge facing the PRC should not be underestimated. It may be the second largest economy in the world, but remember also that it is not in the top 100 in terms of its level of income per head of population. What this suggests is that capitalism has so far only benefited a narrow segment of the urban middle class. That leaves hundreds of millions on the periphery, condemned to the informal economy and vulnerable to the ups and downs of the business cycle. The PRC government estimates that the global financial crisis has resulted in 20 million migrant workers losing their jobs. While economists probe the relationship between economic and political liberalisation, experts on international relations weigh up the relationship between economic and military power. Will a rising China become a threat to western interests? Leading US-based scholars answer this question with a straight &quot;yes&quot;. As John Mearsheimer argued in his book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, all previous global powers have first sought to dominate their region before pursuing competitors further afield. Why, he asks, should we expect China to be any different? The policy advice given by these so-called realists is that the United States should contain China&apos;s rise in order to maintain America&apos;s technological and strategic superiority. This may seem superficially sensible but in truth it is flawed. The flaw stems from believing that China is only interested in pursuing strategies that further its own national interest at the expense of the greater good. It is correct to argue that great powers have historically demanded that the regional leadership be respected; the United States has insisted this be the case in Latin America, and the EU has arguably played the same game, only through enlargement rather than the more overt method of threatening or using force. China believes it too can exert regional dominance by peaceful means \u2013 its neighbours; however, do not always see it this way. History suggests another dynamic associated with great power politics, and that is the importance of status. China&apos;s relationship with western countries can be fruitfully understood in terms of a struggle for acceptance. In the 1800s, China was denied the usual rights associated with sovereign statehood, including the right of non-intervention which was traduced during the opium wars and the diplomatic treaties associated with their aftermath, not least the annexation of Hong Kong for the British crown. One way of responding to China&apos;s rise is to recognise the importance of status. By and large this is happening: the US is no longer seeking to cajole China into democratisation. Instead of beating the drum of containment, as realists do, or insisting on compliance to western ideas, as liberals propose, a better policy is to enmesh China in the multilateral order such that it binds itself to the institutions and purposes of the system overall. Churchill&apos;s famous quotation about Russia implied that understanding the national interest was more predictable than trying to understand the particular traits and habits of a foreign culture. On this he was wrong. Getting to grips with the mystery of authoritarian capitalism, and the enigma of the struggle for status, is more likely to yield results in the case of China than relying on the riddle of the national interest."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/01/jenson-button-formula-one-championship", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve just had a few days in Tokyo following last Sunday&apos;s race in Singapore and I haven&apos;t been thinking endlessly what might happen.", "&quot;The changes that we made to the car for Singapore help us not just on slow-speed tracks but on high-speed circuits like this one."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-01T11:48:53Z", "title": "Jenson Button determined to win Formula One title 'fair and square'", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Brawn", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Jenson Button said he intends to win clean if he is to be the 2009 world champion in a sport that has had more than its fair share of controversy. As well as the Renault Crashgate affair, Button was referring to the history of drivers taking each other off the track in the sometimes desperate battle to take the title. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t mean so much to me if I deliberately collided with another driver,&quot; said Button. &quot;I&apos;d feel I&apos;d cheated myself. I&apos;m not the only driver who thinks that. If Rubens [Barrichello, Button&apos;s team-mate] was a different character, a team mate I hated, maybe I&apos;d think differently. But I&apos;m not in that situation. I&apos;d feel that I&apos;d cheated the people watching. &quot;I want to win fair and square because otherwise you&apos;d think &apos;I&apos;ve got this title and I cheated&apos;. What&apos;s the point in that? It&apos;s like doing a running race and taking a short cut and getting a really good time. You just don&apos;t do it.&quot; Button described the televised collision between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost as they fought for the 1989 title in Suzuka as one of his formative experiences. It was a clumsy but ultimately successful attempt by Prost to block a move by his McLaren team to snatch the lead in the closing stages of the Japanese grand prix. Senna was to exact his revenge in a more spectacular and dangerous manner in Japan 12 months later when he drove into the back of Prost, who had switched to Ferrari for the 1990 season. It was a controversial move that gave Senna the championship. Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill to win the title in 1994 but a similar move by Schumacher failed in 1997 when Jacques Villeneuve&apos;s Williams emerged largely unscathed. &quot;When I was a kid, Ayrton and Alain crashed at the chicane when they were team-mates and that stands out very well. I loved that because they were very different characters with very different styles of driving. I actually preferred Alain&apos;s style of driving but it made great television.&quot; Button leads Barrichello by 15 points with Sebastian Vettel, 10 points behind Barrichello, the outsider for Red Bull. If Button finishes Sunday&apos;s race 20 points clear, he will be world champion, regardless of what happens in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But the Englishman says arithmetic does not come into his thinking at this stage. &quot;I haven&apos;t come into this race thinking I am going to seal the title here; there are so many possibilities this weekend,&quot; said Button. &quot;There are three people who can still challenge for the title, and I am one of them. The most important thing to do is work on Friday and Saturday to get the car ready for qualifying and the race. I shouldn&apos;t be thinking about anything else. I&apos;ve just had a few days in Tokyo following last Sunday&apos;s race in Singapore and I haven&apos;t been thinking endlessly what might happen. &quot;When I&apos;m away from the circuit, I spend time with my friends and they know better than to talk about the championship. On the one hand, five points doesn&apos;t sound much. But to beat your team-mate by that amount when he&apos;s at his prime, as he is at the moment, is very difficult. It&apos;s a big margin.&quot; Barrichello said his options were clear. &quot;My aim is winning, winning, winning. It&apos;s pretty simple,&quot; said Barrichello. &quot;I&apos;ve been flat out for a long time. I&apos;ve got to win without worrying where Jenson is. Then, when the race is done, see how many more points I have.&quot; Button and Barrichello joined the majority of drivers in rejoicing over the Japanese race&apos;s return to Suzuka after two years at Mount Fuji. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to the weekend because it&apos;s a great circuit. I&apos;ve missed it a lot,&quot; said Button. &quot;It&apos;s possibly my favourite circuit and I love the atmosphere here. I&apos;ve pretty much had good results at Suzuka. I&apos;d love to get a win here; that&apos;s obviously going to be our aim. But, saying that, I think the Red Bulls are going to be the team to beat. &quot;The changes that we made to the car for Singapore help us not just on slow-speed tracks but on high-speed circuits like this one. This track has a bit of everything, fast corners, slow corners, rising and falling. You can get into a good rhythm and really enjoy driving a grand prix car round here. The weather forecast is interesting with rain forecast for Friday and Saturday. But Sunday should be dry. That will suit me.

The team that was responsible was relegated to Serie B. I saw this in Italy.

After travelling overnight, Barack Obama will today step straight from Air Force One into the cavernous Bella Centre conference hall to deliver Chicago&apos;s pitch and attempt to bring the Olympics back to the US for the first time since the underwhelming and chaotic Atlanta Games of 1996. As he does so, he will reconfirm the rebirth of the Olympics over the past three decades as an economic and cultural force. Despite the scrutiny, the threat of it all going wrong, the fact that no city bar Barcelona has created a lasting legacy and the impact of a global recession, the battle to stage the Games is more intense than ever. With the IOC&apos;s evaluation commission failing to declare a clear leader, and up to half of all the IOC members still believed to be undecided going into the final hours according to some, much will depend on the final push. Obama&apos;s late, perfectly timed decision to attend the vote has robbed Rio&apos;s attempt to make Olympic history by bringing the Games to South America for the first time of crucial momentum. But there may yet be a twist in the tale. Other bidders yesterday tried, in vain, to deflect attention from the arrival of the US president.

But Tokyo&apos;s message of safe streets and clean drinking water could not compete with the stardust of Chicago&apos;s delegation or the emotional pull of Rio&apos;s message. At his own press conference yesterday, Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attempted to turn Obama&apos;s presidential campaign slogan on its head and present Rio as a vote for change. &quot;We want to say yes we can. It sounds very pretty coming from an American mouth but in Brazil we are accustomed to saying &apos;No we can&apos;t&apos; because we have considered ourselves second-rate citizens,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we are looking out towards the world and saying &apos;Yes we can&apos; and &apos;We will win&apos;.&quot; But meanwhile, across town at a Marriot hotel swarming with security, Michelle Obama was conducting a second day of intensive wooing in a series of one-on-one sessions with influential IOC members. Downstairs, Oprah Winfrey was spotted working the lobby. The US president&apos;s entrance has been perfectly stage managed, from the final confirmation that he would attend the vote earlier this week to the arrival of his wife and Winfrey two days earlier to prepare the ground. And for all IOC president Jaques Rogge&apos;s hopes that the presence of heads of state would not prove decisive, the big names were clearly making an impressio. &quot;She is one impressive lady,&quot; said Kevan Gosper, a senior IOC member from Australia after meeting Mrs Obama. &quot;She has got great charm, great presence. She&apos;s very friendly, very informal, a very good listener. She&apos;s a great advocate for the Games.&quot; For the armies of lobbyists and PR professionals employed by the bidding nations this week represented a last intense round of rehearsals, meetings and press calls on a long 18-month road since the field narrowed to four. As the Madrid team touched down in a liveried plane on Wednesday, the Chicago delegation staged a glitzy red carpet welcome dinner and Pele held court on the merits of Rio&apos;s bid. Each is seeking the elusive final momentum that will carry them over the line. It will all come down to the choices of 106 IOC members \u2013 an uneven mixture of administrators, diplomats, minor royalty and former sportsmen and women influenced by a wide range of factors including geography, sentiment, personal loyalties, internal politics and the future of the Olympic movement, in addition to the technical merits of the four bids. Ever since the White House confirmed earlier this week that the US president would be stopping by today [FRI] to lobby on behalf of his former home town, the Tokyo, Madrid and Rio campaigns have been focused on how to neutralise the expected effect of his arrival. His wife, who arrived two days ahead of him with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, gave a flavour of what is expected to be a personal appeal when she spoke of her pride in her former home and the power of the Olympics to inspire future generations in front of hundreds of cheering supporters at an event on Wednesday night. &quot;They can never dream of being that close to such power and opportunity. So that&apos;s what excites me most about bringing the Games to Chicago, the impact it can have on the lives of our young people, and our entire community,&quot; she said. Michelle Obama, likened it to her husband&apos;s successful run to the White House saying the it was &quot;just like Iowa&quot;. It was, she said, &quot;an opportunity for the United States to connect with the world in a really important way at a very critical time and to show each and every person our sincerity and passion.&quot; Early concerns about a lack of public support and rows between the US Olympic Commission and the IOC over TV rights have faded as Obama&apos;s decision to attend has given the favourites fresh legs. A last-minute spat between the Madrid and Rio camps, after a senior official broke IOC rules on criticising rivals by saying the Brazilian bid was the &quot;worst&quot; in the race, caused no more than a minor ripple despite sparking a complaint to the IOC&apos;s Ethics Commission. But the bad blood could become a factor if one drops out of the race. It had previously been assumed that Madrid&apos;s backers would automatically turn to Rio, or vice-versa. Since the bidding process for the Olympic Games was overhauled in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, individual IOC members are no longer allowed to visit bidding cities themselves and instead reliant on the information supplied in the hefty &quot;bid books&quot; and the verdict of an IOC evaluation team, the importance of developing a compelling campaign &quot;narrative&quot; has come to the fore. Buzzwords such as legacy and sustainability have become de rigeur in the wake of London&apos;s success in 2005, with the IOC placing a premium on ensuring the Games reaches new generations and expands into new markets. &quot;For some countries, it is just one more sports event that they are going to organise,&quot; Silva said. &quot;But for us, it is a unique and extraordinary thing.&quot; There is a strong feeling among some in the Olympic movement that it needs to expand into new markets and practise what it preaches when it comes to &quot;universality&quot;. &quot;Although there is no geographical rotation, I think there is a feeling that the Games might go west,&quot; British IOC member Craig Reedie said. &quot;In which case, you have a choice of two Western Hemisphere cities. The emotional argument is with Rio with regards to the games having never been in South America before.&quot; Pele, one of the small army of former sporting stars drafted in by each bidding nations, declared: &quot;If I have to die for my country I will die for my country, it&apos;s important to help when your country needs you. I&apos;m not here just for Brazil but for the whole of South America. Sport has changed the life of a lot of people and children.&quot; Yet enough question marks remain over security, accommodation and transport that some IOC members will consider it too much of a leap of faith, despite the depth of experience on the Rio team and the fulsome financial guarantees provided by government at all levels. The tactical voting that tends to dominate the early rounds, where some members vote out of sympathy rather than for their genuine first choice, will also play a part. The winner needs a simple majority of all votes in a round to win, with the lowest scoring city eliminated. Ninety-seven IOC members are eligible to vote in the first round, with those from bidding cities disallowed unless they are eliminated. Rogge has said he expects there to be only a couple of votes in it. Nor can Madrid, which enjoyed the highest level of national public support and is politically well connected within the IOC, be entirely discounted. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said yesterday he was &quot;more optimistic than ever&quot; having spoken to more than 50 IOC members. For all the increasingly sophisticated and expensive planning, lobbying and positioning over a three year period, this Friday&apos;s vote could be swung by old fashioned rhetoric - President Obama&apos;s power and charm versus the emotional pull and increasing clout of President Lula, the stardust of Winfrey versus the cache of IOC &quot;athlete of the century&quot; Pele. There is no official rotation policy, but the fact that the Games has never been held in South America could count in Rio&apos;s favour, while Tokyo could suffer due to the proximity to last year&apos;s Beijing Games and the prospect of a third European Olympics in row could hurt Madrid&apos;s chances. Reedie said: &quot;This is a very, very close race between four outstanding bids, and because the bids are so good and because it is so close the last few hours are going to be even more exciting than usual.&quot; Rio&apos;s convincing message of using the Games to turbo-charge the development of a continent and bring the Games to new audiences remains compelling, but Obama&apos;s late intervention has changed the game. Much will depend on whether his much vaunted rhetorical powers can seal the deal. The lessons of London There many be growing questions over the legacy that London has promised from the 2012 Games, but one lasting influence is undeniable. London&apos;s victory in Singapore in 2005 in many ways rewrote the rules of successful Olympic bidding. It was the first race under new IOC rules designed to draw a line under the Salt Lake City scandal, which led to 10 IOC members being expelled. However hard it will ultimately prove to deliver, Seb Coe&apos;s promise to deliver a legacy for the world&apos;s youth, regenerate one of the poorest parts of east London and deliver a Games devoid of white elephants went down well with IOC members aware that the movement needed to reach out to new audiences. A perfectly pitched film establishing London&apos;s multicultural credentials also left a warm glow. The role played by then prime minister Tony Blair in Singapore has also been noted by the bidders for 2016. His decision to travel to Singapore and spend two days lobbying IOC members one-one in his hotel suite was widely seen as a vital factor. Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett met with Blair last week to solicit his advice on negotiating the IOC voting process. Since the Salt Lake City scandal led to IOC members being banned from visting prospective host cities, their marketing and lobbying campaigns have become increasingly sophisticated. The bidding race has become an exercise in remaining just the right side of the rules while trying to gain every possible incremental advantage over your opponents. Sentiment counts for a lot. Although Tokyo has a solid bid that ticks all the boxes and is perhaps the most financially solid of all four contenders, its lack of a compelling backstory and perceived lack of support at home could count against it. Buzzwords such as legacy and sustainability have become de rigeur and, with the IOC placing a premium on ensuring the Games reaches a new generation and expands into new markets, the youth-appeal that worked so decisively in London&apos;s favour is also seen as a key factor. In light of the recession, Rogge has said the IOC &quot;is in the mode for lean Games&quot;, putting the emphasis on reusable venues and lofty legacy goals."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/02/olympic-games-2016-host-city-decision-live", "sentences": ["The London 2012 contingent, including Seb Coe, were spotted reminiscing about Singapore four years ago and feeling a lot more relaxed now than they did then."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T06:28:29Z", "title": "Olympic Games 2016 host city decision day - as it happened!", "tags": ["Rio 2016", "Sport", "US news", "Spain", "Brazil", "Japan", "World news", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "article": " It&apos;s an exciting day in Copenhagen as the celebrities supporting the four candidate cities touch down for the final push. The IOC delegates cast their votes later today, with a decision expected around 5.30pm.  Barney Ronay will be commenting live on all the days events plus we&apos;ll have updates from Owen Gibson in Copenhagen as well. There&apos;s still time to cast your vote for which city should win in our poll. Read all about the background to the bids in Owen&apos;s report from Copenhagen, as he delves into the politics behind each candidate&apos;s entry and in particular Barack Obama&apos;s backing for Chicago.  Plus here&apos;s the lowdown on the strengths and weaknesses of each bid: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo.  7.45am Hello and welcome. Even as I type Chicago&apos;s presentation has just kicked off. This is history in the making. This is huge. this is also a video of a man singing some bluesy music that sounds a bit like the them tune from The Wire over shots of happy smiling non-broke or unemployed Americans. Go Chi!  7.50am Owen Gibson is in Copenhagen with his finger literally on the beating pulse of world sport. He sends this update from the epicentre:   things got underway last night with a day of frantic press conferences as all the rival bidders tried desperately to combat the fact their final push had been comprehensively overshadowed by the leader of the free world turning up today to bat for his former home city. Tokyo had a robot, nice uniforms and the air of the already defeated, Madrid had nice red, the prime minister and bullish optimism while Rio had Pele and President Lula, who - as president of the country on track to be the fifth largest economy on earth and a vocal advocate of Rio&apos;s cause throughout two years of presentations, IOC visits, press calls and PR - must be feeling a bit put out that Obama has swooped in to steal his thunder.   7.58am So Chicago currently burbling on about how it hopes to be considered as good as Hackney at presenting a major global event. A man is now talking at a lectern while we see a video of inspiring pictures of stuff happening in Chicago. &quot;If you award us the games, we will be your best partners. The people of Chicago are passionate honest and hard-working.&quot;Really? All of them?  8.01am Oh no! It&apos;s children saying weepy heartfelt things about Chicago. &quot;The heart of America!&quot; Oh no, they&apos;re singing. Stirring music is playing. &quot;Chicago brings people together!&quot; Children are doing brave things in classrooms.  8.08am There&apos;s a kind of chatshow style Q&amp;A going on now involving a US decathlete and a nice smiley woman. They;re called Brian and Linda. A man called Doug Arnott comes on. He&apos;s billed as &quot;the architect of our Games plan&quot;. Now he&apos;s doing a speech in weirdly accented French. Oh good. He&apos;s stopped and become American again. &quot;Our goal was to build venues that support both elite sport and youth sport.&quot; Good idea. Someone get on the blower to London 2012.  8.15am Doug Arnott: &quot;Concrete and steel do not build sport. People build sport.&quot; Which is probably right. Unless you&apos;re playing concreteball. More from Owen Gibson in the hub:  At last night&apos;s gala opening, featuring - of course - equestrianism reinterpreted through the medium of dance and a specially composed song called &quot;Plant a Tree&quot;, it was clear that it was the Oprah and Michelle show that was captivating the normally reserved IOC members - all protocol abandoned as camera phones were proffered and a mini scrum developed in the normally refined environs of the Copenhagen Opera House. The London 2012 contingent, including Seb Coe, were spotted reminiscing about Singapore four years ago and feeling a lot more relaxed now than they did then. However, there were reports that Winfrey might have lost a few votes by making IOC members&apos; wives wait for the lift at the Marriott Hotel where all the IOC members are staying and furious lobbying has been taking place over the last few days.    8.16am &quot;And now, here&apos;s someone familair to me and you - Bob Ctvrtlik!&quot;  8.17am Bob Ctvrtlik is talking about development and corporate partnerships. Eric E Schmidt from Goggle pops up with a message of support. He looks like a really well-groomed super-nerd and is probably worth at least $3646454bn. Quick shot of Obama looking interested.  8.20am &quot;Sports has given me so much! Like confidence!&quot; More happy teenagers with huge shiny white teeth. And this just in from Seb Coe on the wires: &quot;Any one of these four cities could deliver a great Olympics - this is probably the highest quality contest there has been. It is very close competition and it could all be decided by the final presentations.&quot;There you have it. It&apos;s all up for grabs.  8.25am Wow! It&apos;s Michelle Obama. &quot;I was born and raised on Chicago&apos;s south-side,&quot; she starts off. She looks great, as ever, in a kind of shiny yellow suit and with truly enormous TV hair. Never mind him, she is absolutely great. She&apos;s talking about cheering on Carl Lewis when she was a kid. Me too, Michelle, me too.  8.28am This is easy for the First Lady, she&apos;s talking about the Chicago she knows. &quot;I&apos;m not asking just as the First Lady of the United States, and not just as a Chicagean, and not just as a mother... I&apos;m asking as a daughter. You see, my dad would have been so proud&quot;. Michelle&apos;s dad had multiple sclerosis. &quot;He taught me to throw a mean right hook&quot;. Not a dry eye in the house. &quot;My dad was my hero!&quot; Blimey. What a show-stopper.  8.30am Michelle is absolutely ripping it up. She seems genuinely moved by all this, much more so than all the Dougs and Berts and Daves. She&apos;s introducing &quot;my husband, the President of the United States&quot;. He&apos;s up.  8.31am President Obama is now speaking. &quot;America is ready and eager to assume that sacred trust. We&apos;re a nation that has always opened its arms to the world. Including my father...&quot; More fathers.  8.32am &quot;On those Chicago streets I worked alongside folks of every colour and nationality... each is part of our city, one city, a place where I found a home&quot; I want to live in Chicago. With Michelle Obama. &quot;The World Cup we hosted in the 90s - we know how to put on big events.&quot; Really glad he didn&apos;t use the word &quot;soccer&quot; there.  8.35am Obama&apos;s breezing through this, lots of stuff about the American dream and we can make it if we try and moments in history and fates of nations. It&apos;s like a really stirring music hall song. He is doing a political speech now. This bit&apos;s kind of about him and &quot;why I ran for president&quot; rather than which city the pole vault should happen in.  8.36am The concept of the Olympic Movement was originally supposed to be supra-political, something that related sport to the greater good. Politicians have been trying to hijak it ever since. Here&apos;s another one borrowing its imagery and its phrases.  8.38am Obama wants to &quot;welcome the world &quot;into my neighborhood&quot;  8.39am He ends a little weakly with &quot;the city of Chicago and America will make the world proud&quot; and just sort of walks off. Questions from the IOC members now.  8.40am Sergei Bubka is asking a question! Go Sergei! It&apos;s about the Olympic village and the cycling annexe. Will it be as high spec as the main village? Get in there Sergei, stick your bendy pole in.  8.44am Chicago is currently reassuring Sergei Bubka. Some insight from Owen in Copenhagen:   there is a bit of history between the US and the IOC - Atlanta was a bit of a disaster and there have been a series of disputes over how TV revenues are shared. hence lots of references to what Chicago can do for the Olympic movement. There has been a lot of talk about how chicago will adopt a humble approach - reconnecting America with the world and supporting the Olympic movement and the presentation seems to be following that approach. But the odd reference to to sponsorship revenues betrays one of the key reasons why chicago is favourite - in uncertain economic times, it offers a windfall in sponsorship and TV income.    8.47am Doug Arnott, Chicago bid vice president reassures Bubka that it&apos;s easy to get around the Olympic village site. He keeps calling him &quot;Mr Boobka&quot;.  8.46am &quot;The next question is from Prince Albert&quot;. Let&apos;s hope it&apos;s a piercing one then. But ultimately pleasurable.  8.48am Actually it&apos;s about &quot;the legacy&quot; of a Chicago Games. Bob Ctvrtlik says Chicago will &quot;put the fun back into the Games&quot; by doing stuff in parks. Is fun really a legacy? How long does fun last? Anyway, Boris has already sold the London games on the issue of having fun and making it more like a garden party.  8.50am Having fun. Transl: &quot;not spending as much as China but still somehow pulling it off on the cheap.&quot;  8.53am A question from one Professor Lundqvist about doping. Chicago says it will try to stop doping happen and co operate with everyone blah blah. Imagine them saying anything else.  8.55am Barack answers a question about the travel infrastructure supporting all the visitors. &quot;America is at its best when it&apos;s open to the world.... Chicago, we&apos;ve got everybody, this could be a meeting in Chicago, we look like the world!... We are linked to the world.&quot; He gets some applause, but there&apos;s no doubt he&apos;s better with an autocue. That was a bit like a first draught of an advert for McDonalds or a new and extra friendly brand of chewing gum.  8.58am For some reason Obama has just been presented with a framed picture. And now the Chicago team are all off to scattered applause. They&apos;ve done their worst and Obama did his bit very nicely. for what it&apos;s worth I suspect that he&apos;s going to swing it. How can you say no to all that star power. He&apos;s a very good presenter too. Would be a terrible snub now if Chicago dont get it.  8.59am And after the Lord Mayor&apos;s show, here&apos;s a quiz about football in the Olympics.  9.02am American TV are harping on about the applause Obama got for his bits, pointing out that applauding an Olympic bid presentation is quite unusual. But then, so is a US president turing up and talking about America opening its doors to the world. To be honest the applause sounded a bit forced and embarrassed. What are you supposed to do when he&apos;s talking like that?  9.04am Tokyo are next up by the way. Tough act to follow, but they are a decent safe bet.  9.14am Apparently the IOC lot have all swarmed around the Obamas to shoot the breeze and bathe in their star heat. There&apos;s a bit of a a suggestion going around that Chicago have a been appealing directly to the African and Caribbean block. Obama flagged up his Kenyan father in his speech. It&apos;s a bit like a global election campaign for him, he&apos;s talked in exactly the same way.  9.20am Oprah Winfrey is also &quot;working the floor&quot;. Can that be right? We&apos;re about to have a press conference with all the Chi lot, including the Obamas. They&apos;re sitting next to each other. Sweet. And more The Wire-style music to introduce them.  9.23am Actually, the Obamas aren&apos;t in it. they&apos;ve shuffled off somewhere else. Probably for the best with all those hard-nosed sports hacks in the room.  9.26am The first question is about the Pres and his &quot;message to the world&quot;. He&apos;s kind of taken over all this and he&apos;s not even here now. I wonder if it&apos;s at all annoying for the bid team to work like maniacs on this, the moment of their careers, and then have to talk about Johnny-come-lately glory-hunter Obama the whole time.  9.28am The Mayor of Chicago is talking about &quot;a bedder life not juss for our chilrun but for all chilrun&quot;  9.30am You can tell Chicago feel they nailed it - and it was a good presentation. Americans are excellent at this kind of thing. It was showbiz and Oprah and TV and played the big emotional chords. But is that kind of thing really going to work with the IOC?  9.32am Meanwhile Tokyo&apos;s presentation is kicking off. They&apos;re fighting back with their new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama.  9.35am And they&apos;re kicking off with Hatoyama on the opening leg. He seems fairly youthful and slick, a bit like a Japanese David Cameron. He&apos;s only been in the job for two weeks. He mentions &quot;the heartfelt wish of the people of Japan to host the Games in Tokyo&quot;. He&apos;s talking about the body and soul and his personal philosophy.  9.38am But... the last Games were in Asia. Are we really going to have a Japanese Olympics after a Chinese Olympics, with just London in between? I bet we don&apos;t. Sorry Yukio, much as I like your promises on greenhouse emissions, which for some reason he&apos;s going on about now. The elections are over. You won. Now say something that appeals to Sergei Bubka.  9.41am He&apos;s pitching it as a green urban bid. There&apos;s a lot of stuff about nature and man in harmony. He&apos;s also given a government guarantee for all the funding. Bit unfair really as he&apos;s talking in a foreign language, but this is no swinging Obama presentation.  9.43am The Tokyo video has got lots of pictures of healthy Japanese people and Japanese athletes. There&apos;s a bloke hurling the hammer and going &quot;aaaaaarrrrgh!&quot; Tokyo is probably a safe bet, a kind of Toyota Olympics with it&apos;s emphasis on being &quot;compact&quot; and green and economical, like a slightly dull brand new Prius.  9.48am The Tokyo promo film has some great moody sax in it. Da da dee, dum dum. It&apos;s an inspiring tale of ordinary people doing sport, even though they&apos;re also waitresses and schoolkids. A nine year old does judo and she looks a bit tasty too. Neat and stylish young people smile. A florist runs over a bridge. A cook does the pommel horse. I hope he&apos;s washed his hands.  9.52am Ichiro Kuno, president of the Tokyo bid is up, and he&apos;s sucking up to Jacques Rogge straight away. &quot;You have encouraged us!&quot; Then he says &quot;Japanese people are not good at showing our emotions&quot; and you kind of want to give him a cuddle. He&apos;s emphasising that the money is all sorted, which was one of their problems. The government now seems to be fully backing the bid.  9.55am Now he&apos;s showing off by speaking French with a strong Japanese accent. It&apos;s weird but not bad. Very likable, Mr Kuno. &quot;Japan&apos;s strong point - teamwahhk!&quot; he says with a flourish. And here comes the rest of his team, the women in very nice matching blazers with varsity style badges on them.  9.58am The first tokyo woman seems to excited she&apos;s almost completely out of control. &quot;We have access to THE PACIFIC OCEAN!&quot; &quot;If you have never tried karaoke then WE... WILL... TAKE YOU!!!&quot; No kidding. I want to go, too. Let&apos;s go and do karaoke. She reminded me slightly of Su pollard as a yellow coat in an early episode of Hi De Hi.  10.01am Oh dear. the next Tokyo bloke really can&apos;t speak English that well. It&apos;s not really fair this, but his accent is massively distracting. &quot;The important thing is to CHALLENGE... YOUR... OWN... LIMITS!!!&quot; He ends with a weird bit of visualisation about &quot;a cheering crowd&quot; and then yells like a nutcase &quot;INTOKYO2016!!!!&quot;.  10.03am They do have two paralympic representatives on stage, the bloke with the bad accent, who is blind, and a woman in a wheelchair. I don&apos;t think Chicago had such a strong presence.  10.06am I rather like the Tokyo lot. they&apos;ve got a synchronised swimmer up now, a former gold medalist apparently. She seems nice. And she can probably stand upside down in a swimming pool waggling her legs about too. &quot;It is... our... TOKYO!!&quot; she ends. They all seem to have had the same media training, based around yelling a lot at the end.  10.07am They&apos;re doing another film, this one about how easy it is to get around Tokyo and how clean everything is. They&apos;ve got electric taxis, bullet trains and tasty raw fish. I want to go to Tokyo. They&apos;ve even mocked up a happy, clean, non-drunk or fat crowd going into the Olympic stadium looking sleek and calm.  10.09am &quot;President Logge, delegates...&quot;  10.10am A dissenting voice. Or at least, a voice. Stephen spencer says:   like most residents of Tokyo I&apos;m praying that the city doesn&apos;t win. The bid is the brainchild of the notorious egomaniac Shintaro Ishihara, governor of this fair concrete megalopolis**... Let&apos;s go Rio, Madrid or Chicago! We want to watch it at home on the telly and have our tax dosh spent on something useful.  **note: very interesting but potentially libelous bits edited out.  10.11am Some manga-style comic images. Like it. And a child doing lots of backflips in a kind of urban slum. Shun-Ichiro Okano is back and he&apos;s giving his final summing up.  10.15am They&apos;re doing a final sucking up to &quot;the Olympic movement&quot; and thanking everyone. And now they&apos;re off and its questions from the IOC members.  10.17am Prof Lundquist is back asking about doping again. It&apos;s the same question he asked Chicago. Will you help in the fight against drugs? The answer, amazingly, is yes we will.  10.19am Prince Albert is back with more piercing insights. He&apos;s asking about the Olympic village again. Kono tells him it&apos;s all in hand. He says &quot;the most important thing for us is a legacy that lives in the heart&quot;. Like a fried cheese sandwich.  10.23am Kono promises &quot;no smell from the fish market&quot;. Not sure what he&apos;s on about, but it sounds like good news. Is that a metaphor for something? The Olympic diploma is handed over again, a big piece of paper in a picture frame, and they&apos;re off.  10.24am On the Tokyo Mayor chappie John Senior writes: &quot;It&apos;s a shame Governor Ishihara didn&apos;t do the presentation. He may be a gaffe-prone ultranationalist (think a green Silvio Berlusconi), but he&apos;d certainly have grabbed people&apos;s attention. Today he declared that 2016 could be the last ever Olympics before mankind destroys the planet (unless, he presumably meant, Tokyo wins).&quot;  10.26am Next up on the stage is Rio. Looking at your comments there seems to be some support for a first South American Games. I have to admit I&apos;d love Rio to get it. What a brilliant place it is. That really would be an Olympic Games.  10.30am A bit of a kerfuffle in Copenhagen. This on the wires:  Police say they have detained 43 people in the Danish capital for public disturbance, some trying to hang a banner on a building along the route that President Barack Obama took to attend an IOC meeting  Apparently it&apos;s Greenpeace people trying to hang some painted sheets up. Leave them alone for heaven&apos;s sake. What is the point?  10.34am But yes, a Rio Olympics. Wouldn&apos;t that be something? Maybe they&apos;d finally do the Maracana up. The last time I went there Vasco da Gama were playing Flamengo and there were about 3,000 people in the far distance waving flags in the middle of a horrible crumbling concrete bowl and shouting &quot;&apos;Meennngo!&quot;. It is absolutely huge. But you could fill in the moat and make it a running track. This was about 15 years ago by the way, so apologies if it&apos;s been fixed up since.  10.38am American TV is still going on about the fact that people gave the Obamas a good reception. They seem genuinely stunned by it. Maybe America just isn&apos;t used to being liked on the world stage after all those Bush years. But they&apos;re also very smug about their &quot;star power&quot;. &quot;Chicago knew it had to bring its A-game,&quot; the bloke on ABC says. Get out of it.            10.41am: Mr and Mrs Obama take to the stage in Copenhagen to push Chicago&apos;s case.  10.45am The view seems to be that Chicago are now favourites after their presentation, but solely on the back of the Obama stardust. It was a bit gloomy and downbeat apart from them (or her). Maybe Rio can blow them out of the water with a bit more fun and pizazz and enthusiasm. The odd jewelled bikini.  10.56am Well, this is getting exciting now. It feels as though the next presentation could be decisive with Chicago and Rio facing off as the narrow favourites. Don&apos;t blow it Brazil. And for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t let Pele have the mic. On the wires:&quot;Barack Obama launched an emotional appeal today to the International Olympic Committee to choose his home city Chicago to host the 2016 Games. Chicago and Rio de Janeiro are viewed as favourites to win the contest ahead of Madrid and Tokyo.&quot;It wasn&apos;t actually that emotional. But he did a job.  11.00am Five minutes to go until the Rio bid get on the stage. Let&apos;s play bid bingo. My suggestions: &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot;; &quot;strong security&quot;, &quot;in the shadow of the Sugarloaf&quot;, &quot;one big beach party&quot;, &quot;samba-style&quot;, er... &quot;girl from Ipanema&quot;. Something about the rainforest and the environment.  11.04am Incidentally &quot;tasty&quot;, here in London, means &quot;good at fighting&quot; among the Guy Ritchie-style mock-geezer community. So wash your minds out with caustic soda  11.05am Owen Gibson is of course as we speak crawling through the pulsing arteries at the very heart of world sport. Here&apos;s his latest bulletin from inside the beast.  11.12am Carlos Arthur Nuzman is kicking things off for Rio, addressing Rogge and his friends in a lilting Brazilian-accented French. Before him we had a brief address from Joao Havelange, also in French. Very austere so far.  11.15am Nuzman is talking about confidence and the new economy and the youth of the world. &quot;Brazil is uniquely placed,&quot; he says in a cute Brazilian accent. Well, it&apos;s in south America for a start. Some shots of the Sugarloaf, beaches, young people, lots of glad-handing Brazilian politicians who, as ever, look like total comedians and good-time boys.  11.17am This just in from Owen, bid-side: &quot;view in the press centre seems to broadly accord with US TV - chicago presentation pretty flat before michelle stood up to speak, but she might have done the job for them. much depends on how rio can respond - it&apos;s a long day and the Obamas emotional impact may have dulled by the time they come to vote.&quot;  11.20am The best film yet with some lovely jazzy music and great pics of Rio and Cariocas doing watersports and dancing. It&apos;s all gone carnival down there. Trumpets, bongos, twiddly guitars, and a nice croony voice over the top with fireworks and carnival shots.  11.21am So far so good for Rio. It&apos;s all a lot more lively and colourful than the Chicago one, which, even when Meesh and Barack were on was quite sombre and quietly hectoring. They&apos;re concentrating on the economic side right now and promising &quot;safe and secure Games, the climax of decades of investment&quot;. This is what they need to work on.  11.25am Henrique Merlielles is up, the governor of the Brazilian central bank. It&apos;s slightly humiliating that Brazil has to do this, but there you go. The place was a basket case with rampant inflation just 15 years ago. He&apos;s talking up the current situation and the $420bn they&apos;re pouring into Rio&apos;s development.  11.26am Mac Millings notes: &quot;I like the photo. It makes it look like Chicago are planning to hold the Olympics in an enormous, Truman Show-style space age bubble. I suppose that would be to protect the Spirit of the Games from Chicagoan corruption. Although I may have that the wrong way round.&quot;  11.28am The bank governor is boasting about Brazil&apos;s recent oil find now. He walks off and gets a lovely backslap from Eduardo Paes, mayor of Rio. It made a loud &quot;flop&quot; noise. And there it is, first shot of Christ the Redeemer as Paes talks fluently about the World Cup coming and economies of scale.  11.30am Brazil is going really big on legacy and economy, presumably knowing they&apos;ve already got fun and glitz and the underdog vote in the bag. Let&apos;s hope they don&apos;t forget their strengths as well. But also that they don&apos;t let Pele say anything.  11.34am Wow! The Rio Games site looks absolutely amazing. The village and the stadia are right on the seafront. I want to live there and play beach football with Jairzinho every day. Then we can go for a caipirinha in a beach front cafe and maybe go to a jazz club and have a really great time. Every day. Maybe I&apos;ll start to wear gold jewelry and a white linen suit. Even the BMX park looks brilliant and verdant. Brazil does tropical gardens really well.  11.36am They have got to give it to Rio. It&apos;s a major re-development opportunity for them. The whole place is being made over and done up, and let&apos;s face it, it could do with it. &quot;Rio 2016 will help chance the face of Rio,&quot; they say. And you really believe them.  11.37am Disclaimer: other Olympic bid cities are also available. I am really biased.  11.39am Isabel Swan, a Brazilian athlete, is up now. She&apos;s great too. Brilliant. She&apos;s got Pele on his feet waving at the crowd too, which is fine, just don&apos;t let him speak. This Swan is speaking very well here, presenting it all very clearly, at least as good as an Obama.  11.40am Swan, who is great, introduces &quot;our great leader&quot;, the bearded President Lula. He gives her a lingering bear hug. Steady.  11.44am Lula seems to be wearing a Blue Peter badge. And he&apos;s already mentioned &quot;the golden sands of Copacabana Beach&quot;. &quot;We are a people who give meaning to the term &quot;melting pot&quot;. It is at the core of our identity&quot;. Take that Barack! &quot;Among the top ten economies in the world, Brazil is the only one who has never hosted a Games.&quot; Case closed, surely. &quot;This is not a Games for Brazil, this is a Games for South America&quot;.  11.47am Lula is nailing it. He&apos;s pushing all the buttons about the inclusivity of the Olympic movement and sending a message to the world. The logic is overwhelming. And he&apos;s stressing that they&apos;ve got the finance all in place. &quot;Dear friends, Brazil is experiencing an excellent moment...&quot; He is doing very well.  11.50am &quot;Rio is ready... give us this chance and you will not regret it. Be sure, the Games we will deliver in Rio will be unforgettable. They will be full of the passion, the energy and thew creativity of the Brazilian people&quot; Exit to what sounds like much louder applause than either of the Obamas got. Really well done, that. Lula did the job. Now, if they can just keep Pele quiet...  11.52am Another film. Very multicultural this one. There&apos;s a bloke in a bedouin style head dress talking in Portuguese. and a Nigerian-looking bloke. And then a really nice shot of those golden sands with the Olympic rings on them. Very pretty indeed.  11.55am Rio just needs a a big finish here and it&apos;s done. They can only blow it from here. The bid president is talking about &quot;universal celebrations of sport&quot; and how &quot;the last two years have been the greatest of my life&quot;. All the bids have had this bit where they seem to be just talking to the IOC lot directly. It&apos;s a bit odd.  11.58am &quot;When you push the button today you have the chance to inspire a continent. Vote Rio and we open a gateway to 180 million passionate young people in south America.&quot; That&apos;s the way to do it. None of that weird Tokyo shouting about karaoke. Very good summing up.  11.59am Question time again. Will Prince Albert come chinking up again?  12.00pm Crickey it&apos;s Prof Lundqvist again with his doping stuff. He&apos;s there to ask everyone about access to athletes. And Prince Albert is dramatically increasing his pleasure by asking about legacy again.  12.02pm Nuzman of Brazil is providing the reassurances on doping. Grant Cartledge wants to know: &quot;...did Pele say anything? And if he did, was it about...?&quot; Well, you know. Those ads. No, no Pele yet. And it looks like they&apos;ve got away with it. He won&apos;t be able to get in now. Just questions. ,  12.05pm The only iffy thing about the Rio bid seems to be all this stuff about cruise ships docking in the port to provide accommodation, as they do for carnival. It just sounds a bit irregular somehow. Paes is desperately trying to make it sound completely normal that people are going to have to stay on ships and not in hotels. Quick. Gloss over it and get on to something else.  12.08pm Just in case you&apos;re into that kind of thing, here&apos;s a bit about Tokyo&apos;s eco stadium.  12.10pm Lula&apos;s answering a question about the delivery of the whole thing. He&apos;s defending Brazil&apos;s right to call itself a developed nation these days and to carry out this kind of global project. &quot;It is a wish of the Brazilian people&quot; he says. He looks quite impassioned about it too.  12.15pm Rio gets its framed diploma. Nuzman and a 17-year-old athlete pick it up. She&apos;s been in tears pretty much all morning so Nuzman gives her a hug. And that&apos;s it for Rio - and for me too. Thanks for reading and thanks for your emails. Simon Burnton will be picking up the rest of the action when he&apos;s come back from getting a medicinal Diet Coke.  12.30pm Hello world! Madrid are up next, but not until 1.45pm UK time. Until then, or just before then, it&apos;s not that I&apos;m not excited and stuff but I&apos;m going to be mainly doing other things. I still love you really.       1.00pm To get to know a place, it&apos;s always good to find out what kind of music the people there are into. So here&apos;s current Spanish No1 smash single Esclavo De Sus Besos by David Bisbal! And here&apos;s the title track from Fito y Fitipaldis&apos; current chart-topping album Antes de que cuente Diez! And before you get all don&apos;t-they-have-rubbish-taste on me, here&apos;s our own No1, embedded in a use-friendly widget. OK, ours is cooler.       1.10pm And, while I&apos;m on the subject, here&apos;s the US No1 by the Black Eyed Peas. Everyone else here at Guardian HQ seems to be working diligently. Me, I&apos;ve got a big pair of headphones on and I&apos;m having a little private dance party. With fairly cheesy music.  1.45pm I have to admit to being a bit bemused by the odds on this race. For one thing, Rio isn&apos;t the favourite. For another, Madrid isn&apos;t the outsider. With London hosting in 2012, surely another western European city has absolutely no chance at all? Surely the Spaniards are the Eric Moussambanis of this particular race? ie, they&apos;ve got no chance at all and, though they might give us all a bit of fun along the way, are just wasting everybody&apos;s time? Surely?  1.46pm The delegates have been told to take their seats. Madrid-based action coming up.  1.49pm The Madrid delegation have filed into the room. This isn&apos;t the most interesting minute to be writing a minute-by-minute update on, to be honest. But I can reveal that their bid&apos;s token football star is ... Raul! Not bad, but Rio had Pele.  1.52pm The only emails I&apos;ve had in the last 10 minutes both came from the BBC&apos;s press office and we telling me about a sequel to Winnie the Pooh, read by Bernard Cribbins. If you work for a press office anywhere, let me know what you&apos;d like me to tell the world about and I&apos;ll do my best.  1.55pm Early Madrid catchphrases: &quot;We can spread the magic!&quot; and &quot;Individuals not infrastructure!&quot;  1.58pm Oooh, a video! People of different nationalities are arguing about who is the most Madrid-like. &quot;The Italians are the most Madrilenians \u2013 we love art as much as they do.&quot; &quot;No, the most Madrilenians are us the Chinese, that strength, that hope, binds us together.&quot; They&apos;re all extremely, er, Madrilenians, though, because they all speak perfect Spanish.  2.00pm A former Olympic hockey champion is introducing Madrid&apos;s &quot;legacy plan&quot;. &quot;We believe in our games with a human touch,&quot; she says. &quot;Looking at them the funny thing is that [prime minister] Zapatero is socialist and Esperanza Aguirre and Gallardon who are the mayor and president of Madrid are conservative,&quot; writes Ian Pinhey. &quot;So Aguirre and Gallardon hate Zapatero but also hate each other! There have been accusations of Aguirre spying on Gallardon recently.&quot;  2.02pm Oooh, a video! They&apos;ve got a venue called The Magic Box. What&apos;s not to like about that?  2.07pm Beatriz Quir\u00f3s Mancebo, a Madrilenian living in London, has got on the line. &quot;Today it should be our day! We deserve it,&quot; she writes. &quot;I know Chicago &amp; Rio are the favourites, but I don&apos;t think none of them have all the Population support &amp; enthusiasm that we have!&quot; \u2013 it&apos;s true, Madrid had 86% popular support for its bid, the best rating of all the bidding cities \u2013 &quot;We need the chance to show to the World how wonderful city Madrid is ... and for sure organisation is going to be great (just remind you the successs in Barcelona 1992). Come on Madrid! YES, WE CAN!&quot; Madrid also appears to have just promised hotel rooms in 2016 at &quot;guaranteed 2009 prices&quot;.  2.09pm If Madrid really wanted to impress me, they&apos;d have hired a Spanish-English translator who&apos;s a little bit more inspiring than this one. I&apos;m sure she&apos;d brilliant at translating and everything, but she is not getting across Esperanza Aguirre&apos;s inspirational oratory skills.      Disappointed Paris 2012 Olympic bid supporters file away after finding out that London had won the Games instead. Photograph: Srdjan Suki/EPA    2.11pm Gary Naylor has emailed! &quot;Rather like the Eurovision Song Contest, the winners of The Games tend to look one-dimensionally elated, but the losers look rather more interesting. Can we have a Guardian gallery of the losers as they discover their fate? I love the looks of anger, jealousy, bitterness, blame, befuddlement, disappointment, resignation etc etc etc as their fate is made known. The Parisian delegation and assembled masses in 2005 were superbly expressive.&quot; Er, no. But you might like this.  2.18pm Oooh, a video! This time, they are bringing a buff A4 envelope by hand from Madrid to Copenhagen, via lots of other places. And here it is, in the hall itself! It&apos;s a letter from Madrid to all of you, out there. And not a very long one either. They&apos;ve offered us their work, and also their friendship. &quot;Together we can dream and we can suffer,&quot; they say. Well you can suffer by yourself, if you don&apos;t mind. We can dream together though, if you like.  2.22pm Alejandro Blanco, president of the Spanish Olympic Association, is on the mic. &quot;We will reduce travel times!&quot; he pledges. &quot;What do we want? We want success!&quot; Hell, yeah!  2.23pm &quot;We believe that Madrid offers an inspirational organisation, a festival for all the Olympic family,&quot; Blanco continues, &quot;allowing them to realise their potential, to be happy and enjoy the games \u2013 the games with a human touch!&quot;  2.28pm Raul&apos;s talking. &quot;Hola everyone!&quot; Next to him is a young girl, the future of Spanish athletics apparently, who is very clearly extremely scared. &quot;I believe, we believe,&quot; he concludes. As does the Paralympian who speaks next. And the young girl, who speaks excellently well in English and is rewarded with a kiss from Raul.  2.30pm Oooh, a video! And Madrid introduce flamenco music to their presentation for the first time. A little overdue if you ask me. It accompanies images of Spanish sporting achievement and celebration. Quite a good video, actually.  2.34pm 89-year-old Juan Antonio Samaranch, former IOC president, basically asks the IOC to give Spain the Olympics as a personal favour to him, because he&apos;s going to die soon. And Ed Brown emails to remind us about the photograph members of the Spanish basketball team made before going to Beijing. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to nay-say the city of Madrid \u2013 it&apos;s nice \u2013 but frankly in my opinion the Spanish don&apos;t deserve to host an Olympics any time soon.&quot; Ah, but you forgot this.  2.35pm It&apos;s only the ruddy king! He promises that &quot;a vote for Madrid ... will lead to more friendship&quot; and says that &quot;the world will be a better place to live following Madrid 2016&quot;. Crikey, these are big promises.  2.38pm Ooooh, a video! A bit arty this one. I&apos;m not sure what it&apos;s about. People are saying verbs in the past tense. &quot;I stayed&quot;, &quot;I jumped&quot;, &quot;I suffered&quot;, that kind of stuff. Fernando Torres pops up. &quot;I showed off,&quot; he says. Rafael Nadal&apos;s there too! &quot;I saw,&quot; he tells us. OK then. And that&apos;s the end of Madrid&apos;s presentation. 5/10 for in-hall applause, I&apos;d say.  2.40pm Questions from the floor begin, as seems traditional, with some chap from Sweden asking about anti-doping. &quot;Madridlians are best known for the &apos;chuleria&apos; (pretentious behaviour),&quot; writes Xixa. &quot;I think Rio will offer a much better show and give the oportunity to south America, Spain had Barcelona. It&apos;s mad they should get it.&quot;  2.41pm Prince Albert has asked some questions. He very much likes asking questions. And Gintare has dropped us a line to disagree with Xixa. &quot;Two years ago I spent five months in Madrid on an Erasmus programme, and it is definitely the friendliest place I have ever spent time in,&quot; she says. &quot;The Madrile\u00f1os love their city, and love the fact that people come to see it. I was treated like a princess all the time. If there is one thing that Madrid deserves to host the Olympics for it is definitely that &apos;human touch&apos; they have been talking about.&quot; So there you are. No chuleria at all.  2.43pm Oh dear. &quot;After that presentation by Madrid I am afraid it must go to Rio or Tokyo,&quot; writes Richard Young. &quot;I have long believed Rio would win as that is the way the IOC thinks. Rio certianly have pushed their buttons. I stayed with the Madrid bid team in Beijing and found them then to be as inhospitable as they appear on stage now. It is all fakery!&quot; Crikey.  2.45pm &quot;The Olympic decision must rival the Champions League draw for manufactured &apos;tension&apos;,&quot; writes Kieran. Who would like me to mention that &quot;Mad&quot; Frankie Fraser is going to be speaking at the Devonshire Hotel in Liverpool on 16 October. The Madrid team are explaining that they have &quot;used the hand of our logo to create a legacy for each finger&quot;. They mean that there would be five strands to their legacy \u2013 cultural, environmental, economic, that kind of thing \u2013 not that, for example, the logo&apos;s little finger would get a legacy all of its own.  2.48pm Sergei Bubka has asked a question about sailing. Sergei Bubka is the greatest pole vaulter in the history of humanity. You don&apos;t really expect him to be bothering with sailing.  2.50pm That is the end of the Madrid presentation. The team receive their special commemorative IOC diploma. They look like a nice bunch really. Maybe they&apos;ll get the 2020 games, eh, because they&apos;ve got a bogglingly small chance of getting this one.  2.53pm &quot;This is not the end of proceedings, by far,&quot; warns Jacques Rogge to delegates traipsing out of the room. We&apos;re about to start voting. But not before someone presents a report into something or other.  2.58pm &quot;The four cities and their projects perfectly embody the Olympic spirit,&quot; the report says. Well that&apos;s a relief.  3.01pm &quot;We leave it to you, dear colleagues, to reflect upon each project,&quot; says the chair of the 2016 evaluation commission. What she means is, it&apos;s time to vote.  3.04pm First, they open the floor to questions. Inevitably, that bloke from Sweden pipes up to witter on about doping. He considers the evaluation commisson&apos;s report to have been &quot;too vague&quot; on this issue. Which is why he&apos;s had to ask all these questions. Rogge asks him to &quot;draft a little note&quot;.  3.05pm Another question, from the Prince of Orange. Where&apos;s Orange? Do they really have a monarchy? Why do we only get the prince? Is the King of Orange otherwise engaged? All these questions rush to my mind in such a giddy whoosh that I take absolutely no notice of his own. Sorry.  3.10pm &quot;Spanish TV seems to think they got it in the bag,&quot; reports Alasdair Barratt. &quot;In fact if it weren&apos;t for your coverage, I&apos;d think they were the only candidate city.&quot; They&apos;re going to have a very bad afternoon, then, that&apos;s my prediction. They&apos;re now having a coffee break and will be returning \u2013 as will I \u2013 at 3.50pm UK time, 40 minutes from now.  3.12pm Before the coffee break, Rogge recommends that &quot;you might use it to celebrate the birthday of Mr Frankie Fredericks&quot;. Interesting idea, but let&apos;s go with it. So here he is, coming second in something, by a considerable margin. Happy 42nd birthday, Frankie! See you in a little more than half an hour.      Spaniards gather in central Madrid to proudly cheer their city to Olympic glory. Or inevitable first-round elimination. Whatever. Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images    3.50pm So here we go then. All round the world, in Rio, Madrid and Chicago, and maybe even in Tokyo even though it&apos;s late and I can&apos;t find any photos of it, people are gathering to witness what is about to happen.     Brazilians get ready for a(nother) beach party in Rio. Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/AP    And what is about to happen is this: a vote. If no city gets a clear majority of the valid votes, the city that gets the least will be rejected and they&apos;ll vote again, and again, until one city does get a majority of all the valid votes cast (abstentions, spoiled ballot papers etc don&apos;t count).     Crowds flock to Daley Square in Chicago to cheer their city home. Basketball legend Scottie Pippen is there, apparently. Photograph: M. Spencer Green/AP    But, though Jacques Rogge told everyone to be back in the hall at 3.50, there&apos;s still no action and the screens are saying that they&apos;ll resume at 4.10pm instead. I&apos;ll let you know, obviously. In the meantime, here are some pictures of parties in progress...  4.05pm Andrew Siegler is actually in Rio right now! &quot;There&apos;s a giant party on the beach in Copacabana,&quot; he reports. &quot;Half of the city doesn&apos;t have to work today, so I&apos;ve heard some predictions of 500,000 people there (probably overly optimistic). Sounds almost as exciting as a Guardian live blog.&quot; Almost.  4.11pm Action! Frankie Fredericks, on his birthday, is a scrutineer!  4.12pm When I say action, of course, I use the word in its loosest possible sense. The first action is to conduct a draw to assign numbers to each of the candidate cities, which can thereafter be used in the voting process. You dig? The first number, weirdly, is eight.  4.16pm The voting rules are being read. Slowly. If there&apos;s a tie at any point, there&apos;ll be a revote between the two tied cities. Tracy Mohr is in Chicago. &quot;The locals seem to be just about wetting themselves in anticipation,&quot; she says. &quot;If Rio wins it, there will be a lot of disappointed people.&quot;  4.20pm Everybody has a voting box. The full list of cities and numbers is:Chicago - 4Rio - 7Tokyo - 8Madrid - 9Just in case you&apos;re there and want to know who you&apos;re voting for. What was wrong with just having 1, 2, 3 and 4 I&apos;m not sure.  4.21pm They&apos;re voting! Our man at the scene, Owen Gibson, has this report: &quot;IOC members back in their seats and tension mounting here. Consensus still that it will be extremely close with just a couple of votes in it. Madrid, tipped by some as a potential dark horse, would appear to be out of the running following a fairly pedestrian presentation. Rio now seems to be the most fancied bid among my colleagues.&quot;  4.23pm Vote closed! That was quick.  4.24pm People are passing around pieces of paper. One of them has run across the stage to show a piece of paper to Jacques Rogge.  4.25pm Chicago are out!  4.26pm So we&apos;re on to a second round, no city having got a clear majority in the first round, but the pre-vote favourites, Chicago, are the first to go. This is a turn-up for the books. They&apos;ve voting again already!  4.27pm The second round of voting has closed! Let&apos;s shuffle some papers!  4.28pm  One abstention this time, so 95 valid ballots. And Tokyo&apos;s out!  4.29pm So it&apos;s Rio or Madrid! The final round of voting is about to start. Crikey, the nervous tension here at Guardian Towers is incredible.  4.31pm Voting has closed! Seconds to go here...  4.31 and a half pm Some people in suits are shaking their heads a bit. Frankie Fredericks is one of them. They&apos;re writing things down. They&apos;ve passed the paper to the gopher boy...  4.32pm: &quot;You have elected a city,&quot; says Jacques Rogge. &quot;The election is over and will be announced later on.&quot; That&apos;s a bit of a disappointment.  4.34pm So they&apos;re not going to tell us who&apos;s won for an hour! An hour!  4.37pm More from Owen Gibson, our man on the spot: &quot;Major shock here and a slap in the face for Obama. Madrid very much back in it - lacklustre presentation but lots of political clout within the IOC.&quot;       4.40pm Tracy Mohr reports from the dejected streets of Chicago: &quot;No riots \u2013 just a lot of sad pandas. And here I was ready to rent my house at an exorbitant price.&quot; And here&apos;s a musical widget that I had all prepared for a Chicago win but I&apos;ll never get another chance to use. See how many times you can play this between now and 5.30pm without becoming suicidal. I&apos;ll be back in half an hour.    Who should host the 2016 Olympic Games?(trends)   4.45pm Hang on, why don&apos;t we have a vote ourselves? I&apos;m getting a lot of pro-Rio sentiment through your emails, but let&apos;s see what happens in the next half-hour, eh?  5.02pm I just can&apos;t believe they&apos;re making us wait so long. &quot;Usain Bolt could have run 335km since this live blog started,&quot; calculates Andy from Earlsfield. Keep voting y&apos;all.  5.05pm And thanks to the many readers who have told me that the Prince of Orange is a member of Dutch royalty, and that not knowing that nugget of information exposes me as a total idiot.  5.10pm &quot;I&apos;m backing the Madrid bid,&quot; says Neil Withers, &quot;cos I had a fiver on them to win at 15 or 16 to 1 this morning. In a four horse race, when they&apos;ve got 89-year-old IOC legend Samaranch in the saddle? Bargain.&quot;  5.12pm &quot;Cool Rob&quot; is in Chicago. And he&apos;s unhappy. &quot;Memo to future US Presidents: do not waste time with dog and pony shows to impress Euro kleptocracies.&quot; Ouch.  5.15pm They&apos;re now filing into a new room for the announcement. I&apos;m not entirely sure what the whole new-room thing&apos;s about, as this one is smaller than the last and they&apos;ve had to leave loads of people outside. It&apos;s a bit more of a theatre this one, where the last was just a great big exhibition centre-type space.      The latest scenes from Chicago's Daley Plaza show the shocked faces of celebration-starved locals. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images    5.23pm Andrew from Chicago is &quot;not too upset over Chicago not winning the bid. I think it will be Madrid that wins, but I&apos;m pulling for Rio.&quot; You might not be upset, chum, but it looks like plenty of people were.  5.25pm Still a few minutes to cast your own vote (scroll down to 4.45pm)  5.27pm Everyone in the hall just stood up. I thought for a minute they were doing the Mexican wave, but it turned out to be wishful thinking.  5.30pm Action! And an email from Yves Tixier. &quot;Do you think the one-hour delay was for Rogge to try and convince delegates that this time, the Olympics should go to the best candidate city, and not the one that offered the best bribes to voters?&quot; He&apos;s from Paris, by the way.  5.31pm Our own Jonathan Edwards is co-presenting, and he tells us that &quot;a little under half an hour&quot; still separates us from the announcement. Hang on, he&apos;s just started speaking French! Badly!  5.33pm They&apos;re going to show us the highlights from Beijing first. Eagle-eyed readers will notice that this blog has been ongoing since 7.45am this morning. We feel entitled to a little impatience at this point.  5.35pm And now the highlights of Copenhagen! Which include, apparently, drinking milk and eating strawberries.  3.37pm And now the highlights of London! No decent strawberries here, sadly, but lots of people on bicycles.  5.38pm And now the highlights of Chicago&apos;s presentation. Do we really need to see this? They&apos;re out, dammit! Get on with it!  5.40pm &quot;The only people who are bummed out here in Chicago are white people who live in the suburbs,&quot; reports Chicago native Bobby Otter. &quot;Most people in Chicago didn&apos;t want the games. I&apos;m sure most of the city breathed a huge sigh of relief when we didn&apos;t get them. But as far as the IOC, what a joke ... the fact that Madrid is in the final two goes to show that Europe is still drastically over represented in pretty much everything, from the World Cup on down. Less Europe, more world I say.&quot;  5.41pm Now a video from the Tokyo team. Interesting that the first two cities to present were the first two to go, in order of presentation. Were they really the worst two cities on show, or do IOC delegates just have terribly short memories?  5.43pm Now a video from the Rio team. Going out on a limb here, but I reckon that a video from Madrid could be coming up sometime soon.  5.44pm It&apos;s a video from the Madrid team! You might have to wait for the IOC, but I&apos;ll be revealing the results of our own poll in just six minutes&apos; time. So if you&apos;ve not voted, scroll down and do your thang.  5.45pm Highlights of the voting now. People in suits shuffling bits of paper. A round of applause for Chicago who, says Jonathan Edwards, &quot;did a great job&quot;. Tokyo, meanwhile, get a round of applause for their &quot;excellent bid&quot;.  5.47pm We have got our first glimpse of the white envelope which contains the name of the winning city. But they&apos;re not opening it yet.  5.47pm So Jacques Rogge is about to make his announcement, after the IOC anthem. Our vote, meanwhile ended thus:Rio 64%Madrid 22%I&apos;m a grumpy killjoy 14%So the Guardian readership has a pretty clear favourite. But which way will the IOC go?  5.50pm &quot;Like in any competition, there can only be one winner,&quot; says Rogge. The envelope is on its way to him now...  5.50pm It&apos;s Rio!       5.51pm Dejection for Raul, mayhem for the Rio team. Tears. Real, genuine man-blubbing!  5.53pm Still scenes of celebration from Copenhagen. Not much else happening. Here&apos;s a suggested soundtrack, though:  5.55pm So it&apos;s over. After 10 and a bit hours. I&apos;ve got to say, any other decision would have been perverse: Rio&apos;s presentation was much better than Madrid&apos;s, South America has never, ever hosted an Olympic Games and Europe are hosting in 2012. I&apos;m stunned that Madrid got so far. It&apos;s a lovely city though. Really very nice.  5.57pm Apparently the crowds in Madrid are chanting &quot;tonto, tonto&quot; \u2013 &quot;fools, fools&quot;. Perhaps at themselves, for getting their hopes up so unnecessarily.  5.59pm Lawrence Bishop, who is from Atlanta, reports that &quot;local businesses lost a tremendous amount of money, time and effort&quot; in what sounds like a pretty depressing experience there in 1996 (sounds like absolutely nobody enjoyed that one), so maybe no disaster that Chicago missed out?  6.02pm So that&apos;s all from me. It&apos;s been a pleasure accompanying you through the last, er, many hours. After an experience like that, the seven years between now and 2016 will just fly by."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/02/indonesia-earthquake-woman-rescued", "sentences": ["We are struggling to pull them out.&quot; South Korea, Switzerland and Singapore are among the countries to have sent civil emergency teams."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T08:10:39Z", "title": "3,000 could be buried after Indonesia quake, say officials", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Barack Obama", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "     As many as 3,000 people could be buried under the rubble of thousands of buildings in Sumatra, Indonesian officials said today, as the search and rescue operation intensified in the wake of this week&apos;s earthquake. Foreign aid teams flew in tents, water, medicine, food and hundreds of emergency workers after the authorities admitted they were struggling to cope with the aftermath of the 7.6-magnitude quake, which has left hundreds dead. One woman was rescued from the ruins of a school in Padang, the city close to the epicentre, more than 40 hours after it was destroyed in the earthquake. But there were reports of at least three schoolgirls buried under rubble in the school. The Times reported that faint voices of the three could be heard from under the wreckage of the school, but that rescuers feared that any effort to remove the debris could prompt a catastrophic cave-in. Official figures put the number of people killed at 715, but one UN estimate said the figure was 1,100. Officials said they expected the death toll to increase as the scale of the devastation became clearer. Rustam Pakaya, the crisis centre chief at the health ministry, said more than 2,000 people had been injured and thousands were missing. Priyadi Kardono, a spokesman for the disaster management agency, said more than 20,000 buildings and houses had been seriously damaged or destroyed. A Guardian reporter who reached the town of Pariaman further up the coast found that almost every building had been damaged and that people were sitting under makeshift tents, waiting for further help. In Padang, the 21-year-old student rescued from the STBA Prayoga language school was pulled out after rescuers dug a tunnel through debris. Onlookers applauded as the woman, called Sari, was carried to an ambulance on a stretcher. Her eyes were closed, but one rescuer said she was able to talk. Her uncle said he was overjoyed that she had been saved. &quot;She said, &apos;I&apos;m hungry, thirsty,&apos; and they gave her some milk,&quot; he added. Other families were anxiously waiting for news. Tommy Erwinsyah, 29, said his wife, Suci, had been lying next to Sari. &quot;Her leg is trapped under the concrete floor that fell on her. They can&apos;t lift or break it so now they will try to use an air compressor to lift it,&quot; he said. &quot;Last night, I spoke to her. Her voice is very clear. I hope she can get out today. I went into the tunnel and I could hear her voice. I could see her hand.&quot; The government admitted it was struggling to cope, and the health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, appealed for foreign aid. &quot;We need help from foreign countries for evacuation efforts,&quot; she said in remarks carried by AFP and the BBC. &quot;We need them to provide skilled rescuers with equipment. Our main problem is that there are a lot of victims still trapped in the rubble. We are struggling to pull them out.&quot; South Korea, Switzerland and Singapore are among the countries to have sent civil emergency teams. British search and rescue experts are also on their way to the disaster scene. The US president, Barack Obama, who spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, pledged to support the recovery effort, and the European commission said it would provide \u20ac3m (\u00a32.7m) to meet initial humanitarian needs. Witnesses said that almost one-third of buildings in the centre of Padang had been destroyed. &quot;So many buildings are collapsed,&quot; said Enda Balina, of World Vision, one of the first international aid organisations to reach the city. &quot;The city&apos;s infrastructure has collapsed. We went around the city this morning. In the downtown area, three out of every five buildings has been affected, some heavily damaged. The government is trying to get people out of the rubble.&quot; It has emerged that Fauzi Bahar, the mayor of Padang, last year asked for extra money to prepare for evacuating the town in the event of an earthquake. The request was turned down by the government. Unconfirmed reports from aid workers suggested that Pariaman, a town of 80,000 people near Padang, may have been largely destroyed by the quake. Early reports from Pariaman described a 1km fracture in the town&apos;s main road and the dome of the town&apos;s largest mosque lying on the ground."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/02/lewis-hamilton-felipe-massa-singapore", "sentences": ["Speaking after the first day of practice for Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix, Hamilton said he was &quot;a bit surprised and shocked&quot; by the Brazilian&apos;s suggestion that Renault&apos;s fixing of last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix had cost the Ferrari driver a victory that would have given him the title.", "So I&apos;m a bit surprised and shocked to hear him say that, to be honest.&quot; Massa was leading the Singapore race when Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s deliberate crash brought out the safety car and triggered the sequence of events that eventually allowed Piquet&apos;s Renault team-mate, Fernando Alonso, to triumph."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T09:20:05Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton shocked by Massa's claim that Crashgate cost him 2008 title", "tags": ["Formula One", "Lewis Hamilton", "Felipe Massa", "Renault", "McLaren", "Ferrari", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton today rejected Felipe Massa&apos;s claim that he had been robbed of the 2008 Formula One world championship.

We had quite a fair battle throughout and I&apos;ve always found him to be a fair driver. So I&apos;m a bit surprised and shocked to hear him say that, to be honest.&quot; Massa was leading the Singapore race when Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s deliberate crash brought out the safety car and triggered the sequence of events that eventually allowed Piquet&apos;s Renault team-mate, Fernando Alonso, to triumph. Massa joined the majority of the field by stopping to refuel under the safety car but a botched pit stop by Ferrari cost him any chance of a points finish. Massa lost the world title by a single point. &quot;Everything that happened was robbery but nothing has happened in terms of the race. The result didn&apos;t change. This is not right,&quot; Massa said in an interview with Globo television in Brazil. &quot;The robbery changed the championship. I lost [the title] by one point.&quot; Massa said he did consult Ferrari&apos;s team lawyers about trying to have the result overturned, but between them they decided against it. The Ferrari team principal, Stefano Domenicali, said the team had no plans to pursue any legal action now. &quot;It is not in our interest from a legal point of view,&quot; he said. &quot;We knew that the World Motor Sport Council \u2013 unfortunately, I have to say \u2013 did not have the power to change the result. It&apos;s clear that certain things happened in that race which were not right and that we have paid a price for that. Felipe, of course, has paid the biggest price of all.&quot; The battle for the 2009 championship continues on Sunday at Suzuka, meanwhile, with Jenson Button leading his Brawn team-mate, Rubens Barrichello, by 15 points with three races remaining. Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull has an outside chance but Button needs only to score five more points than Barrichello to become the second Englishman in succession to win the title. Button and the rest of the field were hampered by wet conditions which limited track time. &quot;I feel sorry for the fans at Suzuka,&quot; Button said. &quot;But, unfortunately, we can&apos;t get any useful information in these conditions with so much water on the track. We spent the morning session working on the balance of the car with the wet and intermediate tyres to ensure that we are prepared if the same wet weather does continue over the weekend. It was important to achieve some running and it feels good to be back at Suzuka. This is a great drivers&apos; track, so hopefully we&apos;ll get some dry running on Saturday.&quot; Hamilton was more frustrated than most since this is the world champion&apos;s first visit to Suzuka, the only figure-of-eight track in Formula One. &quot;I love the track, it&apos;s the best I&apos;ve ever driven,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I had a great time today, even though it was wet. We weren&apos;t supposed to be running in the second session in the afternoon, but I couldn&apos;t help it. I had to go out and have a little bit of fun. I&apos;ve always wanted to drive here from the very early stages, from when I was watching F1 as a boy and I noticed this circuit then. There is such great history here. This was the one track I hadn&apos;t been to and I enjoyed my first couple of laps here this morning. &quot;It&apos;s a bit tricky for the drivers that haven&apos;t been here before. Even though we&apos;ve driven it today in the wet, it&apos;s completely different in the dry.

As the Greenpeace slogan said: &quot;Right city, wrong date.&quot; Mr Obama was not in Denmark to save the world from climate change, but to promote Chicago&apos;s Olympic bid. His wife, Michelle, and Opah Winfrey were also there. They were not alone: King Juan Carlos of Spain, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and the Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama all pressed the flesh for their cities. Note, not their countries. Yes, Tony and Cherie Blair started the inflationary spiral by going to Singapore to help win the 2012 Olympics for London. But has this ritual got out of hand? Mr Obama was the first sitting US president to attend the International Olympic Committee&apos;s jamboree. Was it appropriate for him to do so? The next question is whether it was in the interests of Rio, Chicago, Madrid or Tokyo to win the games. The evidence is underwhelming. The games transformed Barcelona and were a success in Sydney, but the list of cities with empty relics and hefty bills is longer: Atlanta, Athens, Montreal and Moscow. The Beijing games were in a category of their own, sending a message that China had joined the modern world. But it locked up dissidents who uttered anything less than the authorised text. And then, of course, there is London. Started in times of plenty, the cost of making Stratford the largest construction site in Europe has more than doubled in four years. Surrounding boroughs are adamant they won&apos;t be saddled with the costs of running venues that are almost certainly going to require subsidies. The Olympic Park Legacy Company promises that a further 10,000 new homes will be developed on the site, 40% of them for families. Tessa Jowell, the Olympics minister, says that London has anticipated the legacy needs of the games in a way that no other Olympic city has. But past experience shows that it is easier to make promises than to fulfil them. One promise in the original bid, to increase the number of people playing sport or taking regular exercise, is already in trouble. Seen through the prism of looming public service cuts, the glitter of the games is not as golden as it once seemed. So, whether or not Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid should have reacted the way they did when they heard they had lost the bid to host the 2016 summer games is not clear. Having the modern games permanently stationed in its ancient home, Greece an idea that surfaced during the games in Athens, has lost traction since. Rio de Janeiro will now, in the words of its slogan, live its passion. The games will go to South America for the first time. It may be a while before they want them back."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/audiobook-reviews-sue-arnold", "sentences": ["After the fall of Singapore, Toosey could have been evacuated with other senior officers, but he refused to abandon his men and spent the next three and a half years enduring the same appalling Japanese PoW conditions, starvation and brutality as they did."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T23:06:27Z", "title": "Audiobooks", "tags": ["Audiobooks", "Books", "Culture", "Charles Darwin", "Biography"], "article": "The Voyage of the Beagle, by Charles Darwin, read by Richard Dawkins (6hrs abridged, CSA Word, \u00a318.59) Of course, one of these days, you&apos;re going to read On the Origin of Species.

Well, it is if you start with Darwin&apos;s journal, published in 1839, recording the five years he spent as resident naturalist circumnavigating the world aboard HMS Beagle. It reads more like an adventure story than the meticulous scientific research that 20 years later became his famously controversial, mould-breaking treatise on evolutionary biology. Without Richard Dawkins and his persuasively mellifluous voice (five minutes into The God Delusion and I&apos;d embraced atheism with both arms) I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have warmed to the 22-year-old Darwin and his acclaimed powers of observation. It is one thing to observe that in Tierra del Fuego three birds use their wings for other purposes besides flight, &quot;the penguin as fins, the steamer as paddles and the ostrich as sails&quot;, but another altogether to advise us that the native Fuegians are &quot;poor wretches, stunted in their growth, their hideous faces bedaubed with white paint, their skins filthy and greasy, their hair entangled, their voices discordant and their gestures violent. Viewing such men one can hardly make oneself believe that they are our fellow creatures, inhabitants of the same world.&quot; Admittedly the natives had at one point turned nasty and threatened the tourists with stones and clubs, but even when they&apos;re perfectly friendly, like the Maoris in the Bay of Islands, they are treated to young Charlie&apos;s Victorian imperialist &quot;me white man, you savage&quot; views. &quot;Filthy&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot; are favourite descriptions of people, but not necessarily of their customs, such as, in Brazil, the remedy for a broken leg: &quot;Kill and cut open two puppies and bind them each side of the broken limb.&quot; And what about Galapagos finches, you clamour, whistles thoroughly whetted. Better read the follow-up and find out. Wild Life, written and read by Simon King (2hrs, Heavy Entertainment, \u00a314.99) King has been a wildlife cameraman for more than 30 years, starting with the elusive ginger badger in Somerset and graduating to more dangerous assignments. He has been charged by elephants in Sri Lanka and attacked in his tree-top hide by a swarm of 100,000 bees in Kenya. He was filming white-fronted bee-eaters, birds that catch bees in mid-flight, then rub them against branches to get rid of their stings. But there was a glitch, and suddenly, he recalls, it was like living in a scene from a Hitchcock movie, thousands of stings piercing the canvas roof and walls of the hide, venom dropping on to his bare limbs, bees sucking the sweat from his face (yes, he was sweating) like nectar. I wish I&apos;d seen the shot of a 3,000kg, 5-metre-long bull elephant seal in South Georgia sneezing on him. His camera and his entire head were covered with foul, fishy, green slime. It was good for the yuk factor. Essential listening for animal lovers.

He was a trainer, supervisor, researcher and clinician who wrote many books and articles that were an important influence on professionals in adult and child psychiatry and social care. Together with Ros Draper, he edited more than 50 books in the Systemic Thinking and Practice series, published by the psychotherapy specialists Karnac Books. These covered a range of topics including child protection, organisational consultation and the practice and theory of systemic family therapy. A consultant clinical psychologist and systemic family psychotherapist at the Tavistock Clinic in London, where he worked for 37 years, David was ill with bile duct cancer for 20 months and, during this time, wrote about his knowledge of mortality. Born in Chicago, Illinois, David often talked about his happy childhood and summers spent with his elder brother and parents near Lake Michigan. He was educated at Hinsdale Township high school, Chicago, moving to Prairie Village West school, Kansas City, at 16, when his father changed jobs. David gained a BA in psychology at Kenyon College, in Gambier, Ohio, and completed his clinical psychology training at Boston University. He moved to Britain in 1971 and started work as a child psychotherapist in Hillingdon, north-west London, moving to the Tavistock Clinic, in Hampstead, in 1972. There he became a pioneer in the development of systemic family therapy, in which an individual&apos;s problems are considered within a wider family setting. He was particularly interested in the work of a group of Italian psychiatrists, Mara Selvini-Palazzoli, Giuliana Prata, Luigi Boscolo and Gianfranco Cecchin. David, with Draper, was the main British proponent of the Milan approach. Following the publication of P Reder and D Pollard&apos;s influential paper Working With the Milan Method: Twenty Questions (1983), they published the first of their books, Applications of Systemic Therapy: the Milan Method, in 1985. At that time, mental health professionals typically worked on a one- to-one basis with individuals \u2013 the idea of including families was new. RD Laing had written about the effect of pathological family communications on individuals&apos; mental health, but David&apos;s approach sought to understand all points of view and helped families to understand members&apos; perspectives and find their own solutions. His ability to present complex ideas clearly was a key factor in his success as a teacher and writer. He pioneered innovative approaches based on systemic principles, and published several books, including Teaching Systemic Thinking (1991), written with Draper; Learning Consultation (1995); and Taking Positions in the Organisation (2006), with Marianne Groenbeck. He also played a leading role in consulting to teams and agencies within the NHS and other public services on matters such as managing organisational change and delivering better child protection services. David liked to encourage new ideas to meet the changing needs of mental health professionals and families. He developed ideas from social constructionism and wrote about the ways in which people &quot;construct&quot; realities between them through conversations; he described and explained how our realities become organised by the language we use. By avoiding the use of pathologising language \u2013 finding symptoms of abnormalities \u2013 and using a framework that sought to make connections between different standpoints, he aimed to help families, and workers in an organisation, to create new meanings that enabled them to identify their strengths and resources. David was committed to his work and was always grateful for the support that his wife, Jane, and their children gave him to pursue his passion for it; he travelled widely, and taught in many parts of the world. Although the Tavistock Clinic is viewed primarily as a psychoanalytic institution, it is largely through David&apos;s work that it is now also at the forefront of systemic training and practice. A celebration was held at the Tavistock in May to mark David&apos;s contribution to the fields of family therapy and organisational consultancy; practitioners and students came from India, Singapore, the US and many European countries to pay tribute to his influence. Many who spent time with David felt that they shared a special relationship because of his kind manner and wisdom. He loved games and jokes and was able to provide humour even in his very darkest hours. Even in great pain, he continued to want to know what was happening to his students and what new ideas were being developed; he always contributed something to our thinking. David is survived by Jane and their two children, Jesse and Briony. \u2022 David Campbell, systemic psychotherapist and clinical psychologist, born 8 December 1943; died 25 August 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/05/jenson-button-damon-hill-formula-one", "sentences": ["It is good on high speed corners and they have shown that they are good on slow corners, as in Singapore.&quot; Button acknowledges that his team-mate Barrichello will be going all-out to join Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Felipe Massa in the pantheon of Brazilian greats who have won their home grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-05T18:56:14Z", "title": "Jenson Button must rely on his instinct to win title", "tags": ["Jenson Button", "Formula One", "Brawn", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Jenson Button should ignore all strategic advice on how to clinch the Formula One world championship and concentrate on doing it his own way. That was the advice given today by Damon Hill, the British world champion who has first-hand experience of exactly what Button is going through. Button finished eighth in Sunday&apos;s Japanese grand prix at Suzuka and goes to Brazil for the penultimate round of the season 15 points ahead of the race winner, Sebastian Vettel, and 14 ahead of his Brawn team-mate Rubens Barrichello. In 1996 Hill found himself battling down to the wire against his team-mate, Jacques Villeneuve, and did not clinch the title until the final race after a tense shoot-out between the Williams drivers. Hill believes this is a crucial moment in the title chase and Button must follow his instinct and drive the way he feels his best for the situation. &quot;Everyone is looking for him to clinch the championship as quickly and decisively as possible,&quot; said Hill. &quot;But it&apos;s his career, his championship campaign and it may be nerve-wracking to watch for those of us who are supporting him but he&apos;s the one facing the challenge, he&apos;s the one doing the job. &quot;In situations like this you just have to do what you think is best at the time. There&apos;s no point in worrying what anybody else is doing, because the only performance he can influence is his own. It was a similar situation when Jacques and I were contesting the championship. I knew I had done the best job I could preparing for the final race of the season, after which I just had to get on with it and see how events unfolded. &quot;Ultimately you can only do what your car is capable of. There were a few moments in 96 when I thought I might be able to close the job down before the end of the season but these opportunities are not always as straightforward as they seem.&quot; Hill said he would be thrilled if Button did become Britain&apos;s 10th world Formula One champion. &quot;I wish Jenson well. I think it would be really terrific for the sport in this country if we had back-to-back world champions, with Jenson following on from Lewis [Hamilton]. But he must do it his way.&quot; For his part, Button believes that the momentum is with him, even though he had to battle through from 12th place on the starting grid at Suzuka following a grid penalty which made it hard work to come through to an eventual eighth. &quot;We are doing the best job we can in a difficult situation,&quot; he said of the Brawn team for whom he won the first six of the season&apos;s seven races in an impressive opening streak. &quot;[But] we keep getting ourselves into these tricky [qualifying] situations and we are then getting ourselves out of them in the race. Whatever the result, Button knows that he will come out of the Brazilian grand prix at S\u00e3o Paulo&apos;s Interlagos track on 18 October at least four points ahead of either rival. But he would like to wrap up the title before the final race at Abu Dhabi a fortnight later. &quot;I go to Brazil positive and looking forward to the challenge because it will be a challenge,&quot; he told Autosport.com. &quot;Sebastian Vettel is quick and his Red Bull seems very quick. It is good on high speed corners and they have shown that they are good on slow corners, as in Singapore.&quot; Button acknowledges that his team-mate Barrichello will be going all-out to join Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Felipe Massa in the pantheon of Brazilian greats who have won their home grand prix. &quot;Rubens is always quick there,&quot; said Button, &quot;so it is going to be a challenging weekend.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/06/qadbak-notts-county-sauber", "sentences": ["Nothing wrong with that, until you consider that they were there to discuss the punishment due to Flavio Briatore for his part in race-fixing in Singapore last year."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-05T23:10:03Z", "title": "Notts County and BMW Sauber on edge of cracks in Qadbak facade | Matt Scott", "tags": ["Notts County", "League Two", "Football", "Sauber", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Fresh indications have appeared that cracks are opening in Qadbak&apos;s &quot;multibillion-dollar&quot; investment portfolio, which includes Notts County and, supposedly, BMW Sauber.

Premier party time The surest sign yet that the political wind is blowing in a new direction comes with the Premier League decamping to the Tory party conference. The league&apos;s head of public affairs, Bill Bush, was a chief of staff to &quot;Red&quot; Ken Livingstone at the Greater London Council in the 1980s. Bush was also Tony Blair&apos;s head of research at No 10. Other senior Premier League figures, also staunch Labourites, have headed up to Manchester. They point out that after years of absence the Premier League attended the conference last year too but that just demonstrates how Bush&apos;s knowledge of the lay of the political land has not gone to waste. A fit and proper mess   What a weird world is that inhabited by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile. In between writing coercive letters to key FIA figures its president, Max Mosley, revealed last week that 20 people recently turned up to the World Motorsport Council to find Bernie Ecclestone at the table. Nothing wrong with that, until you consider that they were there to discuss the punishment due to Flavio Briatore for his part in race-fixing in Singapore last year. Briatore and Ecclestone are partners in Queens Park Rangers. A ban from the WMSC could entail Briatore being ordered out by the Football League, under its &quot;fit-and-proper&quot; protocols. That presents a clear conflict of interest, affecting Ecclestone&apos;s financial interests outside motor sport. But as far as FIA corporate governance &quot;processes&quot; are concerned, that is no bar to participating in discussion about Briatore&apos;s sanction, and apparently still less to voting on it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/oct/06/crib-sheet-email", "sentences": ["Undeterred, Gove now plans to look at schools in the US and Canada, as well as vocational colleges in Singapore and Germany."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T11:04:42Z", "title": "Crib sheet email 06.10.09", "tags": ["Schools", "Higher education", "Further education", "Education"], "article": "So, the Tories.

Mawhinney and his board, supported by the overwhelming majority of league clubs, have stood up strongly when imposing severe points penalties on clubs that have plunged into administration owing millions, then sought to emerge without the necessary 75% agreement of creditors. Yet tomorrow, the league faces probably the sternest examination of its regulatory backbone since it became the first football body, in 2004, to introduce a &quot;fit and proper person test&quot; for club directors and owners. That test, banning convicted fraudsters, bankrupts and directors of two football club insolvencies from being 30% owners or directors of clubs, set an upright standard, but has never really been tested. In a meeting that Mawhinney will chair tomorrow, the league&apos;s board will have on its agenda the application of the fit and proper person test to three clubs: Notts County, Leeds United and Queens Park Rangers. The Notts County issue is whether the league is satisfied that the new owners of the club, the investors in the Qadbak investment fund, which is registered in the tax-haven of the British Virgin Islands, of which little has been publicly revealed, have been identified sufficiently to the league to be passed as &quot;fit and proper people.&quot; The Leeds United case poses particularly serious questions. As revealed in this column last week, the club&apos;s chairman, Ken Bates, has sworn a statement in a Jersey court saying he made an &quot;error&quot; when he previously said that he jointly owned the club&apos;s holding company, the Forward Sports Fund. In fact, his statement disclosed, Forward, registered in the tax-haven of then Cayman Islands, is owned by the holders of 10,000 shares, whom the fund&apos;s Swiss administrators have refused to identify. The league has in its files the names Leeds advanced as the club&apos;s owners after Forward took over the club, appointing Bates as the chairman, in January 2005, then again in 2007 when the fund bought Leeds out of a \u00a335m administration. If Bates put himself forward to the league as a 50% owner, which he now says was an &quot;error,&quot; Mawhinney and his board must consider whether Bates, and Leeds, breached the league&apos;s rules by failing to disclose the true owners. The league must also now ask the club to reveal who its true owners are, and they must be passed as &quot;fit and proper.&quot; The league&apos;s rules state that every club must provide a list of all its directors, and holders of 30% or more of a club&apos;s shares, within 14 days of a takeover. Any club that fails to comply with that rule &quot;shall be guilty of misconduct,&quot; the rules say, with penalties of &quot;fixed fines&quot;. Any club that &quot;intentionally or negligently&quot; provides to the league a &quot;false&quot; declaration as to who its directors and owners are, is deemed &quot;guilty of misconduct&quot;. The league has the power to bring disciplinary proceedings against a club and an individual director where that has happened. Leeds United and Bates, and his solicitor Mark Taylor, also a Leeds director, have refused to comment so far on how the &quot;error&quot; was made when Bates said he co-owned &quot;management shares&quot; in Forward, or to say who they submitted as the club&apos;s owners to the league. Of the three cases, the most clear cut appears to be the car crash that is Flavio Briatore. In November 2007, he became a QPR director and majority shareholder via his company, Sarita Capital Investments Inc, which is also registered in the British Virgin Islands. The minority stakes taken by Lakshmi Mittal and Bernie Ecclestone accorded QPR the unlikely status of world&apos;s richest club, which has not quite been merited by the limited investment that has followed. A fortnight ago, Briatore was hit with that swingeing ban by the World Motor Sport Council, which found that, as the principal of the Renault F1 team, he conspired with Pat Symonds, Renault&apos;s executive director of engineering, and the driver Nelson Piquet Jr, that Piquet would deliberately crash his car in the 2008 Singapore grand prix to seek advantage for Renault&apos;s other driver, Fernando Alonso. Briatore, according to the WMSC&apos;s written decision, &quot;repeatedly insisted he had no knowledge of the affair,&quot; which it found was &quot;a deliberate falsehood.&quot; In its verdict, the WMSC seemed to struggle adequately to express how beyond the pale this scandal was. As the team principal, it said, Briatore was in &quot;the position of highest responsibility,&quot; and also Piquet&apos;s manager. &quot;Mr Briatore manifestly did not guide Mr Piquet Jr appropriately,&quot; the judgment said, &quot;and indeed allowed and seemingly encouraged him to engage in potentially ruinous and life-threatening activities.&quot; The Football League&apos;s &quot;fit and proper persons test&quot; bars people, besides fraudsters, bankrupts and serial insolvents, if they are: &quot;Subject to a ban from involvement in the administration of a sport by a sports governing body or such other similar forms of disqualification as may operate from time to time.&quot; The ban on Briatore, declared by the WMSC, runs to a fat paragraph that seeks to be comprehensive and all-encompassing enough to reflect the enormity of what Briatore did. &quot;For an unlimited period,&quot; it ruled, &quot;the FIA does not intend to sanction any international event, championship, cup, trophy, challenge or series involving Mr Briatore in any capacity whatsoever, or grant any license to any team or other entity engaging Mr Briatore in any capacity whatsoever. It also hereby instructs all officials present at FIA-sanctioned events not to permit Mr Briatore access to any areas under the FIA&apos;s jurisdiction. Furthermore, it does not intend to grant or renew any superlicence granted to any driver who is associated (through a management contract or otherwise) with Mr Briatore, or any entity or individual associated with Mr Briatore.&quot; QPR&apos;s spokesman, Ian Taylor, said that neither Briatore nor any member of the club&apos;s board is making any public comment before the league meeting on Thursday. Since the WMSC decision was handed down, though, there have been suggestions that somehow this complete exclusion of Briatore from any FIA event, to the point of not physically allowing him in, still leaves him wriggle room to remain in football. The argument appears to be that Briatore has not been banned personally by the WMSC, just that other people have been banned from working with him, and that does not translate into him falling foul of the Football League&apos;s fit and proper person test. This reasoning appears to contradict both the total nature of the WMSC ban, and the catch-all wording of the Football League&apos;s own rule. It is difficult to see how the exclusion of Briatore by the FIA can amount to anything other than &quot;a ban from involvement in the administration of a sport.&quot; The Football League board must tomorrow make its decision in the public glare on these three clubs, whose circumstances ask different searching questions of the fit and proper person test. The time for congratulating itself just for having such a test has passed. Now the league must prove to the sporting world that it is serious, about upholding its rules to the letter, and being seen to do so."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/07/golf-2016-olympics-padraig-harrington", "sentences": ["The new process for adding to the 26 existing sports was introduced by the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, in an effort to avoid the farcical situation that unfolded in Singapore in 2005."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T23:10:02Z", "title": "Golf fighting for place at the Olympics as IOC prepares for vital vote", "tags": ["Rio 2016", "Golf", "Padraig Harrington", "Sport", "International Olympic Committee", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Padraig Harrington and Michelle Wie are among the golfers who have been drafted in to help the sport over the finishing line in its campaign to become an Olympic event, amid speculation that it could fall at the final hurdle. Golf&apos;s chances of becoming an Olympic sport remain in the balance ahead of Friday&apos;s vote on whether to admit it and rugby sevens to the programme for the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. The two sports were chosen from a list of seven by the International Olympic Committee executive board in August following an in-depth selection process. Some IOC members retain concerns about whether the Olympics would be the pinnacle of achievement for golfers ahead of the four majors, while others argue that it does not score well on the criterion of &quot;universality&quot; given the expense and difficulty of developing golf courses in Africa and parts of Asia. But Peter Dawson, chief executive of the Royal &amp; Ancient and a key figure in the bid in his role as the International Golf Federation&apos;s joint secretary, argued that, with more than 60 million players worldwide and members of the IGF in 120 countries, it scored better than most sports on its geographical spread. &quot;The growth of the game is going to be in eastern Europe, in Asia and in north Africa,&quot; he said. Dawson admitted some IOC members had raised concerns about whether the Olympics would represent the pinnacle of the sport but said they had not been widespread. &quot;We have been able to allay that fear by emphasising the broad support among the world&apos;s top players. There is only one Olympic tournament for every 16 majors,&quot; he said. Speaking from Copenhagen, where he has already met more than two-thirds of the members who will decide golf&apos;s fate on Friday, Dawson said he remained &quot;hopeful, but not complacent&quot; that it would achieve the simple majority required. The International Rugby Board looks sure to win approval for rugby sevens after promising to ditch the format&apos;s World Cup if it wins inclusion, in order to make the Olympics the highest honour of its four-year cycle, and emphasising its ability to\u00a0bring the sport to new parts of the world. The IRB president, Bernard Lapasset, its secretary general, Mike Miller, and the former New Zealand international Jonah Lomu are in Copenhagen ahead of the final vote. The new process for adding to the 26 existing sports was introduced by the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, in an effort to avoid the farcical situation that unfolded in Singapore in 2005. Then, baseball and softball were voted off the Olympic programme but no sports received enough votes to replace them. Some IOC members have privately voiced disgruntlement that they will not be offered a choice of sports from which to pick and have speculated that golf might suffer as a result of a protest vote. But Craig Reedie, the British IOC member who was part of the programme commission that evaluated the seven sports, said: &quot;The executive board clearly feels it is giving the members the guidance that was requested of them.&quot; Harrington and Wie will be joined by the women&apos;s world No2, Suzann Petterson of Norway, and the 16-year-old British Amateur champion, Matteo Manassero of Italy, for the final presentations in an attempt to showcase the sport&apos;s wide appeal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/07/world-cup-2010-opening-concert", "sentences": ["An F1 Rocks event, featuring Beyonc\u00e9 and Pharrell Williams, at the recent Singapore grand prix is expected to be the first of several such events designed to widen the sport&apos;s appeal and offer new opportunities for sponsors."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T23:10:07Z", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 set for World Cup call-up as Fifa upstages traditional opening", "tags": ["World Cup 2010", "Fifa", "Jay Z", "Beyonc\u00e9", "Football", "Sport", "Hip-hop", "Music", "Culture", "World Cup"], "article": "As part of an attempt to banish memories of Diana Ross fluffing a penalty and flag- waving parades, Fifa has contracted Kevin Wall, the man behind live music spectaculars for Madonna, Jay-Z and Michael Jackson, to produce a Live 8-style event on the eve of the next World Cup.

Wall, who played a key role in Live 8 and helped pioneer large-scale global stadium shows with such acts as the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Jackson, will oversee the event through his company, Control Room, which organised Al Gore&apos;s series of Live Earth concerts in 2007.

With this celebratory kick-off event, football fans are in for a huge treat.&quot; Governing bodies and sports rights agencies are increasingly looking to plough the fertile common ground between celebrities from the worlds of music and sport. An F1 Rocks event, featuring Beyonc\u00e9 and Pharrell Williams, at the recent Singapore grand prix is expected to be the first of several such events designed to widen the sport&apos;s appeal and offer new opportunities for sponsors. Although the line-up of artists has yet to be finalised and will not be revealed until tickets go on sale, record labels are likely to want their biggest names involved given the likely global television audience. It is hoped that the three-hour concert will appeal to a younger demographic than the more traditional opening ceremony, which will still take place ahead of the opening match the following day.

The league chairman and his board considered the implications of the takeover at Notts County by an anonymous offshore trust, Flavio Briatore&apos;s indefinite ban from motor sport and the ever-obfuscatedownership of Leeds United. On all three points the league, following its first board meeting to consider how to react to those tests, declined to take action, announcing that it needs more information in every case. However it has taken steps to ensure that in future the ownership of clubs is declared to them. &quot;As of today, and having taken advice from legal counsel in regard to existing league regulations, it was unanimously agreed that it will be the policy of the board to insist that it is informed, with supporting evidence provided, of the ultimate beneficial owners of all Football League clubs,&quot; said the league in a statement. The new owners at Meadow Lane must follow up on two days of meetings held with the league&apos;s senior executives this week &quot;to clarify a few outstanding issues&quot;. Peter Trembling, Notts County&apos;s executive chairman, referred to the &quot;unique&quot; situation that has arisen at Notts, where the anonymous trust &quot;comes from the Middle East&quot;, without explaining how the investors Qadbak has claimed are behind it have denied any involvement. &quot;Quite rightly [the league] are protecting their members and the future of Notts County as well,&quot; he said. Briatore&apos;s ban for his part in the race-fixing at the Singapore grand prix last year would prohibit him from having a significant shareholding or directorial interest in a Football League club under the fit and proper person regulations. Currently he is a shareholder-director at Queens Park Rangers but any attempt to dislodge him from Loftus Road must be delayed until the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile&apos;s appeals process has run its course. &quot;The Board conducted a comprehensive review of the situation, including the receipt of advice from leading counsel,&quot; said the league in its statement. &quot;After considering all the information presently available to it and in the interest of due process, the Board will seek responses from Mr Briatore before commenting further.&quot; Lord Mawhinney&apos;s board was understood previously to be reluctant to tackle the third issue on the agenda: Ken Bates&apos;s ownership or otherwise of Leeds. As revealed in the Guardian, the former Chelsea chairman has issued an affidavit to retract as &quot;an error&quot; his previous claim to a Jersey court that he owns the Elland Road club.

The two sports had been recommended for inclusion in the 2016 Games ahead of squash, softball, baseball, roller sports and karate by the International Olympic Committee executive board in August and that decision was today ratified by the membership. The International Rugby Board delivered a 20-minute presentation that helped secure a comprehensive 81-8 vote in favour of the sport&apos;s inclusion in the games for the first time since 1924. The IRB secretary general, Mike Miller, and president, Bernard Lapasset, together with a panel of players that included Lomu and the Australian women&apos;s captain, Cheryl Soon, argued that the inclusion of sevens in the Olympics would help broaden the spread of countries that could win medals, grow the sport in new territories, and appeal to sponsors and fans. Golf, forced to answer criticisms from IOC members about gender equality at some clubs and the extent to which players would consider it the pinnacle of sporting achievement, was approved with a 63-27 majority. Padraig Harrington, who appeared onstage in Copenhagen alongside Michelle Wie and others, attempted to allay fears that top players would not consider an Olympic medal as an achievement on a par with winning a major title: &quot;Between now and 2016, there are 28 major championships but only one chance to win an Olympic gold medal. As a child growing up in Ireland the greatest plaudits were always given to the Olympians.&quot; Woods and Ernie Els sent video messages from the Presidents Cup to support the campaign. Woods, who has said he will compete in 2016 if he is still playing at the top level, said: &quot;It would be an honour for anyone who plays this game to become an Olympian.&quot; Both sports survived a backlash from some IOC members who were angry that they had not been allowed to vote on the full list of seven sports. The senior Canadian IOC member Dick Pound argued that the executive board had misinterpreted the advice of the members in the wake of a shambolic vote in Singapore in 2005 when baseball and softball were voted off the programme but no sport achieved a sufficient majority to replace them, leaving the London Olympics with 26 sports. &quot;This is a mistake, it&apos;s not fair on the other five sports and it&apos;s not a transparent process,&quot; he said. But Jacques Rogge, who was confirmed as the IOC president for a final four-year term in an earlier vote, argued that the executive board had only been following the advice of the membership and praised the decision to accept the two new sports. &quot;Time will show your decision was very wise,&quot; he said. Rugby will organise a four-day sevens tournament for 12 men&apos;s and women&apos;s teams. Golf will stage a 72-hole strokeplay tournament for men and women, with 60 men and 60 women in each field. The top 15 qualify regardless of how many come from the same country and the remaining 45 will comprise the highest-ranked players from nations who do not already have two players. In an earlier vote, the former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Craig Reedie was voted on to the executive board, becoming the first British representative since 1961.

In the biggest individual fraud perpetrated on small investors in the UK since failed investment firm Barlow Clowes two decades ago, investigators from the Serious Fraud Office, the City watchdog and Keydata&apos;s administrators are concentrating on following the money trail from the dead man, David Elias \u2013 a colourful businessman, fugitive from the UK legal system and a major figure in the Keydata saga. And in true thriller style, there are even question marks over whether Elias really is dead. Investment marketing firm Keydata specialised in &quot;innovative&quot; high- income investment bonds, sold via independent financial advisers and managed by SLS Capital \u2013 a Luxembourg-based firm in which Elias held shares. Some of the bonds promised a high 7.5% return with low risk, with the money put into US investments known as &quot;life settlements&quot; \u2013 a version of second-hand endowment policies. But when investors failed to receive income payments this year, Keydata Investment Services went into administration. City regulator the Financial Services Authority (FSA) applied to the courts in June to force Keydata&apos;s closure &quot;to protect investors&quot;, saying the firm was insolvent and that it was concerned about &quot;potentially missing assets&quot;. Since then, savers have gone without income while the Financial Services Compensation Scheme \u2013 the official rescue fund for customers of collapsed financial firms \u2013 has failed to step in. Following the Keydata cash trail leads to a fugitive from justice, a number of offshore firms of uncertain ownership, and ultimately to some of the world&apos;s best-known investment banks. It also leads to one overriding question. Why did a regulated UK investment firm entrust the nesteggs of thousands of mainly retired people to a less-than blue-chip firm without investigating those behind it? In early 2001, Keydata was a Scottish digital information group. It then merged with Reading-based Fedsure Investment Product Services. The FSA probed Keydata at this time but allowed the merger. Coincidentally, in May 2001 a warrant was issued in London for the arrest of David Michael Alexander Elias, a former barrister, after his failure to turn up at a public examination into his bankruptcy. Elias did not answer the warrant, telling the judge he had to stay in Singapore due to a rib injury which prevented him from travelling. He never returned to the UK. The paths of Keydata and Elias first crossed in 2005 after the publication of a favourable report on life settlements (US traded life insurance policies) from accountants KPMG. These, it said, were underpriced and, more importantly for savers, unaffected by stockmarket volatility. It wasn&apos;t long before Keydata launched &quot;secure income bonds&quot; that invested in life settlements, a concept few investors understood but which attracted millions of pounds. Savers and advisers were reassured by the presence of HSBC America and Dutch finance giant Fortis as, respectively, trustee and custodian, and by the FSA&apos;s regulation of Keydata. Investors say they were unaware that SLS was managing their funds. &quot;Money was controlled by blue-chip names. We felt safe,&quot; says one. SLS was originally majority-owned by a US hedge fund with Elias as a minority shareholder. The hedge fund soon disappeared in an opaque deal, leaving Elias in charge. Keydata investors say they were not informed when the blue-chip trustee and custodian were replaced by less well-known firms. Effectively Elias now had control of \u00a3280m in life settlement funds \u2013 \u00a3105m from Keydata customers and \u00a3175m of other people&apos;s money. He had promised to list SLS on the Luxembourg stock exchange, but didn&apos;t. A Keydata attempt to list it in 2007 also failed. In spite of these two setbacks, Keydata continued to market the bonds. It says that, because the quarterly income payments arrived on time to be sent to investors, it had no reason to query the arrangement. By the summer of last year, Elias was again strapped for cash, with expensive deals on a yacht and private jet to finance. With his full control of SLS he saw a way out by selling the bonds, even though they were not his to sell. &quot;In the madhouse following the collapse of Lehman Brothers [in September 2008], there was a firesale of assets around the globe. Elias simply took the bonds entrusted to SLS and sold them for cash to blue-chip banks across the world at around a quarter of their real value,&quot; says an investigator. But once the bonds were illegally sold on, Elias effectively operated as a Ponzi scheme \u2013 a pyramid-style scam. With no underlying investments, he paid income from any new money coming in. But that could not last and by the spring of this year Keydata and its investors were heading for trouble. Keydata says it was unaware of this. At around this time, Elias told friends he was suffering from pneumonia. He died, at 56, from complications on 8 May in Malaysia. His body was rapidly cremated and the ashes scattered. But is he really dead? &quot;Given his previous record of using medical conditions to escape creditors and the law, that the only witness to the body&apos;s identity was a manservant, and the ease of obtaining death certificates in some parts of the world, no one can 100% assume he is really deceased,&quot; says a source close to the investigation. Investor protection Many Keydata clients are in financial trouble. Some tied up much of their retirement nest-eggs in the bonds. A retired couple living in Spain told Guardian Money: &quot;We would never have gone into this if it was not regulated by the FSA. But while the FSA did not regulate SLS, as an ordinary investor I believed I was protected by Keydata&apos;s regulation. &quot;We would not have touched this had we known the truth. Now we don&apos;t know what we are going to do.&quot; Along with thousands of other savers, they are in desperate need of cash from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. But so far, the FSCS has limited itself to issuing holding statements. The key issue for the compensation scheme is whether Keydata, the UK-regulated company, was legally responsible for the losses. If it concludes there is compensation to pay, it will confirm Keydata &quot;in default&quot; and say how it intends to deal with investors&apos; claims. The FSCS says: &quot;We anticipate being able to confirm whether or not we are likely to be able to help in November, if not before.&quot; One UK-based investor says: &quot;Was Keydata incompetent or negligent? Either way, we should be compensated.&quot; At Keydata, founder Stewart Ford, who lent Elias \u00a34m last year, believes he and his company are also victims. &quot;Perhaps he should have asked more,&quot; says a friend of Ford. &quot;But he has been hit by a well-constructed fraud which deceived other institutions as well. He feels sorrow and contrition, but why should he have been cleverer than others who were also deceived by Elias?&quot; Guardian Money posed several questions to Ford. No response had been received as we went to press."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/14/burberrygroup-londonfashionweek", "sentences": ["Nine new stores have been opened in the last six months, including new outlets in Singapore and Tokyo."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-14T18:00:43Z", "title": "Burberry beats the recession with sales rise", "tags": ["Burberry", "London fashion week", "Handbags", "Recession", "Victoria Beckham", "Business", "Fashion", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Three weeks after Burberry&apos;s triumphant return to London Fashion Week, the luxury goods label has unveiled a recession-defying trading update.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej was admitted to hospital in Bangkok last month with pneumonia. The Royal Household Bureau has issued statements almost daily that his general condition is good, but a lack of detailed information has given weight to rumours that he was seriously ill. That uncertainty was reflected on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which closed down 5.3%, after, at one point, falling 8.2% \u2013 the biggest one-day fall since the global financial crisis began in October last year. On Wednesday, the market fell just over 2%, and trading will be halted tomorrow if shares continue to fall. Bhumibol, the world&apos;s longest-serving monarch, has ruled Thailand for 63 years through 15 coups, 16 constitutions, and 27 changes of prime minister. He is revered as an almost divine figure who has single-handedly restored the glory of a once-moribund monarchy. Bhumibol&apos;s son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is not perceived to have the stature or moral authority of his father, who has risen above partisan politics to become a unifying figure for the country. The 25th statement from the Royal Household Bureau since the king was admitted to hospital on 19 September said his lung infection was clearing up, but he was not yet completely recovered. The committee of royal physicians had requested &quot;that His Majesty remain in hospital in order to improve his nutrition status and to provide continuous rehabilitation therapies&quot;. Portraits of Bhumibol hang prominently in almost every home, business and public place in Thailand, and wristbands reading &quot;long live the king&quot; are now hugely popular. Thai newspapers have been publishing a front-page article every day updating readers on the king&apos;s progress. The length of his stay in hospital \u2013 and the absence of photographs of his convalescence \u2013 have led to speculation that he is seriously ill. Some say the rumours originated in Hong Kong and Singapore. The stock exchange president, Patareeya Benjapolchai, called for calm. &quot;The market would like to warn investors to closely follow announcements from the relevant agencies. They should not panic about rumours.&quot; The finance minister, Korn Chatikavanij, asked investors not to trade on hearsay. The stock market was &quot;very sensitive&quot; and investors should consider all information logically before making decisions, he said. Adding to the anxiety has been the political crisis triggered in 2006 when the army ousted the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, after he was accused of corruption. The struggle has been played out in streets of the capital, where Thaksin&apos;s supporters and opponents have staged a series of mass protests. Last year yellow-shirted anti-Thaksin activists occupied the prime minister&apos;s offices for three months and seized the capital&apos;s two airports for a week. On Saturday red-shirted Thaksin supporters are planning a new protest in Bangkok.Amid the turmoil, Thailand is preparing for its third attempt to host the Asean leaders&apos; summit, which was abandoned when protesters stormed the convention centre. The government has extended its internal security act \u2013 which allows security forces to restrict the public&apos;s movement \u2013 to include old Bangkok, near the parliament building, ahead of Saturday&apos;s rally. The act is already in effect in the southern coastal town of Hua Hin, where ASEAN leaders will meet next week. The conference was first postponed last December, when yellow-clad anti-Thaksin protestors took control of Bangkok&apos;s airport. In April this year, the summit moved to Pattaya, where Thaksin protestors smashed open the doors to the convention centre."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/15/mecca-hotel-against-hajj-spirit", "sentences": ["Raffles, which gave thirsty wanderers the Singapore Sling, is opening a luxury hotel in Mecca offering pilgrims a coffee sommelier, a chocolate room where chefs will prepare bespoke pralines and truffles, and a 24-hour butler service."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-15T18:54:59Z", "title": "Mecca super-hotel to offer spa, butler and a chocolate room", "tags": ["Islam", "Saudi Arabia", "Mecca holidays", "Religion", "World news", "Travel", "Hajj"], "article": "The pilgrimage to Mecca has always involved hardship and sacrifice, whether months spent travelling on foot through barren valleys and sleeping in the open with no shelter from the elements or stripping oneself of earthly trappings. But help is at hand for the pilgrim who cannot bear to be without comfort while executing the fifth pillar of Islam. Raffles, which gave thirsty wanderers the Singapore Sling, is opening a luxury hotel in Mecca offering pilgrims a coffee sommelier, a chocolate room where chefs will prepare bespoke pralines and truffles, and a 24-hour butler service. Undeterred by restrictions on beautifying oneself during the Hajj, the hotel will also have segregated gyms, beauty parlours, grooming salons and a spa. There are strict rules regarding personal hygiene and behaviour during the hajj, and forbidden activities include sex, the cutting of hair and nails and the trimming of beards. These bars are lifted once certain rituals are complete, but Muslims are generally expected to forget worldly thoughts and activities and focus on the divine. Mohammed Arkobi, the general manager of the new hotel, did not explain how a chocolate room and spa would help pilgrims achieve spiritual fulfilment. Nor was he able to comment on how the amenities complied with the ethos of the hajj, which is about simplicity and humility. But he did say that the &quot;comprehensive range of services&quot; were designed to meet the needs of the &quot;discerning&quot; travellers they were targeting. &quot;Ultimately, the hotel&apos;s sophisticated ambience, our range of features and highly personalised service delivery such as those offered through our 24-hour butler service will help to ensure that our residents&apos; overall experience will be enriching.&quot; Arkobi said the hotel was a three-minute walk away from the Grand Mosque, the Masjid al-Haram, and that a &quot;spacious outdoor dining terrace&quot; would provide direct views of it. It is being developed by the Saudi Binladin Company, one of the largest construction firms in the Arab world, which has also been responsible for overseeing the expansion of the holy mosques in Mecca and Medina. The company was set up by Mohammed bin Laden, father of Osama, although the family is now estranged from its most infamous son. Around 4 million people visit Mecca for hajj, with millions more passing through the rest of the year to perform the lesser pilgrimage. Estimates for future numbers vary wildly \u2013 from 10 million to 20 million \u2013 and the landscape of Mecca has undergone a dramatic transformation over the decades to cope with demand. Homes have been bulldozed, mountains flattened and historic sites razed to provide more hotel rooms and amenities. One development that will dominate the skyline and the Grand Mosque is the Makkah Royal Clock Tower, operated by international hoteliers Fairmont, which is majority owned by a company chaired by HRH Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, the Saudi king&apos;s nephew. The tower will be among the tallest in the world, 577 metres (1,893ft) high on completion, and its dimensions, including a clockface measuring 40 metres across that will be visible 10 miles away, make it five times larger than Big Ben. In addition to 1,005 guest rooms, the tower will also house a lunar observation centre and Islamic museum. It lies in the massive Abraj Al Bait complex, part of the King Abdul Aziz endowment project aimed at upgrading the precincts of Mecca and Medina. Mecca&apos;s makeover is alarming international activists, such as Ali al-Ahmed, the director of the Washington-based Institute for Gulf Affairs, a thinktank analysing events and issues in the region. Ahmed, an outspoken critic of the Saudi regime, said many factors were driving the changes. &quot;The al-Sauds want to make Mecca like Dubai, it is a money-making operation. They destroy ancient buildings because they do not want any history other than their own, they see it as competition. They destroy and dispose of artefacts.&quot; He also expressed concern that the arrival of luxury brands would increase the price of a pilgrimage. A 2009 platinum Hajj package from a UK tour operator costs \u00a36,400 for 16 nights full board, based on double occupancy. &quot;By developing Mecca in this way they are making it inaccessible and unaffordable for the majority of Muslims. It will only be for the elite,&quot; Ahmed said. The city&apos;s increasing westernisation was a &quot;perversion of the religion&quot;, encouraging activities that were at odds with the spirit of the hajj, he said. &quot;The Saudis may come across as austere but members of the ruling class have billions of dollars between them \u2013 even the muftis live in palaces with chandeliers.&quot; Development of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina should not come at the expense of religious practice, he said, before turning his attention to the lack of protest from Muslims around the world. &quot;Let&apos;s take Jerusalem as an example. Muslims are outraged when Israelis do something in the Old City, but in Mecca things are being systematically destroyed and nobody is raising an eyebrow. It is a catastrophe.&quot; Raffles Mecca is due to open in April 2010. Turning to Mecca Mecca, or Makkah al Mukarrama, has a population of 1.7m but visitors swell its streets all year round. According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was born in Mecca, and it is said to be the place where Allah&apos;s message was first revealed to him. Each day Muslims from around the world turn to Mecca to pray and, at least once in their lives if they can afford it, they travel there to perform the hajj. At the heart of Mecca&apos;s Grand Mosque is the Kaaba, a large stone structure constituting of a single room with a marble floor. It stands around 60 feet high and each side is approximately 60 feet in length. The Qur&apos;an says that Ibrahim and his son Ishmael were the founders of the Kaaba, building the shrine dedicated to the worship of Allah. Even before its association, the city was still a focal point in the region. In ancient times it was a staging post on the trade route linking the spice producers of the east with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean. Its reputation as a commercial centre continues today. Malls and markets line the city&apos;s roads and alleys, fighting for attention."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/16/david-troostwyk-obituary", "sentences": ["On his death bed, he inquired after the result of the Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-16T16:19:09Z", "title": "David Troostwyk obituary", "tags": ["Art and design", "Culture", "Damien Hirst", "Tracey Emin", "Tate Britain", "Marcel Duchamp", "Royal College of Art"], "article": "David Troostwyk&apos;s voicemail greeted callers: &quot;Hello. Communicate. Goodbye.&quot; It was not friendly, nor was it more than mildly intimidating; merely stripped to essentials, like his art. The message remains, on the phone and in the art, although Troostwyk, who celebrated his 80th birthday in August with a champagne tea party at Tate Britain, has died of lung cancer. His was one of the first and strongest voices in conceptual art, a 1960s form that questioned the notion of the art object. Marcel Duchamp had thrown his hat into the ring in 1917 with a urinal, submitted for exhibition as an art work called Fountain. The resurgence in the 1960s of Duchamp&apos;s idea was a reaction to the cult of personality in art and to the soaring cash value of any art object perceived to be desirable. However, it seems likely that Troost-wyk himself embraced the spartan discipline of conceptualism because he liked things that way: sparse, elegant, ironic. Throughout his life, his art made Duchamp&apos;s look positively gaudy. The irony is that the succeeding generation of gaudy conceptualists, the Damien Hirsts and the Tracey Emins, is the cynosure of the media and rich beyond the dreams of avarice. As long ago as 1970, Caroline Tisdall, then the Guardian&apos;s art critic, picked out Troostwyk as a neglected artist. He\u00a0stayed neglected all his life. The Tate has but one of his works, the Victoria and Albert Museum another. There are local exceptions, especially Matt&apos;s Gallery in Bow, east London, founded by Robin Klassnik and named after his dog, Matt E Mulsion. It opened 30 years ago with a Troostwyk show, consisting of Our Famous Culture, an audio installation of a cod conversation in which an artist insists to his inquisitor that a washing machine is the supreme object of our civilisation, and Supreme Object, a resin cast of a washing machine. Troostwyk had worked in advertising from 1944 to 1947 with the London Display Company, which was heavily involved in cinema commercials, and he retained a fascination with the fantasy world of advertising, propagating lies which are not meant to be wholly believed \u2013 &quot;isn&apos;t that a fair description of art anyway?&quot; he asked. He based his life&apos;s work on shades of truth, completing his career with a sequence of canvases, each with a ghostly white image on a black ground, marking not the presence of an object but the absence. Troostwyk was born in London, the son of a Dutch father who dealt in a haphazard way in radio parts, and a\u00a0Canadian mother. After national service from 1947 to 1949 he studied at\u00a0St Albans School of Art and from 1953 to 1956 at the Royal College of Art. He had shows at many of the key galleries for contemporary art \u2013 Kasmin, the Camden Arts Centre, Angela Flowers, Annely Juda, the Axiom Gallery. He\u00a0worked on words in counterpoint with images, and would develop the same ideas through paintings (always eschewing colour), drawings, audiotapes and books designed by himself or in conjunction with Phil Baines. He taught at the Slade and at Camberwell, where he met and befriended Euan Uglow, the painter of drily schematic female nudes. In Studio International magazine in May 1974 he wrote about Uglow&apos;s best known painting, The Diagonal, which was a nude sitting on a folding wooden chair, stretched out along a diagonal line from the top left corner of the canvas to the bottom right. Uglow&apos;s practice, learned at Camberwell, was to measure by eye and brush all the coordinates of the composition and record them on the canvas with tiny marks. This was meat and drink to Troostwyk. The article was published with a diagram of the composition, minus the model, accompanied by three photographs of her platform, with the chair strung with weights to prevent it being moved while she was off shift, and the marked positions for her feet. Yet these scruffy, strange, obsessive images were warm and moving in a way that Uglow&apos;s painting was not. It would not be too much to say that Troostwyk&apos;s every pencil line, even drawn with a ruler, had an extraordinarily sensuous presence. Since 1983 Troostwyk had dealt under the name of David Koos in fine photographs and old letters. From this came the sequence of white on black paintings of first world war letters called Letters from a British Soldier. There is no text, the shapes just seem to drift. It\u00a0seems perverse to be moved by these images, and yet ... His earthier interests included cricket and formula one racing. On his death bed, he inquired after the result of the Singapore grand prix. He was married three times.

Appeasement itself, Marr says, was popular at every stage: in fact the British public was outraged by Mussolini&apos;s invasion of Ethiopia and would probably have supported measures, such as closing the Suez Canal, to cut him down to size. Furthermore, Marr&apos;s pronouncements about imperial matters are fallible. He states that Edwardians generally assumed that the empire would remain huge, ignoring the intense anxieties about its imminent decline and fall, articulated in Kipling&apos;s &quot;Recessional&quot; and exacerbated by British failures during the Boer war. Marr describes Conrad&apos;s Heart of Darkness as &quot;the most powerful fictional denunciation in English of the evil of colonialism&quot;. Yet what is striking about this nightmarish novella is its profound ambiguity, its expressions of horror at African &quot;barbarism&quot; as well as European &quot;civilisation&quot;. Finally, Marr repeats the hoary myth that Singapore fell to the Japanese because it was not defended to the landward side. Nevertheless his account of British political and social life has the virtues of its vices. They deserve to be celebrated. The book is lively, readable and engaging. The four long chapters contain vivid character studies and colourful vignettes, some of cinematic brilliance \u2013 the sections on music halls and early British films are especially excellent. Marr has an enviable ability to unravel complex issues and expound them in simple terms. He possesses a sharp radical edge and often goes to the heart of the matter. If many of his quotations and anecdotes are familiar, most bear repeating. He fires off some cheap shots, suggesting, for example, that the public fornication that took place after the 1918 armistice was a national tribute to the Goat, Lloyd George. But Marr can also be genuinely funny. He pens a hilarious sketch of Lord Willoughby de Broke, who was not more than 200 years behind the times when he opposed Lloyd George&apos;s People&apos;s Budget in the House of Lords, a chamber so idle and ill-attended that when peers voted they would &quot;cackle as if they had laid an egg&quot;. HG Wells makes a characteristic appearance, copulating in the open on a copy of the Times containing an article by Mrs Humphrey Ward about the immorality of popular novelists. Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, discusses spiritualism, operates by instinct and tells a colleague that he can walk through walls. The BBC governors instruct Eric Gill, carving the figures of Prospero and Ariel on the front of the new Broadcasting House, to reduce the size of the latter&apos;s genitalia. Marr has an acute eye for the kind of detail that puts the past in perspective. Thus the suffragette Frances Swiney asserted that male sexual desire was pathological rather than natural and that sperm was toxic. Many Edwardians carried firearms, and in 1913 Ben Tillett, the dockers&apos; leader, told cheering trade unionists that strikers had a right to use them. During the first world war British tommies were on average five inches shorter than their officers. To a policeman who stopped his speeding Bentley and told him that he might kill someone, Air Marshal &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris retorted: &quot;Young man, I kill thousands of people every night.&quot; General Montgomery said that the British army was unfit not only to fight a first-class war but to take part in a realistic exercise. Marr&apos;s analyses are lucid, but less illuminating. He sums up historical debates adeptly, condensing the arguments for and against General Haig, for example, or assessing the impact of the blitz on civilians. Like the medium of television itself, however, his interpretations tend inexorably towards the superficial. For instance, he acknowledges that there is no reasonable way of marking the border between the 1920s and 30s, but proposes one anyway: &quot;the rambling stopped and the marching began.&quot; Similarly, his conclusion that Hitler&apos;s war produced a modern, democratic Britain in which empire had no place is far too glib. Herbert Morrison proved the point graphically when expressing the views of the new Labour government. He and his colleagues were &quot;great friends with the jolly old empire&quot;, and to grant self-government to backward people would be like giving a child of 10 &quot;a latchkey, a bank account and a shotgun&quot;.

Balco n, acronym for the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, a bespoke steroid factory exposed in 2003 as a production house of tetrahydrogestrinone (also known as THG), the steroid supplied to cheating sprinters Dwain Chambers and Marion Jones. Chambers was banned from Olympic competition for life, while Jones forfeited five Olympic medals and served a jail sentence. &quot;The Olympic Games are a\u00a0fraud,&quot; Balco&apos;s founder Victor Conte said. &quot;The whole history of the games is just full of corruption, cover-up, performance-enhancing drug use.&quot; He is now writing a book about how to save sport from drug use. baton, collapsible n weapon used by Shane Stant to strike the knee of ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, forcing her withdrawal from the 1994 US Figure Skating Championship. Kerrigan&apos;s skating rival, Tonya Harding, admitted helping to cover up the attack, and was later banned from competition before enjoying a brief career as a boxer. birth certificate n allegedly falsified by the family of baseball player Danny Almonte, a &quot;12-year-old&quot; Little League phenomenon who burst onto the scene in 2001. Almonte and his team, &quot;The Baby Bombers&quot;, won everything from the Little League World Series to the keys to New York City, before the pitcher was revealed to be two years older than records stated, and thus ineligible to compete in Little League. Ben Johnson n, proper [Fig 1] Canadian sprinter and trailblazing steroid cheat. Busted for using Stanozolol, an anabolic steroid, after winning gold in the Seoul Olympics in 1988, Johnson became the first high-profile athlete to be stripped of an Olympic medal for drug use. Johnson later worked as a football coach for the son of Colonel Gaddafi, but had a portion of his fee for these services stolen by pickpockets in Rome, who outran him. boiled sweets n, pl sucked by cricketers in order to sweeten their saliva, the saliva then (mysteriously) more effective when used to polish the ball and enhance its swing. No player has been officially charged with the crime, but in 2004 Rahul Dravid of India was fined after he rubbed a well-sucked lolly directly on to the ball. Other methods of ball tampering include roughing up the leather with sandpaper and raising the seam with a bottle top. Boris Onishchenko n, proper Russian pentathlete and technologically advanced cheat, who, during the &apos;76 Olympics, competed in the fencing discipline with a special sword that allowed him to score points at will. He was discovered, disqualified and lived out his life as either a\u00a0taxi driver or a Siberian exile, depending on which reports you believe. brandy n one of the earliest recorded performance stimulants, laced with strychnine and consumed during the 1904 Olympic marathon by American Thomas Hicks. Hicks won, but collapsed at the finishing line and was not revived for hours. clear, the n street name for tetrahydrogestrinone; see Balco. collision, intentional n a technique successfully deployed by Michael Schumacher in 1994 (when the German F1 driver drove Damon Hill off the road, costing Hill the championship) but less successfully in 1997 (when he tried to do the same to Jacques Villeneuve and missed, costing himself the championship). See also crash, intentional. cooking spray, nonstick n applied to the uniforms of three American footballers during a Sacramento college match in 2002, in the hope that it would make them difficult to hold on to (see also petroleum jelly). The trio were caught when a photographer snapped them greasing up on the sidelines. corking vb inserting cork into the interior of a baseball bat, to make it lighter (and thus more swingable) without reducing its hitting power. In 1994, Albert Belle of the Cleveland Indians was accused of corking and a team-mate tried to switch the soon-to-be-investigated bat with an untainted alternative; but he submitted a bat bearing another team-mate&apos;s signature on the handle, and Belle was suspended. The most public exposure occurred in 2003, when the bat belonging to Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs shattered in the middle of a game, spraying the field with bits of cork. Interestingly, a 2007 study found that corked bats absorbed more kinetic energy than uncorked bats, and didn&apos;t technically hit the ball any further as a result. crash, intentional n convoluted cheating, but cheating nonetheless, F1 driver Nelson Piquet Jr intentionally drove his Renault into a wall at the 2007 Singapore GP to aid team-mate Fernando Alonso&apos;s race strategy. capsules, blood n, pl purchased at a joke shop in Clapham Junction by Harlequins physio Steph Brennan and used during a game in April 2009 to force an advantageous substitution. Suspicions were initially raised about the colour of the &quot;blood&quot; coming from Quins winger Tom Williams&apos;s mouth, and a full-scale investigation was launched when television cameras caught Williams winking as he walked towards the sidelines. Arguably the most egregious (not to mention hammy) incident of cheating in the sport&apos;s history, it will forever be known as &quot;bloodgate&quot;; for other &quot;gate&quot; scandals, see gate (suffix). diuretics n, pl drugs such as hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride that make people urinate more frequently, thus the ideal post-steroid cleanser for the cheating athlete who is worried about an approaching test; they are also used by over-tubby athletes in sports where weight limits must be met. Testing positive for a diuretic alone is enough to raise the suspicions of officials, as Shane Warne discovered in 2003 when he took a dieting pill (losing four kilos) and was banned for a year; he said he had wanted to look good for his mum on TV. diving vb 1. in football falling theatrically to deceive officials (common); see foreign player/domestic player paradox, the; Jurgen Klinsmann. 2. in rugby falling theatrically to deceive officials (rare); see great dive to victory, the. 3. in boxing falling theatrically to deceive officials (at the behest of gangsters); in 1972, Detroit boxer Jim Christopher said he pretended to have been knocked out by heavyweight champion George Chuvalo in order to &quot;get home alive&quot; after a visit from a\u00a0hoodlum to his hotel room before the fight. discus, underweight n an official accused British thrower Perris Wilkins at an athletics meet in 1999 of having a discus that weighed less than the regulation 2kg. UK Athletics held an investigation, though no charges were brought. (Wilkins was later banned for doping offences.) See also corking. Donald Crowhurst n, proper English sailor who entered a competition to circumnavigate the globe in 1968 and seemed to be winning, according to his radio reports. But Crowhurst, inexperienced and in a leaky trimaran, had been sailing round the South Atlantic for three months and faked his log books, which ended in thousands of words of confessions and deranged philosophy. On 10 July 1969 his boat was discovered, drifting. Crowhurst was never seen alive again. drive serve n contentious method of serving in badminton with the racket marginally (but still illegally) above the waist, as deployed by Aussie player Ashley Brehaut in the 2006 Commonwealth Games. &quot;You&apos;re a fucking cheat, Brehaut,&quot; shouted an opponent from New Zealand at 19-19 in the deciding game, for which he was docked a point. The Australians then won the game 21-19. drugs, performance enhancing n, pl [Fig 2] the substances that make up the World Anti-Doping Agency&apos;s &quot;Prohibited List&quot;, including: amphetamines; anabolic steroids; caffeine; ephedrine; ethanol; fencanfamine; furosemide; human growth hormone; mescocarde; methenolone; nandrolone; phenylpropanolamine; propanolol; strychnine; testosterone. drugs, performance diminishing n, pl in 2007, a plot was uncovered to fire darts loaded with tranquillisers into the bellies of certain horses at the Happy Valley racecourse in Hong Kong. epo n, abbrev erythropoietin, a hormone that can be injected to boost production of red blood cells, enabling the body to carry more oxygen to the heart. Believed to be responsible for dozens of deaths in cycling, where the drug was used almost as soon as it was in clinical trials, it has also been the major player in the Tour de France scandals of recent years. Eagle Farm n Australian racecourse famed for an incident when gelding Bold Personality was substituted for Fine Cotton in a 1984 race. Bold Personality&apos;s dyed coat and painted feet had the crowd shouting &quot;Ringer!&quot; as he was taken to be weighed. face clutch, the n ham-acting technique employed by footballers to make clear to officials that they have been struck, punched, touched, or nearly touched in the face by an opponent. Notable examples include: Slaven Bilic for Croatia in World Cup &apos;98, after an imagined blow from France&apos;s Laurent Blanc, ensuring the defender got a red card and missed the final; Milan&apos;s Brazilian goalkeeper Dida, after being nearly-but-not-quite slapped by a pitch invader at Celtic; and Dida&apos;s compatriot Rivaldo, who clawed at his face as if it were coated in napalm after being struck on the thigh by a football (the ball was kicked in anger by Turkey&apos;s Hakan \u00dcnsal, subsequently sent off). See also firework injuries (fake). finger signals n, pl used by bridge team-mates Terence Reese and Boris Schapiro to communicate during a world championship match in 1965: two fingers held indicated two hearts held, for instance, and two fingers held apart indicated five. Officials cottoned on, and the pair were dropped from the British team. The world ruling body found them guilty; the British Bridge league cleared them. firework injuries (fake) n, pl Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas was banned for life when he fell to the ground, in 1989, clutching his head and claiming to have been struck by a firework from the crowd: he had cut his own face with a concealed razor blade. Chile were barred from the 1994 World Cup for the deception. fog n craftily used by (aptly named) jockey &quot;Sly&quot; Carmouche to gain victory at a Louisiana racetrack in 1990; Carmouche let the field charge past him into the fog, then hung around for the pack to come round behind him before crossing the finish line first. following wind n aid to javelin throwers, as experienced by Russian competitors at the 1980 Moscow Olympics: every time they were about to throw the large doors of the Olimpiisky stadium were held open, to provide an advantageous breeze. foreign player/domestic player paradox, the n a difficulty encountered when determining whether a tumbling footballer collapsed to the ground with an intention to deceive or not to deceive the referee, generally decided by whether he is English (Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney) or not (Didier Drogba, Cristiano Ronaldo, Eduardo). -gate suffix as in bloodgate, crashgate, Hansiegate, grannygate, liargate, skategate, spygate, toiletgate. genealogy, fictional n rearranging the branches of a family tree in order to claim eligibility for a national team, as in 2000 when Wales fielded two New Zealanders in its rugby union side. gene-doping n the potentially undetectable alteration of an athlete&apos;s genetic make-up to render them a better sportsperson; still in its infancy but considered by many to be the future of cheating. gloves, weighted n, pl [Fig 3] with plaster of paris, which was hidden in a talcum powder can and sprinkled over the wet hands of boxer Jack Dempsey before a match in 1919. His plaster-hardened fists allowed Dempsey to beat his much larger opponent Jess Willard, breaking his cheek, jaw and several ribs in the process. The ruse was only revealed in 1964, when Dempsey&apos;s coach told all to Sports Illustrated. &quot;Ridiculous!&quot; retorted Dempsey. Willard said, &quot;I knew those gloves were loaded\u2026&quot; goalposts, moving the vb 1. figurative for changing the rules after a contest has begun. 2. actual method deployed by Swedish goalkeeper Kim Christensen during a match between IFK Gothenburg and Orebro in September 2009. He was caught on camera hoisting his goalposts from their foundations and moving them an inch inward on either side. He kept a clean sheet. eye gouging vb 1. in Mixed Martial Arts one of the few manoeuvres that qualifies as cheating. 2. in rugby illegal but common method of intimidation, as employed on British Lions&apos; winger Luke Fitzgerald by South African flanker Schalk Burger. Burger was only sin-binned by the referee, but banned for eight weeks after the game. grunting, excessive vb introduced to tennis by Monica Seles, developed by Serena Williams and recently perfected by Michelle Larcher de Brito, a 16-year-old Portuguese player whose arena-shaking grunts and shrieks proved so off-putting to opponents in 2009 that a Wimbledon umpire had to request she quieten them. handball, deliberate n to stop a goal in football (see shot-in-the-heart gambit, the) and occasionally to score one, as in the case of Lionel Messi for Barcelona, whose sly punch into the net against Espanyol in 2007 was spookily reminiscent of compatriot Maradona (see Hands of). Hands of prefix as in &quot;Hand of Back&quot;, Neil Back&apos;s illegal swipe of the ball in the 2002 Heineken Cup final that secured Leicester&apos;s victory over Munster; &quot;Hand of God&quot;, Maradona&apos;s punched goal for Argentina against England in the 1986 World Cup. great dive to victory, the n popular name of Andy Haden&apos;s simulated tumble in a 1978 match against Wales that won the All Blacks a game-winning penalty in the dying minutes. Henry Hill n, proper the real-life Goodfella who arranged, in 1978, for basketball players at Boston College to &quot;point shave&quot; \u2013 or miss shots, deliberately, at certain times \u2013 to aid gambling gangsters. Hill said he first snared the players with offers of free booze, drugs and prostitutes. Hitler Youth n, collective organisation that coerced high jumper Dora (later known as Hermann) Ratjen to bind his genitals and compete as a woman in the 1936 Olympics. He finished fourth. inhaler, Vicks n sinus unblocker used under doctor&apos;s advice by Scottish skier Alain Baxter that led him to be stripped of his 2002 Winter Olympics bronze. Baxter was cleared of any wrongdoing but was never able to regain the bronze.

They were stripped of their gold after being revealed as fully able-minded. itching powder n the earliest \u2013 and, in today&apos;s light, most naive \u2013 method of cheating in the Tour de France: the irritant was said to have been sprinkled in riders&apos; shorts by mischievous rivals at the second Tour in 1904. Jurgen Klinsmann n, proper the worst diver in football history according to a recent poll, but his most significant contribution to the sport&apos;s culture may have been his invention of an ironic belly dive as a goal celebration in the 1990s. jet fuel n replicated and pumped into a Nascar racing car before the Daytona 500 in 2007. The offending team, Michael Waltrip Racing, were expelled. Manfred Ewald n, proper East German minister of sport in the 70s and 80s whose enthusiasm for doping makes Ben Johnson, Marion Jones et al look like teenagers dabbling with alcopops. Ewald was convicted in 2000 of arranging the doping of more than 100 athletes, in a state-sponsored system described as &quot;&apos;one of the largest pharmacological experiments in history&quot;. match fixing vb rigging a sporting result, generally to the benefit of gamblers. The career of South African cricketer Hansie Cronje was ruined when he was discovered to have taken money to fix matches for a high-paying Indian betting syndicate. marathon fakers n, pl including Mexican politician Roberto Madrazo, disqualified from the 2007 Berlin Marathon when he posted a 15km section time of 21 minutes \u2013 20 minutes faster than the world record. Others include Rosie Ruiz, who jumped out of the crowd near the finish line to &quot;win&quot; the 1980 Boston Marathon, and Fred Lorz, passenger in a car for 11 miles of the 1904 Olympic marathon in St Louis \u2013 a fact only discovered after he had been presented with his gold medal and had his picture taken with President Theodore Roosevelt. mighty mice, aka Schwarzenegger mice n, pl rodents genetically altered by American scientist Lee Sweeney in the late 90s with muscles 50% stronger than their peers. Sweeney&apos;s experiments excited the interest of many athletes; one coach even asked him to inject his junior American football team. nudity n the earliest anti-cheating technique, employed at the original Olympic Games in ancient Greece when athletes competed without clothes to eliminate the possibility of unfair advantage. petroleum jelly, aka Vaseline n [Fig 5] following the same principle as the American footballers who soused themselves with cooking spray, nonstick, mixed martial arts fighter Georges St Pierre was rubbed down with Vaseline during a break in his match against BJ Penn in 2009. In defeat, Penn&apos;s trainer insisted that the petroleum jelly constituted cheating, since St Pierre was harder to hold on to while they grappled. The MMA community is divided. penalties, questionable n, pl awarded to lower-league Paderborn in a German Cup match against Hamburg in 2004. Two penalties alerted officials to referee Robert Hoyzer, who had been instructed by Croatian hoodlums to make Paderborn win 4-2. He was banned from refereeing for life. piano wire n tied by paralysed athletes around their scrotum, in order to raise blood pressure and stimulate performance \u2013 a\u00a0practice nicknamed &quot;boosting&quot;. recordings, audio n, pl damning radio transmissions between Lewis Hamilton and McLaren sporting director Dave Ryan which proved that they had lied to prevent another driver, Jarno Trulli, sealing third place at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix (see liargate). &quot;Say it ain&apos;t so, Joe&quot; phrase The only popular saying to have been born from a cheating incident, in this case that of the 1919 Chicago White Sox who intentionally lost the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds as part of a mob deal. The &quot;Black Sox&quot; scandal blighted the career of the Sox&apos;s famous batter &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson, and prompted a fan to utter the enduring line. 7-Up n, proper lemonade-like soft drink used, according to the coach of defeated Scottish opponents, by Canadian curlers to doctor their brooms during the 1991 World Championships in Canada. shot-in-the-heart gambit, the n when a footballer falls to the ground clutching a body part to avert accusations of handball. Deployed to no effect (other than derision) by Newcastle&apos;s Steven Taylor in 2005; watch it at tinyurl.com/taylorbullet Sergei Voynov n, proper arguably the least subtle drugs cheat exposed to date. The Uzbek athletics coach was caught at the Sydney Olympics trying to bring along 15 vials of human growth hormone, inside a jar labelled with the giant letters: HGH. sheep testicles n consumed by athletes in ancient Greece to enhance performance, thanks to the testosterone they contained. sex n another form of testosterone-booster, at least according to American sprinter Dennis Mitchell, who claimed in 1989 that suspiciously high levels of the steroid in a\u00a0doping test came from enjoying conjugal pleasures with his wife &quot;at least four times&quot; the night before. The IAAF was not so easily convinced, and banned him for two\u00a0years. toilet breaks n, pl a cunning but completely legal way to disrupt an opponent&apos;s momentum in tennis and even more ruthlessly manipulated in chess. In the past decade, several amateur players have been caught in the loo consulting miniature chess computers (in one case a cheater was caught when an official stood on the bowl in a neighbouring stall and looked over the dividing wall). At a higher level, the game was rocked in 2006 by accusations that the world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik was visiting the toilet &quot;suspiciously&quot; often, up to 50 times a game, but no wrongdoing was proved. Tony&apos;s web n mesh sewn between the legs of NHL goalkeeper Tony Esposito during the 1969 season, to catch and repel pucks that went through his legs; the web was promptly made illegal. twin swapping vb as deployed by Merseyside twins Nazim and Zabid Mohammed in a league cricket match this year, when bowler Nazim swapped with batsman Zahid at the end of an innings. A life ban was imposed after discovery of the ruse \u2013 Zahid, unlike Nazim, was left-handed. Also attempted by the Motsoeneng twins, Sergio and Arnold, who shared the running of a 55-mile Comrades ultra-marathon in South Africa in 1999, then had to return their gold medal. underarm bowling vb cricket delivery that prohibits the scoring of a six at a crucial time in the game; see Trevor Chappell&apos;s last-ball underarm against New Zealand in 1981 \u2013 &quot;the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket,&quot; according to the Kiwi PM at the\u00a0time. urine, borrowed n cyclist Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the 1978 Tour de France after submitting a piddle sample that wasn&apos;t his; when the time came to deliver the sample he brought it forth by &quot;pumping his elbow in and out as if playing a set of bagpipes&quot; (officials became suspicious at that point). vote swapping vb A French judge admitted to being &quot;influenced&quot; to favour Russia&apos;s figure skaters at the 2002 Winter Olympics, resulting in a Russian gold. Second-placed Canada were later awarded a duplicate gold medal. Wenger goggles n [Fig 6] apocryphal vision-blockers worn by Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne, enabling him to conveniently fail to see any infringement of the rules by his own players, freeing him from discussions about cheating in post-match interviews. WG Grace n, proper 19th-century cricketer as famous for his sharp practice as his batting, who once refused to leave the crease even when he was given out (&quot;They&apos;ve come to see me bat, not you umpire&quot;). Grace even cheated at the coin-toss, when he would call out &quot;The Lady&quot; (the sovereign had Queen Victoria on one side and Britannia on the other). zoom lens n employed in the illegal videotaping of rival teams&apos; practice sessions.

Uncompromisingly bulky, unmistakably odoriferous, and inevitably messy, it&apos;s the kind of food that you probably don&apos;t want to pick for a first date. In fact, it&apos;s definitely something that&apos;s best enjoyed in private, or in the company of the sort of friends who aren&apos;t put off their conversational stroke by a smear of salsa on the nose or a scrap of coriander sprouting from the teeth. Unfortunately, last week I found myself on the bus in possession of this fine foodstuff. I didn&apos;t intend to eat it on board \u2013 I&apos;d relied upon the usual delays to give me ample time to enjoy it at the stop, but for once the number 38 was on time, pulling up just as I was breaking through the tangy rice to the savoury slow-cooked pork beneath. I was torn: to pause, and risk my beautiful lunch turning into a sodden, lukewarm mess, or continue in the sure and certain knowledge that I was offending my fellow passengers, a few of whom had already given my foil-wrapped companion the eye.  People eat on public transport all the time, I told myself. It&apos;s no big deal. I assumed the hunched posture common to all seasoned burrito eaters not in possession wipe-clean clothing, and took a furtive bite. And then another. And a lump of guacamole dropped on to my jumper, and I was miserably conscious of a piece of rice adhering to my cheek, and I realised that not only was I guilty of not giving this wonderful lunch the respect it deserved, I wasn&apos;t even enjoying it.  I thought of all the times I&apos;d rolled my eyes at the perfume of fried chicken on the night bus, or had a half-empty drinks can roll stickily down the top deck to collide with my shoe as the vehicle braked sharply. I remembered moving away from people who&apos;d boarded the Intercity with a burger, and once watching a woman eat a bowl of cereal on an early tube into work. And I wondered, is it ever acceptable to eat on public transport?  In an ideal world we&apos;d all have time to sit down and eat a proper lunch or dinner at the table (or at the kitchen worktop, or on our laps, as the mood takes us), but for some, going from job to job and only home to sleep, the daily commute is the only chance to refuel. For these hard-working sorts, eating on the hoof is a necessity \u2013 and as long as they bring napkins, take their litter with them and refrain from hard-boiled eggs on hot days, they shouldn&apos;t be condemned for it. Children are also special cases: sometimes they just need to eat, and most of us would rather see a toddler massacre a digestive than listen to the same child wail for 10 stops. But for the rest of us, surely it&apos;s better to wait and enjoy our meal a little bit more, a little bit later? Eating in public might not be taboo these days, but, as with snogging or filing your nails, that doesn&apos;t make it any more pleasant for everyone else. What do you think \u2013 is digging into anything more substantial than a bag of sweets on the bus inconsiderate, or a fact of life? Should we follow Singapore&apos;s example, and ban eating and drinking on public transport altogether?

When Unesco approved Indonesia&apos;s bid to include this cloth in its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage, the Indonesian media played it up as a victory over Malaysia where there had previously been efforts to patent batik designs. Meanwhile, Thailand and Cambodia had been wrangling over the ownership of the Preah Vihear temple located at their borders \u2013 a dispute that was also born from a Unesco decision last year to designate the ancient Buddhist temple as a world heritage site for Cambodia (to the chagrin of Thai leaders who are now appealing against this decision). Already, clashes between Cambodian and Thai troops have caused fatalities on both sides. To downplay Asean&apos;s culture war as trivial is unwise. This conflict threatens the regional grouping&apos;s unity, forcing its member states to uphold a state of continuing socio-political, even military, tension that is almost akin to the cold war. The skirmishes between Thai and Cambodian troops and the near-violent spat between Indonesians and Malaysians signal a disturbing trend. So too are the reactions of Singaporean bloggers if one considers the results of a survey commissioned by the Asean Foundation last year which found that Singaporean youths are the least likely among their peers in the 10-member grouping to consider themselves Asean citizens. To bridge the gaping cultural divide, Asean needs to instil a much-needed paradigm shift that will see its people define &quot;culture&quot; beyond mere superficialities. Instead of being fixated on a distinct dish, dress or dance, Southeast Asians have to start seeing culture from a socio-historical perspective. Given that the region was once part of the Silk Road where traders from all over Asia had moved freely, any instances of cultural heritage are likely to be a meshing of many. As founding members of the grouping, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore are well-placed to contribute to this undertaking. Taking the case of multicultural Singapore, this would mean capitalising on the notion of hybridised cultures to encourage endeavours that break down racial barriers such as in school public performances where Chinese pupils dance to Indian bhangra music or Malay students perform the Chinese opera, among others. There are other ways of instilling such a culture shock. To mitigate the spread of parochialism in future generations, Asean could develop an educational programme highlighting its sense of shared history that could be adapted by schools in the different member-states. The ideal curriculum should capture discourses that not only decentres the idea of a fixed identity but promotes the view that culture is evolutionary and not static. Hence, this month&apos;s forum by historians from Malaysia and Indonesia to suss out common cultural links is laudable. Or Asean leaders could consider setting up a committee of experts to rule on cultural disputes between member-states. Professing multiculturalism as its motto, this committee should also advise the Unesco which had inadvertently fuel Asean&apos;s culture war when it ruled in favour of Indonesia and Cambodia on the batik and the Preah Vehar temple respectively. After all, such a committee would gel well with Asean secretary-general Surin Pitsuwan&apos;s promise of focusing on culture as the hitherto ignored third pillar of the regional grouping after economic and defence when he first took over last year. Whatever Asean chooses to do, it needs doing soon. As the Indonesian invasion threat of Malaysia suggests, the region&apos;s culture vultures are already hovering on the horizon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/19/somali-pirates-hickjack-chinese-ship", "sentences": ["A drop in winds north of the Seychelles has seen pirates concentrating there in recent weeks, seizing ships from Spain and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-19T21:05:21Z", "title": "Somali pirates capture Chinese ship and 25 crew", "tags": ["Piracy at sea", "Somalia", "China", "World news", "Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Somali pirates operating 700 nautical miles from shore captured a Chinese bulk carrier today in a raid highlighting their determination to outfox foreign naval patrols in the Indian Ocean.

The flamboyant former Renault team principal, effectively banned from motor sport for life by a World Motor Sport Council Ruling last month for ordering Nelson Piquet Jr to deliberately crash during last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix, revealed his intention to appeal in the French courts over the weekend. The Football League said today in a statement that Briatore, who has a 54% stake in the west London club, met with the League chairman, Lord Mawhinney, on Friday to explain the background to his decision to attempt to overturn the ban and win damages from the FIA. In its judgment, the WMSC banned Briatore from any FIA-sanctioned events and stopped him from managing any licensed drivers. Under the Football League&apos;s fit and proper persons test, any individual banned by another recognised sporting authority is forbidden from owning one of its clubs. But the Football League board has been fearful throughout of the legal consequences of banning Briatore before the appeal process is exhausted. The Italian, who claimed at the weekend that the &quot;FIA has been used as a tool to exact vengeance on behalf of one man&quot; and has described the penalty as a &quot;legal absurdity&quot;, will have his case heard on 24 November after a preliminary hearing yesterday found it worthy of full hearing.

The QPR situation is just one of three pressing ownership issues facing the Football League board as it attempts to enforce the fit and proper persons test it introduced in 2005. Notts County are expected to provide further information to the board in the coming days about its ultimate offshore owners, while the League is also seeking more information from Leeds United about its ownership structure.

It&apos;s a fantastic result, any way you look at it. WALL-E had reached \u00a38.93m at the same stage in its life cycle but, having been released in the heat of summer, faced much more competition for audiences from rival blockbusters. But Pixar&apos;s previous feature, Ratatouille, landed in the UK in October just like Up has done, and managed to rake in an almost identical amount in its first 10 days as WALL-E (\u00a38.98m).  Up is now more than 50% ahead of both its predecessors at the second-weekend stage, and is only the second release this year (the other being Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) to manage two weekends at \u00a35m-plus. Considering that schools don&apos;t even break up for half-term until Friday \u2013 after which Up should enjoy an especially rich period \u2013 the film is clearly set for more good news.\u00a0The impact on the other family film this October half-term \u2013 Fantastic Mr Fox opens on Friday \u2013 is hard to read. On the one hand, Up will clearly be a formidable opponent. On the other, so many families will already have seen Up by Friday, when the Roald Dahl adaptation opens, audiences might well be ready to line up for another cinema outing. All will be revealed in seven days&apos; time.\u00a0The runner-upThe top new release is Couples Retreat. The ensemble comedy took \u00a31.83m including \u00a3478,000 in previews. That number compares unfavourably with Forgetting Sarah Marshall \u2013 Universal&apos;s previous holiday-island comedy \u2013 which opened in April 2007 with \u00a32.14m including \u00a3394,000 in previews. It also fails to match the debuts of Vince Vaughn&apos;s previous three comedy leading roles: The Break-Up, Fred Claus and Four Christmases all opened in the \u00a31.9-2.4m range. The UK result is also out of kilter with the US: Couples Retreat debuted Stateside with $34.3m, which pointed to a UK opening around \u00a33.4m. (On the other hand, American comedies rarely live up to the rule-of-thumb arithmetic used to compare the relative success of films in the two markets. Not even The Hangover, which has been a huge UK hit, has taken a number in sterling that is 10% of the US dollar gross.) The triumph over adversitySaddled with a wildly uncommercial title and the mid-shoot death of its most marketable element, Terry Gilliam&apos;s The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus has done well to get this far. Drafting in Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell as substitutes for Heath Ledger gave the film an abundance of marquee names, but few commentators were betting the farm on a box-office bonanza. Thanks to committed marketing support from local distributor Lionsgate, The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus defied decidedly mixed reviews to post opening takings of \u00a3906,000. That&apos;s very similar to the debut of Gilliam&apos;s bigger-budget Brothers Grimm (\u00a3920,000), although still behind 12 Monkeys (\u00a31.32m) 13 years ago. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas began its life with \u00a3206,000 from 117 screens: proof that the combination of Gilliam plus A-list star (Johnny Depp) isn&apos;t necessarily potent at the box office. The Diwali glutThree Bollywood and two Tamil new releases competed for audiences over Diwali. Top of the pile was lavishly budgeted thriller Blue, which boasted an appealing cast including Akshay Kumar, Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty, Lara Dutta, Katrina Kaif and Kylie Minogue. The Caribbean-set film cost $21m, reportedly India&apos;s most expensive film to date, and grossed \u00a3216,000 including \u00a317,500 in previews. Next came Main Aur Mrs Khanna, which likewise focused on NRI (non-resident Indian) characters. The love story, set in Melbourne and Singapore, stars Kareena Kapoor and Salman Khan, and grossed \u00a389,000. Comedy All the Best \u2013 also starring Blue&apos;s Sanjay Dutt \u2013 did worst of the Bollywood flicks, while Tamil titles Aadhavan and Peraanmai took wildly different amounts in limited release (see Other Openers, below). The futureOpening the Friday before Halloween, Saw VI will be hoping to repeat the performance of the previous entries in the franchise \u2013 numbers IV and V both debuted in the \u00a32.4-2.5m range. Meanwhile Fantastic Mr Fox hopes to take advantage of the half-term holiday, targeting families that have already seen Up, as well as adults attracted to Wes Anderson&apos;s quirky sensibilities. Universal&apos;s Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&apos;s Assistant is an unknown quantity. Eco documentary The Cove should kick new life into the arthouse market, which lately has been dominated by such holdover titles as Fish Tank (which just edged past \u00a3500,000) and The September Issue (\u00a3400,000).

Barclays closed 18.3p lower at 363.75p as Qatar sold \u00a31.36bn worth of shares in the bank at 360p each, giving it a profit of around \u00a3600m. The move immediately revived last week&apos;s speculation that the sovereign wealth fund might raise its 26% stake in J Sainsbury, or perhaps even make a full bid. Sainsbury shares jumped 17.7p to 347.8p on the suggestion, although traders continue to have their doubts. Last week the Qataris were said to be prepared to offer 420p a share for Sainsbury, and had even approached the Sainsbury family about buying their 15% stake, although the tale was downplayed as the day went on. Meanwhile PartyGaming plunged 44.4p to 240.1p as co-founder Anurag Dikshit raised \u00a3188m by selling two thirds of his shares in the online gaming group at 250p each. Dikshit was recently fined a similar amount after pleading guilty to an online betting charge in the US, thus finally settling his dispute with the Department of Justice. There was some talk he might sell his remaining shares in the not too distant future. Analyst James Hollins at Daniel Stewart said:  [The sale] represents 18.2% of the group&apos;s share capital and reduces Dikshit&apos;s holding by 66% from 27.6% to 9.4%. As far as we know, he has been keen to progress with a number of charitable and business activities back in India and so the reduced exposure to PartyGaming, with a net share sale income of around \u00a3188m, will allow him to do this.  In our opinion, he has clearly decided to use the strong recent run to partially cash in and we would advise buying on today&apos;s drop, with the shares benefitting from an increased free float.  We suspect that the share sale does not relate to selling down holdings with the explicit intention of increasing the likelihood of PartyGaming securing a US licence as PartyGaming still has two key shareholders that have not settled (Ruth Parasol and Russ Deleon, with 28% between them) and Dikshit is, for now, retaining 9%.  With a near 16% decline, PartyGaming was the leading faller in the FTSE 250. The biggest loser in the leading index was search software specialist Autonomy, which fell 138p to \u00a314.57 after disappointing third quarter figures. The company said the costs of investing in new products had led to a fall in its gross margins, and an earnings per share figure of 20 cents was at the bottom end of analysts&apos; forecasts. Overall the market took another pause for breath, with the FTSE 100 down 38.14 points at 5243.40 and the FTSE 250 60.36 points lower at 9486.28. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said:  Deals are being done and the market is being propped up by a little a bit of buying here and a little bit of selling here, however the overriding focus is on the earnings season, which has been mixed to say the least. Ever since the Dow reached the infamous 10,000 level equity markets have looked a smidgeon over-bought \u2013 so, for now, investors are biding their time and waiting for the next catalyst to show that the bull run isn&apos;t over.  Among the other fallers Xstrata - fresh from abandoning its plans to merge with Anglo American - lost 25p to \u00a310.02 after some mixed production figures. Copper production in the third quarter was down 10% due to lower ore grades, but its other key commodity, coal, rose 9% helped by acquisitions. The company also warned that the strong rand - compared to the weak dollar in which commodities are priced - was putting margins under pressure. Charles Kernot at Evolution Securities issued a sell note on the business, saying:  We believe that the market is failing to take account of the negative effects of operating currency strength which, as Xstrata itself points out, detracts from US dollar commodity price strength.  BHP Billiton dipped 21.5p to \u00a318.26 ahead of production numbers due tomorrow. John Meyer at Fairfax commented:  Expect a strong performance in iron ore and related bulk commodities led by continuing demand growth out of China and some impact from Chinese/Rio Tinto situation. Rio Tinto&apos;s Beijing marketing staff are mainly working in Singapore following the detention of some staff in Beijing on charges of procuring state secrets. BHP&apos;s ongoing presence in Beijing is helpful in its marketing and sale of bulk commodities into the region.  Lloyds Banking Group slipped 0.65p to 91.35p despite a disposal - \u00a31.27bn worth of funds under management - and a buy note from Evolution Securities. Evo said:  Once the turnaround is over, Lloyds should emerge as the largest distributor of banking services in the UK, and the largest mortgage bank in Europe. Mortgages, well managed, can generate 25%-plus returns on equity. We estimate that Lloyds has a \u00a321bn capital deficit and expect a \u00a315bn rights issue very soon. We initiate with a buy, and a TERP (theoretical ex-rights price) based target price of 96p, offering 41% upside to investors buying today and taking up their rights.  Elsewhere BG was 8.5p better at \u00a311.55 after a buy note from Deutsche Bank with a \u00a312.75 price target. Car dealer Inchcape added 2.28p to 35.15p after it said full year profits would be higher than City expectations, helped by UK government scrappage scheme. Imagination Technologies continued its recent rise, up another 2.4p to 234.3p in the wake of forecast beating figures from Apple, which uses the company&apos;s chips in the iPhone and has a stake in the business.In a buy note Seymour Pierce said:  We believe that although the read across [from Apple] is unlikely to change analysts&apos; expectations [for Imagination] by much it is another piece of good news to drive the shares higher - much like the newsflow on netbooks. We hold the view that with so much of the UK tech market either stale or simply blue sky, Imagination offers investors a rare opportunity to invest in a technology growth story where the end market drivers are visible without having to dig too far.

In fact, you&apos;ve probably never heard of him at all. Yet for three and a half years during the second world war, this unassuming adventurer-naturalist lived behind Japanese lines in the jungles of Malaya, blowing up trains, bridges and enemy soldiers, training local insurgents, battling malaria and starvation. And all the while, remarkably, he was also taking detailed notes on the local birdlife and collecting seeds to send back to Kew Gardens. &quot;It&apos;s Ripping Yarns meets Charles Darwin,&quot; says Brian Moynahan, author of a new book about Chapman published this week. &quot;I find him such a very British person \u2013 what other nationality can you imagine holed up in the jungle with malaria and pneumonia, a regiment of Japanese soldiers on his trail, his only British comrade shot dead, yet still birdwatching? &quot;He had this line: &apos;I don&apos;t see why the Japanese should be allowed to inconvenience me.&apos; Extraordinary.&quot; In fact, Chapman&apos;s feats began long before the Malaya campaign. Born in 1907, he was effectively an orphan from the age of two, his mother having died of blood poisoning and his solicitor father \u2013 soon to be killed at Ypres in 1916 \u2013 giving him up to an elderly vicar in the Lake District. (In later life Chapman loathed churches, confessing not to be able to hear the sound of bells without his heart sinking.) But it was in the Lake District that Chapman gained his taste for the wild, earning pocket money by poaching rabbits on the fells. He was also eager to prove his toughness, demanding fellow prep-school pupils hit him on the head with a cricket bat &quot;to see how hard he could take it&quot;. At Cambridge University, Chapman night-climbed a lot of spires before coming down with a geography degree, whereupon he was attached as a ski expert and naturalist to the legendary Gino Watkins&apos;s 1930-31 British Arctic Air-Route Expedition and a subsequent Greenland Expedition in 1932\u201333. These trips, Moynahan says, allowed him to perfect his survival skills. He lost many finger- and toenails, survived more than 20 hours in a sealskin kayak during a monumental storm at sea, and learned to navigate by the stars, leading a small team across the lethal ice cap to rescue a stranded colleague. Chapman also demonstrated a complete absence of sentimentality. He ate the still-steaming kidneys of a recently-shot polar bear, and fed a litter of puppies born to one of the bitches in his sled team to the other dogs. He also learned to speak fluent Inuit, getting on well enough with the locals to father an illegitimate son with an Inuit woman. Before settling down to teach geography and run outdoor activities at Gordonstoun school in 1938, Chapman squeezed in a quick mountaineering expedition to the Himalayas, where he was persuaded to join a mission to find the Dalai Lama. That never happened but, on the way back in May 1937, Chapman and Sherpa Pasang Dawa Lama became the first men to reach the summit of the 7,134m of Mount Chomolhari, the so-called Bride of Kanchenjunga \u2013 so fearsome that it was not climbed again until 1970. He also pressed 600 plants, dried countless seeds and made copious notes on bird life. And then, of course, came the war. &quot;The war brought out in Chapman every resource and quality he had developed in his life,&quot; says Moynahan. After serving as a fieldcraft trainer in Scotland with David Stirling, the future founder of the SAS, Chapman was deployed to Singapore in 1941 and charged with preparing &quot;left-behind&apos;&apos; parties of soldiers who could mount insurgent attacks in the event of Singapore falling to the Japanese. When Singapore did fall, in early 1942, Chapman disappeared into the mountains, not to emerge again until May 1945. Conditions were atrocious. Half-starved, delirious due to malaria and festering ulcers from leech bites, Chapman and the two Brits he had eventually linked up with daubed themselves in dye, marched miles through the dense jungle by night, and set about inconveniencing the Japanese. In the first fortnight alone, they blew up 15 railway bridges, derailed seven trains and exploded 40 military vehicles, mostly using homemade bombs of gelignite hidden in bamboo sticks. They used 1,000lb of explosives, threw 100 grenades, and caused \u2013 according to Chapman&apos;s own estimate \u2013 between 500 and 1,500 enemy casualties. The Japanese command believed it was up against 200 highly trained commandos, and deployed 2,000 troops to hunt the three-man band down. Aware that this rate of attack could never be kept up, Chapman tried to make it to the sea but was eventually forced back into the jungle where he started training local insurgents \u2013 teaching them to whistle The Lambeth Walk for identification purposes after dark while announcing his own nocturnal arrival with the cry of a British tawny owl. Almost permanently sick, Chapman spent 17 days in a coma, only subsequently realising what had happened from the absence of any notes in his diary. Once, he was so feverish that his mouth had to be bound shut to prevent his chattering teeth giving away his whereabouts to a Japanese patrol. And on the one occasion he was arrested, Chapman blithely announced that a Japanese prince had been his keen birdwatching companion at Cambridge. The arresting officer was apparently so charmed that he apologised for having no whisky to offer Chapman, and declined to bind his hands and feet. Chapman then waited till dead of night and, despite a debilitating bout of malaria, made good his escape. &quot;What kept him going,&quot; says Moynahan, &quot;was his overriding love of nature and wildlife. He had to have a reason for his adventuring, and it was botany. That&apos;s what kept his mind alive \u2013 you only have to look at his diaries.&quot; For Chapman, it was all in the mind. &quot;His great belief \u2013 and the title of his book on his Malayan adventures \u2013 was &apos;the jungle is neutral&apos;. His philosophy was simple: &apos;There is neither good nor bad, but thinking makes it so.&apos;&quot; Writing of Chapman after the war, Field Marshal Earl Wavell said that, &quot;for sheer courage and endurance, physical and mental&quot;, the adventurer-naturalist stood together with TE Lawrence as &quot;examples of what toughness the body will find, if the spirit within it is tough&quot;. Both, Wavell reckoned, were &quot;very worthy representatives of our national capacity for individual enterprise&quot;. Quite why Chapman hasn&apos;t found Lawrence of Arabia&apos;s fame is anyone&apos;s guess. After the war, he was headmaster of schools in Germany and South Africa. Married with three children, he ended up as warden of a hall of residence at Reading University. Forced to retire before he would have wished, aware his health and energy were no longer what they were, and suffering from one of the periodic bouts of depression that had gripped him since Cambridge, he shot himself in the head in his office, aged 64. &quot;He was a man of extraordinary depth, intensely loyal, intensely principled,&quot; says Moynahan. &quot;He quit South Africa when apartheid started to bite, resigning his job with a wife and three children. Likeable probably wasn&apos;t the word; he could be quite brutal to people he felt were victims of their own failings, like some of the British soldiers overrun in Malaya. But he&apos;s the kind of man of whom you can unashamedly say, you&apos;re very proud he was British.&quot; Jungle Soldier by Brian Moynahan is published by Quercus, priced \u00a318.99"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/21/real-world-boom-virtual-cities", "sentences": ["One is run by the German-owned Twinity, which already has a virtual Berlin (where I have an apartment) and a Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-21T12:30:01Z", "title": "The real-world boom in\u00a0online cities", "tags": ["Virtual worlds", "Second Life", "3D", "Internet", "Technology", "MMORPG"], "article": "The internet has been evolving into three dimensions for years without most people noticing.

From Tokyo to Helsinki and from Paris to Philadelphia, cities are being constructed at a pace that recalls 19th-century railway mania; except, mercifully, it is a lot cheaper and won&apos;t have serious economic effects if there is a crash. People who haven&apos;t tried them can&apos;t take virtual worlds seriously but in key ways they are more &quot;real&quot; and communal than real life: it is much easier to speak to people in shops or galleries, since normal social inhibitions are absent. There has been a virtual central London in Second Life for three years offering clubs, shops, galleries and other distractions. This year it featured a Chelsea Flower Show and an arts and film festival including a spoof James Bond film. It is moving into education, corporate building and high-end fashion linked to sales in real life. Debs Regent (her Second Life name), who runs it, claims that it is gaining 2,000 users a week and is breaking even. \u00a0It now faces fresh competition from two new virtual Londons with contrasting business plans due to open in the next month or two. One is run by the German-owned Twinity, which already has a virtual Berlin (where I have an apartment) and a Singapore. It will focus initially on the community and enthusiasts \u2013 invited via a Facebook group \u2013 while also exploring commercial opportunities such as leasing Oxford Street shops to their real-life owners. The other new London, run by Alex Wrottesley, co-founder of Near, has an initial plan to harness what drives most people to the West End: shopping. His London is a faithful laser-mapped reproduction of buildings with blobs of light instead of avatars. The idea is that people will roam streets and if they like something in a window they can click and be taken to that company&apos;s website with Near taking a share of any sales. He claims to have signed up dozens of brands, including American Apparel, and says that as a result of subscriptions from corporate subscribers it will be making a monthly profit next month. Promotions include 50,000 DVDs being circulated via the Evening Standard. It is also using Facebook for recruitment and is in effect a Facebook application. The message is: why take a crowded tube to an overcrowded city centre when you can do it from home? These three are not the only virtual Londons. University College has built a 3D grid stretching as far as the M25, while the likes of Google and Microsoft are recreating cities all over the world, enabling others to do mash-ups by superimposing their own data on them. Google recently released its Building Maker, a simple way to capture a building shape in Google Earth for placement elsewhere. So far it has Cardiff but not London. Other versions of cities are being built for private clients. All the London builders welcome competition, if only because it gets more people used to the idea. All realise that the barriers between virtual worlds and social networks such as Facebook are falling fast. Some functions of virtual worlds such as chat could be done on a mobile, while people on networks might want to slip into virtual Oxford Street to shop. I am as sure of virtual worlds becoming a mass phenomenon as I am unsure which formats will prove successful. Twinity scores high on use of live media (websites, weather updates etc) but is not yet easy to access (though like Near it has yet to go public). Near is the most focused and Debs Regent&apos;s the most communal and longest established. It may be that there is room for lots of them.

One great big cardboard box contains the usual slimline DVD holder and a couple of bits of paper, one of which is a moderately useful getting-started guide. That&apos;s one of the improvements on the previous version, when we grumbled about the lack of useful documentation in the box. Another improvement is a slightly faster install time: 15 minutes instead of 20. It&apos;s still a sucky routine, though \u2013 double-click the DVD icon, find the installer app, double-click that. Come on, Adobe, it&apos;s time you joined the rest of the world and your Mac apps could be dragged into the Applications folder. Anyway, the good news is that it works with Snow Leopard \u2013 I had a momentary &quot;oh hell, what if it doesn&apos;t&quot; wibble. It does. So what else is new? Elements 8 has acquired some of the tricks that full-fat Photoshop did in CS4, including intelligent resizing, which means you can stretch/squash an image without distorting it. And there&apos;s cosmetic surgery \u2013 you can whiten teeth with, yes, the toothbrush tool. More usefully, it&apos;s now reasonably easy to remove unwanted elements from photographs. If you&apos;ve since ditched a boyfriend who appears in all the pictures from last Christmas, he can be airbrushed from history in just six steps. And you can create composite images: so if Aunt Edna looked more than a little squiffy on one too many champagne cocktails in some of those Christmas shots, you can save her blushes by transposing a shot taken before her third Singapore sling. As on previous versions, the image management application Bridge is included, and it too has gained a few tricks. You can flip through images in full-screen mode, rating them as you go. You can also create PDFs and web galleries in Bridge \u2013 there are several templates available, including a Flash gallery. It runs pretty fast on my 18-month-old MacBook Air, which, with its 1.6GHz Core 2 Duo processor and 2GB of RAM is not the speediest and newest machine on the planet, opening and handling images across my wireless network impressively well. So that&apos;s a good thing. And there is an awful lot happening under the hood \u2013 you could spend weeks tinkering and playing with everything Adobe stuffs into this package. But is it just too much bang for your buck? Will you ever really get to grips with everything? The price is hefty \u2013 the full version if you buy it direct from Adobe&apos;s website is \u00a374.75; and all the tabs, options and sliders are daunting even for an experienced user. If you&apos;ve got version 6, don&apos;t rush to upgrade. If you&apos;ve got a family member with a shiny new Mac, good photographic knowledge and bags of enthusiasm (plus you&apos;ve got deep pockets), Elements 8 is a fantastic gift. Pros: Lots of clever new tricks gained from the CS4 version of Photoshop, runs well on older Macs and works with Snow Leopard Cons: Expensive, daunting interface http://bit.ly/elements8mac  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/21/subcontinent-man-asian-literary-prize", "sentences": ["Authors from Bhutan, Mongolia and Myanmar as well as from Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan also submitted work for the prize, which will announce its winner on 16 November in Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-21T14:33:56Z", "title": "Indian subcontinent dominates Man Asian literary prize shortlist", "tags": ["Man Asian literary prize", "Fiction", "Awards and prizes", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "The final for this year&apos;s Man Asian literary prize is dominated by writers from the Indian subcontinent. Of the five shortlisted authors, two are Indian and one is Kashmiri-born, with the field completed by one Chinese and one Filipino author contending for the prize, which was conceived &quot;to bring exciting new Asian authors to the attention of the world literary community&quot;. It is now into its third year and carries a $10,000 (\u00a36,000) purse. Nitasha Kaul is an academic, poet and author who has been shortlisted for her debut novel Residue. She heard about the shortlisting late at night in Thimphu, Bhutan, where she has been speaking at a conference on democracy.  &quot;I got the news on the web, and I simultaneously had a smile and a tear. I shared how I felt in a first glance exchanged with the dark mountains and the starry skies,&quot; she said today. &quot;[I am] delighted, excited, validated. It&apos;s a great pleasure to see one&apos;s novel transition from being a labour of love to something that conveys meaning to other people.&quot; Like the protagonists of Residue, Kaul is from Kashmir but grew up in Delhi. The book &quot;is about exile in terms of identity and mobility - who we are and how that helps or hinders us in our ability to move - moving across borders in terms of passport, as well as moving on from events in terms of belonging,&quot; she said. It tells the story of the evolving relationship between Keya Raina and Leon Ali, who are both from Kashmir but have never lived there. Also shortlisted are journalist, author and political adviser Omair Ahmad&apos;s Jimmy the Terrorist, about politics in an Indian Muslim community, and Indian author and publisher Siddharth Chowdhury&apos;s Day Scholar, part of which was written while he was on a writer-in-residence fellowship at the University of Stirling in Scotland. His novel is about Zorawar Singh Shokeen of Chandrawal, a powerful Delhi property broker and political dealer, who brings his mistresses to the hostel he runs. Bestselling Chinese novelist Su Tong&apos;s unsettling Cultural Revolution-set novel The Boat to Redemption also makes the list. Telling the story of a former playboy who is banished to live on a river barge after his wife reports his bad behaviour to the authorities, The Boat to Redemption explores a dangerous obsession which develops after a young orphan girl comes to live on the boat. The playboy, ashamed of his previous lifestyle, has already castrated himself. The list is completed with The Descartes Highlands by Manila-born Eric Gamalinda, a novelist and poet who now teaches at Columbia University in the US. The book tells the story of a woman who buys a baby in Manila. Irish novelist Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, who is chairing the judging panel, praised the wide scope of the shortlist. &quot;The variety of ways in which voice and tone was used in these novels, the sense of commitment to story, the range in the methods of exploring both self and society, the interest in experimenting and making it new, made the time spent judging this prize rewarding and enlightening,&quot; he said. The three-year-old prize, previously won by Chinese author Jiang Rong&apos;s Wolf Totem and Filipino writer Miguel Syjuco&apos;s Ilustrado, has met controversy in the past over its definition of Asian. This includes 25 countries, from Mongolia to North Korea and Afghanistan, but fails to encompass the likes of Turkey, Iran or any of the &apos;Stans. This year T\u00f3ib\u00edn and his fellow judges, the Chinese-American author Gish Jen and the Indian writer Pankaj Mishra, received 150 submissions, with the most coming from India, followed by the Philippines and Hong Kong. Authors from Bhutan, Mongolia and Myanmar as well as from Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan also submitted work for the prize, which will announce its winner on 16 November in Hong Kong.

Coe&apos;s vision for an Olympics that could help inspire a generation of young people helped win the 2012 Games \u2013 of which he is chairman \u2013 for London and the government subsequently promised to get two million more people doing sport or taking part in more physical activity by 2013. The most recent figures from Sport England, which is investing \u00a3480m in grassroots sport over the next four years, show that only three sports had recorded an increase in participation in the past year. The government has argued the investment needs time to take effect but others claim the participation plans are ill-focused and failing to deliver. Earlier this month, Sir Steve Redgrave was appointed as a sports legacy &quot;champion&quot; by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in order to act as a figurehead for the drive. &quot;The legacy from sports participation is a better story than is currently being told,&quot; Coe told the London Assembly. &quot;My concern for some time is that we are not collating that narrative as well as we could be. My experience of travelling widely throughout schools in London and the UK is that national governing bodies, local education authorities and agencies have risen to this challenge. I hope we are properly gathering the information that will enable us to tell the story in a coherent way come 2012.&quot; But Coe also made clear that it was not the organising committee&apos;s job to drive increased sports participation, despite the fact he is personally closely associated with the promises he made in Singapore in 2005. &quot;It is deep in my DNA to want to see more people play sport at the end of this process and, if you&apos;re pressing me, that&apos;s why I went to Singapore. But I also went to Singapore to make a presentation on behalf of three other stakeholders. This was not a bidding committee message alone - I delivered it on behalf of this organisation [the Assembly], the government and the British Olympic Association. It is very important that the coherent strategy is understood among those responsible for delivering it,&quot; he said. &quot;The issue for me is using our branding and using our programmes to drive some of these legacies, but also making sure the organisations directly responsible are doing that. I am satisfied that is now taking place.&quot; At a later meeting of the Assembly&apos;s economic development, culture, sport and tourism committee, the chair of the new Olympic Park Legacy Company promised to deliver a report on the future of the main stadium by December. Fierce debate has surrounded the fate of the stadium after the Games and whether or not it should be reduced from 80,000 to 28,000 capacity as originally planned, or maintained for possible use as a venue at the 2015 Rugby World Cup or in England&apos;s bid for the 2018 World Cup. &quot;People talk about the problems with having a running track. But I&apos;m old enough to remember when there was a dog track going around Stamford Bridge and four of the last five World Cups have been in stadia where there was a running track,&quot; said the legacy company chair, Margaret Ford. &quot;We don&apos;t think keeping that promise and keeping rugby or football alongside are mutually exclusive.&quot; She also called for the new company to have a say in the fate of the housing in the Olympic Village that will be pre-sold by the Olympic Delivery Authority in the run up to the Games."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/22/jean-todt-fia-ari-vatanen", "sentences": ["I met the teams in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-21T23:10:03Z", "title": "Action man Jean Todt steps out of Max Mosley's shadow", "tags": ["Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "&quot;I am an action man,&quot; Jean Todt says as he leans forward in his hushed apartment in Paris. Halfway down a pretty side street, not far from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Todt&apos;s home currently doubles as his campaign headquarters in a furious battle for control over the future of motorsport. Tomorrow, a secret vote will decide whether the 63-year-old Frenchman or Ari Vatanen, his increasingly bitter election rival, will become president of the FIA (the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l&apos;Automobile). Blood has not, as yet, been spilled in either the feverishly chic Todt enclave or on the marbled floors of the FIA offices in Paris or Monaco, but war has clearly been declared. Todt, a small action man of massive ambition, is being backed by Max Mosley, the outgoing president who has finally been forced to relinquish the role after 16 years of acrimony and controversy. Mosley, with as much bite as bark, has been the campaigning attack dog \u2013 allowing Todt to adopt a low-key persona against an opponent, Vatanen, with whom he shares a complicated past. &quot;I&apos;ve never done anything like this before,&quot; Todt says, &quot;and that is why this election is quite difficult. I have always faced competition but having a competitor like this is different. I don&apos;t have any problems with people choosing \u2013 but sometimes people judge you without meeting you. They don&apos;t even give you a chance to meet, and that is frustrating. I&apos;ve had to face some situations which are not relevant, or proper.&quot; Todt is quietly seething. Vatanen, having ridiculed Mosley&apos;s lack of neutrality and questioned the legality of the FIA election, is campaigning as a candidate of change. Yet, according to Todt&apos;s camp, Vatanen apparently asked Mosley for his support at a private lunch in early July. After Mosley refused, the Finn urged him, unsuccessfully, to remain neutral. Vatanen has since argued that he was &quot;joking&quot; \u2013 a suggestion which Mosley belittles. &quot;I know my competitor went to see Bernie [Ecclestone] as well,&quot; Todt remarks. &quot;He wanted to try and convince Bernie to support him. Bernie said no. There are a lot of others he tried to convince.&quot; The allegation undermines Vatanen&apos;s claim to personify a new era \u2013 and Todt rolls his eyes when remembering that Vatanen has even evoked Barack Obama in pressing his credentials. &quot;I would say that is presumptuous,&quot; Todt snorts. &quot;You know, for me, Obama is a genius in communication. He is a Nobel peace prize-winning president of the United States. I would never dare compare myself to the most powerful man in the world.&quot; In his defence, Vatanen did not really compare himself to Obama but underlined a shared hope to transform a diseased system. &quot;You must compare our policies,&quot; Todt shrugs. &quot;I feel we propose much more change. But I don&apos;t want to be judged on promises. I want to be judged on delivery. I know his slogan is &apos;The Tide Is Changing&apos; \u2013 but you can&apos;t change without proper arguments. &quot;I only bother about wrong allegations. I use the example of Michelle [Yeoh, his partner, the Malaysian actress renowned for her action-heroine roles in movies such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]. For a long time she has been doing a lot for road safety charities for no financial gain. It is completely inappropriate for this to be used against her. It is awful.&quot; Yet Mosley has been vehement on behalf of Todt. He wrote to Prince Faisal al\u2011Hussein, the chairman of Jordanian motorsport who had the temerity to endorse Vatanen, and warned that the Finn &quot;will lose the election, and lose badly&quot;. Mosley also hinted darkly that a supposedly anonymous ballot would not prevent those who voted against Todt being ostracised. &quot;Any thoughts that after this election everyone in motorsport can unite and work together can be forgotten,&quot; Mosley thundered \u2013 in a letter leaked with damaging impact to the Todt campaign. So Mosley&apos;s support may have become a millstone rather than an advantage in this fractious election. If Todt&apos;s victory was once assured, some generous estimates now speculate that Vatanen could claim 98 of the 104 votes he needs. Todt bristles at the suggestion. &quot;I felt disappointed when the other side announced they had 80% of the votes in the Middle East. That is untrue. It&apos;s not good. If you are talking about transparency, and saying things must be clean, how can you give wrong information?&quot; What might be an accurate assessment of the crucial Middle Eastern vote? &quot;I will not give you a figure but a large majority is in our favour. I have never met Prince Faisal. But I hope I will meet him soon and show I can deliver a good job. If I am elected I want everyone to participate. One of my challenges will be to work well with Jordan and others who did not support me. I want to start from a blank sheet.&quot; Todt, by now, sounds positively animated as he proposes himself as the &quot;candidate of harmony&quot;. It is enough to make even a casual visitor to the strife-filled world of Formula One break out into a cackle of disbelief. How can Todt, a demanding man second only to Mosley when it comes to raising the hackles of most F1 insiders, bring harmony to this perpetual battleground? &quot;That&apos;s what I like to do,&quot; he exclaims, &quot;to put harmony in a place where it has been missing.&quot; He stresses that, rather than ruling F1 himself, he will appoint a commissioner to run the sport. As this is rumoured to be Alan Donnelly, regarded as another &quot;Mosley man&quot;, it does not resemble an instant recipe for harmony. But it would be ludicrous to believe the formidable Todt is merely Mosley&apos;s front man. Todt is a serious operator and an undeniably brilliant manager, who will not be dictated to by anyone. But surely his icy toughness will continue to alienate many people? &quot;I have been a tough competitor in the past,&quot; he concedes. &quot;Maybe they think I will be tough again in the FIA. But it will be a new position and I will handle the situation differently. I met the teams in Singapore. I can&apos;t betray what was said but, believe me, they are not against me. If I am elected I can start a new chapter, and the FIA will be my new team.&quot; At Ferrari he transformed a malfunctioning old warhorse, beset by discord, into a sleekly united winning machine. &quot;When I first arrived [in 1993] some said my job was impossible. Alain Prost said: &apos;You&apos;ve been very successful so far but, with Ferrari, forget it&apos;. That made me more determined. The big difficulty was being this French guy coming to an Italian team and being told: &apos;In this position, you don&apos;t normally last more than a year&apos;. I often thought they would fire me. And that was my proudest achievement \u2013 to have resisted and then delivered. I think this job at the FIA would be easier than what I did at Ferrari. It&apos;s one of my easiest tasks to bring harmony.&quot; The man standing in his way cuts a more obscure figure. And yet, in another strange twist, Todt knows Vatanen, six years his junior, better than most people in motorsport. Having worked as his rally team director at Peugeot, Todt endured some fraught experiences with Vatanen. &quot;I&apos;ve known him many years. First, in 1981, we competed against each other as drivers. Then, when I was put in charge of Peugeot, I took him as a driver. He was very talented \u2013 but sometimes a bit wild. He had a very bad crash in Argentina [in 1985] and it almost killed him. It was difficult. He was very depressed and I remember visiting him often, supporting him, because he could not drive for 18 months. But we helped him return to racing.&quot; One of their most infamous collaborations, Todt suggests, was sparked by his fear that Vatanen and his fellow driver at Peugeot, Jacky Ickx, would kill themselves during the 1989 Paris-Dakar Rally. Vatanen and Ickx, dicing for the lead at the end of the 11th stage, had left their rivals trailing far behind. &quot;They both told me: &apos;We are driving at crazy speeds. You must do something&apos;.&quot; Todt recalls. &quot;My main concern was not to have anyone killed because one of my worst moments had already happened. I had seen Jacky&apos;s car roll and catch fire in front of me. Jacky managed to escape but his co-driver, Christian Tarin, died. I could not allow it to happen again. I decided the best choice was to spin a coin, which they accepted. It came down in favour of Ari, and so my team orders were he would win the race. &quot;The victim was Jacky Ickx and, incidentally, he is a big supporter of me in this competition. But I&apos;ve always been close to Ari. Last year at Monte Carlo he asked me to give him official support at the European elections. I was the only one to do that. I spoke for him but he was beaten in those elections. Today he is doing his FIA campaign and I am doing mine. He is an opponent now.&quot; Their tangled relationship mirrors Todt&apos;s complex character. He is driven and accomplished, and yet his fingertips are covered in bandages \u2013 for he bites his nails down to the bloodied quick. &quot;No, this time they are just itchy,&quot; he protests. &quot;But I am anxious. It is in my nature. I like to do well. I am committed. I have the passion.&quot; Drawing a little wooden box out of his pocket, he says: &quot;I will show you something. I am a bit superstitious and so I like to touch wood. I did this a lot before every race and, still, when I need strength I touch wood.&quot; On Friday, in the final hours before his battle with Vatanen is decided, will Todt reach for his wooden box with more anxiety than usual? &quot;No,&quot; he says with sudden finality. &quot;I will be calm. I am quite optimistic the result will be in my favour.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/23/un-north-korea-hungry", "sentences": ["Publication of the report comes amid reports of a secret meeting between North and South Korean officials last week in Singapore to discuss a possible summit of Kim Jong-il, the North&apos;s leader, and Lee Myung-bak, the South&apos;s president."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-23T08:34:02Z", "title": "UN envoy says North Korea should feed its 9 million hungry citizens", "tags": ["North Korea", "United Nations", "Human rights", "World news", "Law"], "article": "North Korea should take urgent steps to improve its &quot;abysmal&quot; human rights record by providing food to its hungry citizens, a UN envoy said yesterday as he released a scathing report on the reclusive country. The report noted that almost 9 million people in North Korea were suffering from food shortages, with the World Food Programme (WFP) able to reach fewer than 2 million of the hungry population due to a shortfall in international aid as countries cut funding in response to Pyongyang&apos;s nuclear and missile tests. The UN imposed new sanctions on North Korea after it tested a second nuclear device in May, following a first test in 2006. &quot;I estimate at least a third of the population are in the hunger situation out of the projected 24 million population, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, the UN rapporteur for North Korea. Muntarbhorn, a Thai professor who has investigated North Korea for nearly six years but never been allowed entry, was presenting his latest report to the UN general assembly committee that deals with human rights issues. North Korea&apos;s deputy UN ambassador, Pak Tok Hun, rejected the report, calling it a &quot;politically conspired document, full of distortion, lies, falsity, devised by hostile forces&quot;. Muntarbhorn dropped any diplomatic niceties as he rounded on the regime&apos;s treatment of its own people. &quot;The freedoms from want, from fear, from discrimination, from persecution and from exploitation are regrettably transgressed with impunity by those authorities, in an astonishing setting of abuse after abuse,&quot; Muntarbhorn said in his report. &quot;They compromise and threaten not only human rights, but also international peace and security.&quot; He pointed out that while poverty was rife in North Korea, the country itself was endowed with vast mineral resources. &quot;It is the exploitation of the ordinary people which has become the pernicious prerogative of the ruling elite. This is all the more ironic since it is reported that the economy has improved slightly over the past year, an indication that more resources could be available to help the population,&quot; he said. Publication of the report comes amid reports of a secret meeting between North and South Korean officials last week in Singapore to discuss a possible summit of Kim Jong-il, the North&apos;s leader, and Lee Myung-bak, the South&apos;s president. Relations between the two Koreas deteriorated after Lee adopted a tougher line towards the North after taking office early last year. He linked aid for Pyongyang to progress on efforts to end its nuclear programme. In response, Pyongyang suspended reconciliation talks and most of their joint projects. In recent months, the North has taken a more conciliatory tone, freeing detained South Koreans and pledged to resume joint projects, possibly in response to the effects of the UN sanctions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/oct/23/martin-kaymer-leads-castello-masters", "sentences": ["I&apos;ll have an MRI scan in Bristol when I get back and hopefully I can still go to Singapore next week.&quot;"], "publicationDate": "2009-10-23T22:33:31Z", "title": "Martin Kaymer takes share of lead at Castell\u00f3 Masters", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Martin Kaymer"], "article": "Martin Kaymer surprised himself by taking a share of the lead after the second round of the Castell\u00f3 Masters today.

Bonuses, in the scheme of things, are minute,&quot; prince Andrew told the Daily Telegraph. &quot;They are easy to target. A number will have abused their privilege of a bonus, so get rid of the excesses, but don&apos;t throw the baby out with the bath water.&quot; Despite praising the government for taking &quot;brave steps&quot; in tackling the recession, the prince took the opportunity to express concern over the impact of the government&apos;s plans to close tax loopholes on millionaire non-domiciled residents. &quot;I am concerned from the point of view that we want to encourage people into this country and to work. Are we trying to prevent people coming in? For what gain?... will it have a detrimental effect for the UK in the long run?&quot; he said.

He has been accused of clocking up thousands of pounds on first-class travel and appearances at prestigious sporting events. Last year his bill came to \u00a3140,000.

According to royal accounts in 2003, the prince attended two England football matches at a cost over \u00a330,000 to promote trade links. Two years later he was criticised by the National Audit Office for spending \u00a33,000 on a 50-mile trip by royal helicopter to lunch with Arab dignitaries. More recently he was the subject of a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation into his role as a trade ambassador and potential conflicts of interest.

Which is why last Tuesday evening&apos;s speech from Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, was so remarkable. Love him or loathe him \u2013 and it is hard to find anyone who loves him \u2013 he did give vent to some honest-to-God anger. It was good to hear. He finally lost his rag and in an extraordinary speech struck the tone that the political class steadfastly avoids. The moral hazard of bankers making vast fortunes underwritten by ordinary taxpayers was perhaps the greatest of all time, he declared. Never has so much been owed by so few to so many, he opined, for so little reform. He was scornful of trying to force bankers to use more capital to restrain their addiction to risky innovation and bonuses, a policy championed by Lord Turner, the chair of the Financial Services Authority, and the chancellor. It was certainly &quot;worth a try&quot;, but the plain truth was that fleet of foot, endlessly inventive financiers would run rings around the PC Plods of financial regulation whether in London or Basel, where the international rules are agreed. Then he launched an Exocet. If the status quo is untenable and unfair because it leaves us with banks so big they have to be bailed out in a crisis, and if the proposed increases in bank capital advanced by the government are unlikely to act as a restraint, then there is only one course of action left: we have to break up the megabanks. The speculative, risky parts of banks must be separated from the commercial parts which lend to business, consumers and home buyers. This, after all, is what the Americans did after the 1929-33 crash. Under the famous Glass-Steagall Act, commercial banks were forbidden to offer any form of collateral, underwriting or loan that financed stocks and shares. The same could be done today. The banking the economy needs \u2013 so-called narrow banking \u2013 could be closely regulated and casino banking could be left to its separate, freewheeling devices. The governor has had much bile poured over his head. King is accused of intellectual showing-off without any solid work to support his position and trying to embarrass the chair of the FSA who he knew was going to propose the opposite only a few days later. Which is exactly what Lord Turner did. Glass-Steagall is impossible in the current markets, he declared on Thursday, presenting the FSA&apos;s discussion paper. Universal banks that combine investment and commercial banking provide an important service to their business customers and are the rule in the US and Europe. You could not and should not stop them. In any case, drawing the line between the casino and the rest in today&apos;s sophisticated financial world is impossible. The way forward, he repeated, is more capital, especially more capital for the casino parts of any bank&apos;s business. On top, banks should make &quot;living wills&quot;, setting out how they would wind themselves up without any cost to the taxpayer. Together, that would hit them where it hurts. So here are the two sharpest brains working in the official sector of British finance eyeball to eyeball. If the issue was some arcane aspect of accounting, it would hardly matter. But reforming big finance ranks alongside climate change and the Middle East conflict as one of the great policy challenges of our time. If the system continues unreformed, with megabanks reinventing the now dysfunctional casino, the next crash really will overwhelm us and the political fall-out could easily lead to protection and depression, alongside ugly nationalist ideologies. As it is, the depth of recession and elusiveness of recovery are storm warnings. So who is right \u2013 King or Turner? Both make good points. King is surely right that the issue of banks that are too big to fail must be confronted. Relying on lowest common denominator international agreements on more capital and &quot;living wills&quot; can only go so far. So-called Basel 2, agreed in 2004, took years of horse trading and ended up embracing the approach to risk that brought the system down, in effect giving the big banks the green light to assess their own risks and capital needs. This was the regime that allowed Northern Rock to pay a dividend the year it went bust and Lehman Brothers to borrow 50 times more than its capital. It hardly inspires confidence. But Turner lands a counter-punch on the governor over doing a British Glass-Steagall. The US version unravelled over 20 years. In the Mervyn King-does-not-know-what-he-is-talking-about slide in his presentation, Turner asks rhetorically how Mr King thinks the separation between casino and commercial banking should be made. For example, customers legitimately want to hedge their positions in foreign currency and interest rates. Should they be forbidden to do it with their bank? We should heed both men. Britain should now break up its banks that are too big to fail as the US once trust-busted Standard Oil in 1911 when it got far too large \u2013 the King solution. The impact on British finance and the powerful financial oligarchs would be irreversible and unforgettable. We could create more than a dozen banks where we now have four \u2013 NatWest, Bank of Scotland, and the Halifax should be given their independence again \u2013 and new banks created to specialise in infrastructure and innovation financing, where there is a gaping hole. There could be a genuinely competitive banking market, fighting to increase lending in all parts of the country and driving a sustained recovery. No single bank could pose a systemic risk because none would be large enough. It would be a market, however, regulated and structured on Turner&apos;s principles. The more risky the banks&apos; activities, the more capital they should be required to carry. Bankers&apos; bonuses would be restrained by requiring remuneration to be linked to a far wider range of indicators that just the share price or the profit on a particular trading desk. Suddenly, we would have a banking system that serves business and customers alike and whose pay would come back to Earth. The chairs of the megabanks will doubtless protest that the City&apos;s competitiveness will be irretrievably damaged \u2013 and London&apos;s mayor, Boris Johnson, will almost certainly harrumph with some typically rich Latin tags. There will be threats to leave, but to where? Singapore and Dubai do not have the GDP to underwrite trillion-pound megabanks and thus support markets deep enough to underpin their activities. British guarantees operate only in Britain. In any case, the aim of policy after the biggest financial crisis for 60 years should not be to promote the City&apos;s interest and financiers&apos; bonuses underwritten by the taxpayer. It should be to create a financial system that helps the economy grow and can stand on its own two feet. Breaking up big finance in a British Standard Oil moment would trigger sustained recovery. It would be hard not to vote for the party that had the steel to do it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/25/tamara-rojo-arts-funding", "sentences": ["It has been adopted by many other countries, including most of Scandinavia, Singapore and Korea."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-24T23:06:35Z", "title": "Britain offers great art a true sanctuary | Tamara Rojo", "tags": ["Arts funding", "Stage", "Ballet", "Dance", "Royal Ballet", "Culture", "Tamara Rojo"], "article": "On Thursday, I will run on to the stage at Covent Garden to dance the part of Mary Vetsera in Mayerling, one of the great roles in the Royal Ballet&apos;s repertoire. It&apos;s a privilege I could never hope for in Spain, despite being born and raised in Madrid. There is always controversy about the way the world&apos;s great arts companies are supported in the nations that host them. The Arts Council is forever subject to criticism, but I&apos;ve seen what happens in countries where major companies have to fend for themselves or cuddle up to politicians. I am often asked why there is no major classical ballet company in Spain. It&apos;s a simple enough question and a logical one considering that most western nations have at least one. Many ballet companies around the world have excellent Spaniards in their ranks, dancers who have been nurtured and trained in Spain, but who are then orphaned by their mother country and forced to emigrate to pursue their careers. But the answer is highly complicated. The most common argument used to explain this anomaly of Spanish culture is that Spain does not have a tradition of classical ballet. Yet it is a fallacy. Spain had a corps de ballet from the 19th century through to the first decades of the 20th century. The causes are political rather than cultural or historical. As a principal of the Royal Ballet, I am privileged to be invited to dance all over the world. As well as more than 30 shows at the Royal Opera House last year, I performed in Russia, China, Japan, Cuba, Italy, Spain and the US. This has offered a unique insight into the different ways the arts are nurtured across the world. A common assumption is that artists will survive no matter how bad the situation a country finds itself in and that the arts have their own momentum. It&apos;s a cliche often reinforced with examples of great art being produced in difficult times by, say, Picasso or Lorca. In reality though, there are noticeable differences in the health of the arts from one country to the next. In the US and, with slight differences, also in Japan, the performing arts have minimal state funding. Instead, there are wealthy patrons, whether corporations or individuals, encouraged by tax breaks. While this has the advantage of unburdening the state, it comes with the temptation to allow influence to those giving the money. At best, it will mean the renaming of buildings or allowing patrons to decide the colour of the new front-of-house carpet, but, at worst, it can change artistic policy and impact on repertoire. The current economic climate has thrown up other disadvantages. In the last year, many companies in North America have been making redundancies in order to survive. The most extreme consequence of this can be seen in Japan, where most dancers do not receive a salary but are paid show by show and so need other jobs to survive. On one of my first visits as a guest in Tokyo, at the gala dinner after the opening night, I suddenly realised that the people waiting on table were the very same dancers with whom I had shared the stage a few moments before. I am usually extremely hungry after the show, but that night I lost my appetite. The French model, also practised with some differences in Italy and Spain, is based on government intervention through the Ministry of Culture. The majority of symphony orchestras, opera, theatres and ballet companies are publicly owned. The government soaks up the costs, running the arts as a state department like healthcare or education. The Council of Europe called this &quot;cultural monarchy&quot;, commenting: &quot;Ministers, whoever they might be, define their options and take their decisions in sovereign fashion, in a way according to the principles of enlightened despotism.&quot; This is also true of Spain. And when a government runs the arts, it creates a dependency of the artist on politicians and bureaucrats. If the political situation is volatile, the consequences can be terrible. For example, in the last five years, I have been invited to perform with the Scala Ballet of Milan by three different artistic directors. Although it is always a pleasure to perform with them, I can understand the insecurity and artistic frustration many of the dancers feel. Political patronage can cause difficulties in the opposite direction. Spain&apos;s contemporary dance company, Compa\u00f1ia Nacional de Danza, has had the same director for almost 20 years, a perfect example of &quot;cultural monarchy&quot;. The British should be proud of their belief in the arm&apos;s-length principle. Between the government and the artists is an arts council. It has been adopted by many other countries, including most of Scandinavia, Singapore and Korea. The principle was instituted to prevent the intervention of political power in culture after the Nazi ordeal. Big artistic companies, like ballet companies, require support from the state. On the other hand, artists need to be free to be creative. This requires objectivity and transparency in decision-making, the intrinsic values of the current British model. Until a similar system is installed in my country, any personal initiative to found a classical ballet company, however well-intended, will be forever subject to the whims of the incumbent governments and therefore, as much as it saddens me to admit it, destined for failure.

There may be outstanding business \u2013 the fight between Sebastian Vettel and Rubens Barrichello for second place in the drivers&apos; standings and the contest for third in the constructors&apos; championship between Ferrari and McLaren \u2013 but next weekend will be about reflections and farewells at the end of yet another remarkable season. Leaving the politics and scandals aside for the moment, there will be many dinner-table debates about the merits of the 25 drivers who have taken part in the 16 races so far. Here, with my personal top 10 for 2009, are a few thoughts for starters:    1 JENSON BUTTON  No1, without question. Scored the most points and made the fewest mistakes. Six impressive wins when the Brawn\u2011Mercedes was dominant and kept his nerve to pull off sharp, significant moves when it was not. Last Sunday&apos;s race erased lingering doubts with some of the best overtaking seen all year at a time when pressure was at its maximum; a champion performance.  2 LEWIS HAMILTON  Found difficulty in coping as defending champion with a car that initially was undrivable but he never gave anything less than his brilliant best. Carried the McLaren to places it had no right to be, qualifying fifth in Bahrain just one example. Ready for faultless wins in Hungary and Singapore. Scored more points than anyone since the end of July. Worst moments: &quot;Liargate&quot; scandal in Australia and potential Monaco victory lost through qualifying crash.  3 RUBENS BARRICHELLO  Perfect team player. Dominant wins on the streets of Valencia and at Monza as good as any and offset outbursts of frustration over failure to produce other victories that ought to have been his. May have out-qualified Button in the last six races but team-mate&apos;s ability to find more speed and consistency when it mattered denied Barrichello wins at crucial moments in Spain and Monaco.  4 SEBASTIAN VETTEL  The opposite to Button; qualified well but odd mistakes in races proved costly. Arguably the qualifying performance of the year to take pole in China when running limited by a technical problem to one lap. Repeatedly qualified the Red Bull in top four but compromised potential to add to peerless wins in China, Britain and Japan with errors in Australia, Malaysia, Monaco and Turkey.  5 MARK WEBBER  Did not have the necessary luck on his side. Championship momentum lost by being blocked by slower cars in Malaysia, Bahrain and Britain, and small but significant mistakes in three more races. His first two wins with Red Bull in 2009 have been the making of him and moulded a serious contender for 2010. A copybook win last Sunday went unnoticed in Button euphoria.  6 KIMI RAIKKONEN  His season came to life when Massa&apos;s accident in Hungary meant he no longer had to live in his shadow. Showed immense natural flair and continued to wring the Ferrari&apos;s neck to gain top-three finishes in Hungary, Valencia, Belgium and Italy despite knowing he will be replaced by Alonso in 2010. Win at Spa, making full use of Kers, one of the best.  7 FERNANDO ALONSO  His ability to extract the maximum from an average car saved the former champion from complete embarrassment. Sustained Renault through the &quot;Crashgate&quot; scandal, notably a brilliant third on the return to Singapore, the scene of the crime. Remains one of the best all-round drivers, which is why Ferrari signed the twice world champion for 2010.  8 TIMO GLOCK  The points do not show it but the German had impressive drives with a frequently average Toyota. Had to resort to running long stints \u2013 and made them work, back of the grid to 10th at Monaco and 13th to sixth in Hungary good examples. A reliable and fast performer now, with second in Singapore a highlight.  9 FELIPE MASSA  Who can say what the Brazilian might have done in the second half but for the accident in Hungary? Surprised many by outpacing Raikkonen. The abysmal failure of substitutes Badoer and Fisichella emphasised the good job he had been doing with a difficult car. Third place in Germany and fourth at Silverstone typical examples of tenacious drives.  10 NICO ROSBERG  Nearly but not quite. The Williams was not quite there and, when it was in Singapore, Rosberg threw away a potential win with a basic mistake leaving the pit lane. Mid\u2011season string of strong top-five finishes was as good as could be expected but, on other occasions, seemed resigned to a car with a narrow performance window. WORTH NOTING  Robert Kubica remains a star but had either appalling luck or a hopeless car. Pulled off the surprise of the season by somehow wrestling the BMW into second place last Sunday. Adrian Sutil&apos;s tremendous speed was compromised too often by impetuous mistakes in the Force India."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/27/somali-pirates-british-yacht", "sentences": ["Launching high-speed skiffs from previously captured &quot;mother ships&quot;, gunmen have seized vessels from Spain, Singapore and China in the region this month."], "publicationDate": "2009-10-27T16:24:00Z", "title": "Somali pirates claim to have seized British couple's yacht", "tags": ["Piracy at sea", "Somalia", "World news", "UK news", "Africa"], "article": "Rescuers were today searching for a British couple feared to have been kidnapped by pirates off the east coast of Africa. Paul and Rachel Chandler, who were sailing from the Seychelles to Tanzania, have not been heard from since Friday, when the emergency beacon on their yacht, the Lynn Rival, was activated. The British maritime and coastguard agency confirmed the beacon had been activated at 11pm on 23 October. Officials said the Seychelles authorities were carrying out a search and rescue operation in the area where the boat was last known to have been. It is understood pirate activity was reported in the region earlier that day. Reuters reported that the yacht had been seized by pirates and quoted one kidnapper, called Hassan, as saying: &quot;The British couple are in our hands now. We captured them as they were touring in the Indian Ocean.&quot; He said the captives were healthy and ransom demands would follow. The kidnap claim was echoed by Abdi Nor Osman, a self-proclaimed member of a pirate gang and resident of the coastal town of Haradhere, which is known to be a hotbed of pirate activity. Osman said that he had spoken to a member of the gang that claimed to have captured the boat, adding that eight pirates were aboard the yacht, which was towing two skiffs. He said the yacht was expected into port at Haradhere today. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said the reports were being investigated and that officials were in touch with relatives of the Chandlers, who are from Tunbridge Wells, in Kent. She said it was possible that the yacht had simply strayed out of contact, adding that there was no indication of pirate involvement other than that reported in the media. Combined Taskforce 151, an international naval response set up to combat Somali pirate attacks, is involved in the search, along with Nato and EU counter-piracy teams. A spokesman for the EU naval force said: &quot;Our ships will be scouring the seas on their normal passage and monitoring the airwaves.&quot; He said the British couple&apos;s yacht had gone missing in &quot;fairly dangerous waters&quot; but there had been no confirmation that it had been hijacked by pirates. A Royal Navy spokesman said HMS Cumberland was one of the ships involved in the piracy crackdown. &quot;We are doing everything we can to assist the Foreign Office in investigating this,&quot; he added. The couple&apos;s niece said that although the family had been alerted to the alarm signal on Friday, they had initially thought the situation was not serious. &quot;We were just waiting for them to come into docks because it tended to be the case that, out in the middle of the Indian Ocean, it was quite difficult to get hold of them and it was expected that they would dock at a little island,&quot; Leah Mickleborough told BBC Radio 5 Live. &quot;You never believe it&apos;s going to be one of those things that happens to your family. All of us as a family are extremely upset by what has happened. &quot;We are extremely distressed and it&apos;s such an emotional thing and such a horrible thing to be experiencing. I just hope they&apos;re OK. We all hope they are and that it can be resolved easily.&quot; Mickleborough said her uncle and aunt were passionate about sailing but were aware of its perils. &quot;This is their life, really,&quot; she said. &quot;They do sailing, they live for this. [But] they are not naive. They are very experienced in these things. &quot;They are not the sort of people who would put themselves deliberately in danger.&quot; A British coastguard spokesman said: &quot;They had left the Seychelles on 22 October and were going on a 150 nautical mile passage south-west to the Amirante Islands, en route to Tanzania. &quot;It would appear from the activation of the emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) that something has happened. &quot;We were aware that the EPIRB had gone off, talked to the Seychelles, asked if they were aware of it \u2026 they were, and have been searching by air and sea.&quot; A spokesman for the Seychelles coastguard said they did not have any information about the couple. &quot;We did have a distress signal from them on 23 October. There have been reports that they were hijacked by pirates, but no one can prove that,&quot; he said. &quot;Our ship is in the area, and we are still keeping a lookout. We don&apos;t know whether they were continuing with their route. They don&apos;t have a satellite phone, so we cannot get hold of them.&quot; The route would have taken the Chandlers, aged 58 and 55, near Somali waters notorious for pirate attacks on ships and smaller boats. The last message on the couple&apos;s travel blog was posted on Friday morning and read: &quot;Please ring Sarah.&quot; It is thought the message refers to Rachel&apos;s sister. Earlier, the Chandlers \u2013 who have been sailing around the world for several years after selling up in the UK \u2013 wrote of &quot;the Somali pirate problem&quot; that had delayed other voyages to Tanzania. Enthusiasts on a yachting forum questioned the wisdom of sailing in the area. One post said: &quot;I hope the people in question are well. However, I do wonder why anyone would sail through these areas. The dangers are very well known and very well reported.&quot; There have been a series of pirate attacks off Somalia in the last few years, with vessels from supertankers to cruise ships being targeted. Towards the end of last year, the situation became so bad that Maersk, the world&apos;s largest shipping company, announced that its oil tankers would be rerouted via the Cape of Good Hope. As the presence of foreign navies in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean off Somalia&apos;s coast has increased, pirate gangs have been operating further south towards the Mozambique Channel. The waters around the Seychelles are currently attractive to hijackers because of a return to calm seas following the monsoon season. Launching high-speed skiffs from previously captured &quot;mother ships&quot;, gunmen have seized vessels from Spain, Singapore and China in the region this month. Andrew Mwangura, head of the East African Seafarers&apos; Assistance Programme in Mombasa, said that while the Chandlers&apos; route from the Seychelles to Tanzania was not usually used by cargo ships, the most common target for pirates, it was well within attacking range. &quot;With sea conditions so good the area is very favourable to pirates right now. Nowhere off the coast of east Africa is safe,&quot; he said. If the yacht has been captured by pirates, it is most likely to be heading to Haradheere or Hobyo, both pirate havens on the Somali coast. Graeme Gibbon-Brooks, the managing director of Dryad Maritime Intelligence Service, based in Southampton, said that, while there was no confirmation pirates had taken the missing boat, &quot;it seems likely on the balance of probabilities&quot;. &quot;If this follows the normal pattern, the boat will be anchored off Somalia and the crew people taken ashore,&quot; he said. &quot;The question in this case is who will receive the ransom demand.

I was asleep and men with guns came aboard,&quot; he told ITV News. &quot;It was on Friday last week at 2.30am.&quot; Chandler said he and his wife were being held on a container ship called the Kota Wajar, a Singapore-flagged vessel that was captured by pirates two weeks ago. Asked whether their captors had asked for a ransom, he said: &quot;Not officially \u2013 they kept asking for money and took everything of value on the boat.&quot; The call was made from the captain&apos;s cabin of the Kota Wajar. &quot;We are hostage together with this ship,&quot; said Chandler, who added that they were about a mile off the coast of Somalia and the nearest town was Ubdu. Confirmation of the couple&apos;s captivity came amid reports this afternoon that Somali pirates had seized another vessel, with 25 Russians on board. According to the European Union&apos;s naval patrol force, pirates in two speedboats seized the Thai-registered boat about 200 miles north of the Seychelles and 650 miles east of the Somali coast. In the Chandler interview, ITV News&apos;s UK editor, Angus Walker, asked him how he was being treated, but the line was lost before Chandler could answer. Walker had begun the call by passing on a message from Mrs Chandler&apos;s brother, Stephen Collett. Walker said: &quot;Stephen says everyone here is fine, we are all thinking of you and just hope you are both well \u2013 can&apos;t wait to speak to you and see you.&quot; Mr Chandler replied: &quot;Well, that&apos;s awfully nice,&quot; and laughed. Gordon Brown appealed for the release of the couple and said: &quot;Piracy and the taking of hostages is unacceptable in any circumstances.&quot; David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said the UK condemned the action &quot;in the strongest possible terms&quot; and pledged that Britain would use &quot;all the mechanisms at our disposal&quot; to secure the Chandlers&apos; safe return. The Whitehall emergency committee, Cobra, met this morning to investigate how best to bring about the release of the coule. Earlier, the Ministry of Defence said a Royal Navy ship searching for the couple had found the Chandlers&apos; empty yacht. &quot;We can confirm that a ship encountered a yacht believed to belong to Paul and Rachel Chandler in international waters,&quot; an MoD spokesman said. &quot;[The Chandlers] were not aboard the yacht; no one was.&quot; Paul Chandler is a former quantity surveyor and Rachel Chandler an economist. They had not been heard from since last Friday, when the emergency beacon was activated on their yacht, the Lynn Rival. A Somali fisherman told the Associated Press that two boats carrying eight pirates and a white couple had arrived early today in the village of Ceel Huur, north of the pirate stronghold town of Haradhere. Dahir Dabadhahan said a convoy of about 30 other pirates in six luxury vehicles met the group in front of fishermen who were preparing their boats of the day. Russia&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Andrei Nesterenko, said Moscow had learned of the latest hijacking from the EU&apos;s naval force, which is patrolling the Indian Ocean waters around Somalia. Russia was urgently seeking more details about the incident from its embassies in east African countries bordering Somalia, and from the Seychelles, he said. According to the naval forces&apos; website, the fishing vessel \u2013 Thai Union 3 \u2013 was hijacked early this morning. &quot;Adding this fishing vessel to the total number, this makes eight ships in total held by criminals at the Somali coastline,&quot; the website said. One Russian maritime expert cast doubt on claims that the latest pirate victims were Russians. &quot;It&apos;s doubtful there would be a Russian crew aboard a Thai-registered vessel,&quot; said Mikhail Voitenko, a journalist who raised the alert following the disappearance of the Russian cargo ship Arctic Sea. &quot;Vietnamese, it can happen, but not Thai.

Lord Jopling, who also wrote a report into money laundering and terrorism for the House of Lords, has warned that paying off pirates could encourage terrorist groups into further acts of piracy. His comments come after the demand for $7m (\u00a34.2m) for the safe return of Paul and Rachel Chandler, the British couple taken hostage nine days ago as they travelled from the Seychelles to Tanzania. Almost 300 pirate attacks were logged worldwide in 2008 alone. At present, British law allows ship owners to pay ransoms for the release of hijacked vessels. But if the government established a link between the pirates and terrorist groups, the payment of ransoms would be considered as funding terrorism and be banned by law. Jopling, the author of the Nato report The Growing Threat Of Piracy, said that many people suspect terrorist groups are behind the capture of dozens of ships off the Horn of Africa. He called on the government to put &quot;more effort&quot; into finding out whether there is a link to terrorism. &quot;There is as yet no evidence that money goes to terrorists, but given all of the rumours that al-Qaida has active cells in Somalia, it would not be of huge surprise if there is a connection there. We will not find out until the government takes the initiative with other interested states to find out and look at the magnitude of the sums involved and where the money is going. It is of concern.&quot; The Home Office promised in June to investigate possible links between pirates in the Gulf of Aden and Somali terrorist movements such as Al-Shabab, widely thought to be part of al-Qaida. In July, the House of Lords&apos; European Union committee published a report on terrorism funding that voiced concern over the lack of information about a pirate-terrorist connection. In Washington, the Treasury Department asked the Office of Foreign Assets Control to investigate how Al-Shabab is financed. The initiatives have stirred some concern in the City, headquarters of London&apos;s leading law firms and maritime insurance groups. Ship owners who pay ransoms that are reimbursed by insurance groups are not obliged to file a suspicious activity report with the Serious and Organised Crime Agency. This summer the Lords sought to change the law by authorising courts to start proceedings against companies paying ransoms without telling the British authorities. But the Home Office said in a response to the Lords report last month &quot;it isn&apos;t up to the government&quot; to issue rules on suspicious activity reports. The empty yacht belonging to the Chandlers, who are from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was found during counter-piracy operations. The couple are being held on the Kota Wajar container ship, which is registered in Singapore and owned by one of the world&apos;s largest shipping companies, Pacific International Lines. The company is believed to be talking to the pirates to negotiate a ransom that will include the Kota Wajar, which has also been seized by the pirates, and its crew as well as the Chandlers. The ransom demand for the return of the couple was made on Friday in a call to the BBC in which the pirates&apos; representative blamed Nato operations in the area for destroying the local economy. &quot;Nato operations have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to poor fishermen... they illegally transfer the fishermen to their own prisons and prisons of other [foreign] countries.&quot; A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed it had employed a negotiator and said: &quot;We are aware of reports that a ransom demand of $7m has been made. HMG&apos;s policy remains clear: We will not make substantive concessions to hostage takers, including the payment of ransoms.&quot; The brother of Rachel Chandler, Stephen Collett, told the Observer the Foreign Office was doing an &quot;excellent&quot; job."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/01/ian-poulter-wins-singapore-open", "sentences": ["Ian Poulter is already looking forward to next year&apos;s Ryder Cup after winning the Singapore Open today, finishing with a one-over 72 to edge out China&apos;s Liang Wen-chong by a shot."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-01T10:47:13Z", "title": "Ian Poulter sets sights on Ryder Cup after Singapore Open victory", "tags": ["Ian Poulter", "Ryder Cup", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Ian Poulter is already looking forward to next year&apos;s Ryder Cup after winning the Singapore Open today, finishing with a one-over 72 to edge out China&apos;s Liang Wen-chong by a shot.

In an effort to stem the conflict, the United Nations imposed an arms embargo on both the government and the rebels. Both parties contravened the international decision during the second (1992-94) and third (1998-2002) periods of the civil war. The Angolan government employed primarily the services of Pierre Falcone and Gaydamak to procure the arms, while the main arms dealer supplying Unita rebels was the infamous Ukrainian Victor Bout, who is currently sitting in jail in Thailand. In order to understand the significance of these convictions it is important to focus on one key player, Pierre Falcone, and his relationship with the Angolan leadership. The Angolan president, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, publicly hailed him as a national hero. Critical newspapers dubbed him as the &quot;vice-president of Angola&quot; for his privileged access to the president, and for his handling of sovereign state affairs. His influence made a laughing-stock of the former Angolan prime minister Marcolino Moco, who had only two private audiences with Dos Santos during his four years in the job. It coincided with the period of arms trafficking for which Falcone has just been convicted. In 2004, for instance, Dos Santos&apos; office called for the prosecution of Falcone to be abandoned:  During a difficult moment of the recent Angolan history, Mr Pierre Falcone, by his volition and at his own risk, made funds available to the Angolan government for it to exercise its right of sovereignty, a right that was almost denied by the international community. It was, thus, decisive, at that time, the financial support from some private entities.  The ideological divide of the cold war had enabled the MPLA regime to seek international military protection from Cuba and the former Soviet Union between 1975, the year of Angola&apos;s independence, and 1989. Economic liberalisation and the new world order led Dos Santos to shift, during the 1992 post-electoral civil war, to the use of private foreign intermediaries to perform sovereign responsibilities and to enable the ruling elite to enrich themselves illicitly, including the presidential family. Angola&apos;s riches sustained and prolonged the civil war. The government traded oil for weapons, while Unita paid for arms with diamonds. These deals fuelled the conflict and contributed to the killings of tens of thousands of Angolans, the devastation of the country&apos;s infrastructure, and helped to institutionalise corruption. Furthermore, the corrupt channels established by arms trade, oil and diamonds set the stage for a culture of impunity, plunder of the state assets by the ruling elite, and the &quot;legalisation&quot; of such criminal acts in peace time. It is in this context that Falcone has also become a key player in Angola&apos;s state contracts with China, which are worth billions of dollars. His conviction is a serious blow to Dos Santos&apos; arrogance as an untouchable political figure. It imperils the president&apos;s form of private indirect government \u2013 a term used by the academic Achille Mbembe to describe the privatisation of sovereignty as its various functions and obligations are transferred to private operators and for private ends. * This article was amended shortly after publication.

Playing the sort of relentless &quot;fairways and greens&quot; golf that tends to succeed in head-to-head contests \u2013 only once did Fisher drop a shot to par \u2013 the 28-year-old from Wentworth, the long-time home of this event, eventually wore down his younger opponent. All square at lunch having never been down, Fisher was soon three up. A birdie at the par-five third, an eagle at the 334-yard fourth, where both players found the putting surface with their tee-shots, and another birdie-four at the long fifth all proved too good for Kim. The most crucial three-hole period of the match, however, had yet to come. Still two up playing the 494-yard seventh, Fisher bunkered his approach with his opponent already aboard the putting surface in regulation. Then, in what was something of a comedy of errors, Kim three-putted and Fisher, after splashing out to no more than three feet, almost did likewise. One hole later, Kim missed from inside two feet when holing out would have reduced the deficit. Then, with his opponent all but sure of a birdie at the 352-yard ninth, Fisher holed from all of 30 feet to maintain his two-hole advantage. Having survived unscathed that brief excursion into mild farce, Fisher took the short 10th with a par and five holes later closed out the match, in the process making himself the fourth Englishman to lift one of European golf&apos;s most prestigious titles. Nick Faldo (1989 and 1992) was first, followed by Lee Westwood (2000) and Paul Casey (2006). &quot;This is a massive confidence boost for me,&quot; said the new champion, who displayed a promising propensity for head-to-head contests when he made it to the semi-final of the World Golf Championship Accenture Match Play in February. &quot;I felt like I played well and did a good job of putting the pressure on him,&quot; added Fisher. &quot;I was relieved to get to three up though. At that point I knew I just had to finish the job off. &quot;I could have won every major this year if things had gone my way \u2013 I led all four at some point \u2013 so I&apos;ve been very consistent without winning. But this is a big step up for me. Anything with the word &apos;world&apos; in the title has to mean a great deal.&quot; It was not all bad news for Kim, either. Although disappointed to have lost, the young and sometimes volatile Californian was heartened by further confirmation of his recent return to something like the form that saw him win twice on the PGA Tour in 2008 and crush the formidable Sergio Garc\u00eda in the Ryder Cup at Valhalla. The runner&apos;s-up cheque for \u20ac450,000 (capped to \u20ac361,408 for the purposes of the money list) means he comfortably qualifies for the $7.5m Dubai World Championship later this month. In all probability, he will be the only American in the elite 60-strong field. &quot;I gave it all I had but unfortunately it wasn&apos;t good enough,&quot; Kim said with a sigh. &quot;It was an up-and-down battle all day and I never seemed to get anything going. All credit to Ross though; he played great.&quot; Meanwhile, in the other game played today, Robert Allenby was 10 under par \u2013 his day&apos;s work included a hole-in-one at the 230-yard sixth \u2013 for the 19 holes it took to overcome the Masters champion Angel Cabrera from Argentina in the play-off for third and fourth places.

The proposed 50p-a-month levy on all UK phone lines is set to be contained in this year&apos;s finance bill and is designed to help fund the development of superfast broadband networks. But Dunstone complains the tax has not been the subject of any public consultation. &quot;This is an unjust and regressive tax on all phone customers which will subsidise mostly richer rural households that can afford high priced super fast broadband services,&quot; he said. &quot;As well as being unfair we estimate that the increase in price will mean that over 100,000 mostly low income homes will be forced to give up their broadband lines. This is wholly inconsistent with the government&apos;s plans to tackle digital exclusion.&quot; TalkTalk says its estimate is based on experience of customer behaviour when prices rise. It says the tax equates to a 3% price rise on a typical package, which translates into a 0.6% fall in demand, or about 120,000 broadband homes. Dunstone said that instead of a new tax, the private sector should be left to drive next generation broadband . &quot;Crucially the scheme is likely to delay next generation broadband roll-out in rural areas rather than hasten it as private investors will wait for public funds to be made available,&quot; he argued. &quot;Public funding at this stage \u2013 in what appears to be an effort to &apos;keep up with the Joneses&apos; in Korea, Singapore and the Netherlands \u2013 is simply going to waste customers&apos; money and slow down roll-out.&quot; Lord Carter, the former communications minister who introduced the broadband tax plan in his Digital Britain report this summer, argued that it was the most transparent way of investing in a critical part of Britain&apos;s infrastructure.

But in the absence of any significant competition, Will Alsop persists in fitting the bill. What&apos;s he done this time? Not a new, eyebrow-raising ensemble of his trademark blobs and stilts, nor a provocative proposal to rebuild Croydon out of cheese (in 2007, he suggested flooding the south London suburb as part of a regeneration scheme). In fact, he&apos;s done the very opposite: in August, Alsop announced in the Guardian that\u00a0he was giving up architecture altogether. He was going to teach instead, as well as launch &quot;a serious inquiry into painting&quot;. It was a dramatic end to a career, although not\u00a0an entirely surprising one. Alsop&apos;s love of painting is well known, and financial difficulties had already forced him to sell his practice to a larger firm a\u00a0few years back. Now architecture had\u00a0become &quot;like pulling teeth&quot;, he\u00a0complained. But three months after his shock exit, Alsop is back. He has opened a new office under the umbrella of RMJM, another major British architectural firm. It turns out that the &quot;going off to paint&quot; line was just a ruse to throw his previous employers, Archial, off the scent, while he did some behind-the-scenes manoeuvring. He smirks when I ask him to explain himself. &quot;A: I didn&apos;t lie, and B: I have no obligation to the press,&quot; he says. &quot;I\u00a0was painting, and there&apos;s quite a bit of work in my Norfolk studio to prove it. On the other hand, you could say I\u00a0always paint anyway. I&apos;ve also been doing a little bit more teaching, at Ryerson University in Toronto. So I wasn&apos;t lying there. It&apos;s just that I didn&apos;t say what else I was doing.&quot; He is now heading up RMJM&apos;s London office, which is to be known as &quot;Will Alsop at RMJM&quot; (&quot;It sounds a bit like Gordon Ramsay at Claridges, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;). For the moment, his new Battersea studio looks more like a workers&apos; canteen; the former industrial space is still mostly empty desks. There are fewer than 10 employees here, and one telephone line, although they will soon be joined by staff from RMJM&apos;s existing office in east London. There is, however, a chipboard wall already plastered with plans and sections of a new skyscraper (new projects in the Middle East and South Korea is all he will reveal), while a few of Alsop&apos;s large, colourful, semi-abstract paintings lean against the walls. &quot;Once we&apos;ve got it organised, it&apos;ll feel like an Alsop studio,&quot; he says. &quot;Paintings and models, slightly scruffy, which I think is important. This space isn&apos;t roughed up enough yet. It should feel like a workshop.&quot; Alsop has always been the frustrated-artist type of architect. His built work is like his paintings: full of bold gestures, bright colours and patterns. When it works, it&apos;s playful and unique, like his Stirling prize-winning Peckham Library in south London, with its copper-green cladding and jaunty orange &quot;beret&quot; sitting on top, the whole top-heavy form held up by wonky stilts. When it doesn&apos;t work, the failure is all the more public, as with, The Public, West Bromwich&apos;s faltering interactive art gallery, where Alsop&apos;s brash black-and-pink, blobs-and-all design only drew more attention to its technical and financial troubles. The Public is now up and running, at last, but not before it had made another dent in Alsop&apos;s increasingly battered reputation. Even with a bog standard building type, you can count\u00a0on Alsop to inject some of his considerable personality into it, as with\u00a0his recent Palestra in south London \u2013 a top-heavy\u00a0office block with\u00a0jazzy glazing patterns, or his new Chips apartment block in Manchester, its bright-coloured facades emblazoned with giant lettering. Marking your spot on earth Alsop doesn&apos;t see the point of architecture that simply blends in. &quot;I\u00a0have done lots of work with the general public, and what I hear over and over again is that people are looking for something that marks their spot on the earth&apos;s surface. Something that has an identity which they don&apos;t share with others,&quot; he says. The trouble is, it&apos;s become harder and harder for him to be the free-thinking architect. &quot;Very often the principal [architect] spends more time filling in VAT returns than getting on with what they spent seven years training to do,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s distracting. You need time and you need relative relaxation in order to work your way into a project, and if you don&apos;t do that you just end up repeating what you&apos;ve already done.&quot; Perhaps if Alsop had spent a little more time filling in those VAT returns, he might still be running his own practice. For 25 years he worked independently, his career a steady accumulation of awards and bigger commissions \u2013 until about a decade ago. The tipping point was probably a commission for the &quot;Fourth Grace&quot; for Liverpool&apos;s historic waterfront: Alsop beat Norman Foster and Richard Rogers to win the prestigious competition with his radical &quot;cloud&quot; structure, but it proved a poisoned chalice. His design drew fierce public criticism, major changes were called for, costs spiralled, and then finally the scheme was shelved in 2004. Several other projects fell through shortly afterwards (a building in Bangkok, a development in Manchester) , and there just wasn&apos;t enough money to see the practice through its lean patch. &quot;We should have been covered and we were not covered financially. That pissed me off,&quot; he says. &quot;I paid the price for my disinterest in that side of architecture \u2013 as a business.&quot; In 2005, Alsop sold a 40% stake in his firm to venture capitalists. A year later, Alsop Architects was bought in its entirety by SMC, a publicly listed new architectural group that was then aggressively acquiring small regional British practices. Within a couple of years, SMC became the fourth largest architectural firm in the country, with Alsop the jewel in its crown. But they were plagued by internal issues that saw SMC&apos;s founder, Stuart McColl, ejected and the name changed to Archial. Then the credit crunch bit, and Archial posted a loss of \u00a34.3m for the first half of this year. &quot;I don&apos;t think the plc as a model works very well in architecture,&quot; Alsop says of SMC/Archial. &quot;Rather than architectural intent, a number of decisions were made purely on a financial basis. The main board only had one architect on it.&quot; Alsop still had creative freedom, but his offices in Toronto and Singapore were closed down. &quot;I had my wings clipped.&quot; Did it become acrimonious? &quot;No,&quot; he smiles. &quot;Just boring.&quot; On the face of it, there&apos;s not a huge difference between Alsop&apos;s previous role and his new one. But RMJM has a better pedigree: it was one of the key modernist firms of the 1950s and 60s, and has made a huge impression on the\u00a0landscape of postwar Britain, from university campuses and housing estates to London&apos;s Commonwealth Institute, right up to the Scottish Parliament. Like SMC, it has also stepped up its expansion drive under new CEO Robert Morrison (a former army officer and a non-architect). Morrison thinks the industry is due for\u00a0a major shake-up. &quot;You saw it in marketing in the 70s, where WSP and Saatchi came along and looked at an industry which was largely made up of\u00a0small companies. This is a very fragmented sector, and I strongly believe that over the next decade or two that&apos;s got to change dramatically, and the emergence of one or two superfirms is an inevitability.&quot; As well as Alsop, RMJM has collaborated with other well-known architects, such as Frank Gehry and Jean Nouvel, although nothing has yet\u00a0come of these partnerships. Perhaps Morrison&apos;s vision really is the\u00a0future of architecture: a handful of\u00a0global &quot;superfirms&quot; with the odd star name attached for a dash of creative flair. But most architects hope\u00a0not. Drawing, painting, dreaming Only 10% of RMJM&apos;s work is now in the\u00a0UK;\u00a0it is involved in several major international projects, such as Gazprom&apos;s controversial skyscraper in\u00a0St Petersburg. Critics say the firm&apos;s growth has come at the cost of its identity, and that it is producing less remarkable work these days. Of course, it would be good to see Alsop return to form. His Stirling Prize was nearly 10 years ago. But even if he&apos;s no longer quite the enfant, his appetite for the terrible seems to be undiminished. He&apos;s looking forward to doing what he\u00a0enjoys most: &quot;drawing, painting, dreaming and working on architecture&quot;, albeit with the benefit of\u00a0a\u00a0large safety net. Professionally, this new marriage might turn out to be a happy one. Or it\u00a0might last as long as Alsop&apos;s previous\u00a0engagement. Either way, there is no chance of him ever really giving up architecture to go off and paint, Alsop admits. He will never retire. &quot;Painting to me is a\u00a0way of exploring architecture, anyway,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s all the same thing. If I\u00a0spent all my time painting, it\u00a0wouldn&apos;t mean I&apos;d given up thinking about architecture. I can sit in my studio on a Saturday morning and find something on a large piece of paper, and the feeling that you get is almost as\u00a0good as having finished a building that&apos;s turned out all right. It&apos;s not about designing something, it&apos;s about\u00a0discovering what something could be \u2013 and I think that&apos;s a very important distinction.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/nov/02/formula-one-2009-season-in-review", "sentences": ["The reason for Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s retirement from the 2008 Singapore grand prix had seemed clear-cut; the novice had lost control of his Renault and smashed into the wall.", "This will revisit the staged crash by Nelson Piquet Jr that gave victory to his Renault team-mate in the 2008 Singapore grand prix."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-02T22:47:00Z", "title": "After a season in which scandal eclipsed drama there is no peace in sight forFormula One | Maurice Hamilton", "tags": ["Formula One", "Jenson Button", "Brawn", "Lewis Hamilton", "McLaren", "Sebastian Vettel", "Red Bull", "Bernie Ecclestone", "Silverstone", "British Grand Prix", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "The contrast between the post-race scenes at the opening grand prix of the season in Australia and Sunday&apos;s finale in Abu Dhabi could not have been more extreme. The balmy Middle East evening rounded off a weekend that had worked perfectly, provided a dramatic chase involving the new world champion and finished with tearful farewells and not a hint of protest or complaint. Compare this to Melbourne on 29 March and a chilly evening with a nasty edge that would slash its way through much of the season with such devastating effect that 2009 will be remembered for the politics just as much as Jenson Button&apos;s drawn-out but well-deserved championship. Button&apos;s fairy tale started in Melbourne as the Brawn team confounded every prediction by winning a race they did not expect to be in, never mind dominate from start to finish. The former Honda team had been without an owner since December 2008 but rivals&apos; pleasure at having Ross Brawn&apos;s buy-out keep the entry healthy took on a more cynical dimension when Brawn&apos;s cars proved to be indecently quick. Brawn&apos;s aerodynamicists had discovered a loophole buried within technical changes demanded by the 2009 regulations. The addition of a so-called double-diffuser at the rear brought superior grip and performance when cornering. Brawn were not alone in their discovery but made the diffuser work better than anyone else. Protests and complaints came thick and fast from the seven teams that had either considered the double diffuser illegal or missed it altogether. Brawn would win the day in every sense by making the most of their advantage while the rest caught up. Had the stewards&apos; decision gone the other way, it is likely that Red Bull \u2013 the best car without a diffuser \u2013 would have walked the championship rather than losing time making the necessary modifications and giving Brawn a hint of what might have been by winning six races, including the final three. The surprise over Brawn&apos;s rush to the front was matched by McLaren&apos;s messy nose-dive to the back. The McLaren-Mercedes was hopeless but, just as Lewis Hamilton thought life could not get any tougher for a reigning world champion, a simple event occurred that would have huge repercussions. Having qualified 18th in Melbourne, Hamilton was happy to find himself in fourth place when the safety car appeared with a few laps remaining. That became third when Jarno Trulli slid off the road, leaving Hamilton with no alternative but to overtake the Toyota, even though such a move is technically forbidden in a safety car situation. McLaren, desperate not to suffer a heavy penalty, ordered Hamilton to allow Trulli, who had regained the track, to return to third. Detail of this verbal instruction was not passed on to the race stewards \u2013 or never asked for by them in a proper manner \u2013 as Trulli was penalised for having overtaken the McLaren. When McLaren&apos;s radio transmission came to light, Hamilton and McLaren&apos;s team manager, Dave Ryan, were hauled before the stewards at the following race in Malaysia. Ryan was sacked and Hamilton&apos;s subsequent press conference, one of the most toe-curling moments in the history of the sport, presented the view that he had been told to lie. There are some within Formula One who remain convinced that Ryan, a McLaren employee with an impeccable record, was made a scapegoat, as was the team principal, Ron Dennis, who, allegedly by coincidence and nothing to do with the foregoing, suddenly left the team he adored to look after other aspects of McLaren&apos;s business. McLaren responded in the best way by making the recovery of the season. They returned to basics with the car and put the smile back on Hamilton&apos;s face as he won twice and scored more points than any other driver in the second half of the season. Hamilton would have challenged Sebastian Vettel for the win on Sunday had he not suffered his first retirement in three years with mechanical trouble. Even as McLaren packed up on Sunday, they did not know why one of Hamilton&apos;s rear brake discs had worn excessively. The reason for Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s retirement from the 2008 Singapore grand prix had seemed clear-cut; the novice had lost control of his Renault and smashed into the wall. That much was true. But, in one of the biggest scandals to rock the sport, it emerged almost 12 months later that Piquet had been ordered to crash and engineer circumstances that would hand victory to Fernando Alonso in the other Renault. Compared with this, McLaren&apos;s problems in Melbourne, and with the &apos;Spygate&apos; affair in 2007, were small beer. Yet Renault received a mere reprimand, although the team principal, Flavio Briatore, was banned for life. Dennis reappeared in Abu Dhabi, not in a management role with his team but, coincidentally, at the first race without Max Mosley as the FIA&apos;s controversial president. Mosley&apos;s successor, Jean Todt, was on hand, beaming at all and sundry. It matched the mood of the moment and it is to be hoped this will continue into 2010. But, being F1, you have to doubt it. Five things to be resolved before the start of the 2010 F1 season Drivers Jenson Button and Brawn need to sort out their financial differences. Button took a voluntary \u00a35m pay cut to help out the team in 2009, a sacrifice that paid off for all concerned. The least he expects is a return to the original \u00a38m agreed figure. Brawn say they have not got the money but are &quot;90% certain&quot; the deal will be done. As Christian Horner, boss of Red Bull said: &quot;What&apos;s the matter with them? They&apos;re world champions. They should do the deal.&quot; Button&apos;s best option is limited to McLaren, as a partner to Lewis Hamilton. &quot;If I was Jenson, I wouldn&apos;t do that,&quot; said Sir Jackie Stewart. &quot;When I was racing, there was no way I would have joined Lotus, even though it was a very competitive team. But it was Jim Clark&apos;s team; it had been built around him. It&apos;s the same with McLaren and Lewis. Jenson doesn&apos;t need that.&quot; Races Bernie Ecclestone and Silverstone must come to terms \u2013 and quickly. The demise of Donington and a saga that ended in failure to raise \u00a3134m leaves the British grand prix without a home for 2010. Silverstone, having been snubbed by Ecclestone in favour of an optimistic 17-year deal with their East Midlands rival, must resist the temptation to squeeze Ecclestone&apos;s assets in public as he faces being blamed for removing one of Formula One&apos;s classic venues from the calendar. Each side needs to allow the other to avoid a loss of face. But time is running out and Silverstone must get going soon in order to meet the July date. The Northamptonshire track also needs more than a lick of paint for many parts that have fallen behind Formula One&apos;s standards. Teams Plans to expand the entry for 2010 and welcome four new teams \u2013 Lotus (no relation to the former champions), Campos Meta, US F1 and Manor \u2013 are not as straightforward as they seem. It was one thing to make plans for such a big step when there was talk of a \u00a340m ceiling on expenditure; quite another to enter such an intensely competitive arena when the budget cap disappeared during the struggle for power between the existing 10 teams of the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) and the FIA. Newcomers now face spending twice as much as planned and there are doubts if they can afford it. BMW-Sauber, on the sidelines following BMW&apos;s withdrawal and the purchase of the remnants by the dubious Qadbak company, await a slot created by the non-arrival of one of the four. Fota, as yet, does not have unanimous agreement to expand the entry beyond 14 to allow Sauber back on board. Administration Jean Todt faces a sceptical Formula One world after his election as successor to Mosley as president of the FIA. Todt was known for his obdurate ways at team meetings when running Ferrari but he must call on the same brilliant skills as administrator and motivator which brought such success to the Italian team. Todt&apos;s first task is to prove he has no bias towards his former employer and that he is free of Mosley&apos;s pervasive influence and controversial administration. Formula One needs to move away from confrontational methods governance and it will be Todt&apos;s job to ensure that the stewardship of races is fair and avoids dragging the sport through its courts in such a public manner. Todt is more than capable but his intent must be clear before the 2010 season gets motoring. Flavio Briatore Flavio Briatore commenced legal proceedings against the governing body at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris in an attempt to have the lifetime ban against him overturned. A preliminary hearing in Paris confirmed a date for 24 November. This will revisit the staged crash by Nelson Piquet Jr that gave victory to his Renault team-mate in the 2008 Singapore grand prix. Briatore&apos;s exceptional ban excludes the Italian from many other facets of his management business and has been seen by some cynics as a Mosley-inspired punishment for Briatore being a leading force in a planned breakaway by Fota in July. This matter needs to be concluded, one way or the other."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/06/renault-formula-one", "sentences": ["Although the Renault factory team had a dismal 2009 season with Fernando Alonso scoring their only podium finish with third place in the Singapore grand prix, rivals Red Bull used their engines to win six grands prix with Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber and have re-signed to continue supplying the Milton Keynes-based team next season.", "Earlier this year the Renault were also given a suspended indefinite ban from formula one after it was proved that Nelson Piquet Jr was asked to crash deliberately at Singapore in 2008, tactically advantaging Alonso who went on to win the race."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-06T00:14:22Z", "title": "Renault postpone decision on their future in formula one", "tags": ["Renault", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Formula One 2009"], "article": "Renault have postponed making an official decision on whether or not to follow Honda, BMW and Toyota out of formula one until the end of the year.

According to consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers, the economic growth of many cities in the emerging world is so much stronger than that in many developed economies that the league table of the world&apos;s great cities is going to change radically between now and 2025. Shanghai is set to rise from 25th place to 9th by then, with Mumbai likely to storm to 11th in the global gross domestic product per capita rankings from its current slot at number 29.

But, says PwC, systematic global data on the size of city economies has been lacking until now. PwC published the first set of global city GDP rankings in 2007 and has now updated these to 2008 with projections to 2025. Thomas Hoehn, an economics partner at PwC, added: &quot;Global economic activity is concentrated in the world&apos;s largest cities and it is important to understand how those cities compare, especially when many developed economies are experiencing economic difficulties while countries like China and India continue to grow.&quot; Delhi, Guangzhou and Rio de Janeiro are all likely to rise rapidly up the table between now and 2025, PwC says, as are Istanbul and Cairo. Lots of American and European cities, however, are set to slide sharply over the same period, with cities like Sydney, Singapore and Madrid likely to drop out of the top 30 altogether.

Seoul-based news agency Yonhap quoted South Korea&apos;s prime minister, Chung Un-chan, as telling politicians that the skirmish was accidental. The north&apos;s military issued a statement blaming the south&apos;s ship for crossing the border and demanding an apology. The clash comes days ahead of Barack Obama&apos;s visit to Asia, including South Korea, and as Pyongyang seeks direct talks with his US administration. But while some experts suggested Pyongyang might be seeking to increase pressure for bilateral discussions \u2013 noting its recent statement that it had produced more arms-grade plutonium \u2013 others said it had been concentrating on making friendly overtures and suggested the incident may have been accidental. Bloomberg and Associated Press cited unnamed White House officials as confirming that the special envoy would go to Pyongyang for bilateral talks. According to a statement from South Korea&apos;s joint chiefs of staff, the North Korean patrol boat crossed the disputed western sea border at around 11.30am local time, ignoring warning shots from the southern vessel. The North Korean boat then opened fire and the South Korean ship returned fire before the north&apos;s vessel returned to its waters, the statement said. The incident lasted about two minutes. The clash occurred near the south-held island of Daecheong, about 120 nautical miles (220km) off Incheon, west of Seoul. A military officer, speaking anonymously, told AP that the north&apos;s ship was badly damaged. The north has not commented on casualties. The maritime demarcation border, the Northern Limit Line, was drawn by the then commander of United Nations forces at the end of the civil war in 1953. The two Koreas have never agreed upon it and frequently accuse each other of violating it; Pyongyang last month complained again that South Korean warships were entering its territory. The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, who convened an emergency security meeting, ordered his defence minister to strengthen military readiness. But there were no signs of tension along the Korean peninsula&apos;s heavily fortified land border. &quot;North Korea is taking this aggressive stance to show they&apos;re not backing down on their security,&quot; Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Reuters. But Han Seung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, said: &quot;There is no reason now for either North or South Korea to be provocative. Right now, the north is sending out overtures to the US for bilateral talks and also to start some sort of dialogue with the US.&quot; Pyongyang has long sought direct talks with Washington and attacked the six-nation negotiations on aid in return for the north&apos;s denuclearisation, which it says infringed its sovereignty. The US has said that any bilateral discussions must be within the context of the multiparty framework, which includes South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. Han warned: &quot;I doubt if they would come back to six-party talks with just one visit by Stephen Bosworth [the US special envoy for North Korea].

Now, the optician said, I&apos;d be able to see again \u2013 but only by attaching to my head what looked like an instrument of torture designed to extract the maximum potential for teasing. With their thick curved lenses and speckled green frames, my first glasses looked like something Timmy Mallett would wear. And that was definitely not a good thing. Now, it seems, increasing numbers of children and teenagers are sharing my pain. Over the last couple of decades, there&apos;s been a massive surge in short-sightedness in young people around the world (the condition is usually diagnosed in teenagers). According to New Scientist, 80% of young adults now need glasses in Asian countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2013 so many that you wonder whether the teasing tables have been turned (do the kids with 20-20 vision get called &quot;two-eyed&quot;?). Rates are lower over here \u2013 between 30 and 50% \u2013 but ophthalmologists agree that myopia is on the rise. &quot;We can&apos;t be sure of the numbers,&quot; says Winfried Amoaku, consultant ophthalmologist at Queen&apos;s Medical Centre in Nottingham, &quot;but the increase in myopia, especially in eastern countries, really is quite rampant.&quot; So what lies behind this myopia epidemic? The traditional explanation has been reading, which some scientists think can cause the lenses in children&apos;s eyes to elongate, blurring the image recorded by the retina. Myopia does still seem to afflict bookish types more (just glance round your local library), but no one has found a definitive link. &quot;Being short-sighted does not,&quot; Amoaku explains curtly, &quot;mark you out as an intellectual.&quot; Kids have been reading for centuries, anyway \u2013 and most prefer TVs and computers these days. So are screens to blame? Most ophthalmologists agree that excessive screen-watching can accelerate myopia \u2013 though Amoaku says it&apos;s fine as long as you stay at &quot;piano-distance&quot; from the screen (defined, quaintly, as the distance you&apos;d sit from an upright piano). The fall-off in school sport could also be a factor. Playing sport does seem to have a positive effect on children&apos;s eye health: one recent American study of eight-year-olds found that around one in five became myopic within four years \u2013 and almost all of those that did played little or no sport. But even more remarkably, our increasing tendency to keep kids indoors could actually be to blame. In a recent study of more than 2,000 12-year-old Australians, playing sport indoors turned out to be of no benefit for the eyes \u2013 but sitting around in the fresh air was. Diet could also play a part. In 2002, the American evolutionary biologist Loren Cordain linked myopia with a high-carb diet, though that doesn&apos;t explain why the Asian diet \u2013 traditionally carbohydrate-rich \u2013 should only now be affecting sight. For Amoaku, then, the answer is to &quot;do all the normal, healthy things, with a good diet and exercise&quot;. And even if that doesn&apos;t work, most short-sighted kids will eventually find \u2013 as I did \u2013 that wearing glasses is really nothing to cry about."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/12/us-envoy-objects-afghan-surge", "sentences": ["Obama is scheduled to arrive in Japan tomorrow at the start of a nine-day tour of east Asia, including visits to Singapore, South Korea and Japan."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T07:56:22Z", "title": "US envoy warns against troop surge in Afghanistan", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "US news", "US national security", "World news", "Nato"], "article": "The US ambassador in Kabul has warned against plans to send tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan, until President Hamid Karzai&apos;s government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle the corruption. Karl Eikenberry sent two classified cables to Washington in the past week expressing his concern over proposals to deploy as many as 40,000 extra troops while the Karzai government remains dogged by accusations of incompetence and corruption, according to reports from Washington. The existence of the memos was revealed as Barack Obama held a war council at the White House to discuss the final four options for deployment of extra US troops in an effort to stave off defeat at the hands of the Taliban. Eikenberry is a former US commander in Afghanistan and his caution over a further troop build-up puts him at odd with senior generals in the Pentagon. The BBC said today that it had been told Eikenberry had gone so far as to say it was &quot;not a good idea&quot; to send more troops. Officials said a troop increase has been agreed in principle and what was left to be resolved was the number and how they would fit into the existing strategic aims. The US commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, has asked for 40,000 extra US troops for Afghanistan on top of the 68,000 that will have been deployed by the end of the year, and warned that without them the US was staring at defeat. The New York Times reported that Eikenberry&apos;s reservations were raised last week , and that Obama and his security advisers have examined an option that would send about 10-15,000 new troops , most designated as trainers for Afghan forces. The &apos;low-end&apos; option joined alternatives calling for troop level rises of around 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000, according to the paper, which said it had talked to three senior US officials on the issue. Obama involved Eikenberry in the White House discussions as he sought to establish how long it would take to see results in Afghanistan and to be able to withdraw forces. &quot;He wants to know where the off-ramps are&quot;, one official was quoted as saying. Administration officials said Obama had repeatedly asked whether a large American force might undermine the objective of training Afghan security forces and persuading them to fight on their own. A statement issued by the White House after the latest meeting appeared to reflect Eikenberry&apos;s concerns, the Washington Post suggested. &quot;The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time.&quot; But none of the scenarios contemplated at yesterday&apos;s meeting called for the scaling back of the US presence or delaying the sending of extra troops. The Wall Street Journal said a potential compromise is to deploy 30,000-35,000 extra US troops, of which about 10,000 would be trainers for the Afghan army, in the hope of speeding up the transfer of responsibility from international forces to the Afghans. The New York Times reported that this option had gained the support of the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the defence secretary, Robert Gates. Obama has been accused by Republicans of dithering and this was the eighth meeting of the war cabinet. But the White House has responded that he wants to get it right, and contrasts his patient approach with the rush to war under his predecessor, George Bush. Obama is scheduled to arrive in Japan tomorrow at the start of a nine-day tour of east Asia, including visits to Singapore, South Korea and Japan. It is unlikely he will make the announcement while abroad, as the White House said he wants to explain his decision to the US public. Obama returns to the US on 19 November and could make the announcement the following day. If he delays, the week after sees the Thanksgiving holiday, and that could see the announcement delayed until the first week in December. Officials said that while a troop increase has been agreed in principle, the exact figure is still to be resolved. The discussions were not about a new strategy for Afghanistan but about how to implement the one announced in the spring, they said. The strategy announced in spring set out the prime US aims to disrupt al-Qaida and the Taliban, and that nation-building was secondary to that. As well as US lack of confidence in Karzai, there is disappointment that European forces have been reluctant to send reinforcements. As a secondary position, Washington has been asking allies unable to send forces to at least provide financial help."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/12/obama-japan-china-visit", "sentences": ["Obama&apos;s nine-day, four-country tour will also see him putting the case for the release of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to Burma&apos;s prime minister, Thein Sein, and other south-east Asian leaders in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T12:36:11Z", "title": "Allegiancy worries as Obama heads to Japan on east Asia visit", "tags": ["Obama administration", "Japan", "US news", "China", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "article": "The message from the White House is upbeat: the US is a Pacific nation determined to strengthen its ties with Asia. But Barack Obama will face tough challenges over the economy, trade and Japan&apos;s alliance with Washington from the moment he arrives in Tokyo tomorrow at the start of his first presidential visit to the region. Until recently, the US could depend on Japan \u2013 its closest Asian ally for 50 years \u2013 to smooth its path into trickier diplomatic territory nearby. But the recent election of a centre-left government in Tokyo intent on ending Japan&apos;s subservience to Washington is threatening to weaken what a former US ambassador to the country described as the most important bilateral partnership in the world. South Korea, another old ally, will push hard for progress on a stalled trade agreement, though administration officials have played down hope of a breakthrough. Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their most amicable for years. But some observers question whether closer ties will bring measurable results, and the friendship is not without its problems: today it emerged that Obama may ditch his sole meeting with the Chinese public unless Washington and Beijing can resolve disagreements over its format. In an interview with Reuters this week, Obama described China as a &quot;vital partner&quot;, but warned of &quot;enormous strains&quot; if economic imbalances between the country and the US were not corrected. Trade tensions have already been felt, with China attacking US tariffs on its tyres and steel pipes. But Beijing hinted today that it might allow appreciation of the yuan. American manufacturers complain the Chinese currency is kept artificially low. Obama&apos;s nine-day, four-country tour will also see him putting the case for the release of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to Burma&apos;s prime minister, Thein Sein, and other south-east Asian leaders in Singapore. But Obama&apos;s priority will be addressing the rift with Tokyo \u2013 caused by a 2006 agreement to reduce the American presence on the southern island of Okinawa, home to more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan. The US is keen to push ahead with the deal \u2013 12 years in the making \u2013 which would see the Futenma military base relocated from the crowded city of Ginowan to a remote site off the east coast. The move would also presage the transfer of 8,000 marines to the US Pacific territory of Guam. Japan&apos;s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, took office promising to review the agreement. His apparent preference is for the base to be moved out of Okinawa altogether, possibly to a location overseas. &quot;There are many issues that President Obama is concerned about and issues that Japan is concerned about, so we would like to discuss each theme,&quot; he told the Japanese parliament. &quot;I am convinced it will be a meaningful trip.&quot; Obama says he expects Japan to abide by the $10bn (\u00a36bn) agreement to relocate Futenma to a new offshore location. &quot;It is perfectly appropriate for the new government to want to re-examine how to move forward,&quot; he said in an interview with Japanese broadcaster NHK. &quot;I am confident that once that review is completed that they will conclude that the alliance we have, the basing arrangements that have been discussed, all those things serve the interests of Japan and they will continue.&quot; Hatoyama&apos;s unenviable task will be to reconcile Washington&apos;s demands with opposition to the US presence on Okinawa. At the weekend more than 20,000 people protested against the US presence, a show of force that coincided with the arrest of an American soldier accused of killing a Japanese man in a hit-and-run incident. Attempts have begun to get the leaders&apos; meeting off to an auspicious start, with Japan&apos;s pledge on Tuesday of 5bn yen in aid for Afghanistan over five years. The announcement was designed to assuage US concerns that Japan&apos;s commitment to the &quot;war on terror&quot; is wavering following its decision not to renew its refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of the US and allied forces in Afghanistan. The global economy and North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme will be a priority throughout Obama&apos;s tour, as will climate change, with the Copenhagen summit just weeks away. His hosts will also want to explore China&apos;s growing influence in the region. With the country forecast to overtake Japan as Asia&apos;s biggest economy next year, concerns persist in Tokyo about the prospect of closer ties between Washington and Beijing. &quot;That idea sends shivers down Japanese spines,&quot; said Richard Samuels, a Japan security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Obama&apos;s overarching message will be that &quot;the US is here to stay in Asia&quot;, Jeffrey Bader, the president&apos;s top Asia adviser, said last week, vowing that &quot;the US will be a player and participant on the ground floor, not a distant spectator&quot;. In China, North Korea&apos;s nuclear programme, and that of Iran, will be high on the agenda, as will Afghanistan and Pakistan. But no major announcements are expected and the White House effectively dismissed the prospect of a climate change agreement between the world&apos;s two largest carbon emitters. US officials have said Obama will also raise human rights. In his meeting this Sunday with the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations, Obama will press for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and more than 2,000 other political prisoners in Burma. His new policy of engagement with the Burmese junta is already paying dividends. Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asia, recently met Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon, while this week a senior Burmese diplomat suggested she could soon be released to play a role in elections planned for next year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/12/fia-flavio-briatore-ban-f1", "sentences": ["Briatore resigned from his job after it was revealed that the Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr was pressured into deliberately crashing out of the 2008 Singapore grand prix, a move which gave an advantage to his team-mate Fernando Alonso, who went on to win the race."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T19:23:17Z", "title": "FIA stands by its decision over Flavio Briatore's lifetime ban", "tags": ["Formula One", "Flavio Briatore", "Renault", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Motor racing&apos;s international governing body has robustly defended its handling of the World Motor Sport Council meeting which led to Flavio Briatore, the former Renault Formula One team principal, being handed a lifetime ban from involvement in any FIA-sanctioned competition.

The new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, has vowed to make Japan less dependent on the US, but the two men agreed to put off the issue of resolving the future of US forces in Japan. However, police in China are reported to have detained dozens of dissidents in a crackdown ahead of Obama&apos;s arrival there today. Human rights campaigners said that at least 30 activists who were expected to apply for the right to hold protests directed at the Chinese government during the US president&apos;s visit were arrested. Reformers worry that Obama will play down China&apos;s poor human rights record in order to maintain good relations on issues such as the economy. &quot;We get the impression Obama doesn&apos;t want to talk about human rights on this trip, but it is precisely because of his visit here that these people are being rounded up and detained right now,&quot; Ai Weiwei, a Beijing-based artist and social commentator, told the Financial Times. Speaking yesterday during the first stop on his nine-day Asian tour, Obama told an audience of 1,500 in the Japanese capital: &quot;I want every American to know that we have a stake in the future of this region, because what happens here has a direct effect on our lives at home.&quot; American officials have portrayed the trip as an opportunity to develop relationships and make progress on non-proliferation, climate change and the economy, and are playing down expectations of any agreements. As in his previous foreign affairs speeches, Obama emphasised his personal ties in the region \u2013 referring to his birth in Hawaii, time in Indonesia and boyhood travels in Asia \u2013 and the administration&apos;s break with unilateralism. &quot;We welcome China&apos;s efforts to play a greater role on the world stage \u2013 a role in which their growing economy is joined by growing responsibility,&quot; he said. &quot;Power does not need to be a zero-sum game and nations need not fear the success of another.&quot; He held out a hand to North Korea again, calling for it to denuclearise; and to Burma, if it undertakes democratic reform and frees political prisoners, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma&apos;s prime minister will be present at the president&apos;s meeting with Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) leaders in Singapore. Obama also announced that the US will sign up to a trans-Pacific free trade agreement. That may help to deflect accusations of protectionism, which are likely to be aired throughout his tour. He stressed the need for &quot;balanced&quot; growth and said Asian countries should not be dependent on exports to the US. The economic crisis has underlined the interdependence of &quot;Chimerica&quot; in particular and the trade imbalance that has left China with vast US dollar holdings. Washington wants the Chinese currency, the yuan, to appreciate further; Beijing will repeat its concerns that US debt could endanger its dollar holdings. But Obama&apos;s Chinese visit is about more than money. The world&apos;s two largest carbon emitters are meeting just weeks away from the Copenhagen climate-change conference. China&apos;s influence on North Korea and Iran are central to Obama&apos;s non-proliferation agenda. Its handling of Afghanistan and Pakistan will also be high up in discussions. Obama&apos;s China policy is essentially his predecessor&apos;s; the relationship is increasingly amicable. But some fear attempts to broaden it could mean less meaningful engagement. &quot;Bush&apos;s approach was: you are rising in the international system and need to take on more responsibility,&quot; said Victor Cha, director of Asian affairs in the National Security Council under George Bush and now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;Obama is heaping on all these very, very high expectations \u2013 on issues like climate change and currency \u2013 and I think they are expectations that China cannot possibly meet.&quot; China sees itself as a vulnerable developing country as well as a rising power. And shared anxieties \u2013 such as those over proliferation \u2013 do not equal identical interests. &quot;China&apos;s own interests in those hot spots [North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan] make it deeply conflicted about playing a larger role on the world stage,&quot; said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt\u00a0of the International Crisis Group. &quot;While the United States frames China in terms of its growing responsibilities as a major power, China continues to think primarily in terms of its own interests.&quot; To some observers, the administration is also too keen to please Beijing, wasting leverage rather than smoothing the path to greater gains. Obama&apos;s decision not to meet the Dalai Lama last month \u2013 aides say he will do so in future \u2013 &quot;doesn&apos;t send a signal that the US wants to work with China; it sends a signal they have basically got us,&quot; said Cha."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/15/obama-aung-san-suu-kyi-release-burma", "sentences": ["He made the demand during a summit in Singapore with Thein Sein and nine other leaders of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean)."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-15T10:32:00Z", "title": "Free Aung San Suu Kyi, Obama tells Burma PM", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "Barack Obama", "US news", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Thein Sein", "Myanmar"], "article": "Barack Obama today urged Burma to release the democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a landmark meeting with the country&apos;s prime minister. He made the demand during a summit in Singapore with Thein Sein and nine other leaders of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean). The meeting made Obama the first US president to be present in the same room as a Burmese leader since Lyndon Johnson met Prime Minister Ne Win in 1966. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters that Obama had raised the subject of Aung San Suu Kyi &quot;directly with that government&quot;, indicating that he had spoken directly to Thein Sein. There were conflicting reports whether the US president had shaken hands with the Burmese premier. After the meeting, Obama told reporters that he had &quot;reaffirmed&quot; an offer made earlier of better relations with Washington if Burma pursued democratic reforms and freed political prisoners. Speaking in Tokyo yesterday, Obama made a point of mentioning Aung San Suu Kyi by name, adding that Burma would only find &quot;true security and prosperity&quot; by releasing her and more than 2,000 other political prisoners. He acknowledged that years of US sanctions against Burma, coupled with engagement by its Asian neighbours, had failed to bring about change. &quot;Despite years of good intentions, neither sanctions by the US nor engagement of others have succeeded in improving the lives of Burmese people,&quot; he said. &quot;So we are now communicating directly with the leadership to make it clear that existing sanctions will remain until there are concrete steps toward democratic reform. &quot;There are clear steps that must be taken.&quot; Following today&apos;s meeting, the Asean leaders said they hoped the US&apos;s new policy of engagement with Burma would &quot;contribute to broad political and economic reforms&quot; and said next year&apos;s Burmese elections &quot;must be conducted in a free, fair, inclusive and transparent manner in order to be credible to the international community&quot;. But the statement made no mention of Aung San Suu Kyi and did not call for the release of political prisoners. Afterwards, Thein Sein expressed his appreciation that Washington had decided to re-engage with Burma. &quot;It will be a new chapter in the relationship to all the countries in the region,&quot; the Asean secretary general, Surin Pitsuwan, quoted him as saying. The meeting was the first between a US president and the leaders of Asean, which was formed more than 40 years ago at the height of the Vietnam war. Obama attended the meeting as part of a nine-day visit to Asia that began in Japan on Friday. The US and Asean have arrived at a rare consensus on the need to engage Burma to bring about political reforms and improvements in human rights. Obama recently launched a new policy of engagement with the country&apos;s military junta, while insisting sanctions would stay in place until there were signs of real progress. Aung San Suu Kyi is serving 18 months in detention after a Burmese court found her guilty of allowing an uninvited American guest to stay at her home in violation of the terms of her house arrest. Critics of the dictatorship denounced the trial and verdict as an attempt to exclude her from elections due to be held next year. Her opposition National League for Democracy won elections in 1990 but the result was never recognised by the junta, which has ruled Burma since 1962. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent 14 of the last 20 years in detention, has said she supports the White House&apos;s fresh approach, and earlier this month met Kurt Campbell, Obama&apos;s top diplomat for east Asia, in a rare trip outside her dilapidated mansion in the capital, Rangoon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/15/tiger-woods-australian-masters", "sentences": ["If I play like I did this week, I think I stand a good chance.&quot; Liang only emerged as a serious contender with second place in Singapore earlier this month but, needing to claim second in Hong Kong, could only finish alongside Jaidee, nine shots adrift of winner Gregory Bourdy."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-15T11:56:41Z", "title": "Tiger Woods triumphs in Australian Masters", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Victoria&apos;s hefty investment in Tiger Woods secured a healthy return at the Australian Masters, which the world No1 won at Kingston Heath today. The event was a sellout throughout, with 25,000 crowding the course each day of the tournament. Woods, the joint leader after 54 holes with the Australians Greg Chalmers and James Nitties, scored a final-round 68 on the par-72 Melbourne course to win by two strokes over Chalmers (70) in sole second. Fran\u00e7ois Delamontagne of France shot 69 for a share of third on 10 under with Jason Dufner (70) of the US, and Nitties (73) rounded out the top five on nine under. Woods opened yesterday&apos;s round with a birdie, signalling that Saturday&apos;s misadventures, when he had a frustrating 72, were over. In fine, warm conditions, the 14-time major winner made his move with successive birdies at the 5th and 6th. First he hit a long iron for a tap-in at the 384-yard 5th for the outright lead, followed by a pitching wedge to inches at the next for a simple putt to extend it. Woods&apos;s most telling shot of the day was at the par-five 12th, where he hammered a fairway wood from 293 yards to within five yards of the flag, setting up another birdie for a three-shot lead. A furious Woods blamed an over-enthusiastic photographer for the wayward approach which was to cost him a shot at 13 \u2013 his one blemish for the round \u2013 and a par at the 14th was an opportunity lost. However, w When he birdied the 155-yard 15th, his challengers were effectively out of the contest. The champion was kept alert by Chalmers, who managed a couple of early birdies and remained thereabouts despite a dropped shot at the 173-metre 8th. What really hurt the 36-year-old, however, was his failure to convert two gilt-edged birdie opportunities when he most needed to on the back nine, at the 14th and 16th. Woods&apos;s victory was warmly welcomed by the Victorian premier, John Brumby, whose state government attracted criticism for agreeing to underwrite Woods&apos;s appearance fee of US$3m, which was double the prize pool for the event. Adam Bland&apos;s 67 was the best of the day while two former Australian Masters champions Craig Spence, the 1999 winner, and Aaron Baddeley (2007), both matched Woods&apos;s 68. The defending champion Rod Pampling fired a final-round 73 to finish level-14th at four-under overall. Thailand&apos;s Thongchai Jaidee won an unprecedented third Asian Tour Order of Merit title after finishing in 11th place in Hong Kong. Jaidee, who was also Asia&apos;s No1 in 2001 and 2004, carded a final round of 67, three under par, to ensure top spot ahead of China&apos;s Liang Wen-chong with two events remaining.

While this falls short of hopes that Copenhagen would lock in place a new action plan for the world, it recognises the lack of progress in recent preparatory talks and the hold-ups of climate legislation in the US Senate. &quot;There was a realistic assessment \u2026 by the leaders that it was unrealistic to expect a full internationally legally binding agreement to be negotiated between now and when Copenhagen starts in 22 days,&quot; said Michael Froman, deputy national security adviser for economic affairs. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the host and chairman of the climate talks, flew overnight to Singapore to pitch the deferral plan to 19 leaders, including Obama and Chinese president Hu Jintao, at an unscheduled event during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. He insisted that the Copenhagen talks could still set political targets and outline commitments. &quot;Given the time factor and the situation of individual countries we must, in the coming weeks, focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible,&quot; he said. &quot;The Copenhagen agreement should finally mandate continued legal negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion.&quot; Obama was said to have spoken in support of the proposal, cautioning the group not to let the &quot;perfect be the enemy of the good&quot;, Froman said. The proposal by Denmark, the host and chair of the climate talks, would set the stage for a political accord at Copenhagen next month and the setting of a new deadline for countries to agree on targets, levels of funding and verification of commitments. This would give breathing space for the US Senate to pass carbon-capping legislation, allowing the Obama administration to bring a 2020 target and financing pledges to the table at a UN climate meeting in Mexico or Germany in mid-2010. It was unclear if China, the world&apos;s biggest emitter, supported the delay, but other leaders said there was little choice. &quot;Leaders \u2026 were clear in their view that the current officials-led process is running into all sorts of difficulties, and therefore it is time for leaders, politically, to step in,&quot; the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, told reporters after the meeting with Rasmussen. &quot;It&apos;s going to be tough as all hell, but let me tell you I believe everyone is seeking, right now, to put their best foot forward, and that was reflected in what transpired around a small table of 20 world leaders this morning.&quot; The extension of the process is not unexpected, given the flurry of downbeat statements by world leaders in recent weeks. It may avoid a total breakdown at Copenhagen, but the delay has frustrated those who feel time is running out to prevent calamitous levels of climate change. &quot;Heads of states must go beyond simply discussing the problems. They have to start solving them,&quot; said Diane McFadzien of the Worldwide Fund for Nature.

But Malaysia considers itself an exception. Its leaders just gave race-based policies a renewed stamp of approval. Last month, prime minister Najib Razak vowed to continue an unpopular affirmative action policy that favours the nation&apos;s Malays (who make up for slightly more than half of its population) over the Chinese and Indian minorities, who account for about 26% and 8% respectively. The New Economic Policy (NEP), as this racialised national programme is known, was introduced nearly four decades back to raise the Malays&apos; share of the nation&apos;s wealth from a meagre 1.5% to a more equitable 30% and create a Malay middle class. To this end, the government imposed racial quotas in such spheres as education and business. The quotas resulted in civil service scholarships being granted to Malays over more deserving minority candidates, and the same could be said of government jobs. Meanwhile, businesses must meet a minimum level of 30% ownership for Malays and other indigenous people. While Malaysia&apos;s Chinese and Indian minorities were at first agreeable, the prolonged implementation of NEP-type policies has today left them feeling like second-class citizens. Many, especially the affluent Chinese, left Malaysia to seek opportunities elsewhere. The largely working-class Indians were not as fortunate. Ironically, a sizable segment of the Malay population \u2013 from the middle and working classes \u2013 also began complaining about these policies on the grounds that they benefited only a select group of well-connected Malays. Such discontent has led to Malaysians registering their protest during last year&apos;s general election by voting overwhelmingly for the opposition instead of the ruling coalition that comprises a hotchpotch of race-based parties headed by Najib&apos;s United Malays National Organisation (Umno). Although the latter still won the polls, it took a severe hammering \u2013 losing its two-thirds parliamentary majority and the control of five states. Little wonder that Umno which fashions itself as a party championing Malay rights since its inception in 1946 has now decided to tone down its racial policies through a slew of reforms this year. Among others, it launched the &quot;1Malaysia&quot; concept to unite the nation&apos;s racially-fractured citizens. Najib also announced that a merit-based scholarship open to all races will be introduced next year. While many analysts are quick to proclaim that Umno is now a transformed political entity, evidence that it has moved past racialism is sparse. For one thing, the tenets of &quot;1Malaysia&quot; are still nebulous at this juncture. Yet the most telling sign could be gleaned from the rhetoric of its up-and-coming politician Khairy Jamaluddin who wants the party to discard its ideology of &quot;Malay dominance&quot; for &quot;Malay leadership&quot;. Herein lies the crux of the problem. The pith of the &quot;Malay leadership&quot; ideal is no different from &quot;Malay dominance&quot; \u2013 Malays are to reign supreme over other races. In its basest form, &quot;Malay leadership&quot; resonates of the &quot;Hutu Power&quot; ideology in Rwanda and the white supremacist slant of South Africa&apos;s apartheid where one race dominates over others. Instead of eradicating Malaysia&apos;s decades-long racialism, its ruling elites look set to entrench it further into the system by making it subtle. However, driving racialism underground has its social costs. To understand this, Malaysia needs to look no further than neighbouring Singapore where racialism is understatedly exercised in the way the city-state maps educational performances and social ills by race. Doing so has put its minority Malays, largely from the lower income groups, in an unfavourable light. Official statistics show that this group which makes up about 14% of Singapore&apos;s largely Chinese population are overly represented in terms of social problems such as teenage pregnancies and divorces. This has the entrenched stereotypes that the Malays are a problematic lot \u2013 oversexed and irresponsible. So much so that some have hinted of racism. One journalist, for instance, likens being a Malay Singaporean to feeling &quot;like the least favourite child in the family&quot;. The Singapore example suggests that subtle racialism gives rise to a population trapped in a worldview that hails race as their primary identity marker. But Malaysia is probably in a worse quagmire. Two years back its capital, Kuala Lumpur, was the scene of a racial protest by lower-class Indians that saw the police clamping down on demonstrators. If Umno leaders are serious about reforms, then they must seriously consider eradicating racialism in all its manifestations. An alternative proposal mooted by Malaysia&apos;s opposition calls for a needs-based affirmative action policy which dishes out aid by income group to replace the government&apos;s pro-Malay stance. Still, the real litmus test of Umno&apos;s commitment to inclusivity is a controversial one: disband race-based parties altogether. This would mean outlawing Umno and their partners, supplanting in their place a political entity that is colour-blind. Perhaps only then could Malaysia truly claim itself to be one."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/nov/18/peter-foote-obituary", "sentences": ["He returned from Singapore to Plymouth as navigator of\u00a0his ship at the age of 22."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-18T19:05:40Z", "title": "Peter Foote obituary", "tags": ["UCL (University College London)", "Iceland", "Norway", "Europe"], "article": "Peter Foote, who has died at the age of 85, was the UK&apos;s leading authority on medieval Scandinavian and Icelandic literature. From 1950 until his early retirement in 1983, he dominated the field from his position as lecturer and then professor at University College London (UCL), in the department of Scandinavian studies that he had founded more or less singlehandedly. Retirement merely liberated him into leadership of the wider academic community. His writings and lectures ranged widely over the Icelandic sagas and their historical and literary contexts, the early Icelandic laws and the culture of medieval Scandinavia. They were distinguished by a combi-nation of deep learning with a wit and humanity that engaged students and his academic peers alike. Peter was born in Swanage, Dorset, the fourth of five sons of a butcher. While the older boys left school at 14, he\u00a0attended the recently founded grammar school, emerging as house captain and head boy. He went on a\u00a0scholarship to the University College of the South West of England (later the University of Exeter). In 1943 his studies were interrupted by service in the Royal Navy, much of it in the far east. There he met Eleanor McCaig, a nurse, whom he was to marry in 1951. He returned from Singapore to Plymouth as navigator of\u00a0his ship at the age of 22. In later years he was to reminisce about navigating by the stars, not unlike the Vikings whose sagas he studied. Finishing his BA in English in 1948 with first-class honours, Peter was funded by a Norwegian government scholarship for a year in Oslo. He was inspired by the distinguished professor of northern philology Anne Holtsmark, speaking highly not only of her attainments but of her generosity with her time, a characteristic that became the hallmark of his own encouragement of the work of students and junior colleagues. He would also urge those who aspired to have careers in the Old Norse field \u2013 sometimes in defiance of the claims of family and work commitments \u2013 to spend a year or more&apos;s apprenticeship in a Scandinavian country. In 1951 he achieved an MA in English at UCL, having already been appointed assistant lecturer in Old Icelandic. At the time, the teaching of this subject was subsumed within the department of English, as it remains to this day in most British universities in which the subject survives. Over the course of his career, which was based entirely at UCL, Peter gave the subject a new emphasis, and arguably a new solidity, by overseeing the development of a full-blown department of Scandinavian studies in which the modern Scandinavian languages \u2013 including, by 1968, Faroese \u2013 are taught alongside Scandinavian history, together with medieval studies and philology. His charismatic leadership skills and ability to charm both university bureaucrats and potential funders should not obscure the scope of his scholarly vision. In 1964 he prefaced his inaugural lecture as professor of\u00a0Old Scandinavian, on the Saga of\u00a0the Faroe Islanders, a text he made particularly his own, with an indication of his understanding of the term &quot;Old Scandinavian, the subject I profess. It\u00a0might indeed be argued that by itself it means nothing that ever was, but ... it confers a welcome freedom, so\u00a0that I may with perfect propriety offer a\u00a0lecture on an Icelandic text concerning Atlantic islanders of Norwegian origin whose descendants have now for some centuries technically owed allegiance to the Danish crown.&quot; He claimed to have chosen his specialism because the\u00a0Old\u00a0Icelandic corpus was small enough to be mastered within a\u00a0single lifetime. While he fulfilled that ambition amply, he went much further in his knowledge of the sources and analogues, particularly in Latin, that lay behind the distinctiveness of the Norse material. His publications reveal the import-ance, for Peter, of close engagement with primary texts. Their subjects range from the exploits of the Viking-age heroes of Iceland (with an edition of Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu in 1957 and a comprehensive essay on G\u00edsla saga) to the technical intricacies of the early Icelandic legal code Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s, which he translated in collaboration with other scholars. Together with David Wilson, in 1970, he wrote The Viking Achievement. His most substantial contributions came after his retirement: the edited translation in three volumes, 1996-98, of the 16th-century Latin Description of the Northern Peoples by Olaus Magnus, an enormously influential work of early historiography that had never before appeared in English; and, most significantly, his editions of J\u00f3ns saga helga, the life of the 12th-century first Bishop of H\u00f3lar (Iceland&apos;s northern ecclesiastical see). Two volumes of his collected articles \u2013 ranging from the trivial to the seminal \u2013 were published as festschrifts for his 60th and 80th birthdays. Peter took his vision to the wider academic community through his involvement with the Viking Society for Northern Research, of which he was honorary secretary for many years and twice president. He was recognised throughout Scandinavia as an outstandingly distinguished scholar, receiving honorary degrees from the universities of Uppsala and Iceland. He had a special love for Iceland; its ferociously smoked meat and fiery brenniv\u00edn (schnapps), but more especially the many friends, scholars and others, who marvelled at his flexible command of, and ability to make jokes in, their language. Despite his far-flung interests and worldwide reputation, Peter remained true to his Dorset roots. He walked for relaxation, preferably by the sea, but also from his house in Highgate, north London, to work in Bloomsbury. He was a keen bell-ringer, an art he had learned as a teenager in Swanage. He\u00a0once told me he found conversation difficult, a shyness he masked under a characteristically provocative and playful style. In the academic arena, he had a fearsome reputation for puncturing pretension and asking the unerringly awkward question. He could devastate those he considered guilty of\u00a0indulging in fashionable theory or wilful obscurity, at the expense of a searching engagement with the essential text. Our informal London reading group, which he attended up to his last year, acquired its name Or\u00f0henglar (&quot;Pedants&quot;) from his militant defence of the integrity of the Icelandic language. His passion for his subject was conveyed with grace and wit, which he loved to share over a convivial meal. Eleanor died in 2006. Peter is survived by two daughters and a son. \u2022 Peter Godfrey Foote, scholar of Old Norse-Icelandic studies, born 26 May 1924; died 29 September 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/nov/21/talking-horses-will-hayler", "sentences": ["He obviously won&apos;t be at 100% fitness for his first start since a narrow defeat in Singapore back in May, but his wellbeing has been obvious on the gallops in the last couple of weeks and he should still go very close to winning here."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-21T10:00:00Z", "title": "Talking Horses", "tags": ["Sport", "Horse racing", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "Racing live - the latest news from around the tracks 4pm Star refuses to be dimmed Will Hayler reports: Kauto Star gained the hardest fought of his 12 Grade One wins when scrambling home by a nose in the Betfair Chase at Haydock. When the dual Gold Cup winner took the advantage from Imperial Commander at the second-last fence, it seemed simply a question of how far he would win by. But silencing doubts over his stamina for this three-mile trip in soft ground, Imperial Commander refused to lie down and rallied on the run-in to force a photo finish in which Betfair punters made him the 1-3 favourite. However, after a short deliberation the judge ruled that Kauto Star had held on by a nose and celebrations followed around a winner&apos;s enclosure which was loudly biased in favour of a horse who has become something of a totem in British jumps racing. &quot;We did want to win today but it is a bigger picture and I have learned that you can&apos;t have them at their best for their first run of the season \u2014 you need to leave enough improvement,&quot; said trainer Paul Nicholls. &quot;We can just fine tune him now for the King George and then go to Cheltenham so I am absolutely delighted.&quot;  Sponsors William Hill make him a 10-11 chance for his bid to win the King George for a record fourth consecutive time. Of the runner-up, Nigel Twiston-Davies said: &quot;All of the experts said that he couldn&apos;t stay, but why couldn&apos;t he? He powered up the hill to win the Paddy Power in soft ground \u2013 of course he was going to stay. In fact, if today&apos;s race had been at three and a quarter miles, he&apos;d have won.

The winner only got back up in the dying strides having been overtaken after the last flight by Starluck, who was travelling very easily and looking all over the winner. Winning trainer David Pipe said: &quot;I didn&apos;t think there was as much between our horse and Starluck as the ratings suggested and that has proved it. We only dropped him back in trip with the ground being soft and I imagine he&apos;ll go back up in trip next time as all he does is gallop. He&apos;ll make a good chaser in time but there will be a few more hurdle races on the way.&quot;  Alan Fleming said of the runner-up: &quot;He looked like the winner but the ground got to him. Timmy said he winged the last and he will probably hold on to him longer next time. Livelier ground is the key to him and he should get that at Kempton over Christmas.&quot;  12.50pm Will Hayler reports from Haydock: The skies may be ominously grey, but the rain is still largely holding off at Haydock this afternoon and Kauto Star has consequently proved popular in the betting for today&apos;s Betfair Chase.  Even the last of the even-money has now dried up and he currently trades at 1.91 with the sponsors. Paul Nicholls walked the course before the first race and said he was &quot;surprisingly pleased&quot; by conditions. He was even more pleased after the race when Pepe Simo ran out an easy winner from Any Given Day. That horse heads to the Tolworth Hurdle now and Totesport&apos;s stand-out 33-1 for the Supreme Novice Hurdle doesn&apos;t look a bad price about a horse who is evidently held in some regard. Other jockeys also disagreed with the official assessment of &apos;Soft, heavy in places&apos;. Jason Maguire said: &quot;I struggled to find the heavy places. It&apos;s not bad at all.&quot; Will Hayler&apos;s guide to all today&apos;s TV races Ruby Walsh can engineer a third Betfair Chase victory for the brilliant Kauto Star (2.55) at Haydock Park this afternoon. The dual Gold Cup winner is a dependable performer, having won two-thirds of the 21 races he has contested (14 of which have been Grade Ones) since joining Paul Nicholls in 2004. If the heavens have opened overnight as the worst of the forecasts suggests might happen then mud-loving Notre Pere will undoubtedly be in his element. But Walsh will not be setting off at a searing gallop which would play into his rivals&apos; hands in such conditions and knows all about how to get the better of Notre Pere, having partnered Neptune Collonges to beat him in the Hennessy at Leopardstown on soft ground back in February. Ascot 2.05 Cornas would have gone close in last season&apos;s Arkle Chase but for slipping on landing at the tricky second-last fence. He was back to form when possibly just outstayed by Planet of Sound at Exeter afterwards and this drop back in trip and flatter track should suit. Haydock 2.20 Naiad du Misselot did not do much over fences last season, but could find these brush hurdles much more to his liking. He is just 4lb higher in the weights than when taking the Coral Cup in 2008. Ascot 2.35 Zaynar moves up in trip, which will help his cause, and although it can often be a struggle for four-year-olds against older rivals, Nicky Henderson&apos;s runner has the potential to offer plenty more this season. Ascot 3.10 Voy Por Ustedes is a class act but may well need the race on his first start of the season. Planet of Sound is progressive and should go well, but he might struggle off level weights against the classy and race-fit Schindlers Hunt. The selection went close in the Ryanair Chase and then was only narrowly beaten by Vor Por Ustedes at Aintree and is 4lb better off here. Haydock 3.25 Shining Gale got going too late on his latest start, but these conditions will suit him better and he is expected to go on to good things this season. Lingfield 3.40 Presvis would be a good thing on his best form \u2013 even having to give weight away \u2013 if his fitness could be guaranteed. But the horse&apos;s next engagement in Hong Kong is fast approaching and Luca Cumani surely will not have him too far shy of his peak here. Horse sense Pause And Clause (2.20) was having just the fourth run of his life over hurdles when an excellent third in the Coral Cup at last season&apos;s Cheltenham Festival. His subsequent flop at Aintree can easily be forgiven and connections are very hopeful of a big run as he returns to action at Haydock this afternoon. This is a competitive contest and much will of course depend upon how he takes to jumping the fixed brush hurdles, but he still has plenty of scope for improvement at this stage of his career and connections believe that he is ready to do himself justice at the first time of asking this season. Charlie Mann&apos;s Wendel is worth a small saver in the same contest. Planet of Sound (3.10) showed his usual gutsy attitude when taking the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter at the start of the month and is reckoned to have improved for that run. He faces a stiff task against proven high-quality rivals at Ascot today, most notably the excellent Voy Por Ustedes, but he is going the right way with every run and has race fitness on his side. In the bumper, there is a positive word to be passed on for the Paul Webber-trained Scampi Boy (3.45), who was no cheap purchase at \u00a470,000 last year. He is held in some regard and may be up to making a winning debut, even in this exciting line-up. The Luca Cumani-trained Presvis (3.40), who runs at Lingfield, is the obvious class act on the three all-weather cards today. With a penalty for his Group One win at Sha Tin, he has to give stacks of weight away to his rivals in the Churchill Stakes, his prep for a trip to Hong Kong next month. He obviously won&apos;t be at 100% fitness for his first start since a narrow defeat in Singapore back in May, but his wellbeing has been obvious on the gallops in the last couple of weeks and he should still go very close to winning here. Mille Chief proved an expensive loser when brought down at Market Rasen on his British debut, but compensation should await if he lines up at Newbury later this week. While high-class staying hurdler Punchestowns has been impressing in his schooling and is ready to make his steeplechasing debut at the same meeting, trainer Nicky Henderson is currently leaning towards the 2\u00bd-mile option on the Friday. Seen and heard Matt Chapman&apos;s occasionally rowdy way with the microphone on At The Races may be something of an acquired taste, but his presenting style is proving increasingly popular with his peers, with Chapman having for the first time reached the shortlist \u2013 alongside Clare Balding, Graham Cunningham and Nick Luck \u2013 for the Sir Peter O&apos;Sullevan Trophy for the Broadcaster of the Year at next month&apos;s Horserace Writers&apos; Derby Awards. Furthermore, rumour has it that Chapman has this week been selected, along with two other applicants, for a trial as a racecourse commentator that will see him attend a handful of meetings early next year and try out his race-calling skills in private before a decision is taken as to whether he will then join the commentators&apos; rota. Richard Griffiths, editor of Thoroughbred Owner &amp; Breeder magazine, is to leave the publication to return to former pastures at the Racing Post. Griffiths is to become bloodstock editor at the Post, replacing Sally Duckett, who had held the position for about a year since the departure of Rachel Pagones. Hamid Karzai&apos;s controversial swearing-in as Afghan president this week saw a carefully chosen collection of international movers and shakers turn out, with Hilary Clinton \u2013 stood in the front row \u2013 among the first to shake Karzai&apos;s hand after the ceremony. If racing fans thought that the next person to offer his hand to Karzai looked slightly familiar, that&apos;s because it was none other than the Aga Khan. Imam of the Shia Ismaili Muslims, the Aga Khan&apos;s development foundation is a non-governmental organisation that seeks to improve living conditions and opportunities for the poor and has worked extensively in Afghanistan in recent years. Will Hayler&apos;s best bet Bergo 12.35 Huntingdon The selection could not have been more impressive on his steeplechasing debut at Kempton. He jumped proficiently and pulled well clear in the closing stages. Moving back up to 2\u00bd miles at Huntingdon today is in his favour (was successful over this trip over hurdles) and he ought to have far too much speed for Barnhill Brownie, who found three miles on the sharp side last time."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/23/mercedes-brawn-nico-rosberg-schumacher", "sentences": ["The 24-year-old has driven for Williams over the past four seasons, with a second place in Singapore in 2008 his best finish to date."], "publicationDate": "2009-11-23T12:06:23Z", "title": "Michael Schumacher will not make F1 return with Mercedes insists Ross Brawn", "tags": ["Formula One", "Michael Schumacher", "Brawn", "Sport", "Motor sport", "Mercedes GP"], "article": "Michael Schumacher&apos;s prospective return to Formula One with the new Mercedes team was merely a media fantasy, according to team principal Ross Brawn. &quot;The issue now haunts the media, I know,&quot; Brawn told German publication Bild, &quot;but there is nothing in it.

Nico Rosberg has more than three years in Formula 1, so I count him to be experienced. &quot;I do not want a novice who must find their way around racetracks, because we have very few opportunities to test drivers now. Performance without much practice is therefore the task.

The shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, says a Conservative government would encourage top science graduates to go into teaching by offering to cover the payments on their student loans. The proposals are part of a plan to raise the status of teaching as a profession, he said today. Graduates with a first class or 2:1 degree in a science, technology or maths subject from a university approved by the Tories will be eligible. Their loans will be paid off for as long as they remain in teaching, potentially saving each graduate up to \u00a340,000 in total. It is thought that around 2,500 people could take part each year. The scheme, based on a US policy advocated by President Obama, would be paid for out of the Training and Development Agency&apos;s (TDA) current budget, Gove said. In a speech to the Sir John Cass Foundation later today, Gove will say: &quot;If, after leaving school, someone decides to do a maths or science degree at a designated university, achieves a 2:1 or first, and decides to go into teaching, the taxpayer will cover their student loan repayments for as long as they remain in teaching [until the loan is fully paid]. If they leave teaching, then they will have to take up repayments. &quot;Although I anticipate that most such people will want to teach at secondary school, we will make this offer open to people whether they wish to be primary or secondary teachers. For too long, we have undervalued primary teaching and we&apos;ve paid for it with millions of children leaving primary school unable to master the basics, and struggling for the rest of their lives. &quot;This is a major financial incentive, amounting to about \u00a340,000 over the lifetime of the loan, and therefore is a significant investment by the taxpayer, but one I think that is justified \u2013 and it can be paid for by savings elsewhere in the TDA budget. There will be no net increase in the bill to taxpayers for teacher training. &quot;&quot;We will have a new generation of specialist maths and science teachers.

While most attention on China&apos;s investment in Africa has focused on its large-scale pursuit of natural resources, experts say a growing number of entrepreneurs are experimenting with production. However, some questioned whether the workshop of the world was ready to outsource much of its industry. &quot;There is not only willingness but strong interest among some in China, and I&apos;ve discussed with the minister of commerce, Chen Deming, that there may be possibilities of moving some of the lower-value manufacturing facilities to sub-Saharan Africa, toys or footwear,&quot; Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, told the Financial Times. He suggested that Chinese knowhow in production and marketing could boost Africa&apos;s declining share of international trade, but admitted infrastructure improvements were needed to attract companies. It is thought the scheme might involve creating industrial parks \u2013 possibly part-funded by the World Bank and China \u2013 so companies could settle in quickly and operate more effectively. The institution sees manufacturing as a missing element in the continent&apos;s development. China is keen that its presence in Africa should be viewed as more than a resources grab. Last month, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, announced a $10bn (\u00a36bn) low-cost loan initiative, tariff reductions and debt relief-initiatives as the latest steps in its developing partnership. Analysts suggested the measures would help drive demand for Chinese exports as well as aiding African states. Trade between China and Africa reached a record high of $106.84bn in 2008, an increase of 45.1% year-on-year, according to Chinese customs figures. China&apos;s direct investment, excluding the financial sector, rose to \u00a3550m in the first half of this year, up 79%, while the country has built huge amounts of infrastructure in recent years. The relationship has also brought friction, with some African leaders arguing that competition from cheap Chinese imports has undercut an already weak manufacturing base, even if consumers have benefited. Campaigners in Africa as well as the west also complain that China does not press its partners on governance and human rights issues, filling the coffers of leaders whom others believe should not be in power. Dr Jing Gu, of Sussex University&apos;s Institute of Development Studies, said intense domestic competition had already led Chinese companies to look further afield for opportunities. &quot;My own research on Chinese private investment has shown that it is increasingly in manufacturing,&quot; she said. &quot;If you consider Ghana&apos;s 340 Chinese investment projects, more than 100 are in manufacturing. In Ethiopia, about 66% of Chinese companies are. &quot;With China&apos;s push for industrial restructuring at home, Chinese companies have [also] been saying there&apos;s an urgent need to move up the value chain. That might leave a space for Africa. &quot;There are already [government] measures aimed at facilitating access to credit and simplifying procedures for Chinese firms looking to invest overseas, especially in Africa.&quot; Professor Shujie Yao, of the China Policy Institute at Nottingham University, pointed out that many Asian economies had made similar transitions from mass-producing cheap goods to outsourcing manufacturing. &quot;Japan moved its manufacturing to South East Asia ... Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea moved theirs to China,&quot; he said. But he added that any substantial shift of manufacturing could be &quot;painfully slow&quot; given Africa&apos;s infrastructure and said China still had an abundance of cheap labour. Provincial governments might well resist a measure that would be likely to cost jobs. Rhys Jenkins, the professor of development economics at the University of East Anglia, said there were already complaints in Africa that Chinese investors brought in their own labour force to work on projects instead of creating jobs for the local population. The ministry of commerce in Beijing could not be reached for comment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/dec/05/laurie-engel-fund-teenage-cancer-trust", "sentences": ["Big cheques came in from Singapore and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-05T00:05:36Z", "title": "Laurie Engel Fund: After the sky\u00a0fell in", "tags": ["Cancer research", "Cancer"], "article": "I have had many pieces of good fortune in my life, and one of them is that I write by a window that has one of the best views in England: the eastern ridge of the Black Mountains, which divides Herefordshire from Wales. My mountain never looks the same twice, changing with the seasons, the weather and the light. As I write now, a layer of mist is moving south, sleet is falling, and the outline is vague, ethereal. Often I think of the ridge, with only slight geographical inaccuracy, as Housman&apos;s Blue Remembered Hills. That is the land of lost content / I see it shining plain / The happy highways where I went / And cannot come again. It is six years now since my son Laurie was his happy, original self, well enough to force me regularly out of window-gazing and into a game of football, and nearly four and a quarter years since the cancer that lurked in his body finally killed him, aged 13. And it is four years ago to the week since Guardian Weekend published my article about Laurie (The day the sky fell in, 3 December 2005), which transformed our early, unfocused fundraising efforts on behalf of Teenage Cancer Trust and made possible next week&apos;s astonishing event: the handing over of a new \u00a32.5m unit for teenage patients in\u00a0Birmingham. There are, to put it mildly, mixed emotions for us: my wife Hilary, my daughter Vika and myself. I think a great deal about the land of lost content, but it doesn&apos;t shine plain any more. The memories of Laurie also grow vague and ethereal. It gets harder to hear his voice and recall his gestures. That&apos;s true of everyone we lose: my grandparents have all been gone for 40 years and more now, and of them only the blurriest mental snapshots remain. Vika was seven when Laurie died and for her, he is already becoming blurry. We have to imagine what Laurie would now be doing: A-levels, we presume; his Ucas form; planning a gap year that I hope would have been more original than going to Machu Picchu to send emails. We are lucky too that I had videoed Laurie&apos;s life fairly obsessively: 50 hours of tape that a friend boiled down to a\u00a0snappy half-hour for his memorial service. But the passage of time does what it does. What it hasn&apos;t done is erode the pain. Every parent knows by instinct that the loss of a child is not to be compared with other forms of grief. But I had no idea how deep the wounds would be or how permanent the scars. I have been able to make use of the cathartic process of writing: I have not felt so creatively energetic in years. I am also good at superficial blitheness. Hilary \u2013 an editor not a writer, a mother not a\u00a0father \u2013 has found it far harder. We cannot know the effect on Vika. She&apos;s now 11: athletic, bubbly, imaginative rather than cerebral. She has just started at the local high school, Fairfield, that Laurie adored and which\u00a0has\u00a0its own memorial to him, Laurie&apos;s Well. And she loves it too. But we know we are not the parents we might have been. Still, we have at least hung in there together. After the Guardian piece appeared and the fund went whoosh, I began to receive emails \u2013 dozens of them \u2013 from people who had lost children but had not had the opportunity to tell their story in a national newspaper. These would often finish with a similar line: &quot;Sadly, the pressure was too great for our relationship, and we have now separated.&quot; Mourning is an individual process, not a communal one, because no two people grieve in synch. Yet parents have to try. And a surprising number of friends and acquaintances have told us something else: that they had lost siblings in their childhood \u2013 cot deaths, cancer, accidents, whatever. The punchline of these stories tends to be different: that their parents \u2013 in those tight-lipped days \u2013 stayed together all right but never referred to the dead child again. And that they themselves were only now, as adults, coming to terms with the dim recollections of their loss. The Engels have not gone in for stony-faced silence. We talk about Laurie constantly, repeat his jokes, and have private rituals, like toasting him whenever we have a special dinner. And the public success of the Laurie Engel Fund has forced us into the open. Heaven knows what we thought we were doing when we started. Birmingham Children&apos;s hospital, where Laurie was treated, had a Teenage Cancer Trust (TCT) unit on its wish list. But it was a long wish list, and there was no obvious means of delivering it, given the constraints of budgeting, and of building on its hemmed-in city centre site. We had stumbled on TCT as a charity in the weeks before Laurie died. And we quickly realised its goals represented the aggregate of his needs during his illness: it builds hospital wards that don&apos;t feel like institutions; places that can offer privacy and self-respect during the bad times, but also the opportunity for fun in the good times; places that friends will visit out of something more than duty; places which recognise that older kids, suffering long-term illness while on the cusp of maturity, have needs that cannot be met in either traditional children&apos;s wards or adult ones. And we also stumbled on a novel relationship. The Laurie Engel Fund would exist solely to raise money for TCT, thus obviating the need to register as a charity with all the attendant bureaucracy. TCT in return would spend the money we raised only for the specific project we wanted \u2013 ie a new unit in Birmingham. But no one had even said there would be such a unit. Luckily again, Paul O&apos;Connor, then the chief executive of the hospital, was among those who read the Guardian article. He knew already how his staff felt about the cramped and ill-designed conditions in the existing ward for cancer patients. Now he grasped that something had to be done sooner rather than later, or sometime never. So we all began to look for a solution. The first meeting concocted a possible scheme, using a couple of rooms belonging to the haematology unit, which would be kicked out into a prefab. The second meeting had an extra participant, someone I could not immediately identify, who sat there looking daggers. That was the haematology consultant. And he wasn&apos;t going anywhere without a fight. Gradually, a more ambitious plan took wing. There might not be an inch of spare ground, but there was just enough spare sky. So it was decided to build up \u2013 putting a steel-clad extension over the ambulance bay, nuzzling up to the operating theatres, and then linking through to the old ward. All this while, the scheme was gaining impetus by sheer force of money. When Laurie died, we talked of raising \u00a310,000; in the Guardian I mentioned \u00a3100,000. We soon left that behind, as readers&apos; donations poured in. More followed, as other papers picked up the story. Then came the local efforts, from our friends in Herefordshire. Then these rippled outwards. By the summer of 2006, an extraordinary range of people were running, cycling, rowing, canoeing, climbing, walking, skydiving, swimming, eating, singing, dancing, playing cricket, playing football \u2026 all to raise money for our fund. Big cheques came in from Singapore and Australia. There was a quiz night on Mallorca. Laurie&apos;s old schoolfriends in Maryland, where we lived for two years, sold homemade lemonade for us. One friend, with a phobia about motorways, raised \u00a3400 by forcing herself to drive four miles down the M54. Our three biggest single sources of funds all came about through extraordinary flukes. An old schoolmate of mine, Simon Silver, was someone I had seen, ooh, at least twice in the previous 35\u00a0years. He is no Guardian reader but glimpsed a copy of the Weekend cover lying round a hotel lounge while on holiday. He says the expression on Laurie&apos;s face was exactly the same as mine aged 13, and he divined at once whose son this boy in the beanie must be \u2013 and also what the story might tell him. Simon is a director of property company Derwent London, which already had connections with TCT. The upshot was a lunch for the fund at the Savoy in November 2006, when Derwent&apos;s business contacts (luckily again) were still feeling flush. It was the most elegant shakedown imaginable. I told the gathering that Simon owed me \u00a3128,000 from a dice game during a Spanish lesson when we were 15, something I\u00a0remember vividly although he \u2013 curiously \u2013 does not. I urged them to give enough money to redeem his reputation. They more than doubled it. Then a complete stranger, a businessman called Nigel Williams, stopped for petrol at our local garage, which was selling copies of the book about Laurie that Hilary had put together. He spotted one by the till, bought it and, a father of teenage boys himself, was captivated. His company, Parkhill Estates, had a woodland site near Peterborough which could not be developed, and donated it. This sold for \u00a3100,000. Finally, there was Otto Putland, a year younger than Laurie and living in another Herefordshire village. Otto read the story in the Hereford Times and was struck by the similarities between the two of them: both sport-mad boys, homebaked themselves, whose parents had then adopted younger girls from overseas at the same time. His sister, Nicky, comes from the Philippines; Vika was born in Siberia. Otto&apos;s sporting achievements outstripped Laurie&apos;s: he is a champion junior swimmer with Olympic aspirations. I think he&apos;s wasted on swimming. He marked his arm with a 6 \u2013 to represent the number of UK teenagers diagnosed with cancer each day \u2013 and, still a 13-year-old himself, went round the swim clubs, challenging and cajoling them. He raised \u00a326,000. Through 2006 and 2007, the fund grew exponentially and the plans moved ahead rapidly. In 2008, the drumbeats from Birmingham grew fainter; there were mutterings about &quot;difficulties&quot;; the\u00a0price tag rose as the technical complexities of the aerial site became clearer. Finally, there was a breakthrough, and word came that the planning application was in and then that it had gone through. Last Christmas, Vika sprained her ankle ice-skating: it&apos;s the sort of thing she does. In January, we had to take her to the orthopaedic consultant at the children&apos;s hospital. The place was now a building site. The other parents were probably rather irritated. Now it is almost ready, and I have seen the nurses peering through the glass from the old ward into the new one, as though gazing on the promised land. At the moment four very sick kids, plus four parents sleeping on camp beds, have to be shoehorned into a room measuring only 6 metres by 5\u00bd. There is double the bed-space in the TCT unit plus the TV-space, pool-table-space, computer-space, gaming-space and schmoozing-space. We have collected about \u00a3890,000. The Maria Watt foundation, run by another bereaved family, has produced \u00a3100,000. The TCT&apos;s regional fundraiser has delivered something like \u00a3500,000. But even my maths cannot get that to add up to \u00a32.5m. So we will keep going. At \u00a3890,000 there are two very tantalising figures on the horizon. And everything we raise will leave TCT&apos;s central funds that much better placed for their next projects: at the Royal Marsden near London, in Southampton, Manchester and Scotland. In any case, we want to hold back some spare cash to ensure that the Birmingham unit does not look sumptuous on day one and NHS-tatty by year three. And I suppose we still need the therapy of doing something, of ensuring that Laurie&apos;s life \u2013 brimming with unfulfilled promise \u2013 makes some kind of sense. The mountain is covered in snow now, the wind is bitter, and I find myself\u00a0thinking of Housman again. Into my heart an air that kills / From yon far country blows: I have nothing that could be described as faith, but I do keep wondering whether there is a far country where Laurie and I might be able to carry on where we left off. Dying does not seem such a big deal if your child has achieved\u00a0it. Our lives here are still punctuated by the dates of Laurie&apos;s crisis: 20 April, when he was diagnosed; 13 June, when we were told \u2013 14 months later \u2013 that the cancer had returned and must be presumed incurable; 22 September, when he died. And coming up, sodding 25 December which, to bereft parents, looms each autumn like a mountain that somehow has to be endured and conquered. But we now have another date too: 4 January.

Abu Dhabi, the affluent desert city and capital of the United Arab Emirates, hit last week&apos;s headlines as its rulers pondered whether to bail out their debt-ridden neighbours in Dubai, but the region is hardly renowned for its liberal attitude to free speech. Censorship still exists in the gulf state. Copies of the Sunday Times&apos;s Asian edition, printed in Singapore, did not appear in Dubai shops last week after the paper&apos;s business section carried a prominent feature on the emirate&apos;s woes, complete with a mocked-up image of its ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, sinking into the Persian Gulf. That hasn&apos;t prevented the paper&apos;s proprietor, News Corp&apos;s chairman Rupert Murdoch, from promising to attend a summit to be held in March in Abu Dhabi, however. Indeed, he is one of the event&apos;s co-chairs. The inaugural Abu Dhabi Media summit, organised by the government-backed Abu Dhabi Media Company, will focus on the emerging markets of the Middle East, India and Asia, many of which are experiencing a huge growth in newspapers sales and an explosion of terrestrial and satellite TV channels. Over 400 delegates are expected to attend. Murdoch says: &quot;I can&apos;t think of a better place to be talking about the future of media. Abu Dhabi sits at a nexus of east and west, of developing and developed, of media present and future.&quot; CNN recently opened an office in Abu Dhabi, attracted by the city&apos;s tax-free status, and the UAE capital is embroiled in a battle with Dubai to attract film and music companies, along with broadcasters. The Abu Dhabi Media Company is also promoting the UAE as a location for film makers. Encouraging the emergence of a creative economy is one thing, however, but advocating an open society is quite another. It is difficult for one to exist without the other and striking a balance between the two has not proved easy.

In a survey of 2,100 employers, recruitment specialist Manpower found that while the UK may not yet be out of recession, there are indications that the overall labour market is starting to pick up again. US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke sounded a similarly cautious tone when he warned yesterday [monday] that there would be no &quot;snapback&quot; in the American economy next year. In a speech to the Economic Club of Washington, Bernanke said that although the outlook had improved the economy still faced some &quot;formidable headwinds&quot; including a weak job market, cautious consumers and still-tight credit. Manpower said the UK labour market was most encouraging in the finance and business services sector as many banks return to profit and prepare to pay out their biggest bonuses ever. However, the outlook was still bleak in both the manufacturing and construction sectors. Mark Cahill, managing director at Manpower UK, said: &quot;The glimmer of hope we saw last quarter is now turning into an encouraging spark. The deeply troubled finance and business services sector of a year ago, which now has the most positive hiring intentions of any industry sector in the UK, is testament to this turnaround in hiring sentiment. While there is still some way to go before the UK makes a full recovery, it is encouraging to see this key sector return to growth.&quot; Confidence in eight of the UK&apos;s 12 regions has improved, with the south-west being the most confident and Wales the least. London employers are reporting positive hiring intentions for the first time in a year as the financial sector recovers. Out of the 71,000 employers surveyed in 35 countries, India had the most positive hiring intentions for the first three months of 2010, closely followed by Brazil and Singapore. Ireland and Greece were bottom. Separately, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that like-for-like retail sales grew 1.8% last month compared to a dire November 2008, when they were down 2.6% as the financial crisis decimated consumer confidence. But the figures mark a retreat from the 3.8% gain seen in October \u2013 the best for the month since 2002 \u2013 amid a further decline in food inflation. Stephen Robertson, the BRC&apos;s director general, said: &quot;We would have expected much stronger growth because the comparison is with very poor results in 2008 when November was the second-worst performing month of the year. Consumer confidence is fragile and has taken a turn for the worse. Uncertainty over jobs and future tax increases and government spending cuts is making customers more cautious. Retailers are hopeful of a better Christmas than last year&apos;s dire performance, but it&apos;s still all to play for.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/09/country-diary-tamar-valley", "sentences": ["Once a valued source of granite for civil engineering, its stone was used in Singapore and Gibraltar as well as for bridges in London, and lighthouses on Guernsey and the Bishop Rock off the Scillies."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-09T00:05:54Z", "title": "Country diary: Tamar Valley", "tags": ["Environment", "Rural affairs", "UK news", "Weather"], "article": "The rising sun briefly transforms the valley&apos;s south-eastern horizon as brilliant colours brighten a wedge of clear sky beyond the far-off silhouette of Dartmoor.

The St George&apos;s distillery in Roudham, Norfolk, will be hoping to do for English whisky what wine producers in the home counties have done for sparkling wine, which has proved more than a match for French champagne. St George&apos;s single malt has already received favourable reviews in its pre-whisky form \u2013 the spirits have to mature for three years before being officially designated whisky. Keir Sword, proprietor of Royal Mile Whiskies, the whisky retailer in Edinburgh, has tasted the peated and non-peated varieties of St George&apos;s and thinks English whisky has what it takes to become a decent tipple. &quot;Both should improve over time and they will be good whiskies,&quot; he said. The English Whisky Company, which owns the St George&apos;s distillery, was started by farmer Andrew Nelstrop and his father James. After deciding on what some might say was a crazy venture in 2005, they distilled the whisky in November 2006. In a publicity coup for the Nelstrops, their distillery was officially opened in March 2007 by Prince Charles. Andrew Nelstrop, managing director, recently took the product to Paris for the Whisky Live show and came back heartened by the response. &quot;This is a spectacular event, again our first ever whisky show,&quot; Nelstrop wrote on his company&apos;s website, &quot;and one that I was very proud to be a part of, although a little scary watching a whisky buff taste whisky older than myself on the neighbouring stand and then head over to our stand to taste 18-month old spirit. &quot;With enormous relief, not one person showed disdain. Given the French are normally not shy in showing their disapproval, I have declared the show a roaring success!&quot;. St George&apos;s, which has cost \u00a32.4m to produce so far, uses barley from East Anglia and water from the Breckland aquifer, through a 160ft borehole in the garden. The company plans to produce between 150,000 and 200,000 bottles a year, holding back about 1,000 barrels for 20-year-old whisky. The whisky is being shipped to Japan, Singapore, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Next year, the company hopes to crack the US market and Hong Kong. The Scotch whisky business is not quaking yet. As the Scotch Whisky Association pointed out, there are 109 distilleries in Scotland, one in Wales, one in Northern Ireland, and one in England. Scotch outsells the next largest whisky category (US) by more than three times worldwide. &quot;It is testament to the global success of Scotch that other countries are also looking to make whisky and we welcome our Norfolk friends to the world whisky family,&quot; said a spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2009/dec/03/games-gameculture", "sentences": ["This moment-to-moment experience does the heavy lifting for pedagogical goals; they&apos;re not simply in the game&apos;s representational surface.&quot; The aim then, is an almost unconscious assimilation of the underlying skills, and it&apos;s something we&apos;re seeing in other approaches to pedagogical gaming - for example, the experimental projects created by the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-10T21:41:12Z", "title": "Serious games case study: the RPG that could save lives", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "MMORPG", "Role playing games"], "article": "Getting children to cross the road safely has never been easy. In the seventies, we had David Prowse dressed up as the Green Cross Code man, desperately cashing in on the popularity of the Superman films (and Prowse&apos;s role in Star Wars, of course) to grab the attention of parka-wearing youngsters. More recently, there was the phone video ad, which showed realistic footage of a teenager&apos;s road accident seemingly recorded on a friend&apos;s mobile.  These measures have been reasonably effective. According to the Department for Transport, which has an ongoing THINK! road safety campaign, the number of children killed on Britain&apos;s roads has fallen by more than 50% since the mid-1990s. However, there is still work to be done, especially with the &apos;tweenager demographic: in 2008, 17 children aged between 10 and 12 were killed on roads while more than 2,500 were injured.  So how do you talk to these kids? Increasingly, the answer does not seem to be television. Over the past decade we&apos;ve seen toy and fizzy drink manufacturers increasingly moving their marketing online, with ever more effective interactive offerings. Public services, charities and other benevolent organisations are learning that if you really want to engage a young audience, forget the idiot box - make them a game.On November 19, the Department for Transport launched Code of Everand, an MMORPG designed to help children learn, and understand the importance of, safe road crossing. The fantasy-themed game takes place in the land of Everand, which is criss-crossed with &apos;spirit channels&apos; - dangerous lanes of energy where monsters lurk. Players take on the role of Pathfinders who must safely traverse these lanes by looking left and right, spotting creatures and defeating them with a range of attacks and spells. It&apos;s an ingenious device, effectively equating road crossing with the random battles that happen throughout traditional RPG environments. Players must also accrue Concentration Points, which aid in the defeat of enemies - a reference, of course, to the importance of paying attention when crossing busy streets. Although it sounds overtly didactic, this is an impressively rich RPG in its own right. There are dozens of attacks to collect, each more effective on different types of enemy. Talking to NPCs opens up quests, just as in a standard role-playing game, and once you&apos;ve completed them you earn cash which can be spent on on an array of clothing, armour and weaponry options. The inventory is impressively complex, providing a wealth of customisation possibilities, and progress is auto-saved so you can pick up the game whenever you&apos;re in front of a computer with a web browser.      Frank Lantz and Kevin Slavin of Area/Code, the developer behind Code of Everand.    There&apos;s a social element too. Inhabitants can communicate with each other via a series of set conversational phrases, and can accompany each other on quests - apparently some tasks can only be completed in this way. Based in New York, developer Area/Code is an experienced operator in the casual, social and pervasive gaming sectors. More used to working with advertising agencies and media firms on campaigns for the likes of Nike, Nokia and MTV, this is a cutting edge operation. And it has certainly taken the project seriously, as managing director Kevin Slavin explains, &quot;A team of 27 people worked on the game, and that&apos;s not including subcontractors. It was about a one-year development period. Some of that time was spent building the game, but it&apos;s not a linear development process. The finished product reflects a lot of testing, evaluation, and iteration, all to make sure that the game does everything we want it to do.&quot; But wouldn&apos;t it have just been easier to bung out a quick Frogger clone with the amphibian road hopper replaced by a hapless teen? Didn&apos;t they feel the need to communicate the message more explicitly? &quot;Our underlying philosophy regarding is that good games are implicitly educational,&quot; explains Slavin. &quot;Chess can teach you about logic, football can teach you about teamwork, real-time strategy games can teach you about planning. All games can teach you about how interactive systems behave, about succeeding through discipline and practice, and about creative problem-solving. &quot;The opportunity is to harness the ways that games build, influence and reinforce cognitive skills, and apply that to a particular problem or subject domain. First, the heart of the game addresses the subject. What is the player actually doing when they engage with your underlying game system? This moment-to-moment experience does the heavy lifting for pedagogical goals; they&apos;re not simply in the game&apos;s representational surface.&quot; The aim then, is an almost unconscious assimilation of the underlying skills, and it&apos;s something we&apos;re seeing in other approaches to pedagogical gaming - for example, the experimental projects created by the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab. Indeed, the experience of playing Everand will be hugely familiar to anyone who&apos;s experience a browser-based RPG like Pardus or Fallen Sword. And according to lead developer Frank Lantz, it is from these, and more tradition RPG titles, that the company drew inspirations, rather than from the &apos;serious games&apos; sector. &quot;We looked at a lot of the kid-focused MMOs, including RuneScape, Maple Story, Dofus and of course we are influenced by World of Warcraft and other high-end MMOs. I would also point to J-RPGs like Dragon Quest and Etrian Odyssey as influences on our turn-based battle-system.&quot; Two weeks after the launch there were over 20,000 subscribers. Within 48 hours, users were making YouTube videos of the game (surely as reliable a barometer of approval as you&apos;re going to get these days). &quot;What we&apos;ve seen in the data is that most players spend a half-hour or so playing at any given time, most commonly when school lets out,&quot; says Slavin. &quot;There are extremes... one kid spent over 31 hours playing in a week - we don&apos;t recommend that, but we think it speaks well to the power of games to engage players. If they are going to be playing something that much, better that it&apos;s a game that produces cognitive changes around real-world safety...&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/11/google-undersea-cable-asia", "sentences": ["When it opens for business in 2012, the SJC will run 3,000 miles from Singapore to Japan - with branches reaching out to Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand and Guam."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-11T10:09:58Z", "title": "Google backs world's fastest internet cable", "tags": ["Google", "Telecommunications industry", "Telecoms", "Internet", "Technology", "Business", "World news", "Japan", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "In little more than a decade, Google has conquered the technology industry and become one of the world&apos;s most powerful companies. Its latest undertaking, however, may be one of its most ambitious: a giant undersea cable that will significantly speed up internet access around the globe.  The Californian search engine is part of a consortium that confirmed its plans to install the new Southeast Asia Japan Cable (SJC) yesterday, the centrepiece of a $400m (\u00a3245m) project that will create the highest capacity system ever built.  Google is undertaking the scheme with a number of Asian telecommunications companies, including Japan&apos;s KDDI and India&apos;s Reliance Globalcom. The agreement to build the submarine cable was first proposed three years ago, but negotiations finally came to a close on Wednesday as officials signed what they promised was a groundbreaking deal. &quot;We will now be uniquely positioned to provide our customers voice, internet and data services across the entire Asian continent,&quot; said Punit Garg, the chief executive of Reliance.  When it opens for business in 2012, the SJC will run 3,000 miles from Singapore to Japan - with branches reaching out to Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand and Guam. In total, it will consist of more than 5,000 miles of cable, sunk deep under the seabed. The move is intended to boost the amount of capacity available for phone calls and internet traffic by bringing new. In turn, this should ease any potential congestion and make it easier for communications traffic to route around the world. The SJC is set to break records by allowing up to 17 terabits of data to be sent every second - the equivalent of around 250m telephone lines, and large enough to allow the contents of every single book in the British Library to be transferred 20 times per second. And as if that was not enough, the line is also upgradeable and could eventually run as fast as 23Tbps - space for another 88m phone lines. It is not the first time that Google has made significant investments in the physical infrastructure that underpins the internet. Recently, the company took a leading role in developing a parallel project to build the $300m Unity cable, which will run a high-capacity line from Japan to Los Angeles. Demand for connectivity has grown drastically in recent years, thanks to increased internet traffic. Research company TeleGeography pinned annual growth between 2002 and 2007 at around 63% per year, and expects demand to double each year until 2012. Earlier this year a new line running into east Africa was finally completed, promising to bring improved broadband to countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2009/dec/11/michael-white-economy-money", "sentences": ["The spectacle of the bankers threatening to go off to Switzerland or Singapore (my God, have they ever visited Singapore?)"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-11T11:38:33Z", "title": "UK economy in peril: follow the money, not the pundits", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Pre-budget report", "Media", "Business", "Banking", "Banks and building societies", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Money", "Pre-budget report 2009"], "article": "&quot;This is the most anonymous cabinet I can remember,&quot; growled an old friend I bumped into on the Christmas geniality circuit yesterday. Since he is a former Whitehall official who worked for six prime ministers, I take his views seriously. &quot;Nonsense,&quot; I replied. &quot;Name me four members of John Major&apos;s cabinet in 1997.&quot; When he came up with Virginia Bottomley, I suggested the explanation might be that a man of his age probably fancied the then-health/heritage secretary. Chummy is half-right, of course. Apart from Major, the shattered survivors of the long march of Thatcherism by 1997 still included Hezza, the indestructible Ken Clarke, Michael Howard and Douglas Hogg, of later moat fame. But Roger Freeman, Ian Lang, Mickey Forsyth, Gillian Shepherd, Paddy Mayhew, William Waldegrave, assorted Pattens, Michael Portillo? They have slipped down the memory holes as Trollope&apos;s fictional politicians did, as we all do. I hear Portillo is on TV sometimes nowadays, a fate more anonymous than it used to be. So it will be for most of the current crop. But I reminded my friend that they still include Brown himself, Alistair Darling and Jack Straw \u2013 the three survivors of Blair&apos;s first cabinet \u2013 Peter Mandelson and Harriet Harman too, though they both had a cabinet career break. Alan Johnson is well known. David Miliband will be around for a long time \u2013 it&apos;s not just Hillary Clinton who thinks so. But my old Whitehall chum (he first poured drinks for Harold Wilson) bailed out before those two were on his radar, so they don&apos;t count. I mention this to underline the fragility of memory, the flexibility of what passes for conventional wisdom. Does it get worse in the forgettable age of 24/7 media \u2013 or am I just getting old and grouchy like my friend(s)? Thus Wednesday&apos;s pre-budget report was savaged in most of yesterday&apos;s newspapers. But it&apos;s a safe bet that, by New Year, the conventional wisdom will have moved on and the reasons for attacking it been changed utterly. The BBC&apos;s Nick Robinson reported this morning that there were rows between No 10 and No 11 over the shape of the budget, amplifying Patrick Wintour&apos;s lead story in today&apos;s Guardian that Alistair Darling would have preferred to have raised \u00a34.8bn from a 1% VAT hike rather than a 1% NICs hike, but was ground down by the chap next door. Nothing unusual about that. Most PMs and chancellors fight and eventually fall out, as Mrs T did with all hers and Tony Blair famously did with his at least half the time. There is usually some right on both sides. Darling is unusual in having seen off Brown&apos;s barely-concealed desire to replace him with his consigliere, Ed Balls. Good. I&apos;ve always been a fan of Darling, a modest man who is tougher than he looks, though I never cultivated him: too loyal to the team (to both Blair and Brown), too discreet, not egotistical enough to be a good source for hacks. As I&apos;ve noted here before, one of my children works for the chancellor nowadays, which complicates things: another reason to keep a prudent distance. As one colleague put it when telling me last night about his daughter&apos;s new career: &quot;I can&apos;t tell you that, Dad, it&apos;s a secret.&quot; Both Darling and Sam White were circulating among officials, analysts and journalists at last night&apos;s Treasury reception. I spoke to them both, albeit briefly, but mostly to economic writers from other publications whom I rarely see. That&apos;s where Robinson picked up this morning&apos;s BBC report, I&apos;d guess, chatting with all and sundry. No 10 will instantly have sussed that from a glance at the diary. Most of the hacks I spoke to \u2013 like most I read earlier in the day \u2013 seemed agreed that Darling&apos;s pre-budget report didn&apos;t do enough to tackle the debt mountain or reassure the money markets, on whom we depend to fund the debt. For their part, ministers present defended what they&apos;d done: both the uncertainty of the economy&apos;s recovery and the political timetable point to the need to delay the savage cuts that await public services \u2013 far bigger than the tax hikes that await us all. After an initially calm reaction in the City on Wednesday, investors decided to panic yesterday \u2013 herd instinct again \u2013 and sold British Treasury gilts. The FTSE rose a little; the money has to go somewhere. We&apos;ll see what happens next. One erudite pundit I&apos;ve known for decades assured me that the credit agencies that clipped Greek and Spanish credit this week will reduce the UK from a triple-A rating to a double-A soon enough. Another economic pundit who sits even further up the media food chain, whom I&apos;d only just met, told me that they won&apos;t. &quot;If they downgraded Britain they&apos;d have to downgrade the US too \u2013 and they can&apos;t do that,&quot; he chuckled. So much for the wisdom of credit agencies, the people who slumbered as the investment banks blew their collective gasket. Correction: as the banks, the regulators and the British government ran amok in their different ways. One thing that was striking in last night&apos;s chit-chat was the affection, even respect, for the aforementioned Darling, a calm man with a very awkward inheritance. It was offset by hostility to Brown, some of it among people who used to be big fans. &quot;I believed Gordon for the first five years,&quot; admitted someone who should have been warier. The BBC&apos;s Robert Preston, absent last night, is in that camp too. His Brownite book, Brown&apos;s Britain (2005), did not read well at the time and reads less well by the day. There are plenty in that position. Not me, as it happens. Forced to choose between what Brown or Blair, I was saying I usually went with Blair \u2013 or neither. But I did argue that Brown had earned his chance to succeed Blair and, fingers crossed, we&apos;d have to see how it turned out. In 2007 there was no alternative \u2013 still isn&apos;t, really, and that&apos;s why he&apos;s still there. But the verdict of the hacks drinking Treasury Special Brew was that history will be very hard on Chancellor Brown. I asked one of my economic pundits who was to blame for the current financial crisis. &quot;Brown by a proportion of 70% to 30%. He lost control of public expenditure. If we&apos;d entered this recession with a small surplus, say 1%, instead of a structural hole of 6% to 7%, we&apos;d be in much better shape,&quot; he replied. As a non-economist, I&apos;m much more inclined to blame the bankers, as regular readers know. My City reporting chum leans the other way, of course. &quot;I&apos;ll go no further than 60:40,&quot; he conceded. Me, I stick to my guns. The spectacle of the bankers threatening to go off to Switzerland or Singapore (my God, have they ever visited Singapore?) in a fit of righteous anger over Darling&apos;s threat to their bonuses surely tells us quite a lot. &quot;They&apos;re like the miners in 1983; they still don&apos;t get it,&quot; genial Digby Jones said when I bumped into him elsewhere this week. Today&apos;s Guardian carries an interesting report from the French quarter of South Kensington \u2013 so handy for the Lyc\u00e9e \u2013 suggesting why French bankers won&apos;t be going home, even without Brown&apos;s claimed victory in persuading Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel to tax their bank bonuses too. Too much red tape, too miserable at home, said some. Do bear that thought in mind before emigrating or jumping off a bridge. The Times&apos;s Anatole Kaletsky, a pundit I respect, argues gloomily that Darling has bombed the banks to all our disadvantage. But one of the nice things about Kaletsky&apos;s columns is that every new year he writes one admitting everything he got wrong.

The owner of the music, games and DVD chain, as well as bookseller Waterstone&apos;s and online stores, said the music line-up, in particular, was strong this Christmas. Top sellers so far were albums by contestants from the X Factor TV series along with Susan Boyle&apos;s debut album I Dreamed a Dream, said chief executive Simon Fox. &quot;We had a record Christmas last year and in terms of absolute sales, because we clearly have more stores, we will beat our sales numbers all being well for the weeks ahead,&quot; he said. &quot;We think the line-up of product looks strong,&quot; he added, citing Top Gear-related products such as the Where&apos;s Stig? book, Harry Potter products and Delia Smith&apos;s latest Christmas book. HMV makes all its profit in its second half and has opened temporary, or &quot;pop-up&quot;, stores in places where it does not have permanent outlets to tap into the Christmas rush and make the most of gaps left by the collapse of rivals Zavvi and Woolworths. Fox said the stores had exceeded HMV&apos;s expectations so far. He was speaking after HMV revealed its pre-tax loss in the six months to 24 October narrowed to \u00a324.9m, from a loss of \u00a327.5m last year. The company flagged up progress for new ventures in live music and cinema, part of its strategy to diversify beyond revenue streams from older forms of media. &quot;We want our customers&apos; full entertainment spend, whether they are at home watching the DVD or whether they are going out to a gig or a film,&quot; said Fox. But he would not comment on speculation that HMV is considering a bid for its live music business partner Mama, the Aim-listed group behind venues including London&apos;s Jazz Cafe. The company also said it had enjoyed &quot;strong&quot; market share gains in all entertainment categories, and the collapse of bookseller Borders UK last month will present it with the opportunity to increase market share further in the medium term. On the downside, the book market looks likely to be disrupted by Borders&apos; closing down sales over Christmas. Waterstone&apos;s is already under pressure, having reported a 5.1% fall in first-half like-for-like sales but Fox was optimistic despite fierce competition from online retailers. &quot;There is absolutely room for a high-street specialist,&quot; he said. The wider HMV group has faced a challenging times overseas. Its business in Ireland suffered from the ongoing economic turmoil there while markets in Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore were also tough. A weak release schedule for games compounded problems, HMV said, echoing the high-street retailer Game Group which this week shocked investors with news of a sharp sales fall. HMV&apos;s shares slipped back after the results as analysts flagged up tough competition ahead from both online retailers and supermarkets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/13/bonus-tax-darling-city", "sentences": ["Only time will tell if the Square Mile&apos;s movers and shakers really will act on their threats to up sticks and move to Switzerland or Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-13T00:05:15Z", "title": "Pushed too far: how Labour lost patience with the banks", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Banking", "Pre-budget report", "Alistair Darling", "Financial crisis", "Credit crunch", "Pre-budget report 2009"], "article": "Under a heavy sky the colour of gunmetal, relieved only by the bright digital ticker rolling around the side of the Reuters building, there was an air of glum resignation in Canary Wharf on Wednesday, as a few miles along the Thames in Westminster Alistair Darling stood up to announce an unprecedented tax raid on bankers&apos; bonuses. &quot;It was inevitable \u2013 not unexpected, not fair, but inevitable,&quot; said a man on his way out of One Canada Square about the 50% levy on bonuses over \u00a325,000. &quot;It is showboating. People are not particularly angry, they are just resigned to it. It is just life, you know \u2013 an easy win for them. But it is not going to get them out of the dire situation they are in.&quot; A foreign exchange trader agreed there had been relatively little complaint among the staff still employed among the glass and steel skyscrapers that became a symbol of Britain&apos;s triumphant finance sector during the boom years. &quot;Death and taxes are the only things that are definite. There has generally been a tightening of the belts this year anyway. To have a job this year in banking in Canary Wharf is not a bad thing,&quot; he said. It may have seemed all but inevitable to the money men in Canary Wharf by last Wednesday, but to the Labour government in Westminster, clawing back bonuses would have been unthinkable a few short months ago. Since the summer, Darling and his ministerial colleagues have come a very long way \u2013 from standing back to let the City put itself back on its feet to persuading other nations to adopt a swingeing tax on bank pay. During the early months of the crisis, the Treasury made clear that it would stick to its hands-off, arm&apos;s-length approach to the Square Mile. When the government was forced to step in and bail out the shattered Northern Rock, and later RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, some on the Labour left giddily remarked that it was the final culmination of the the old Leninist desire to take control of the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of the economy. Yet the Treasury continued to stick as closely as it could to a laissez-faire policy with its new shareholdings, and the overall message remained that the City was a crucial engine of growth for UK plc, whose competitiveness must be protected, and whose reputation deserved to be restored. &quot;The default is still &apos;the City knows best; the markets know best&apos;,&quot; says Neal Lawson, of left-wing thinktank Compass. But once the worst of the financial panic had passed and stock markets began to pick up again, it rapidly became clear that neither the partly state-owned banks, nor their more fortunate independent rivals, had any intention of assisting in the Treasury&apos;s careful confidence-building exercise with the public. Not only were expressions of humility or remorse from the banks&apos; senior management few and far between, but they embarked on a series of steps that almost seemed calculated to rile the public \u2013 and the politicians. Senior management at RBS were eventually forced to back down after a high-profile stand-off with the chancellor, who had insisted on a veto over their pay policies; but Barclays is working on ways to increase the pay of its investment bankers by a rumoured 150%, and even possibly backdating it. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, which have large London operations, announced strong results, and indicated that they would, once again, be setting aside bumper bonus pools for their staff, with little sign of duty or gratitude to the taxpayer. Finally, as it began to dawn on ministers that they could be faced with a string of banks announcing generous bonuses in the early months of next year, just as the country was gearing up for a general election, the government realised that it would have to take a far tougher line. One of the first signs of a new-found determination to face down the City came last month, when the prime minister stunned anti-poverty campaigners by abruptly putting his weight behind a tax on financial transactions, something they had been demanding for years. Brown told an audience in Edinburgh that a new &quot;social contract&quot; between the financial sector and the public was needed \u2013 and officials swung into action, pushing the issue with their overseas counterparts, some of whom had already long been in favour of the idea, and trying to stir up international support. But a &quot;Tobin tax&quot;, as it is known, named after the economist who invented it, is a long-term solution, and ministers were still stuck with the short-term problem of unrepentant financiers promising themselves lavish payouts. The Conservatives gleefully added to their discomfort as George Osborne announced that if he were in charge at No 11, he would immediately ban all cash bonuses for this year. For several weeks, as public anger simmered, officials worked on ways of using the tax system to drive home the point that the financial sector was behaving irresponsibly \u2013 and raise cash at the same time. Their starting point was a one-off, across-the-board windfall tax on the banks&apos; profits \u2013 but this directly contradicted the government&apos;s insistence that the banks&apos; first priority should be to use the money they were making to build up their depleted capital bases. A hefty &quot;supertax&quot; on the bankers themselves was also weighed up by the number-crunchers in Horse Guards Road; but identifying an individual as a &quot;banker&quot; in a legally watertight way was very difficult, and ministers argued that it was the senior management at the firms, rather than the individual traders or investment bankers, whose behaviour they wanted to influence. So, with the final decision taken only last weekend, as the chancellor put the finishing touches to his report, the Treasury opted for taxing the banks&apos; bonus pools \u2013 the proportion of their profits they set aside to pay to their star staff. City minister Lord Myners \u2013 who made his fortune by setting up fund management firm Gartmore \u2013 was involved in designing the measure. He argues that the banks left standing in the wake of the crisis have benefited hugely both from the collapse of weaker rivals and their public bailouts, so profits generated in the past 12 months have been the result of sheer luck, not financial genius: as he puts it, &quot;We don&apos;t pay the weathermen when the weather&apos;s good&quot;. Myners personally called the chairman or chief executive of the major UK banks on Wednesday to face down their criticisms as the chancellor prepared to deliver his pre-budget report. Later that day, treasury adviser Geoffrey Spence, himself a former banker, made calls to the major investment banking heads to remind them of the necessity of adherence to the tax. Treasury officials were also busy behind the scenes explaining the tax plan to G7 countries, including the US, where officials are continuing to examine it in detail. Darling is thought to have received positive messages from Democratic congressmen \u2013 but sources acknowledge this is far from an indication that the US is ready to follow the French in copying the UK&apos;s move. Even less predictable, however, is the response of the banks themselves. Myners insists that the Treasury wins either way \u2013 either bonus payments are slashed, showing bank bosses have heeded the government&apos;s demands, or they remain obstinately high and the Treasury gets a chunky tax take. Some banks appear determined to take the government on. John Varley, chief executive of Barclays, and boardroom colleague Bob Diamond, who runs its investment banking arm Barclays Capital, were the most vocal during the week in warning of a possible exodus as a result of the policy. Plenty of other senior City figures were ready to issue veiled threats in private that financial services would suffer long-term damage from the political change of mood. &quot;It just doesn&apos;t help the prospects of the City. One of the things businesses don&apos;t like is political interference \u2013 and the fact the Tories are not opposing it makes matters worse,&quot; one said. Nevertheless, Lawson, of Compass, says last week&apos;s bonus levy could come to be seen as a watershed. &quot;This is the thin end of a much bigger wedge about the relationship between business and society, rich and poor,&quot; he says. Back among the towers of Canary Wharf last week, not everyone was disagreeing with Lord Myners&apos;s argument that the banks have made easy pickings. As one trader put it: &quot;Morally speaking, you can&apos;t say that trading desks could have ever generated the revenues they&apos;ve done without the support of the governments. The rally in rates, credit, all came as a result of government intervention.&quot; But there was resentment, too. &quot;There is a natural public reaction to people earning disproportionate amounts, especially given how much they have had to be helped out. But at the end of the day these people have been taken on to do a job on a contract, and that contract should be honoured because we live in a contract law society,&quot; said one Canary Wharf worker on Wednesday. &quot;It is a little bit unfair to change rules retrospectively when people have committed in good faith to do a job.&quot; Another said: &quot;I don&apos;t mention I work in banking any more. I would rather tell them I am an IT consultant. Everyone was happy when they were making huge taxes from banking \u2013 the FSA was happy, the government was happy when everything was going swimmingly \u2013 and when the credit crunch hits someone has to take the blame.&quot; Despite the uncertainty, the bars in the Broadgate complex on the edge of Liverpool Street station, a major hub in the City, were humming as much as they always do last Friday lunchtime. Champagne was being quaffed, secret-Santa presents were being exchanged and jokes were being shared. Only time will tell if the Square Mile&apos;s movers and shakers really will act on their threats to up sticks and move to Switzerland or Singapore.

Taking a break from a three-month stint in Singapore, he had come to ride Duff, the sole Irish runner at the most international shindig in world racing. But he could have been forgiven if most of his thoughts were far from the high-rise backdrop and massive stands of Sha Tin racecourse. John Oxx recently waved goodbye both to Sea The Stars, who went off to stud in October, and to Mick Kinane, who retired last week, and is expected to announce the identity of his jockey&apos;s successor at today&apos;s Irish Horse Racing awards. While nothing in racing is certain until the &quot;weighed in&quot; has been signalled, and sometimes not even then, the elevation of Berry to No 1 jockey at Oxx&apos;s yard is widely expected \u2013 not least because the 28-year-old son of the 10-times Irish jumps champion Frank Berry has been second jockey at Currabeg since 2002. &quot;It&apos;s a great set-up,&quot; says Berry. &quot;The boss has a very good team and I&apos;m very grateful to his owners for their support over the years. &quot;I was working with Johnny Murtagh for my first few years there and with Mick for the last five or six. It would be an honour were I to take over from him but it would be only a change of rank, really.&quot; A mark of Berry&apos;s versatility is that he was the only jockey taking part in yesterday&apos;s bonanza of Flat racing who has ridden a winner at the Cheltenham Festival \u2013 Khayrawani in the 1999 Coral Cup. &quot;I was struggling a little with my weight towards the latter part of my apprenticeship,&quot; he explains, &quot;and it was part of a natural progression to go jumping for four or five winters.&quot; And it is a measure of his ability that he was odds-on favourite for the Irish champion jockey title in August 2005 when his season \u2013 and potentially his career \u2013 was derailed by a horrendous fall at The Curragh which left him with multiple fractures. &quot;I had never broke a bone in my body before,&quot; he says, &quot;and when I did, I did it in style&quot; \u2013 to such an extent that he was unable to sit on a horse at all, led alone ride one at racing pace, for eight months. Conversation about the Oxx stable can never get far before Sea The Stars appears. &quot;Everybody was excited about him from the very beginning,&quot; says Berry, who rode the horse in much of his exercise. &quot;He had a presence about him that you don&apos;t see in most horses, and he stood out in everything he did. Even when you rode him in a quiet canter up the all-weather gallop you could sense that you had so much under you.&quot; With major change in the offing, did Duff play his part and win the Hong Kong Mile to give Berry his first Group One winner? Well, no \u2013 but he ran well before fading in the straight behind the local hero Good Ba Ba, who was landing the race for the third consecutive year. This made Good Ba Ba the only horse in the history of the Hong Kong International meeting to win three races at the fixture. Earlier in the afternoon a horse with whom the locals are even more besotted had set the cavernous Sha Tin stands on a roar when Sacred Kingdom won the Sprint for the second time, heading a Hong Kong 1-2-3-4 in the race. Overseas challengers won the other two international contests \u2013 or, to be fair, French challengers did. The Aga Khan&apos;s filly Daryakana, trained by Alain de Royer-Dupre, swooped late to wrench the Vase from Spanish Moon, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, by a short head, with Fran\u00e7ois Doumen&apos;s redoubtable Kasbah Bliss \u2013 better known in England as a long-distance hurdler \u2013 a neck back in third. The day&apos;s most valuable event, the Hong Kong Cup, was stylishly won by Vision d&apos;Etat, whose jockey Olivier Peslier became the most successful jockey in Hong Kong International history, with seven winners."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/14/abu-dhabi-rescue-of-dubai-world-may-be-nothing-of-the-sort", "sentences": ["Will they all choose Singapore, or will some fancy the south of France?"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-14T20:07:43Z", "title": "Abu Dhabi's 'rescue' of Dubai may be nothing of the sort", "tags": ["Dubai World", "Business", "Dubai", "Market turmoil", "United Arab Emirates", "Eurozone crisis"], "article": "Is the $10bn on its way from Abu Dhabi and Dubai a gift, a loan or the proceeds of a behind-the-scenes asset sale?

Dubai nevertheless boasted about its commitment to &quot;transparency&quot;. It will have to do more to make the word mean something. It is simply not credible to pretend that what happens behind closed palace doors is none of the outside world&apos;s business. International investors, after all, will now be engaged in a high-stakes game of assessing the chance of further &quot;funding&quot; emerging from Abu Dhabi. Look at what happened yesterday. Holders of the $4.1bn Islamic bond issued by Nakheel, Dubai World&apos;s property developer, are being paid in full. Some of the owners are Johnny-come-lately hedge funds who were buying at 30 cents in the dollar only a couple of weeks ago. The threat by some of these funds to make legal mischief appears to have paid dividends. Could the same argy-bargy be repeated as Dubai World sets about restructuring the rest of its debt? The hope in Dubai and Abu Dhabi is that a newly-established legal framework, complete with high-powered tribunal, would spring into action if Dubai World fails. It is certainly sensible to have a few legal weapons to throw at the market. But it&apos;s probably a fantasy to think international investors wouldn&apos;t push for a second bailout from Abu Dhabi if they don&apos;t like the look of the restructuring terms. That&apos;s the problem here. Abu Dhabi has given the impression that it has bailed out Dubai. What it has really done is write a large cheque in the hope that it won&apos;t have to write an even bigger one. That&apos;s a formula for confusion and agitation. &quot;Our best days are yet to come,&quot; boasts Dubai. They are if you are a lawyer there. Sweet nothings Todd Stitzer came quoting Thomas Paine&apos;s thoughts on independence. It was his own, more prosaic lines about the profit margins available to Cadbury that caught the ear \u2013 18% from turning commodities like cocoa, milk and sugar into Wispas and Creme Eggs and the like. Is that credible? Well, 16%-18% by 2013, which was the precise wording, is ambitious \u2013 but it is certainly not absurd. It helps that Cadbury&apos;s current target of &quot;mid teens by 2011&quot; has virtually been achieved already. Adding a little extra is not asking shareholders to believe in miracles. Okay, the details were a little sketchy, but Stitzer said enough about growth in emerging markets and the potential for internal cost savings to be convincing. All in all, it was a low-key but adequate first defence to Kraft&apos;s miserly opening offer. Kraft&apos;s terms were worth 727p at the last count, which is feeble when you consider that Andrew Wood at Bernstein Research, one of the top-rated analysts in the sector, thinks Cadbury&apos;s shares could be trading at 873p this time next year on the basis on 20-year average earnings multiples. It may be optimistic to assume that 20-year averages are the right yardstick, but you get the point: Cadbury investors have little to fear from independence, especially now that the management has made a hard commitment to lift the dividend by 10% a year. So it is \u2013 still \u2013 up to Kraft to improve its terms substantially come mid-January, when the real action begins. This column&apos;s view remains the same: Cadbury chairman Roger Carr would be mad to open the books to Kraft, Hershey, or anybody else at a price less than 900p a share.

Observing that the tax take as a share of the economy is close to a 50-year low, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman used parliamentary privilege to refer to &quot;non-doms such as Lord Ashcroft&quot;. If Green David Cameron had been present he might well have felt aggrieved, as Tory party officials do. Only on Sunday he assured the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr that he hopes as a matter of urgency to amend a passing bit of legislative flotsam (Jack Straw&apos;s constitutional renewal bill) to ensure that legislators, peers and MPs both, must be &quot;ordinarily resident and domiciled&quot; in the UK for tax purposes. Teased by Straw about loopholes, Cameron even tightened the wording. What more can an opposition leader do, embarrassed aides ask? There are many answers to that, but the most obvious is that Cameron should require his billionaire party apparatchik, Lord Michael Ashcroft (famously described by Peter Oborne as &quot;the man who bought the Tory party&quot;) to stop coy games about his tax status. Though the buccaneer Caribbean businessman was required to take up UK residence as a condition of his peerage in 2000, Cameron and shadow cabinet colleagues are still reduced to wriggling because Ashcroft stubbornly refuses to say it. &quot;You can ask me about my sex and gender. You can ask whether I have two testicles and a penis. But [on tax] I do not respond,&quot; he tells some inquirers. If his coyness is just bluff it is costly bluff. No one knows. It is not that other parties are not also supported by wealthy people who may live in Britain but are non-domiciled for tax purposes. Lord Paul, Indian-born steel magnate and longstanding Labour insider, is one such. Lakshmi Mittal, even richer, is another. Nick Clegg&apos;s team has yet to repay a \u00a32.4m donation from a fraudster with tenuous UK links before he was jailed here. Such donors may be bigger contributors than Ashcroft, now down to 4% of Tory funds, Tories insist. But that misses the point. In the Hague years Ashcroft was party treasurer and main donor; since 2005 merely a deputy chairman but one who runs \u2013 and indirectly funds \u2013 much of the key marginal seats campaign. When Cameron says it is a private matter he sounds afraid of Ashcroft. Tory peers have three times blocked mischievous attempts by Lib-Lab peers to tighten the law. Super-Green Zac Goldsmith&apos;s newly-revealed non-dom status, may cost him election victory in liberal Richmond Park. As with bankers bonuses, rich people protest that they contributed hugely to the UK economy and tax base in the boom years: hence the projected 18% collapse in revenue in 2009-10; hence the politicians shared ambition - Tories included - to tax the rich more; hence their retaliatory threat to flee to Geneva or Singapore. Brown, Alistair Darling, Cameron, Cable and George Osborne know they tread on thin ice because the financial sector has become the UK&apos;s &quot;monocrop,&quot; like oil in Saudi Arabia.

The things that have really inspired me are talking to young people whose lives have been turned around.&quot; The contrast with his predecessor is neatly summed up by their respective entries in Who&apos;s Who. He lists his interests as cycling, walking, classical music, cooking and gardening, while Burnham&apos;s are simply football (Everton FC), rugby league (Leigh RFC) and cricket. Bradshaw says he wants to draw attention to Labour&apos;s investment in sport, while also attempting to quell lingering fears that\u00a0the legacy promises made by Seb Coe in Singapore that helped\u00a0secure the Games for London will\u00a0not be met. &quot;There is a hell of a lot going on up and down the country in terms of people getting involved in sport at a grassroots level, which is not\u00a0sexy and it&apos;s not high profile. &quot;It doesn&apos;t hit the national newspaper headlines, but it is making a real difference,&quot; he said, describing trips to Wakefield and Liverpool to see projects such as the \u00a336m Sport Unlimited programme that introduces children to new sportsand a Premier League-backed drive to boost participation in Olympic sports such as table tennis and volleyball. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t want to be in a position where we have an array of gold medals at the Olympics and more armchair sports enthusiasts who are not doing it themselves. That would not be a legacy we could be proud of as a nation.&quot; On the ground, he says, there is huge enthusiasm among teachers and kids. &quot;But there&apos;s still this prejudice out there that school sport is on its uppers, that there are no playing fields left. Sooner or later, the public perception is going to have to catch up with reality,&quot; he says. But opposition MPs and senior figures in the sports world queued up earlier this year to say that the government&apos;s goal of using the Games as a catalyst to get the nation off the sofa and into the leisure centre was foundering. The shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson, has called the lack of a coherent legacy strategy &quot;the single biggest problem with the Olympics&quot;. His Liberal Democrat counterpart, Don Foster, has claimed the &quot;government&apos;s legacy strategy is going badly wrong&quot; and other senior figures in the sports world have also voiced concerns. Of the two million increase promised, Sport England is responsible for one million, with the other half to be delivered by the NHS through increased &quot;physical exercise&quot; \u2013 including gardening and DIY. &quot;There is phenomenal progress being made across the country that is not being recognised,&quot; insists Bradshaw. &quot;None of this is hitting the radar of the public, who still wonder what the Olympics have got to do with them. They think it is a few big stadia and nothing really to do with them. We&apos;re going to have a big push in the new year with Steve Redgrave taking on this role and getting ambassadors to go out at a local and regional level, into schools, to persuade people the Olympics is bringing benefits to the country now but also to persuade people to become more physically active themselves.&quot; In a linked pledge, the government has promised to offer every child of school age five hours of sport a week by 2012. &quot;As recently as 2005, only one in four kids was getting two hours quality sport in schools. That&apos;s now 90%. More than half are getting three hours and we&apos;re confident we&apos;ll hit the five-hour offer by 2012. That is a massive turnaround,&quot; he says. Sport England&apos;s figures released today will show participation levels as measured by its Active People survey. The body is responsible for increasing the number of people playing sport for more than 30 minutes, three times a week by one million. Bradshaw points to the fact\u00a0that 500,000 were added by this measure between 2005/06 and 2007/08. But latterly\u00a0progress has slowed to a crawl. Today&apos;s figures are expected to show further steady, if unspectacular, progress. Companion figures that show how many people play particular sports once a week are again likely to be a mixed bag. The last set of quarterly figures showed that just three recorded an increase, while 10 - including both codes of rugby, gymnastics and rowing - showed a decline. Bradshaw claims this will change when the &quot;Whole Sport Plan&quot; \u2013 the \u00a3480m channelled through governing bodies in a wholesale change of strategy introduced this year \u2013 starts to bear fruit. He expects the increases in participation to be &quot;turbo charged&quot; as 2012 draws closer. Nor will pressure on the public purse result in the funding tap being turned off, he insists. &quot;We&apos;ve had an eight-fold increase in investment in sport since 1997 if you take into account government spending and lottery spending. We&apos;re committed to sustaining that and delivering on our promises,&quot; says Bradshaw, who was once a keen junior tennis player. &quot;But I think we need to do a much better job at getting the message across at local level about what has been achieved and what is our there for people to use and take part in, and the benefits of it.&quot; When he strays on to territory that occupied some of the tenure of his predecessor \u2013 for example in trying to force the dysfunctional forces that oversee the game in England to make progress on issues of governance \u2013 he is less at ease. He is &quot;confident&quot; the 2018 World Cup bid &quot;can succeed&quot; but will not &quot;micro-manage&quot; the board, defends the David Davies report on listed events as a &quot;serious piece of work&quot; despite criticism from the sports affected and insists he will continue to press for the governance reforms of the FA proposed by Lord Burns in 2005 to be implemented in full. Some feel that too many promises have already been loaded on to the 2012 Games and that there should be a more realistic reappraisal of the Olympics as, primarily, a two-week festival of elite sport. But Bradshaw is having none of it, insisting that - if anything - the legacy targets are not ambitious enough. &quot;I think it was absolutely right that we had an ambitious bid. If we hadn&apos;t we wouldn&apos;t have won it. I think the bid is eminently deliverable. In fact, there is no reason why we shouldn&apos;t do even better,&quot; he enthuses. &quot;There is no reason the Olympics shouldn&apos;t act as a catalyst for all sorts of things. It&apos;s right to be ambitious about the Olympics and the potential of them can be even greater than we have yet acknowledged in terms of their impact on people&apos;s lives and how it changes things.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/19/marianne-north-painter-botanist", "sentences": ["Between 1871 and 1879, she visited America, Canada, Jamaica, Brazil, the Canaries, Japan, Singapore, Borneo, Java, Ceylon and India, followed, at the &quot;royal command&quot; of Charles Darwin, by Australia and New Zealand."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-19T00:10:56Z", "title": "Travels with my brush | Gardens", "tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style", "Painting", "Gardening advice"], "article": "These dark weeks of the year, when everything turns to soggy mush, can make even the most enthusiastic among us fall out of love with the garden. There&apos;s no better time, then, to rekindle a sense of wonder at the plant kingdom with a visit to Kew Gardens. Ignore those majestic glasshouses, though, for in\u00a0one modest, red-brick building you&apos;ll find a botanical firework display featuring likenesses of nearly 1,000 astonishing plants \u2013 larger than life, brighter than the crown jewels, and all painted by one\u00a0remarkable woman. This is the newly restored Marianne North Gallery, which houses 833 of North&apos;s paintings, the fruits of a self-taught, middle-aged Victorian woman&apos;s travels to some of the world&apos;s most distant corners. North loathed the British winter: from childhood, she dreamed of the\u00a0tropics, her imagination fired by\u00a0a bunch of exotic red flowers (Amherstia nobilis) given to her by Sir William Hooker, Kew&apos;s first director and a friend of her father. North and her father were inseparable: her mother, who died when North was 24, extracted a deathbed promise that she would never leave him, and for 39 years she remained a\u00a0devoted daughter. When he died in 1869, she was finally free to marry \u2013 but she had other ideas. Like many women of her class, North had received lessons in\u00a0flower painting, but in 1867 the Australian artist Robert Dowling, while visiting for Christmas, had taught her to paint in oils. From that day, there was no stopping her. Oil painting, she declared, became a\u00a0&quot;vice, like dram-drinking, almost impossible to leave off once it gets possession of one&quot;. To the consternation of her family, she accepted an invitation to North America, where she planned to paint &quot;its peculiar vegetation on the spot in natural abundant luxuriance&quot;. From there, she set off for Jamaica, arriving &quot;alone and friendless&quot; on Christmas Eve 1871. North couldn&apos;t have been happier. She installed herself in a house in the Botanic Gardens, surrounded by orchids and palms. &quot;I was in a state of ecstasy,&quot; she wrote in her diary, &quot;and hardly knew what to paint first.&quot; She was never friendless for long: &quot;She was wealthy, well connected, but she was clearly also very good company,&quot; says her biographer, Laura Ponsonby. North also had an unerring knack for meeting people who could help her, putting her up for months at a time or passing her on to ever more exotic destinations with letters of introduction. Between 1871 and 1879, she visited America, Canada, Jamaica, Brazil, the Canaries, Japan, Singapore, Borneo, Java, Ceylon and India, followed, at the &quot;royal command&quot; of Charles Darwin, by Australia and New Zealand. Hunger, heat, humidity, filth and homicidal horses were endured with breezy fortitude; only cold really got her down, and the society of empty-headed &quot;croqueting-badminton young ladies&quot;. In 1881, North returned to England to prepare her paintings for her new gallery at Kew, sorting them into geographical order. Predictably, this provoked itchy feet. &quot;All the continents of the world have some sort of representation in my gallery except Africa,&quot; she wrote, &quot;and I resolved to begin painting there without loss of time.&quot; By the next August she was in the Cape painting proteas, followed by trips to the Seychelles and Chile, before her health finally failed and she retired, reluctantly, to\u00a0Gloucestershire. She spent her remaining years writing up her travels, and died, aged 59, in 1890. It is hard for us to appreciate the original impact of North&apos;s paintings, which would have been like images beamed from the surface of the moon. Even the eminent botanists of Kew, who would have known some plants from drawings or dried specimens, had little idea of the habitat in which they grew. North depicted not just the plant, but, for the first time, entire ecosystems. Her importance is less that she discovered plants new to science (though one genus, a tropical tree called Northea seychellana, and four species now bear her name); it is more that she expressed a modern, pioneering sense of the fragility of the plants and places she painted. &quot;She was ahead of her time in so\u00a0many ways \u2013 in her lifestyle, in her painting style, in her ambitions as a conservationist and educator,&quot; says Ponsonby. &quot;She wanted ordinary people to understand where plants came from.&quot; More than that, she shares with us her thrilled delight at the beauty and strangeness of plants. \u2022 The Marianne North Gallery is open daily, 9.30am-3.45pm."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/dec/14/evangelical-marriage-customs", "sentences": ["And at lunch today Adam announced that he had this very morning got engaged to a beautiful and intelligent, (yet dutiful and self-effacing) Singaporean lady, who was here studying a PhD in Astro-Physics, before she returned to Singapore last year."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-21T08:17:21Z", "title": "Christmas fiction: Grace looks for love", "tags": ["Religion", "Christianity"], "article": "An unusual letter has arrived at Cif belief: it appears to be a report from Grace in London to her sister Verity, in Patagonia. They are missionaries&apos; daughters, raised in rural tranquillity, and they find bewildering the customs of the evangelicals of London whom Grace has been sent to serve. Although this account is clearly fictional, it casts light on the marriage customs of some evangelical Christians; also, it made the editor laugh.  Dear Verity, I am now settled at Mr and Mrs Barren&apos;s in London and have begun attending the Abundant Life Temple in Blackfriars, where they sing only from &quot;Hymns of Reformed Faith&quot;. Pastor Hamish Sterling and his wife Sari (both Scottish), are very much against &quot;sensual, aesthetic worship&quot; since it circumvents the mind - the soul being stimulated by music, rather than by any genuine adoration of God. We do need to ensure that we remain on the narrow path of faith that leads to life in these dark and evil days don&apos;t we? I am often fearful I may wander unknowingly onto the broad path, which leads to destruction and become a worldly Christian, fond of dancing... Oh and I was invited to dinner at Pastor and Mrs Sterling&apos;s home - a wonderful penthouse apartment overlooking the Thames - they have been super abundantly blessed by the Lord ... I do hope in time I shall also become that pleasing to our God and Father, so that I am able to strengthen my stewardship and hospitality in His service. Verity, everybody here is so very godly and dignified \u2013 like something from a Jane Austen novel! This is how I always imagined England ... The ladies are not outwardly adorned with make-up, jewellery or fine apparel, which we are warned against in the epistle of Peter. They are all scrubbed and fresh, a little like the new potatoes that Mum cooks up on Sundays. One lady, Emmeline, who is perhaps a little like one of Mum&apos;s slightly older potatoes, said that she actually uses carbolic soap, since it is both unperfumed and a good exfoliator. She had confided in me shortly beforehand that she has been &apos;dating&apos; Adam, one of our taller brothers, for two and a half years! Nothing improper, of course. She meant occasional phone calls, (mainly instigated by Emmeline) and sporadic group coffees, (to prevent passions from becoming inflamed). These exciting incidents were punctuated by long periods of silence, to allow Adam to &quot;lay the matter before the Lord&quot;. This caution is not only honest and commendable but also highly valuable, since it aids our brothers to make sound judgements in discharging their duty to find respectable, godly wives. No nasty honeymoon surprises! Not too much flesh is to be viewed, neither are tight clothes to be worn, as this is not seemly and can be a stumbling block to our brothers. They want only a chaste and unpretentious, yet naturally beautiful wife, who adorns herself instead with the garments of faith. I have noticed so many interesting coincidences, (or rather, I should say, God-incidences). For example, many ladies chosen as brides by our brothers (as Christ chooses us all as his brides) happen to be of quiet, meek spirit, like precious, beautiful lambs, with the purest, clearest, natural, unblemished skin, showing inner purity.  (I shall resume this letter tomorrow)  Oh, Verity, you cannot imagine what happened today! Funnily enough, many of the ladies who have the wonderful qualities I was talking about also happen to be Asian. And at lunch today Adam announced that he had this very morning got engaged to a beautiful and intelligent, (yet dutiful and self-effacing) Singaporean lady, who was here studying a PhD in Astro-Physics, before she returned to Singapore last year. Apparently, he just suddenly felt &apos;led&apos; to begin emailing her and within a week, they were engaged! As Dad always says, &quot;If he&apos;s the right person, wild horses won&apos;t keep him away&quot;... But later I heard Emmeline crying out from behind Pastor&apos;s vestry door &quot;I just want someone to love me for me \u2013 for who I am! Pastor, is this not the fulfilment of Isaiah 4:1, where it says &apos;And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, &apos;We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach?&apos;&quot; (... Wednesday)  Emmeline has since regained her composure. She prostrated herself in prayer and supplication and her faith has now triumphed! She has been delivered a valuable lesson - that we must all wait for &quot;God&apos;s perfect timing&quot;, to receive &quot;God&apos;s perfect choice&quot;, as Mum would say. As testimony to this, just tonight, at the mid-week prayer meeting, Emmeline came forward to the podium to give a testimony of the Lord&apos;s love and grace in her life. She got off to a rather shaky start, hardly able to utter the words she had brought to share with us from the book of Habakkuk, chapter 3, verse 17 yet managed to quaver through sobs:- &quot;Though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall there be fruit in the vines, though the labour of the olive shall fail, neither shall there be herd in the stalls, yet shall I trust in him&quot;. Oh Verity, please do pray sincerely that the Lord would lead Emmeline to the godly man of His choice and that the vine would not wither before it has had a chance to be seeded and to groan with fruit.

The new visa rules, which also apply to other foreign nationals, are apparently a reaction to the arrest in the US of a Mumbai terror suspect, David Coleman Headley, who had entered India on a multiple-entry visa. The British high commission in Delhi has urged the Indian government to rethink the policy, which is expected to hit tourists planning to use India as a base for touring the region. It will also be a blow to thousands of Britons living in India on long-term tourist visas. Many foreigners living in India prefer to use tourist visas rather than go through the complicated process of trying to secure a visa that would grant them the right to residency. Some apply for six-month tourist visas and then travel to nearby countries, such as Nepal, to renew them. Those on longer-term tourist visas \u2011 for five or 10 years \u2011 are also required to leave the country every 180 days and tend to fly out for a couple of days before returning. Under the new rules, that would no longer be an option. Posts on internet travel forums suggest that some British tourists have already fallen foul of the rules and have found themselves stranded and unable to return to India after visiting neighbouring countries. On the IndiaMike forum one poster, from London, described how he had been renting an apartment in Goa and had travelled to Nepal to apply for a new six-month tourist visa, only to be informed that he would not be allowed back in for two months. &quot;This is insane,&quot; he wrote. &quot;How can you introduce a rule without any prior warning and let ppl [sic] make plans and pay for flights etc and mess everything up for them \u2026 I now have no option but to get a transit visa and leg it back to Goa, get my stuff and leave \u2026 all this achieves is me and 1000&apos;s of others having to cut their plans short and spend none of that cash into the system \u2026 Well done!!&quot; A spokesman for the British high commission said the high commissioner had written to protest. &quot;We have discussed this matter with the government of India. As yet there is no real clarity over the details of the proposals or of how they might be implemented. We understand that the Indian government is reconsidering its plans. We shall keep a close eye on this as it develops because it has the potential to impact on a large number of British nationals.&quot; Details of the plans are yet to be published but reports in India suggested that people of Indian origin living in the UK will also be caught up in the rule change. Many British passport holders with Indian origins use tourist visas to visit relatives in India rather than tackling the bureaucratic minefield involved in applying for a Person of Indian Origin card, which would allow them entry into the country. They will also be subject to the no return for two months rule. The Indian government has apparently sought to defuse the row by giving consular officials the power to grant exemptions in exceptional cases, although there is as yet no clarity on how that might be applied. British diplomatic sources also suggested the changes had alarmed some Indian companies with nationals working overseas, who feared that their business interests might be affected if other countries introduced reciprocal arrangements. The decision, by India&apos;s home ministry, comes after officials reviewed the case of Headley, who is under arrest in the US accused of scouting targets for terrorist attacks, including the Mumbai attacks last year which left 166 people dead. He was found to have used a multiple entry business visa to make nine trips to India, during which time he is alleged to have visited a number of potential targets. India has already cracked down on business visas this year, informing thousands of holders that they must return to their home countries and prove that they meet much stricter criteria before new visas will be issued. Ironically, the clampdown comes as the country attempts to boost its tourism industry. Last week the home minister, P Chidambaram, announced the trial introduction of a visa on arrival scheme for citizens of Singapore, Japan, New Zealand, Luxembourg and Finland and said a country the size of India should be attracting at least 50 million visitors a year. About five million tourists visit India every year, including an estimated three quarters of a million Britons. A final draft of the visa regulations is expected to be issued next month but in the meantime a number of embassies in India have notified their citizens of the changes. The Indian embassy in Berlin has also posted the rule on its website, noting that &quot;a minimum gap of two months is mandatory between visits as tourists to India&quot;. The introduction of the new system coincides with a visit to India by the business secretary, Lord Mandelson, who has been trying to calm Indian concerns over changes to Britain&apos;s immigration rules."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/britons-executed-abroad-history", "sentences": ["John Martin, 35, was executed by hanging in Singapore in April 1996 for murdering three tourists, Gerald Lowe in Singapore and Sheila and Darin Damude in Thailand."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-27T17:36:46Z", "title": "Recent history of Britons executed abroad", "tags": ["Capital punishment", "World news", "UK news", "Texas"], "article": "The last Briton to be executed abroad was Jackie Elliott, 42, who died by lethal injection in Huntsville, Texas, in February 2003 having been convicted of rape and murder in 1986.

The story of the ship Exodus and its doomed voyage to break the British blockade of Palestine, with a human cargo of 4,500 Holocaust survivors, was shown on newsreels around the world and was the tipping point of public sympathy for the United Nations vote in November that year to establish a Jewish state. Ike (born Yitzhak) Aronowitz, who has died aged 86, was born in Lodz and grew up in Danzig. Attempts on my part, when I interviewed him in 2007, to arrive at a definitive spelling of his last name were met with frustration. His father took the family to Palestine in 1933 where, after the war started, Ike dreamed of joining the Red Army, but he ended up in the British merchant marine. In 1942, he joined the newly established naval branch of the Haganah military wing, the Palmach, and the Exodus was his first command. The ship, formerly the President Warfield, had already been sold for scrap when a $40,000 collection among American Jews bought it to transport Holocaust survivors to Palestine. Ike, who took over the command of the ship after it reached France, had to evade the French authorities, slipping out of Marseille to the port of S\u00e8te. Although a pilot had been paid to guide them, he didn&apos;t turn up, and Ike undertook a series of tricky manoeuvres to get the ship into open waters. But on board was another captain, Yossi Harel (whom Ike would dismissively refer to by his diaspora name, Hamburger). Sent by the Zionist leadership in Palestine to oversee the expedition, and a more likely candidate for portrayal by Newman, Harel was the one who received the order to change the name of the ship to the Exodus 1947, to the resentment of the American crew, some of whom wanted it to be called the Eleanor Roosevelt. A row erupted as they approached the coast of Palestine and the ship found itself hemmed in by British destroyers. For Harel, and the Zionists in Palestine, they had proved their point and Harel ordered Ike to surrender. Ike refused and set in motion plans to repel the forces attempting to board, hitting them with missiles which included tins of kosher corned beef. On 18 July, the British overwhelmed the ship, shooting a 16-year-old in the face and clubbing an American crew member to death. The passengers were later returned to Germany on the orders of Ernest Bevin, Clement Attlee&apos;s foreign secretary, where they were detained in the British-occupied zone. For Ike, the brutal treatment of the passengers was a PR triumph, with headlines such as &quot;Return to the Reich&quot;. Ike would later say: &quot;If there is an Almighty, he sent us Ernest Bevin in order to create a Jewish state.&quot; And in a letter at the time, he wrote: &quot;If we have one more defeat like this, Britain&apos;s empire will sink into oblivion.&quot; After the war, Ike set himself up as a shipping owner, running lines to China, Singapore and Iran. In the early 1950s, he had a falling-out with the Israeli prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who broke a shipping strike, which caused Ike to move to the right. The feud with Harel, who died in 2008, was continued to his dying breath. The novelist Yoram Kaniuk, writing in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, sees the playing out of the struggle between the two men as the story of Zionism itself: &quot;Ike wanted Yossi to continue the war to show that we were heroes and in order to beat the British and Yossi said he didn&apos;t bring the ship so that 4,500 Holocaust survivors would be killed, and if Ike&apos;s Palmach wanted war he should bring the young people from the kibbutzim. Ike didn&apos;t forgive him \u2026 Yossi wanted life. Ike wanted struggle and victory.&quot; Ike married a non-Jewish American, who predeceased him, and they had two daughters. In the 1960s, he studied for a master&apos;s degree in business administration at Columbia University, New York, but he remained, definitively, a man of the sea, building himself a large white house in the shape of a ship&apos;s prow overlooking the Mediterranean. It was difficult to visit him, because he refused to give anyone his address after the municipality renamed his street after his enemy Ben-Gurion. He became increasingly cantankerous in his later years. In 2007, 60 years after the Exodus voyage, he briefly hit the headlines again, when he appeared in court charged with having driven without a licence for 18 years. The Israeli president Shimon Peres diplomatically delivered a eulogy on behalf of the state: &quot;He was tenacious, and he had tremendous leadership capacity. Ike wasn&apos;t keen on taking a path paved by someone else.&quot; He is survived by his daughters, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. \u2022 Yitzhak (Ike) Aronowitz, naval captain, born 1923, died 23 December 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/28/sex-internet-india-law", "sentences": ["The block also applies to users in Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea.", "ID is based in Singapore, Hong Kong, India or Korea you will only be able to view safe content based on your local terms of service (this means you won&apos;t be able to turn SafeSearch off).&quot;"], "publicationDate": "2009-12-28T18:07:13Z", "title": "No internet sex please, we're Indian.

Search engine reports suggest that users in India are responsible for more searches for &quot;sex&quot; than those in any other country. Its popular daily newspapers are packed with pictures of young women in states of undress and Bollywood oozes sexuality from every pore. But at the same time it remains a deeply religious country in which traditionalists regularly take violent offence at anything deemed to be too suggestive. The latest attempts to constrain internet users come at a time when the vexed subject of sexual behaviour is once again dominating the domestic headlines. Last week an Indian news channel broadcast video footage of a man said to be the 86-year-old governor of Andhra Pradesh, Narayan Datt Tiwari, in bed with three young women. He quit on Sunday, citing health reasons and still denying that the man in the video was him. Today there was also mixed news for the tens of thousands of fans of India&apos;s most popular \u2013 and only \u2013 cartoon porn star, Savita Bhabhi. The sexual antics of the energetic housewife won her website a daily audience of nearly 200,000 visitors, until it was closed down by the Indian government in June. Now the site is back at a new web address but already it has fallen foul of the Internet Service Providers Association of India, whose president, Rajesh Chharia, warned that it faced closure again because its content was &quot;not acceptable to our culture&quot;.

You might call it a vintage year for cheating, a year when cheating seemed to be not just more widespread, but also more richly textured. From the hoopla surrounding Portugal&apos;s teenager Michelle Larcher de\u00a0Brito&apos;s 109 decibel mid-point scream at Wimbledon, to news that one of the Queen&apos;s horses had been doped, the bar has been raised. The suspicion is we&apos;re not just cheating more, we&apos;re cheating better. In spite of which \u2013 and this being professional sport \u2013 even 2009&apos;s most ambitious acts of cheating have tended to be spiced with a tinge of low comedy. The year&apos;s central piece of cheating was the Harlequins rugby union Bloodgate scandal. The details are familiar but bear repeating if only to emphasise their sweeping reach and scale. The deception took in the club officer buying blood capsules in a Clapham joke shop; the winger Tom Williams leaving the field during a Heineken Cup quarter-final with a pint of unconvincing thin scarlet liquid pouring from his mouth to allow a convenient &quot;blood substitution&quot;; the club doctor who allegedly slashed Williams&apos;s mouth with a scalpel to muddy the waters; and the widely brokered cover-up. This is an Ebola virus of cheating, a Hogarthian tableau of the contagion of the tiny lie. It is also Beano-level stuff. The Harlequins coach Dean Richards, (now banned for three years) was painted as a calculating cold-hearted mastermind, but frankly this is a terrible slur on calculating cold-hearted masterminds everywhere. Plus, rugby was supposed to stand for something, that vaguely militaristic sense of bull-necked decency. Unlike the diabolical funhouse of Formula One \u2013 less a sport and more a portable never\u2011ending after-party on a yacht peopled by disco-dancing billionaires \u2013 which provided the second most jaw\u2011dropping cheat scandal of 2009. This was the news that Flavio Briatore, the Renault principal, had ordered his driver Nelson Piquet Jr to crash into a wall at last year&apos;s Singapore grand prix in order to fix a race. Such things pass quickly, though. Briatore was banned for life but the sport continued to thrum and rev and guitar-solo along with barely a plucked eyebrow raised. So much for calculated acts of cheating. The instinctive cheat also thrived this year. Most notably Thierry Henry used his hand to help set up the goal that eliminated Ireland from World Cup qualifying. Henry admitted his handball and even said sorry, but still endured a tsunami of social networking site-based wrath, which is sure to resurface in some form at next year&apos;s World Cup: for the full effect probably best to watch France&apos;s games in an Irish pub. Diving has continued to be the most divisive \u2013 and perhaps only \u2013 non\u2011negotiable point of honour in British football. Arsenal&apos;s Eduardo da Silva was banned for two matches (later rescinded) for falling too easily against Celtic. But happily for the domestic game it turns out this is a failing limited entirely to overseas players, as proved conclusively by the lack of similar frothing indignation directed at Wayne Rooney, whose brief dizzy spell and stumble accidently won a penalty for England against Slovenia. Off the field the failed dope test continued to provide a jangling timpani to the year of the cheat. There were some oddities. The Italian footballer Fabio Cannavaro failed a test but successfully explained that he had simply been taking medication for a bee sting. The world&apos;s top fast bowler Dale Steyn failed a test after taking migraine pills and was cleared. Strangest of all, it was almost with a sense of regretful nostalgia that we learnt not one of the 180 riders in this year&apos;s Tour de France failed a test. Which perhaps focuses the mind on what we really learnt about cheating this year. Cycling&apos;s biggest race has always been riddled with chicanery, but there was something almost magnificent about early Tour de France riders spiking each other&apos;s shorts with itching powder or attaching a piece of string to a towing car. These were people cheating with nothing but victory in mind, saved from total ignominy because what they craved above all was glory, by fair or foul means. Crucially, they weren&apos;t in it for the money. In 2009 cheating, like everything else in sport, has its complex economics. Bloodgate was apparently about money. Handball in football is as old as \u2013 and indeed the inspiration for \u2013 its first set of written rules: but before this year no handball had ever been worth a reported \u00a3100m to the victor&apos;s economy. The stakes are, wearyingly, ever higher. And even cheating has suffered during a year that taught us money can tarnish anything in sport, even the unsavoury delights of the unsporting."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/30/thatcher-snub-vietnamese-boat-people", "sentences": ["This proposal was blocked by Lee Kuan Yu of Singapore, who feared it might become a &quot;rival entrepreneurial city&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2009-12-30T00:05:20Z", "title": "Margaret Thatcher refused to give 10,000 Vietnamese 'boat people' refuge in Britain", "tags": ["National Archives", "Margaret Thatcher", "Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Margaret Thatcher initially refused to give 10,000 Vietnamese boat people refuge in Britain, privately warning her ministers that there would be riots on the streets if they were given council housing, Downing Street papers reveal. The papers also show how Thatcher told her foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, and her home secretary, Willie Whitelaw, that it was &quot;quite wrong that immigrants should be given council housing whereas white citizens were not&quot;. The Downing Street files provide shocking evidence that a personal element of racism, not evident in her public statements as prime minister, lay behind her reluctance to agree to a private and informal request from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees for Britain to take in 10,000 refugees who had fled Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in April 1975. The papers, released at the National Archives today, show that her reluctance to take in any of the Vietnamese boat people led to her making a proposal to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, that they jointly buy an Indonesian or Philippine island &quot;not only as a staging post but as a place of settlement&quot; for them all. This proposal was blocked by Lee Kuan Yu of Singapore, who feared it might become a &quot;rival entrepreneurial city&quot;. The new prime minister went on to tell Carrington and Whitelaw that those who were pressing the government to help the Vietnamese boat people &quot;should be invited to accept one into their homes&quot; and she asked if they could not simply be &quot;shifted from one warehouse in Hong Kong to another in the UK&quot;. At an earlier meeting, the Downing Street files show that she warned her colleagues that there &quot;would be riots in the streets if the government had to put refugees into council houses&quot;. By July 1979 more than 60,000 were in camps in Hong Kong, then still a British colony, and they were arriving at the rate of 500 a month. British merchant ships were continuing to pick up large numbers in the South China sea. Hundreds of thousands were fleeing Vietnam and Cambodia and Britain had led the calls for an international conference. Thatcher made it clear that any admission of Vietnamese boat people would have to be matched by a cut in the level of immigration to Britain, particularly in the admission of dependants. Thatcher said &quot;that she had far less objection to refugees, such as Rhodesians, Poles and Hungarians, since they could more easily be assimilated into British society&quot;. Her reluctance to take in Britain&apos;s UN quota of 10,000 was all the more embarrassing in that it came after Thatcher had lectured the Soviet premier, Alexey Kosygin, on the plight of the Vietnamese boat people after fleeing &quot;the tyranny of communism&quot;. Britain had also played a leading role in calling for a UN conference to tackle the humanitarian crisis in the South China seas. On 9 July in the run-up to the UN conference, the Downing Street files show that Carrington and Whitelaw cornered her in an informal meeting. Carrington gave a vivid first-hand account of conditions in the camps in Hong Kong and suggested that Britain take the 10,000 spread over two years, and those picked up by British sea captains should be included in the quota. Whitelaw made it clear that 3,000 a year could be accommodated in Britain without the need for extra camps. He also promised Thatcher a new crackdown on immigrant male fiances, saying that he was thinking of &quot;a kind of steeplechase designed to weed out south Asians in particular&quot;. The official minute says: &quot;The prime minister said, that on humanitarian grounds, she would much rather see the UK take in refugees than immigrants. With some exceptions there had been no humanitarian case for accepting 1\u00bd million immigrants from South Asia and elsewhere. It was essential to draw the line somewhere.&quot; When Whitelaw said his own postbag indicated a shift of opinion in favour of accepting more refugees, the prime minister said that &quot;in her view all those who wrote letters in this sense should be invited to accept one into their homes. She thought it was quite wrong that immigrants should be given council housing whereas white citizens were not.&quot; As the UN conference loomed, Thatcher relented and agreed that 10,000 should be let in, spread over three years, with a preference for those who spoke English and had no medical problems.

Today, the cabinet papers from Thatcher&apos;s earliest days in office are finally released under the 30-year rule. The 1979 files provide a fascinating insight into the way she took a grip, first of her ministers, then the country with a pugnacious style that is revealed in hostile handwritten remarks in the margins of previously secret documents. The Downing Street files show that within a month of taking office Thatcher told Geoffrey Howe, her chancellor, that the two Treasury papers on public spending cuts he put forward for their first budget were &quot;not nearly tough enough&quot; and that his proposal to double VAT to 15% would simply stoke inflation. A paper on pay policy by the employment secretary, Jim Prior, was so &quot;thoroughly deficient in content&quot; that she ordered it not to be circulated to the cabinet. Again and again her furious handwritten notes in the margins of the files reveal her impatience at the cautious approach of Whitehall and some of the &quot;wets&quot; in her own cabinet. &quot;This will not do&quot; makes regular appearances, as does &quot;too small&quot; whenever public spending cuts are being discussed. She just as often responded with her blue felt-tip pen with the single word &quot;no&quot;, heavily underlined. Her early struggles to reduce an \u00a38bn public spending borrowing requirement through spending cuts and increases in indirect taxes while cutting the basic rate of income tax to 30p are an object lesson for any incoming prime minister next year faced with a deficit of \u00a3176bn. The files show that at her first meeting with the Soviet premier, Alexey Kosygin, the woman they had dubbed the &quot;iron lady&quot; lectured him on the plight of the hundreds of thousands of boat people risking their lives fleeing communist Vietnam after he suggested that they were all drug-takers or criminals. &quot;The prime minister told Mr Kosygin that the refugees who were being picked up by British ships were \u2026 hardworking people, not drug addicts, and a high proportion of them were children.&quot; But the Downing Street papers also disclose a shocking degree of personal racism in her own response to the Vietnamese boat people, initially resisting an informal UN request that Britain take 10,000 refugees on the grounds that there would be riots in the streets if they were given council housing ahead of &quot;white citizens&quot;. She made clear to her cabinet colleagues that she had &quot;less objection to refugees such as Rhodesians, Poles and Hungarians, since they could more easily be assimilated into British society&quot;. Mrs Thatcher even bizarrely proposed to the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, that they jointly buy an Indonesian island to resettle all the boat people. This forerunner of Oliver Letwin&apos;s 2003 idea for an &quot;asylum island&quot; to take all of Britain&apos;s asylum seekers was only blocked when Singapore complained that it would set up a rival entrepreneurial city. The files disclose that Thatcher&apos;s first months in power reveal a torrent of pungent political aphorisms that were to sustain her in power for the next 13 years. Vetoing Lord Carrington&apos;s suggestion that Foreign Office negotiators should meet Robert Mugabe before the Rhodesia/Zimbabwe settlement, the prime minister scribbled in the margin of one letter: &quot;No \u2013 Please do not meet leaders of the &apos;Patriotic Front&apos;. I have never [underlined] done business with terrorists until they become prime ministers. MT&quot; An enthusiast for nuclear power, Thatcher admitted in a dispatch about Pakistan&apos;s ambitions: &quot;There was little one could do if a country was determined to obtain nuclear weaponry.&quot; A letter from July 1978, while she was still leader of the opposition, reveals Thatcher&apos;s legally inspired reluctance to concede that mistakes had ever been made. Opposing plans to publish a history of military intelligence in the second world war, she observed: &quot;I was taught a very good rule by my two Masters at Law, both of whom are now judges: never admit anything unless you have to; and then only for specific reasons and within defined limits.&quot; As for the &quot;karate ladies&quot;, the cabinet secretary, Sir John Hunt, rejected the Japanese proposal for an all-female protection squad at the Tokyo summit, saying that Thatcher was going as &quot;prime minister, and not as a woman per se&quot;.

Addressed to the Nguyen family, she expressed sympathy to the person who wrote of their longing to see their family reunited after being wrenched apart as hundreds of thousands of boat people fled Vietnam. Thatcher wrote: &quot;I know what terrible sufferings have been endured by refugees from your country. That was why I first proposed that the United Nations secretary general should call a conference to work out practical measures to help them. We are taking a full part in this international effort and have decided to accept another 10,000 refugees into this country.&quot; She ends the letter by writing: &quot;Like you, I hope it will not be long before you are a united family again.&quot; Even for those who disliked Thatcher and her domestic policies, the decision to accept 10,000 Vietnamese stands out as an act of high statesmanship, even of nobility. The letter that Thatcher wrote to the Nguyen familty, which can be found on the Margaret Thatcher foundation website, showed that there was a beating heart in the Iron Lady. Those Vietnamese who were allowed to come to Britain to start a new life must have felt a deep sense of gratitude to Thatcher for acting as she did in 1979. But 30 years on, she emerges in a much less flattering light, as revealed in newly-released Downing Street papers. The papers, released by the National Archives, showed that she only very reluctantly agreed to take the Vietnamese refugees and only did so after much arm-twisting by Lord Carrington, then foreign secretary, and William Whitelaw, then home secretary. These are the real heroes behind the decision by Britain to accept 10,000 Vietnamese refugees. The number was first suggested by the UN high commissioner for refugees in Geneva, Paul Hartling, in advance of a UN conference to deal with the boat people crisis. By July 1979 more than 60,000 were in camps in Hong Kong, then still a British colony, and they were arriving at the rate of 500 a month. British merchant ships were continuing to pick up large numbers making the hazardous journey across the South China sea, where they risked attack from Thai pirates or death at sea. When Downing Street got wind that the Sunday Telegraph was about to publish a story about Britain&apos;s willingness to accept the 10,000, its immediate reaction was to pooh-pooh the story. Thatcher&apos;s initial reaction was that &quot;there are great difficulties in any further significant intake of refugees in the UK&quot;. The papers make it quite clear that Thatcher was far from magnanimous. She warned of riots on the streets if Vietnamese refugees were given council housing. She even proposed jointly buying with Australia an Indonesian or Philippine island for the refugees, a plan that was blocked by Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, who feared it might become a &quot;rival entrepreneurial city&quot;. She also said &quot;that she had far less objection to refugees, such as Rhodesians, Poles and Hungarians, since they could more easily be assimilated into British society&quot;. Thatcher only relented because of pressure from Carrington \u2013 who had seen the camps in Hong Kong at first hand \u2013 and Whitelaw, who said 3,000 Vietnamese refugees a year could be accommodated in Britain without the need for extra camps. Whitelaw pointed out that most of the Conservative party favoured taking in the refugees as did all the junior ministers in the Home Office. He mentioned that his own correspondence indicated a shift of opinion in favour of accepting more refugees, prompting Thatcher&apos;s mean retort that those writing such letters &quot;should be invited to accept one into their homes&quot;. Despite his reputation as a wet, Whitelaw took a strong stand. &quot;It is necessary that we should have a positive and defensible policy towards refugees from a brutal communist tyranny,&quot; the home secretary said. As for Carrington, he pointed out that Britain would look pretty bad if it did not come up with a signficant offer especially as the UN conference was Thatcher&apos;s idea to start with. Thatcher also came under strong international pressure. Menachem Begin, the Israeli prime minister, had written to Thatcher in June 1979 criticising her idea of a conference and suggested that each country accept a certain number of refugees as a way of dealing with &quot;this horrific tragedy&quot;. Eventually Thatcher relented and decided that yes, Britain would take 10,000 Vietnamese refugees. But as we now know, she had to be dragged kicking and screaming into accepting them. For those Vietnamese refugees who may have admired Thatcher and her stand in 1979, 30 years on it&apos;s clear that Carrington and Whitelaw are the people they should really thank."}]}
